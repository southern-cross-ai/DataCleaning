  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOldMateOfYourFathers"></a>An Old Mate Of Your Father&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>You remember when we hurried home from the old bush school how we were sometimes
    startled by a bearded apparition, who smiled kindly down on us, and whom
    our mother introduced, as we raked off our hats, as &ldquo;An old mate of
    your father&rsquo;s on the diggings, Johnny.&rdquo; And he would pat our
    heads and say we were fine boys, or girls&mdash;as the case may have been&mdash;and
    that we had our father&rsquo;s nose but our mother&rsquo;s eyes, or the other
    way about; and say that the baby was the dead spit of its mother, and then
    added, for father&rsquo;s benefit: &ldquo;But yet he&rsquo;s like you, Tom.&rdquo; It
    did seem strange to the children to hear him address the old man by his Christian
    name&mdash;considering that the mother always referred to him as &ldquo;Father.&rdquo; She
    called the old mate Mr So-and-so, and father called him Bill, or something
    to that effect.</p>
  <p>Occasionally the old mate would come dressed in the latest city fashion,
    and at other times in a new suit of reach-me-downs, and yet again he would
    turn up in clean white moleskins, washed tweed coat, Crimean shirt, blucher
    boots, soft felt hat, with a fresh-looking speckled handkerchief round his
    neck. But his face was mostly round and brown and jolly, his hands were always
    horny, and his beard grey. Sometimes he might have seemed strange and uncouth
    to us at first, but the old man never appeared the least surprised at anything
    he said or did&mdash;they understood each other so well&mdash;and we would
    soon take to this relic of our father&rsquo;s past, who would have fruit
    or lollies for us&mdash;strange that he always remembered them&mdash;and
    would surreptitiously slip &ldquo;shilluns&rdquo; into our dirty little hands,
    and tell us stories about the old days, &ldquo;when me an&rsquo; yer father
    was on the diggin&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; you wasn&rsquo;t thought of, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sometimes the old mate would stay over Sunday, and in the forenoon or after
    dinner he and father would take a walk amongst the deserted shafts of Sapling
    Gully or along Quartz Ridge, and criticize old ground, and talk of past diggers&rsquo;  mistakes,
    and second bottoms, and feelers, and dips, and leads&mdash;also outcrops&mdash;and
    absently pick up pieces of quartz and slate, rub them on their sleeves, look
    at them in an abstracted manner, and drop them again; and they would talk
    of some old lead they had worked on: &ldquo;Hogan&rsquo;s party was here
    on one side of us, Macintosh was here on the other, Mac was getting good
    gold and so was Hogan, and now, why the blanky blank weren&rsquo;t we on
    gold?&rdquo; And the mate would always agree that there was  &ldquo;gold
    in them ridges and gullies yet, if a man only had the money behind him to
    git at it.&rdquo; And then perhaps the guv&rsquo;nor would show him a spot
    where he intended to put down a shaft some day&mdash;the old man was always
    thinking of putting down a shaft. And these two old fifty-niners would mooch
    round and sit on their heels on the sunny mullock heaps and break clay lumps
    between their hands, and lay plans for the putting down of shafts, and smoke,
    till an urchin was sent to &ldquo;look for his father and Mr So-and-so, and
    tell &rsquo;em to come to their dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And again&mdash;mostly in the fresh of the morning&mdash;they would hang
    about the fences on the selection and review the live stock: five dusty skeletons
    of cows, a hollow-sided calf or two, and one shocking piece of equine scenery&mdash;which,
    by the way, the old mate always praised. But the selector&rsquo;s heart was
    not in farming nor on selections&mdash;it was far away with the last new
    rush in Western Australia or Queensland, or perhaps buried in the worked-out
    ground of Tambaroora, Married Man&rsquo;s Creek, or Araluen; and by-and-by
    the memory of some half-forgotten reef or lead or Last Chance, Nil Desperandum,
    or Brown Snake claim would take their thoughts far back and away from the
    dusty patch of sods and struggling sprouts called the crop, or the few discouraged,
    half-dead slips which comprised the orchard. Then their conversation would
    be pointed with many Golden Points, Bakery Hill, Deep Creeks, Maitland Bars,
    Specimen Flats, and Chinamen&rsquo;s Gullies. And so they&rsquo;d yarn till
    the youngster came to tell them that &ldquo;Mother sez the breakfus is gettin&rsquo; cold,&rdquo; and
    then the old mate would rouse himself and stretch and say, &ldquo;Well, we
    mustn&rsquo;t keep the missus waitin&rsquo;, Tom!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, after tea, they would sit on a log of the wood-heap, or the edge of
    the veranda&mdash;that is, in warm weather&mdash;and yarn about Ballarat
    and Bendigo&mdash;of the days when we spoke of being on a place oftener than
    at it: <i>on</i> Ballarat, <i>on</i> Gulgong, <i>on</i> Lambing Flat, on <i>Creswick</i>&mdash;and
    they would use the definite article before the names, as: &ldquo;on The Turon;
    The Lachlan; The Home Rule; The Canadian Lead.&rdquo; Then again they&rsquo;d
    yarn of old mates, such as Tom Brook, Jack Henright, and poor Martin Ratcliffe&mdash;who
    was killed in his golden hole&mdash;and of other men whom they didn&rsquo;t
    seem to have known much about, and who went by the names of &ldquo;Adelaide
    Adolphus,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Corney George,&rdquo; and other names which might
    have been more or less applicable.</p>
  <p>And sometimes they&rsquo;d get talking, low and mysterious like, about &ldquo;Th&rsquo;  Eureka
    Stockade;&rdquo; and if we didn&rsquo;t understand and asked questions, &ldquo;what
    was the Eureka Stockade?&rdquo; or &ldquo;what did they do it for?&rdquo; father&rsquo;d
    say: &ldquo;Now, run away, sonny, and don&rsquo;t bother; me and Mr So-and-so
    want to talk.&rdquo; Father had the mark of a hole on his leg, which he said
    he got through a gun accident when a boy, and a scar on his side, that we
    saw when he was in swimming with us; he said he got that in an accident in
    a quartz-crushing machine. Mr So-and-so had a big scar on the side of his
    forehead that was caused by a pick accidentally slipping out of a loop in
    the rope, and falling down a shaft where he was working. But how was it they
    talked low, and their eyes brightened up, and they didn&rsquo;t look at each
    other, but away over sunset, and had to get up and walk about, and take a
    stroll in the cool of the evening when they talked about Eureka?</p>
  <p>And, again they&rsquo;d talk lower and more mysterious like, and perhaps
    mother would be passing the wood-heap and catch a word, and asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who was she, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&mdash;father&mdash;would say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t know her, Mary; she belonged to a family Bill
    knew at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Bill would look solemn till mother had gone, and then they would smile
    a quiet smile, and stretch and say, &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; and start something
    else.</p>
  <p>They had yarns for the fireside, too, some of those old mates of our father&rsquo;s,
    and one of them would often tell how a girl&mdash;a queen of the diggings&mdash;was
    married, and had her wedding-ring made out of the gold of that field; and
    how the diggers weighed their gold with the new wedding-ring&mdash;for luck&mdash;by
    hanging the ring on the hook of the scales and attaching their chamois-leather
    gold bags to it (whereupon she boasted that four hundred ounces of the precious
    metal passed through her wedding-ring); and how they lowered the young bride,
    blindfolded, down a golden hole in a big bucket, and got her to point out
    the drive from which the gold came that her ring was made out of. The point
    of this story seems to have been lost&mdash;or else we forget it&mdash;but
    it was characteristic. Had the girl been lowered down a duffer, and asked
    to point out the way to the gold, and had she done so successfully, there
    would have been some sense in it.</p>
  <p>And they would talk of King, and Maggie Oliver, and G. V. Brooke, and others,
    and remember how the diggers went five miles out to meet the coach that brought
    the girl actress, and took the horses out and brought her in in triumph,
    and worshipped her, and sent her off in glory, and threw nuggets into her
    lap. And how she stood upon the box-seat and tore her sailor hat to pieces,
    and threw the fragments amongst the crowd; and how the diggers fought for
    the bits and thrust them inside their shirt bosoms; and how she broke down
    and cried, and could in her turn have worshipped those men&mdash;loved them,
    every one. They were boys all, and gentlemen all. There were college men,
    artists, poets, musicians, journalists&mdash;Bohemians all. Men from all
    the lands and one. They understood art&mdash;and poverty was dead.</p>
  <p>And perhaps the old mate would say slyly, but with a sad, quiet smile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got that bit of straw yet, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Those old mates had each three pasts behind them. The two they told each
    other when they became mates, and the one they had shared.</p>
  <p>And when the visitor had gone by the coach we noticed that the old man would
    smoke a lot, and think as much, and take great interest in the fire, and
    be a trifle irritable perhaps.</p>
  <p>Those old mates of our father&rsquo;s are getting few and far between, and
    only happen along once in a way to keep the old man&rsquo;s memory fresh,
    as it were. We met one to-day, and had a yarn with him, and afterwards we
    got thinking, and somehow began to wonder whether those ancient friends of
    ours were, or were not, better and kinder to their mates than we of the rising
    generation are to our fathers; and the doubt is painfully on the wrong side.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SettlingOnTheLand"></a>Settling On The Land</b></h2>
  <p>The worst bore in Australia just now is the man who raves about getting
    the people on the land, and button-holes you in the street with a little
    scheme of his own. He generally does not know what he is talking about.</p>
  <p>There is in Sydney a man named Tom Hopkins who settled on the land once,
    and sometimes you can get him to talk about it. He did very well at his trade
    in the city, years ago, until he began to think that he could do better up-country.
    Then he arranged with his sweetheart to be true to him and wait whilst he
    went west and made a home. She drops out of the story at this point.</p>
  <p>He selected on a run at Dry Hole Creek, and for months awaited the arrival
    of the government surveyors to fix his boundaries; but they didn&rsquo;t
    come, and, as he had no reason to believe they would turn up within the next
    ten years, he grubbed and fenced at a venture, and started farming operations.</p>
  <p>Does the reader know what grubbing means? Tom does. He found the biggest,
    ugliest, and most useless trees on his particular piece of ground; also the
    greatest number of adamantine stumps. He started without experience, or with
    very little, but with plenty of advice from men who knew less about farming
    than he did. He found a soft place between two roots on one side of the first
    tree, made a narrow, irregular hole, and burrowed down till he reached a
    level where the tap-root was somewhat less than four feet in diameter, and
    not quite as hard as flint: then he found that he hadn&rsquo;t room to swing
    the axe, so he heaved out another ton or two of earth&mdash;and rested. Next
    day he sank a shaft on the other side of the gum; and after tea, over a pipe,
    it struck him that it would be a good idea to burn the tree out, and so use
    up the logs and lighter rubbish lying round. So he widened the excavation,
    rolled in some logs, and set fire to them&mdash;with no better result than
    to scorch the roots.</p>
  <p>Tom persevered. He put the trace harness on his horse, drew in all the logs
    within half a mile, and piled them on the windward side of that gum; and
    during the night the fire found a soft place, and the tree burnt off about
    six feet above the surface, falling on a squatter&rsquo;s boundary fence,
    and leaving the ugliest kind of stump to occupy the selector&rsquo;s attention;
    which it did, for a week. He waited till the hole cooled, and then he went
    to work with pick, shovel, and axe: and even now he gets interested in drawings
    of machinery, such as are published in the agricultural weeklies, for getting
    out stumps without graft. He thought he would be able to get some posts and
    rails out of that tree, but found reason to think that a cast-iron column
    would split sooner&mdash;and straighter. He traced some of the surface roots
    to the other side of the selection, and broke most of his trace-chains trying
    to get them out by horse-power&mdash;for they had other roots going down
    from underneath. He cleared a patch in the course of time and for several
    seasons he broke more ploughshares than he could pay for.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the squatter was not idle. Tom&rsquo;s tent was robbed several
    times, and his hut burnt down twice. Then he was charged with killing some
    sheep and a steer on the run, and converting them to his own use, but got
    off mainly because there was a difference of opinion between the squatter
    and the other local J.P. concerning politics and religion.</p>
  <p>Tom ploughed and sowed wheat, but nothing came up to speak of&mdash;the
    ground was too poor; so he carted stable manure six miles from the nearest
    town, manured the land, sowed another crop, and prayed for rain. It came.
    It raised a flood which washed the crop clean off the selection, together
    with several acres of manure, and a considerable portion of the original
    surface soil; and the water brought down enough sand to make a beach, and
    spread it over the field to a depth of six inches. The flood also took half
    a mile of fencing from along the creek-bank, and landed it in a bend, three
    miles down, on a dummy selection, where it was confiscated.</p>
  <p>Tom didn&rsquo;t give up&mdash;he was energetic. He cleared another piece
    of ground on the siding, and sowed more wheat; it had the rust in it, or
    the smut&mdash;and averaged three shillings per bushel. Then he sowed lucerne
    and oats, and bought a few cows: he had an idea of starting a dairy. First,
    the cows&rsquo; eyes got bad, and he sought the advice of a German cocky,
    and acted upon it; he blew powdered alum through paper tubes into the bad
    eyes, and got some of it snorted and butted back into his own. He cured the
    cows&rsquo; eyes and got the sandy blight in his own, and for a week or so
    be couldn&rsquo;t tell one end of a cow from the other, but sat in a dark
    corner of the hut and groaned, and soaked his glued eyelashes in warm water.
    Germany stuck to him and nursed him, and saw him through.</p>
  <p>Then the milkers got bad udders, and Tom took his life in his hands whenever
    he milked them. He got them all right presently&mdash;and butter fell to
    fourpence a pound. He and the aforesaid cocky made arrangements to send their
    butter to a better market; and then the cows contracted a disease which was
    known in those parts as &ldquo;plooro permoanyer,&rdquo; but generally referred
    to as &ldquo;th&rsquo; ploorer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again Tom sought advice, acting upon which he slit the cows&rsquo; ears,
    cut their tails half off to bleed them, and poured pints of &ldquo;pain killer&rdquo; into
    them through their nostrils; but they wouldn&rsquo;t make an effort, except,
    perhaps, to rise and poke the selector when he tried to tempt their appetites
    with slices of immature pumpkin. They died peacefully and persistently, until
    all were gone save a certain dangerous, barren, slab-sided luny bovine with
    white eyes and much agility in jumping fences, who was known locally as Queen
    Elizabeth.</p>
  <p>Tom shot Queen Elizabeth, and turned his attention to agriculture again.
    Then his plough horses took bad with some thing the Teuton called &ldquo;der
    shtranguls.&rdquo;  He submitted them to a course of treatment in accordance
    with Jacob&rsquo;s advice&mdash;and they died.</p>
  <p>Even then Tom didn&rsquo;t give in&mdash;there was grit in that man. He
    borrowed a broken-down dray-horse in return for its keep, coupled it with
    his own old riding hack, and started to finish ploughing. The team wasn&rsquo;t
    a success. Whenever the draught horse&rsquo;s knees gave way and he stumbled
    forward, he jerked the lighter horse back into the plough, and something
    would break. Then Tom would blaspheme till he was refreshed, mend up things
    with wire and bits of clothes-line, fill his pockets with stones to throw
    at the team, and start again. Finally he hired a dummy&rsquo;s child to drive
    the horses. The brat did his best he tugged at the head of the team, prodded
    it behind, heaved rocks at it, cut a sapling, got up his enthusiasm, and
    wildly whacked the light horse whenever the other showed signs of moving&mdash;but
    he never succeeded in starting both horses at one and the same time. Moreover
    the youth was cheeky, and the selector&rsquo;s temper had been soured: he
    cursed the boy along with the horses, the plough, the selection, the squatter,
    and Australia. Yes, he cursed Australia. The boy cursed back, was chastised,
    and immediately went home and brought his father.</p>
  <p>Then the dummy&rsquo;s dog tackled the selector&rsquo;s dog and this precipitated
    things. The dummy would have gone under had his wife not arrived on the scene
    with the eldest son and the rest of the family. They all fell foul of Tom.
    The woman was the worst. The selector&rsquo;s dog chawed the other and came
    to his master&rsquo;s rescue just in time&mdash;or Tom Hopkins would never
    have lived to become the inmate of a lunatic asylum.</p>
  <p>Next year there happened to be good grass on Tom&rsquo;s selection and nowhere
    else, and he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea&mdash;to get a few poor
    sheep, and fatten them up for market: sheep were selling for about seven-and-sixpence
    a dozen at that time. Tom got a hundred or two, but the squatter had a man
    stationed at one side of the selection with dogs to set on the sheep directly
    they put their noses through the fence (Tom&rsquo;s was not a sheep fence).
    The dogs chased the sheep across the selection and into the run again on
    the other side, where another man waited ready to pound them.</p>
  <p>Tom&rsquo;s dog did his best; but he fell sick while chawing up the fourth
    capitalistic canine, and subsequently died. The dummies had robbed that cur
    with poison before starting it across&mdash;that was the only way they could
    get at Tom&rsquo;s dog.</p>
  <p>Tom thought that two might play at the game, and he tried; but his nephew,
    who happened to be up from the city on a visit, was arrested at the instigation
    of the squatter for alleged sheep-stealing, and sentenced to two years&rsquo; hard;
    during which time the selector himself got six months for assaulting the
    squatter with intent to do him grievous bodily harm-which, indeed, he more
    than attempted, if a broken nose, a fractured jaw, and the loss of most of
    the squatters&rsquo; teeth amounted to anything. The squatter by this time
    had made peace with the other local Justice, and had become his father-in-law.</p>
  <p>When Tom came out there was little left for him to live for; but he took
    a job of fencing, got a few pounds together, and prepared to settle on the
    land some more. He got a &ldquo;missus&rdquo; and a few cows during the next
    year; the missus robbed him and ran away with the dummy, and the cows died
    in the drought, or were impounded by the squatter while on their way to water.
    Then Tom rented an orchard up the creek, and a hailstorm destroyed all the
    fruit. Germany happened to be represented at the time, Jacob having sought
    shelter at Tom&rsquo;s hut on his way home from town. Tom stood leaning against
    the door post with the hail beating on him through it all. His eyes were
    very bright and very dry, and every breath was a choking sob. Jacob let him
    stand there, and sat inside with a dreamy expression on his hard face, thinking
    of childhood and fatherland, perhaps. When it was over he led Tom to a stool
    and said, &ldquo;You waits there, Tom. I must go home for somedings. You
    sits there still and waits twenty minutes;&rdquo; then he got on his horse
    and rode off muttering to himself; &ldquo;Dot man moost gry, dot man moost
    gry.&rdquo; He was back inside of twenty minutes with a bottle of wine and
    a cornet under his overcoat. He poured the wine into two pint-pots, made
    Tom drink, drank himself, and then took his cornet, stood up at the door,
    and played a German march into the rain after the retreating storm. The hail
    had passed over his vineyard and he was a ruined man too. Tom did &ldquo;gry&rdquo;  and
    was all right. He was a bit disheartened, but he did another job of fencing,
    and was just beginning to think about &ldquo;puttin&rsquo; in a few vines
    an&rsquo; fruit-trees&rdquo; when the government surveyors&mdash;whom he&rsquo;d
    forgotten all about&mdash;had a resurrection and came and surveyed, and found
    that the real selection was located amongst some barren ridges across the
    creek. Tom reckoned it was lucky he didn&rsquo;t plant the orchard, and he
    set about shifting his home and fences to the new site. But the squatter
    interfered at this point, entered into possession of the farm and all on
    it, and took action against the selector for trespass&mdash;laying the damages
    at &pound;2500.</p>
  <p>Tom was admitted to the lunatic asylum at Parramatta next year, and the
    squatter was sent there the following summer, having been ruined by the drought,
    the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-ring. The two became very friendly, and
    had many a sociable argument about the feasibility&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;of
    blowing open the flood-gates of Heaven in a dry season with dynamite.</p>
  <p>Tom was discharged a few years since. He knocks about certain suburbs a
    good deal. He is seen in daylight seldom, and at night mostly in connection
    with a dray and a lantern. He says his one great regret is that he wasn&rsquo;t
    found to be of unsound mind before he went up-country.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="EnterMitchell"></a>Enter Mitchell</b></h2>
  <p>The Western train had just arrived at Redfern railway station with a lot
    of ordinary passengers and one swagman.</p>
  <p>He was short, and stout, and bow-legged, and freckled, and sandy. He had
    red hair and small, twinkling, grey eyes, and&mdash;what often goes with
    such things&mdash;the expression of a born comedian. He was dressed in a
    ragged, well-washed print shirt, an old black waistcoat with a calico back,
    a pair of cloudy moleskins patched at the knees and held up by a plaited
    greenhide belt buckled loosely round his hips, a pair of well-worn, fuzzy
    blucher boots, and a soft felt hat, green with age, and with no brim worth
    mentioning, and no crown to speak of. He swung a swag on to the platform,
    shouldered it, pulled out a billy and water-bag, and then went to a dog-box
    in the brake van.</p>
  <p>Five minutes later he appeared on the edge of the cab platform, with an
    anxious-looking cattle-dog crouching against his legs, and one end of the
    chain in his hand. He eased down the swag against a post, turned his face
    to the city, tilted his hat forward, and scratched the well-developed back
    of his head with a little finger. He seemed undecided what track to take.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cab, Sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The swagman turned slowly and regarded cabby with a quiet grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, do I look as if I want a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why not? No harm, anyway&mdash;I thought you might want a cab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swaggy scratched his head, reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the first man that has
    thought so these ten years. What do I want with a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To go where you&rsquo;re going, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do I look knocked up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say you did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t say you said I did.... Now, I&rsquo;ve been on
    the track this five years. I&rsquo;ve tramped two thousan&rsquo; miles since
    last Chris&rsquo;mas, and I don&rsquo;t see why I can&rsquo;t tramp the last
    mile. Do you think my old dog wants a cab?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dog shivered and whimpered; he seemed to want to get away from the crowd.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, you see, you ain&rsquo;t going to carry that swag through
    the streets, are you?&rdquo; asked the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Who&rsquo;ll stop me! There ain&rsquo;t no law agin it,
    I b&rsquo;lieve?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, you see, it don&rsquo;t look well, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I thought we&rsquo;d get to it at last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The traveller up-ended his bluey against his knee, gave it an affectionate
    pat, and then straightened himself up and looked fixedly at the cabman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; he said, sternly and impressively, &ldquo;can
    you see anything wrong with that old swag o&rsquo; mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a stout, dumpy swag, with a red blanket outside, patched with blue,
    and the edge of a blue blanket showing in the inner rings at the end. The
    swag might have been newer; it might have been cleaner; it might have been
    hooped with decent straps, instead of bits of clothes-line and greenhide&mdash;but
    otherwise there was nothing the matter with it, as swags go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve humped that old swag for years,&rdquo; continued the bushman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    carried that old swag thousands of miles&mdash;as that old dog knows&mdash;an&rsquo; no
    one ever bothered about the look of it, or of me, or of my old dog, neither;
    and do you think I&rsquo;m going to be ashamed of that old swag, for a cabby
    or anyone else? Do you think I&rsquo;m going to study anybody&rsquo;s feelings?
    No one ever studied mine! I&rsquo;m in two minds to summon you for using
    insulting language towards me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lifted the swag by the twisted towel which served for a shoulder-strap,
    swung it into the cab, got in himself and hauled the dog after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can drive me somewhere where I can leave my swag and dog while
    I get some decent clothes to see a tailor in,&rdquo; he said to the cabman. &ldquo;My
    old dog ain&rsquo;t used to cabs, you see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he added, reflectively: &ldquo;I drove a cab myself, once, for five
    years in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="StiffnerAndJim"></a>Stiffner And Jim<br>
      <font size="+1">(Thirdly, Bill)</font></b></h2>
  <p>We were tramping down in Canterbury, Maoriland, at the time, swagging it&mdash;me
    and Bill&mdash;looking for work on the new railway line. Well, one afternoon,
    after a long, hot tramp, we comes to Stiffner&rsquo;s Hotel&mdash;between
    Christchurch and that other place&mdash;I forget the name of it&mdash;with
    throats on us like sunstruck bones, and not the price of a stick of tobacco.</p>
  <p>We had to have a drink, anyway, so we chanced it. We walked right into the
    bar, handed over our swags, put up four drinks, and tried to look as if we&rsquo;d
    just drawn our cheques and didn&rsquo;t care a curse for any man. We looked
    solvent enough, as far as swagmen go. We were dirty and haggard and ragged
    and tired-looking, and that was all the more reason why we might have our
    cheques all right.</p>
  <p>This Stiffner was a hard customer. He&rsquo;d been a spieler, fighting man,
    bush parson, temperance preacher, and a policeman, and a commercial traveller,
    and everything else that was damnable; he&rsquo;d been a journalist, and
    an editor; he&rsquo;d been a lawyer, too. He was an ugly brute to look at,
    and uglier to have a row with&mdash;about six-foot-six, wide in proportion,
    and stronger than Donald Dinnie.</p>
  <p>He was meaner than a gold-field Chinaman, and sharper than a sewer rat:
    he wouldn&rsquo;t give his own father a feed, nor lend him a sprat&mdash;unless
    some safe person backed the old man&rsquo;s I.O.U.</p>
  <p>We knew that we needn&rsquo;t expect any mercy from Stiffner; but something
    had to be done, so I said to Bill:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s got to be done, Bill! What do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill was mostly a quiet young chap, from Sydney, except when he got drunk&mdash;which
    was seldom&mdash;and then he was a customer, from all round. He was cracked
    on the subject of spielers. He held that the population of the world was
    divided into two classes&mdash;one was spielers and the other was the mugs.
    He reckoned that he wasn&rsquo;t a mug. At first I thought he was a spieler,
    and afterwards I thought that he was a mug. He used to say that a man had
    to do it these times; that he was honest once and a fool, and was robbed
    and starved in consequences by his friends and relations; but now he intended
    to take all that he could get. He said that you either had to have or be
    had; that men were driven to be sharps, and there was no help for it.</p>
  <p>Bill said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to sharpen our teeth, that&rsquo;s all, and chew
    somebody&rsquo;s lug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>There was a lot of navvies at the pub, and I knew one or two by sight, so
    Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know one or two of these mugs. Bite one of their ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I took aside a chap that I knowed and bit his ear for ten bob,
    and gave it to Bill to mind, for I thought it would be safer with him than
    with me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang on to that,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t lose it for
    your natural life&rsquo;s sake, or Stiffner&rsquo;ll stiffen us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We put up about nine bob&rsquo;s worth of drinks that night&mdash;me and
    Bill&mdash;and Stiffner didn&rsquo;t squeal: he was too sharp. He shouted
    once or twice.</p>
  <p>By-and-by I left Bill and turned in, and in the morning when I woke up there
    was Bill sitting alongside of me, and looking about as lively as the fighting
    kangaroo in London in fog time. He had a black eye and eighteen pence. He&rsquo;d
    been taking down some of the mugs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Stiffner
    can smash us both with one hand, and if we don&rsquo;t pay up he&rsquo;ll
    pound our swags and cripple us. He&rsquo;s just the man to do it. He loves
    a fight even more than he hates being had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing to be done, Jim,&rdquo; says Bill, in
    a tired, disinterested tone that made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s than&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke be damned,&rdquo; I snarled, losing my temper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know dashed well that our swags are in the bar, and we can&rsquo;t
    smoke without them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; says Bill, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll toss you to see who&rsquo;s
    to face the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be blessed!&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see
    you further first. You have got a front. You mugged that stuff away, and
    you&rsquo;ll have to get us out of the mess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It made him wild to be called a mug, and we swore and growled at each other
    for a while; but we daren&rsquo;t speak loud enough to have a fight, so at
    last I agreed to toss up for it, and I lost.</p>
  <p>Bill started to give me some of his points, but I shut him up quick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had your turn, and made a mess of it,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;For
    God&rsquo;s sake give me a show. Now, I&rsquo;ll go into the bar and ask
    for the swags, and carry them out on to the veranda, and then go back to
    settle up. You keep him talking all the time. You dump the two swags together,
    and smoke like sheol. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I went into the bar, got the swags from the missus, carried them out on
    to the veranda, and then went back.</p>
  <p>Stiffner came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, sir,&rdquo; says Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a nice day, I think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. I suppose you are going on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll have to make a move to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I hooked carelessly on to the counter with one elbow, and looked dreamy-like
    out across the clearing, and presently I gave a sort of sigh and said:  &ldquo;Ah,
    well! I think I&rsquo;ll have a beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are! Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s round at the back. He&rsquo;ll be round directly;
    but he ain&rsquo;t drinking this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner laughed that nasty empty laugh of his. He thought Bill was whipping
    the cat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, boss?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thankee!... Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The country was pretty open round there&mdash;the nearest timber was better
    than a mile away, and I wanted to give Bill a good start across the flat
    before the go-as-you-can commenced; so I talked for a while, and while we
    were talking I thought I might as well go the whole hog&mdash;I might as
    well die for a pound as a penny, if I had to die; and if I hadn&rsquo;t I&rsquo;d
    have the pound to the good, anyway, so to speak. Anyhow, the risk would be
    about the same, or less, for I might have the spirit to run harder the more
    I had to run for&mdash;the more spirits I had to run for, in fact, as it
    turned out&mdash;so I says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll take one of them there flasks of whisky to last
    us on the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rdquo; says Stiffner. &ldquo;What&rsquo;ll ye
    have&mdash;a small one or a big one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, a big one, I think&mdash;if I can get it into my pocket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a tight squeeze,&rdquo; he said, and he laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Bet you two drinks I&rsquo;ll
    get it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The top inside coat-pocket, and no tearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a big bottle, and all my pockets were small; but I got it into the
    pocket he&rsquo;d betted against. It was a tight squeeze, but I got it in.</p>
  <p>Then we both laughed, but his laugh was nastier than usual, because it was
    meant to be pleasant, and he&rsquo;d lost two drinks; and my laugh wasn&rsquo;t
    easy&mdash;I was anxious as to which of us would laugh next.</p>
  <p>Just then I noticed something, and an idea struck me&mdash;about the most
    up-to-date idea that ever struck me in my life. I noticed that Stiffner was
    limping on his right foot this morning, so I said to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with your foot?&rdquo; putting my hand in my pocket. &ldquo;Oh,
    it&rsquo;s a crimson nail in my boot,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought I
    got the blanky thing out this morning; but I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There just happened to be an old bag of shoemaker&rsquo;s tools in the bar,
    belonging to an old cobbler who was lying dead drunk on the veranda. So I
    said, taking my hand out of my pocket again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lend us the boot, and I&rsquo;ll fix it in a minute. That&rsquo;s
    my old trade.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, so you&rsquo;re a shoemaker,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He laughs one of his useless laughs that wasn&rsquo;t wanted, and slips
    off the boot&mdash;he hadn&rsquo;t laced it up&mdash;and hands it across
    the bar to me. It was an ugly brute&mdash;a great thick, iron-bound, boiler-plated
    navvy&rsquo;s boot. It made me feel sore when I looked at it.</p>
  <p>I got the bag and pretended to fix the nail; but I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a couple of nails gone from the sole,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    put  &rsquo;em in if I can find any hobnails, and it&rsquo;ll save the sole,&rdquo; and
    I rooted in the bag and found a good long nail, and shoved it right through
    the sole on the sly. He&rsquo;d been a bit of a sprinter in his time, and
    I thought it might be better for me in the near future if the spikes of his
    running-shoes were inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There, you&rsquo;ll find that better, I fancy,&rdquo; I said, standing
    the boot on the bar counter, but keeping my hand on it in an absent-minded
    kind of way. Presently I yawned and stretched myself, and said in a careless
    way:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! How&rsquo;s the slate?&rdquo; He scratched the back of
    his head and pretended to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, we&rsquo;ll call it thirty bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps he thought I&rsquo;d slap down two quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and what will you do supposing we don&rsquo;t
    pay you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked blank for a moment. Then he fired up and gasped and choked once
    or twice; and then he cooled down suddenly and laughed his nastiest laugh&mdash;he
    was one of those men who always laugh when they&rsquo;re wild&mdash;and said
    in a nasty, quiet tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You thundering, jumped-up crawlers! If you don&rsquo;t (something)
    well part up I&rsquo;ll take your swags and (something) well kick your gory
    pants so you won&rsquo;t be able to sit down for a month&mdash;or stand up
    either!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the sooner you begin the better,&rdquo; I said; and I chucked
    the boot into a corner and bolted.</p>
  <p>He jumped the bar counter, got his boot, and came after me. He paused to
    slip the boot on&mdash;but he only made one step, and then gave a howl and
    slung the boot off and rushed back. When I looked round again he&rsquo;d
    got a slipper on, and was coming&mdash;and gaining on me, too. I shifted
    scenery pretty quick the next five minutes. But I was soon pumped. My heart
    began to beat against the ceiling of my head, and my lungs all choked up
    in my throat. When I guessed he was getting within kicking distance I glanced
    round so&rsquo;s to dodge the kick. He let out; but I shied just in time.
    He missed fire, and the slipper went about twenty feet up in the air and
    fell in a waterhole.</p>
  <p>He was done then, for the ground was stubbly and stony. I seen Bill on ahead
    pegging out for the horizon, and I took after him and reached for the timber
    for all I was worth, for I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner&rsquo;s missus coming with
    a shovel&mdash;to bury the remains, I suppose; and those two were a good
    match&mdash;Stiffner and his missus, I mean.</p>
  <p>Bill looked round once, and melted into the bush pretty soon after that.
    When I caught up he was about done; but I grabbed my swag and we pushed on,
    for I told Bill that I&rsquo;d seen Stiffner making for the stables when
    I&rsquo;d last looked round; and Bill thought that we&rsquo;d better get
    lost in the bush as soon as ever we could, and stay lost, too, for Stiffner
    was a man that couldn&rsquo;t stand being had.</p>
  <p>The first thing that Bill said when we got safe into camp was: &ldquo;I
    told you that we&rsquo;d pull through all right. You need never be frightened
    when you&rsquo;re travelling with me. Just take my advice and leave things
    to me, and we&rsquo;ll hang out all right. Now&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I shut him up. He made me mad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you&mdash;! What the sheol did <i>you</i> do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do?&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I got away with the swags, didn&rsquo;t
    I? Where&rsquo;d they be now if it wasn&rsquo;t for me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then I sat on him pretty hard for his pretensions, and paid him out for
    all the patronage he&rsquo;d worked off on me, and called him a mug straight,
    and walked round him, so to speak, and blowed, and told him never to pretend
    to me again that he was a battler.</p>
  <p>Then, when I thought I&rsquo;d licked him into form, I cooled down and soaped
    him up a bit; but I never thought that he had three climaxes and a crisis
    in store for me.</p>
  <p>He took it all pretty cool; he let me have my fling, and gave me time to
    get breath; then he leaned languidly over on his right side, shoved his left
    hand down into his left trouserpocket, and brought up a boot-lace, a box
    of matches, and nine-and-six.</p>
  <p>As soon as I got the focus of it I gasped:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the deuce did you get that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had it all along,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I seen at the pub
    that you had the show to chew a lug, so I thought we&rsquo;d save it&mdash;nine-and-sixpences
    ain&rsquo;t picked up every day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned over on his left, went down into the other pocket, and came
    up with a piece of tobacco and half-a-sovereign.</p>
  <p>My eyes bulged out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where the blazes did you get that from?&rdquo; I yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was the half-quid you give me last night.
    Half-quids ain&rsquo;t to be thrown away these times; and, besides, I had
    a down on Stiffner, and meant to pay him out; I reckoned that if we wasn&rsquo;t
    sharp enough to take him down we hadn&rsquo;t any business to be supposed
    to be alive. Anyway, I guessed we&rsquo;d do it; and so we did&mdash;and
    got a bottle of whisky into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he leaned back, tired-like, against the log, and dredged his upper
    left-hand waistcoat-pocket, and brought up a sovereign wrapped in a pound
    note. Then he waited for me to speak; but I couldn&rsquo;t. I got my mouth
    open, but couldn&rsquo;t get it shut again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got that out of the mugs last night, but I thought that we&rsquo;d
    want it, and might as well keep it. Quids ain&rsquo;t so easily picked up,
    nowadays; and, besides, we need stuff more&rsquo;n Stiffner does, and so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did he know you had the stuff?&rdquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the fun of it. That&rsquo;s what made him so
    excited. He was in the parlour all the time I was playing. But we might as
    well have a drink!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We did. I wanted it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill turned in by-and-by, and looked like a sleeping innocent in the moonlight.
    I sat up late, and smoked, and thought hard, and watched Bill, and turned
    in, and thought till near daylight, and then went to sleep, and had a nightmare
    about it. I dreamed I chased Stiffner forty miles to buy his pub, and that
    Bill turned out to be his nephew.</p>
  <p>Bill divvied up all right, and gave me half a crown over, but I didn&rsquo;t
    travel with him long after that. He was a decent young fellow as far as chaps
    go, and a good mate as far as mates go; but he was too far ahead for a peaceful,
    easy-going chap like me. It would have worn me out in a year to keep up to
    him.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;The name of this should have been: &lsquo;Bill and Stiffner (thirdly,
    Jim)&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b>When The Sun Went Down</b><a name="WhenTheSunWentDown"></a></h2>
  <p>Jack Drew sat on the edge of the shaft, with his foot in the loop and one
    hand on the rope, ready to descend. His elder brother, Tom, stood at one
    end of the windlass and the third mate at the other. Jack paused before swinging
    off, looked up at his brother, and impulsively held out his hand:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let the sun go down, are you, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tom kept both hands on the windlass-handle and said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lower away!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They lowered him to the bottom, and Tom shouldered his pick in silence and
    walked off to the tent. He found the tin plate, pint-pot, and things set
    ready for him on the rough slab table under the bush shed. The tea was made,
    the cabbage and potatoes strained and placed in a billy near the fire. He
    found the fried bacon and steak between two plates in the camp-oven. He sat
    down to the table but he could not eat. He felt mean. The inexperience and
    hasty temper of his brother had caused the quarrel between them that morning;
    but then Jack admitted that, and apologized when he first tried to make it
    up.</p>
  <p>Tom moved round uneasily and tried to smoke: he could not get Jack&rsquo;s
    last appeal out of his ears&mdash;&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let the
    sun go down, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom found himself glancing at the sun. It was less than two hours from sunset.
    He thought of the words of the old Hebrew&mdash;or Chinese&mdash;poet; he
    wasn&rsquo;t religious, and the authorship didn&rsquo;t matter. The old poet&rsquo;s
    words began to haunt him &ldquo;Let not the sun go down upon your wrath&mdash;Let
    not the sun go down upon your wrath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The line contains good, sound advice; for quick-tempered men are often the
    most sensitive, and when they let the sun go down on the aforesaid wrath
    that quality is likely to get them down and worry them during the night.</p>
  <p>Tom started to go to the claim, but checked himself, and sat down and tried
    to draw comfort from his pipe. He understood his brother thoroughly, but
    his brother never understood him&mdash;that was where the trouble was. Presently
    he got thinking how Jack would worry about the quarrel and have no heart
    for his work. Perhaps he was fretting over it now, all alone by himself,
    down at the end of the damp, dark drive. Tom had a lot of the old woman about
    him, in spite of his unsociable ways and brooding temper.</p>
  <p>He had almost made up his mind to go below again, on some excuse, when his
    mate shouted from the top of the shaft:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom! Tom! For Christ&rsquo;s sake come here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom&rsquo;s heart gave a great thump, and he ran like a kangaroo to the
    shaft. All the diggers within hearing were soon on the spot. They saw at
    a glance what had happened. It was madness to sink without timber in such
    treacherous ground. <i>The sides of the shaft were closing in</i>. Tom sprang
    forward and shouted through the crevice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To the face, Jack! To the face, for your life!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old Workings!&rdquo; he cried, turning to the diggers. &ldquo;Bring
    a fan and tools. We&rsquo;ll dig him out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few minutes later a fan was rigged over a deserted shaft close by, where
    fortunately the windlass had been left for bailing purposes, and men were
    down in the old drive. Tom knew that he and his mates had driven very close
    to the old workings.</p>
  <p>He knelt in the damp clay before the face and worked like a madman; he refused
    to take turn about, and only dropped the pick to seize a shovel in his strong
    hands, and snatch back the loose clay from under his feet; he reckoned that
    he had six or, perhaps, eight feet to drive, and he knew that the air could
    not last long in the new drive&mdash;even if that had not already fallen
    in and crushed his brother. Great drops of perspiration stood out on Tom&rsquo;s
    forehead, and his breath began to come in choking sobs, but he still struck
    strong, savage blows into the clay before him, and the drive lengthened quickly.
    Once he paused a moment to listen, and then distinctly heard a sound as of
    a tool or stone being struck against the end of the new drive. Jack was safe!</p>
  <p>Tom dug on until the clay suddenly fell away from his pick and left a hole,
    about the size of a plate, in the &ldquo;face&rdquo; before him. &ldquo;Thank
    God!&rdquo; said a hoarse, strained voice at the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jack!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, old man; you are just in time; I&rsquo;ve hardly got room to
    stand in, and I&rsquo;m nearly smothered.&rdquo; He was crouching against
    the &ldquo;face&rdquo; of the new drive.</p>
  <p>Tom dropped his pick and fell back against the man behind him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, God! my back!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
  <p>Suddenly he struggled to his knees, and then fell forward on his hand and
    dragged himself close to the hole in the end of the drive.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack!&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;Jack!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, old man; what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve hurt my heart, Jack!&mdash;Put your hand&mdash;quick!...
    The sun&rsquo;s going down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack&rsquo;s hand came out through the hole, Tom gripped it, and then fell
    with his face in the damp clay.</p>
  <p>They half carried, half dragged him from the drive, for the roof was low
    and they were obliged to stoop. They took him to the shaft and sent him up,
    lashed to the rope.</p>
  <p>A few blows of the pick, and Jack scrambled from his prison and went to
    the surface, and knelt on the grass by the body of his brother. The diggers
    gathered round and took off their hats. And the sun went down.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheManWhoForgot"></a>The Man Who Forgot</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno,&rdquo; said Tom Marshall&mdash;known as &ldquo;The
    Oracle&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before: they
    ain&rsquo;t commin, but&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heerd o&rsquo; sich cases before,&rdquo; and
    he screwed up the left side of his face whilst he reflectively scraped his
    capacious right ear with the large blade of a pocket-knife.</p>
  <p>They were sitting at the western end of the rouseabouts&rsquo; hut, enjoying
    the breeze that came up when the sun went down, and smoking and yarning.
    The &ldquo;case&rdquo;  in question was a wretchedly forlorn-looking specimen
    of the swag-carrying clan whom a boundary-rider had found wandering about
    the adjacent plain, and had brought into the station. He was a small, scraggy
    man, painfully fair, with a big, baby-like head, vacant watery eyes, long
    thin hairy hands, that felt like pieces of damp seaweed, and an apologetic
    cringe-and-look-up-at-you manner. He professed to have forgotten who he was
    and all about himself.</p>
  <p>The Oracle was deeply interested in this case, as indeed he was in anything
    else that &ldquo;looked curious.&rdquo; He was a big, simple-minded shearer,
    with more heart than brains, more experience than sense, and more curiosity
    than either. It was a wonder that he had not profited, even indirectly, by
    the last characteristic. His heart was filled with a kind of reverential
    pity for anyone who was fortunate or unfortunate enough to possess an &ldquo;affliction;&rdquo; and
    amongst his mates had been counted a deaf man, a blind man, a poet, and a
    man who &ldquo;had rats.&rdquo; Tom had dropped across them individually,
    when they were down in the world, and had befriended them, and studied them
    with great interest&mdash;especially the poet; and they thought kindly of
    him, and were grateful&mdash;except the individual with the rats, who reckoned
    Tom had an axe to grind&mdash;that he, in fact, wanted to cut his (Rat&rsquo;s)
    liver out as a bait for Darling cod&mdash;and so renounced the mateship.</p>
  <p>It was natural, then, for The Oracle to take the present case under his
    wing. He used his influence with the boss to get the Mystery on &ldquo;picking
    up,&rdquo;  and studied him in spare time, and did his best to assist the
    poor hushed memory, which nothing the men could say or do seemed able to
    push further back than the day on which the stranger &ldquo;kind o&rsquo; woke
    up&rdquo; on the plain, and found a swag beside him. The swag had been prospected
    and fossicked for a clue, but yielded none. The chaps were sceptical at first,
    and inclined to make fun of the Mystery; but Tom interfered, and intimated
    that if they were skunks enough to chyack or try on any of their &ldquo;funny
    business&rdquo; with a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; he (Tom) would
    be obliged to &ldquo;perform.&rdquo; Most of the men there had witnessed
    Tom&rsquo;s performance, and no one seemed ambitious to take a leading part
    in it. They preferred to be in the audience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected The Oracle, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a curious case,
    and I dare say some of them big doctors, like Morell Mackenzie, would be
    glad to give a thousand or two to get holt on a case like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; cried Mitchell, the goat of the shed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    go halves!&mdash;or stay, let&rsquo;s form a syndicate and work the Mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some of the rouseabouts laughed, but the joke fell as flat with Tom as any
    other joke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it is,&rdquo; said the Mystery himself, in the whine
    that was natural to him, and with a timid side look up at Tom&mdash;&ldquo;the
    worst of it is I might be a lord or duke, and don&rsquo;t know anything about
    it. I might be a rich man, with a lot of houses and money. I might be a lord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps guffawed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;yer laughing at?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    see anything unreasonable about it; he might be a lord as far as looks go.
    I&rsquo;ve seen two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; reflected Tom, ignoring Mitchell, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    something in that; but then again, you see, you might be Jack the Ripper.
    Better let it slide, mate; let the dead past bury its dead. Start fresh with
    a clean sheet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t even know my name, or whether I&rsquo;m married
    or not,&rdquo; whined the outcast. &ldquo;I might have a good wife and little
    ones.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better keep on forgetting, mate,&rdquo; Mitchell said, &ldquo;and
    as for a name, that&rsquo;s nothing. I don&rsquo;t know mine, and I&rsquo;ve
    had eight. There&rsquo;s plenty good names knocking round. I knew a man named
    Jim Smith that died. Take his name, it just suits you, and he ain&rsquo;t
    likely to call round for it; if he does, you can say you was born with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they called him Smith, and soon began to regard him as a harmless lunatic
    and to take no notice of his eccentricities. Great interest was taken in
    the case for a time, and even Mitchell put in his oar and tried all sorts
    of ways to assist the Mystery in his weak, helpless, and almost pitiful endeavours
    to recollect who he was. A similar case happened to appear in the papers
    at this time, and the thing caught on to such an extent that The Oracle was
    moved to impart some advice from his store of wisdom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t think too much over it if I was you,&rdquo; said
    he to Mitchell,  &ldquo;hundreds of sensible men went mad over that there
    Tichborne case who didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it, but just through
    thinking on it; and you&rsquo;re ratty enough already, Jack. Let it alone
    and trust me to find out who&rsquo;s Smith just as soon as ever we cut out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Smith ate, worked, and slept, and borrowed tobacco and forgot
    to return it&mdash;which was made a note of. He talked freely about his case
    when asked, but if he addressed anyone, it was with the air of the timid
    but good young man, who is fully aware of the extent and power of this world&rsquo;s
    wickedness, and stands somewhat in awe of it, but yet would beg you to favour
    a humble worker in the vineyard by kindly accepting a tract, and passing
    it on to friends after perusal.</p>
  <p>One Saturday morning, about a fortnight before cut out, The Oracle came
    late to his stand, and apparently with something on his mind. Smith hadn&rsquo;t
    turned up, and the next rouseabout was doing his work, to the mutual dissatisfaction
    of all parties immediately concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you see anything of Smith?&rdquo; asked Mitchell of The Oracle. &ldquo;Seems
    to have forgot to get up this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked disheartened and disappointed. <i>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again</i>,&rdquo;  said
    he, slowly and impressively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Forgot what? We know he&rsquo;s blessed well forgot to come to graft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s forgot again,&rdquo; repeated Tom. &ldquo;He woke up this
    morning and wanted to know who he was and where he was.&rdquo; Comments.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better give him best, Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell presently. &ldquo;If
    he can&rsquo;t find out who he is and where he is, the boss&rsquo;ll soon
    find it out for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;when I take a thing in hand I see it
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was also characteristic of the boss-over-the-board, though in another
    direction. He went down to the hut and inquired for Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why ain&rsquo;t you at work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who am I, sir? Where am I?&rdquo; whined Smith. &ldquo;Can you please
    tell me who I am and where I am?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss drew a long breath and stared blankly at the Mystery; then he erupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here!&rdquo; he howled, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know who the
    gory sheol you are, except that you&rsquo;re a gory lunatic, and what&rsquo;s
    more, I don&rsquo;t care a damn. But I&rsquo;ll soon show you where you are!
    You can call up at the store and get your cheque, and soon as you blessed
    well like; and then take a walk, and don&rsquo;t forget to take your lovely
    swag with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The matter was discussed at the dinner-table. The Oracle swore that it was
    a cruel, mean way to treat a &ldquo;pore afflicted chap,&rdquo; and cursed
    the boss. Tom&rsquo;s admirers cursed in sympathy, and trouble seemed threatening,
    when the voice of Mitchell was heard to rise in slow, deliberate tones over
    the clatter of cutlery and tin plates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; said the voice, &ldquo;I wonder whether Smith forgot
    his cheque?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was ascertained that Smith hadn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>There was some eating and thinking done. Soon Mitchell&rsquo;s voice was
    heard again, directed at The Oracle.</p>
  <p>It said &ldquo;Do you keep any vallabels about your bunk, Oracle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom looked hard at Mitchell. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo;: only I think it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea for
    you to look at your bunk and see whether Smith forgot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps grew awfully interested. They fixed their eyes on Tom, and he
    looked with feeling from one face to another; then he pushed his plate back,
    and slowly extracted his long legs from between the stool and the table.
    He climbed to his bunk, and carefully reviewed the ingredients of his swag.
    Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>When The Oracle&rsquo;s face came round again there was in it a strange
    expression which a close study would have revealed to be more of anger than
    of sorrow, but that was not all. It was an expression such as a man might
    wear who is undergoing a terrible operation, without chloroform, but is determined
    not to let a whimper escape him. Tom didn&rsquo;t swear, and by that token
    they guessed how mad he was. &rsquo;Twas a rough shed, with a free and lurid
    vocabulary, but had they all sworn in chorus, with One-eyed Bogan as lead,
    it would not have done justice to Tom&rsquo;s feelings&mdash;and they realized
    this.</p>
  <p>The Oracle took down his bridle from its peg, and started for the door amid
    a respectful and sympathetic silence, which was only partly broken once by
    the voice of Mitchell, which asked in an awed whisper:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going ter ketch yer horse, Tom?&rdquo; The Oracle nodded, and passed
    on; he spake no word&mdash;he was too full for words.</p>
  <p>Five minutes passed, and then the voice of Mitchell was heard again, uninterrupted
    by the clatter of tinware. It said in impressive tones:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It would not be a bad idea for some of you chaps that camp in the
    bunks along there, to have a look at your things. Scotty&rsquo;s bunk is
    next to Tom&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scotty shot out of his place as if a snake had hold of his leg, starting
    a plank in the table and upsetting three soup plates. He reached for his
    bunk like a drowning man clutching at a plank, and tore out the bedding.
    Again, Smith hadn&rsquo;t forgot.</p>
  <p>Then followed a general overhaul, and it was found in most cases that Smith
    had remembered. The pent-up reservoir of blasphemy burst forth.</p>
  <p>The Oracle came up with Smith that night at the nearest shanty, and found
    that he had forgotten again, and in several instances, and was forgetting
    some more under the influence of rum and of the flattering interest taken
    in his case by a drunken Bachelor of Arts who happened to be at the pub.
    Tom came in quietly from the rear, and crooked his finger at the shanty-keeper.
    They went apart from the rest, and talked together a while very earnestly.
    Then they secretly examined Smith&rsquo;s swag, the core of which was composed
    of Tom&rsquo;s and his mate&rsquo;s valuables.</p>
  <p>Then The Oracle stirred up Smith&rsquo;s recollections and departed.</p>
  <p>Smith was about again in a couple of weeks. He was damaged somewhat physically,
    but his memory was no longer impaired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Hungerford"></a>Hungerford</b></h2>
  <p>One of the hungriest cleared roads in New South Wales runs to within a couple
    of miles of Hungerford, and stops there; then you strike through the scrub
    to the town. There is no distant prospect of Hungerford&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
    see the town till you are quite close to it, and then two or three white-washed
    galvanized-iron roofs start out of the mulga.</p>
  <p>They say that a past Ministry commenced to clear the road from Bourke, under
    the impression that Hungerford was an important place, and went on, with
    the blindness peculiar to governments, till they got to within two miles
    of the town. Then they ran short of rum and rations, and sent a man on to
    get them, and make inquiries. The member never came back, and two more were
    sent to find him&mdash;or Hungerford. Three days later the two returned in
    an exhausted condition, and submitted a motion of want-of-confidence, which
    was lost. Then the whole House went on and was lost also. Strange to relate,
    that Government was never missed.</p>
  <p>However, we found Hungerford and camped there for a day. The town is right
    on the Queensland border, and an interprovincial rabbit-proof fence&mdash;with
    rabbits on both sides of it&mdash;runs across the main street.</p>
  <p>This fence is a standing joke with Australian rabbits&mdash;about the only
    joke they have out there, except the memory of Pasteur and poison and inoculation.
    It is amusing to go a little way out of town, about sunset, and watch them
    crack Noah&rsquo;s Ark rabbit jokes about that fence, and burrow under and
    play leap-frog over it till they get tired. One old buck rabbit sat up and
    nearly laughed his ears off at a joke of his own about that fence. He laughed
    so much that he couldn&rsquo;t get away when I reached for him. I could hardly
    eat him for laughing. I never saw a rabbit laugh before; but I&rsquo;ve seen
    a &rsquo;possum do it.</p>
  <p>Hungerford consists of two houses and a humpy in New South Wales, and five
    houses in Queensland. Characteristically enough, both the pubs are in Queensland.
    We got a glass of sour yeast at one and paid sixpence for it&mdash;we had
    asked for English ale.</p>
  <p>The post office is in New South Wales, and the police-barracks in Bananaland.
    The police cannot do anything if there&rsquo;s a row going on across the
    street in New South Wales, except to send to Brisbane and have an extradition
    warrant applied for; and they don&rsquo;t do much if there&rsquo;s a row
    in Queensland. Most of the rows are across the border, where the pubs are.</p>
  <p>At least, I believe that&rsquo;s how it is, though the man who told me might
    have been a liar. Another man said he was a liar, but then <i>he</i> might
    have been a liar himself&mdash;a third person said he was one. I heard that
    there was a fight over it, but the man who told me about the fight might
    not have been telling the truth.</p>
  <p>One part of the town swears at Brisbane when things go wrong, and the other
    part curses Sydney.</p>
  <p>The country looks as though a great ash-heap had been spread out there,
    and mulga scrub and firewood planted&mdash;and neglected. The country looks
    just as bad for a hundred miles round Hungerford, and beyond that it gets
    worse&mdash;a blasted, barren wilderness that doesn&rsquo;t even howl. If
    it howled it would be a relief.</p>
  <p>I believe that Bourke and Wills found Hungerford, and it&rsquo;s a pity
    they did; but, if I ever stand by the graves of the men who first travelled
    through this country, when there were neither roads nor stations, nor tanks,
    nor bores, nor pubs, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take my hat off. There were
    brave men in the land in those days.</p>
  <p>It is said that the explorers gave the district its name chiefly because
    of the hunger they found there, which has remained there ever since. I don&rsquo;t
    know where the &ldquo;ford&rdquo; comes in&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to
    ford, except in flood-time. Hungerthirst would have been better. The town
    is supposed to be situated on the banks of a river called the Paroo, but
    we saw no water there, except what passed for it in a tank. The goats and
    sheep and dogs and the rest of the population drink there. It is dangerous
    to take too much of that water in a raw state.</p>
  <p>Except in flood-time you couldn&rsquo;t find the bed of the river without
    the aid of a spirit-level and a long straight-edge. There is a Custom-house
    against the fence on the northern side. A pound of tea often costs six shillings
    on that side, and you can get a common lead pencil for fourpence at the rival
    store across the street in the mother province. Also, a small loaf of sour
    bread sells for a shilling at the humpy aforementioned. Only about sixty
    per cent of the sugar will melt.</p>
  <p>We saw one of the storekeepers give a dead-beat swagman five shillings&rsquo;  worth
    of rations to take him on into Queensland. The storekeepers often do this,
    and put it down on the loss side of their books. I hope the recording angel
    listens, and puts it down on the right side of his book.</p>
  <p>We camped on the Queensland side of the fence, and after tea had a yarn
    with an old man who was minding a mixed flock of goats and sheep; and we
    asked him whether he thought Queensland was better than New South Wales,
    or the other way about.</p>
  <p>He scratched the back of his head, and thought a while, and hesitated like
    a stranger who is going to do you a favour at some personal inconvenience.</p>
  <p>At last, with the bored air of a man who has gone through the same performance
    too often before, he stepped deliberately up to the fence and spat over it
    into New South Wales. After which he got leisurely through and spat back
    on Queensland.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I think of the blanky colonies!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He gave us time to become sufficiently impressed; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if I was at the Victorian and South Australian border I&rsquo;d
    do the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He let that soak into our minds, and added: &ldquo;And the same with West
    Australia&mdash;and&mdash;and Tasmania.&rdquo; Then he went away.</p>
  <p>The last would have been a long spit&mdash;and he forgot Maoriland.</p>
  <p>We heard afterwards that his name was Clancy and he had that day been offered
    a job droving at &ldquo;twenty-five shillings a week and find your own horse.&rdquo;  Also
    find your own horse feed and tobacco and soap and other luxuries, at station
    prices. Moreover, if you lost your own horse you would have to find another,
    and if that died or went astray you would have to find a third&mdash;or forfeit
    your pay and return on foot. The boss drover agreed to provide flour and
    mutton&mdash;when such things were procurable.</p>
  <p>Consequently, Clancy&rsquo;s unfavourable opinion of the colonies.</p>
  <p>My mate and I sat down on our swags against the fence to talk things over.
    One of us was very deaf. Presently a black tracker went past and looked at
    us, and returned to the pub. Then a trooper in Queensland uniform came along
    and asked us what the trouble was about, and where we came from and were
    going, and where we camped. We said we were discussing private business,
    and he explained that he thought it was a row, and came over to see. Then
    he left us, and later on we saw him sitting with the rest of the population
    on a bench under the hotel veranda. Next morning we rolled up our swags and
    left Hungerford to the north-west.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACampFireYarn"></a>A Camp-Fire Yarn</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;This girl,&rdquo; said Mitchell, continuing a yarn to his mate, &ldquo;was
    about the ugliest girl I ever saw, except one, and I&rsquo;ll tell you about
    her directly. The old man had a carpenter&rsquo;s shop fixed up in a shed
    at the back of his house, and he used to work there pretty often, and sometimes
    I&rsquo;d come over and yarn with him. One day I was sitting on the end of
    the bench, and the old man was working away, and Mary was standing there
    too, all three of us yarning&mdash;she mostly came poking round where I was
    if I happened to be on the premises&mdash;or at least I thought so&mdash;and
    we got yarning about getting married, and the old cove said he&rsquo;d get
    married again if the old woman died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>You</i> get married again!&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Why,
    father, you wouldn&rsquo;t get anyone to marry you&mdash;who&rsquo;d have
    you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I bet I&rsquo;ll get someone
    sooner than you, anyway. You don&rsquo;t seem to be able to get anyone, and
    it&rsquo;s pretty near time you thought of settlin&rsquo; down and gettin&rsquo; married.
    I wish <i>someone</i> would have you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He hit her pretty hard there, but it served her right. She got as
    good as she gave. She looked at me and went all colours, and then she went
    back to her washtub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was mighty quiet at tea-time&mdash;she seemed hurt a lot, and
    I began to feel sorry I&rsquo;d laughed at the old man&rsquo;s joke, for
    she was really a good, hard-working girl, and you couldn&rsquo;t help liking
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So after tea I went out to her in the kitchen, where she was washing
    up, to try and cheer her up a bit. She&rsquo;d scarcely speak at first, except
    to say  &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;No&rsquo;, and kept her face turned away
    from me; and I could see that she&rsquo;d been crying. I began to feel sorry
    for her and mad at the old man, and I started to comfort her. But I didn&rsquo;t
    go the right way to work about it. I told her that she mustn&rsquo;t take
    any notice of the old cove, as he didn&rsquo;t mean half he said. But she
    seemed to take it harder than ever, and at last I got so sorry for her that
    I told her that <i>I&rsquo;d</i> have her if she&rsquo;d have me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did she say?&rdquo; asked Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, after a
    pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said she wouldn&rsquo;t have me at any price!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate laughed, and Mitchell grinned his quiet grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this set me thinking,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;I always
    knew I was a dashed ugly cove, and I began to wonder whether any girl would
    really have me; and I kept on it till at last I made up my mind to find out
    and settle the matter for good&mdash;or bad.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was another farmer&rsquo;s daughter living close by, and I
    met her pretty often coming home from work, and sometimes I had a yarn with
    her. She was plain, and no mistake: Mary was a Venus alongside of her. She
    had feet like a Lascar, and hands about ten sizes too large for her, and
    a face like that camel&mdash;only red; she walked like a camel, too. She
    looked like a ladder with a dress on, and she didn&rsquo;t know a great A
    from a corner cupboard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one evening I met her at the sliprails, and presently I asked
    her, for a joke, if she&rsquo;d marry me. Mind you, I never wanted to marry <i>her</i>;
    I was only curious to know whether any girl would have me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She turned away her face and seemed to hesitate, and I was just turning
    away and beginning to think I was a dashed hopeless case, when all of a sudden
    she fell up against me and said she&rsquo;d be my wife.... And it wasn&rsquo;t
    her fault that she wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do! What didn&rsquo;t she do? Next day she went down to our place
    when I was at work, and hugged and kissed mother and the girls all round,
    and cried, and told mother that she&rsquo;d try and be a dutiful daughter
    to her. Good Lord! You should have seen the old woman and the girls when
    I came home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then she let everyone know that Bridget Page was engaged to Jack
    Mitchell, and told her friends that she went down on her knees every night
    and thanked the Lord for getting the love of a good man. Didn&rsquo;t the
    fellows chyack me, though! My sisters were raving mad about it, for their
    chums kept asking them how they liked their new sister, and when it was going
    to come off, and who&rsquo;d be bridesmaids and best man, and whether they
    weren&rsquo;t surprised at their brother Jack&rsquo;s choice; and then I&rsquo;d
    gammon at home that it was all true.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last the place got too hot for me. I got sick of dodging that
    girl. I sent a mate of mine to tell her that it was all a joke, and that
    I was already married in secret; but she didn&rsquo;t see it, then I cleared,
    and got a job in Newcastle, but had to leave there when my mates sent me
    the office that she was coming. I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder but what she is humping
    her swag after me now. In fact, I thought you was her in disguise when I
    set eyes on you first.... You needn&rsquo;t get mad about it; I don&rsquo;t
    mean to say that you&rsquo;re quite as ugly as she was, because I never saw
    a man that was&mdash;or a woman either. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll never ask a woman
    to marry me again unless I&rsquo;m ready to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Mitchell&rsquo;s mate told a yarn.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I knew a case once something like the one you were telling me about;
    the landlady of a hash-house where I was stopping in Albany told me. There
    was a young carpenter staying there, who&rsquo;d run away from Sydney from
    an old maid who wanted to marry him. He&rsquo;d cleared from the church door,
    I believe. He was scarcely more&rsquo;n a boy&mdash;about nineteen&mdash;and
    a soft kind of a fellow, something like you, only good-looking&mdash;that
    is, he was passable. Well, as soon as the woman found out where he&rsquo;d
    gone, she came after him. She turned up at the boarding-house one Saturday
    morning when Bobbie was at work; and the first thing she did was to rent
    a double room from the landlady and buy some cups and saucers to start housekeeping
    with. When Bobbie came home he just gave her one look and gave up the game.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get your dinner, Bobbie,&rsquo; she said, after she&rsquo;d
    slobbered over him a bit, &lsquo;and then get dressed and come with me and
    get married!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was about three times his age, and had a face like that picture
    of a lady over Sappho Smith&rsquo;s letters in the Sydney <i>Bulletin</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Bobbie went with her like a&mdash;like a lamb; never gave a
    kick or tried to clear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;did you ever shear lambs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind. Let me finish the yarn. Bobbie was married; but she wouldn&rsquo;t
    let him out of her sight all that afternoon, and he had to put up with her
    before them all. About bedtime he sneaked out and started along the passage
    to his room that he shared with two or three mates. But she&rsquo;d her eye
    on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie!&rsquo; she says, &lsquo;Where are you going?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to bed,&rsquo; said Bobbie. &lsquo;Good night!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie,&rsquo; she says, sharply. &lsquo;That isn&rsquo;t
    our room; <i>this</i> is our room, Bobbie. Come back at once! What do you
    mean, Bobbie? <i>Do you hear me, Bobbie?</i>&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So Bobbie came back, and went in with the scarecrow. Next morning
    she was first at the breakfast table, in a dressing-gown and curl papers.
    And when they were all sitting down Bobbie sneaked in, looking awfully sheepish,
    and sidled for his chair at the other end of the table. But she&rsquo;d her
    eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Bobbie, Bobbie!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Come and kiss me,
    Bobbie!&rsquo;&rdquo; And he had to do it in front of them all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I believe she made him a good wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisCountryAfterAll"></a>His Country-After All</b></h2>
  <p>The Blenheim coach was descending into the valley of the Avetere River&mdash;pronounced
    Aveterry&mdash;from the saddle of Taylor&rsquo;s Pass. Across the river to
    the right, the grey slopes and flats stretched away to the distant sea from
    a range of tussock hills. There was no native bush there; but there were
    several groves of imported timber standing wide apart&mdash;sentinel-like&mdash;seeming
    lonely and striking in their isolation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grand country, New Zealand, eh?&rdquo; said a stout man with a brown
    face, grey beard, and grey eyes, who sat between the driver and another passenger
    on the box.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t call this grand country!&rdquo; exclaimed the other
    passenger, who claimed to be, and looked like, a commercial traveller, and
    might have been a professional spieler&mdash;quite possibly both. &ldquo;Why,
    it&rsquo;s about the poorest country in New Zealand! You ought to see some
    of the country in the North Island&mdash;Wairarapa and Napier districts,
    round about Pahiatua. I call this damn poor country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I reckon you wouldn&rsquo;t, if you&rsquo;d ever been in Australia&mdash;back
    in New South Wales. The people here don&rsquo;t seem to know what a grand
    country they&rsquo;ve got. You say this is the worst, eh? Well, this would
    make an Australian cockatoo&rsquo;s mouth water&mdash;the worst of New Zealand
    would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought Australia was all good country,&rdquo; mused the
    driver&mdash;a flax-stick. &ldquo;I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good country!&rdquo; exclaimed the man with the grey beard, in a
    tone of disgust. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s only a mongrel desert, except some
    bits round the coast. The worst dried-up and God-forsaken country I was ever
    in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a silence, thoughtful on the driver&rsquo;s part, and aggressive
    on that of the stranger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I always thought,&rdquo; said the driver, reflectively, after the
    pause&mdash;&ldquo;I always thought Australia was a good country,&rdquo; and
    he placed his foot on the brake.</p>
  <p>They let him think. The coach descended the natural terraces above the river
    bank, and pulled up at the pub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re a native of Australia?&rdquo; said the bagman to
    the grey-beard, as the coach went on again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I am. Anyway, I was born there. That&rsquo;s the
    main thing I&rsquo;ve got against the darned country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long did you stay there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Till I got away,&rdquo; said the stranger. Then, after a think, he
    added,  &ldquo;I went away first when I was thirty-five&mdash;went to the
    islands. I swore I&rsquo;d never go back to Australia again; but I did. I
    thought I had a kind of affection for old Sydney. I knocked about the blasted
    country for five or six years, and then I cleared out to &rsquo;Frisco. I
    swore I&rsquo;d never go back again, and I never will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But surely you&rsquo;ll take a run over and have a look at old Sydney
    and those places, before you go back to America, after getting so near?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the blazes do I want to have a look at the blamed country for?&rdquo;  snapped
    the stranger, who had refreshed considerably. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing
    to thank Australia for&mdash;except getting out of it. It&rsquo;s the best
    country to get out of that I was ever in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, well, I only thought you might have had some friends over there,&rdquo;  interposed
    the traveller in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Friends! That&rsquo;s another reason. I wouldn&rsquo;t go back there
    for all the friends and relations since Adam. I had more than quite enough
    of it while I was there. The worst and hardest years of my life were spent
    in Australia. I might have starved there, and did do it half my time. I worked
    harder and got less in my own country in five years than I ever did in any
    other in fifteen&rdquo;&mdash;he was getting mixed&mdash;&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ve
    been in a few since then. No, Australia is the worst country that ever the
    Lord had the sense to forget. I mean to stick to the country that stuck to
    me, when I was starved out of my own dear native land&mdash;and that country
    is the United States of America. What&rsquo;s Australia? A big, thirsty,
    hungry wilderness, with one or two cities for the convenience of foreign
    speculators, and a few collections of humpies, called towns&mdash;also for
    the convenience of foreign speculators; and populated mostly by mongrel sheep,
    and partly by fools, who live like European slaves in the towns, and like
    dingoes in the bush&mdash;who drivel about &lsquo;democracy,&rsquo; and yet
    haven&rsquo;t any more spunk than to graft for a few Cockney dudes that razzle-dazzle
    most of the time in Paris. Why, the Australians haven&rsquo;t even got the
    grit to claim enough of their own money to throw a few dams across their
    watercourses, and so make some of the interior fit to live in. America&rsquo;s
    bad enough, but it was never so small as that.... Bah! The curse of Australia
    is sheep, and the Australian war cry is Baa!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the first man I ever heard talk as you&rsquo;ve
    been doing about his own country,&rdquo; said the bagman, getting tired and
    impatient of being sat on all the time. &ldquo;&lsquo;Lives there a man with
    a soul so dead, who never said&mdash;to&mdash;to himself&rsquo;... I forget
    the darned thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He tried to remember it. The man whose soul was dead cleared his throat
    for action, and the driver&mdash;for whom the bagman had shouted twice as
    against the stranger&rsquo;s once&mdash;took the opportunity to observe that
    he always thought a man ought to stick up for his own country.</p>
  <p>The stranger ignored him and opened fire on the bagman. He proceeded to
    prove that that was all rot&mdash;that patriotism was the greatest curse
    on earth; that it had been the cause of all war; that it was the false, ignorant
    sentiment which moved men to slave, starve, and fight for the comfort of
    their sluggish masters; that it was the enemy of universal brotherhood, the
    mother of hatred, murder, and slavery, and that the world would never be
    any better until the deadly poison, called the sentiment of patriotism, had
    been &ldquo;educated&rdquo; out of the stomachs of the people.  &ldquo;Patriotism!&rdquo; he
    exclaimed scornfully. &ldquo;My country! The darned fools; the country never
    belonged to them, but to the speculators, the absentees, land-boomers, swindlers,
    gangs of thieves&mdash;the men the patriotic fools starve and fight for&mdash;their
    masters. Ba-a!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The opposition collapsed.</p>
  <p>The coach had climbed the terraces on the south side of the river, and was
    bowling along on a level stretch of road across the elevated flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What trees are those?&rdquo; asked the stranger, breaking the aggressive
    silence which followed his unpatriotic argument, and pointing to a grove
    ahead by the roadside. &ldquo;They look as if they&rsquo;ve been planted
    there. There ain&rsquo;t been a forest here surely?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re some trees the Government imported,&rdquo; said
    the bagman, whose knowledge on the subject was limited. &ldquo;Our own bush
    won&rsquo;t grow in this soil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it looks as if anything else would&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the stranger sniffed once by accident, and then several times with
    interest.</p>
  <p>It was a warm morning after rain. He fixed his eyes on those trees.</p>
  <p>They didn&rsquo;t look like Australian gums; they tapered to the tops, the
    branches were pretty regular, and the boughs hung in shipshape fashion. There
    was not the Australian heat to twist the branches and turn the leaves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; exclaimed the stranger, still staring and sniffing hard. &ldquo;Why,
    dang me if they ain&rsquo;t (sniff) Australian gums!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver, flicking his horses, &ldquo;they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanky (sniff) blanky old Australian gums!&rdquo; exclaimed the ex-Australian,
    with strange enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not old,&rdquo; said the driver; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re
    only young trees. But they say they don&rsquo;t grow like that in Australia&mdash;&rsquo;count
    of the difference in the climate. I always thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other did not appear to hear him; he kept staring hard at the trees
    they were passing. They had been planted in rows and cross-rows, and were
    coming on grandly.</p>
  <p>There was a rabbit trapper&rsquo;s camp amongst those trees; he had made
    a fire to boil his billy with gum-leaves and twigs, and it was the scent
    of that fire which interested the exile&rsquo;s nose, and brought a wave
    of memories with it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; he shouted suddenly to the rabbit trapper,
    and to the astonishment of his fellow passengers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate!&rdquo; The answer came back like an echo&mdash;it
    seemed to him&mdash;from the past.</p>
  <p>Presently he caught sight of a few trees which had evidently been planted
    before the others&mdash;as an experiment, perhaps&mdash;and, somehow, one
    of them had grown after its own erratic native fashion&mdash;gnarled and
    twisted and ragged, and could not be mistaken for anything else but an Australian
    gum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A thunderin&rsquo; old blue-gum!&rdquo; ejaculated the traveller,
    regarding the tree with great interest.</p>
  <p>He screwed his neck to get a last glimpse, and then sat silently smoking
    and gazing straight ahead, as if the past lay before him&mdash;and it <i>was</i> before
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he said, in explanation of a long meditative silence
    on his part; &ldquo;ah, well&mdash;them saplings&mdash;the smell of them
    gum-leaves set me thinking.&rdquo;  And he thought some more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, for my part,&rdquo; said a tourist in the coach, presently,
    in a condescending tone, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see much in Australia. The
    bally colonies are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that be damned!&rdquo; snarled the Australian-born&mdash;they
    had finished the second flask of whisky. &ldquo;What do you Britishers know
    about Australia? She&rsquo;s as good as England, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose you&rsquo;ll go straight back to the States as soon
    as you&rsquo;ve done your business in Christchurch,&rdquo; said the bagman,
    when near their journey&rsquo;s end they had become confidential.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I dunno. I reckon I&rsquo;ll just take a run over to Australia
    first. There&rsquo;s an old mate of mine in business in Sydney, and I&rsquo;d
    like to have a yarn with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADayOnASelection"></a>A Day On A Selection</b></h2>
  <p>The scene is a small New South Wales western selection, the holder whereof
    is native-English. His wife is native-Irish. Time, Sunday, about 8 a.m. A
    used-up looking woman comes from the slab-and-bark house, turns her face
    towards the hillside, and shrieks:</p>

  <p>No response, and presently she draws a long breath and screams again:</p>

  <p>A faint echo comes from far up the siding where Tommy&rsquo;s presence is
    vaguely indicated by half a dozen cows moving slowly&mdash;very slowly&mdash;down
    towards the cow-yard.</p>
  <p>The woman retires. Ten minutes later she comes out again and screams:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tom</i>my!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-e-e-a-a-s-s!&rdquo; very passionately and shrilly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you goin&rsquo; to bring those cows down to-day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y-e-e-a-a-s-s-s!&mdash;carn&rsquo;t yer see I&rsquo;m comin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A boy is seen to run wildly along the siding and hurl a missile at a feeding
    cow; the cow runs forward a short distance through the trees, and then stops
    to graze again while the boy stirs up another milker.</p>
  <p>An hour goes by.</p>
  <p>The rising Australian generation is represented by a thin, lanky youth of
    about fifteen. He is milking. The cow-yard is next the house, and is mostly
    ankle-deep in slush. The boy drives a dusty, discouraged-looking cow into
    the bail, and pins her head there; then he gets tackle on to her right hind
    leg, hauls it back, and makes it fast to the fence. There are eleven cows,
    but not one of them can be milked out of the bail&mdash;chiefly because their
    teats are sore. The selector does not know what makes the teats sore, but
    he has an unquestioning faith in a certain ointment, recommended to him by
    a man who knows less about cows than he does himself, which he causes to
    be applied at irregular intervals&mdash;leaving the mode of application to
    the discretion of his son. Meanwhile the teats remain sore.</p>
  <p>Having made the cow fast, the youngster cautiously takes hold of the least
    sore teat, yanks it suddenly, and dodges the cow&rsquo;s hock. When he gets
    enough milk to dip his dirty hands in, he moistens the teats, and things
    go on more smoothly. Now and then he relieves the monotony of his occupation
    by squirting at the eye of a calf which is dozing in the adjacent pen. Other
    times he milks into his mouth. Every time the cow kicks, a burr or a grass-seed
    or a bit of something else falls into the milk, and the boy drowns these
    things with a well-directed stream&mdash;on the principle that what&rsquo;s
    out of sight is out of mind.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the boy sticks his head into the cow&rsquo;s side, hangs on by
    a teat, and dozes, while the bucket, mechanically gripped between his knees,
    sinks lower and lower till it rests on the ground. Likely as not he&rsquo;ll
    doze on until his mother&rsquo;s shrill voice startles him with an inquiry
    as to whether he intends to get that milking done to-day; other times he
    is roused by the plunging of the cow, or knocked over by a calf which has
    broken through a defective panel in the pen. In the latter case the youth
    gets tackle on to the calf, detaches its head from the teat with the heel
    of his boot, and makes it fast somewhere. Sometimes the cow breaks or loosens
    the leg-rope and gets her leg into the bucket and then the youth clings desperately
    to the pail and hopes she&rsquo;ll get her hoof out again without spilling
    the milk. Sometimes she does, more often she doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;it depends
    on the strength of the boy and the pail and on the strategy of the former.
    Anyway, the boy will lam the cow down with a jagged yard shovel, let her
    out, and bail up another.</p>
  <p>When he considers that he has finished milking he lets the cows out with
    their calves and carries the milk down to the dairy, where he has a heated
    argument with his mother, who&mdash;judging from the quantity of milk&mdash;has
    reason to believe that he has slummed some of the milkers. This he indignantly
    denies, telling her she knows very well the cows are going dry.</p>
  <p>The dairy is built of rotten box bark&mdash;though there is plenty of good
    stringy-bark within easy distance&mdash;and the structure looks as if it
    wants to lie down and is only prevented by three crooked props on the leaning
    side; more props will soon be needed in the rear for the dairy shows signs
    of going in that direction. The milk is set in dishes made of kerosene-tins,
    cut in halves, which are placed on bark shelves fitted round against the
    walls. The shelves are not level and the dishes are brought to a comparatively
    horizontal position by means of chips and bits of bark, inserted under the
    lower side. The milk is covered by soiled sheets of old newspapers supported
    on sticks laid across the dishes. This protection is necessary, because the
    box bark in the roof has crumbled away and left fringed holes&mdash;also
    because the fowls roost up there. Sometimes the paper sags, and the cream
    may have to be scraped off an article on dairy farming.</p>
  <p>The selector&rsquo;s wife removes the newspapers, and reveals a thick, yellow
    layer of rich cream, plentifully peppered with dust that has drifted in somehow.
    She runs a forefinger round the edges of the cream to detach it from the
    tin, wipes her finger in her mouth, and skims. If the milk and cream are
    very thick she rolls the cream over like a pancake with her fingers, and
    lifts it out in sections. The thick milk is poured into a slop-bucket, for
    the pigs and calves, the dishes are  &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo;&mdash;by the aid
    of a dipper full of warm water and a rag&mdash;and the wife proceeds to set
    the morning&rsquo;s milk. Tom holds up the doubtful-looking rag that serves
    as a strainer while his mother pours in the milk. Sometimes the boy&rsquo;s
    hands get tired and he lets some of the milk run over, and gets into trouble;
    but it doesn&rsquo;t matter much, for the straining-cloth has several sizable
    holes in the middle.</p>
  <p>The door of the dairy faces the dusty road and is off its hinges and has
    to be propped up. The prop is missing this morning, and Tommy is accused
    of having been seen chasing old Poley with it at an earlier hour. He never
    seed the damn prop, never chased no cow with it, and wants to know what&rsquo;s
    the use of always accusing him. He further complains that he&rsquo;s always
    blamed for everything. The pole is not forthcoming, and so an old dray is
    backed against the door to keep it in position. There is more trouble about
    a cow that is lost, and hasn&rsquo;t been milked for two days. The boy takes
    the cows up to the paddock sliprails and lets the top rail down: the lower
    rail fits rather tightly and some exertion is required to free it, so he
    makes the animals jump that one. Then he &ldquo;poddies&ldquo;&mdash;hand-feeds&mdash;the
    calves which have been weaned too early. He carries the skim-milk to the
    yard in a bucket made out of an oil-drum&mdash;sometimes a kerosene-tin&mdash;seizes
    a calf by the nape of the neck with his left hand, inserts the dirty forefinger
    of his right into its mouth, and shoves its head down into the milk. The
    calf sucks, thinking it has a teat, and pretty soon it butts violently&mdash;as
    calves do to remind their mothers to let down the milk&mdash;and the boy&rsquo;s
    wrist gets barked against the jagged edge of the bucket. He welts that calf
    in the jaw, kicks it in the stomach, tries to smother it with its nose in
    the milk, and finally dismisses it with the assistance of the calf rope and
    a shovel, and gets another. His hand feels sticky and the cleaned finger
    makes it look as if he wore a filthy, greasy glove with the forefinger torn
    off.</p>
  <p>The selector himself is standing against a fence talking to a neighbour.
    His arms rest on the top rail of the fence, his chin rests on his hands,
    his pipe rests between his fingers, and his eyes rest on a white cow that
    is chewing her cud on the opposite side of the fence. The neighbour&rsquo;s
    arms rest on the top rail also, his chin rests on his hands, his pipe rests
    between his fingers, and his eyes rest on the cow. They are talking about
    that cow. They have been talking about her for three hours. She is chewing
    her cud. Her nose is well up and forward, and her eyes are shut. She lets
    her lower jaw fall a little, moves it to one side, lifts it again, and brings
    it back into position with a springing kind of jerk that has almost a visible
    recoil. Then her jaws stay perfectly still for a moment, and you would think
    she had stopped chewing. But she hasn&rsquo;t. Now and again a soft, easy,
    smooth-going swallow passes visibly along her clean, white throat and disappears.
    She chews again, and by and by she loses consciousness and forgets to chew.
    She never opens her eyes. She is young and in good condition; she has had
    enough to eat, the sun is just properly warm for her, and&mdash;well, if
    an animal can be really happy, she ought to be.</p>
  <p>Presently the two men drag themselves away from the fence, fill their pipes,
    and go to have a look at some rows of forked sticks, apparently stuck in
    the ground for some purpose. The selector calls these sticks fruit-trees,
    and he calls the place &ldquo;the orchard.&rdquo; They fool round these wretched
    sticks until dinnertime, when the neighbour says he must be getting home. &ldquo;Stay
    and have some dinner! Man alive! Stay and have some dinner!&rdquo; says the
    selector; and so the friend stays.</p>
  <p>It is a broiling hot day in summer, and the dinner consists of hot roast
    meat, hot baked potatoes, hot cabbage, hot pumpkin, hot peas, and burning-hot
    plum-pudding. The family drinks on an average four cups of tea each per meal.
    The wife takes her place at the head of the table with a broom to keep the
    fowls out, and at short intervals she interrupts the conversation with such
    exclamations as  &ldquo;Shoo! shoo!&rdquo; &ldquo;Tommy, can&rsquo;t you
    see that fowl? Drive it out!&rdquo; The fowls evidently pass a lot of their
    time in the house. They mark the circle described by the broom, and take
    care to keep two or three inches beyond it. Every now and then you see a
    fowl on the dresser amongst the crockery, and there is great concern to get
    it out before it breaks something. While dinner is in progress two steers
    get into the wheat through a broken rail which has been spliced with stringy-bark,
    and a calf or two break into the vineyard. And yet this careless Australian
    selector, who is too shiftless to put up a decent fence, or build a decent
    house and who knows little or nothing about farming, would seem by his conversation
    to have read up all the great social and political questions of the day.
    Here are some fragments of conversation caught at the dinner-table. Present&mdash;the
    selector, the missus, the neighbour, Corney George&mdash;nicknamed &ldquo;Henry
    George&rdquo;&mdash;Tommy, Jacky, and the younger children. The spaces represent
    interruptions by the fowls and children:</p>
  <p>Corney George (continuing conversation): &ldquo;But Henry George says, in  &lsquo;Progress
    and Poverty,&rsquo; he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;He says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom: &ldquo;Marther, jist speak to this Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to Jack): &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t behave yourself, leave the table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom [Corney, probably]: &ldquo;He says in Progress and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neighbour: &ldquo;I think &lsquo;Lookin&rsquo; Backwards&rsquo; is more&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo! Tom, can&rsquo;t you see that fowl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Now I think &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Column&rsquo; is more
    likely&mdash;Just look at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Just look at the French Revolution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;Now, Henry George&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom: &ldquo;Marther! I seen a old-man kangaroo up on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shut up! Eat your dinner an&rsquo; hold your tongue. Carn&rsquo;t
    you see someone&rsquo;s speakin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;Just look at the French&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; (turning suddenly and unexpectedly
    on Jacky): &ldquo;Take your fingers out of the sugar!&mdash;Blast yer! that
    I should say such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Neighbour: &ldquo;But &lsquo;Lookin&rsquo; Backwards&rsquo; is more&mdash;&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;There you go, Tom! Didn&rsquo;t I say you&rsquo;d spill that
    tea? Go away from the table!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;I think &lsquo;Caesar&rsquo;s Column&rsquo; is the only
    natural&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo; She loses patience, gets up and fetches
    a young rooster with the flat of the broom, sending him flying into the yard;
    he falls with his head towards the door and starts in again. Later on the
    conversation is about Deeming.</p>
  <p>Selector: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt the man&rsquo;s mad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus: &ldquo;Deeming! That Windsor wretch! Why, if I was in the law I&rsquo;d
    have him boiled alive! Don&rsquo;t tell me he didn&rsquo;t know what he was
    doing! Why, I&rsquo;d have him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Corney: &ldquo;But, missus, you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Missus (to the fowls): &ldquo;Shoo! Shoo!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThatThereDogOMine"></a>That There Dog O&rsquo; Mine</b></h2>
  <p>Macquarie the shearer had met with an accident. To tell the truth, he had
    been in a drunken row at a wayside shanty, from which he had escaped with
    three fractured ribs, a cracked head, and various minor abrasions. His dog,
    Tally, had been a sober but savage participator in the drunken row, and had
    escaped with a broken leg. Macquarie afterwards shouldered his swag and staggered
    and struggled along the track ten miles to the Union Town hospital. Lord
    knows how he did it. He didn&rsquo;t exactly know himself. Tally limped behind
    all the way, on three legs.</p>
  <p>The doctors examined the man&rsquo;s injuries and were surprised at his
    endurance. Even doctors are surprised sometimes&mdash;though they don&rsquo;t
    always show it. Of course they would take him in, but they objected to Tally.
    Dogs were not allowed on the premises.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You will have to turn that dog out,&rdquo; they said to the shearer,
    as he sat on the edge of a bed.</p>
  <p>Macquarie said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We cannot allow dogs about the place, my man,&rdquo; said the doctor
    in a louder tone, thinking the man was deaf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tie him up in the yard then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He must go out. Dogs are not permitted on the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Macquarie rose slowly to his feet, shut his agony behind his set teeth,
    painfully buttoned his shirt over his hairy chest, took up his waistcoat,
    and staggered to the corner where the swag lay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t going to let my dog stop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s against the rules. There are no dogs allowed on premises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stooped and lifted his swag, but the pain was too great, and he leaned
    back against the wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come, come now! man alive!&rdquo; exclaimed the doctor, impatiently. &ldquo;You
    must be mad. You know you are not in a fit state to go out. Let the wardsman
    help you to undress.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said Macquarie. &ldquo;No. If you won&rsquo;t take my
    dog in you don&rsquo;t take me. He&rsquo;s got a broken leg and wants fixing
    up just&mdash;just as much as&mdash;as I do. If I&rsquo;m good enough to
    come in, he&rsquo;s good enough&mdash;and&mdash;and better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused awhile, breathing painfully, and then went on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that there old dog of mine has follered me faithful and
    true, these twelve long hard and hungry years. He&rsquo;s about&mdash;about
    the only thing that ever cared whether I lived or fell and rotted on the
    cursed track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested again; then he continued: &ldquo;That&mdash;that there dog was
    pupped on the track,&rdquo; he said, with a sad sort of a smile. &ldquo;I
    carried him for months in a billy, and afterwards on my swag when he knocked
    up.... And the old slut&mdash;his mother&mdash;she&rsquo;d foller along quite
    contented&mdash;and sniff the billy now and again&mdash;just to see if he
    was all right.... She follered me for God knows how many years. She follered
    me till she was blind&mdash;and for a year after. She follered me till she
    could crawl along through the dust no longer, and&mdash;and then I killed
    her, because I couldn&rsquo;t leave her behind alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And this here old dog,&rdquo; he continued, touching Tally&rsquo;s
    upturned nose with his knotted fingers, &ldquo;this here old dog has follered
    me for&mdash;for ten years; through floods and droughts, through fair times
    and&mdash;and hard&mdash;mostly hard; and kept me from going mad when I had
    no mate nor money on the lonely track; and watched over me for weeks when
    I was drunk&mdash;drugged and poisoned at the cursed shanties; and saved
    my life more&rsquo;n once, and got kicks and curses very often for thanks;
    and forgave me for it all; and&mdash;and fought for me. He was the only living
    thing that stood up for me against that crawling push of curs when they set
    onter me at the shanty back yonder&mdash;and he left his mark on some of &rsquo;em
    too; and&mdash;and so did I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took another spell.</p>
  <p>Then he drew in his breath, shut his teeth hard, shouldered his swag, stepped
    into the doorway, and faced round again.</p>
  <p>The dog limped out of the corner and looked up anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That there dog,&rdquo; said Macquarie to the hospital staff in general,  &ldquo;is
    a better dog than I&rsquo;m a man&mdash;or you too, it seems&mdash;and a
    better Christian. He&rsquo;s been a better mate to me than I ever was to
    any man&mdash;or any man to me. He&rsquo;s watched over me; kep&rsquo; me
    from getting robbed many a time; fought for me; saved my life and took drunken
    kicks and curses for thanks&mdash;and forgave me. He&rsquo;s been a true,
    straight, honest, and faithful mate to me&mdash;and I ain&rsquo;t going to
    desert him now. I ain&rsquo;t going to kick him out in the road with a broken
    leg. I&mdash;Oh, my God! my back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He groaned and lurched forward, but they caught him, slipped off the swag,
    and laid him on a bed.</p>
  <p>Half an hour later the shearer was comfortably fixed up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my dog!&rdquo; he asked, when he came to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the dog&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the nurse, rather impatiently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    bother. The doctor&rsquo;s setting his leg out in the yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="GoingBlind"></a>Going Blind</b></h2>
  <p>I met him in the Full-and-Plenty Dining Rooms. It was a cheap place in the
    city, with good beds upstairs let at one shilling per night&mdash;&ldquo;Board
    and residence for respectable single men, fifteen shillings per week.&rdquo; I
    was a respectable single man then. I boarded and resided there. I boarded
    at a greasy little table in the greasy little corner under the fluffy little
    staircase in the hot and greasy little dining-room or restaurant downstairs.
    They called it dining-rooms, but it was only one room, and them wasn&rsquo;t
    half enough room in it to work your elbows when the seven little tables and
    forty-nine chairs were occupied. There was not room for an ordinary-sized
    steward to pass up and down between the tables; but our waiter was not an
    ordinary-sized man&mdash;he was a living skeleton in miniature. We handed
    the soup, and the &ldquo;roast beef one,&rdquo; and &ldquo;roast lamb one,&rdquo; &ldquo;corn
    beef and cabbage one,&rdquo; &ldquo;veal and stuffing one,&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;veal
    and pickled pork,&rdquo; one&mdash;or two, or three, as the case might be&mdash;and
    the tea and coffee, and the various kinds of puddings&mdash;we handed them
    over each other, and dodged the drops as well as we could. The very hot and
    very greasy little kitchen was adjacent, and it contained the bathroom and
    other conveniences, behind screens of whitewashed boards.</p>
  <p>I resided upstairs in a room where there were five beds and one wash-stand;
    one candle-stick, with a very short bit of soft yellow candle in it; the
    back of a hair-brush, with about a dozen bristles in it; and half a comb&mdash;the
    big-tooth end&mdash;with nine and a half teeth at irregular distances apart.</p>
  <p>He was a typical bushman, not one of those tall, straight, wiry, brown men
    of the West, but from the old Selection Districts, where many drovers came
    from, and of the old bush school; one of those slight active little fellows
    whom we used to see in cabbage-tree hats, Crimean shirts, strapped trousers,
    and elastic-side boots&mdash;&ldquo;larstins,&rdquo; they called them. They
    could dance well; sing indifferently, and mostly through their noses, the
    old bush songs; play the concertina horribly; and ride like&mdash;like&mdash;well,
    they <i>could</i> ride.</p>
  <p>He seemed as if he had forgotten to grow old and die out with this old colonial
    school to which he belonged. They <i>had</i> careless and forgetful ways
    about them. His name was Jack Gunther, he said, and he&rsquo;d come to Sydney
    to try to get something done to his eyes. He had a portmanteau, a carpet
    bag, some things in a three-bushel bag, and a tin bog. I sat beside him on
    his bed, and struck up an acquaintance, and he told me all about it. First
    he asked me would I mind shifting round to the other side, as he was rather
    deaf in that ear. He&rsquo;d been kicked by a horse, he said, and had been
    a little dull o&rsquo; hearing on that side ever since.</p>
  <p>He was as good as blind. &ldquo;I can see the people near me,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t make out their faces. I can just make out
    the pavement and the houses close at hand, and all the rest is a sort of
    white blur.&rdquo; He looked up: &ldquo;That ceiling is a kind of white,
    ain&rsquo;t it? And this,&rdquo; tapping the wall and putting his nose close
    to it, &ldquo;is a sort of green, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The ceiling might
    have been whiter. The prevalent tints of the wall-paper had originally been
    blue and red, but it was mostly green enough now&mdash;a damp, rotten green;
    but I was ready to swear that the ceiling was snow and that the walls were
    as green as grass if it would have made him feel more comfortable. His sight
    began to get bad about six years before, he said; he didn&rsquo;t take much
    notice of it at first, and then he saw a quack, who made his eyes worse.
    He had already the manner of the blind&mdash;the touch of every finger, and
    even the gentleness in his speech. He had a boy down with him&mdash;a &ldquo;sorter
    cousin of his,&rdquo; and the boy saw him round. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
    be sending that youngster back,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll
    send him home next week. He&rsquo;ll be picking up and learning too much
    down here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I happened to know the district he came from, and we would sit by the hour
    and talk about the country, and chaps by the name of this and chaps by the
    name of that&mdash;drovers mostly, whom we had met or had heard of. He asked
    me if I&rsquo;d ever heard of a chap by the name of Joe Scott&mdash;a big
    sandy-complexioned chap, who might be droving; he was his brother, or, at
    least, his half-brother, but he hadn&rsquo;t heard of him for years; he&rsquo;d
    last heard of him at Blackall, in Queensland; he might have gone overland
    to Western Australia with Tyson&rsquo;s cattle to the new country.</p>
  <p>We talked about grubbing and fencing and digging and droving and shearing&mdash;all
    about the bush&mdash;and it all came back to me as we talked. &ldquo;I can
    see it all now,&rdquo;  he said once, in an abstracted tone, seeming to fix
    his helpless eyes on the wall opposite. But he didn&rsquo;t see the dirty
    blind wall, nor the dingy window, nor the skimpy little bed, nor the greasy
    wash-stand; he saw the dark blue ridges in the sunlight, the grassy sidings
    and flats, the creek with clumps of she-oak here and there, the course of
    the willow-fringed river below, the distant peaks and ranges fading away
    into a lighter azure, the granite ridge in the middle distance, and the rocky
    rises, the stringy-bark and the apple-tree flats, the scrubs, and the sunlit
    plains&mdash;and all. I could see it, too&mdash;plainer than ever I did.</p>
  <p>He had done a bit of fencing in his time, and we got talking about timber.
    He didn&rsquo;t believe in having fencing-posts with big butts; he reckoned
    it was a mistake. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the top of the butt
    catches the rain water and makes the post rot quicker. I&rsquo;d back posts
    without any butt at all to last as long or longer than posts with &rsquo;em&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    if the fence is well put up and well rammed.&rdquo;  He had supplied fencing
    stuff, and fenced by contract, and&mdash;well, you can get more posts without
    butts out of a tree than posts with them. He also objected to charring the
    butts. He said it only made more work&mdash;and wasted time&mdash;the butts
    lasted longer without being charred.</p>
  <p>I asked him if he&rsquo;d ever got stringy-bark palings or shingles out
    of mountain ash, and he smiled a smile that did my heart good to see, and
    said he had. He had also got them out of various other kinds of trees.</p>
  <p>We talked about soil and grass, and gold-digging, and many other things
    which came back to one like a revelation as we yarned.</p>
  <p>He had been to the hospital several times. &ldquo;The doctors don&rsquo;t
    say they can cure me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;they say they might, be able
    to improve my sight and hearing, but it would take a long time&mdash;anyway,
    the treatment would improve my general health. They know what&rsquo;s the
    matter with my eyes,&rdquo; and he explained it as well as he could.  &ldquo;I
    wish I&rsquo;d seen a good doctor when my eyes first began to get weak; but
    young chaps are always careless over things. It&rsquo;s harder to get cured
    of anything when you&rsquo;re done growing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was always hopeful and cheerful. &ldquo;If the worst comes to the worst,&rdquo;  he
    said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s things I can do where I come from. I might do
    a bit o&rsquo; wool-sorting, for instance. I&rsquo;m a pretty fair expert.
    Or else when they&rsquo;re weeding out I could help. I&rsquo;d just have
    to sit down and they&rsquo;d bring the sheep to me, and I&rsquo;d feel the
    wool and tell them what it was&mdash;being blind improves the feeling, you
    know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He had a packet of portraits, but he couldn&rsquo;t make them out very well
    now. They were sort of blurred to him, but I described them and he told me
    who they were. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a girl o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo; he said,
    with reference to one&mdash;a jolly, good-looking bush girl. &ldquo;I got
    a letter from her yesterday. I managed to scribble something, but I&rsquo;ll
    get you, if you don&rsquo;t mind, to write something more I want to put in
    on another piece of paper, and address an envelope for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Darkness fell quickly upon him now&mdash;or, rather, the &ldquo;sort of
    white blur&rdquo;  increased and closed in. But his hearing was better, he
    said, and he was glad of that and still cheerful. I thought it natural that
    his hearing should improve as he went blind.</p>
  <p>One day he said that he did not think he would bother going to the hospital
    any more. He reckoned he&rsquo;d get back to where he was known. He&rsquo;d
    stayed down too long already, and the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; wouldn&rsquo;t
    stand it. He was expecting a letter that didn&rsquo;t come. I was away for
    a couple of days, and when I came back he had been shifted out of the room
    and had a bed in an angle of the landing on top of the staircase, with the
    people brushing against him and stumbling over his things all day on their
    way up and down. I felt indignant, thinking that&mdash;the house being full&mdash;the
    boss had taken advantage of the bushman&rsquo;s helplessness and good nature
    to put him there. But he said that he was quite comfortable. &ldquo;I can
    get a whiff of air here,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Going in next day I thought for a moment that I had dropped suddenly back
    into the past and into a bush dance, for there was a concertina going upstairs.
    He was sitting on the bed, with his legs crossed, and a new cheap concertina
    on his knee, and his eyes turned to the patch of ceiling as if it were a
    piece of music and he could read it. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trying to knock a few
    tunes into my head,&rdquo; he said, with a brave smile, &ldquo;in case the
    worst comes to the worst.&rdquo; He tried to be cheerful, but seemed worried
    and anxious. The letter hadn&rsquo;t come. I thought of the many blind musicians
    in Sydney, and I thought of the bushman&rsquo;s chance, standing at a corner
    swanking a cheap concertina, and I felt sorry for him.</p>
  <p>I went out with a vague idea of seeing someone about the matter, and getting
    something done for the bushman&mdash;of bringing a little influence to his
    assistance; but I suddenly remembered that my clothes were worn out, my hat
    in a shocking state, my boots burst, and that I owed for a week&rsquo;s board
    and lodging, and was likely to be thrown out at any moment myself; and so
    I was not in a position to go where there was influence.</p>
  <p>When I went back to the restaurant there was a long, gaunt sandy-complexioned
    bushman sitting by Jack&rsquo;s side. Jack introduced him as his brother,
    who had returned unexpectedly to his native district, and had followed him
    to Sydney. The brother was rather short with me at first, and seemed to regard
    the restaurant people&mdash;all of us, in fact&mdash;in the light of spielers
    who wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to take advantage of Jack&rsquo;s blindness if
    he left him a moment; and he looked ready to knock down the first man who
    stumbled against Jack, or over his luggage&mdash;but that soon wore off.
    Jack was going to stay with Joe at the Coffee Palace for a few weeks, and
    then go back up-country, he told me. He was excited and happy. His brother&rsquo;s
    manner towards him was as if Jack had just lost his wife, or boy or someone
    very dear to him. He would not allow him to do anything for himself, nor
    try to&mdash;not even lace up his boot. He seemed to think that he was thoroughly
    helpless, and when I saw him pack up Jack&rsquo;s things, and help him at
    the table and fix his tie and collar with his great brown hands, which trembled
    all the time with grief and gentleness, and make Jack sit down on the bed
    whilst he got a cab and carried the trap down to it, and take him downstairs
    as if he were made of thin glass, and settle with the landlord&mdash;then
    I knew that Jack was all right.</p>
  <p>We had a drink together&mdash;Joe, Jack, the cabman, and I. Joe was very
    careful to hand Jack the glass, and Jack made joke about it for Joe&rsquo;s
    benefit. He swore he could see a glass yet, and Joe laughed, but looked extra
    troubled the next moment.</p>
  <p>I felt their grips on my hand for five minutes after we parted.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ArvieAspinallsAlarmClock"></a>Arvie Aspinall&rsquo;s Alarm Clock</b></h2>
  <p>In one of these years a paragraph appeared in a daily paper to the effect
    that a constable had discovered a little boy asleep on the steps of Grinder
    Bros&rsquo; factory at four o&rsquo;clock one rainy morning. He awakened
    him, and demanded an explanation.</p>
  <p>The little fellow explained that he worked there, and was frightened of
    being late; he started work at six, and was apparently greatly astonished
    to hear that it was only four. The constable examined a small parcel which
    the frightened child had in his hand. It contained a clean apron and three
    slices of bread and treacle.</p>
  <p>The child further explained that he woke up and thought it was late, and
    didn&rsquo;t like to wake mother and ask her the time &ldquo;because she&rsquo;d
    been washin&rsquo;.&rdquo;  He didn&rsquo;t look at the clock, because they &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
    have one.&rdquo; He volunteered no explanations as to how he expected mother
    to know the time, but, perhaps, like many other mites of his kind, he had
    unbounded faith in the infinitude of a mother&rsquo;s wisdom. His name was
    Arvie Aspinall, please sir, and he lived in Jones&rsquo;s Alley. Father was
    dead.</p>
  <p>A few days later the same paper took great pleasure in stating, in reference
    to that &ldquo;Touching Incident&rdquo; noticed in a recent issue, that a
    benevolent society lady had started a subscription among her friends with
    the object of purchasing an alarm-clock for the little boy found asleep at
    Grinder Bros&rsquo; workshop door.</p>
  <p>Later on, it was mentioned, in connection with the touching incident, that
    the alarm-clock had been bought and delivered to the boy&rsquo;s mother,
    who appeared to be quite overcome with gratitude. It was learned, also, from
    another source, that the last assertion was greatly exaggerated.</p>
  <p>The touching incident was worn out in another paragraph, which left no doubt
    that the benevolent society lady was none other than a charming and accomplished
    daughter of the House of Grinder.</p>
  <p>It was late in the last day of the Easter Holidays, during which Arvie Aspinall
    had lain in bed with a bad cold. He was still what he called &ldquo;croopy.&rdquo;  It
    was about nine o&rsquo;clock, and the business of Jones&rsquo;s Alley was
    in full swing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better, mother, I&rsquo;m far better,&rdquo; said Arvie, &ldquo;the
    sugar and vinegar cuts the phlegm, and the both&rsquo;rin&rsquo; cough gits
    out. It got out to such an extent for the next few minutes that he could
    not speak. When he recovered his breath, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better or worse, I&rsquo;ll have to go to work to-morrow. Gimme the
    clock, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tell you you shall not go! It will be your death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use talking, mother; we can&rsquo;t starve&mdash;and&mdash;s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; somebody
    got my place! Gimme the clock, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send one of the children round to say you&rsquo;re ill.
    They&rsquo;ll surely let you off for a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use; they won&rsquo;t wait; I know them&mdash;what
    does Grinder Bros care if I&rsquo;m ill? Never mind, mother, I&rsquo;ll rise
    above &rsquo;em all yet. <i>Give me the clock</i>, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She gave him the clock, and he proceeded to wind it up and set the alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; wrong with the gong,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    gone wrong two nights now, but I&rsquo;ll chance it. I&rsquo;ll set the alarm
    at five, that&rsquo;ll give me time to dress and git there early. I wish
    I hadn&rsquo;t to walk so far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused to read some words engraved round the dial:</p>
  <p class="note">Early to bed and early to rise<br>
    Makes a man healthy and wealthy and wise.</p>
  <p>He had read the verse often before, and was much taken with the swing and
    rhythm of it. He had repeated it to himself, over and over again, without
    reference to the sense or philosophy of it. He had never dreamed of doubting
    anything in print&mdash;and this was engraved. But now a new light seemed
    to dawn upon him. He studied the sentence awhile, and then read it aloud
    for the second time. He turned it over in his mind again in silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;I think it lies.&rdquo; She
    placed the clock on the shelf, tucked him into his little bed on the sofa,
    and blew out the light.</p>
  <p>Arvie seemed to sleep, but she lay awake thinking of her troubles. Of her
    husband carried home dead from his work one morning; of her eldest son who
    only came to loaf on her when he was out of jail; of the second son, who
    had feathered his nest in another city, and had no use for her any longer;
    of the next&mdash;poor delicate little Arvie&mdash;struggling manfully to
    help, and wearing his young life out at Grinder Bros when he should be at
    school; of the five helpless younger children asleep in the next room: of
    her hard life&mdash;scrubbing floors from half-past five till eight, and
    then starting her day&rsquo;s work&mdash;washing!&mdash;of having to rear
    her children in the atmosphere of the slums, because she could not afford
    to move and pay a higher rent; and of the rent.</p>
  <p>Arvie commenced to mutter in his sleep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you get to sleep, Arvie?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is
    your throat sore? Can I get anything for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sleep,&rdquo; he muttered, dreamily, &ldquo;but
    it won&rsquo;t seem more&rsquo;n a moment before&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before what, Arvie?&rdquo; she asked, quickly, fearing that he was
    becoming delirious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before the alarm goes off!&rdquo;</p>
  <p><i>&nbsp;He was talking in his sleep.</i></p>
  <p>She rose gently and put the alarm on two hours. &ldquo;He can rest now,&rdquo;  she
    whispered to herself.</p>
  <p>Presently Arvie sat bolt upright, and said quickly, &ldquo;Mother! I thought
    the alarm went off!&rdquo; Then, without waiting for an answer, he lay down
    as suddenly and slept.</p>
  <p>The rain had cleared away, and a bright, starry dome was over sea and city,
    over slum and villa alike; but little of it could be seen from the hovel
    in Jones&rsquo;s Alley, save a glimpse of the Southern Cross and a few stars
    round it. It was what ladies call a &ldquo;lovely night,&rdquo; as seen from
    the house of Grinder&mdash;&ldquo;Grinderville&rdquo;&mdash;with its moonlit
    terraces and gardens sloping gently to the water, and its windows lit up
    for an Easter ball, and its reception-rooms thronged by its own exclusive
    set, and one of its charming and accomplished daughters melting a select
    party to tears by her pathetic recitation about a little crossing sweeper.</p>
  <p>There <i>was</i> something wrong with the alarm-clock, or else Mrs Aspinall
    had made a mistake, for the gong sounded startlingly in the dead of night.
    She woke with a painful start, and lay still, expecting to hear Arvie get
    up; but he made no sign. She turned a white, frightened face towards the
    sofa where he lay&mdash;the light from the alley&rsquo;s solitary lamp on
    the pavement above shone down through the window, and she saw that he had
    not moved.</p>
  <p>Why didn&rsquo;t the clock wake him? He was such a light sleeper! &ldquo;Arvie!&rdquo;  she
    called; no answer. &ldquo;Arvie!&rdquo; she called again, with a strange
    ring of remonstrance mingling with the terror in her voice. Arvie never answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! my God!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
  <p>She rose and stood by the sofa. Arvie lay on his back with his arms folded&mdash;a
    favourite sleeping position of his; but his eyes were wide open and staring
    upwards as though they would stare through ceiling and roof to the place
    where God ought to be.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Stragglers"></a>Stragglers</b></h2>
  <p>An oblong hut, walled with blue-grey hardwood slabs, adzed at the ends and
    set horizontally between the round sapling studs; high roof of the eternal
    galvanized iron. A big rubbish heap lies about a yard to the right of the
    door, which opens from the middle of one of the side walls; it might be the
    front or the back wall&mdash;there is nothing to fix it. Two rows of rough
    bunks run round three sides of the interior; and a fire-place occupies one
    end&mdash;the kitchen end. Sleeping, eating, gambling and cooking accommodation
    for thirty men in about eighteen by forty feet.</p>
  <p>The rouseabouts and shearers use the hut in common during shearing. Down
    the centre of the place runs a table made of stakes driven into the ground,
    with cross-pieces supporting a top of half-round slabs set with the flat
    sides up, and affording a few level places for soup-plates; on each side
    are crooked, unbarked poles laid in short forks, to serve as seats. The poles
    are worn smoothest opposite the level places on the table. The floor is littered
    with rubbish&mdash;old wool-bales, newspapers, boots, worn-out shearing pants,
    rough bedding, etc., raked out of the bunks in impatient search for missing
    articles&mdash;signs of a glad and eager departure with cheques when the
    shed last cut out.</p>
  <p>To the west is a dam, holding back a broad, shallow sheet of grey water,
    with dead trees standing in it.</p>
  <p>Further up along this water is a brush shearing-shed, a rough framework
    of poles with a brush roof. This kind of shed has the advantage of being
    cooler than iron. It is not rain-proof, but shearers do not work in rainy
    weather; shearing even slightly damp sheep is considered the surest and quickest
    way to get the worst kind of rheumatism. The floor is covered with rubbish
    from the roof, and here and there lies a rusty pair of shears. A couple of
    dry tar-pots hang by nails in the posts. The &ldquo;board&rdquo; is very
    uneven and must be bad for sweeping. The pens are formed by round, crooked
    stakes driven into the ground in irregular lines, and the whole business
    reminds us of the &ldquo;cubby-house&rdquo; style of architecture of our
    childhood.</p>
  <p>Opposite stands the wool-shed, built entirely of galvanized iron; a blinding
    object to start out of the scrub on a blazing, hot day. God forgive the man
    who invented galvanized iron, and the greed which introduced it into Australia:
    you could not get worse roofing material for a hot country.</p>
  <p>The wool-washing, soap-boiling, and wool-pressing arrangements are further
    up the dam. &ldquo;Government House&rdquo; is a mile away, and is nothing
    better than a bush hut; this station belongs to a company. And the company
    belongs to a bank. And the banks belong to England, mostly.</p>
  <p>Mulga scrub all round, and, in between, patches of reddish sand where the
    grass ought to be.</p>
  <p>It is New Year&rsquo;s Eve. Half a dozen travellers are camping in the hut,
    having a spell. They need it, for there are twenty miles of dry lignum plain
    between here and the government bore to the east; and about eighteen miles
    of heavy, sandy, cleared road north-west to the next water in that direction.
    With one exception, the men do not seem hard up; at least, not as that condition
    is understood by the swagmen of these times. The least lucky one of the lot
    had three weeks&rsquo; work in a shed last season, and there might probably
    be five pounds amongst the whole crowd. They are all shearers, or at least
    they say they are. Some might be only &ldquo;rousers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>These men have a kind of stock hope of getting a few stragglers to shear
    somewhere; but their main object is to live till next shearing. In order
    to do this they must tramp for tucker, and trust to the regulation&mdash;and
    partly mythical&mdash;pint of flour, and bit of meat, or tea and sugar, and
    to the goodness of cooks and storekeepers and boundary-riders. You can only
    depend on getting tucker <i>once</i> at one place; then you must tramp on
    to the next. If you cannot get it once you must go short; but there is a
    lot of energy in an empty stomach. If you get an extra supply you may camp
    for a day and have a spell. To live you must walk. To cease walking is to
    die.</p>
  <p>The Exception is an outcast amongst bush outcasts, and looks better fitted
    for Sydney Domain. He lies on the bottom of a galvanized-iron case, with
    a piece of blue blanket for a pillow. He is dressed in a blue cotton jumper,
    a pair of very old and ragged tweed trousers, and one boot and one slipper.
    He found the slipper in the last shed, and the boot in the rubbish-heap here.
    When his own boots gave out he walked a hundred and fifty miles with his
    feet roughly sewn up in pieces of sacking from an old wool-bale. No sign
    of a patch, or an attempt at mending anywhere about his clothes, and that
    is a bad sign; when a swagman leaves off mending or patching his garments,
    his case is about hopeless. The Exception&rsquo;s swag consists of the aforesaid
    bit of blanket rolled up and tied with pieces of rag. He has no water-bag;
    carries his water in a billy; and how he manages without a bag is known only
    to himself. He has read every scrap of print within reach, and now lies on
    his side, with his face to the wall and one arm thrown up over his head;
    the jumper is twisted back, and leaves his skin bare from hip to arm-pit.
    His lower face is brutal, his eyes small and shifty, and ugly straight lines
    run across his low forehead. He says very little, but scowls most of the
    time&mdash;poor devil. He might be, or at least <i>seem</i>, a totally different
    man under more favourable conditions. He is probably a free labourer.</p>
  <p>A very sick jackaroo lies in one of the bunks. A sandy, sawney-looking Bourke
    native takes great interest in this wreck; watches his every movement as
    though he never saw a sick man before. The men lie about in the bunks, or
    the shade of the hut, and rest, and read all the soiled and mutilated scraps
    of literature they can rake out of the rubbish, and sleep, and wake up swimming
    in perspiration, and growl about the heat.</p>
  <p>It <i>is</i> hot, and two shearers&rsquo; cats&mdash;a black and a white
    one&mdash;sit in one of the upper bunks with their little red tongues out,
    panting like dogs. These cats live well during shearing, and take their chances
    the rest of the year&mdash;just as shed rouseabouts have to do. They seem
    glad to see the traveller come; he makes things more homelike. They curl
    and sidle affectionately round the table-legs, and the legs of the men, and
    purr, and carry their masts up, and regard the cooking with feline interest
    and approval, and look as cheerful as cats can&mdash;and as contented. God
    knows how many tired, dusty, and sockless ankles they rub against in their
    time.</p>
  <p>Now and then a man takes his tucker-bags and goes down to the station for
    a bit of flour, or meat, or tea, or sugar, choosing the time when the manager
    is likely to be out on the run. The cook here is a &ldquo;good cook,&rdquo; from
    a traveller&rsquo;s point of view; too good to keep his place long.</p>
  <p>Occasionally someone gets some water in an old kerosene-tin and washes a
    shirt or pair of trousers, and a pair or two of socks&mdash;or foot-rags&mdash;(Prince
    Alfreds they call them). That is, he soaks some of the stiffness out of these
    articles.</p>
  <p>Three times a day the black billies and cloudy nose-bags are placed on the
    table. The men eat in a casual kind of way, as though it were only a custom
    of theirs, a matter of form&mdash;a habit which could be left off if it were
    worth while.</p>
  <p>The Exception is heard to remark to no one in particular that he&rsquo;ll
    give all he has for a square meal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; ye&rsquo;d get it cheap, begod!&rdquo; says a big Irish
    shearer. &ldquo;Come and have dinner with us; there&rsquo;s plenty there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the Exception only eats a few mouthfuls, and his appetite is gone; his
    stomach has become contracted, perhaps.</p>
  <p>The Wreck cannot eat at all, and seems internally disturbed by the sight
    of others eating.</p>
  <p>One of the men is a cook, and this morning he volunteered good-naturedly
    to bake bread for the rest. His mates amuse themselves by chyacking him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard he&rsquo;s a dirty and slow cook,&rdquo; says one,
    addressing Eternity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; says the cook, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be glad to come to
    me for a pint of flour when I&rsquo;m cooking and you&rsquo;re on the track,
    some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sunset. Some of the men sit at the end of the hut to get the full benefit
    of a breeze which comes from the west. A great bank of rain-clouds is rising
    in that direction, but no one says he thinks it will rain; neither does anybody
    think we&rsquo;re going to have some rain. None but the greenest jackaroo
    would venture that risky and foolish observation. Out here, it can look more
    like rain without raining, and continue to do so for a longer time, than
    in most other places.</p>
  <p>The Wreck went down to the station this afternoon to get some medicine and
    bush medical advice. The Bourke sawney helped him to do up his swag; he did
    it with an awed look and manner, as though he thought it a great distinction
    to be allowed to touch the belongings of such a curiosity. It was afterwards
    generally agreed that it was a good idea for the Wreck to go to the station;
    he would get some physic and, a bit of tucker to take him on. &ldquo;For
    they&rsquo;ll give tucker to a sick man sooner than to a chap what&rsquo;s
    all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Exception is rooting about in the rubbish for the other blucher boot.</p>
  <p>The men get a little more sociable, and &ldquo;feel&rdquo; each other to
    find out who&rsquo;s &ldquo;Union,&rdquo; and talk about water, and exchange
    hints as to good tucker-tracks, and discuss the strike, and curse the squatter
    (which is all they have got to curse), and growl about Union leaders, and
    tell lies against each other sociably. There are tally lies; and lies about
    getting tucker by trickery; and long-tramp-with-heavy-swag-and-no-water lies;
    and lies about getting the best of squatters and bosses-over-the-board; and
    droving, fighting, racing, gambling and drinking lies. Lies <i>ad libitum</i>;
    and every true Australian bushman must try his best to tell a bigger out-back
    lie than the last bush-liar.</p>
  <p>Pat is not quite easy in his mind. He found an old pair of pants in the
    scrub this morning, and cannot decide whether they are better than his own,
    or, rather, whether his own are worse&mdash;if that&rsquo;s possible. He
    does not want to increase the weight of his swag unnecessarily by taking
    both pairs. He reckons that the pants were thrown away when the shed cut
    out last, but then they might have been lying out exposed to the weather
    for a longer period. It is rather an important question, for it is very annoying,
    after you&rsquo;ve mended and patched an old pair of pants, to find, when
    a day or two further on the track, that they are more rotten than the pair
    you left behind.</p>
  <p>There is some growling about the water here, and one of the men makes a
    billy of tea. The water is better cooked. Pint-pots and sugar-bags are groped
    out and brought to the kitchen hut, and each man fills his pannikin; the
    Irishman keeps a thumb on the edge of his, so as to know when the pot is
    full, for it is very dark, and there is no more firewood. You soon know this
    way, especially if you are in the habit of pressing lighted tobacco down
    into your pipe with the top of your thumb. The old slush-lamps are all burnt
    out.</p>
  <p>Each man feels for the mouth of his sugar-bag with one hand while he keeps
    the bearings of his pot with the other.</p>
  <p>The Irishman has lost his match-box, and feels for it all over the table
    without success. He stoops down with his hands on his knees, gets the table-top
    on a level with the flicker of firelight, and &ldquo;moons&rdquo; the object,
    as it were.</p>
  <p>Time to turn in. It is very dark inside and bright moonlight without; every
    crack seems like a ghost peering in. Some of the men will roll up their swags
    on the morrow and depart; some will take another day&rsquo;s spell. It is
    all according to the tucker.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheUnionBuriesItsDead"></a>The Union Buries Its Dead</b></h2>
  <p>While out boating one Sunday afternoon on a billabong across the river,
    we saw a young man on horseback driving some horses along the bank. He said
    it was a fine day, and asked if the water was deep there. The joker of our
    party said it was deep enough to drown him, and he laughed and rode farther
    up. We didn&rsquo;t take-much notice of him.</p>
  <p>Next day a funeral gathered at a corner pub and asked each other in to have
    a drink while waiting for the hearse. They passed away some of the time dancing
    jigs to a piano in the bar parlour. They passed away the rest of the time
    skylarking and fighting.</p>
  <p>The defunct was a young Union labourer, about twenty-five, who had been
    drowned the previous day while trying to swim some horses across a billabong
    of the Darling.</p>
  <p>He was almost a stranger in town, and the fact of his having been a Union
    man accounted for the funeral. The police found some Union papers in his
    swag, and called at the General Labourers&rsquo; Union Office for information
    about him. That&rsquo;s how we knew. The secretary had very little information
    to give. The departed was a &ldquo;Roman,&rdquo; and the majority of the
    town were otherwise&mdash;but Unionism is stronger than creed. Liquor, however,
    is stronger than Unionism; and, when the hearse presently arrived, more than
    two-thirds of the funeral were unable to follow.</p>
  <p>The procession numbered fifteen, fourteen souls following the broken shell
    of a soul. Perhaps not one of the fourteen possessed a soul any more than
    the corpse did&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
  <p>Four or five of the funeral, who were boarders at the pub, borrowed a trap
    which the landlord used to carry passengers to and from the railway station.
    They were strangers to us who were on foot, and we to them. We were all strangers
    to the corpse.</p>
  <p>A horseman, who looked like a drover just returned from a big trip, dropped
    into our dusty wake and followed us a few hundred yards, dragging his packhorse
    behind him, but a friend made wild and demonstrative signals from a hotel
    veranda&mdash;hooking at the air in front with his right hand and jobbing
    his left thumb over his shoulder in the direction of the bar&mdash;so the
    drover hauled off and didn&rsquo;t catch up to us any more. He was a stranger
    to the entire show.</p>
  <p>We walked in twos. There were three twos. It was very hot and dusty; the
    heat rushed in fierce dazzling rays across every iron roof and light-coloured
    wall that was turned to the sun. One or two pubs closed respectfully until
    we got past. They closed their bar doors and the patrons went in and out
    through some side or back entrance for a few minutes. Bushmen seldom grumble
    at an inconvenience of this sort, when it is caused by a funeral. They have
    too much respect for the dead.</p>
  <p>On the way to the cemetery we passed three shearers sitting on the shady
    side of a fence. One was drunk&mdash;very drunk. The other two covered their
    right ears with their hats, out of respect for the departed&mdash;whoever
    he might have been&mdash;and one of them kicked the drunk and muttered something
    to him.</p>
  <p>He straightened himself up, stared, and reached helplessly for his hat,
    which he shoved half off and then on again. Then he made a great effort to
    pull himself together&mdash;and succeeded. He stood up, braced his back against
    the fence, knocked off his hat, and remorsefully placed his foot on it&mdash;to
    keep it off his head till the funeral passed.</p>
  <p>A tall, sentimental drover, who walked by my side, cynically quoted Byronic
    verses suitable to the occasion&mdash;to death&mdash;and asked with pathetic
    humour whether we thought the dead man&rsquo;s ticket would be recognized &ldquo;over
    yonder.&rdquo; It was a G.L.U. ticket, and the general opinion was that it
    would be recognized.</p>
  <p>Presently my friend said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember when we were in the boat yesterday, we saw a man driving
    some horses along the bank?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nodded at the hearse and said &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought awhile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;He
    said something, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; said it was a fine day. You&rsquo;d have taken more notice if
    you&rsquo;d known that he was doomed to die in the hour, and that those were
    the last words he would say to any man in this world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said a full voice from the rear. &ldquo;If ye&rsquo;d
    known that, ye&rsquo;d have prolonged the conversation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We plodded on across the railway line and along the hot, dusty road which
    ran to the cemetery, some of us talking about the accident, and lying about
    the narrow escapes we had had ourselves. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked up and saw a priest standing in the shade of the tree by the cemetery
    gate.</p>
  <p>The hearse was drawn up and the tail-boards were opened. The funeral extinguished
    its right ear with its hat as four men lifted the coffin out and laid it
    over the grave. The priest&mdash;a pale, quiet young fellow&mdash;stood under
    the shade of a sapling which grew at the head of the grave. He took off his
    hat, dropped it carelessly on the ground, and proceeded to business. I noticed
    that one or two heathens winced slightly when the holy water was sprinkled
    on the coffin. The drops quickly evaporated, and the little round black spots
    they left were soon dusted over; but the spots showed, by contrast, the cheapness
    and shabbiness of the cloth with which the coffin was covered. It seemed
    black before; now it looked a dusky grey.</p>
  <p>Just here man&rsquo;s ignorance and vanity made a farce of the funeral.
    A big, bull-necked publican, with heavy, blotchy features, and a supremely
    ignorant expression, picked up the priest&rsquo;s straw hat and held it about
    two inches over the head of his reverence during the whole of the service.
    The father, be it remembered, was standing in the shade. A few shoved their
    hats on and off uneasily, struggling between their disgust for the living
    and their respect for the dead. The hat had a conical crown and a brim sloping
    down all round like a sunshade, and the publican held it with his great red
    claw spread over the crown. To do the priest justice, perhaps he didn&rsquo;t
    notice the incident. A stage priest or parson in the same position might
    have said, &ldquo;Put the hat down, my friend; is not the memory of our departed
    brother worth more than my complexion?&rdquo; A wattle-bark layman might
    have expressed himself in stronger language, none the less to the point.
    But my priest seemed unconscious of what was going on. Besides, the publican
    was a great and important pillar of the church. He couldn&rsquo;t, as an
    ignorant and conceited ass, lose such a good opportunity of asserting his
    faithfulness and importance to his church.</p>
  <p>The grave looked very narrow under the coffin, and I drew a breath of relief
    when the box slid easily down. I saw a coffin get stuck once, at Rookwood,
    and it had to be yanked out with difficulty, and laid on the sods at the
    feet of the heart-broken relations, who howled dismally while the grave-diggers
    widened the hole. But they don&rsquo;t cut contracts so fine in the West.
    Our grave-digger was not altogether bowelless, and, out of respect for that
    human quality described as  &ldquo;feelin&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he scraped up some
    light and dusty soil and threw it down to deaden the fall of the clay lumps
    on the coffin. He also tried to steer the first few shovelfuls gently down
    against the end of the grave with the back of the shovel turned outwards,
    but the hard dry Darling River clods rebounded and knocked all the same.
    It didn&rsquo;t matter much&mdash;nothing does. The fall of lumps of clay
    on a stranger&rsquo;s coffin doesn&rsquo;t sound any different from the fall
    of the same things on an ordinary wooden box&mdash;at least I didn&rsquo;t
    notice anything awesome or unusual in the sound; but, perhaps, one of us&mdash;the
    most sensitive&mdash;might have been impressed by being reminded of a burial
    of long ago, when the thump of every sod jolted his heart.</p>
  <p>I have left out the wattle&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t there. I have also
    neglected to mention the heart-broken old mate, with his grizzled head bowed
    and great pearly drops streaming down his rugged cheeks. He was absent&mdash;he
    was probably &ldquo;Out Back.&rdquo;  For similar reasons I have omitted
    reference to the suspicious moisture in the eyes of a bearded bush ruffian
    named Bill. Bill failed to turn up, and the only moisture was that which
    was induced by the heat. I have left out the &ldquo;sad Australian sunset&rdquo;  because
    the sun was not going down at the time. The burial took place exactly at
    midday.</p>
  <p>The dead bushman&rsquo;s name was Jim, apparently; but they found no portraits,
    nor locks of hair, nor any love letters, nor anything of that kind in his
    swag&mdash;not even a reference to his mother; only some papers relating
    to Union matters. Most of us didn&rsquo;t know the name till we saw it on
    the coffin; we knew him as &ldquo;that poor chap that got drowned yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So his name&rsquo;s James Tyson,&rdquo; said my drover acquaintance,
    looking at the plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Didn&rsquo;t you know that before?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; but I knew he was a Union man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It turned out, afterwards, that J.T. wasn&rsquo;t his real name&mdash;only &ldquo;the
    name he went by.&rdquo; Anyhow he was buried by it, and most of the &ldquo;Great
    Australian Dailies&rdquo; have mentioned in their brevity columns that a
    young man named James John Tyson was drowned in a billabong of the Darling
    last Sunday.</p>
  <p>We did hear, later on, what his real name was; but if we ever chance to
    read it in the &ldquo;Missing Friends Column,&rdquo; we shall not be able
    to give any information to heart-broken mother or sister or wife, nor to
    anyone who could let him hear something to his advantage&mdash;for we have
    already forgotten the name.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d been away from home for eight years,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to his mate, as they dropped their swags in the mulga shade and sat down. &ldquo;I
    hadn&rsquo;t written a letter&mdash;kept putting it off, and a blundering
    fool of a fellow that got down the day before me told the old folks that
    he&rsquo;d heard I was dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here he took a pull at his water-bag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I got home they were all in mourning for me. It was night, and
    the girl that opened the door screamed and fainted away like a shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lit his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother was upstairs howling and moaning in a chair, with all the
    girls boo-hoo-ing round her for company. The old man was sitting in the back
    kitchen crying to himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He put his hat down on the ground, dinted in the crown, and poured some
    water into the hollow for his cattle-pup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girls came rushing down. Mother was so pumped out that she couldn&rsquo;t
    get up. They thought at first I was a ghost, and then they all tried to get
    holt of me at once&mdash;nearly smothered me. Look at that pup! You want
    to carry a tank of water on a dry stretch when you&rsquo;ve got a pup that
    drinks as much as two men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He poured a drop more water into the top of his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, mother screamed and nearly fainted when she saw me. Such a
    picnic you never saw. They kept it up all night. I thought the old cove was
    gone off his chump. The old woman wouldn&rsquo;t let go my hand for three
    mortal hours. Have you got the knife?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He cut up some more tobacco.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All next day the house was full of neighbours, and the first to come
    was an old sweetheart of mine; I never thought she cared for me till then.
    Mother and the girls made me swear never to go away any more; and they kept
    watching me, and hardly let me go outside for fear I&rsquo;d&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get drunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;you&rsquo;re smart&mdash;for fear I&rsquo;d clear. At last
    I swore on the Bible that I&rsquo;d never leave home while the old folks
    were alive; and then mother seemed easier in her mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rolled the pup over and examined his feet. &ldquo;I expect I&rsquo;ll
    have to carry him a bit&mdash;his feet are sore. Well, he&rsquo;s done pretty
    well this morning, and anyway he won&rsquo;t drink so much when he&rsquo;s
    carried.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You broke your promise about leaving home,&rdquo; said his mate.</p>
  <p>Mitchell stood up, stretched himself, and looked dolefully from his heavy
    swag to the wide, hot, shadeless cotton-bush plain ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he yawned, &ldquo;I stopped at home for a week, and
    then they began to growl because I couldn&rsquo;t get any work to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate guffawed and Mitchell grinned. They shouldered the swags, with
    the pup on top of Mitchell&rsquo;s, took up their billies and water-bags,
    turned their unshaven faces to the wide, hazy distance, and left the timber
    behind them.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="InADrySeason"></a>In A Dry Season</b></h2>
  <p>Draw a wire fence and a few ragged gums, and add some scattered sheep running
    away from the train. Then you&rsquo;ll have the bush all along the New South
    Wales western line from Bathurst on.</p>
  <p>The railway towns consist of a public house and a general store, with a
    square tank and a school-house on piles in the nearer distance. The tank
    stands at the end of the school and is not many times smaller than the building
    itself. It is safe to call the pub &ldquo;The Railway Hotel,&rdquo; and the
    store &ldquo;The Railway Stores,&rdquo;  with an &ldquo;s.&rdquo; A couple
    of patient, ungroomed hacks are probably standing outside the pub, while
    their masters are inside having a drink&mdash;several drinks. Also it&rsquo;s
    safe to draw a sundowner sitting listlessly on a bench on the veranda, reading
    the <i>Bulletin</i>. The Railway Stores seem to exist only in the shadow
    of the pub, and it is impossible to conceive either as being independent
    of the other. There is sometimes a small, oblong weather-board building&mdash;unpainted,
    and generally leaning in one of the eight possible directions, and perhaps
    with a twist in another&mdash;which, from its half-obliterated sign, seems
    to have started as a rival to the Railway Stores; but the shutters are up
    and the place empty.</p>
  <p>The only town I saw that differed much from the above consisted of a box-bark
    humpy with a clay chimney, and a woman standing at the door throwing out
    the wash-up water.</p>
  <p>By way of variety, the artist might make a water-colour sketch of a fettler&rsquo;s
    tent on the line, with a billy hanging over the fire in front, and three
    fettlers standing round filling their pipes.</p>
  <p>Slop sac suits, red faces, and old-fashioned, flat-brimmed hats, with wire
    round the brims, begin to drop into the train on the other side of Bathurst;
    and here and there a hat with three inches of crape round the crown, which
    perhaps signifies death in the family at some remote date, and perhaps doesn&rsquo;t.
    Sometimes, I believe, it only means grease under the band. I notice that
    when a bushman puts crape round his hat he generally leaves it there till
    the hat wears out, or another friend dies. In the latter case, he buys a
    new piece of crape. This outward sign of bereavement usually has a jolly
    red face beneath it. Death is about the only cheerful thing in the bush.</p>
  <p>We crossed the Macquarie&mdash;a narrow, muddy gutter with a dog swimming
    across, and three goats interested.</p>
  <p>A little farther on we saw the first sundowner. He carried a Royal Alfred,
    and had a billy in one hand and a stick in the other. He was dressed in a
    tail-coat turned yellow, a print shirt, and a pair of moleskin trousers,
    with big square calico patches on the knees; and his old straw hat was covered
    with calico. Suddenly he slipped his swag, dropped his billy, and ran forward,
    boldly flourishing the stick. I thought that he was mad, and was about to
    attack the train, but he wasn&rsquo;t; he was only killing a snake. I didn&rsquo;t
    have time to see whether he cooked the snake or not&mdash;perhaps he only
    thought of Adam.</p>
  <p>Somebody told me that the country was very dry on the other side of Nevertire.
    It is. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to sit down on it any where. The least horrible
    spot in the bush, in a dry season, is where the bush isn&rsquo;t&mdash;where
    it has been cleared away and a green crop is trying to grow. They talk of
    settling people on the land! Better settle <i>in</i> it. I&rsquo;d rather
    settle on the water; at least, until some gigantic system of irrigation is
    perfected in the West.</p>
  <p>Along about Byrock we saw the first shearers. They dress like the unemployed,
    but differ from that body in their looks of independence. They sat on trucks
    and wool-bales and the fence, watching the train, and hailed Bill, and Jim,
    and Tom, and asked how those individuals were getting on.</p>
  <p>Here we came across soft felt hats with straps round the crowns, and full-bearded
    faces under them. Also a splendid-looking black tracker in a masher uniform
    and a pair of Wellington boots.</p>
  <p>One or two square-cuts and stand-up collars struggle dismally through to
    the bitter end. Often a member of the unemployed starts cheerfully out, with
    a letter from the Government Labour Bureau in his pocket, and nothing else.
    He has an idea that the station where he has the job will be within easy
    walking distance of Bourke. Perhaps he thinks there&rsquo;ll be a cart or
    a buggy waiting for him. He travels for a night and day without a bite to
    eat, and, on arrival, he finds that the station is eighty or a hundred miles
    away. Then he has to explain matters to a publican and a coach-driver. God
    bless the publican and the coach-driver! God forgive our social system!</p>
  <p>Native industry was represented at one place along the line by three tiles,
    a chimney-pot, and a length of piping on a slab.</p>
  <p>Somebody said to me, &ldquo;Yer wanter go out back, young man, if yer wanter
    see the country. Yer wanter get away from the line.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    wanter; I&rsquo;ve been there.</p>
  <p>You could go to the brink of eternity so far as Australia is concerned and
    yet meet an animated mummy of a swagman who will talk of going &ldquo;out
    back.&rdquo; Out upon the out-back fiend!</p>
  <p>About Byrock we met the bush liar in all his glory. He was dressed like&mdash;like
    a bush larrikin. His name was Jim. He had been to a ball where some blank
    had &ldquo;touched&rdquo; his blanky overcoat. The overcoat had a cheque
    for ten &ldquo;quid&rdquo; in the pocket. He didn&rsquo;t seem to feel the
    loss much. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s ten quid?&rdquo; He&rsquo;d been everywhere,
    including the Gulf country. He still had three or four sheds to go to. He
    had telegrams in his pocket from half a dozen squatters and supers offering
    him pens on any terms. He didn&rsquo;t give a blank whether he took them
    or no. He thought at first he had the telegrams on him but found that he
    had left them in the pocket of the overcoat aforesaid. He had learned butchering
    in a day. He was a bit of a scrapper himself and talked a lot about the ring.
    At the last station where he shore he gave the super the father of a hiding.
    The super was a big chap, about six-foot-three, and had knocked out Paddy
    Somebody in one round. He worked with a man who shore four hundred sheep
    in nine hours.</p>
  <p>Here a quiet-looking bushman in a corner of the carriage grew restless,
    and presently he opened his mouth and took the liar down in about three minutes.</p>
  <p>At 5.30 we saw a long line of camels moving out across the sunset. There&rsquo;s
    something snaky about camels. They remind me of turtles and goannas.</p>
  <p>Somebody said, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Bourke.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HedComeBack"></a>He&rsquo;d Come Back</b></h2>
  <p>The yarn was all lies, I suppose; but it wasn&rsquo;t bad. A city bushman
    told it, of course, and he told it in the travellers&rsquo; hut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As true&rsquo;s God hears me I never meant to desert her in cold
    blood,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d only been married about two years,
    and we&rsquo;d got along grand together; but times was hard, and I had to
    jump at the first chance of a job, and leave her with her people, an&rsquo; go
    up-country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused and fumbled with his pipe until all ears were brought to bear
    on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was a beauty, and no mistake; she was far too good for me&mdash;I
    often wondered how she came to have a chap like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused again, and the others thought over it&mdash;and wondered too,
    perhaps.</p>
  <p>The joker opened his lips to speak, but altered his mind about it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I travelled up into Queensland, and worked back into Victoria  &rsquo;n&rsquo; South
    Australia, an&rsquo; I wrote home pretty reg&rsquo;lar and sent what money
    I could. Last I got down on to the south-western coast of South Australia&mdash;an&rsquo; there
    I got mixed up with another woman&mdash;you know what that means, boys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sympathetic silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this went on for two years, and then the other woman drove
    me to drink. You know what a woman can do when the devil&rsquo;s in her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sound between a sigh and a groan from Lally Thompson. &ldquo;My oath,&rdquo; he
    said, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have made it <i>three</i> years, Jack,&rdquo; interposed
    the joker; &ldquo;you said two years before.&rdquo; But he was suppressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I got free of them both, at last&mdash;drink and the woman,
    I mean; but it took another&mdash;it took a couple of years to pull myself
    straight&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the joker opened his mouth again, but was warmly requested to shut
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, chaps, I got thinking. My conscience began to hurt me, and&mdash;and
    hurt worse every day. It nearly drove me to drink again. Ah, boys, a man&mdash;if
    he is a man&mdash;can&rsquo;t expect to wrong a woman and escape scot-free
    in the end.&rdquo; (Sigh from Lally Thompson.) &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the one
    thing that always comes home to a man, sooner or later&mdash;you know what
    that means, boys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lally Thompson: &ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The joker: &ldquo;Dry up yer crimson oath! What do you know about women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Cries of &ldquo;Order!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued the story-teller, &ldquo;I got thinking. I
    heard that my wife had broken her heart when I left her, and that made matters
    worse. I began to feel very bad about it. I felt mean. I felt disgusted with
    myself. I pictured my poor, ill-treated, little wife and children in misery
    and poverty, and my conscience wouldn&rsquo;t let me rest night or day&rdquo;&mdash;(Lally
    Thompson seemed greatly moved)&mdash;&ldquo;so at last I made up my mind
    to be a man, and make&mdash;what&rsquo;s the word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reparation,&rdquo; suggested the joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, so I slaved like a nigger for a year or so, got a few pounds
    together and went to find my wife. I found out that she was living in a cottage
    in Burwood, Sydney, and struggling through the winter on what she&rsquo;d
    saved from the money her father left her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got a shave and dressed up quiet and decent. I was older-looking
    and more subdued like, and I&rsquo;d got pretty grey in those few years that
    I&rsquo;d been making a fool of myself; and, some how, I felt rather glad
    about it, because I reckoned she&rsquo;d notice it first thing&mdash;she
    was always quick at noticing things&mdash;and forgive me all the quicker.
    Well, I waylaid the school kids that evening, and found out mine&mdash;a
    little boy and a girl&mdash;and fine youngsters they were. The girl took
    after her mother, and the youngster was the dead spit o&rsquo; me. I gave &rsquo;em
    half a crown each and told them to tell their mother that someone would come
    when the sun went down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bogan Bill nodded approvingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So at sundown I went and knocked at the door. It opened and there
    stood my little wife looking prettier than ever&mdash;only careworn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long, impressive pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, what did she do?&rdquo; asked Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack sighed and straightened himself up: &ldquo;She said&mdash;she said&mdash;&rsquo;Well,
    so you&rsquo;ve come back.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Painful silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Jack, and what did you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and so you had!&rdquo; said Tom Moonlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that, Tom,&rdquo; said Jack sadly and wearily&mdash;&ldquo;<i>It
      was the way she said it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lally Thompson rubbed his eyes: &ldquo;And what did you do, Jack?&rdquo; he
    asked gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stayed for a year, and then I deserted her again&mdash;but meant
    it that time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s time to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnotherOfMitchellsPlansForTheFuture"></a>Another Of Mitchell&rsquo;s Plans For The Future</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get down among the cockies along the Lachlan, or some
    of these rivers,&rdquo; said Mitchell, throwing down his swag beneath a big
    tree. &ldquo;A man stands a better show down there. It&rsquo;s a mistake
    to come out back. I knocked around a good deal down there among the farms.
    Could always get plenty of tucker, and a job if I wanted it. One cocky I
    worked for wanted me to stay with him for good. Sorry I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;d
    have been better off now. I was treated more like one of the family, and
    there was a couple of good-looking daughters. One of them was clean gone
    on me. There are some grand girls down that way. I always got on well with
    the girls, because I could play the fiddle and sing a bit. They&rsquo;ll
    be glad to see me when I get back there again, I know. I&rsquo;ll be all
    right&mdash;no more bother about tucker. I&rsquo;ll just let things slide
    as soon as I spot the house. I&rsquo;ll bet my boots the kettle will be boiling,
    and everything in the house will be on the table before I&rsquo;m there twenty
    minutes. And the girls will be running to meet the old cocky when he comes
    riding home at night, and they&rsquo;ll let down the sliprails, and ask him
    to guess  &lsquo;who&rsquo;s up at our place?&rsquo; Yes, I&rsquo;ll find
    a job with some old cocky, with a good-looking daughter or two. I&rsquo;ll
    get on ploughing if I can; that&rsquo;s the sort of work I like; best graft
    about a farm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By and by the cocky&rsquo;ll have a few sheep he wants shorn, and
    one day he&rsquo;ll say to me, &lsquo;Jack, if you hear of a shearer knockin&rsquo; round
    let me know&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a few sheep I want shore.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;How many have you got?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, about fifteen hundred.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And what d&rsquo;you think of giving?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, about twenty-five bob a hundred, but if a shearer sticks
    out for thirty, send him up to talk with me. I want to get &rsquo;em shore
    as soon as possible.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;you needn&rsquo;t
    bother; I&rsquo;ll shear your sheep.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;can <i>you</i> shear?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Shear? Of course I can! I shore before you were born.&rsquo; It
    won&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s twice as old as me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll shear his sheep and make a few pounds, and he&rsquo;ll
    be glad and all the more eager to keep me on, so&rsquo;s to always have someone
    to shear his sheep. But by and by I&rsquo;ll get tired of stopping in the
    one place and want to be on the move, so I&rsquo;ll tell him I&rsquo;m going
    to leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what do you want to go for?&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, surprised, &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t
    you satisfied?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes, I&rsquo;m satisfied, but I want a change.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say; &lsquo;stop and
    we&rsquo;ll call it twenty-five bob a week.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell him I&rsquo;m off&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t stay for
    a hundred when I&rsquo;d made up my mind; so, when he sees he can&rsquo;t
    persuade me he&rsquo;ll get a bit stiff and say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, what about that there girl? Are you goin&rsquo; to go
    away and leave her like that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, what d&rsquo;yer mean?&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;Leave
    her like what?&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t pretend to know what he&rsquo;s driving
    at.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;you know very well what
    I mean. The question is: <i>Are you going to marry the girl or not</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that things are gettin&rsquo; a little warm and that
    I&rsquo;m in a corner, so I&rsquo;ll say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, I never thought about it. This is pretty sudden and out
    of the common, isn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t mind marrying the girl if she&rsquo;ll
    have me. Why! I haven&rsquo;t asked her yet!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, look here,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;if you agree
    to marry the girl&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll make you marry her, any road&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    give you that there farm over there and a couple of hundred to start on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So, I&rsquo;ll marry her and settle down and be a cocky myself and
    if you ever happen to be knocking round there hard up, you needn&rsquo;t
    go short of tucker a week or two; but don&rsquo;t come knocking round the
    house when I&rsquo;m not at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Steelman"></a>Steelman</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman was a hard case. If you were married, and settled down, and were
    so unfortunate as to have known Steelman in other days, he would, if in your
    neighbourhood and dead-beat, be sure to look you up. He would find you anywhere,
    no matter what precautions you might take. If he came to your house, he would
    stay to tea without invitation, and if he stayed to tea, he would ask you
    to &ldquo;fix up a shake-down on the floor, old man,&rdquo; and put him up
    for the night; and, if he stopped all night, he&rsquo;d remain&mdash;well,
    until something better turned up.</p>
  <p>There was no shaking off Steelman. He had a way about him which would often
    make it appear as if you had invited him to stay, and pressed him against
    his roving inclination, and were glad to have him round for company, while
    he remained only out of pure goodwill to you. He didn&rsquo;t like to offend
    an old friend by refusing his invitation.</p>
  <p>Steelman knew his men.</p>
  <p>The married victim generally had neither the courage nor the ability to
    turn him out. He was cheerfully blind and deaf to all hints, and if the exasperated
    missus said anything to him straight, he would look shocked, and reply, as
    likely as not:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, my good woman, you must be mad! I&rsquo;m your husband&rsquo;s
    guest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And if she wouldn&rsquo;t cook for him, he&rsquo;d cook for himself. There
    was no choking him off. Few people care to call the police in a case like
    this; and besides, as before remarked, Steelman knew his men. The only way
    to escape from him was to move&mdash;but then, as likely as not, he&rsquo;d
    help pack up and come along with his portmanteau right on top of the last
    load of furniture, and drive you and your wife to the verge of madness by
    the calm style in which he proceeded to superintend the hanging of your pictures.</p>
  <p>Once he quartered himself like this on an old schoolmate of his, named Brown,
    who had got married and steady and settled down. Brown tried all ways to
    get rid of Steelman, but he couldn&rsquo;t do it. One day Brown said to Steelman:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Steely, old man, I&rsquo;m very sorry, but I&rsquo;m afraid
    we won&rsquo;t be able to accommodate you any longer&mdash;to make you comfortable,
    I mean. You see, a sister of the missus is coming down on a visit for a month
    or two, and we ain&rsquo;t got anywhere to put her, except in your room.
    I wish the missus&rsquo;s relations to blazes! I didn&rsquo;t marry the whole
    blessed family; but it seems I&rsquo;ve got to keep them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause&mdash;very awkward and painful for poor Brown. Discouraging silence
    from Steelman. Brown rested his elbows on his knees, and, with a pathetic
    and appealing movement of his hand across his forehead, he continued desperately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry, you see, old man&mdash;you know I&rsquo;d like
    you to stay&mdash;I want you to stay.... It isn&rsquo;t my fault&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    the missus&rsquo;s doings. I&rsquo;ve done my best with her, but I can&rsquo;t
    help it. I&rsquo;ve been more like a master in my own house&mdash;more comfortable&mdash;and
    I&rsquo;ve been better treated since I&rsquo;ve had you to back me up....
    I&rsquo;ll feel mighty lonely, anyway, when you&rsquo;re gone.... But...
    you know... as soon as her sister goes... you know.... &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here poor Brown broke down&mdash;very sorry he had spoken at all; but Steely
    came to the rescue with a ray of light.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the little room at the back?&rdquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we couldn&rsquo;t think of putting you there,&rdquo; said Brown,
    with a last effort; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not fined up; you wouldn&rsquo;t be
    comfortable, and, besides, it&rsquo;s damp, and you&rsquo;d catch your death
    of cold. It was never meant for anything but a wash-house. I&rsquo;m sorry
    I didn&rsquo;t get another room built on to the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh!&rdquo; interrupted Steelman, cheerfully. &ldquo;Catch a cold!
    Here I&rsquo;ve been knocking about the country for the last five years&mdash;sleeping
    out in all weathers&mdash;and do you think a little damp is going to hurt
    me? Pooh! What do you take me for? Don&rsquo;t you bother your head about
    it any more, old man; I&rsquo;ll fix up the lumber-room for myself, all right;
    and all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to let me know when the sister-in-law business
    is coming on, and I&rsquo;ll shift out of my room in time for the missus
    to get it ready for her. Here, have you got a bob on you? I&rsquo;ll go out
    and get some beer. A drop&rsquo;ll do you good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if you can make yourself comfortable, I&rsquo;ll be only too
    glad for you to stay,&rdquo; said Brown, wearily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better invite some woman you know to come on a visit,
    and pass her off as your sister,&rdquo; said Brown to his wife, while Steelman
    was gone for the beer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a mess of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Brown said, &ldquo;I knew you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman knew his men.</p>
  <p>But at last Brown reckoned that he could stand it no longer. The thought
    of it made him so wild that he couldn&rsquo;t work. He took a day off to
    get thoroughly worked up in, came home that night full to the chin of indignation
    and Dunedin beer, and tried to kick Steelman out. And Steelman gave him a
    hiding.</p>
  <p>Next morning Steelman was sitting beside Brown&rsquo;s bed with a saucer
    of vinegar, some brown paper, a raw beef-steak, and a bottle of soda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what have you got to say for yourself now, Brown?&rdquo; he
    said, sternly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you jolly well ashamed of yourself to come
    home in the beastly state you did last night, and insult a guest in your
    house, to say nothing of an old friend&mdash;and perhaps the best friend
    you ever had, if you only knew it? Anybody else would have given you in charge
    and got you three months for the assault. You ought to have some consideration
    for your wife and children, and your own character&mdash;even if you haven&rsquo;t
    any for your old mate&rsquo;s feelings. Here, drink this, and let me fix
    you up a bit; the missus has got the breakfast waiting.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DriftedBack"></a>Drifted Back</b></h2>
  <p>The stranger walked into the corner grocery with the air of one who had
    come back after many years to see someone who would be glad to see him. He
    shed his swag and stood it by the wall with great deliberation; then he rested
    his elbow on the counter, stroked his beard, and grinned quizzically at the
    shopman, who smiled back presently in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; said the grocer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice day,&rdquo; said the grocer.</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything I can do for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; tell the old man there&rsquo;s a chap wants to speak to him
    for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old man? What old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hake, of course&mdash;old Ben Hake! Ain&rsquo;t he in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The grocer smiled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hake ain&rsquo;t here now. I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, he sold out to me ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll find him somewhere about town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you will. He left Australia when he sold out.
    He&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s dead now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead! Old Ben Hake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You knew him, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The stranger seemed to have lost a great deal of his assurance. He turned
    his side to the counter, hooked his elbow on it, and gazed out through the
    door along Sunset Track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can give me half a pound of nailrod,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet
    tone&mdash;&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose young Hake is in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; the whole family went away. I think there&rsquo;s one of the
    sons in business in Sydney now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose the M&rsquo;Lachlans are here yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; they are not. The old people died about five years ago; the sons
    are in Queensland, I think; and both the girls are married and in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... I see you&rsquo;ve got the railway here now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Six years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Times is changed a lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose you can tell me where I&rsquo;ll
    find old Jimmy Nowlett?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jimmy Nowlett? Jimmy Nowlett? I never heard of the name. What was
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he was a bullock-driver. Used to carry from the mountains before
    the railway was made.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before my time, perhaps. There&rsquo;s no one of that name round
    here now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... I don&rsquo;t suppose you knew the Duggans?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did. The old man&rsquo;s dead, too, and the family&rsquo;s
    gone away&mdash;Lord knows where. They weren&rsquo;t much loss, to all accounts.
    The sons got into trouble, I b&rsquo;lieve&mdash;went to the bad. They had
    a bad name here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they? Well, they had good hearts&mdash;at least, old Malachi
    Duggan and the eldest son had.... You can give me a couple of pounds of sugar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right. I suppose it&rsquo;s a long time since you were here last?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifteen years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose I remind you of anyone you know around
    here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no!&rdquo; said the grocer with a smile. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
    say you do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll find the Wilds still living in
    the same place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Wilds? Well, no. The old man is dead, too, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and where&rsquo;s Jim? He ain&rsquo;t dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s married and settled down in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you&mdash;&rdquo; said the stranger, hesitatingly; &ldquo;did
    you&mdash;I suppose you knew Mary&mdash;Mary Wild?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary?&rdquo; said the grocer, smilingly. &ldquo;That was my wife&rsquo;s
    maiden name. Would you like to see her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no! She mightn&rsquo;t remember me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reached hastily for his swag, and shouldered it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be gettin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;ll camp here over Christmas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; there&rsquo;s nothing to stop here for&mdash;I&rsquo;ll push
    on. I did intend to have a Christmas here&mdash;in fact, I came a long way
    out of my road a-purpose.... I meant to have just one more Christmas with
    old Ben Hake an&rsquo; the rest of the boys&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t know
    as they&rsquo;d moved on so far west. The old bush school is dyin&rsquo; out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a smile in his eyes, but his bearded lips twitched a little.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Things is changed. The old houses is pretty much the same, an&rsquo; the
    old signs want touchin&rsquo; up and paintin&rsquo; jest as had as ever;
    an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s that old palin&rsquo; fence that me an&rsquo; Ben
    Hake an&rsquo; Jimmy Nowlett put up twenty year ago. I&rsquo;ve tramped and
    travelled long ways since then. But things is changed&mdash;at least, people
    is.... Well, I must be goin&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s nothing to keep me here.
    I&rsquo;ll push on and get into my track again. It&rsquo;s cooler travellin&rsquo; in
    the night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s been pretty hot to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it has. Well, s&rsquo;long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day. Merry Christmas!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh? What? Oh, yes! Same to you! S&rsquo;long!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day!&rdquo; He drifted out and away along Sunset Track.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Remailed"></a>Remailed</b></h2>
  <p>There is an old custom prevalent in Australasia&mdash;and other parts, too,
    perhaps, for that matter&mdash;which, we think, deserves to be written up.
    It might not be an &ldquo;honoured&rdquo; custom from a newspaper manager&rsquo;s
    or proprietor&rsquo;s point of view, or from the point of view (if any) occupied
    by the shareholders on the subject; but, nevertheless, it is a time-honoured
    and a good old custom. Perhaps, for several reasons, it was more prevalent
    among diggers than with the comparatively settled bushmen of to-day&mdash;the
    poor, hopeless, wandering swaggy doesn&rsquo;t count in the matter, for he
    has neither the wherewithal nor the opportunity to honour the old custom;
    also his movements are too sadly uncertain to permit of his being honoured
    by it. We refer to the remailing of newspapers and journals from one mate
    to another.</p>
  <p>Bill gets his paper and reads it through conscientiously from beginning
    to end by candle or slush-lamp as he lies on his back in the hut or tent
    with his pipe in his mouth; or, better still, on a Sunday afternoon as he
    reclines on the grass in the shade, in all the glory and comfort of a clean
    pair of moleskins and socks and a clean shirt. And when he has finished reading
    the paper&mdash;if it is not immediately bespoke&mdash;he turns it right
    side out, folds it, and puts it away where he&rsquo;ll know where to find
    it. The paper is generally bespoke in the following manner:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look at that paper after you, Bill, when yer done
    with it,&rdquo; says Jack.</p>
  <p>And Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I just promised it to Bob. You can get it after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, when it is finally lent, Bill says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to give that paper back to me when yer done with
    it. Don&rsquo;t let any of those other blanks get holt of it, or the chances
    are I won&rsquo;t set eyes on it again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the other blanks get it in their turn after being referred to Bill.  &ldquo;You
    must ask Bill,&rdquo; says Jack to the next blank, &ldquo;I got it from him.&rdquo; And
    when Bill gets his paper back finally&mdash;which is often only after much
    bush grumbling, accusation, recrimination, and denial&mdash;he severely and
    carefully re-arranges the pages, folds the paper, and sticks it away up
    over a rafter, or behind a post or batten, or under his pillow where it will
    safe. He wants that paper to send to Jim.</p>
  <p>Bill is but an indifferent hand at folding, and knows little or nothing
    about wrappers. He folds and re-folds the paper several times and in various
    ways, but the first result is often the best, and is finally adopted. The
    parcel looks more ugly than neat; but Bill puts a weight upon it so that
    it won&rsquo;t fly open, and looks round for a piece of string to tie it
    with. Sometimes he ties it firmly round the middle, sometimes at both ends;
    at other times he runs the string down inside the folds and ties it that
    way, or both ways, or all the ways, so as to be sure it won&rsquo;t come
    undone&mdash;which it doesn&rsquo;t as a rule. If he can&rsquo;t find a piece
    of string long enough, he ties two bits together, and submits the result
    to a rather severe test; and if the string is too thin, or he has to use
    thread, he doubles it. Then he worries round to find out who has got the
    ink, or whether anyone has seen anything of the pen; and when he gets them,
    he writes the address with painful exactitude on the margin of the paper,
    sometimes in two or three places. He has to think a moment before he writes;
    and perhaps he&rsquo;ll scratch the back of his head afterwards with an inky
    finger, and regard the address with a sort of mild, passive surprise. His
    old mate Jim was always plain Jim to him, and nothing else; but, in order
    to reach Jim, this paper has to be addressed to&mdash;</p>
  <p>Mr. James Mitchell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c/o J.&nbsp;  W.&nbsp; Dowell, Esq.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Munnigrub
  Station&mdash;</p>
  <p>and so on. &ldquo;Mitchell&rdquo; seems strange&mdash;Bill couldn&rsquo;t
    think of it for the moment&mdash;and so does &ldquo;James.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, a week or so later, over on Coolgardie, or away up in northern Queensland,
    or bush-felling down in Maoriland, Jim takes a stroll up to the post office
    after tea on mail night. He doesn&rsquo;t expect any letters, but there might
    be a paper from Bill. Bill generally sends him a newspaper. They seldom write
    to each other, these old mates.</p>
  <p>There were points, of course, upon which Bill and Jim couldn&rsquo;t agree&mdash;subjects
    upon which they argued long and loud and often in the old days; and it sometimes
    happens that Bill comes across an article or a paragraph which agrees with
    and, so to speak, barracks for a pet theory of his as against one held by
    Jim; and Bill marks it with a chuckle and four crosses at the corners&mdash;and
    an extra one at each side perhaps&mdash;and sends it on to Jim; he reckons
    it&rsquo;ll rather corner old Jim. The crosses are not over ornamental nor
    artistic, but very distinct; Jim sees them from the reverse side of the sheet
    first, maybe, and turns it over with interest to see what it is. He grins
    a good-humoured grin as he reads&mdash;poor old Bill is just as thick-headed
    and obstinate as ever&mdash;just as far gone on his old fad. It&rsquo;s rather
    rough on Jim, because he&rsquo;s too far off to argue; but, if he&rsquo;s
    very earnest on the subject, he&rsquo;ll sit down and write, using all his
    old arguments to prove that the man who wrote that rot was a fool. This is
    one of the few things that will make them write to each other. Or else Jim
    will wait till he comes across a paragraph in another paper which barracks
    for his side of the argument, and, in his opinion; rather knocks the stuffing
    out of Bill&rsquo;s man; then he marks it with more and bigger crosses and
    a grin, and sends it along to Bill. They are both democrats&mdash;these old
    mates generally are&mdash;and at times one comes across a stirring article
    or poem, and marks it with approval and sends it along. Or it may be a good
    joke, or the notice of the death of an old mate. What a wave of feeling and
    memories a little par can take through the land!</p>
  <p>Jim is a sinner and a scoffer, and Bill is an earnest, thorough, respectable
    old freethinker, and consequently they often get a <i>War Cry</i> or a tract
    sent inside their exchanges&mdash;somebody puts it in for a joke.</p>
  <p>Long years ago&mdash;long years ago Bill and Jim were sweet on a rose of
    the bush&mdash;or a lily of the goldfields&mdash;call her Lily King. Both
    courted her at the same time, and quarrelled over her&mdash;fought over her,
    perhaps&mdash;and were parted by her for years. But that&rsquo;s all bygones.
    Perhaps she loved Bill, perhaps she loved Jim&mdash;perhaps both; or, maybe,
    she wasn&rsquo;t sure which. Perhaps she loved neither, and was only stringing
    them on. Anyway, she didn&rsquo;t marry either the one or the other. She
    married another man&mdash;call him Jim Smith. And so, in after years, Bill
    comes across a paragraph in a local paper, something like the following:</p>
  <p class="note">On July 10th, at her residence, Eureka Cottage, Ballarat-street,
    Tally Town, the wife of James Smith of twins (boy and girl); all
      three doing well.</p>
  <p>And Bill marks it with a loud chuckle and big crosses, and sends it along
    to Jim. Then Bill sits and thinks and smokes, and thinks till the fire goes
    out, and quite forgets all about putting that necessary patch on his pants.</p>
  <p>And away down on Auckland gum-fields, perhaps, Jim reads the par with a
    grin; then grows serious, and sits and scrapes his gum by the flickering
    firelight in a mechanical manner, and&mdash;thinks. His thoughts are far
    away in the back years&mdash;faint and far, far and faint. For the old, lingering,
    banished pain returns and hurts a man&rsquo;s heart like the false wife who
    comes back again, falls on her knees before him, and holds up her trembling
    arms and pleads with swimming, upturned eyes, which are eloquent with the
    love she felt too late.</p>
  <p>It is supposed to be something to have your work published in an English
    magazine, to have it published in book form, to be flattered by critics and
    reprinted throughout the country press, or even to be cut up well and severely.
    But, after all, now we come to think of it, we would almost as soon see a
    piece of ours marked with big inky crosses in the soiled and crumpled rag
    that Bill or Jim gets sent him by an old mate of his&mdash;the paper that
    goes thousands of miles scrawled all over with smudgy addresses and tied
    with a piece of string.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellDoesntBelieveInTheSack"></a>Mitchell Doesn&rsquo;t Believe In The Sack</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;If ever I do get a job again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    stick to it while there&rsquo;s a hand&rsquo;s turn of work to do, and put
    a few pounds together. I won&rsquo;t be the fool I always was. If I&rsquo;d
    had sense a couple of years ago, I wouldn&rsquo;t be tramping through this
    damned sand and mulga now. I&rsquo;ll get a job on a station, or at some
    toff&rsquo;s house, knocking about the stables and garden, and I&rsquo;ll
    make up my mind to settle down to graft for four or five years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing you git the sack?&rdquo; said his mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t take it. Only for taking the sack I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be hard up to-day. The boss might come round and say:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t want you after this week, Mitchell. I haven&rsquo;t
    got any more work for you to do. Come up and see me at the office presently.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll go up and get my money; but I&rsquo;ll be pottering
    round as usual on Monday, and come up to the kitchen for my breakfast. Some
    time in the day the boss&rsquo;ll be knocking round and see me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, Mitchell,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;I thought you
    was gone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t say I was going,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;Who
    told you that&mdash;or what made you think so?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I thought I told you on Saturday that I wouldn&rsquo;t want
    you any more,&rsquo;  he&rsquo;ll say, a bit short. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t
    got enough work to keep a man going; I told you that; I thought you understood. <i>Didn&rsquo;t
    I give you the sack on Saturday</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s no use;&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;that sort
    of thing&rsquo;s played out. I&rsquo;ve been had too often that way; I&rsquo;ve
    been sacked once too often. Taking the sack&rsquo;s been the cause of all
    my trouble; I don&rsquo;t believe in it. If I&rsquo;d never taken the sack
    I&rsquo;d have been a rich man to-day; it might be all very well for horses,
    but it doesn&rsquo;t suit me; it doesn&rsquo;t hurt you, but it hurts me.
    I made up my mind that when I got a place to suit me, I&rsquo;d stick in
    it. I&rsquo;m comfortable here and satisfied, and you&rsquo;ve had no cause
    to find fault with me. It&rsquo;s no use you trying to sack me, because I
    won&rsquo;t take it. I&rsquo;ve been there before, and you might as well
    try to catch an old bird with chaff.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t pay you, and you&rsquo;d better be off,&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll
    say, trying not to grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind the money,&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;the bit
    of tucker won&rsquo;t cost you anything, and I&rsquo;ll find something to
    do round the house till you have some more work. I won&rsquo;t ask you for
    anything, and, surely to God I&rsquo;ll find enough to do to pay for my grub!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll potter round and take things easy and call up at the
    kitchen as usual at meal times, and by and by the boss&rsquo;ll think to
    himself: &lsquo;Well, if I&rsquo;ve got to feed this chap I might as well
    get some work out of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;ll find me, something regular to do&mdash;a bit of fencing,
    or carpentering, or painting, or something, and then I&rsquo;ll begin to
    call up for my stuff again, as usual.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ShootingTheMoon"></a>Shooting The Moon</b></h2>
  <p>We lay in camp in the fringe of the mulga, and watched the big, red, smoky,
    rising moon out on the edge of the misty plain, and smoked and thought together
    sociably. Our nose-bags were nice and heavy, and we still had about a pound
    of nail-rod between us.</p>
  <p>The moon reminded my mate, Jack Mitchell, of something&mdash;anything reminded
    him of something, in fact.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever notice,&rdquo; said Jack, in a lazy tone, just as if
    he didn&rsquo;t want to tell a yarn&mdash;&ldquo;Did you ever notice that
    people always shoot the moon when there&rsquo;s no moon? Have you got the
    matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He lit up; he was always lighting up when he was reminded of something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This reminds me&mdash;Have you got the knife? My pipe&rsquo;s stuffed
    up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He dug it out, loaded afresh, and lit up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember once, at a pub I was staying at, I had to leave without
    saying good-bye to the landlord. I didn&rsquo;t know him very well at that
    time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My room was upstairs at the back, with the window opening on to the
    backyard. I always carried a bit of clothes-line in my swag or portmanteau
    those times. I travelled along with a portmanteau those times. I carried
    the rope in case of accident, or in case of fire, to lower my things out
    of the window&mdash;or hang myself, maybe, if things got too bad. No, now
    I come to think of it, I carried a revolver for that, and it was the only
    thing I never pawned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To hang yourself with?&rdquo; asked the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you&rsquo;re very smart,&rdquo; snapped Mitchell; &ldquo;never
    mind&mdash;. This reminds me that I got a chap at a pub to pawn my last
    suit, while I stopped inside and waited for an old mate to send me a pound;
    but I kept the shooter, and if he hadn&rsquo;t sent it I&rsquo;d have been
    the late John Mitchell long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And sometimes you lower&rsquo;d out when there wasn&rsquo;t a fire.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, that will pass; you&rsquo;re improving in the funny business.
    But about the yarn. There was two beds in my room at the pub, where I had
    to go away without shouting for the boss, and, as it happened, there was
    a strange chap sleeping in the other bed that night, and, just as I raised
    the window and was going to lower my bag out, he woke up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; I said, shaking my fist at him, like
    that, &lsquo;if you say a word, I&rsquo;ll stoush yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;well, you needn&rsquo;t be in
    such a sweat to jump down a man&rsquo;s throat. I&rsquo;ve got my swag under
    the bed, and I was just going to ask you for the loan of the rope when you&rsquo;re
    done with it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, we chummed. His name was Tom&mdash;Tom&mdash;something, I forget
    the other name, but it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Have you got the matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wasted three matches, and continued&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a lot of old galvanized iron lying about under the window,
    and I was frightened the swag would make a noise; anyway, I&rsquo;d have
    to drop the rope, and that was sure to make a noise. So we agreed for one
    of us to go down and land the swag. If we were seen going down without the
    swags it didn&rsquo;t matter, for we could say we wanted to go out in the
    yard for something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you had the swag you might pretend you were walking in your sleep,&rdquo;  I
    suggested, for the want of something funnier to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and get woke up with a black eye.
    Bushies don&rsquo;t generally carry their swags out of pubs in their sleep,
    or walk neither; it&rsquo;s only city swells who do that. Where&rsquo;s the
    blessed matches?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Tom agreed to go, and presently I saw a shadow under the window,
    and lowered away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right?&rsquo; I asked in a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rdquo; whispered the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I lowered the other swag.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said the shadow, and just then the moon
    came out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says the shadow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t all right. It was the landlord himself!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It seems he got up and went out to the back in the night, and just
    happened to be coming in when my mate Tom was sneaking out of the back door.
    He saw Tom, and Tom saw him, and smoked through a hole in the palings into
    the scrub. The boss looked up at the window, and dropped to it. I went down,
    funky enough, I can tell you, and faced him. He said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, mate, why didn&rsquo;t you come straight to me,
    and tell me how you was fixed, instead of sneaking round the trouble in that
    fashion? There&rsquo;s no occasion for it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I felt mean at once, but I said: &lsquo;Well, you see, we didn&rsquo;t
    know you, boss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So it seems. Well, I didn&rsquo;t think of that. Anyway, call
    up your mate and come and have a drink; we&rsquo;ll talk over it afterwards.&rsquo; So
    I called Tom. &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; I shouted. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the boss kept us a couple of days, and then gave us as much tucker
    as we could carry, and a drop of stuff and a few bob to go on the track again
    with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he was white, any road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I knew him well after that, and only heard one man say a word
    against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you stoush him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I was going to, but Tom wouldn&rsquo;t let me. He said he was
    frightened I might make a mess of it, and he did it himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did what? Make a mess of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made a mess of the other man that slandered that publican. I&rsquo;d
    be funny if I was you. Where&rsquo;s the matches?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And could Tom fight?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Tom could fight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you travel long with him after that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dead&mdash;Give us the matches.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisFathersMate"></a>His Father&rsquo;s Mate</b></h2>
  <p>It was Golden Gully still, but golden in name only, unless indeed the yellow
    mullock heaps or the bloom of the wattle-trees on the hillside gave it a
    claim to the title. But the gold was gone from the gully, and the diggers
    were gone, too, after the manner of Timon&rsquo;s friends when his wealth
    deserted him. Golden Gully was a dreary place, dreary even for an abandoned
    goldfield. The poor, tortured earth, with its wounds all bare, seemed to
    make a mute appeal to the surrounding bush to come up and hide it, and, as
    if in answer to its appeal, the shrub and saplings were beginning to close
    in from the foot of the range. The wilderness was reclaiming its own again.</p>
  <p>The two dark, sullen hills that stood on each side were clothed from tip
    to hollow with dark scrub and scraggy box-trees; but above the highest row
    of shafts on one side ran a line of wattle-trees in full bloom.</p>
  <p>The top of the western hill was shaped somewhat like a saddle, and standing
    high above the eucalypti on the point corresponding with the pommel were
    three tall pines. These lonely trees, seen for many miles around, had caught
    the yellow rays of many a setting sun long before the white man wandered
    over the ranges.</p>
  <p>The predominant note of the scene was a painful sense of listening, that
    never seemed to lose its tension&mdash;a listening as though for the sounds
    of digger life, sounds that had gone and left a void that was accentuated
    by the signs of a former presence. The main army of diggers had long ago
    vanished to new rushes, leaving only its stragglers and deserters behind.
    These were men who were too poor to drag families about, men who were old
    and feeble, and men who had lost their faith in fortune. They had dropped
    unnoticed out of the ranks; and remained to scratch out a living among the
    abandoned claims.</p>
  <p>Golden Gully had its little community of fossickers who lived in a clearing
    called Spencer&rsquo;s Flat on one side and Pounding Flat on the other, but
    they lent no life to the scene; they only haunted it. A stranger might have
    thought the field entirely deserted until he came on a coat and a billy at
    the foot of saplings amongst the holes, and heard, in the shallow ground
    underneath, the thud of a pick, which told of some fossicker below rooting
    out what little wash remained.</p>
  <p>One afternoon towards Christmas, a windlass was erected over an old shaft
    of considerable depth at the foot of the gully. A greenhide bucket attached
    to a rope on the windlass was lying next morning near the mouth of the shaft,
    and beside it, on a clear-swept patch, was a little mound of cool wet wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>A clump of saplings near at hand threw a shade over part of the mullock
    heap, and in this shade, seated on an old coat, was a small boy of eleven
    or twelve years, writing on a slate.</p>
  <p>He had fair hair, blue eyes, and a thin old-fashioned face&mdash;a face
    that would scarcely alter as he grew to manhood. His costume consisted of
    a pair of moleskin trousers, a cotton shirt, and one suspender. He held the
    slate rigidly with a corner of its frame pressed close against his ribs,
    whilst his head hung to one side, so close to the slate that his straggling
    hair almost touched it. He was regarding his work fixedly out of the corners
    of his eyes, whilst he painfully copied down the head line, spelling it in
    a different way each time. In this laborious task he appeared to be greatly
    assisted by a tongue that lolled out of the corner of his mouth and made
    an occasional revolution round it, leaving a circle of temporarily clean
    face. His small clay-covered toes also entered into the spirit of the thing,
    and helped him not a little by their energetic wriggling. He paused occasionally
    to draw the back of his small brown arm across his mouth.</p>
  <p>Little Isley Mason, or, as he was called, &ldquo;His Father&rsquo;s Mate,&rdquo; had
    always been a favourite with the diggers and fossickers from the days when
    he used to slip out first thing in the morning and take a run across the
    frosty flat in his shirt. Long Bob Sawkins would often tell how Isley came
    home one morning from his run in the long, wet grass as naked as he was born,
    with the information that he had lost his shirt.</p>
  <p>Later on, when most of the diggers had gone, and Isley&rsquo;s mother was
    dead, he was to be seen about the place with bare, sunbrowned arms and legs,
    a pick and shovel, and a gold dish about two-thirds of his height in diameter,
    with which he used to go &ldquo;a-speckin&rsquo;&rdquo; and &ldquo;fossickin&rsquo;&rdquo; amongst
    the old mullock heaps. Long Bob was Isley&rsquo;s special crony, and he would
    often go out of his way to lay the boy outer bits o&rsquo; wash and likely
    spots, lamely excusing his long yarns with the child by the explanation that
    it was &ldquo;amusin&rsquo; to draw Isley out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley had been sitting writing for some time when a deep voice called out
    from below:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send down the bucket.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley put down his slate, and going to the shaft dropped the bucket down
    as far as the slack rope reached; then, placing one hand on the bole of the
    windlass and holding the other against it underneath, he let it slip round
    between his palms until the bucket reached bottom. A sound of shovelling
    was heard for a few moments, and presently the voice cried, &ldquo;Wind away,
    sonny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet ain&rsquo;t half enough,&rdquo; said the boy, peering down. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    be frightened to pile it in, father. I kin wind up a lot more&rsquo;n thet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A little more scraping, and the boy braced his feet well upon the little
    mound of clay which he had raised under the handle of the windlass to make
    up for his deficiency in stature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Isley wound slowly but sturdily, and soon the bucket of &ldquo;wash&rdquo; appeared
    above the surface; then he took it in short lifts and deposited it with the
    rest of the wash-dirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; called his father again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you done that writing lesson yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very near.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then send down the slate next time for some sums.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy resumed his seat, fixed the corner of the slate well into his ribs,
    humped his back, and commenced another wavering line.</p>
  <p>Tom Mason was known on the place as a silent, hard worker. He was a man
    of about sixty, tall, and dark bearded. There was nothing uncommon about
    his face, except, perhaps, that it hardened, as the face of a man might harden
    who had suffered a long succession of griefs and disappointments. He lived
    in a little hut under a peppermint tree at the far edge of Pounding Flat.
    His wife had died there about six years before, and new rushes broke out
    and he was well able to go, he never left Golden Gully.</p>
  <p>Mason was kneeling in front of the &ldquo;face&rdquo; digging away by the
    light of a tallow candle stuck in the side. The floor of the drive was very
    wet, and his trousers were heavy and cold with clay and water; but the old
    digger was used to this sort of thing. His pick was not bringing out much
    to-day, however, for he seemed abstracted and would occasionally pause in
    his work, while his thoughts wandered far away from the narrow streak of
    wash-dirt in the &ldquo;face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was digging out pictures from a past life. They were not pleasant ones,
    for his face was stony and white in the dim glow of the candle.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud&mdash;the blows became slower and more irregular as the
    fossicker&rsquo;s mind wandered off into the past. The sides of the drive
    seemed to vanish slowly away, and the &ldquo;face&rdquo; retreated far out
    beyond a horizon that was hazy in the glow of the southern ocean. He was
    standing on the deck of a ship and by his side stood a brother. They were
    sailing southward to the Land of Promise that was shining there in all its
    golden glory! The sails pressed forward in the bracing wind, and the clipper
    ship raced along with its burden of the wildest dreamers ever borne in a
    vessel&rsquo;s hull! Up over long blue ocean ridges, down into long blue
    ocean gullies; on to lands so new, and yet so old, where above the sunny
    glow of the southern skies blazed the shining names of Ballarat! and Bendigo!
    The deck seemed to lurch, and the fossicker fell forward against the face
    of the drive. The shock recalled him, and he lifted his pick once more.</p>
  <p>But the blows slacken again as another vision rises before him. It is Ballarat
    now. He is working in a shallow claim at Eureka, his brother by his side.
    The brother looks pale and ill, for he has been up all night dancing and
    drinking. Out behind them is the line of blue hills; in front is the famous
    Bakery Hill, and down to the left Golden Point. Two mounted troopers are
    riding up over Specimen Hill. What do they want?</p>
  <p>They take the brother away, handcuffed. Manslaughter last night. Cause&mdash;drink
    and jealousy.</p>
  <p>The vision is gone again. Thud, thud, goes the pick; it counts the years
    that follow&mdash;one, two, three, four, up to twenty, and then it stops
    for the next scene&mdash;a selection on the banks of a bright river in New
    South Wales. The little homestead is surrounded by vines and fruit-trees.
    Many swarms of bees work under the shade of the trees, and a crop of wheat
    is nearly ripe on the hillside.</p>
  <p>A man and a boy are engaged in clearing a paddock just below the homestead.
    They are father and son; the son, a boy of about seventeen, is the image
    of his father.</p>
  <p>Horses&rsquo; feet again! Here comes Nemesis in mounted troopers&rsquo; uniform.</p>
  <p>The mail was stuck up last night about five miles away, and a refractory
    passenger shot. The son had been out &rsquo;possum shooting&rsquo; all night
    with some friends.</p>
  <p>The troopers take the son away handcuffed: &ldquo;Robbery under arms.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The father was taking out a stump when the troopers came. His foot is still
    resting on the spade, which is half driven home. He watches the troopers
    take the boy up to the house, and then, driving the spade to its full depth,
    he turns up another sod. The troopers reach the door of the homestead; but
    still he digs steadily, and does not seem to hear his wife&rsquo;s cry of
    despair. The troopers search the boy&rsquo;s room and bring out some clothing
    in two bundles; but still the father digs. They have saddled up one of the
    farm horses and made the boy mount. The father digs. They ride off along
    the ridge with the boy between them. The father never lifts his eyes; the
    hole widens round the stump; he digs away till the brave little wife comes
    and takes him gently by the arm. He half rouses himself and follows her to
    the house like an obedient dog.</p>
  <p>Trial and disgrace follow, and then other misfortunes, pleuro among the
    cattle, drought, and poverty.</p>
  <p>Thud, thud, thud again! But it is not the sound of the fossicker&rsquo;s
    pick&mdash;it is the fall of sods on his wife&rsquo;s coffin.</p>
  <p>It is a little bush cemetery, and he stands stonily watching them fill up
    her grave. She died of a broken heart and shame. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear
    disgrace! I can&rsquo;t bear disgrace!&rdquo; she had moaned all these six
    weary years&mdash;for the poor are often proud.</p>
  <p>But he lives on, for it takes a lot to break a man&rsquo;s heart. He holds
    up his head and toils on for the sake of a child that is left, and that child
    is&mdash;Isley.</p>
  <p>And now the fossicker seems to see a vision of the future. He seems to be
    standing somewhere, an old, old man, with a younger one at his side; the
    younger one has Isley&rsquo;s face. Horses&rsquo; feet again! Ah, God! Nemesis
    once more in troopers&rsquo;  uniform!</p>
  <p>The fossicker falls on his knees in the mud and clay at the bottom of the
    drive, and prays Heaven to take his last child ere Nemesis comes for him.</p>
  <p>Long Bob Sawkins had been known on the diggings as &ldquo;Bob the Devil.&rdquo;  His
    profile at least from one side, certainly did recall that of the sarcastic
    Mephistopheles; but the other side, like his true character, was by no means
    a devil&rsquo;s. His physiognomy had been much damaged, and one eye removed
    by the premature explosion of a blast in some old Ballarat mine. The blind
    eye was covered with a green patch, which gave a sardonic appearance to the
    remaining features.</p>
  <p>He was a stupid, heavy, good-natured Englishman. He stuttered a little,
    and had a peculiar habit of wedging the monosyllable &ldquo;why&rdquo; into
    his conversation at times when it served no other purpose than to fill up
    the pauses caused by his stuttering; but this by no means assisted him in
    his speech, for he often stuttered over the &ldquo;why&rdquo; itself.</p>
  <p>The sun was getting low down, and its yellow rays reached far up among the
    saplings of Golden Gully when Bob appeared coming down by the path that ran
    under the western hill. He was dressed in the usual costume-cotton shirt,
    moleskin trousers, faded hat and waistcoat, and blucher boots. He carried
    a pick over his shoulder, the handle of which was run through the heft of
    a short shovel that hung down behind, and he had a big dish under his arm.
    He paused opposite the shaft with the windlass, and hailed the boy in his
    usual form of salutation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look, see here Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Bob?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seed a young&mdash;why&mdash;magpie up in the scrub, and yer oughter
    be able to catch it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t leave the shaft; father&rsquo;s b&rsquo;low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did yer father know there was any&mdash;why&mdash;wash in the
    old shaft?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seed old Corney in town Saturday, &rsquo;n he said thur was enough
    to make it worth while bailin&rsquo; out. Bin bailin&rsquo; all the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob came over, and letting his tools down with a clatter he hitched up the
    knees of his moleskins and sat down on one heel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are yer&mdash;why&mdash;doin&rsquo; on the slate, Isley?&rdquo; said
    he, taking out an old clay pipe and lighting it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sums,&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>Bob puffed away at his pipe a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t no use!&rdquo; he said, sitting down on the clay
    and drawing his knees up. &ldquo;Edication&rsquo;s a failyer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Listen at &rsquo;im!&rdquo; exclaimed the boy. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yer
    mean ter say it ain&rsquo;t no use learnin&rsquo; readin&rsquo; and writin&rsquo; and
    sums?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right, father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy went to the windlass and let the bucket down. Bob offered to help
    him wind up, but Isley, proud of showing his strength to his friend, insisted
    on winding by himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be&mdash;why&mdash;a strong man some day, Isley,&rdquo; said
    Bob, landing the bucket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I could wind up a lot more&rsquo;n father puts in. Look how I
    greased the handles! It works like butter now,&rdquo; and the boy sent the
    handles spinning round with a jerk to illustrate his meaning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why did they call yer Isley for?&rdquo; queried Bob, as they resumed
    their seats. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t yer real name, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, my name&rsquo;s Harry. A digger useter say I was a isle in the
    ocean to father &rsquo;n mother, &rsquo;n then I was nicknamed Isle, &rsquo;n
    then Isley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You hed a&mdash;why&mdash;brother once, didn&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, but thet was afore I was borned. He died, at least mother used
    ter say she didn&rsquo;t know if he was dead; but father says he&rsquo;s
    dead as fur&rsquo;s he&rsquo;s concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And your father hed a brother, too. Did yer ever&mdash;why&mdash;hear
    of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard father talkin&rsquo; about it wonst to mother. I think
    father&rsquo;s brother got into some row in a bar where a man was killed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was yer&mdash;why&mdash;father&mdash;why&mdash;fond of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard father say that he was wonst, but thet was all past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob smoked in silence for a while, and seemed to look at some dark clouds
    that were drifting along like a funeral out in the west. Presently he said
    half aloud something that sounded like &ldquo;All, all&mdash;why&mdash;past.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; said Isley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s&mdash;why, why&mdash;nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; answered
    Bob, rousing himself. &ldquo;Is that a paper in yer father&rsquo;s coat-pocket,
    Isley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the boy, taking it out.</p>
  <p>Bob took the paper and stared hard at it for a moment or so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something about the new goldfields there,&rdquo; said
    Bob, putting his finger on a tailor&rsquo;s advertisement. &ldquo;I wish
    you&rsquo;d&mdash;why&mdash;read it to me, Isley; I can&rsquo;t see the small
    print they uses nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thet&rsquo;s not it,&rdquo; said the boy, taking the paper, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    something about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isley!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Old on, Bob, father wants me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy ran to the shaft, rested his hands and forehead against the bole
    of the windlass, and leant over to hear what his father was saying.</p>
  <p>Without a moment&rsquo;s warning the treacherous bole slipped round; a small
    body bounded a couple of times against the sides of the shaft and fell at
    Mason&rsquo;s feet, where it lay motionless!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mason!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put him in the bucket and lash him to the rope with your belt!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few moments, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob&rsquo;s trembling hands would scarcely grasp the handle, but he managed
    to wind somehow.</p>
  <p>Presently the form of the child appeared, motionless and covered with clay
    and water. Mason was climbing up by the steps in the side of the shaft.</p>
  <p>Bob tenderly unlashed the boy and laid him under the saplings on the grass;
    then he wiped some of the clay and blood away from the child&rsquo;s forehead,
    and dashed over him some muddy water.</p>
  <p>Presently Isley gave a gasp and opened his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are yer&mdash;why&mdash;hurt much, Isley?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ba-back&rsquo;s bruk, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so bad as that, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Coming up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Silence awhile, and then&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! father! be quick, father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mason reached the surface and came and knelt by the other side of the boy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;why&mdash;run fur some brandy,&rdquo; said
    Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No use, Bob,&rdquo; said Isley. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all bruk up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yer feel better, sonny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;goin&rsquo; to&mdash;die, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, Isley,&rdquo; groaned Bob.</p>
  <p>A short silence, and then the boy&rsquo;s body suddenly twisted with pain.
    But it was soon over. He lay still awhile, and then said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob made a vain attempt to speak. &ldquo;Isley!&rdquo; he said,&rdquo;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The child turned and stretched out his hands to the silent, stony-faced
    man on the other side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father&mdash;father, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shuddering groan broke from Mason&rsquo;s lips, and then all was quiet.</p>
  <p>Bob had taken off his hat to wipe his, forehead, and his face, in spite
    of its disfigurement, was strangely like the face of the stone-like man opposite.</p>
  <p>For a moment they looked at one another across the body of the child, and
    then Bob said quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never knowed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; said Mason gruffly; and, taking up the
    dead child, he walked towards the hut.</p>
  <p>It was a very sad little group that gathered outside Mason&rsquo;s hut next
    morning. Martin&rsquo;s wife had been there all the morning cleaning up and
    doing what she could. One of the women had torn up her husband&rsquo;s only
    white shirt for a shroud, and they had made the little body look clean and
    even beautiful in the wretched little hut.</p>
  <p>One after another the fossickers took off their hats and entered, stooping
    through the low door. Mason sat silently at the foot of the bunk with his
    head supported by his hand, and watched the men with a strange, abstracted
    air.</p>
  <p>Bob had ransacked the camp in search of some boards for a coffin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will be the last I&rsquo;ll be able to&mdash;why&mdash;do for
    him,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>At last he came to Mrs Martin in despair. That lady took him into the dining-room,
    and pointed to a large pine table, of which she was very proud.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Knock that table to pieces,&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>Taking off the few things that were lying on it, Bob turned it over and
    began to knock the top off.</p>
  <p>When he had finished the coffin one of the fossicker&rsquo;s wives said
    it looked too bare, and she ripped up her black riding-skirt, and made Bob
    tack the cloth over the coffin.</p>
  <p>There was only one vehicle available in the place, and that was Martin&rsquo;s
    old dray; so about two o&rsquo;clock Pat Martin attached his old horse Dublin
    to the shafts with sundry bits of harness and plenty of old rope, and dragged
    Dublin, dray and all, across to Mason&rsquo;s hut.</p>
  <p>The little coffin was carried out, and two gin-cases were placed by its
    side in the dray to serve as seats for Mrs Martin and Mrs Grimshaw, who mounted
    in tearful silence.</p>
  <p>Pat Martin felt for his pipe, but remembered himself and mounted on the
    shaft. Mason fastened up the door of the hut with a padlock. A couple of
    blows on one of his sharp points roused Dublin from his reverie. With a lurch
    to the right and another to the left he started, and presently the little
    funeral disappeared down the road that led to the &ldquo;town&rdquo; and
    its cemetery.</p>
  <p>About six months afterwards Bob Sawkins went on a short journey, and returned
    with a tall, bearded young man. He and Bob arrived after dark, and went straight
    to Mason&rsquo;s hut. There was a light inside, but when Bob knocked there
    was no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go in; don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said to his companion.</p>
  <p>The stranger pushed open the creaking door, and stood bareheaded just inside
    the doorway.</p>
  <p>A billy was boiling unheeded on the fire. Mason sat at the table with his
    face buried in his arms.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, but the flickering of the firelight made the stranger
    think he could detect an impatient shrug in Mason&rsquo;s shoulders.</p>
  <p>For a moment the stranger paused irresolute, and then stepping up to the
    table he laid his hand on Mason&rsquo;s arm, and said gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! Do you want another mate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the sleeper did not&mdash;at least, not in this world.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnEchoFromTheOldBarkSchool"></a>An Echo From The Old Bark School</b></h2>
  <p>It was the first Monday after the holidays. The children had taken their
    seats in the Old Bark School, and the master called out the roll as usual:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie Aspinall.&rdquo;... &ldquo;&rsquo;Es, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David Cooper.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;John Heegard.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yezzer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joseph Swallow.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yesser.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James Bullock.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frederick Swallow.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Y&rsquo;sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;James Nowlett.&rdquo;... . (Chorus of &ldquo;Absent.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;William Atkins.&rdquo;... (Chorus of &ldquo;Absent.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daniel Lyons.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Perresent, sor-r-r.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dan was a young immigrant, just out from the sod, and rolled his &ldquo;r&rsquo;s&rdquo;  like
    a cock-dove. His brogue was rich enough to make an Irishman laugh.</p>
  <p>Bill was &ldquo;wagging it.&rdquo; His own especial chum was of the opinion
    that Bill was sick. The master&rsquo;s opinion did not coincide, so he penned
    a note to William&rsquo;s parents, to be delivered by the model boy of the
    school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bertha Lambert.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, &rsquo;air.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May Carey.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Pesin&rsquo;, sair.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rose Cooper.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Janet Wild.&rdquo;... &ldquo;Y-y-yes, s-sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary Wild.&rdquo;...</p>
  <p>A solemn hush fell upon the school, and presently Janet Wild threw her arms
    out on the desk before her, let her face fall on them, and sobbed heart-brokenly.
    The master saw his mistake too late; he gave his head a little half-affirmative,
    half-negative movement, in that pathetic old way of his; rested his head
    on one hand, gazed sadly at the name, and sighed.</p>
  <p>But the galoot of the school spoilt the pathos of it all, for, during the
    awed silence which followed the calling of the girl&rsquo;s name, he suddenly
    brightened up&mdash;the first time he was ever observed to do so during school
    hours&mdash;and said, briskly and cheerfully &ldquo;Dead&mdash;sir!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He hadn&rsquo;t been able to answer a question correctly for several days.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Children,&rdquo; said the master gravely and sadly, &ldquo;children,
    this is the first time I ever had to put &lsquo;D&rsquo; to the name of one
    of my scholars. Poor Mary! she was one of my first pupils&mdash;came the
    first morning the school was opened. Children, I want you to be a little
    quieter to-day during play-hour, out of respect for the name of your dead
    schoolmate whom it has pleased the Almighty to take in her youth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Please, sir,&rdquo; asked the galoot, evidently encouraged by his
    fancied success, &ldquo;please, sir, what does &lsquo;D&rsquo; stand for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn you for a hass!&rdquo; snarled Jim Bullock between his teeth,
    giving the galoot a vicious dig in the side with his elbow.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearingOfTheCooksDog"></a>The Shearing Of The Cook&rsquo;s Dog</b></h2>
  <p>The dog was a little conservative mongrel poodle, with long dirty white
    hair all over him&mdash;longest and most over his eyes, which glistened through
    it like black beads. Also he seemed to have a bad liver. He always looked
    as if he was suffering from a sense of injury, past or to come. It did come.
    He used to follow the shearers up to the shed after breakfast every morning,
    but he couldn&rsquo;t have done this for love&mdash;there was none lost between
    him and the men. He wasn&rsquo;t an affectionate dog; it wasn&rsquo;t his
    style. He would sit close against the shed for an hour or two, and hump himself,
    and sulk, and look sick, and snarl whenever the &ldquo;Sheep-Ho&rdquo; dog
    passed, or a man took notice of him. Then he&rsquo;d go home. What he wanted
    at the shed at all was only known to himself; no one asked him to come. Perhaps
    he came to collect evidence against us. The cook called him &ldquo;my darg,&rdquo; and
    the men called the cook  &ldquo;Curry and Rice,&rdquo; with &ldquo;old&rdquo; before
    it mostly.</p>
  <p>Rice was a little, dumpy, fat man, with a round, smooth, good-humoured face,
    a bald head, feet wide apart, and a big blue cotton apron. He had been a
    ship&rsquo;s cook. He didn&rsquo;t look so much out of place in the hut as
    the hut did round him. To a man with a vivid imagination, if he regarded
    the cook dreamily for a while, the floor might seem to roll gently like the
    deck of a ship, and mast, rigging, and cuddy rise mistily in the background.
    Curry might have dreamed of the cook&rsquo;s galley at times, but he never
    mentioned it. He ought to have been at sea, or comfortably dead and stowed
    away under ground, instead of cooking for a mob of unredeemed rouseabouts
    in an uncivilized shed in the scrub, six hundred miles from the ocean.</p>
  <p>They chyacked the cook occasionally, and grumbled&mdash;or pretended to
    grumble&mdash;about their tucker, and then he&rsquo;d make a roughly pathetic
    speech, with many references to his age, and the hardness of his work, and
    the smallness of his wages, and the inconsiderateness of the men. Then the
    joker of the shed would sympathize with the cook with his tongue and one
    side of his face&mdash;and joke with the other.</p>
  <p>One day in the shed, during smoke-ho the devil whispered to a shearer named
    Geordie that it would be a lark to shear the cook&rsquo;s dog&mdash;the Evil
    One having previously arranged that the dog should be there, sitting close
    to Geordie&rsquo;s pen, and that the shearer should have a fine lamb comb
    on his machine. The idea was communicated through Geordie to his mates, and
    met with entire and general approval; and for five or ten minutes the air
    was kept alive by shouting and laughter of the men, and the protestations
    of the dog. When the shearer touched skin, he yelled &ldquo;Tar!&rdquo;  and
    when he finished he shouted &ldquo;Wool away!&rdquo; at the top of his voice,
    and his mates echoed him with a will. A picker-up gathered the fleece with
    a great show of labour and care, and tabled it, to the well-ventilated disgust
    of old Scotty, the wool-roller. When they let the dog go he struck for home&mdash;a
    clean-shaven poodle, except for a ferocious moustache and a tuft at the end
    of his tail.</p>
  <p>The cook&rsquo;s assistant said that he&rsquo;d have given a five-pound
    note for a portrait of Curry-and-Rice when that poodle came back from the
    shed. The cook was naturally very indignant; he was surprised at first&mdash;then
    he got mad. He had the whole afternoon to get worked up in, and at tea-time
    he went for the men properly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wotter yer growlin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; asked one. &ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s
    the matter with yer, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nothing about yer dog!&rdquo; protested a rouseabout; &ldquo;wotyer
    gettin&rsquo; on to me for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wotter they bin doin&rsquo; to the cook now?&rdquo; inquired a ring
    leader innocently, as he sprawled into his place at the table. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    yer let Curry alone? Wot d&rsquo;yer want to be chyackin&rsquo; him for?
    Give it a rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here, chaps,&rdquo; observed Geordie, in a determined
    tone, &ldquo;I call it a shame, that&rsquo;s what I call it. Why couldn&rsquo;t
    you leave an old man&rsquo;s dog alone? It was a mean, dirty trick to do,
    and I suppose you thought it funny. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,
    the whole lot of you, for a drafted mob of crawlers. If I&rsquo;d been there
    it wouldn&rsquo;t have been done; and I wouldn&rsquo;t blame Curry if he
    was to poison the whole convicted push.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>General lowering of faces and pulling of hats down over eyes, and great
    working of knives and forks; also sounds like men trying not to laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you play a trick on another man&rsquo;s darg?&rdquo; said
    Curry.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use tellin&rsquo; me. I can see it all as plain
    as if I was on the board&mdash;all of you runnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; shoutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cheerin&rsquo; an&rsquo; laughin&rsquo;,
    and all over shearin&rsquo; and ill-usin&rsquo; a poor little darg! Why couldn&rsquo;t
    you play a trick on another man&rsquo;s darg?... It doesn&rsquo;t matter
    much&mdash;I&rsquo;m nearly done cookie&rsquo; here now.... Only that I&rsquo;ve
    got a family to think of I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; stayed so long.
    I&rsquo;ve got to be up at five every mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t
    get to bed till ten at night, cookin&rsquo; an&rsquo; bakin&rsquo; an&rsquo; cleanin&rsquo;  for
    you an&rsquo; waitin&rsquo; on you. First one lot in from the wool-wash,
    an&rsquo; then one lot in from the shed, an&rsquo; another lot in, an&rsquo; at
    all hours an&rsquo; times, an&rsquo; all wantin&rsquo;  their meals kept
    hot, an&rsquo; then they ain&rsquo;t satisfied. And now you must go an&rsquo; play
    a dirty trick on my darg! Why couldn&rsquo;t you have a lark with some other
    man&rsquo;s darg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Geordie bowed his head and ate as though he had a cud, like a cow, and could
    chew at leisure. He seemed ashamed, as indeed we all were&mdash;secretly.
    Poor old Curry&rsquo;s oft-repeated appeal, &ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t you
    play a trick with another man&rsquo;s dog?&rdquo; seemed to have something
    pathetic about it. The men didn&rsquo;t notice that it lacked philanthropy
    and logic, and probably the cook didn&rsquo;t notice it either, else he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have harped on it. Geordie lowered his face, and just then, as luck or the
    devil would have it, he caught sight of the dog. Then he exploded.</p>
  <p>The cook usually forgot all about it in an hour, and then, if you asked
    him what the chaps had been doing, he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Oh, nothing! nothing!
    Only their larks!&rdquo;  But this time he didn&rsquo;t; he was narked for
    three days, and the chaps marvelled much and were sorry, and treated him
    with great respect and consideration. They hadn&rsquo;t thought he&rsquo;d
    take it so hard&mdash;the dog shearing business&mdash;else they wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done it. They were a little puzzled too, and getting a trifle angry,
    and would shortly be prepared to take the place of the injured party, and
    make things unpleasant for the cook. However, he brightened up towards the
    end of the week, and then it all came out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; minded so much,&rdquo; he said,
    standing by the table with a dipper in one hand, a bucket in the other, and
    a smile on his face. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t  &rsquo;a&rsquo; minded so much
    only they&rsquo;ll think me a flash man in Bourke with that theer darg trimmed
    up like that!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DossingOutAndCamping"></a>&ldquo;Dossing Out&rdquo; And &ldquo;Camping&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>At least two hundred poor beggars were counted sleeping out on the pavements
    of the main streets of Sydney the other night&mdash;grotesque bundles of
    rags lying under the verandas of the old Fruit Markets and York Street shops,
    with their heads to the wall and their feet to the gutter. It was raining
    and cold that night, and the unemployed had been driven in from Hyde Park
    and the bleak Domain&mdash;from dripping trees, damp seats, and drenched
    grass&mdash;from the rain, and cold, and the wind. Some had sheets of old
    newspapers to cover them&mdash;and some hadn&rsquo;t. Two were mates, and
    they divided a <i>Herald</i> between them. One had a sheet of brown paper,
    and another (lucky man!) had a bag&mdash;the only bag there. They all shrank
    as far into their rags as possible&mdash;and tried to sleep. The rats seemed
    to take them for rubbish, too, and only scampered away when one of the outcasts
    moved uneasily, or coughed, or groaned&mdash;or when a policeman came along.</p>
  <p>One or two rose occasionally and rooted in the dust-boxes on the pavement
    outside the shops&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t seem to get anything. They
    were feeling &ldquo;peckish,&rdquo;  no doubt, and wanted to see if they
    could get something to eat before the corporation carts came along. So did
    the rats.</p>
  <p>Some men can&rsquo;t sleep very well on an empty stomach&mdash;at least,
    not at first; but it mostly comes with practice. They often sleep for ever
    in London. Not in Sydney as yet&mdash;so we say.</p>
  <p>Now and then one of our outcasts would stretch his cramped limbs to ease
    them&mdash;but the cold soon made him huddle again. The pavement must have
    been hard on the men&rsquo;s &ldquo;points,&rdquo; too; they couldn&rsquo;t
    dig holes nor make soft places for their hips, as you can in camp out back.
    And then, again, the stones had nasty edges and awkward slopes, for the pavements
    were very uneven.</p>
  <p>The Law came along now and then, and had a careless glance at the unemployed
    in bed. They didn&rsquo;t look like sleeping beauties. The Law appeared to
    regard them as so much rubbish that ought not to have been placed there,
    and for the presence of which somebody ought to be prosecuted by the Inspector
    of Nuisances. At least, that was the expression the policeman had on his
    face.</p>
  <p>And so Australian workmen lay at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning in the
    streets of Sydney, and tried to get a little sleep before the traffic came
    along and took their bed.</p>
  <p>The idea of sleeping out might be nothing to bushmen&mdash;not even an idea;
    but &ldquo;dossing out&rdquo; in the city and &ldquo;camping&rdquo; in the
    bush are two very different things. In the bush you can light a fire, boil
    your billy, and make some tea&mdash;if you have any; also fry a chop (there
    are no sheep running round in the city). You can have a clean meal, take
    off your shirt and wash it, and wash yourself&mdash;if there&rsquo;s water
    enough&mdash;and feel fresh and clean. You can whistle and sing by the camp-fire,
    and make poetry, and breathe fresh air, and watch the everlasting stars that
    keep the mateless traveller from going mad as he lies in his lonely camp
    on the plains. Your privacy is even more perfect than if you had a suite
    of rooms at the Australia; you are at the mercy of no policeman; there&rsquo;s
    no one to watch you but God&mdash;and He won&rsquo;t move you on. God watches
    the &ldquo;dossers-out,&rdquo; too, in the city, but He doesn&rsquo;t keep
    them from being moved on or run in.</p>
  <p>With the city unemployed the case is entirely different. The city outcast
    cannot light a fire and boil a billy&mdash;even if he has one&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    be run in at once for attempting to commit arson, or create a riot, or on
    suspicion of being a person of unsound mind. If he took off his shirt to
    wash it, or went in for a swim, he&rsquo;d be had up for indecently exposing
    his bones&mdash;and perhaps he&rsquo;d get flogged. He cannot whistle or
    sing on his pavement bed at night, for, if he did, he&rsquo;d be violently
    arrested by two great policemen for riotous conduct. He doesn&rsquo;t see
    many stars, and he&rsquo;s generally too hungry to make poetry. He only sleeps
    on the pavement on sufferance, and when the policeman finds the small hours
    hang heavily on him, he can root up the unemployed with his big foot and
    move him on&mdash;or arrest him for being around with the intention to commit
    a felony; and, when the wretched &ldquo;dosser&rdquo; rises in the morning,
    he cannot shoulder his swag and take the track&mdash;he must cadge a breakfast
    at some back gate or restaurant, and then sit in the park or walk round and
    round, the same old hopeless round, all day. There&rsquo;s no prison like
    the city for a poor man.</p>
  <p>Nearly every man the traveller meets in the bush is about as dirty and ragged
    as himself, and just about as hard up; but in the city nearly every man the
    poor unemployed meets is a dude, or at least, well dressed, and the unemployed <i>feels</i> dirty
    and mean and degraded by the contrast&mdash;and despised.</p>
  <p>And he can&rsquo;t help feeling like a criminal. It may be imagination,
    but every policeman seems to regard him with suspicion, and this is terrible
    to a sensitive man.</p>
  <p>We once had the key of the street for a night. We don&rsquo;t know how much
    tobacco we smoked, how many seats we sat on, or how many miles we walked
    before morning. But we do know that we felt like a felon, and that every
    policeman seemed to regard us with a suspicious eye; and at last we began
    to squint furtively at every trap we met, which, perhaps, made him more suspicious,
    till finally we felt bad enough to be run in and to get six months&rsquo; hard.</p>
  <p>Three winters ago a man, whose name doesn&rsquo;t matter, had a small office
    near Elizabeth Street, Sydney. He was an hotel broker, debt collector, commission
    agent, canvasser, and so on, in a small way&mdash;a very small way&mdash;but
    his heart was big. He had a partner. They batched in the office, and did
    their cooking over a gas lamp. Now, every day the man-whose-name-doesn&rsquo;t-matter
    would carefully collect the scraps of food, add a slice or two of bread and
    butter, wrap it all up in a piece of newspaper, and, after dark, step out
    and leave the parcel on a ledge of the stonework outside the building in
    the street. Every morning it would be gone. A shadow came along in the night
    and took it. This went on for many months, till at last one night the man-whose-name-doesn&rsquo;t-matter
    forgot to put the parcel out, and didn&rsquo;t think of it till he was in
    bed. It worried him, so that at last he had to get up and put the scraps
    outside. It was midnight. He felt curious to see the shadow, so he waited
    until it came along. It wasn&rsquo;t his long-lost brother, but it was an
    old mate of his.</p>
  <p>Let us finish with a sketch:</p>
  <p>The scene was Circular Quay, outside the Messageries sheds. The usual number
    of bundles of misery&mdash;covered more or less with dirty sheets of newspaper&mdash;lay
    along the wall under the ghastly glare of the electric light. Time&mdash;shortly
    after midnight. From among the bundles an old man sat up. He cautiously drew
    off his pants, and then stood close to the wall, in his shirt, tenderly examining
    the seat of the trousers. Presently he shook them out, folded them with great
    care, wrapped them in a scrap of newspaper, and laid them down where his
    head was to be. He had thin, hairy legs and a long grey beard. From a bundle
    of rags he extracted another pair of pants, which were all patches and tatters,
    and into which he engineered his way with great caution. Then he sat down,
    arranged the paper over his knees, laid his old ragged grey head back on
    his precious Sunday-go-meetings-and slept.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AcrossTheStraits"></a>Across The Straits</b></h2>
  <p>We crossed Cook&rsquo;s Straits from Wellington in one of those rusty little
    iron tanks that go up and down and across there for twenty or thirty years
    and never get wrecked&mdash;for no other reason, apparently, than that they
    have every possible excuse to go ashore or go down on those stormy coasts.
    The age, construction, or condition of these boats, and the south-easters,
    and the construction of the coastline, are all decidedly in favour of their
    going down; the fares are high and the accommodation is small and dirty.
    It is always the same where there is no competition.</p>
  <p>A year or two ago, when a company was running boats between Australia and
    New Zealand without competition, the steerage fare was three pound direct
    single, and two pound ten shillings between Auckland and Wellington. The
    potatoes were black and green and soggy, the beef like bits scraped off the
    inside of a hide which had lain out for a day or so, the cabbage was cabbage
    leaves, the tea muddy. The whole business took away our appetite regularly
    three times a day, and there wasn&rsquo;t enough to go round, even if it
    had been good&mdash;enough tucker, we mean; there was enough appetite to
    go round three or four times, but it was driven away by disgust until after
    meals. If we had not, under cover of darkness, broached a deck cargo of oranges,
    lemons, and pineapples, and thereby run the risk of being run in on arrival,
    there would have been starvation, disease, and death on that boat before
    the end&mdash;perhaps mutiny.</p>
  <p>You can go across now for one pound, and get something to eat on the road;
    but the travelling public will go on patronizing the latest reducer of fares
    until the poorer company gets starved out and fares go up again&mdash;then
    the travelling public will have to pay three or four times as much as they
    do now, and go hungry on the voyage; all of which ought to go to prove that
    the travelling public is as big a fool as the general public.</p>
  <p>We can&rsquo;t help thinking that the captains and crews of our primitive
    little coastal steamers take the chances so often that they in time get used
    to it, and, being used to it, have no longer any misgivings or anxiety in
    rough weather concerning a watery grave, but feel as perfectly safe as if
    they were in church with their wives or sisters&mdash;only more comfortable&mdash;and
    go on feeling so until the worn-out machinery breaks down and lets the old
    tub run ashore, or knocks a hole in her side, or the side itself rusts through
    at last and lets the water in, or the last straw in the shape of an extra
    ton of brine tumbles on board, and the <i>John Smith (Newcastle)</i>, goes
    down with a swoosh before the cook has time to leave off peeling his potatoes
    and take to prayer.</p>
  <p>These cheerful&mdash;and, maybe, unjust&mdash;reflections are perhaps in
    consequence of our having lost half a sovereign to start with. We arrived
    at the booking-office with two minutes to spare, two sticks of Juno tobacco,
    a spare wooden pipe&mdash;in case we lost the other&mdash;a letter to a friend&rsquo;s
    friend down south, a pound note (Bank of New Zealand), and two half-crowns,
    with which to try our fortunes in the South Island. We also had a few things
    in a portmanteau and two blankets in a three-bushel bag, but they didn&rsquo;t
    amount to much. The clerk put down the ticket with the half-sovereign on
    top of it, and we wrapped the latter in the former and ran for the wharf.
    On the way we snatched the ticket out to see the name of the boat we were
    going by, in order to find it, and it was then, we suppose, that the semi-quid
    got lost.</p>
  <p>Did you ever lose a sovereign or a half-sovereign under similar circumstances?
    You think of it casually and feel for it carelessly at first, to be sure
    that it&rsquo;s there all right; then, after going through your pockets three
    or four times with rapidly growing uneasiness, you lose your head a little
    and dredge for that coin hurriedly and with painful anxiety. Then you force
    yourself to be calm, and proceed to search yourself systematically, in a
    methodical manner. At this stage, if you have time, it&rsquo;s a good plan
    to sit down and think out when and where you last had that half-sovereign,
    and where you have been since, and which way you came from there, and what
    you took out of your pocket, and where, and whether you might have given
    it in mistake for sixpence at that pub where you rushed in to have a beer&mdash;and
    then you calculate the chances against getting it back again. The last of
    these reflections is apt to be painful, and the painfulness is complicated
    and increased when there happen to have been several pubs and a like number
    of hurried farewell beers in the recent past.</p>
  <p>And for months after that you cannot get rid of the idea that that half-sov.
    might be about your clothes somewhere. It haunts you. You turn your pockets
    out, and feel the lining of your coat and vest inch by inch, and examine
    your letter papers&mdash;everything you happen to have had in your pocket
    that day&mdash;over and over again, and by and by you peer in envelopes and
    unfold papers that you didn&rsquo;t have in your pocket at all, but might
    have had. And when the novelty of the first search has worn off, and the
    fit takes you, you make another search. Even after many months have passed
    away, some day&mdash;or night&mdash;when you are hard up for tobacco and
    a drink, you suddenly think of that late lamented half-sov., and are moved
    by adverse circumstances to look through your old clothes in a sort of forlorn
    hope, or to give good luck a sort of chance to surprise you&mdash;the only
    chance that you can give it.</p>
  <p>By the way, seven-and-six of that half-quid should have gone to the landlord
    of the hotel where we stayed last, and somehow, in spite of this enlightened
    age, the loss of it seemed a judgment; and seeing that the boat was old and
    primitive, and there was every sign of a three days&rsquo; sou&rsquo;-easter,
    we sincerely hoped that judgment was complete&mdash;that supreme wrath had
    been appeased by the fine of ten bob without adding any Jonah business to
    it.</p>
  <p>This reminds us that we once found a lost half-sovereign in the bowl of
    a spare pipe six months after it was lost. We wish it had stayed there and
    turned up to-night. But, although when you are in great danger&mdash;say,
    adrift in an open boat&mdash;tales of providential escapes and rescues may
    interest and comfort you, you can&rsquo;t get any comfort out of anecdotes
    concerning the turning up of lost quids when you have just lost one yourself.
    All you want is to find it.</p>
  <p>It bothers you even not to be able to account for a bob. You always like
    to know that you have had something for your money, if only a long beer.
    You would sooner know that you fooled your money away on a spree, and made
    yourself sick than lost it out of an extra hole in your pocket, and kept
    well.</p>
  <p>We left Wellington with a feeling of pained regret, a fellow-wanderer by
    our side telling us how he had once lost &ldquo;fi-pun-note&rdquo;&mdash;and
    about two-thirds of the city unemployed on the wharf looking for that half-sovereign.
    Well, we hope that some poor devil found it; although, to tell the truth,
    we would then have by far preferred to have found it ourselves.</p>
  <p>A sailor said that the <i>Moa</i> was a good sea-boat, and, although she
    was small and old, <i>he</i> was never afraid of her. He&rsquo;d sooner travel
    in her than in some of those big cheap ocean liners with more sand in them
    than iron or steel&mdash;You, know the rest. Further on, in a conversation
    concerning the age of these coasters, he said that they&rsquo;d last fully
    thirty years if well painted and looked after. He said that this one was
    seldom painted, and never painted properly; and then, seemingly in direct
    contradiction to his previously expressed confidence in the safety and seaworthiness
    of the <i>Moa</i>, he said that he could poke a stick through her anywhere.
    We asked him not to do it.</p>
  <p>It came on to splash, and we went below to reflect, and search once more
    for that half-sovereign. The cabin was small and close, and dimly lighted,
    and evil smelling, and shaped like the butt end of a coffin. It might not
    have smelt so bad if we hadn&rsquo;t lost that half-sovereign. There was
    a party of those gipsy-like Assyrians&mdash;two families apparently&mdash;the
    women and children lying very sick about the lower bunks; and a big, good-humoured-looking
    young Maori propped between the end of the table and the wall, playing a
    concertina. The sick people were too sick, and the concertina seemed too
    much in sympathy with them, and the lost half-quid haunted us more than ever
    down there; so we started to climb out.</p>
  <p>The first thing that struck us was the jagged top edge of that iron hood-like
    arrangement over the gangway. The top half only of the scuttle was open.
    There was nothing to be seen except a fog of spray and a Newfoundland dog
    sea-sick under the lee of something. The next thing that struck us was a
    tub of salt water, which came like a cannon ball and broke against the hood
    affair, and spattered on deck like a crockery shop. We climbed down again
    backwards, and sat on the floor with emphasis, in consequence of stepping
    down a last step that wasn&rsquo;t there, and cracked the back of our heads
    against the edge of the table. The Maori helped us up, and we had a drink
    with him at the expense of one of the half-casers mentioned in the beginning
    of this sketch. Then the Maori shouted, then we, then the Maori again, then
    we again; and then we thought, &ldquo;Dash it, what&rsquo;s a half-sovereign?
    We&rsquo;ll fall on our feet all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went up Queen Charlotte&rsquo;s Sound, a long crooked arm of the sea
    between big, rugged, black-looking hills. There was a sort of lighthouse
    down near the entrance, and they said an old Maori woman kept it. There were
    some whitish things on the sides of the hills, which we at first took for
    cattle, and then for goats. They were sheep. Someone said that that country
    was only fit to carry sheep. It must have been bad, then, judging from some
    of the country in Australia which is only fit to carry sheep. Country that
    wouldn&rsquo;t carry goats would carry sheep, we think. Sheep are about the
    hardiest animals on the face of this planet&mdash;barring crocodiles.</p>
  <p>You may rip a sheep open whilst watching for the boss&rsquo;s boots or yarning
    to a pen-mate, and then when you have stuffed the works back into the animal,
    and put a stitch in the slit, and poked it somewhere with a tar-stick (it
    doesn&rsquo;t matter much where) the jumbuck will be all right and just as
    lively as ever, and turn up next shearing without the ghost of a scratch
    on its skin.</p>
  <p>We reached Picton, a small collection of twinkling lights in a dark pocket,
    apparently at the top of a sound. We climbed up on to the wharf, got through
    between two railway trucks, and asked a policeman where we were, and where
    the telegraph office was. There were several pretty girls in the office,
    laughing and chyacking the counter clerks, which jarred upon the feelings
    of this poor orphan wanderer in strange lands. We gloomily took a telegram
    form, and wired to a friend in North Island, using the following words: &ldquo;Wire
    quid; stumped.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then we crossed the street to a pub and asked for a roof and they told us
    to go up to No. 8. We went up, struck a match, lit the candle, put our bag
    in a corner, cleared the looking-glass off the toilet table, got some paper
    and a pencil out of our portmanteau, and sat down and wrote this sketch.</p>
  <p>The candle is going out.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SomeDay"></a>&ldquo;Some Day&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>The two travellers had yarned late in their camp, and the moon was getting
    low down through the mulga. Mitchell&rsquo;s mate had just finished a rather
    racy yarn, but it seemed to fall flat on Mitchell&mdash;he was in a sentimental
    mood. He smoked a while, and thought, and then said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! there was one little girl that I was properly struck on. She
    came to our place on a visit to my sister. I think she was the best little
    girl that ever lived, and about the prettiest. She was just eighteen, and
    didn&rsquo;t come up to my shoulder; the biggest blue eyes you ever saw,
    and she had hair that reached down to her knees, and so thick you couldn&rsquo;t
    span it with your two hands&mdash;brown and glossy&mdash;and her skin with
    like lilies and roses. Of course, I never thought she&rsquo;d look at a rough,
    ugly, ignorant brute like me, and I used to keep out of her way and act a
    little stiff towards her; I didn&rsquo;t want the others to think I was gone
    on her, because I knew they&rsquo;d laugh at me, and maybe she&rsquo;d laugh
    at me more than all. She would come and talk to me, and sit near me at table;
    but I thought that that was on account of her good nature, and she pitied
    me because I was such a rough, awkward chap. I was gone on that girl, and
    no joking; and I felt quite proud to think she was a countrywoman of mine.
    But I wouldn&rsquo;t let her know that, for I felt sure she&rsquo;d only
    laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things went on till I got the offer of two or three years&rsquo; work
    on a station up near the border, and I had to go, for I was hard up; besides,
    I wanted to get away. Stopping round where she was only made me miserable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The night I left they were all down at the station to see me off&mdash;including
    the girl I was gone on. When the train was ready to start she was standing
    away by herself on the dark end of the platform, and my sister kept nudging
    me and winking, and fooling about, but I didn&rsquo;t know what she was driving
    at. At last she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go and speak to her, you noodle; go and say good-bye to Edie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I went up to where she was, and, when the others turned their
    backs&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, good-bye, Miss Brown,&rsquo; I said, holding out my
    hand; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;ll ever see you again, for Lord
    knows when I&rsquo;ll be back. Thank you for coming to see me off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just then she turned her face to the light, and I saw she was crying.
    She was trembling all over. Suddenly she said, &lsquo;Jack! Jack!&rsquo; just
    like that, and held up her arms like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell was speaking in a tone of voice that didn&rsquo;t belong to him,
    and his mate looked up. Mitchell&rsquo;s face was solemn, and his eyes were
    fixed on the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you gave her a good hug then, and a kiss?&rdquo; asked
    the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose so,&rdquo; snapped Mitchell. &ldquo;There is some
    things a man doesn&rsquo;t want to joke about.... Well, I think we&rsquo;ll
    shove on one of the billies, and have a drink of tea before we turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, as they drank their
    tea, &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll go back and marry her some day?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some day! That&rsquo;s it; it looks like it, doesn&rsquo;t it? We
    all say, &lsquo;Some day.&rsquo; I used to say it ten years ago, and look
    at me now. I&rsquo;ve been knocking round for five years, and the last two
    years constant on the track, and no show of getting off it unless I go for
    good, and what have I got for it? I look like going home and getting married,
    without a penny in my pocket or a rag to my back scarcely, and no show of
    getting them. I swore I&rsquo;d never go back home without a cheque, and,
    what&rsquo;s more, I never will; but the cheque days are past. Look at that
    boot! If we were down among the settled districts we&rsquo;d be called tramps
    and beggars; and what&rsquo;s the difference? I&rsquo;ve been a fool, I know,
    but I&rsquo;ve paid for it; and now there&rsquo;s nothing for it but to tramp,
    tramp, tramp for your tucker, and keep tramping till you get old and careless
    and dirty, and older, and more careless and dirtier, and you get used to
    the dust and sand, and heat, and flies, and mosquitoes, just as a bullock
    does, and lose ambition and hope, and get contented with this animal life,
    like a dog, and till your swag seems part of yourself, and you&rsquo;d be
    lost and uneasy and light-shouldered without it, and you don&rsquo;t care
    a damn if you&rsquo;ll ever get work again, or live like a Christian; and
    you go on like this till the spirit of a bullock takes the place of the heart
    of a man. Who cares? If we hadn&rsquo;t found the track yesterday we might
    have lain and rotted in that lignum, and no one been any the wiser&mdash;or
    sorrier&mdash;who knows? Somebody might have found us in the end, but it
    mightn&rsquo;t have been worth his while to go out of his way and report
    us. Damn the world, say I!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He smoked for a while in savage silence; then he knocked the ashes out of
    his pipe, felt for his tobacco with a sigh, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I am a bit out of sorts to-night. I&rsquo;ve been thinking....
    I think we&rsquo;d best turn in, old man; we&rsquo;ve got a long, dry stretch
    before us to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They rolled out their swags on the sand, lay down, and wrapped themselves
    in their blankets. Mitchell covered his face with a piece of calico, because
    the moonlight and wind kept him awake.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BrummyUsen"></a>&ldquo;Brummy Usen&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>We caught up with an old swagman crossing the plain, and tramped along with
    him till we came to good shade to have a smoke in. We had got yarning about
    men getting lost in the bush or going away and being reported dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old &lsquo;whaler&rsquo;, as he dropped his
    swag in the shade, sat down on it, and felt for his smoking tackle, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    scarcely an old bushman alive&mdash;or dead, for the matter of that&mdash;who
    hasn&rsquo;t been dead a few times in his life&mdash;or reported dead, which
    amounts to the same thing for a while. In my time there was as many live
    men in the bush who was supposed to be dead as there was dead men who was
    supposed to be alive&mdash;though it&rsquo;s the other way about now&mdash;what
    with so many jackaroos tramping about out back and getting lost in the dry
    country that they don&rsquo;t know anything about, and dying within a few
    yards of water sometimes. But even now, whenever I hear that an old bush
    mate of mine is dead, I don&rsquo;t fret about it or put a black band round
    my hat, because I know he&rsquo;ll be pretty sure to turn up sometimes, pretty
    bad with the booze, and want to borrow half a crown.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been dead a few times myself, and found out afterwards
    that my friends was so sorry about it, and that I was such a good sort of
    a chap after all, when I was dead that&mdash;that I was sorry I didn&rsquo;t
    stop dead. You see, I was one of them chaps that&rsquo;s better treated by
    their friends and better thought of when&mdash;when they&rsquo;re dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! Never mind.... Talking of killing bushmen before their
    time reminds me of some cases I knew. They mostly happened among the western
    spurs of the ranges. There was a bullock-driver named Billy Nowlett. He had
    a small selection, where he kept his family, and used to carry from the railway
    terminus to the stations up-country. One time he went up with a load and
    was not heard of for such a long time that his missus got mighty uneasy;
    and then she got a letter from a publican up Coonamble way to say that Billy
    was dead. Someone wrote, for the widow, to ask about the wagon and the bullocks,
    but the shanty-keeper wrote that Billy had drunk them before he died, and
    that he&rsquo;d also to say that he&rsquo;d drunk the money he got for the
    carrying; and the publican enclosed a five-pound note for the widow&mdash;which
    was considered very kind of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the widow struggled along and managed without her husband just
    the same as she had always struggled along and managed with him&mdash;a little
    better, perhaps. An old digger used to drop in of evenings and sit by the
    widow&rsquo;s fire, and yarn, and sympathize, and smoke, and think; and just
    as he began to yarn a lot less, and smoke and think a lot more, Billy Nowlett
    himself turned up with a load of rations for a sheep station. He&rsquo;d
    been down by the other road, and the letter he&rsquo;d wrote to his missus
    had gone astray. Billy wasn&rsquo;t surprised to hear that he was dead&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    been killed before&mdash;but he was surprised about the five quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, it must have been another bullock-driver that died. There
    was an old shanty-keeper up Coonamble way, so Billy said, that used to always
    mistake him for another bullocky and mistake the other bullocky for him&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t
    tell the one from the other no way&mdash;and he used to have bills against
    Billy that the other bullock-driver&rsquo;d run up, and bills against the
    other that Billy&rsquo;d run up, and generally got things mixed up in various
    ways, till Billy wished that one of &rsquo;em was dead. And the funniest
    part of the business was that Billy wasn&rsquo;t no more like the other man
    than chalk is like cheese. You&rsquo;ll often drop across some colour-blind
    old codger that can&rsquo;t tell the difference between two people that ain&rsquo;t
    got a bit of likeness between &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there was young Joe Swallow. He was found dead under a burned-down
    tree in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gully&mdash;&lsquo;dead past all recognition,&rsquo; they
    said&mdash;and he was buried there, and by and by his ghost began to haunt
    the gully: at least, all the schoolkids seen it, and there was scarcely a
    grown-up person who didn&rsquo;t know another person who&rsquo;d seen the
    ghost&mdash;and the other person was always a sober chap that wouldn&rsquo;t
    bother about telling a lie. But just as the ghost was beginning to settle
    down to work in the gully, Joe himself turned up, and then the folks began
    to reckon that it was another man was killed there, and that the ghost belonged
    to the other man; and some of them began to recollect that they&rsquo;d thought
    all along that the ghost wasn&rsquo;t Joe&rsquo;s ghost&mdash;even when they
    thought that it was really Joe that was killed there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then, again, there was the case of Brummy Usen&mdash;Hughison I think
    they spelled it&mdash;the bushranger; he was shot by old Mr S&mdash;, of
    E&mdash;, while trying to stick the old gentleman up. There&rsquo;s something
    about it in a book called &lsquo;Robbery Under Arms&rsquo;, though the names
    is all altered&mdash;and some other time I&rsquo;ll tell you all about the
    digging of the body up for the inquest and burying it again. This Brummy
    used to work for a publican in a sawmill that the publican had; and this
    publican and his daughter identified the body by a woman holding up a branch
    tattooed on the right arm. I&rsquo;ll tell you all about that another time.
    This girl remembered how she used to watch this tattooed woman going up and
    down on Brummy&rsquo;s arm when he was working in the saw-pit&mdash;going
    up and down and up and down, like this, while Brummy was working his end
    of the saw. So the bushranger was inquested and justifiable-homicided as
    Brummy Usen, and buried again in his dust and blood stains and monkey-jacket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All the same it wasn&rsquo;t him; for the real Brummy turned up later
    on; but he couldn&rsquo;t make the people believe he wasn&rsquo;t dead. They
    was mostly English country people from Kent and Yorkshire and those places;
    and the most self-opinionated and obstinate people that ever lived when they
    got a thing into their heads; and they got it into their heads that Brummy
    Usen was shot while trying to bail up old Mr S&mdash; and was dead and buried.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But the wife of the publican that had the saw-pit knew him; he went
    to her, and she recognized him at once; she&rsquo;d got it into her head
    from the first that it wasn&rsquo;t Brummy that was shot, and she stuck to
    it&mdash;she was just as self-opinionated as the neighbours, and many a barney
    she had with them about it. She would argue about it till the day she died,
    and then she said with her dying breath: &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Brummy Usen.&rsquo; No
    more it was&mdash;he was a different kind of man; he hadn&rsquo;t spunk enough
    to be a bushranger, and it was a better man that was buried for him; it was
    a different kind of woman, holding up a different kind of branch, that was
    tattooed on Brummy&rsquo;s arm. But, you see, Brummy&rsquo;d always kept
    himself pretty much to himself, and no one knew him very well; and, besides,
    most of them were pretty drunk at the inquest&mdash;except the girl, and
    she was too scared to know what she was saying&mdash;they had to be so because
    the corpse was in such a bad state.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Brummy hung around for a time, and tried to prove that he wasn&rsquo;t
    an impostor, but no one wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. He wanted to get some
    wages that was owing to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He tried the police, but they were just as obstinate as the rest;
    and, beside, they had their dignity to hold up. &lsquo;If I ain&rsquo;t Brummy,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d
    say,  &lsquo;who are I?&rsquo; But they answered that he knew best. So he
    did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last he said that it didn&rsquo;t matter much, any road; and so
    he went away&mdash;Lord knows where&mdash;to begin life again, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The traveller smoked awhile reflectively; then he quietly rolled up his
    right sleeve and scratched his arm.</p>
  <p>And on that arm we saw the tattooed figure of a woman, holding up a branch.</p>
  <p>We tramped on by his side again towards the station&mdash;thinking very
    hard and not feeling very comfortable.</p>
  <p>He must have been an awful old liar, now we come to think of it</p>

  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDroversWife"></a>The Drover&rsquo;s Wife</b></h2>
  <p>The two-roomed house is built of round timber, slabs, and stringy-bark,
    and floored with split slabs. A big bark kitchen standing at one end is larger
    than the house itself, veranda included.</p>
  <p>Bush all round&mdash;bush with no horizon, for the country is flat. No ranges
    in the distance. The bush consists of stunted, rotten native apple-trees.
    No undergrowth. Nothing to relieve the eye save the darker green of a few
    she-oaks which are sighing above the narrow, almost waterless creek. Nineteen
    miles to the nearest sign of civilization&mdash;a shanty on the main road.</p>
  <p>The drover, an ex-squatter, is away with sheep. His wife and children are
    left here alone.</p>
  <p>Four ragged, dried-up-looking children are playing about the house. Suddenly
    one of them yells: &ldquo;Snake! Mother, here&rsquo;s a snake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The gaunt, sun-browned bushwoman dashes from the kitchen, snatches her baby
    from the ground, holds it on her left hip, and reaches for a stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! gone into the wood-heap!&rdquo; yells the eldest boy&mdash;a
    sharp-faced urchin of eleven. &ldquo;Stop there, mother! I&rsquo;ll have
    him. Stand back! I&rsquo;ll have the beggar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tommy, come here, or you&rsquo;ll be bit. Come here at once when
    I tell you, you little wretch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The youngster comes reluctantly, carrying a stick bigger than himself. Then
    he yells, triumphantly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There it goes&mdash;under the house!&rdquo; and darts away with club
    uplifted. At the same time the big, black, yellow-eyed dog-of-all-breeds,
    who has shown the wildest interest in the proceedings, breaks his chain and
    rushes after that snake. He is a moment late, however, and his nose reaches
    the crack in the slabs just as the end of its tail disappears. Almost at
    the same moment the boy&rsquo;s club comes down and skins the aforesaid nose.
    Alligator takes small notice of this, and proceeds to undermine the building;
    but he is subdued after a struggle and chained up. They cannot afford to
    lose him.</p>
  <p>The drover&rsquo;s wife makes the children stand together near the dog-house
    while she watches for the snake. She gets two small dishes of milk and sets
    them down near the wall to tempt it to come out; but an hour goes by and
    it does not show itself.</p>
  <p>It is near sunset, and a thunderstorm is coming. The children must be brought
    inside. She will not take them into the house, for she knows the snake is
    there, and may at any moment come up through a crack in the rough slab floor;
    so she carries several armfuls of firewood into the kitchen, and then takes
    the children there. The kitchen has no floor&mdash;or, rather, an earthen
    one&mdash;called a &ldquo;ground floor&rdquo; in this part of the bush. There
    is a large, roughly-made table in the centre of the place. She brings the
    children in, and makes them get on this table. They are two boys and two
    girls&mdash;mere babies. She gives them some supper, and then, before it
    gets dark, she goes into the house, and snatches up some pillows and bedclothes&mdash;expecting
    to see or lay her hand on the snake any minute. She makes a bed on the kitchen
    table for the children, and sits down beside it to watch all night.</p>
  <p>She has an eye on the corner, and a green sapling club laid in readiness
    on the dresser by her side; also her sewing basket and a copy of the <i>Young
    Ladies&rsquo;  Journal</i>. She has brought the dog into the room.</p>
  <p>Tommy turns in, under protest, but says he&rsquo;ll lie awake all night
    and smash that blinded snake.</p>
  <p>His mother asks him how many times she has told him not to swear.</p>
  <p>He has his club with him under the bedclothes, and Jacky protests:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mummy! Tommy&rsquo;s skinnin&rsquo; me alive wif his club. Make him
    take it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tommy: &ldquo;Shet up, you little&mdash;! D&rsquo;yer want to be bit with
    the snake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jacky shuts up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If yer bit,&rdquo; says Tommy, after a pause, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll
    swell up, an&rsquo; smell, an&rsquo; turn red an&rsquo; green an&rsquo; blue
    all over till yer bust. Won&rsquo;t he, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, don&rsquo;t frighten the child. Go to sleep,&rdquo; she
    says.</p>
  <p>The two younger children go to sleep, and now and then Jacky complains of
    being &ldquo;skeezed.&rdquo; More room is made for him. Presently Tommy says: &ldquo;Mother!
    listen to them (adjective) little &rsquo;possums. I&rsquo;d like to screw
    their blanky necks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Jacky protests drowsily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But they don&rsquo;t hurt us, the little blanks!&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Mother: &ldquo;There, I told you you&rsquo;d teach Jacky to swear.&rdquo; But
    the remark makes her smile. Jacky goes to sleep. Presently Tommy asks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother! Do you think they&rsquo;ll ever extricate the (adjective)
    kangaroo?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lord! How am I to know, child? Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wake me if the snake comes out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Near midnight. The children are all asleep and she sits there still, sewing
    and reading by turns. From time to time she glances round the floor and wall-plate,
    and, whenever she hears a noise, she reaches for the stick. The thunderstorm
    comes on, and the wind, rushing through the cracks in the slab wall, threatens
    to blow out her candle. She places it on a sheltered part of the dresser
    and fixes up a newspaper to protect it. At every flash of lightning, the
    cracks between the slabs gleam like polished silver. The thunder rolls, and
    the rain comes down in torrents.</p>
  <p>Alligator lies at full length on the floor, with his eyes turned towards
    the partition. She knows by this that the snake is there. There are large
    cracks in that wall opening under the floor of the dwelling-house.</p>
  <p>She is not a coward, but recent events have shaken her nerves. A little
    son of her brother-in-law was lately bitten by a snake, and died. Besides,
    she has not heard from her husband for six months, and is anxious about him.</p>
  <p>He was a drover, and started squatting here when they were married. The
    drought of 18&mdash; ruined him. He had to sacrifice the remnant of his flock
    and go droving again. He intends to move his family into the nearest town
    when he comes back, and, in the meantime, his brother, who keeps a shanty
    on the main road, comes over about once a month with provisions. The wife
    has still a couple of cows, one horse, and a few sheep. The brother-in-law
    kills one of the latter occasionally, gives her what she needs of it, and
    takes the rest in return for other provisions. She is used to being left
    alone. She once lived like this for eighteen months. As a girl she built
    the usual castles in the air; but all her girlish hopes and aspirations have
    long been dead. She finds all the excitement and recreation she needs in
    the <i>Young Ladies&rsquo; Journal</i>, and Heaven help her! takes a pleasure
    in the fashion-plates.</p>
  <p>Her husband is an Australian, and so is she. He is careless, but a good
    enough husband. If he had the means he would take her to the city and keep
    her there like a princess. They are used to being apart, or at least she
    is. &ldquo;No use fretting,&rdquo; she says. He may forget sometimes that
    he is married; but if he has a good cheque when he comes back he will give
    most of it to her. When he had money he took her to the city several times&mdash;hired
    a railway sleeping compartment, and put up at the best hotels. He also bought
    her a buggy, but they had to sacrifice that along with the rest.</p>
  <p>The last two children were born in the bush&mdash;one while her husband
    was bringing a drunken doctor, by force, to attend to her. She was alone
    on this occasion, and very weak. She had been ill with a fever. She prayed
    to God to send her assistance. God sent Black Mary&mdash;the &ldquo;whitest&rdquo; gin
    in all the land. Or, at least, God sent King Jimmy first, and he sent Black
    Mary. He put his black face round the door post, took in the situation at
    a glance, and said cheerfully: &ldquo;All right, missus&mdash;I bring my
    old woman, she down alonga creek.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the children died while she was here alone. She rode nineteen miles
    for assistance, carrying the dead child.</p>
  <p>It must be near one or two o&rsquo;clock. The fire is burning low. Alligator
    lies with his head resting on his paws, and watches the wall. He is not a
    very beautiful dog, and the light shows numerous old wounds where the hair
    will not grow. He is afraid of nothing on the face of the earth or under
    it. He will tackle a bullock as readily as he will tackle a flea. He hates
    all other dogs&mdash;except kangaroo-dogs&mdash;and has a marked dislike
    to friends or relations of the family. They seldom call, however. He sometimes
    makes friends with strangers. He hates snakes and has killed many, but he
    will be bitten some day and die; most snake-dogs end that way.</p>
  <p>Now and then the bushwoman lays down her work and watches, and listens,
    and thinks. She thinks of things in her own life, for there is little else
    to think about.</p>
  <p>The rain will make the grass grow, and this reminds her how she fought a
    bush-fire once while her husband was away. The grass was long, and very dry,
    and the fire threatened to burn her out. She put on an old pair of her husband&rsquo;s
    trousers and beat out the flames with a green bough, till great drops of
    sooty perspiration stood out on her forehead and ran in streaks down her
    blackened arms. The sight of his mother in trousers greatly amused Tommy,
    who worked like a little hero by her side, but the terrified baby howled
    lustily for his &ldquo;mummy.&rdquo; The fire would have mastered her but
    for four excited bushmen who arrived in the nick of time. It was a mixed-up
    affair all round; when she went to take up the baby he screamed and struggled
    convulsively, thinking it was a &ldquo;blackman;&rdquo; and Alligator, trusting
    more to the child&rsquo;s sense than his own instinct, charged furiously,
    and (being old and slightly deaf) did not in his excitement at first recognize
    his mistress&rsquo;s voice, but continued to hang on to the moleskins until
    choked off by Tommy with a saddle-strap. The dog&rsquo;s sorrow for his blunder,
    and his anxiety to let it be known that it was all a mistake, was as evident
    as his ragged tail and a twelve-inch grin could make it. It was a glorious
    time for the boys; a day to look back to, and talk about, and laugh over
    for many years.</p>
  <p>She thinks how she fought a flood during her husband&rsquo;s absence. She
    stood for hours in the drenching downpour, and dug an overflow gutter to
    save the dam across the creek. But she could not save it. There are things
    that a bushwoman can not do. Next morning the dam was broken, and her heart
    was nearly broken too, for she thought how her husband would feel when he
    came home and saw the result of years of labour swept away. She cried then.</p>
  <p>She also fought the pleuro-pneumonia&mdash;dosed and bled the few remaining
    cattle, and wept again when her two best cows died.</p>
  <p>Again, she fought a mad bullock that besieged the house for a day. She made
    bullets and fired at him through cracks in the slabs with an old shot-gun.
    He was dead in the morning. She skinned him and got seventeen-and-sixpence
    for the hide.</p>
  <p>She also fights the crows and eagles that have designs on her chickens.
    Her plan of campaign is very original. The children cry &ldquo;Crows, mother!&rdquo; and
    she rushes out and aims a broomstick at the birds as though it were a gun,
    and says  &ldquo;Bung!&rdquo; The crows leave in a hurry; they are cunning,
    but a woman&rsquo;s cunning is greater.</p>
  <p>Occasionally a bushman in the horrors, or a villainous-looking sundowner,
    comes and nearly scares the life out of her. She generally tells the suspicious-looking
    stranger that her husband and two sons are at work below the dam, or over
    at the yard, for he always cunningly inquires for the boss.</p>
  <p>Only last week a gallows-faced swagman&mdash;having satisfied himself that
    there were no men on the place&mdash;threw his swag down on the veranda,
    and demanded tucker. She gave him something to eat; then he expressed his
    intention of staying for the night. It was sundown then. She got a batten
    from the sofa, loosened the dog, and confronted the stranger, holding the
    batten in one hand and the dog&rsquo;s collar with the other. &ldquo;Now
    you go!&rdquo; she said. He looked at her and at the dog, said &ldquo;All
    right, mum,&rdquo; in a cringing tone, and left. She was a determined-looking
    woman, and Alligator&rsquo;s yellow eyes glared unpleasantly&mdash;besides,
    the dog&rsquo;s chawing-up apparatus greatly resembled that of the reptile
    he was named after.</p>
  <p>She has few pleasures to think of as she sits here alone by the fire, on
    guard against a snake. All days are much the same to her; but on Sunday afternoon
    she dresses herself, tidies the children, smartens up baby, and goes for
    a lonely walk along the bush-track, pushing an old perambulator in front
    of her. She does this every Sunday. She takes as much care to make herself
    and the children look smart as she would if she were going to do the block
    in the city. There is nothing to see, however, and not a soul to meet. You
    might walk for twenty miles along this track without being able to fix a
    point in your mind, unless you are a bushman. This is because of the everlasting,
    maddening sameness of the stunted trees&mdash;that monotony which makes a
    man long to break away and travel as far as trains can go, and sail as far
    as ship can sail&mdash;and farther.</p>
  <p>But this bushwoman is used to the loneliness of it. As a girl-wife she hated
    it, but now she would feel strange away from it.</p>
  <p>She is glad when her husband returns, but she does not gush or make a fuss
    about it. She gets him something good to eat, and tidies up the children.</p>
  <p>She seems contented with her lot. She loves her children, but has no time
    to show it. She seems harsh to them. Her surroundings are not favourable
    to the development of the &ldquo;womanly&rdquo; or sentimental side of nature.</p>
  <p>It must be near morning now; but the clock is in the dwellinghouse. Her
    candle is nearly done; she forgot that she was out of candles. Some more
    wood must be got to keep the fire up, and so she shuts the dog inside and
    hurries round to the woodheap. The rain has cleared off. She seizes a stick,
    pulls it out, and&mdash;crash! the whole pile collapses.</p>
  <p>Yesterday she bargained with a stray blackfellow to bring her some wood,
    and while he was at work she went in search of a missing cow. She was absent
    an hour or so, and the native black made good use of his time. On her return
    she was so astonished to see a good heap of wood by the chimney, that she
    gave him an extra fig of tobacco, and praised him for not being lazy. He
    thanked her, and left with head erect and chest well out. He was the last
    of his tribe and a King; but he had built that wood-heap hollow.</p>
  <p>She is hurt now, and tears spring to her eyes as she sits down again by
    the table. She takes up a handkerchief to wipe the tears away, but pokes
    her eyes with her bare fingers instead. The handkerchief is full of holes,
    and she finds that she has put her thumb through one, and her forefinger
    through another.</p>
  <p>This makes her laugh, to the surprise of the dog. She has a keen, very keen,
    sense of the ridiculous; and some time or other she will amuse bushmen with
    the story.</p>
  <p>She had been amused before like that. One day she sat down &ldquo;to have
    a good cry,&rdquo; as she said&mdash;and the old cat rubbed against her dress
    and &ldquo;cried too.&rdquo;  Then she had to laugh.</p>
  <p>It must be near daylight now. The room is very close and hot because of
    the fire. Alligator still watches the wall from time to time. Suddenly he
    becomes greatly interested; he draws himself a few inches nearer the partition,
    and a thrill runs through his body. The hair on the back of his neck begins
    to bristle, and the battle-light is in his yellow eyes. She knows what this
    means, and lays her hand on the stick. The lower end of one of the partition
    slabs has a large crack on both sides. An evil pair of small, bright bead-like
    eyes glisten at one of these holes. The snake&mdash;a black one&mdash;comes
    slowly out, about a foot, and moves its head up and down. The dog lies still,
    and the woman sits as one fascinated. The snake comes out a foot farther.
    She lifts her stick, and the reptile, as though suddenly aware of danger,
    sticks his head in through the crack on the other side of the slab, and hurries
    to get his tail round after him. Alligator springs, and his jaws come together
    with a snap. He misses, for his nose is large, and the snake&rsquo;s body
    close down in the angle formed by the slabs and the floor. He snaps again
    as the tail comes round. He has the snake now, and tugs it out eighteen inches.
    Thud, thud comes the woman&rsquo;s club on the ground. Alligator pulls again.
    Thud, thud. Alligator gives another pull and he has the snake out&mdash;a
    black brute, five feet long. The head rises to dart about, but the dog has
    the enemy close to the neck. He is a big, heavy dog, but quick as a terrier.
    He shakes the snake as though he felt the original curse in common with mankind.
    The eldest boy wakes up, seizes his stick, and tries to get out of bed, but
    his mother forces him back with a grip of iron. Thud, thud&mdash;the snake&rsquo;s
    back is broken in several places. Thud, thud&mdash;its head is crushed, and
    Alligator&rsquo;s nose skinned again.</p>
  <p>She lifts the mangled reptile on the point of her stick, carries it to the
    fire, and throws it in; then piles on the wood and watches the snake burn.
    The boy and dog watch too. She lays her hand on the dog&rsquo;s head, and
    all the fierce, angry light dies out of his yellow eyes. The younger children
    are quieted, and presently go to sleep. The dirty-legged boy stands for a
    moment in his shirt, watching the fire. Presently he looks up at her, sees
    the tears in her eyes, and, throwing his arms round her neck exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, I won&rsquo;t never go drovin&rsquo;; blarst me if I do!&rdquo; And
    she hugs him to her worn-out breast and kisses him; and they sit thus together
    while the sickly daylight breaks over the bush.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SteelmansPupil"></a>Steelman&rsquo;s Pupil</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman was a hard case, but some said that Smith was harder. Steelman
    was big and good-looking, and good-natured in his way; he was a spieler,
    pure and simple, but did things in humorous style. Smith was small and weedy,
    of the sneak variety; he had a whining tone and a cringing manner. He seemed
    to be always so afraid you were going to hit him that he would make you want
    to hit him on that account alone.</p>
  <p>Steelman &ldquo;had&rdquo; you in a fashion that would make your friends
    laugh. Smith would &ldquo;have&rdquo; you in a way which made you feel mad
    at the bare recollection of having been taken in by so contemptible a little
    sneak.</p>
  <p>They battled round together in the North Island of Maoriland for a couple
    of years.</p>
  <p>One day Steelman said to Smith:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Smithy, you don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re born yet. I&rsquo;m
    going to take you in hand and teach you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And he did. If Smith wouldn&rsquo;t do as Steelman told him, or wasn&rsquo;t
    successful in cadging, or mugged any game they had in hand, Steelman would
    threaten to stoush him; and, if the warning proved ineffectual after the
    second or third time, he would stoush him.</p>
  <p>One day, on the track, they came to a place where an old Scottish couple
    kept a general store and shanty. They camped alongside the road, and Smith
    was just starting up to the house to beg supplies when Steelman cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here!&mdash;hold on. Now where do you think you&rsquo;re going to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m going to try and chew the old party&rsquo;s lug, of
    course. We&rsquo;ll be out of tucker in a couple of days,&rdquo; said Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman sat down on a stump in a hopeless, discouraged sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use,&rdquo; he said, regarding Smith with mingled reproach
    and disgust.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use. I might as well give it best. I can
    see that it&rsquo;s only waste of time trying to learn you anything. Will
    I ever be able to knock some gumption into your thick skull? After all the
    time and trouble and pains I&rsquo;ve took with your education, you hain&rsquo;t
    got any more sense than to go and mug a business like that! When will you
    learn sense? Hey? After all, I&mdash;Smith, you&rsquo;re a born mug!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He always called Smith a &ldquo;mug&rdquo; when he was particularly wild
    at him, for it hurt Smith more than anything else. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s only
    two classes in the world, spielers and mugs&mdash;and you&rsquo;re a mug,
    Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I done, anyway?&rdquo; asked Smith helplessly. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman wearily rested his brow on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do, Smith,&rdquo; he said listlessly; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    say another word, old man; it&rsquo;ll only make my head worse; don&rsquo;t
    talk. You might, at the very least, have a little consideration for my feelings&mdash;even
    if you haven&rsquo;t for your own interests.&rdquo;  He paused and regarded
    Smith sadly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll give you another show. I&rsquo;ll stage
    the business for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made Smith doff his coat and get into his worst pair of trousers&mdash;and
    they were bad enough; they were hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo; beyond the
    extreme limit of bush decency. He made Smith put on a rag of a felt hat and
    a pair of &ldquo;&rsquo;lastic-sides&rdquo;  which had fallen off a tramp
    and lain baking and rotting by turns on a rubbish heap; they had to be tied
    on Smith with bits of rag and string. He drew dark shadows round Smith&rsquo;s
    eyes, and burning spots on his cheek-bones with some greasepaints he used
    when they travelled as &ldquo;The Great Steelman and Smith Combination Star
    Dramatic Co.&rdquo;  He damped Smith&rsquo;s hair to make it dark and lank,
    and his face more corpse-like by comparison&mdash;in short, he made him up
    to look like a man who had long passed the very last stage of consumption,
    and had been artificially kept alive in the interests of science.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re ready,&rdquo; said Steelman to Smith. &ldquo;You
    left your whare the day before yesterday and started to walk to the hospital
    at Palmerston. An old mate picked you up dying on the road, brought you round,
    and carried you on his back most of the way here. You firmly believe that
    Providence had something to do with the sending of that old mate along at
    that time and place above all others. Your mate also was hard up; he was
    going to a job&mdash;the first show for work he&rsquo;d had in nine months&mdash;but
    he gave it up to see you through; he&rsquo;d give up his life rather than
    desert a mate in trouble. You only want a couple of shillings or a bit of
    tucker to help you on to Palmerston. You know you&rsquo;ve got to die, and
    you only want to live long enough to get word to your poor old mother, and
    die on a bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Remember, they&rsquo;re Scotch up at that house. You understand the
    Scotch barrack pretty well by now&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t it ain&rsquo;t
    my fault. You were born in Aberdeen, but came out too young to remember much
    about the town. Your father&rsquo;s dead. You ran away to sea and came out
    in the <i>Bobbie Burns</i> to Sydney. Your poor old mother&rsquo;s in Aberdeen
    now&mdash;Bruce or Wallace Wynd will do. Your mother might be dead now&mdash;poor
    old soul!&mdash;any way, you&rsquo;ll never see her again. You wish you&rsquo;d
    never run away from home. You wish you&rsquo;d been a better son to your
    poor old mother; you wish you&rsquo;d written to her and answered her last
    letter. You only want to live long enough to write home and ask for forgiveness
    and a blessing before you die. If you had a drop of spirits of some sort
    to brace you up you might get along the road better. (Put this delicately.)
    Get the whine out of your voice and breathe with a wheeze&mdash;like this;
    get up the nearest approach to a deathrattle that you can. Move as if you
    were badly hurt in your wind&mdash;like this. (If you don&rsquo;t do it better&rsquo;n
    that, I&rsquo;ll stoush you.) Make your face a bit longer and keep your lips
    dry&mdash;don&rsquo;t lick them, you damned fool!&mdash;<i>breathe</i> on
    them; make &rsquo;em dry as chips. That&rsquo;s the only decent pair of breeks
    you&rsquo;ve got, and the only &ldquo;shoon.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re a Presbyterian&mdash;not
    a U.P., the Auld Kirk. Your mate would have come up to the house only&mdash;well,
    you&rsquo;ll have to use the stuffing in your head a bit; you can&rsquo;t
    expect me to do all the brain work. Remember it&rsquo;s consumption you&rsquo;ve
    got&mdash;galloping consumption; you know all the symptoms&mdash;pain on
    top of your right lung, bad cough, and night sweats. Something tells you
    that you won&rsquo;t see the new year&mdash;it&rsquo;s a week off Christmas
    now. And if you come back without anything, I&rsquo;ll blessed soon put you
    out of your misery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith came back with about four pounds of shortbread and as much various
    tucker as they could conveniently carry; a pretty good suit of cast-off tweeds;
    a new pair of &rsquo;lastic-sides from the store stock; two bottles of patent
    medicine and a black bottle half-full of home-made consumption-cure; also
    a letter to a hospital-committee man, and three shillings to help him on
    his way to Palmerston. He also got about half a mile of sympathy, religious
    consolation, and medical advice which he didn&rsquo;t remember.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Now</i>,&rdquo; he said, triumphantly, &ldquo;am I a mug or not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman kindly ignored the question. &ldquo;I <i>did</i> have a better
    opinion of the Scotch,&rdquo; he said, contemptuously.</p>
  <p>Steelman got on at an hotel as billiard-marker and decoy, and in six months
    he managed that pub. Smith, who&rsquo;d been away on his own account, turned
    up in the town one day clean broke, and in a deplorable state. He heard of
    Steelman&rsquo;s luck, and thought he was &ldquo;all right,&rdquo; so went
    to his old friend.</p>
  <p>Cold type&mdash;or any other kind of type&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t do justice
    to Steelman&rsquo;s disgust. To think that this was the reward of all the
    time and trouble he&rsquo;d spent on Smith&rsquo;s education! However, when
    he cooled down, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith, you&rsquo;re a young man yet, and it&rsquo;s never too late
    to mend. There is still time for reformation. I can&rsquo;t help you now;
    it would only demoralize you altogether. To think, after the way I trained
    you, you can&rsquo;t battle round any better&rsquo;n this! I always thought
    you were an irreclaimable mug, but I expected better things of you towards
    the end. I thought I&rsquo;d make <i>something</i> of you. It&rsquo;s enough
    to dishearten any man and disgust him with the world. Why! you ought to be
    a rich man now with the chances and training you had! To think&mdash;but
    I won&rsquo;t talk of that; it has made me ill. I suppose I&rsquo;ll have
    to give you something, if it&rsquo;s only to get rid of the sight of you.
    Here&rsquo;s a quid, and I&rsquo;m a mug for giving it to you. It&rsquo;ll
    do you more harm than good; and it ain&rsquo;t a friendly thing nor the right
    thing for me&mdash;who always had your welfare at heart&mdash;to give it
    to you under the circumstances. Now, get away out of my sight, and don&rsquo;t
    come near me till you&rsquo;ve reformed. If you do, I&rsquo;ll have to stoush
    you out of regard for my own health and feelings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman came down in the world again and picked up Smith on the road,
    and they battled round together for another year or so; and at last they
    were in Wellington&mdash;Steelman &ldquo;flush&rdquo; and stopping at an
    hotel, and Smith stumped, as usual, and staying with a friend. One night
    they were drinking together at the hotel, at the expense of some mugs whom
    Steelman was &ldquo;educating.&rdquo; It was raining hard. When Smith was
    going home, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Steely, old man. Listen to the rain! I&rsquo;ll get wringing
    wet going home. You might as well lend me your overcoat to-night. You won&rsquo;t
    want it, and I won&rsquo;t hurt it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And, Steelman&rsquo;s heart being warmed by his successes, he lent the overcoat.</p>
  <p>Smith went and pawned it, got glorious on the proceeds, and took the pawn-ticket
    to Steelman next day.</p>
  <p>Smith had reformed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnUnfinishedLoveStory"></a>An Unfinished Love Story</b></h2>
  <p>Brook let down the heavy, awkward sliprails, and the gaunt cattle stumbled
    through, with aggravating deliberation, and scattered slowly among the native
    apple-trees along the sidling. First there came an old easygoing red poley
    cow, then a dusty white cow; then two shaggy, half-grown calves&mdash;who
    seemed already to have lost all interest in existence&mdash;and after them
    a couple of &ldquo;babies,&rdquo; sleek, glossy, and cheerful; then three
    more tired-looking cows, with ragged udders and hollow sides; then a lanky
    barren heifer&mdash;red, of course&mdash;with half-blind eyes and one crooked
    horn&mdash;she was noted for her great agility in jumping two-rail fences,
    and she was known to the selector as &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth;&rdquo; and behind
    her came a young cream-coloured milker&mdash;a mighty proud and contented
    young mother&mdash;painfully and patiently dragging her first calf, which
    was hanging obstinately to a teat, with its head beneath her hind legs. Last
    of all there came the inevitable red steer, who scratched the dust and let
    a stupid &ldquo;bwoo-ur-r-rr&rdquo; out of him as he snuffed at the rails.</p>
  <p>Brook had shifted the rails there often before&mdash;fifteen years ago&mdash;perhaps
    the selfsame rails, for stringy-bark lasts long; and the action brought the
    past near to him&mdash;nearer than he wished. He did not like to think of
    that hungry, wretched selection existence; he felt more contempt than pity
    for the old-fashioned, unhappy boy, who used to let down the rails there,
    and drive the cattle through.</p>
  <p>He had spent those fifteen years in cities, and had come here, prompted
    more by curiosity than anything else, to have a quiet holiday. His father
    was dead; his other relations had moved away, leaving a tenant on the old
    selection.</p>
  <p>Brook rested his elbow on the top rail of an adjacent panel and watched
    the cattle pass, and thought until Lizzie&mdash;the tenant&rsquo;s niece&mdash;shoved
    the red steer through and stood gravely regarding him (Brook, and not the
    steer); then he shifted his back to the fence and looked at her. He had not
    much to look at: a short, plain, thin girl of nineteen, with rather vacant
    grey eyes, dark ringlets, and freckles; she had no complexion to speak of;
    she wore an ill-fitting print frock, and a pair of men&rsquo;s &rsquo;lastic-sides
    several sizes too large for her. She was &ldquo;studying for a school-teacher;&rdquo; that
    was the height of the ambition of local youth. Brook was studying her.</p>
  <p>He turned away to put up the rails. The lower rail went into its place all
    right, but the top one had got jammed, and it stuck as though it was spiked.
    He worked the rail up and down and to and fro, took it under his arm and
    tugged it; but he might as well have pulled at one of the posts. Then he
    lifted the loose end as high as he could, and let it fall&mdash;jumping back
    out of the way at the same time; this loosened it, but when he lifted it
    again it slid so easily and far into its socket that the other end came out
    and fell, barking Brook&rsquo;s knee. He swore a little, then tackled the
    rail again; he had the same trouble as before with the other end, but succeeded
    at last. Then he turned away, rubbing his knee.</p>
  <p>Lizzie hadn&rsquo;t smiled, not once; she watched him gravely all the while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hurt your knee?&rdquo; she asked, without emotion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. The rail did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reflected solemnly for a while, and then asked him if it felt sore.</p>
  <p>He replied rather briefly in the negative.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were always nasty, awkward rails to put up,&rdquo; she remarked,
    after some more reflection.</p>
  <p>Brook agreed, and then they turned their faces towards the homestead. Half-way
    down the sidling was a clump of saplings, with a big log lying amongst them.
    Here Brook paused. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll sit down for a while and have a rest,&rdquo; said
    he.  &ldquo;Sit down, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She obeyed with the greatest of gravity. Nothing was said for awhile. She
    sat with her hands folded in her lap, gazing thoughtfully at the ridge, which
    was growing dim. It looked better when it was dim, and so did the rest of
    the scenery. There was no beauty lost when darkness hid the scenery altogether.
    Brook wondered what the girl was thinking about. The silence between them
    did not seem awkward, somehow; but it didn&rsquo;t suit him just then, and
    so presently he broke it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thought awhile, and then she asked him if he was glad to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know. Are you sorry, Lizzie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She thought a good long while, and then she said she was.</p>
  <p>He moved closer to the girl, and suddenly slipped his arm round her waist.
    She did not seem agitated; she still gazed dreamily at the line of ridges,
    but her head inclined slightly towards him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie, did you ever love anyone?&rdquo;&mdash;then anticipating
    the usual reply&mdash;&ldquo;except, of course, your father and mother, and
    all that sort of thing.&rdquo; Then, abruptly:  &ldquo;I mean did you ever
    have a sweetheart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reflected, so as to be sure; then she said she hadn&rsquo;t. Long pause,
    and he, the city man, breathed hard&mdash;not the girl. Suddenly he moved
    nervously, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie&mdash;Lizzie! Do you know what love means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She pondered over this for some minutes, as a result of which she said she
    thought that she did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie! Do you think you can love me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She didn&rsquo;t seem able to find an answer to that. So he caught her to
    him in both arms, and kissed her hard and long on the mouth. She was agitated
    now&mdash;he had some complexion now; she struggled to her feet, trembling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must go now,&rdquo; she said quickly. &ldquo;They will be waiting
    for tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He stood up before her, and held her there by both hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is plenty of time. Lizzie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mis-ter Br-o-o-k-er! Li-i-z-zee-e-e! Come ter yer tea-e-e!&rdquo; yelled
    a boy from the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must really go now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they can wait a minute. Lizzie, don&rsquo;t be frightened&rdquo;&mdash;bending
    his head&mdash;&ldquo;Lizzie, put your arms round my neck and kiss me&mdash;now.
    Do as I tell you, Lizzie&mdash;they cannot see us,&rdquo; and he drew her
    behind a bush. &ldquo;Now, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She obeyed just as a frightened child might.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We must go now,&rdquo; she panted, breathless from such an embrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lizzie, you will come for a walk with me after tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I can&rsquo;t promise. I don&rsquo;t think
    it would be right. Aunt mightn&rsquo;t like me to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind aunt. I&rsquo;ll fix her. We&rsquo;ll go for a walk over
    to the school-teacher&rsquo;s place. It will be bright moonlight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to promise. My father and mother might not&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what are you frightened of? What harm is there in it?&rdquo; Then,
    softly, &ldquo;Promise, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Promise, Lizzie. I&rsquo;m going away to-morrow&mdash;might never
    see you again. You will come, Lizzie? It will be our last talk together.
    Promise, Lizzie.... Oh, then, if you don&rsquo;t like to, I won&rsquo;t press
    you.... Will you come, or no?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One more, and I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was nearly dark.</p>
  <p>Brook was moved to get up early next morning and give the girl a hand with
    the cows. There were two rickety bails in the yard. He had not forgotten
    how to milk, but the occupation gave him no pleasure&mdash;it brought the
    past near again.</p>
  <p>Now and then he would turn his face, rest his head against the side of the
    cow, and watch Lizzie at her work; and each time she would, as though in
    obedience to an influence she could not resist, turn her face to him&mdash;having
    noted the pause in his milking. There was a wonder in her expression&mdash;as
    if something had come into her life which she could not realize&mdash;curiosity
    in his.</p>
  <p>When the spare pail was full, he would follow her with it to the little
    bark dairy; and she held out the cloth which served as a strainer whilst
    he poured the milk in, and, as the last drops went through, their mouths
    would come together.</p>
  <p>He carried the slop-buckets to the pigsty for her, and helped to poddy (hand
    feed) a young calf. He had to grip the calf by the nape of the neck, insert
    a forefinger in its mouth, and force its nose down into an oil-drum full
    of skim milk. The calf sucked, thinking it had a teat; and so it was taught
    to drink. But calves have a habit, born of instinct, of butting the udders
    with their noses, by way of reminding their mothers to let down the milk;
    and so this calf butted at times, splashing sour milk over Brook, and barking
    his wrist against the sharp edge of the drum. Then he would swear a little,
    and Lizzie would smile sadly and gravely.</p>
  <p>Brook did not go away that day, nor the next, but he took the coach on the
    third day thereafter. He and Lizzie found a quiet corner to say good-bye
    in. She showed some emotion for the first time, or, perhaps, the second&mdash;maybe
    the third time&mdash;in that week of her life. They had been out together
    in the moonlight every evening. (Brook had been fifteen years in cities.)
    They had scarcely looked at each other that morning&mdash;and scarcely spoken.</p>
  <p>He looked back as the coach started and saw her sitting inside the big kitchen
    window. She waved her hand&mdash;hopelessly it seemed. She had rolled up
    her sleeve, and to Brook the arm seemed strangely white and fair above the
    line of sunburn round the wrist. He hadn&rsquo;t noticed it before. Her face
    seemed fairer too, but, perhaps, it was only the effect of light and shade
    round that window.</p>
  <p>He looked back again, as the coach turned the corner of the fence, and was
    just in time to see her bury her face in her hands with a passionate gesture
    which did not seem natural to her.</p>
  <p>Brook reached the city next evening, and, &ldquo;after hours,&rdquo; he
    staggered in through a side entrance to the lighted parlour of a private
    bar.</p>
  <p>They say that Lizzie broke her heart that year, but, then, the world does
    not believe in such things nowadays.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BoardAndResidence"></a>Board And Residence</b></h2>
  <p>One o&rsquo;clock on Saturday. The unemployed&rsquo;s one o&rsquo;clock
    on Saturday! Nothing more can be done this week, so you drag yourself wearily
    and despairingly  &ldquo;home,&rdquo; with the cheerful prospect of a penniless
    Saturday afternoon and evening and the long horrible Australian-city Sunday
    to drag through. One of the landlady&rsquo;s clutch&mdash;and she <i>is</i> an
    old hen&mdash;opens the door, exclaims:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Careless!&rdquo; and grins. You wait an anxious minute, to
    postpone the disappointment which you feel by instinct is coming, and then
    ask hopelessly whether there are any letters for you.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing for you, Mr Careless.&rdquo; Then in answer
    to the unspoken question, &ldquo;The postman&rsquo;s been, but there&rsquo;s
    nothing for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You hang up your hat in the stuffy little passage, and start upstairs, when, &ldquo;Oh,
    Mr Careless, mother wants to know if you&rsquo;ve had yer dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You haven&rsquo;t, but you say you have. You are empty enough inside, but
    the emptiness is filled up, as it were, with the wrong sort of hungry vacancy&mdash;gnawing
    anxiety. You haven&rsquo;t any stomach for the warm, tasteless mess which
    has been &ldquo;kep&rsquo;  &rsquo;ot&rdquo; for you in a cold stove. You
    feel just physically tired enough to go to your room, lie down on the bed,
    and snatch twenty minutes&rsquo; rest from that terrible unemployed restlessness
    which, you know, is sure to drag you to your feet to pace the room or tramp
    the pavement even before your bodily weariness has nearly left you. So you
    start up the narrow, stuffy little flight of steps called the &ldquo;stairs.&rdquo; Three
    small doors open from the landing&mdash;a square place of about four feet
    by four. The first door is yours; it is open, and&mdash;</p>
  <p>Decided odour of bedroom dust and fluff, damped and kneaded with cold soap-suds.
    Rear view of a girl covered with a damp, draggled, dirt-coloured skirt, which
    gapes at the waistband from the &ldquo;body,&rdquo; disclosing a good glimpse
    of soiled stays (ribs burst), and yawns behind over a decidedly dirty white
    petticoat, the slit of which last, as she reaches forward and backs out convulsively,
    half opens and then comes together in an unsatisfactory, startling, tantalizing
    way, and allows a hint of a red flannel under-something. The frayed ends
    of the skirt lie across a hopelessly-burst pair of elastic-sides which rest
    on their inner edges&mdash;toes out&mdash;and jerk about in a seemingly undecided
    manner. She is damping and working up the natural layer on the floor with
    a piece of old flannel petticoat dipped occasionally in a bucket which stands
    by her side, containing about a quart of muddy water. She looks round and
    exclaims, &ldquo;Oh, did you want to come in, Mr Careless?&rdquo; Then she
    says she&rsquo;ll be done in a minute; furthermore she remarks that if you
    want to come in you won&rsquo;t be in her road. You don&rsquo;t&mdash;you
    go down to the dining-room&mdash;parlour&mdash;sitting-room&mdash;nursery&mdash;and
    stretch yourself on the sofa in the face of the painfully-evident disapproval
    of the landlady.</p>
  <p>You have been here, say, three months, and are only about two weeks behind.
    The landlady still says, &ldquo;Good morning, Mr Careless,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Good
    evening, Mr Careless,&rdquo; but there is an unpleasant accent on the &ldquo;Mr,&rdquo; and
    a still more unpleasantly pronounced stress on the &ldquo;morning&rdquo; or &ldquo;evening.&rdquo; While
    your money lasted you paid up well and regularly&mdash;sometimes in advance&mdash;and
    dined out most of the time; but that doesn&rsquo;t count now.</p>
  <p>Ten minutes pass, and then the landlady&rsquo;s disapproval becomes manifest
    and aggressive. One of the little girls, a sharp-faced little larrikiness,
    who always wears a furtive grin of cunning&mdash;it seems as though it were
    born with her, and is perhaps more a misfortune than a fault&mdash;comes
    in and says please she wants to tidy up.</p>
  <p>So you get up and take your hat and go out again to look for a place to
    rest in&mdash;to try not to think.</p>
  <p>You <i>wish</i> you could get away up-country. You also wish you were dead.</p>
  <p>The landlady, Mrs Jones, is a widow, or grass-widow, Welsh, of course, and
    clannish; flat face, watery grey eyes, shallow, selfish, ignorant, and a
    hypocrite unconsciously&mdash;by instinct.</p>
  <p>But the worst of it is that Mrs Jones takes advantage of the situation to
    corner you in the passage when you want to get out, or when you come in tired,
    and talk. It amounts to about this: She has been fourteen years in this street,
    taking in boarders; everybody knows her; everybody knows Mrs Jones; her poor
    husband died six years ago (God rest his soul); she finds it hard to get
    a living these times; work, work, morning, noon, and night (talk, talk, talk,
    more likely). &ldquo;Do you know Mr Duff of the Labour Bureau?&rdquo; He
    has known her family for years; a very nice gentleman&mdash;a very nice gentleman
    indeed; he often stops at the gate to have a yarn with her on his way to
    the office (he must be hard up for a yarn). She doesn&rsquo;t know hardly
    nobody in this street; she never gossips; it takes her all her time to get
    a living; she can&rsquo;t be bothered with neighbours; it&rsquo;s always
    best to keep to yourself and keep neighbours at a distance. Would you believe
    it, Mr Careless, she has been two years in this house and hasn&rsquo;t said
    above a dozen words to the woman next door; she&rsquo;d just know her by
    sight if she saw her; as for the other woman she wouldn&rsquo;t know her
    from a crow. Mr Blank and Mrs Blank could tell you the same.... She always
    had gentlemen staying with her; she never had no cause to complain of one
    of them except once; they always treated her fair and honest. Here follows
    story about the exception; he, I gathered, was a journalist, and she could
    never depend on him. He seemed, from her statements, to have been decidedly
    erratic in his movements, mode of life and choice of climes. He evidently
    caused her a great deal of trouble and anxiety, and I felt a kind of sneaking
    sympathy for his memory. One young fellow stayed with her five years; he
    was, etc. She couldn&rsquo;t be hard on any young fellow that gets out of
    work; of course if he can&rsquo;t get it he can&rsquo;t pay; she can&rsquo;t
    get blood out of a stone; she couldn&rsquo;t turn him out in the street. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got sons of my own, Mr Careless, I&rsquo;ve got sons of my own.&rdquo;...
    She is sure she always does her best to make her boarders comfortable, and
    if they want anything they&rsquo;ve only got to ask for it. The kettle is
    always on the stove if you want a cup of tea, and if you come home late at
    night and want a bit of supper you&rsquo;ve only got to go to the safe (which
    of us would dare?). She never locks it, she never did.... And then she begins
    about her wonderful kids, and it goes on hour after hour. Lord! it&rsquo;s
    enough to drive a man mad.</p>
  <p>We were recommended to this place on the day of our arrival by a young dealer
    in the furniture line, whose name was Moses&mdash;and he looked like it,
    but we didn&rsquo;t think of that at the time. He had Mrs Jones&rsquo;s card
    in his window, and he left the shop in charge of his missus and came round
    with us at once. He assured us that we couldn&rsquo;t do better than stay
    with her. He said she was a most respectable lady, and all her boarders were
    decent young fellows&mdash;gentlemen; she kept everything scrupulously clean, and
    kept the best table in town, and she&rsquo;d do for us (washing included)
    for eighteen shillings per week; she generally took the first week in advance.
    We asked him to have a beer&mdash;for the want of somebody else to ask&mdash;and
    after that he said that Mrs Jones was a kind, motherly body, and understood
    young fellows; and that we&rsquo;d be even more comfortable than in our own
    home; that we&rsquo;d be allowed to do as we liked&mdash;she wasn&rsquo;t
    particular; she wouldn&rsquo;t mind it a bit if we came home late once in
    a way&mdash;she was used to that, in fact; she liked to see young fellows
    enjoying themselves. We afterwards found out that he got so much on every
    boarder he captured. We also found out&mdash;after paying in advance&mdash;that
    her gentlemen generally sent out their white things to be done; she only
    did the coloured things, so we had to pay a couple of bob extra a week to
    have our &ldquo;biled&rdquo; rags and collars sent out and done; and after
    the first week they bore sad evidence of having been done on the premises
    by one of the frowsy daughters. But we paid all the same. And, good Lord!
    if she keeps the best table in town, we are curious to see the worst. When
    you go down to breakfast you find on the table in front of your chair a cold
    plate, with a black something&mdash;God knows what it looks like&mdash;in
    the centre of it. It eats like something scraped off the inside of a hide
    and burnt; and with this you have a cup of warm grey slush called a &ldquo;cup
    of tea.&rdquo; Dinner: A slice of alleged roast beef or boiled mutton, of
    no particular colour or taste; three new spuds, of which the largest is about
    the size of an ordinary hen&rsquo;s egg, the smallest that of a bantam&rsquo;s,
    and the middle one in between, and which eat soggy and have no taste to speak
    of, save that they are a trifle bitter; a dab of unhealthy-looking green
    something, which might be either cabbage leaves or turnip-tops, and a glass
    of water. The whole mess is lukewarm, including the water&mdash;it would
    all be better cold. Tea: A thin slice of the aforesaid alleged roast or mutton,
    and the pick of about six thin slices of stale bread&mdash;evidently cut
    the day before yesterday. This is the way Mrs Jones  &ldquo;does&rdquo; for
    us for eighteen shillings a week. The bread gave out at tea-time this evening,
    and a mild financial boarder tapped his plate with his knife, and sent the
    bread plate out to be replenished. It came back with <i>one</i> slice on
    it.</p>
  <p>The mild financial boarder, with desperate courage, is telling the landlady
    that he&rsquo;ll have to shift next week&mdash;it is too far to go to work,
    he cannot always get down in time; he is very sorry he has to go, he says;
    he is very comfortable here, but it can&rsquo;t be helped; anyway, as soon
    as he can get work nearer, he&rsquo;ll come back at once; also (oh, what
    cowards men are when women are concerned), he says he wishes she could shift
    and take a house down at the other end of the town. She says (at least here
    are some fragments of her gabble which we caught and shorthanded):  &ldquo;Well,
    I&rsquo;m very sorry to lose you, Mr Sampson, very sorry indeed; but of course
    if you must go, you must. Of course you can&rsquo;t be expected to walk that
    distance every morning, and you mustn&rsquo;t be getting to work late, and
    losing your place... Of course we could get breakfast an hour earlier if...
    well, as I said before, I&rsquo;m sorry to lose you and, indeed... You won&rsquo;t
    forget to come and see us... glad to see you at any time... Well, any way,
    if you ever want to come back, you know, your bed will be always ready for
    you, and you&rsquo;ll be treated just the same, and made just as comfortable&mdash;you
    won&rsquo;t forget that&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and you won&rsquo;t
    forget to come to dinner sometimes&rdquo; (he says he won&rsquo;t); &ldquo;and,
    of course... You know I always try... Don&rsquo;t forget to drop in sometimes...
    Well, anyway, if you ever do happen to hear of a decent young fellow who
    wants a good, clean, comfortable home, you&rsquo;ll be sure to send him to
    me, will you?&rdquo; (He says he will.) &ldquo;Well, of course, Mr Sampson,
    etc., etc., etc., and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on, and-so-on,...&rdquo; It&rsquo;s
    enough to give a man rats.</p>
  <p>He escapes, and we regard his departure very much as a gang of hopeless
    convicts might regard the unexpected liberation of one of their number.</p>
  <p>This is the sort of life that gives a man a God-Almighty longing to break
    away and take to the bush.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HisColonialOath"></a>His Colonial Oath</b></h2>
  <p>I lately met an old schoolmate of mine up-country. He was much changed.
    He was tall and lank, and had the most hideous bristly red beard I ever saw.
    He was working on his father&rsquo;s farm. He shook hands, looked anywhere
    but in my face&mdash;and said nothing. Presently I remarked at a venture &ldquo;So
    poor old Mr B., the schoolmaster, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo; he replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was a good old sort.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Time goes by pretty quick, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His oath (colonial).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor old Mr B. died awfully sudden, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked up the hill, and said: &ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he added: &ldquo;My blooming oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought, perhaps, my city rig or manner embarrassed him, so I stuck my
    hands in my pockets, spat, and said, to set him at his ease: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    blanky hot to-day. I don&rsquo;t know how you blanky blanks stand such blank
    weather! It&rsquo;s blanky well hot enough to roast a crimson carnal bullock;
    ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; Then I took out a cake of tobacco, bit off a quarter,
    and pretended to chew. He replied:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The conversation flagged here. But presently, to my great surprise, he came
    to the rescue with:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He finished me, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Finished? How? Who?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked down towards the river, thought (if he did think) and said:  &ldquo;Finished
    me edyercation, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! you mean Mr B.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath&mdash;he finished me first-rate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned out a good many scholars, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! I&rsquo;m thinkin&rsquo; about going down to the trainin&rsquo; school.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to&mdash;I would if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Those were good old times,&rdquo; I hazarded, &ldquo;you remember
    the old bark school?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked away across the sidling, and was evidently getting uneasy. He
    shifted about, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re pretty busy now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! So long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, good-bye. We must have a yarn some day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He got away as quickly as he could.</p>
  <p>I wonder whether he <i>was</i> changed after all&mdash;or, was it I? A man
    does seem to get out of touch with the bush after living in cities for eight
    or ten years.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVisitOfCondolence"></a>A Visit Of Condolence</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Does Arvie live here, old woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Strike me dead! carn&rsquo;t yer answer a civil queschin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How dare you talk to me like that, you young larrikin! Be off! or
    I&rsquo;ll send for a policeman.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>&ldquo;What do you want with Arvie? Do you know him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! Don&rsquo;t he work at Grinder Brothers? I only come out
    of my way to do him a good turn; an&rsquo; now I&rsquo;m sorry I come&mdash;damned
    if I ain&rsquo;t&mdash;to be barracked like this, an&rsquo; shoved down my
    own throat. (<i>Pause</i>) I want to tell Arvie that if he don&rsquo;t come
    ter work termorrer, another bloke&rsquo;ll collar his job. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    like to see a cove collar a cove&rsquo;s job an&rsquo; not tell a bloke about
    it. What&rsquo;s up with Arvie, anyhow? Is he sick?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christ! (<i>Pause</i>) Garn! What-yer-giv&rsquo;n-us? Tell Arvie
    Bill Anderson wants-ter see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God! haven&rsquo;t I got enough trouble without a young wretch
    like you coming to torment me? For God&rsquo;s sake go away and leave me
    alone! I&rsquo;m telling you the truth, my my poor boy died of influenza
    last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The ragged young rip gave a long, low whistle, glanced up and down Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley, spat out some tobacco-juice, and said &ldquo;Swelp me Gord! I&rsquo;m
    sorry, mum. I didn&rsquo;t know. How was I to know you wasn&rsquo;t havin&rsquo; me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He withdrew one hand from his pocket and scratched the back of his head,
    tilting his hat as far forward as it had previously been to the rear, and
    just then the dilapidated side of his right boot attracted his attention.
    He turned the foot on one side, and squinted at the sole; then he raised
    the foot to his left knee, caught the ankle in a very dirty hand, and regarded
    the sole-leather critically, as though calculating how long it would last.
    After which he spat desperately at the pavement, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kin I see him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He followed her up the crooked little staircase with a who&rsquo;s-afraid
    kind of swagger, but he took his hat off on entering the room.</p>
  <p>He glanced round, and seemed to take stock of the signs of poverty&mdash;so
    familiar to his class&mdash;and then directed his gaze to where the body
    lay on the sofa with its pauper coffin already by its side. He looked at
    the coffin with the critical eye of a tradesman, then he looked at Arvie,
    and then at the coffin again, as if calculating whether the body would fit.</p>
  <p>The mother uncovered the white, pinched face of the dead boy, and Bill came
    and stood by the sofa. He carelessly drew his right hand from his pocket,
    and laid the palm on Arvie&rsquo;s ice-cold forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor little cove!&rdquo; Bill muttered, half to himself; and then,
    as though ashamed of his weakness, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t no post mortem, was there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;a doctor saw him the day before&mdash;there
    was no post mortem.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought there wasn&rsquo;t none,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;because
    a man that&rsquo;s been post mortemed always looks as if he&rsquo;d been
    hurt. My father looked right enough at first&mdash;just as if he was restin&rsquo;&mdash;but
    after they&rsquo;d had him opened he looked as if he&rsquo;d been hurt. No
    one else could see it, but I could. How old was Arvie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m twelve&mdash;goin&rsquo; on for thirteen. Arvie&rsquo;s
    father&rsquo;s dead, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine. Died at his work, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;d mine. Arvie told me his father died of something with
    his heart!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;d mine; ain&rsquo;t it rum? You scrub offices an&rsquo; wash,
    don&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does my mother. You find it pretty hard to get a livin&rsquo;,
    don&rsquo;t yer, these times?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God, yes! God only knows what I&rsquo;ll do now my poor boy&rsquo;s
    gone. I generally get up at half-past five to scrub out some offices, and
    when that&rsquo;s done I&rsquo;ve got to start my day&rsquo;s work, washing.
    And then I find it hard to make both ends meet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does my mother. I suppose you took on bad when yer husband was
    brought home?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, my God! Yes. I&rsquo;ll never forget it till my dying day. My
    poor husband had been out of work for weeks, and he only got the job two
    days before he died. I suppose it gave your mother a great shock?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! One of the fellows that carried father home said: &lsquo;Yer
    husband&rsquo;s dead, mum,&rsquo; he says; &lsquo;he dropped off all of a
    suddint,&rsquo; and mother said, &lsquo;My God! my God!&rsquo; just like
    that, and went off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor soul! poor soul! And&mdash;now my Arvie&rsquo;s gone. Whatever
    will me and the children do? Whatever will I do? Whatever will I do? My God!
    I wish I was under the turf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, mum!&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use frettin&rsquo; over
    what&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He wiped some tobacco-juice off his lips with the back of his hand, and
    regarded the stains reflectively for a minute or so. Then he looked at Arvie
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should ha&rsquo; tried cod liver oil,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He needed rest and plenty of good food.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wasn&rsquo;t very strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, he was not, poor boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought he wasn&rsquo;t. They treated him bad at Grinder Brothers:
    they didn&rsquo;t give him a show to learn nothing; kept him at the same
    work all the time, and he didn&rsquo;t have cheek enough to arsk the boss
    for a rise, lest he&rsquo;d be sacked. He couldn&rsquo;t fight, an&rsquo; the
    boys used to tease him; they&rsquo;d wait outside the shop to have a lark
    with Arvie. I&rsquo;d like to see &rsquo;em do it to me. He couldn&rsquo;t
    fight; but then, of course, he wasn&rsquo;t strong. They don&rsquo;t bother
    me while I&rsquo;m strong enough to heave a rock; but then, of course, it
    wasn&rsquo;t Arvie&rsquo;s fault. I s&rsquo;pose he had pluck enough, if
    he hadn&rsquo;t the strength.&rdquo; And Bill regarded the corpse with a
    fatherly and lenient eye.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if I&rsquo;d known this, I&rsquo;d
    sooner have starved than have my poor boy&rsquo;s life tormented out of him
    in such a place. He never complained. My poor, brave-hearted child! He never
    complained! Poor little Arvie! Poor little Arvie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He never told yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;never a word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! You don&rsquo;t say so! P&rsquo;raps he didn&rsquo;t want
    to let you know he couldn&rsquo;t hold his own; but that wasn&rsquo;t his
    fault, I s&rsquo;pose. Y&rsquo;see, he wasn&rsquo;t strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An old print hanging over the bed attracted his attention, and he regarded
    it with critical interest for awhile:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a pickcher like that at home. We lived in Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley wunst&mdash;in that house over there. How d&rsquo;yer like livin&rsquo; in
    Jones&rsquo;s Alley?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it at all. I don&rsquo;t like having to bring
    my children up where there are so many bad houses; but I can&rsquo;t afford
    to go somewhere else and pay higher rent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, there <i>is</i> a good many night-shops round here. But then,&rdquo;  he
    added, reflectively, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find them everywheres. An&rsquo;,
    besides, the kids git sharp, an&rsquo; pick up a good deal in an alley like
    this; &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t do &rsquo;em no harm; it&rsquo;s no use kids bein&rsquo; green
    if they wanter get on in a city. You ain&rsquo;t been in Sydney all yer life,
    have yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. We came from the bush, about five years ago. My poor husband
    thought he could do better in the city. I was brought up in the bush.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought yer was. Well, men are sick fools. I&rsquo;m thinking about
    gittin&rsquo;  a billet up-country, myself, soon. Where&rsquo;s he goin&rsquo; ter
    be buried?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At Rookwood, to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I carn&rsquo;t come. I&rsquo;ve got ter work. Is the Guvmint goin&rsquo; to
    bury him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill looked at the body with increased respect. &ldquo;Kin I do anythin&rsquo;  for
    you? Now, don&rsquo;t be frightened to arsk!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Thank you very much, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I must be goin&rsquo;; thank yer fur yer trouble, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble, my boy&mdash;mind the step.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> gone. I&rsquo;ll bring a piece of board round some night
    and mend it for you, if you like; I&rsquo;m learnin&rsquo; the carpenterin&rsquo;;
    I kin nearly make a door. Tell yer what, I&rsquo;ll send the old woman round
    to-night to fix up Arvie and lend yer a hand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you. I suppose your mother&rsquo;s got work and trouble
    enough; I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send her round, anyway; she&rsquo;s a bit rough, but she&rsquo;s
    got a soft gizzard; an&rsquo; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; she enjoys better
    than fixin&rsquo; up a body. Good-bye, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my child.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused at the door, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, mum. Swelp me God! I&rsquo;m sorry. S&rsquo;long,
    an&rsquo; thank yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An awe-stricken child stood on the step, staring at Bill with great brimming
    eyes. He patted it on the head and said &ldquo;Keep yer pecker up, young &rsquo;un!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="InAWetSeason"></a>In A Wet Season</b></h2>
  <p>It was raining&mdash;&ldquo;general rain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The train left Bourke, and then there began the long, long agony of scrub
    and wire fence, with here and there a natural clearing, which seemed even
    more dismal than the funereal &ldquo;timber&rdquo; itself. The only thing
    which might seem in keeping with one of these soddened flats would be the
    ghost of a funeral&mdash;a city funeral with plain hearse and string of cabs&mdash;going
    very slowly across from the scrub on one side to the scrub on the other.
    Sky like a wet, grey blanket; plains like dead seas, save for the tufts of
    coarse grass sticking up out of the water; scrub indescribably dismal&mdash;everything
    damp, dark, and unspeakably dreary.</p>
  <p>Somewhere along here we saw a swagman&rsquo;s camp&mdash;a square of calico
    stretched across a horizontal stick, some rags steaming on another stick
    in front of a fire, and two billies to the leeward of the blaze. We knew
    by instinct that there was a piece of beef in the larger one. Small, hopeless-looking
    man standing with his back to the fire, with his hands behind him, watching
    the train; also, a damp, sorry-looking dingo warming itself and shivering
    by the fire. The rain had held up for a while. We saw two or three similar
    camps further on, forming a temporary suburb of Byrock.</p>
  <p>The population was on the platform in old overcoats and damp, soft felt
    hats; one trooper in a waterproof. The population looked cheerfully and patiently
    dismal. The local push had evidently turned up to see off some fair enslavers
    from the city, who had been up-country for the cheque season, now over. They
    got into another carriage. We were glad when the bell rang.</p>
  <p>The rain recommenced. We saw another swagman about a mile on struggling
    away from the town, through mud and water. He did not seem to have heart
    enough to bother about trying to avoid the worst mud-holes. There was a low-spirited
    dingo at his heels, whose sole object in life was seemingly to keep his front
    paws in his master&rsquo;s last footprint. The traveller&rsquo;s body was
    bent well forward from the hips up; his long arms&mdash;about six inches
    through his coat sleeves&mdash;hung by his sides like the arms of a dummy,
    with a billy at the end of one and a bag at the end of the other; but his
    head was thrown back against the top end of the swag, his hat-brim rolled
    up in front, and we saw a ghastly, beardless face which turned neither to
    the right nor the left as the train passed him.</p>
  <p>After a long while we closed our book, and looking through the window, saw
    a hawker&rsquo;s turn-out which was too sorrowful for description.</p>
  <p>We looked out again while the train was going slowly, and saw a teamster&rsquo;s
    camp: three or four wagons covered with tarpaulins which hung down in the
    mud all round and suggested death. A long, narrow man, in a long, narrow,
    shoddy overcoat and a damp felt hat, was walking quickly along the road past
    the camp. A sort of cattle-dog glided silently and swiftly out from under
    a wagon, &ldquo;heeled&rdquo; the man, and slithered back without explaining.
    Here the scene vanished.</p>
  <p>We remember stopping&mdash;for an age it seemed&mdash;at half a dozen straggling
    shanties on a flat of mud and water. There was a rotten weather-board pub,
    with a low, dripping veranda, and three wretchedly forlorn horses hanging,
    in the rain, to a post outside. We saw no more, but we knew that there were
    several apologies for men hanging about the rickety bar inside&mdash;or round
    the parlour fire. Streams of cold, clay-coloured water ran in all directions,
    cutting fresh gutters, and raising a yeasty froth whenever the water fell
    a few inches. As we left, we saw a big man in an overcoat riding across a
    culvert; the tails of the coat spread over the horse&rsquo;s rump, and almost
    hid it. In fancy still we saw him&mdash;hanging up his weary, hungry little
    horse in the rain, and swaggering into the bar; and we almost heard someone
    say, in a drawling tone: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Tom! &rsquo;Ow are yer poppin&rsquo; up?&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>The train stopped (for about a year) within a mile of the next station.
    Trucking-yards in the foreground, like any other trucking-yard along the
    line; they looked drearier than usual, because the rain had darkened the
    posts and rails. Small plain beyond, covered with water and tufts of grass.
    The inevitable, God-forgotten  &ldquo;timber,&rdquo; black in the distance;
    dull, grey sky and misty rain over all. A small, dark-looking flock of sheep
    was crawling slowly in across the flat from the unknown, with three men on
    horse-back zigzagging patiently behind. The horses just moved&mdash;that
    was all. One man wore an oilskin, one an old tweed overcoat, and the third
    had a three-bushel bag over his head and shoulders.</p>
  <p>Had we returned an hour later, we should have seen the sheep huddled together
    in a corner of the yard, and the three horses hanging up outside the local
    shanty.</p>
  <p>We stayed at Nyngan&mdash;which place we refrain from sketching&mdash;for
    a few hours, because the five trucks of cattle of which we were in charge
    were shunted there, to be taken on by a very subsequent goods train. The
    Government allows one man to every five trucks in a cattle-train. We shall
    pay our fare next time, even if we have not a shilling left over and above.
    We had haunted local influence at Comanavadrink for two long, anxious, heart-breaking
    weeks ere we got the pass; and we had put up with all the indignities, the
    humiliation&mdash;in short, had suffered all that poor devils suffer whilst
    besieging Local Influence. We only thought of escaping from the bush.</p>
  <p>The pass said that we were John Smith, drover, and that we were available
    for return by ordinary passenger-train within two days, we think&mdash;or
    words in that direction. Which didn&rsquo;t interest us. We might have given
    the pass away to an unemployed in Orange, who wanted to go out back, and
    who begged for it with tears in his eyes; but we didn&rsquo;t like to injure
    a poor fool who never injured us&mdash;who was an entire stranger to us.
    He didn&rsquo;t know what Out Back meant.</p>
  <p>Local Influence had given us a kind of note of introduction to be delivered
    to the cattle-agent at the yards that morning; but the agent was not there&mdash;only
    two of his satellites, a Cockney colonial-experience man, and a scrub-town
    clerk, both of whom we kindly ignore. We got on without the note, and at
    Orange we amused ourself by reading it. It said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear Old Man&mdash;Please send this beggar on; and I hope he&rsquo;ll
    be landed safely at Orange&mdash;or&mdash;or wherever the cattle go&mdash;yours,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We had been led to believe that the bullocks were going to Sydney. We took
    no further interest in those cattle.</p>
  <p>After Nyngan the bush grew darker and drearier; and the plains more like
    ghastly oceans; and here and there the &ldquo;dominant note of Australian
    scenery&rdquo;  was accentuated, as it were, by naked, white, ring-barked
    trees standing in the water and haunting the ghostly surroundings.</p>
  <p>We spent that night in a passenger compartment of a van which had been originally
    attached to old No. 1 engine. There was only one damp cushion in the whole
    concern. We lent that to a lady who travelled for a few hours in the other
    half of the next compartment. The seats were about nine inches wide and sloped
    in at a sharp angle to the bare matchboard wall, with a bead on the outer
    edge; and as the cracks had become well caulked with the grease and dirt
    of generations, they held several gallons of water each. We scuttled one,
    rolled ourself in a rug, and tried to sleep; but all night long overcoated
    and comfortered bushmen would get in, let down all the windows, and then
    get out again at the next station. Then we would wake up frozen and shut
    the windows.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and woke at daylight, and recognized the ridgy gum-country
    between Dubbo and Orange. It didn&rsquo;t look any drearier than the country
    further west&mdash;because it couldn&rsquo;t. There is scarcely a part of
    the country out west which looks less inviting or more horrible than any
    other part.</p>
  <p>The weather cleared, and we had sunlight for Orange, Bathurst, the Blue
    Mountains, and Sydney. They deserve it; also as much rain as they need.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Rats"></a>&ldquo;Rats&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s two of them, and they&rsquo;re having a fight!
    Come on.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed a strange place for a fight&mdash;that hot, lonely, cotton-bush
    plain. And yet not more than half a mile ahead there were apparently two
    men struggling together on the track.</p>
  <p>The three travellers postponed their smoke-ho and hurried on. They were
    shearers&mdash;a little man and a big man, known respectively as &ldquo;Sunlight&rdquo; and &ldquo;Macquarie,&rdquo;  and
    a tall, thin, young jackeroo whom they called &ldquo;Milky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where the other man sprang from? I didn&rsquo;t see him
    before,&rdquo;  said Sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He muster bin layin&rsquo; down in the bushes,&rdquo; said Macquarie. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
    goin&rsquo; at it proper, too. Come on! Hurry up and see the fun!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They hurried on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a funny-lookin&rsquo; feller, the other feller,&rdquo; panted
    Milky. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t seem to have no head. Look! he&rsquo;s down&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    both down! They must ha&rsquo; clinched on the ground. No! they&rsquo;re
    up an&rsquo; at it again.... Why, good Lord! I think the other&rsquo;s a
    woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! so it is!&rdquo; yelled Sunlight. &ldquo;Look! the brute&rsquo;s
    got her down again! He&rsquo;s kickin&rsquo; her. Come on, chaps; come on,
    or he&rsquo;ll do for her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They dropped swags, water-bags and all, and raced forward; but presently
    Sunlight, who had the best eyes, slackened his pace and dropped behind. His
    mates glanced back at his face, saw a peculiar expression there, looked ahead
    again, and then dropped into a walk.</p>
  <p>They reached the scene of the trouble, and there stood a little withered
    old man by the track, with his arms folded close up under his chin; he was
    dressed mostly in calico patches; and half a dozen corks, suspended on bits
    of string from the brim of his hat, dangled before his bleared optics to
    scare away the flies. He was scowling malignantly at a stout, dumpy swag
    which lay in the middle of the track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old Rats, what&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Sunlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing, nothing,&rdquo; answered the old man, without looking
    round.  &ldquo;I fell out with my swag, that&rsquo;s all. He knocked me down,
    but I&rsquo;ve settled him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; said Sunlight, winking at his mates, &ldquo;we
    saw you jump on him when he was down. That ain&rsquo;t fair, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you didn&rsquo;t see it all,&rdquo; cried Rats, getting excited. &ldquo;He
    hit <i>me</i> down first! And look here, I&rsquo;ll fight him again for nothing,
    and you can see fair play.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They talked awhile; then Sunlight proposed to second the swag, while his
    mate supported the old man, and after some persuasion, Milky agreed, for
    the sake of the lark, to act as time-keeper and referee.</p>
  <p>Rats entered into the spirit of the thing; he stripped to the waist, and
    while he was getting ready the travellers pretended to bet on the result.</p>
  <p>Macquarie took his place behind the old man, and Sunlight up-ended the swag.
    Rats shaped and danced round; then he rushed, feinted, ducked, retreated,
    darted in once more, and suddenly went down like a shot on the broad of his
    back. No actor could have done it better; he went down from that imaginary
    blow as if a cannon-ball had struck him in the forehead.</p>
  <p>Milky called time, and the old man came up, looking shaky. However, he got
    in a tremendous blow which knocked the swag into the bushes.</p>
  <p>Several rounds followed with varying success.</p>
  <p>The men pretended to get more and more excited, and betted freely; and Rats
    did his best. At last they got tired of the fun, Sunlight let the swag lie
    after Milky called time, and the jackaroo awarded the fight to Rats. They
    pretended to hand over the stakes, and then went back for their swags, while
    the old man put on his shirt.</p>
  <p>Then he calmed down, carried his swag to the side of the track, sat down
    on it and talked rationally about bush matters for a while; but presently
    he grew silent and began to feel his muscles and smile idiotically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you len&rsquo; us a bit o&rsquo; meat?&rdquo; said he suddenly.</p>
  <p>They spared him half a pound; but he said he didn&rsquo;t want it all, and
    cut off about an ounce, which he laid on the end of his swag. Then he took
    the lid off his billy and produced a fishing-line. He baited the hook, threw
    the line across the track, and waited for a bite. Soon he got deeply interested
    in the line, jerked it once or twice, and drew it in rapidly. The bait had
    been rubbed off in the grass. The old man regarded the hook disgustedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I had him, only I was in such
    a hurry. I should ha&rsquo; played him a little more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Next time he was more careful. He drew the line in warily, grabbed an imaginary
    fish and laid it down on the grass. Sunlight and Co. were greatly interested
    by this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot yer think o&rsquo; that?&rdquo; asked Rats. &ldquo;It weighs
    thirty pound if it weighs an ounce! Wot yer think o&rsquo; that for a cod?
    The hook&rsquo;s half-way down his blessed gullet!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He caught several cod and a bream while they were there, and invited them
    to camp and have tea with him. But they wished to reach a certain shed next
    day, so&mdash;after the ancient had borrowed about a pound of meat for bait&mdash;they
    went on, and left him fishing contentedly.</p>
  <p>But first Sunlight went down into his pocket and came up with half a crown,
    which he gave to the old man, along with some tucker. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    best push on to the water before dark, old chap,&rdquo; he said, kindly.</p>
  <p>When they turned their heads again, Rats was still fishing but when they
    looked back for the last time before entering the timber, he was having another
    row with his swag; and Sunlight reckoned that the trouble arose out of some
    lies which the swag had been telling about the bigger fish it caught.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellACharacterSketch"></a>Mitchell: A Character Sketch</b></h2>
  <p>It was a very mean station, and Mitchell thought he had better go himself
    and beard the overseer for tucker. His mates were for waiting till the overseer
    went out on the run, and then trying their luck with the cook; but the self-assertive
    and diplomatic Mitchell decided to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the manager.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    suppose it&rsquo;s any use asking you for a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t ask you,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose you want any fencing done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor boundary-riding&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t likely to want a man to knock round?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought not. Things are pretty bad just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Na&mdash;yes&mdash;they are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well; there&rsquo;s a lot to be said on the squatter&rsquo;s
    side as well as the men&rsquo;s. I suppose I can get a bit of rations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-yes.&rdquo; (<i>Shortly</i>)&mdash;&ldquo;Wot d&rsquo;yer want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see; we want a bit of meat and flour&mdash;I think
    that&rsquo;s all. Got enough tea and sugar to carry us on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Cook! have you got any meat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To Mitchell: &ldquo;Can you kill a sheep?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To the cook: &ldquo;Give this man a cloth and knife and steel, and let him
    go up to the yard and kill a sheep.&rdquo; (To Mitchell) &ldquo;You can take
    a fore-quarter and get a bit of flour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Mitchell came back with the carcass wrapped in the cloth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here yer are; here&rsquo;s your sheep,&rdquo; he said to the cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    all right; hang it in there. Did you take a forequarter?&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you? The boss told you to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want a fore-quarter. I don&rsquo;t like it. I took
    a hind-quarter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So he had.</p>
  <p>The cook scratched his head; he seemed to have nothing to say. He thought
    about trying to think, perhaps, but gave it best. It was too hot and he was
    out of practice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, fill these up, will you?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    the tea-bag, and that&rsquo;s the sugar-bag, and that&rsquo;s the flour-bag.&rdquo; He
    had taken them from the front of his shirt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened to stretch &rsquo;em a little, old man.
    I&rsquo;ve got two mates to feed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cook took the bags mechanically and filled them well before he knew
    what he was doing. Mitchell talked all the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said he&mdash;&ldquo;got a bit of baking-powder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-yes, here you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you. Find it dull here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, pretty dull. There&rsquo;s a bit of cooked beef and some
    bread and cake there, if you want it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sweeping the broken victuals into an
    old pillow-slip which he carried on his person for such an emergency. &ldquo;I
    s&rsquo;pose you find it dull round here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, pretty dull.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No one to talk to much?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not many.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tongue gets rusty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;es, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, so long, and thank yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So long,&rdquo; said the cook (he nearly added &ldquo;thank yer&rdquo;).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, good day; I&rsquo;ll see you again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell shouldered his spoil and left.</p>
  <p>The cook scratched his head; he had a chat with the overseer afterwards,
    and they agreed that the traveller was a bit gone.</p>
  <p>But Mitchell&rsquo;s head wasn&rsquo;t gone&mdash;not much: he had been
    round a bit&mdash;that was all.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBushUndertaker"></a>The Bush Undertaker</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man shaded his eyes and peered through the dazzling glow of that
    broiling Christmas Day. He stood just within the door of a slab-and-bark
    hut situated upon the bank of a barren creek; sheep-yards lay to the right,
    and a low line of bare, brown ridges formed a suitable background to the
    scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five Bob!&rdquo; shouted he again; and a dusty sheep-dog rose wearily
    from the shaded side of the hut and looked inquiringly at his master, who
    pointed towards some sheep which were straggling from the flock.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fetch &rsquo;em back,&rdquo; he said confidently.</p>
  <p>The dog went off, and his master returned to the interior of the hut.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;the
    super won&rsquo;t know. We&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em early, and have the arternoon
    to ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get dinner,&rdquo; he added, glancing at some pots on
    the fire. &ldquo;I cud do a bit of doughboy, an&rsquo; that theer boggabri&rsquo;ll
    eat like tater-marrer along of the salt meat.&rdquo; He moved one of the
    black buckets from the blaze. &ldquo;I likes to keep it jist on the sizzle,&rdquo; he
    said in explanation to himself; &ldquo;hard bilin&rsquo; makes it tough&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    keep it jist a-simmerin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here his soliloquy was interrupted by the return of the dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Five Bob,&rdquo; said the hatter, &ldquo;dinner&rsquo;ll
    be ready dreckly. Jist keep yer eye on the sheep till I calls yer; keep &rsquo;em
    well rounded up, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll yard &rsquo;em afterwards and have
    a holiday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This speech was accompanied by a gesture evidently intelligible, for the
    dog retired as though he understood English, and the cooking proceeded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a pick an&rsquo; shovel with me an&rsquo; root up
    that old blackfellow,&rdquo;  mused the shepherd, evidently following up
    a recent train of thought; &ldquo;I reckon it&rsquo;ll do now. I&rsquo;ll
    put in the spuds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The last sentence referred to the cooking, the first to a blackfellow&rsquo;s
    grave about which he was curious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sheep&rsquo;s a-campin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the soliloquizer,
    glancing through the door. &ldquo;So me an&rsquo; Five Bob&rsquo;ll be able
    to get our dinner in peace. I wish I had just enough fat to make the pan
    siss; I&rsquo;d treat myself to a leather-jacket; but it took three weeks&rsquo; skimmin&rsquo; to
    get enough for them theer doughboys.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In due time the dinner was dished up; and the old man seated himself on
    a block, with the lid of a gin-case across his knees for a table. Five Bob
    squatted opposite with the liveliest interest and appreciation depicted on
    his intelligent countenance.</p>
  <p>Dinner proceeded very quietly, except when the carver paused to ask the
    dog how some tasty morsel went with him, and Five Bob&rsquo;s tail declared
    that it went very well indeed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, try this,&rdquo; cried the old man, tossing him
    a large piece of doughboy. A click of Five Bob&rsquo;s jaws and the dough
    was gone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Clean into his liver!&rdquo; said the old man with a faint smile.
    He washed up the tinware in the water the duff had been boiled in, and then,
    with the assistance of the dog, yarded the sheep.</p>
  <p>This accomplished, he took a pick and shovel and an old sack, and started
    out over the ridge, followed, of course, by his four-legged mate. After tramping
    some three miles he reached a spur, running out from the main ridge. At the
    extreme end of this, under some gum-trees, was a little mound of earth, barely
    defined in the grass, and indented in the centre as all blackfellows&rsquo; graves
    were.</p>
  <p>He set to work to dig it up, and sure enough, in about half an hour he bottomed
    on payable dirt.</p>
  <p>When he had raked up all the bones, he amused himself by putting them together
    on the grass and by speculating as to whether they had belonged to black
    or white, male or female. Failing, however, to arrive at any satisfactory
    conclusion, he dusted them with great care, put them in the bag, and started
    for home.</p>
  <p>He took a short cut this time over the ridge and down a gully which was
    full of ring-barked trees and long white grass. He had nearly reached its
    mouth when a great greasy black goanna clambered up a sapling from under
    his feet and looked fightable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dang the jumpt-up thing!&rdquo; cried the old man. &ldquo;It &rsquo;gin
    me a start!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At the foot of the sapling he espied an object which he at first thought
    was the blackened carcass of a sheep, but on closer examination discovered
    to be the body of a man; it lay with its forehead resting on its hands, dried
    to a mummy by the intense heat of the western summer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Me luck&rsquo;s in for the day and no mistake!&rdquo; said the shepherd,
    scratching the back of his head, while he took stock of the remains. He picked
    up a stick and tapped the body on the shoulder; the flesh sounded like leather.
    He turned it over on its side; it fell flat on its back like a board, and
    the shrivelled eyes seemed to peer up at him from under the blackened wrists.</p>
  <p>He stepped back involuntarily, but, recovering himself, leant on his stick
    and took in all the ghastly details.</p>
  <p>There was nothing in the blackened features to tell aught of name or race,
    but the dress proclaimed the remains to be those of a European. The old man
    caught sight of a black bottle in the grass, close beside the corpse. This
    set him thinking. Presently he knelt down and examined the soles of the dead
    man&rsquo;s blucher boots, and then, rising with an air of conviction, exclaimed: &ldquo;Brummy!
    by gosh!&mdash;busted up at last!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tole yer so, Brummy,&rdquo; he said impressively, addressing the
    corpse.  &ldquo;I allers told yer as how it &rsquo;ud be&mdash;an&rsquo; here
    y&rsquo;are, you thundering jumpt-up cuss-o&rsquo;-God fool. Yer cud earn
    more&rsquo;n any man in the colony, but yer&rsquo;d lush it all away. I allers
    sed as how it &rsquo;ud end, an&rsquo; now yer kin see fur y&rsquo;self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect yer was a-comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me t&rsquo; get fixt up an&rsquo; set
    straight agin; then yer was a-goin&rsquo; to swear off, same as yer &rsquo;allers
    did; an&rsquo; here y&rsquo;are, an&rsquo;  now I expect I&rsquo;ll have
    t&rsquo; fix yer up for the last time an&rsquo; make yer decent, for  &rsquo;twon&rsquo;t
    do t&rsquo; leave yer alyin&rsquo; out here like a dead sheep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He picked up the corked bottle and examined it. To his great surprise it
    was nearly full of rum.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, this gits me,&rdquo; exclaimed the old man; &ldquo;me luck&rsquo;s
    in, this Christmas, an&rsquo; no mistake. He must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got the
    jams early in his spree, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be a-making for me with near
    a bottleful left. Howsomenever, here goes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Looking round, his eyes lit up with satisfaction as he saw some bits of
    bark which had been left by a party of strippers who had been getting bark
    there for the stations. He picked up two pieces, one about four and the other
    six feet long, and each about two feet wide, and brought them over to the
    body. He laid the longest strip by the side of the corpse, which he proceeded
    to lift on to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Brummy,&rdquo; he said, in a softer tone than usual, &ldquo;ye
    ain&rsquo;t as bad as yer might be, considerin&rsquo; as it must be three
    good months since yer slipped yer wind. I spect it was the rum as preserved
    yer. It was the death of yer when yer was alive, an&rsquo; now yer dead,
    it preserves yer like&mdash;like a mummy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he placed the other strip on top, with the hollow side downwards&mdash;thus
    sandwiching the defunct between the two pieces&mdash;removed the saddle-strap,
    which he wore for a belt, and buckled it round one end, while he tried to
    think of something with which to tie up the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take any more strips off my shirt,&rdquo; he said,
    critically examining the skirts of the old blue overshirt he wore. &ldquo;I
    might get a strip or two more off, but it&rsquo;s short enough already. Let&rsquo;s
    see; how long have I been a-wearin&rsquo; of that shirt; oh, I remember,
    I bought it jist two days afore Five Bob was pupped. I can&rsquo;t afford
    a new shirt jist yet; howsomenever, seein&rsquo; it&rsquo;s Brummy, I&rsquo;ll
    jist borrow a couple more strips and sew &rsquo;em on agen when I git home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He up-ended Brummy, and placing his shoulder against the middle of the lower
    sheet of bark, lifted the corpse to a horizontal position; then, taking the
    bag of bones in his hand, he started for home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a-spendin&rsquo; sech a dull Christmas arter all,&rdquo; he
    reflected, as he plodded on; but he had not walked above a hundred yards
    when he saw a black goanna sidling into the grass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another of them theer dang things!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    two I&rsquo;ve seed this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently he remarked: &ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t smell none too sweet, Brummy.
    It must &rsquo;a&rsquo; been jist about the middle of shearin&rsquo; when
    yer pegged out. I wonder who got yer last cheque. Shoo! theer&rsquo;s another
    black goanner&mdash;theer must be a flock of  &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rested Brummy on the ground while he had another pull at the bottle,
    and, before going on, packed the bag of bones on his shoulder under the body,
    and he soon stopped again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up bones is all skew-whift,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ole on, Brummy, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em&rdquo;&mdash;and
    he leaned the dead man against a tree while he settled the bones on his shoulder,
    and took another pull at the bottle.</p>
  <p>About a mile further on he heard a rustling in the grass to the right, and,
    looking round, saw another goanna gliding off sideways, with its long snaky
    neck turned towards him.</p>
  <p>This puzzled the shepherd considerably, the strangest part of it being that
    Five Bob wouldn&rsquo;t touch the reptile, but slunk off with his tail down
    when ordered to &ldquo;sick &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s sothin&rsquo; comic about them theer goanners,&rdquo; said
    the old man at last. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seed swarms of grasshoppers an&rsquo; big
    mobs of kangaroos, but dang me if ever I seed a flock of black goanners afore!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On reaching the hut the old man dumped the corpse against the wall, wrong
    end up, and stood scratching his head while he endeavoured to collect his
    muddled thoughts; but he had not placed Brummy at the correct angle, and,
    consequently, that individual fell forward and struck him a violent blow
    on the shoulder with the iron toes of his blucher boots.</p>
  <p>The shock sobered him. He sprang a good yard, instinctively hitching up
    his moleskins in preparation for flight; but a backward glance revealed to
    him the true cause of this supposed attack from the rear. Then he lifted
    the body, stood it on its feet against the chimney, and ruminated as to where
    he should lodge his mate for the night, not noticing that the shorter sheet
    of bark had slipped down on the boots and left the face exposed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I spect I&rsquo;ll have ter put yer into the chimney-trough for the
    night, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, turning round to confront the corpse. &ldquo;Yer
    can&rsquo;t expect me to take yer into the hut, though I did it when yer
    was in a worse state than&mdash;Lord!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The shepherd was not prepared for the awful scrutiny that gleamed on him
    from those empty sockets; his nerves received a shock, and it was some time
    before he recovered himself sufficiently to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look a-here, Brummy,&rdquo; said he, shaking his finger severely
    at the delinquent, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to pick a row with yer; I&rsquo;d
    do as much for yer an&rsquo;  more than any other man, an&rsquo; well yer
    knows it; but if yer starts playin&rsquo; any of yer jumpt-up pranktical
    jokes on me, and a-scarin&rsquo; of me after a-humpin&rsquo; of yer  &rsquo;ome,
    by the &rsquo;oly frost I&rsquo;ll kick yer to jim-rags, so I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This admonition delivered, he hoisted Brummy into the chimney-trough, and
    with a last glance towards the sheep-yards, he retired to his bunk to have,
    as he said, a snooze.</p>
  <p>He had more than a snooze, however, for when he woke, it was dark, and the
    bushman&rsquo;s instinct told him it must be nearly nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>He lit a slush-lamp and poured the remainder of the rum into a pannikin;
    but, just as he was about to lift the draught to his lips, he heard a peculiar
    rustling sound overhead, and put the pot down on the table with a slam that
    spilled some of the precious liquor.</p>
  <p>Five Bob whimpered, and the old shepherd, though used to the weird and dismal,
    as one living alone in the bush must necessarily be, felt the icy breath
    of fear at his heart.</p>
  <p>He reached hastily for his old shot-gun, and went out to investigate. He
    walked round the but several times and examined the roof on all sides, but
    saw nothing. Brummy appeared to be in the same position.</p>
  <p>At last, persuading himself that the noise was caused by possums or the
    wind, the old man went inside, boiled his billy, and, after composing his
    nerves somewhat with a light supper and a meditative smoke, retired for the
    night. He was aroused several times before midnight by the same mysterious
    sound overhead, but, though he rose and examined the roof on each occasion
    by the light of the rising moon, he discovered nothing.</p>
  <p>At last he determined to sit up and watch until daybreak, and for this purpose
    took up a position on a log a short distance from the hut, with his gun laid
    in readiness across his knee.</p>
  <p>After watching for about an hour, he saw a black object coming over the
    ridge-pole. He grabbed his gun and fired. The thing disappeared. He ran round
    to the other side of the hut, and there was a great black goanna in violent
    convulsions on the ground.</p>
  <p>Then the old man saw it all. &ldquo;The thunderin&rsquo; jumpt-up thing
    has been a-havin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The same
    cuss-o&rsquo;-God wretch has a-follered me &rsquo;ome, an&rsquo; has been
    a-havin&rsquo; its Christmas dinner off of Brummy, an&rsquo; a-hauntin&rsquo; o&rsquo; me
    into the bargain, the jumpt-up tinker!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As there was no one by whom he could send a message to the station, and
    the old man dared not leave the sheep and go himself, he determined to bury
    the body the next afternoon, reflecting that the authorities could disinter
    it for inquest if they pleased.</p>
  <p>So he brought the sheep home early and made arrangements for the burial
    by measuring the outer casing of Brummy and digging a hole according to those
    dimensions.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That &rsquo;minds me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I never rightly knowed
    Brummy&rsquo;s religion, blest if ever I did. Howsomenever, there&rsquo;s
    one thing sartin&mdash;none o&rsquo; them theer pianer-fingered parsons is
    a-goin&rsquo; ter take the trouble ter travel out inter this God-forgotten
    part to hold sarvice over him, seein&rsquo; as how his last cheque&rsquo;s
    blued. But, as I&rsquo;ve got the fun&rsquo;ral arrangements all in me own
    hands, I&rsquo;ll do jestice to it, and see that Brummy has a good comfortable
    buryin&rsquo;&mdash;and more&rsquo;s unpossible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time yer turned in, Brum,&rdquo; he said, lifting the
    body down.</p>
  <p>He carried it to the grave and dropped it into one corner like a post. He
    arranged the bark so as to cover the face, and, by means of a piece of clothes-line,
    lowered the body to a horizontal position. Then he threw in an armful of
    gum-leaves, and then, very reluctantly, took the shovel and dropped in a
    few shovelfuls of earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; this is the last of Brummy,&rdquo; he said, leaning on
    his spade and looking away over the tops of the ragged gums on the distant
    range.</p>
  <p>This reflection seemed to engender a flood of memories, in which the old
    man became absorbed. He leaned heavily upon his spade and thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arter all,&rdquo; he murmured sadly, &ldquo;arter all&mdash;it were
    Brummy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brummy,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now; nothin&rsquo; matters
    now&mdash;nothin&rsquo;  didn&rsquo;t ever matter, nor&mdash;nor don&rsquo;t.
    You uster say as how it &rsquo;ud be all right termorrer&rdquo;  (pause); &ldquo;termorrer&rsquo;s
    come, Brummy&mdash;come fur you&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t come fur me yet, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He threw in some more earth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer don&rsquo;t remember, Brummy, an&rsquo; mebbe yer don&rsquo;t
    want to remember&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to remember&mdash;but&mdash;well,
    but, yer see that&rsquo;s where yer got the pull on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shovelled in some more earth and paused again.</p>
  <p>The dog rose, with ears erect, and looked anxiously first at his master
    and then into the grave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Theer oughter be somethin&rsquo; sed,&rdquo; muttered the old man; &ldquo;&rsquo;tain&rsquo;t
    right to put &rsquo;im under like a dog. Theer oughter be some sort o&rsquo; sarmin.&rdquo; He
    sighed heavily in the listening silence that followed this remark and proceeded
    with his work. He filled the grave to the brim this time, and fashioned the
    mound carefully with his spade. Once or twice he muttered the words, &ldquo;I
    am the rassaraction.&rdquo; As he laid the tools quietly aside, and stood
    at the head of the grave, he was evidently trying to remember the something
    that ought to be said. He removed his hat, placed it carefully on the grass,
    held his hands out from his sides and a little to the front, drew a long
    deep breath, and said with a solemnity that greatly disturbed Five Bob: &ldquo;Hashes
    ter hashes, dus ter dus, Brummy&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; in hopes
    of a great an&rsquo; gerlorious rassaraction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down on a log near by, rested his elbows on his knees and passed
    his hand wearily over his forehead&mdash;but only as one who was tired and
    felt the heat; and presently he rose, took up the tools, and walked back
    to the hut.</p>
  <p>And the sun sank again on the grand Australian bush&mdash;the nurse and
    tutor of eccentric minds, the home of the weird.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OurPipes"></a>Our Pipes</b></h2>
  <p>The moon rose away out on the edge of a smoky plain, seen through a sort
    of tunnel or arch in the fringe of mulga behind which we were camped&mdash;Jack
    Mitchell and I. The timber proper was just behind us, very thick and very
    dark. The moon looked like a big new copper boiler set on edge on the horizon
    of the plain, with the top turned towards us and a lot of old rags and straw
    burning inside.</p>
  <p>We had tramped twenty-five miles on a dry stretch on a hot day&mdash;swagmen
    know what that means. We reached the water about two hours &ldquo;after dark&rdquo;&mdash;swagmen
    know what that means. We didn&rsquo;t sit down at once and rest&mdash;we
    hadn&rsquo;t rested for the last ten miles. We knew that if we sat down we
    wouldn&rsquo;t want to get up again in a hurry&mdash;that, if we did, our
    leg-sinews, especially those of our calves, would &ldquo;draw&rdquo;  like
    red-hot wire&rsquo;s. You see, we hadn&rsquo;t been long on the track this
    time&mdash;it was only our third day out. Swagmen will understand.</p>
  <p>We got the billy boiled first, and some leaves laid down for our beds and
    the swags rolled out. We thanked the Lord that we had some cooked meat and
    a few johnny-cakes left, for we didn&rsquo;t feel equal to cooking. We put
    the billy of tea and our tucker-bags between the heads of our beds, and the
    pipes and tobacco in the crown of an old hat, where we could reach them without
    having to get up. Then we lay down on our stomachs and had a feed. We didn&rsquo;t
    eat much&mdash;we were too tired for that&mdash;but we drank a lot of tea.
    We gave our calves time to tone down a bit; then we lit up and began to answer
    each other. It got to be pretty comfortable, so long as we kept those unfortunate
    legs of ours straight and didn&rsquo;t move round much.</p>
  <p>We cursed society because we weren&rsquo;t rich men, and then we felt better
    and conversation drifted lazily round various subjects and ended in that
    of smoking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How I came to start smoking?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    see.&rdquo; He reflected.  &ldquo;I started smoking first when I was about
    fourteen or fifteen. I smoked some sort of weed&mdash;I forget the name of
    it&mdash;but it wasn&rsquo;t tobacco; and then I smoked cigarettes&mdash;not
    the ones we get now, for those cost a penny each. Then I reckoned that, if
    I could smoke those, I could smoke a pipe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We lived in Sydney then&mdash;Surry Hills. Those were different times;
    the place was nearly all sand. The old folks were alive then, and we were
    all at home, except Tom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!... Well, one evening I was playing marbles out in front
    of our house when a chap we knew gave me his pipe to mind while he went into
    a church-meeting. The little church was opposite&mdash;a &lsquo;chapel&rsquo; they
    called it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The pipe was alight. It was a clay pipe and niggerhead tobacco. Mother
    was at work out in the kitchen at the back, washing up the tea-things, and,
    when I went in, she said: &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been smoking!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t deny it&mdash;I was too sick to do so, or
    care much, anyway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Give me that pipe!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said I hadn&rsquo;t got it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<i>Give&mdash;me&mdash;that&mdash;pipe</i>!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said I hadn&rsquo;t got it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where is it?&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jim Brown&rsquo;s got it,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
    his.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll give it to Jim Brown,&rsquo; she said; and
    she did; though it wasn&rsquo;t Jim&rsquo;s fault, for he only gave it to
    me to mind. I didn&rsquo;t smoke the pipe so much because I wanted to smoke
    a pipe just then, as because I had such a great admiration for Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell reflected, and took a look at the moon. It had risen clear and
    had got small and cold and pure-looking, and had floated away back out amongst
    the stars.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I felt better towards morning, but it didn&rsquo;t cure me&mdash;being
    sick and nearly dead all night, I mean. I got a clay pipe and tobacco, and
    the old lady found it and put it in the stove. Then I got another pipe and
    tobacco, and she laid for it, and found it out at last; but she didn&rsquo;t
    put the tobacco in the stove this time&mdash;she&rsquo;d got experience.
    I don&rsquo;t know what she did with it. I tried to find it, but couldn&rsquo;t.
    I fancy the old man got hold of it, for I saw him with a plug that looked
    very much like mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t be done. I got a cherry pipe. I thought it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be so easy to break if she found it. I used to plant the bowl in one place
    and the stem in another because I reckoned that if she found one she mightn&rsquo;t
    find the other. It doesn&rsquo;t look much of an idea now, but it seemed
    like an inspiration then. Kids get rum ideas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was having a smoke out at the back, when I heard
    her coming, and I pulled out the stem in a hurry and put the bowl behind
    the water-butt and the stem under the house. Mother was coming round for
    a dipper of water. I got out of her way quick, for I hadn&rsquo;t time to
    look innocent; but the bowl of the pipe was hot and she got a whiff of it.
    She went sniffing round, first on one side of the cask and then on the other,
    until she got on the scent and followed it up and found the bowl. Then I
    had only the stem left. She looked for that, but she couldn&rsquo;t scent
    it. But I couldn&rsquo;t get much comfort out of that. Have you got the matches?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I gave it best for a time and smoked cigars. They were the safest
    and most satisfactory under the circumstances, but they cost me two shillings
    a week, and I couldn&rsquo;t stand it, so I started a pipe again and then
    mother gave in at last. God bless her, and God forgive me, and us all&mdash;we
    deserve it. She&rsquo;s been at rest these seventeen long years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did your old man do when he found out that you were smoking?&rdquo;  I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he seemed to brighten up at first. You see, he was sort of
    pensioned off by mother and she kept him pretty well inside his income....
    Well, he seemed to sort of brighten up&mdash;liven up&mdash;when he found
    out that I was smoking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did he? So did my old man, and he livened me up, too. But what did
    your old man do&mdash;what did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, very slowly, &ldquo;about the first thing
    he did was to ask me for a fill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! many a solemn, thoughtful old smoke we had together on the quiet&mdash;the
    old man and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is your old man dead, Mitchell?&rdquo; I asked softly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Long
    ago&mdash;these twelve years,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ComingAcross"></a>Coming Across</b><br>
    <font size="+1">A Study in the Steerage</font> </h2>
  <p>We were delayed for an hour or so inside Sydney Heads, taking passengers
    from the <i>Oroya,</i> which had just arrived from England and anchored off
    Watson&rsquo;s Bay. An Adelaide boat went alongside the ocean liner, while
    we dropped anchor at a respectable distance. This puzzled some of us until
    one of the passengers stopped an ancient mariner and inquired. The sailor
    jerked his thumb upwards, and left. The passengers stared aloft till some
    of them got the lockjaw in the back of their necks, and then another sailor
    suggested that we had yards to our masts, while the Adelaide boat had not.</p>
  <p>It seemed a pity that the new chums for New Zealand didn&rsquo;t have a
    chance to see Sydney after coming so far and getting so near. It struck them
    that way too. They saw Melbourne, which seemed another injustice to the old
    city. However, nothing matters much nowadays, and they might see Sydney in
    happier times.</p>
  <p>They looked like new chums, especially the &ldquo;furst clarsters,&rdquo; and
    there were two or three Scotsmen among them who looked like Scots, and talked
    like it too; also an Irishman. Great Britain and Ireland do not seem to be
    learning anything fresh about Australia. We had a yarn with one of these
    new arrivals, and got talking about the banks. It turned out that he was
    a radical. He spat over the side and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a something shame the way things is carried on! Now, look
    here, a banker can rob hundreds of wimmin and children an&rsquo; widders
    and orfuns, and nothin&rsquo;  is done to him; but if a poor man only embezzles
    a shilling <i>he gets transported to the colonies for life</i>.&rdquo; The
    italics are ours, but the words were his.</p>
  <p>We explained to this new chum that transportation was done away with long
    ago, as far as Australia was concerned, that no more convicts were sent out
    here&mdash;only men who ought to be; and he seemed surprised. He did not
    call us a liar, but he looked as if he thought that we were prevaricating.
    We were glad that he didn&rsquo;t say so, for he was a bigger man. New chums
    are generally more robust than Australians.</p>
  <p>When we got through the Heads someone pointed to the wrong part of the cliff
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Shortly afterwards another man pointed to another wrong part of the cliffs
    and observed incidentally:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pretty soon a third man came along and pointed to a third wrong part of
    the cliff, and remarked casually:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We moved aft and met the fourth mate, who jerked his thumb over his shoulder
    at the cliffs in general, and muttered condescendingly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not long before a woman turned round and asked &ldquo;Was that the
    place where the Dunbar was wrecked, please?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We said &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and she said &ldquo;Lor,&rdquo; and beckoned
    to a friend.</p>
  <p>We went for&rsquo;ard and met an old sailor, who glared at us, jerked his
    thumb at the coast and growled:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> went down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then we went below; but we felt a slight relief when he said &ldquo;went
    down&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It is doubtful whether a passenger boat ever cleared Sydney Heads since
    the wild night of that famous wreck without someone pointing to the wrong
    part of the cliffs, and remarking:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The <i>Dunbar</i> fiend is inseparable from Australian coasting steamers.</p>
  <p>We travelled second-class in the interests of journalism. You get more points
    for copy in the steerage. It was a sacrifice; but we hope to profit by it
    some day.</p>
  <p>There were about fifty male passengers, including half a dozen New Zealand
    shearers, two of whom came on board drunk&mdash;their remarks for the first
    night mainly consisted of &ldquo;gory.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gory&rdquo; is part
    of the Australian language now&mdash;a big part.</p>
  <p>The others were chiefly tradesmen, labourers, clerks and bagmen, driven
    out of Australia by the hard times there, and glad, no doubt, to get away.
    There was a jeweller on board, of course, and his name was Moses or Cohen.
    If it wasn&rsquo;t it should have been&mdash;or Isaacs. His christian name
    was probably Benjamin. We called him Jacobs. He passed away most of his time
    on board in swopping watch lies with the other passengers and good-naturedly
    spoiling their Waterburys.</p>
  <p>One commercial traveller shipped with a flower in his buttonhole. His girl
    gave it to him on the wharf, and told him to keep it till it faded, and then
    press it. She was a barmaid. She thought he was &ldquo;going saloon,&rdquo; but
    he came forward as soon as the wharf was out of sight. He gave the flower
    to the stewardess, and told us about these things one moonlight night during
    the voyage.</p>
  <p>There was another&mdash;a well-known Sydney man&mdash;whose friends thought
    he was going saloon, and turned up in good force to see him off. He spent
    his last shilling &ldquo;shouting,&rdquo; and kept up his end of the pathetic
    little farce out of consideration for the feelings of certain proud female
    relatives, and not because he was &ldquo;proud&rdquo;&mdash;at least in that
    way. He stood on a conspicuous part of the saloon deck and waved his white
    handkerchief until Miller&rsquo;s Point came between. Then he came forward
    where he belonged. But he was proud&mdash;bitterly so. He had a flower too,
    but he did not give it to the stewardess. He had it pressed, we think (for
    we knew him), and perhaps he wears it now over the place where his heart
    used to be.</p>
  <p>When Australia was fading from view we shed a tear, which was all we had
    to shed; at least, we tried to shed a tear, and could not. It is best to
    be exact when you are writing from experience.</p>
  <p>Just as Australia was fading from view, someone looked through a glass,
    and said in a sad, tired kind of voice that he could just see the place where
    the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>Several passengers were leaning about and saying &ldquo;Europe! E-u-rope!&rdquo;  in
    agonized tones. None of them were going to Europe, and the new chums said
    nothing about it. This reminds us that some people say &ldquo;Asia! Asia!
    Ak-kak-Asia!&rdquo; when somebody spills the pepper. There was a pepper-box
    without a stopper on the table in our cabin. The fact soon attracted attention.</p>
  <p>A new chum came along and asked us whether the Maoris were very bad round
    Sydney. He&rsquo;d heard that they were. We told him that we had never had
    any trouble with them to speak of, and gave him another show.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of the wreck of the <i>Dunbar</i>?&rdquo; we asked.
    He said that he never &ldquo;heerd tell&rdquo; of it, but he had heerd of
    the wreck of the <i>Victoria</i>.</p>
  <p>We gave him best.</p>
  <p>The first evening passed off quietly, except for the vinously-excited shearers.
    They had sworn eternal friendship with a convivial dude from the saloon,
    and he made a fine specimen fool of himself for an hour or so. He never showed
    his nose for&rsquo;ard again.</p>
  <p>Now and then a passenger would solemnly seek the steward and have a beer.
    The steward drew it out of a small keg which lay on its side on a shelf with
    a wooden tap sticking out of the end of it&mdash;out of the end of the keg,
    we mean. The beer tasted like warm but weak vinegar, and cost sixpence per
    small glass. The bagman told the steward that he could not compliment him
    on the quality of his liquor, but the steward said nothing. He did not even
    seem interested&mdash;only bored. He had heard the same remark often before,
    no doubt. He was a fat, solemn steward&mdash;not formal, but very reticent&mdash;unresponsive.
    He looked like a man who had conducted a religious conservative paper once
    and failed, and had then gone into the wholesale produce line, and failed
    again, and finally got his present billet through the influence of his creditors
    and two clergymen. He might have been a sociable fellow, a man about town,
    even a gay young dog, and a radical writer before he was driven to accept
    the editorship of the aforesaid periodical. He probably came of a &ldquo;good
    English family.&rdquo; He was now, very likely, either a rigid Presbyterian
    or an extreme freethinker. He thought a lot, anyway, and looked as if he
    knew a lot too&mdash;too much for words, in fact.</p>
  <p>We took a turn on deck before turning in, and heard two men arguing about
    the way in which the <i>Dunbar</i> was wrecked.</p>
  <p>The commercial travellers, the jeweller, and one or two new chums who were
    well provided with clothing undressed deliberately and retired ostentatiously
    in pyjamas, but there were others&mdash;men of better days&mdash;who turned
    in either very early or very late, when the cabin was quiet, and slipped
    hurriedly and furtively out of their clothes and between the blankets, as
    if they were ashamed of the poverty of their underwear. It is well that the
    Lord can see deep down into the hearts of men, for He has to judge them;
    it is well that the majority of mankind cannot, because, if they could, the
    world would be altogether too sorrowful to live in; and we do not think the
    angels can either, else they would not be happy&mdash;if they could and were
    they would not be angels any longer&mdash;they would be devils. Study it
    out on a slate.</p>
  <p>We turned in feeling comfortably dismal, and almost wishing that we had
    gone down with the <i>Dunbar</i>.</p>
  <p>The intoxicated shearers and the dude kept their concert up till a late
    hour that night&mdash;or, rather, a very early hour next morning; and at
    about midnight they were reinforced by the commercial traveller and Moses,
    the jeweller, who had been visiting acquaintances aft. This push was encouraged
    by voices from various bunks, and enthusiastically barracked for by a sandy-complexioned,
    red-headed comedian with twinkling grey eyes, who occupied the berth immediately
    above our own.</p>
  <p>They stood with their backs to the bunks, and their feet braced against
    the deck, or lurched round, and took friendly pulls from whisky flasks, and
    chyacked each other, and laughed, and blowed, and lied like&mdash;like Australian
    bushmen; and occasionally they broke out into snatches of song&mdash;and
    as often broke down. Few Englishmen know more than the first verse, or two
    lines, of even their most popular song, and, where elevated enough to think
    they can sing, they repeat the first verse over and over again, with the
    wrong words, and with a sort of &ldquo;Ta-ra-ra-rum-ti-tooral, ta-ra-ra-ra-ra-rum-ti,
    ta-ra-ra-rum-tum-ti-rum-rum-tum-ti-dee-e-e,&rdquo; by way of variation.</p>
  <p>Presently&mdash;suddenly, it seemed to our drowsy senses&mdash;two of the
    shearers and the bagman commenced arguing with drunken gravity and precision
    about politics, even while a third bushman was approaching the climax of
    an out-back yarn of many adjectives, of which he himself was the hero. The
    scraps of conversation that we caught were somewhat as follow. We leave out
    most of the adjectives.</p>
  <p>First Voice: &ldquo;Now, look here. The women will vote for men, not principles.
    That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m against women voting. Now, just mark my&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (trying to finish yarn): &ldquo;Hold on. Just wait till I tell
    yer. Well, this bloomin&rsquo; bloke, he says&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (evidently in reply to first): &ldquo;Principles you mean,
    not men. You&rsquo;re getting a bit mixed, old man.&rdquo; (Smothered chuckle
    from comedian over our head.)</p>
  <p>Third Voice (seeming to drift round in search of sympathy): &ldquo;&lsquo;You
    will!&rsquo;  sez I. &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; he sez. &lsquo;Oh, you will,
    will yer?&rsquo; I sez; and with that I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Second Voice (apparently wandering from both subjects) &ldquo;Blanker has
    always stuck up for the workin&rsquo; man, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll get in,
    you&rsquo;ll see. Why, he&rsquo;s a bloomin&rsquo;  workin&rsquo; man himself.
    Me and Blanker&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Disgusted voice from a bunk: &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s damn rot! We&rsquo;ve
    had enough of lumpers in parliament! Horny hands are all right enough, but
    we don&rsquo;t want any more blanky horny heads!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Third Voice (threateningly): &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s talkin&rsquo; about &rsquo;orny
    heads? That pitch is meant for us, ain&rsquo;t it? Do you mean to say that
    I&rsquo;ve got a &rsquo;orny head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here two men commenced snarling at each other, and there was some talk of
    punching the causes of the dispute; but the bagman interfered, a fresh flask
    was passed round, and some more eternal friendship sworn to.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and the next time we were aware of anything the commercial
    and Moses had disappeared, the rest were lying or sitting in their bunks,
    and the third shearer was telling a yarn about an alleged fight he had at
    a shed up-country; and perhaps he was telling it for the benefit of the dissatisfied
    individual who made the injudicious remark concerning horny heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So I said to the boss-over-the-board, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a nice
    sort of a thing,&rsquo;  I sez. &lsquo;Who are you talkin&rsquo; to?&rsquo; he
    says. &lsquo;You, bless yer,&rsquo; I says. &lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo;  he
    says, &lsquo;you get your cheque and clear! &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;you
    can take that!&rsquo;  and I hauled off and landed him a beauty under the
    butt of the listener. Then the boss came along with two blacklegs, but the
    boys made a ring, and I laid out the blanks in just five minutes. Then I
    sez to the boss, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of cove I am,&rsquo; I sez, &rsquo;an&rsquo; now,
    if you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But just here there came a deep, growling voice&mdash;seemingly from out
    of the depths of the forehold&mdash;anyway, there came a voice, and it said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For the Lord&rsquo;s sake give her a rest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electricity, but there were two lanterns dimly
    burning in our part of the steerage. It was a narrow compartment running
    across the width of the boat, and had evidently been partitioned off from
    the top floor of the hold to meet the emigration from Australia to New Zealand.
    There were three tiers of bunks, two deep, on the far side, three rows of
    single bunks on the other, and two at each end of the cabin, the top ones
    just under the portholes.</p>
  <p>The shearers had turned in &ldquo;all standing;&rdquo; two of them were
    lying feet to feet in a couple of outside lower berths. One lay on his stomach
    with his face turned outwards, his arm thrown over the side of the bunk,
    and his knuckles resting on the deck, the other rested on the broad of his
    back with his arm also hanging over the side and his knuckles resting on
    the floor. And so they slept the sleep of the drunk.</p>
  <p>A fair, girl-faced young Swiss emigrant occupied one of the top berths,
    with his curly, flaxen head resting close alongside one of the lanterns that
    were dimly burning, and an Anglo-foreign dictionary in his hand. His mate,
    or brother, who resembled him in everything except that he had dark hair,
    lay asleep alongside; and in the next berth a long consumptive-looking new
    chum sat in his pyjamas, with his legs hanging over the edge, and his hands
    grasping the sideboard, to which, on his right hand, a sort of tin-can arrangement
    was hooked. He was staring intently at nothing, and seemed to be thinking
    very hard.</p>
  <p>We dozed off again, and woke suddenly to find our eyes wide open, and the
    young Swiss still studying, and the jackaroo still sitting in the same position,
    but with a kind of waiting expression on his face&mdash;a sort of expectant
    light in his eyes. Suddenly he lurched for the can, and after awhile he lay
    back looking like a corpse.</p>
  <p>We slept again, and finally awoke to daylight and the clatter of plates.
    All the bunks were vacated except two, which contained corpses, apparently.</p>
  <p>Wet decks, and a round, stiff, morning breeze, blowing strongly across the
    deck, abeam, and gustily through the open portholes. There was a dull grey
    sky, and the sea at first sight seemed to be of a dark blue or green, but
    on closer inspection it took a dirty slate colour, with splashes as of indigo
    in the hollows. There was one of those near, yet far-away horizons.</p>
  <p>About two-thirds of the men were on deck, but the women had not shown up
    yet&mdash;nor did they show up until towards the end of the trip.</p>
  <p>Some of the men were smoking in a sheltered corner, some walking up and
    down, two or three trying to play quoits, one looking at the poultry, one
    standing abaft the purser&rsquo;s cabin with hands in the pockets of his
    long ragged overcoat, watching the engines, and two more&mdash;carpenters&mdash;were
    discussing a big cedar log, about five feet in diameter, which was lashed
    on deck alongside the hatch.</p>
  <p>While we were waiting for the <i>Oroya</i> some of the ship&rsquo;s officers
    came and had a consultation over this log and called up part of the crew,
    who got some more ropes and a chain on to it. It struck us at the time that
    that log would make a sensation if it fetched loose in rough weather. But
    there wasn&rsquo;t any rough weather.</p>
  <p>The fore-cabin was kept clean; the assistant steward was good-humoured and
    obliging; his chief was civil enough to freeze the Never-Never country; but
    the bill of fare was monotonous.</p>
  <p>During the afternoon a first-salooner made himself obnoxious by swelling
    round for&rsquo;ard. He was a big bull-necked &ldquo;Britisher&rdquo; (that
    word covers it) with a bloated face, prominent gooseberry eyes, fore &rsquo;n&rsquo; aft
    cap, and long tan shoes. He seemed as if he&rsquo;d come to see a &ldquo;zoo,&rdquo; and
    was dissatisfied with it&mdash;had a fine contempt for it, in fact, because
    it did not come up to other zoological gardens that he had seen in London,
    and on the <i>aw</i>-continong and in the-<i>aw</i>-er-<i>aw</i>&mdash;the
    States, dontcherknow. The fellows reckoned that he ought to be &ldquo;took
    down a peg&rdquo;  (dontcherknow) and the sandy-complexioned comedian said
    he&rsquo;d do it. So he stepped softly up to the swell, tapped him lightly
    on the shoulder, and pointed aft&mdash;holding his arm out like a pump handle
    and his forefinger rigid.</p>
  <p>The Britisher&rsquo;s face was a study; it was blank at first and then it
    went all colours, and wore, in succession, every possible expression except
    a pleasant one. He seemed bursting with indignation, but he did not speak&mdash;could
    not, perhaps; and, as soon as he could detach his feet from the spot to which
    they had been nailed in the first place by astonishment, he stalked aft.
    He did not come to see the zoo any more.</p>
  <p>The fellows in the fore-cabin that evening were growling about the bad quality
    of the grub supplied.</p>
  <p>Then the shearer&rsquo;s volcano showed signs of activity. He shifted round,
    spat impatiently, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You chaps don&rsquo;t know what yer talkin&rsquo; about. You want
    something to grumble about. You should have been out with me last year on
    the Paroo in Noo South Wales. The meat we got there was so bad that it uster
    travel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! travel! take the track! go on the wallaby! The cockies over
    there used to hang the meat up on the branches of the trees, and just shake
    it whenever they wanted to feed the fowls. And the water was so bad that
    half a pound of tea in the billy wouldn&rsquo;t make no impression on the
    colour&mdash;nor the taste. The further west we went the worse our meat got,
    till at last we had to carry a dog-chain to chain it up at night. Then it
    got worse and broke the chain, and then we had to train the blessed dogs
    to shepherd it and bring it back. But we fell in with another chap with a
    bad old dog&mdash;a downright knowing, thieving, old hard-case of a dog;
    and this dog led our dogs astray&mdash;demoralized them&mdash;corrupted
    their morals&mdash;and so one morning they came home with the blooming meat
    inside them, instead of outside&mdash;and we had to go hungry for breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better turn in, gentlemen. I&rsquo;m going to turn off
    the light,&rdquo;  said the steward.</p>
  <p>The yarn reminded the Sydney man of a dog he had, and he started some dog
    lies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This dog of mine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;knowed the way into the
    best public-houses. If I came to a strange town and wanted a good drink,
    I&rsquo;d only have to say, &lsquo;Jack, I&rsquo;m dry,&rsquo; and he&rsquo;d
    lead me all right. He always knew the side entrances and private doors after
    hours, and I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the yarn did not go very well&mdash;it fell flat in fact. Then the commercial
    traveller was taken bad with an anecdote. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I had a black bag once that knew the way into public-houses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. A black bag. A long black bag like that one I&rsquo;ve got there
    in my bunk. I was staying at a boarding-house in Sydney, and one of us used
    to go out every night for a couple of bottles of beer, and we carried the
    bottles in the bag; and when we got opposite the pub the front end of the
    bag would begin to swing round towards the door. It was wonderful. It was
    just as if there was a lump of steel in the end of the bag and a magnet in
    the bar. We tried it with ever so many people, but it always acted the same.
    We couldn&rsquo;t use that bag for any other purpose, for if we carried it
    along the street it would make our wrists ache trying to go into pubs. It
    twisted my wrist one time, and it ain&rsquo;t got right since&mdash;I always
    feel the pain in dull weather. Well, one night we got yarning and didn&rsquo;t
    notice how the time was going, and forgot to go for the beer till it was
    nearly too late. We looked for the bag and couldn&rsquo;t find it&mdash;we
    generally kept it under a side-table, but it wasn&rsquo;t there, and before
    we were done looking, eleven o&rsquo;clock went. We sat down round the fire,
    feeling pretty thirsty, and were just thinking about turning in when we heard
    a thump on the table behind us. We looked round, and there was that bag with
    two full bottles of English ale in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I remembered that I&rsquo;d left a bob in the bottom of the
    bag, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The steward turned off the electric light.</p>
  <p>There were some hundreds of cases of oranges stacked on deck, and made fast
    with matting and cordage to the bulwarks. That night was very dark, and next
    morning there was a row. The captain said he&rsquo;d &ldquo;give any man
    three months that he caught at those oranges.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot, yer givin&rsquo; us?&rdquo; said a shearer. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
    know anything about yer bloomin&rsquo; oranges.... I seen one of the saloon
    passengers moochin&rsquo; round for&rsquo;ard last night. You&rsquo;d better
    search the saloon for your blarsted oranges, an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t come round
    tacklin&rsquo; the wrong men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not necessary to search our quarters, for the &ldquo;offside&rdquo; steward
    was sweeping orange peel out of the steerage for three days thereafter.</p>
  <p>And that night, just as we were about to fall asleep, a round, good-humoured
    face loomed over the edge of the shelf above and a small, twinkling, grey
    eye winked at us. Then a hand came over, gave a jerk, and something fell
    on our nose. It was an orange. We sent a &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; up through
    the boards and commenced hurriedly and furtively to stow away the orange.
    But the comedian had an axe to grind&mdash;most people have&mdash;wanted
    to drop his peel alongside our berth; and it made us uneasy because we did
    not want circumstantial evidence lying round us if the captain chanced to
    come down to inquire. The next man to us had a barney with the man above
    him about the same thing. Then the peel was scattered round pretty fairly,
    or thrown into an empty bunk, and no man dared growl lest he should come
    to be regarded as a blackleg&mdash;a would-be informer.</p>
  <p>The men opposite the door kept a look out; and two Australian jokers sat
    in the top end berth with their legs hanging over and swinging contentedly,
    and the porthole open ready for a swift and easy disposal of circumstantial
    evidence on the first alarm. They were eating a pineapple which they had
    sliced and extracted in sections from a crate up on deck. They looked so
    chummy, and so school-boyishly happy and contented, that they reminded us
    of the days long ago, when we were so high.</p>
  <p>The chaps had talk about those oranges on deck next day. The commercial
    traveller said we had a right to the oranges, because the company didn&rsquo;t
    give us enough to eat. He said that we were already suffering from insufficient
    proper nourishment, and he&rsquo;d tell the doctor so if the doctor came
    on board at Auckland. Anyway, it was no sin to rob a company.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said our comedian, &ldquo;those oranges, perhaps,
    were sent over by a poor, struggling orange grower, with a wife and family
    to keep, and he&rsquo;ll have to bear the loss, and a few bob might make
    a lot of difference to him. It ain&rsquo;t right to rob a poor man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This made us feel doubtful and mean, and one or two got uncomfortable and
    shifted round uneasily. But presently the traveller came to the rescue. He
    said that no doubt the oranges belonged to a middleman, and the middleman
    was the curse of the country. We felt better.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the trip the women began to turn up. There were five
    grass widows, and every female of them had a baby. The Australian marries
    young and poor; and, when he can live no longer in his native land, he sells
    the furniture, buys a steerage ticket to New Zealand or Western Australia,
    and leaves his wife with her relatives or friends until he earns enough money
    to send for her. Four of our women were girl-wives, and mostly pretty. One
    little handful of a thing had a fine baby boy, nearly as big as herself,
    and she looked so fragile and pale, and pretty and lonely, and had such an
    appealing light in her big shadowed brown eyes, and such a pathetic droop
    at the corners of her sweet little mouth, that you longed to take her in
    your manly arms&mdash;baby and all&mdash;and comfort her.</p>
  <p>The last afternoon on high seas was spent in looking through glasses for
    the Pinnacles, off North Cape. And, as we neared the land, the commercial
    traveller remarked that he wouldn&rsquo;t mind if there was a wreck now&mdash;provided
    we all got saved.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;d have all our names in the papers,&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;Gallant conduct of the passengers and crew. Heroic rescue by
    Mr So-and-so-climbing the cliffs with a girl under his arm, and all that
    sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps smiled a doleful smile, and turned away again to look at the Promised
    Land. They had had no anxiety to speak of for the last two or three days;
    but now they were again face to face with the cursed question, &ldquo;How
    to make a living.&rdquo; They were wondering whether or no they would get
    work in New Zealand, and feeling more doubtful about it than when they embarked.</p>
  <p>Pity we couldn&rsquo;t go to sea and sail away for ever, and never see land
    any more&mdash;or, at least, not till better and brighter days&mdash;if they
    ever come.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryOfMalachi"></a>The Story Of Malachi</b></h2>
  <p>Malachi was very tall, very thin, and very round-shouldered, and the sandiness
    of his hair also cried aloud for an adjective. All the boys considered Malachi
    the greatest ass on the station, and there was no doubt that he <i>was</i> an
    awful fool. He had never been out of his native bush in all his life, excepting
    once, when he paid a short visit to Sydney, and when he returned it was evident
    that his nerves had received a shaking. We failed to draw one word out of
    Malachi regarding his views on the city&mdash;to describe it was not in his
    power, for it had evidently been something far beyond his comprehension.
    Even after his visit had become a matter of history, if you were to ask him
    what he thought of Sydney the dazed expression would come back into his face,
    and he would scratch his head and say in a slow and deliberate manner, &ldquo;Well,
    there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;  And as such the city
    remained, so far as Malachi&rsquo;s opinion of it was concerned.</p>
  <p>Malachi was always shabbily dressed, in spite of his pound a week and board,
    and &ldquo;When Malachi gets a new suit of clothes&rdquo; was the expression
    invariably used by the boys to fix a date for some altogether improbable
    event. We were always having larks with Malachi, for we looked upon him as
    our legitimate butt. He seldom complained, and when he did his remonstrance
    hardly ever went beyond repeating the words, &ldquo;Now, none of your pranktical
    jokes!&rdquo; If this had not the desired effect, and we put up some too
    outrageous trick on him, he would content himself by muttering with sorrowful
    conviction, &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no mistake, it&rsquo;s a caution.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We were not content with common jokes, such as sewing up the legs of Malachi&rsquo;s
    trousers while he slept, fixing his bunk, or putting explosives in his pipe&mdash;we
    aspired to some of the higher branches of the practical joker&rsquo;s art.
    It was well known that Malachi had an undying hatred for words of four syllables
    and over, and the use of them was always sufficient to forfeit any good opinions
    he might have previously entertained concerning the user. &ldquo;I hate them
    high-flown words,&rdquo;  he would say&mdash;&ldquo;I got a book at home
    that I could get them out of if I wanted them; but I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The
    book referred to was a very dilapidated dictionary. Malachi&rsquo;s hatred
    for high-flown words was only equalled by his aversion to the opposite sex;
    and, this being known, we used to write letters to him in a feminine hand,
    threatening divers breach of promise actions, and composed in the high-flown
    language above alluded to. We used to think this very funny, and by these
    means we made his life a burden to him. Malachi put the most implicit faith
    in everything we told him; he would take in the most improbable yarn provided
    we preserved a grave demeanour and used no high-flown expressions. He would
    indeed sometimes remark that our yarns were a caution, but that was all.</p>
  <p>We played upon him the most gigantic joke of all during the visit of a certain
    bricklayer, who came to do some work at the homestead. &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo; was
    a bit of a phrenologist, and knew enough of physiognomy and human nature
    to give a pretty fair delineation of character. He also went in for spirit-rapping,
    greatly to the disgust of the two ancient housekeepers, who declared that
    they&rsquo;d have &ldquo;no dalins wid him and his divil&rsquo;s worruk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The bricklayer was from the first an object of awe to Malachi, who carefully
    avoided him; but one night we got the butt into a room where the artisan
    was entertaining the boys with a seance. After the table-rapping, during
    which Malachi sat with uncovered head and awe-struck expression, we proposed
    that he should have his bumps read, and before he could make his escape Malachi
    was seated in a chair in the middle of the room and the bricklayer was running
    his fingers over his head. I really believe that Malachi&rsquo;s hair bristled
    between the phrenologist&rsquo;s fingers. Whenever he made a hit his staunch
    admirer, &ldquo;Donegal,&rdquo; would exclaim &ldquo;Look at that now!&rdquo; while
    the girls tittered and said, &ldquo;Just fancy!&rdquo; and from time to time
    Malachi would be heard to mutter to himself, in a tone of the most intense
    conviction, that,  &ldquo;without the least mistake it was a caution.&rdquo; Several
    times at his work the next day Malachi was observed to rest on his spade,
    while he tilted his hat forward with one hand and felt the back of his head
    as though he had not been previously aware of its existence.</p>
  <p>We &ldquo;ran&rdquo; Malachi to believe that the bricklayer was mad on the
    subject of phrenology, and was suspected of having killed several persons
    in order to obtain their skulls for experimental purposes. We further said
    that he had been heard to say that Malachi&rsquo;s skull was a most extraordinary
    one, and so we advised him to be careful.</p>
  <p>Malachi occupied a hut some distance from the station, and one night, the
    last night of the bricklayer&rsquo;s stay, as Malachi sat smoking over the
    fire the door opened quietly and the phrenologist entered. He carried a bag
    with a pumpkin in the bottom of it, and, sitting down on a stool, he let
    the bag down with a bump on the floor between his feet. Malachi was badly
    scared, but he managed to stammer out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello!&rdquo; said the phrenologist.</p>
  <p>There was an embarrassing silence, which was at last broken by &ldquo;Bricky&rdquo;  saying &ldquo;How
    are you gettin&rsquo; on, Malachi?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, jist right,&rdquo; replied Malachi.</p>
  <p>Nothing was said for a while, until Malachi, after fidgeting a good deal
    on his stool, asked the bricklayer when he was leaving the station.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m going away in the morning, early,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    jist been over to Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s camp, and as I was passing I thought
    I&rsquo;d call and get your head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I come for your skull.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the phrenologist continued, while Malachi sat horror-stricken;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s skull here,&rdquo; and he lifted the bag and lovingly
    felt the pumpkin&mdash;it must have weighed forty pounds. &ldquo;I spoilt
    one of his best bumps with the tomahawk. I had to hit him twice, but it&rsquo;s
    no use crying over spilt milk.&rdquo; Here he drew a heavy shingling-hammer
    out of the bag and wiped off with his sleeve something that looked like blood.
    Malachi had been edging round for the door, and now he made a rush for it.
    But the skull-fancier was there before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gor-sake you don&rsquo;t want to murder me!&rdquo; gasped Malachi.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I can get your skull any other way,&rdquo; said Bricky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; gasped Malachi&mdash;and then, with a vague idea that
    it was best to humour a lunatic, he continued, in a tone meant to be off-hand
    and careless&mdash;&ldquo;Now, look here, if yer only waits till I die you
    can have my whole skelington and welcome.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now Malachi,&rdquo; said the phrenologist sternly, &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye
    think I&rsquo;m a fool? I ain&rsquo;t going to stand any humbug. If yer acts
    sensible you&rsquo;ll be quiet, and it&rsquo;ll soon be over, but if yer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Malachi did not wait to hear the rest. He made a spring for the back of
    the hut and through it, taking down a large new sheet of stringy-bark in
    his flight. Then he could be heard loudly ejaculating &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
    caution!&rdquo; as he went through the bush like a startled kangaroo, and
    he didn&rsquo;t stop till he reached the station.</p>
  <p>Jimmy Nowlett and I had been peeping through a crack in the same sheet of
    bark that Malachi dislodged; it fell on us and bruised us somewhat, but it
    wasn&rsquo;t enough to knock the fun out of the thing.</p>
  <p>When Jimmy Nowlett crawled out from under the bark he had to lie down on
    Malachi&rsquo;s bunk to laugh, and even for some time afterwards it was not
    unusual for Jimmy to wake up in the night and laugh till we wished
    him dead.</p>
  <p>I should like to finish here, but there remains something more to be said
    about Malachi.</p>
  <p>One of the best cows at the homestead had a calf, about which she made a
    great deal of fuss. She was ordinarily a quiet, docile creature, and, though
    somewhat fussy after calving no one ever dreamed that she would injure anyone.
    It happened one day that the squatter&rsquo;s daughter and her intended husband,
    a Sydney exquisite, were strolling in a paddock where the cow was. Whether
    the cow objected to the masher or his lady love&rsquo;s red parasol, or whether
    she suspected designs upon her progeny, is not certain; anyhow, she went
    for them. The young man saw the cow coming first, and he gallantly struck
    a bee-line for the fence, leaving the girl to manage for herself. She wouldn&rsquo;t
    have managed very well if Malachi hadn&rsquo;t been passing just then. He
    saw the girl&rsquo;s danger and ran to intercept the cow with no weapon but
    his hands.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t last long. There was a roar, a rush, and a cloud of dust,
    out of which the cow presently emerged, and went scampering back to the bush
    in which her calf was hidden.</p>
  <p>We carried Malachi home and laid him on a bed. He had a terrible wound in
    the groin, and the blood soaked through the bandages like water. We did all
    that was possible for him, the boys killed the squatter&rsquo;s best horse
    and spoilt two others riding for a doctor, but it was of no use. In the last
    half-hour of his life we all gathered round Malachi&rsquo;s bed; he was only
    twenty-two. Once he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder how mother&rsquo;ll manage now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your mother?&rdquo; someone asked gently; we had
    never dreamt that Malachi might have someone to love him and be proud of
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In Bathurst,&rdquo; he answered wearily&mdash;&ldquo;she&rsquo;ll
    take on awful, I &rsquo;spect, she was awful fond of me&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
    been pulling together this last ten years&mdash;mother and me&mdash;we wanted
    to make it all right for my little brother Jim&mdash;poor Jim!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with Jim?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s blind,&rdquo; said Malachi &ldquo;always was&mdash;we
    wanted to make it all right for him agin time he grows up&mdash;I&mdash;I
    managed to send home about&mdash;about forty pounds a year&mdash;we bought
    a bit of ground, and&mdash;and&mdash;I think&mdash;I&rsquo;m going now. Tell &rsquo;em,
    Harry&mdash;tell  &rsquo;em how it was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had to go outside then. I couldn&rsquo;t stand it any more. There was
    a lump in my throat and I&rsquo;d have given anything to wipe out my share
    in the practical jokes, but it was too late now.</p>
  <p>Malachi was dead when I went in again, and that night the hat went round
    with the squatter&rsquo;s cheque in the bottom of it and we made it &ldquo;all
    right&rdquo;  for Malachi&rsquo;s blind brother Jim.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoDogsAndAFence"></a>Two Dogs And A Fence</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing makes a dog madder,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;than to
    have another dog come outside his fence and sniff and bark at him through
    the cracks when he can&rsquo;t get out. The other dog might be an entire
    stranger; he might be an old chum, and he mightn&rsquo;t bark&mdash;only
    sniff&mdash;but it makes no difference to the inside dog. The inside dog
    generally starts it, and the outside dog only loses his temper and gets wild
    because the inside dog has lost his and got mad and made such a stinking
    fuss about nothing at all; and then the outside dog barks back and makes
    matters a thousand times worse, and the inside dog foams at the mouth and
    dashes the foam about, and goes at it like a million steel traps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell why the inside dog gets so wild about it in the
    first place, except, perhaps, because he thinks the outside dog has taken
    him at a disadvantage and is &lsquo;poking it at him;&rsquo; anyway, he gets
    madder the longer it lasts, and at last he gets savage enough to snap off
    his own tail and tear it to bits, because he can&rsquo;t get out and chew
    up that other dog; and, if he did get out, he&rsquo;d kill the other dog,
    or try to, even if it was his own brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the outside dog only smiles and trots off; sometimes he
    barks back good-humouredly; sometimes he only just gives a couple of disinterested
    barks as if he isn&rsquo;t particular, but is expected, because of his dignity
    and doghood, to say something under the circumstances; and sometimes, if
    the outside dog is a little dog, he&rsquo;ll get away from that fence in
    a hurry on the first surprise, or, if he&rsquo;s a cheeky little dog, he&rsquo;ll
    first make sure that the inside dog can&rsquo;t get out, and then he&rsquo;ll
    have some fun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s amusing to see a big dog, of the Newfoundland kind, sniffing
    along outside a fence with a broad, good-natured grin on his face all the
    time the inside dog is whooping away at the rate of thirty whoops a second,
    and choking himself, and covering himself with foam, and dashing the spray
    through the cracks, and jolting and jerking every joint in his body up to
    the last joint in his tail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes the inside dog is a little dog, and the smaller he is the
    more row he makes&mdash;but then he knows he&rsquo;s safe. And, sometimes,
    as I said before, the outside dog is a short-tempered dog who hates a row,
    and never wants to have a disagreement with anybody&mdash;like a good many
    peaceful men, who hate rows, and are always nice and civil and pleasant,
    in a nasty, unpleasant, surly, sneering sort of civil way that makes you
    want to knock their heads off; men who never start a row, but keep it going,
    and make it a thousand times worse when it&rsquo;s once started, just because
    they didn&rsquo;t start it&mdash;and keep on saying so, and that the other
    party did. The short-tempered outside dog gets wild at the other dog for
    losing his temper, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What are you making such a fuss about? What&rsquo;s the matter
    with you, anyway? Hey?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the inside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Who do you think you&rsquo;re talking to? You&mdash;! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; etc.,
    etc., etc.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then the outside dog says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re worse than a flaming old slut!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then they go at it, and you can hear them miles off, like a Chinese
    war&mdash;like a hundred great guns firing eighty blank cartridges a minute,
    till the outside dog is just as wild to get inside and eat the inside dog
    as the inside dog is to get out and disembowel him. Yet if those same two
    dogs were to meet casually outside they might get chummy at once, and be
    the best of friends, and swear everlasting mateship, and take each other
    home.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="JonessAlley"></a>Jones&rsquo;s Alley</b></h2>
  <p>She lived in Jones&rsquo;s Alley. She cleaned offices, washed, and nursed
    from daylight until any time after dark, and filled in her spare time cleaning
    her own place (which she always found dirty&mdash;in a &ldquo;beastly filthy
    state,&rdquo; she called it&mdash;on account of the children being left in
    possession all day), cooking, and nursing her own sick&mdash;for her family,
    though small, was so in the two senses of the word, and sickly; one or another
    of the children was always sick, but not through her fault. She did her own,
    or rather the family washing, at home too, when she couldn&rsquo;t do it
    by kind permission, or surreptitiously in connection with that of her employers.
    She was a haggard woman. Her second husband was supposed to be dead, and
    she, lived in dread of his daily resurrection. Her eldest son was at large,
    but, not being yet sufficiently hardened in misery, she dreaded his getting
    into trouble even more than his frequent and interested appearances at home.
    She could buy off the son for a shilling or two and a clean shirt and collar,
    but she couldn&rsquo;t purchase the absence of the father at any price&mdash;<i>he</i> claimed
    what he called his &ldquo;conzugal rights&rdquo; as well as his board, lodging,
    washing and beer. She slaved for her children, and nag-nag-nagged them everlastingly,
    whether they were in the right or in the wrong, but they were hardened to
    it and took small notice. She had the spirit of a bullock. Her whole nature
    was soured. She had those &ldquo;worse troubles&rdquo; which she couldn&rsquo;t
    tell to anybody, but had to suffer in silence.</p>
  <p>She also, in what she called her &ldquo;spare time,&rdquo; put new cuffs
    and collar-bands on gentlemen&rsquo;s shirts. The gentlemen didn&rsquo;t
    live in Jones&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;they boarded with a patroness of the haggard
    woman; they didn&rsquo;t know their shirts were done there&mdash;had they
    known it, and known Jones&rsquo;s Alley, one or two of them, who were medical
    students, might probably have objected. The landlady charged them just twice
    as much for repairing their shirts as she paid the haggard woman, who, therefore,
    being unable to buy the cuffs and collar-bands ready-made for sewing on,
    had no lack of employment with which to fill in her spare time.</p>
  <p>Therefore, she was a &ldquo;respectable woman,&rdquo; and was known in Jones&rsquo;s
    Alley as &ldquo;Misses&rdquo; Aspinall, and called so generally, and even
    by Mother Brock, who kept &ldquo;that place&rdquo; opposite. There is implied
    a world of difference between the &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;  and the &ldquo;Misses,&rdquo; as
    applied to matrons in Jones&rsquo;s Alley; and this distinction was about
    the only thing&mdash;always excepting the everlasting &ldquo;children&rdquo;&mdash;that
    the haggard woman had left to care about, to take a selfish, narrow-minded
    sort of pleasure in&mdash;if, indeed, she could yet take pleasure, grim or
    otherwise, in anything except, perhaps, a good cup of tea and time to drink
    it in.</p>
  <p>Times were hard with Mrs Aspinall. Two coppers and two half-pence in her
    purse were threepence to her now, and the absence of one of the half-pence
    made a difference to her, especially in Paddy&rsquo;s market&mdash;that eloquent
    advertisement of a young city&rsquo;s sin and poverty and rotten wealth&mdash;on
    Saturday night. She counted the coppers as anxiously and nervously as a thirsty
    dead-beat does. And her house was &ldquo;falling down on her&rdquo; and her
    troubles, and she couldn&rsquo;t get the landlord to do a &ldquo;han&rsquo;stern&rdquo; to
    it.</p>
  <p>At last, after persistent agitation on her part (but not before a portion
    of the plastered ceiling had fallen and severely injured one of her children)
    the landlord caused two men to be sent to &ldquo;effect necessary repairs&rdquo; to
    the three square, dingy, plastered holes&mdash;called &ldquo;three rooms
    and a kitchen&rdquo;&mdash;for the privilege of living in which, and calling
    it &ldquo;my place,&rdquo; she paid ten shillings a week.</p>
  <p>Previously the agent, as soon as he had received the rent and signed the
    receipt, would cut short her reiterated complaints&mdash;which he privately
    called her &ldquo;clack&rdquo;&mdash;by saying that he&rsquo;d see to it,
    he&rsquo;d speak to the landlord; and, later on, that he <i>had</i> spoken
    to him, or could do nothing more in the matter&mdash;that it wasn&rsquo;t
    his business. Neither it was, to do the agent justice. It was his business
    to collect the rent, and thereby earn the means of paying his own. He had
    to keep a family on his own account, by assisting the Fat Man to keep his
    at the expense of people&mdash;especially widows with large families, or
    women, in the case of Jones&rsquo;s Alley&mdash;who couldn&rsquo;t afford
    it without being half-starved, or running greater and unspeakable risks which &ldquo;society&rdquo; is
    not supposed to know anything about.</p>
  <p>So the agent was right, according to his lights. The landlord had recently
    turned out a family who had occupied one of his houses for fifteen years,
    because they were six weeks in arrears. He let them take their furniture,
    and explained:  &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have been so lenient with them only
    they were such old tenants of mine.&rdquo;  So the landlord was always in
    the right according to <i>his</i> lights.</p>
  <p>But the agent naturally wished to earn his living as peacefully and as comfortably
    as possible, so, when the accident occurred, he put the matter so persistently
    and strongly before the landlord that he said at last: &ldquo;Well, tell
    her to go to White, the contractor, and he&rsquo;ll send a man to do what&rsquo;s
    to be done; and don&rsquo;t bother me any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>White had a look at the place, and sent a plasterer, a carpenter, and a
    plumber. The plasterer knocked a bigger hole in the ceiling and filled it
    with mud; the carpenter nailed a board over the hole in the floor; the plumber
    stopped the leak in the kitchen, and made three new ones in worse places;
    and their boss sent the bill to Mrs Aspinall.</p>
  <p>She went to the contractor&rsquo;s yard, and explained that the landlord
    was responsible for the debt, not she. The contractor explained that he had
    seen the landlord, who referred him to her. She called at the landlord&rsquo;s
    private house, and was referred through a servant to the agent. The agent
    was sympathetic, but could do nothing in the matter&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t
    his business; he also asked her to put herself in his place, which she couldn&rsquo;t,
    not being any more reasonable than such women are in such cases. She let
    things drift, being powerless to prevent them from doing so; and the contractor
    sent another bill, then a debt collector and then another bill, then the
    collector again, and threatened to take proceedings, and finally took them.
    To make matters worse, she was two weeks in arrears with the rent, and the
    wood-and-coalman&rsquo;s man (she had dealt with them for ten years) was
    pushing her, as also were her grocers, with whom she had dealt for fifteen
    years and never owed a penny before.</p>
  <p>She waylaid the landlord, and he told her shortly that he couldn&rsquo;t
    build houses and give them away, and keep them in repair afterwards.</p>
  <p>She sought for sympathy and found it, but mostly in the wrong places. It
    was comforting, but unprofitable. Mrs Next-door sympathized warmly, and offered
    to go up as a witness&mdash;she had another landlord. The agent sympathized
    wearily, but not in the presence of witnesses&mdash;he wanted her to put
    herself in his place. Mother Brock, indeed, offered practical assistance,
    which offer was received in breathlessly indignant silence. It was Mother
    Brock who first came to the assistance of Mrs Aspinall&rsquo;s child when
    the plaster accident took place (the mother being absent at the time), and
    when Mrs Aspinall heard of it, her indignation cured her of her fright, and
    she declared to Mrs Next-door that she would give &ldquo;that woman&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
    Mother Brock&mdash;&ldquo;in char-rge the instant she ever <i>dared</i> to
    put her foot inside her (Mrs A.&rsquo;s) respectable door-step again. She
    was a respectable, honest, hard-working woman, and&mdash;&rdquo; etc.</p>
  <p>Whereat Mother Brock laughed good-naturedly. She was a broad-minded bad
    woman, and was right according to <i>her</i> lights. Poor Mrs A. was a respectable,
    haggard woman, and was right according to <i>her</i> lights, and to Mrs Next-door&rsquo;s,
    perfectly so&mdash;they being friends&mdash;and <i>vice versa</i>. None of
    them knew, or would have taken into consideration, the fact that the landlord
    had lost all his money in a burst financial institution, and half his houses
    in the general depression, and depended for food for his family on the somewhat
    doubtful rents of the remainder. So they were all right according to their
    different lights.</p>
  <p>Mrs Aspinall even sought sympathy of &ldquo;John,&rdquo; the Chinaman (with
    whom she had dealt for four months only), and got it. He also, in all simplicity,
    took a hint that wasn&rsquo;t intended. He said: &ldquo;Al li&rsquo;. Pay
    bimeby. Nexy time Flyday. Me tlust.&rdquo; Then he departed with his immortalized
    smile. It would almost appear that he was wrong&mdash;according to our idea
    of Chinese lights.</p>
  <p>Mrs Aspinall went to the court&mdash;it was a small local court. Mrs Next-door
    was awfully sorry, but she couldn&rsquo;t possibly get out that morning.
    The contractor had the landlord up as a witness. The landlord and the P.M.
    nodded pleasantly to each other, and wished each other good morning.... Verdict
    for plaintiff with costs... Next case!... &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take up
    the time of the court, my good woman.&rdquo;.. &ldquo;Now, constable!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Arder
    in the court!&rdquo;... &ldquo;Now, my good woman,&rdquo; said the policeman
    in an undertone, &ldquo;you must go out; there&rsquo;s another case on-come
    now.&rdquo; And he steered her&mdash;but not unkindly&mdash;through the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My good woman&rdquo; stood in the crowd outside, and looked wildly
    round for a sympathetic face that advertised sympathetic ears. But others
    had their own troubles, and avoided her. She wanted someone to relieve her
    bursting heart to; she couldn&rsquo;t wait till she got home.</p>
  <p>Even &ldquo;John&rsquo;s&rdquo; attentive ear and mildly idiotic expression
    would have been welcome, but he was gone. He <i>had</i> been in court that
    morning, and had won a small debt case, and had departed cheerfully, under
    the impression that he lost it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;aw Mrs Aspinall, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She started, and looked round. He was one of those sharp, blue or grey-eyed,
    sandy or freckled complexioned boys-of-the-world whom we meet everywhere
    and at all times, who are always going on towards twenty, yet never seem
    to get clear out of their teens, who know more than most of us have forgotten,
    who understand human nature instinctively&mdash;perhaps unconsciously&mdash;and
    are instinctively sympathetic and diplomatic; whose satire is quick, keen,
    and dangerous, and whose tact is often superior to that of many educated
    men-of-the-world. Trained from childhood in the great school of poverty,
    they are full of the pathos and humour of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; can&rsquo;t say I do. I fancy I&rsquo;ve seen your face before
    somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was at your place when little Arvie died. I used to work with him
    at Grinder Brothers&rsquo;, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, of course I remember you! What was I thinking about? I&rsquo;ve
    had such a lot of worry lately that I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m
    on my head or my heels. Besides, you&rsquo;ve grown since then, and changed
    a lot. You&rsquo;re Billy&mdash;Billy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Billy Anderson&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course! To be sure! I remember you quite well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;ve you been gettin&rsquo; on, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Don&rsquo;t mention it&mdash;nothing but worry and trouble&mdash;nothing
    but worry and trouble. This grinding poverty! I&rsquo;ll never have anything
    else but worry and trouble and misery so long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you live in Jones&rsquo;s Alley yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not bin there ever since, have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I shifted away once, but I went back again. I was away nearly
    two years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so, because I called to see you there once. Well, I&rsquo;m
    goin&rsquo;  that way now. You goin&rsquo; home, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll go along with you, if you don&rsquo;t mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I&rsquo;d be only too glad of company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to walk, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo; asked Bill, as the tram
    stopped in their way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I can&rsquo;t afford trams now&mdash;times are too hard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry I don&rsquo;t happen to have no tickets on me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t mention it. I&rsquo;m well used to walking. I&rsquo;d
    rather walk than ride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They waited till the tram passed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some people&rdquo;&mdash;said Bill, reflectively, but with a tinge
    of indignation in his tone, as they crossed the street&mdash;&ldquo;some
    people can afford to ride in trams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your trouble, Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a fair
    thing to ask?&rdquo; said Bill, as they turned the corner.</p>
  <p>This was all she wanted, and more; and when, about a mile later, she paused
    for breath, he drew a long one, gave a short whistle, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s red-hot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus encouraged, she told her story again, and some parts of it for the
    third and fourth and even fifth time&mdash;and it grew longer, as our stories
    have a painful tendency to do when we re-write them with a view to condensation.</p>
  <p>But Bill heroically repeated that it was &ldquo;red-hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I dealt off the grocer for fifteen years, and the wood-and-coal
    man for ten, and I lived in that house nine years last Easter Monday and
    never owed a penny before,&rdquo; she repeated for the tenth time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a mistake,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;I never
    dealt off nobody more&rsquo;n twice in my life.... I heerd you was married
    again, Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a right thing to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wherever did you hear that? I did get married again&mdash;to my sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you ain&rsquo;t Mrs Aspinall&mdash;if it&rsquo;s a fair thing
    to ask?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! I&rsquo;m known as Mrs Aspinall. They all call me Mrs Aspinall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand. He cleared, didn&rsquo;t he? Run away?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes&mdash;no&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I understand. He&rsquo;s s&rsquo;posed to be dead?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s red-hot! So&rsquo;s my old man, and I hope he
    don&rsquo;t resurrect again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see, I married my second for the sake of my children.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great mistake,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;My mother
    married my step-father for the sake of me, and she&rsquo;s never been done
    telling me about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed! Did <i>your</i> mother get married again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. And he left me with a batch of step-sisters and step-brothers
    to look after, as well as mother; as if things wasn&rsquo;t bad enough before.
    We didn&rsquo;t want no help to be pinched, and poor, and half-starved. I
    don&rsquo;t see where my sake comes in at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how&rsquo;s your mother now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right, thank you. She&rsquo;s got a hard time
    of it, but she&rsquo;s pretty well used to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And are you still working at Grinder Brothers&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. I got tired of slavin&rsquo; there for next to nothing. I got
    sick of my step-father waitin&rsquo; outside for me on pay-day, with a dirty,
    drunken, spieler pal of his waitin&rsquo; round the corner for him. There
    wasn&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; in it. It got to be too rough altogether.... Blast
    Grinders!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what are you doing now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sellin&rsquo; papers. I&rsquo;m always tryin&rsquo; to get a start
    in somethin&rsquo; else, but I ain&rsquo;t got no luck. I always come back
    to, sellin&rsquo; papers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, after a thought, he added reflectively: &ldquo;Blast papers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His present ambition was to drive a cart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I drove a cart twice, and once I rode a butcher&rsquo;s horse. A
    bloke worked me out of one billet, and I worked myself out of the other.
    I didn&rsquo;t know when I was well off. Then the banks went bust, and my
    last boss went insolvent, and one of his partners went into Darlinghurst
    for suicide, and the other went into Gladesville for being mad; and one day
    the bailiff seized the cart and horse with me in it and a load of timber.
    So I went home and helped mother and the kids to live on one meal a day for
    six months, and keep the bum-bailiff out. Another cove had my news-stand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, after a thought &ldquo;Blast reconstriction!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you surely can&rsquo;t make a living selling newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; in it. There&rsquo;s too many at
    it. The blessed women spoil it. There&rsquo;s one got a good stand down in
    George Street, and she&rsquo;s got a dozen kids sellin&rsquo;&mdash;they
    can&rsquo;t be all hers&mdash;and then she&rsquo;s got the hide to come up
    to my stand and sell in front of me.... What are you thinkin&rsquo; about
    doin&rsquo;,
    Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she wailed. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t
    know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there still being some distance to go, she plunged into her tale of
    misery once more, not forgetting the length of time she had dealt with her
    creditors.</p>
  <p>Bill pushed his hat forward and walked along on the edge of the kerb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you shift? Ain&rsquo;t you got no people or friends that
    you can go to for a while?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; there&rsquo;s my sister-in-law; she&rsquo;s asked me times
    without number to come and stay with her till things got better, and she&rsquo;s
    got a hard enough struggle herself, Lord knows. She asked me again only yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, that ain&rsquo;t too bad,&rdquo; reflected Bill. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you go?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you see, if I did they wouldn&rsquo;t let me take my furniture,
    and she&rsquo;s got next to none.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t the landlord let you take your furniture?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not him! He&rsquo;s one of the hardest landlords in Sydney&mdash;the
    worst I ever had.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s red-hot!... I&rsquo;d take it in spite of him. He can&rsquo;t
    do nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I daren&rsquo;t; and even if I did I haven&rsquo;t got a penny
    to pay for a van.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They neared the alley. Bill counted the flagstones, stepping from one to
    another over the joints. &ldquo;Eighteen-nineteen-twenty-twenty-one!&rdquo; he
    counted mentally, and came to the corner kerbing. Then he turned suddenly
    and faced her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what to do,&rdquo; he said decidedly. &ldquo;Can
    you get your things ready by to-night? I know a cove that&rsquo;s got a cart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I daren&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m afraid of the landlord.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The more fool you,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not afraid
    of him. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not afraid of a landlady,
    and that&rsquo;s worse. I know the law. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;.
    You just do as I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d want to think over it first, and see my sister-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where does your sister-&rsquo;n-law live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, see her, and think over it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got plenty of
    time to do it in&mdash;and get your things ready by dark. Don&rsquo;t be
    frightened. I&rsquo;ve shifted mother and an aunt and two married sisters
    out of worse fixes than yours. I&rsquo;ll be round after dark, and bring
    a push to lend a hand. They&rsquo;re decent coves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t expect your friend to shift me for nothing. I told
    you I haven&rsquo;t got a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs Aspinall, I ain&rsquo;t that sort of a bloke, neither is my chum,
    and neither is the other fellows&mdash;&rsquo;relse they wouldn&rsquo;t be
    friends of mine. Will you promise, Mrs Aspinall?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid&mdash;I&mdash;I&rsquo;d like to keep my few things
    now. I&rsquo;ve kept them so long. It&rsquo;s hard to lose my few bits of
    things&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t care so much if I could keep the ironin&rsquo; table.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you could, by law&mdash;it&rsquo;s necessary to your living, but
    it would cost more&rsquo;n the table. Now, don&rsquo;t be soft, Mrs Aspinall.
    You&rsquo;ll have the bailiff in any day, and be turned out in the end without
    a rag. The law knows no &lsquo;necessary.&rsquo; You want your furniture
    more&rsquo;n the landlord does. He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;. You can
    trust it all to me.... I knowed Arvie.... Will you do it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At about eight o&rsquo;clock that evening there came a mysterious knock
    at Mrs Aspinall&rsquo;s door. She opened, and there stood Bill. His attitude
    was business-like, and his manner very impressive. Three other boys stood
    along by the window, with their backs to the wall, deeply interested in the
    emptying of burnt cigarette-ends into a piece of newspaper laid in the crown
    of one of their hats, and a fourth stood a little way along the kerb casually
    rolling a cigarette, and keeping a quiet eye out for suspicious appearances.
    They were of different makes and sizes, but there seemed an undefined similarity
    between them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is my push, Mrs Aspinall,&rdquo; said Bill; &ldquo;at least,&rdquo; he
    added apologetically,  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s part of &rsquo;em. Here, you chaps,
    this is Mrs Aspinall, what I told you about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They elbowed the wall back, rubbed their heads with their hats, shuffled
    round, and seemed to take a vacant sort of interest in abstract objects,
    such as the pavement, the gas-lamp, and neighbouring doors and windows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got the things ready?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Got &rsquo;em downstairs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no upstairs. The rooms above belong to the next house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And a nice house it is,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;for rooms to belong
    to. I wonder,&rdquo;  he reflected, cocking his eye at the windows above; &ldquo;I
    wonder how the police manage to keep an eye on the next house without keepin&rsquo; an
    eye on yours&mdash;but they know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned towards the street end of the alley and gave a low whistle. Out
    under the lamp from behind the corner came a long, thin, shambling, hump-backed
    youth, with his hat down over his head like an extinguisher, dragging a small
    bony horse, which, in its turn, dragged a rickety cart of the tray variety,
    such as is used in the dead marine trade. Behind the cart was tied a mangy
    retriever. This affair was drawn up opposite the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cove with a cart&rdquo; was introduced as &lsquo;Chinny&rsquo;.
    He had no chin whatever, not even a receding chin. It seemed as though his
    chin had been cut clean off horizontally. When he took off his hat he showed
    to the mild surprise of strangers a pair of shrewd grey eyes and a broad
    high forehead. Chinny was in the empty bottle line.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, then, hold up that horse of yours for a minute, Chinny,&rdquo; said
    Bill briskly, &ldquo;&rsquo;relse he&rsquo;ll fall down and break the shaft
    again.&rdquo; (It had already been broken in several places and spliced with
    strips of deal, clothes-line, and wire.) &ldquo;Now, you chaps, fling yourselves
    about and get the furniture out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was a great relief to the push. They ran against each other and the
    door-post in their eagerness to be at work. The furniture&mdash;what Mrs
    A. called her &ldquo;few bits of things&rdquo;&mdash;was carried out with
    elaborate care. The ironing table was the main item. It was placed top down
    in the cart, and the rest of the things went between the legs without bulging
    sufficiently to cause Chinny any anxiety.</p>
  <p>Just then the picket gave a low, earnest whistle, and they were aware of
    a policeman standing statue-like under the lamp on the opposite corner, and
    apparently unaware of their existence. He was looking, sphinx-like, past
    them towards the city.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t be helped; we must put on front an&rsquo; go on with
    it now,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s all right, I think,&rdquo; said Chinny. &ldquo;He knows
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Bill; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    mind him, Mrs Aspinall. Now, then (to the push), tie up. Don&rsquo;t be frightened
    of the dorg-what are you frightened of? Why! he&rsquo;d only apologize if
    you trod on his tail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dog went under the cart, and kept his tail carefully behind him.</p>
  <p>The policeman&mdash;he was an elderly man&mdash;stood still, looking towards
    the city, and over it, perhaps, and over the sea, to long years agone in
    Ireland when he and the boys ducked bailiffs, and resisted evictions with &ldquo;shticks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;riz&rdquo;  sometimes,
    and gathered together at the rising of the moon, and did many things contrary
    to the peace of Gracious Majesty, its laws and constitutions, crown and dignity;
    as a reward for which he had helped to preserve the said peace for the best
    years of his life, without promotion; for he had a great aversion to running
    in &ldquo;the boys&rdquo;&mdash;which included nearly all mankind&mdash;and
    preferred to keep, and was most successful in keeping, the peace with no
    other assistance than that of his own rich fatherly brogue.</p>
  <p>Bill took charge of two of the children; Mrs Aspinall carried the youngest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Chinny,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>Chinny shambled forward, sideways, dragging the horse, with one long, bony,
    short-sleeved arm stretched out behind holding the rope reins; the horse
    stumbled out of the gutter, and the cart seemed to pause a moment, as if
    undecided whether to follow or not, and then, with many rickety complaints,
    moved slowly and painfully up on to the level out of the gutter. The dog
    rose with a long, weary, mangy sigh, but with a lazy sort of calculation,
    before his rope (which was short) grew taut&mdash;which was good judgment
    on his part, for his neck was sore; and his feet being tender, he felt his
    way carefully and painfully over the metal, as if he feared that at any step
    he might spring some treacherous, air-trigger trap-door which would drop
    and hang him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nit, you chaps,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;and wait for me.&rdquo; The
    push rubbed its head with its hat, said &ldquo;Good night, Mrs Ashpennel,&rdquo; and
    was absent, spook-like.</p>
  <p>When the funeral reached the street, the lonely &ldquo;trap&rdquo; was,
    somehow, two blocks away in the opposite direction, moving very slowly, and
    very upright, and very straight, like an automaton.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BoggOfGeebung"></a>Bogg Of Geebung</b></h2>
  <p>At the local police court, where the subject of this sketch turned up periodically
    amongst the drunks, he had &ldquo;James&rdquo; prefixed to his name for the
    sake of convenience and as a matter of form previous to his being fined forty
    shillings (which he never paid) and sentenced to &ldquo;a month hard&rdquo; (which
    he contrived to make as soft as possible). The local larrikins called him &ldquo;Grog,&rdquo; a
    very appropriate name, all things considered; but to the Geebung Times he
    was known until the day of his death as &ldquo;a well-known character named
    Bogg.&rdquo; The antipathy of the local paper might have been accounted for
    by the fact that Bogg strayed into the office one day in a muddled condition
    during the absence of the staff at lunch and corrected a revise proof of
    the next week&rsquo;s leader, placing bracketed &ldquo;query&rdquo; and &ldquo;see
    proof&rdquo;  marks opposite the editor&rsquo;s most flowery periods and
    quotations, and leaving on the margin some general advice to the printers
    to &ldquo;space better.&rdquo; He also corrected a Latin quotation or two,
    and added a few ideas of his own in good French.</p>
  <p>But no one, with the exception of the editor of the Times, ever dreamed
    that there was anything out of the common in the shaggy, unkempt head upon
    which poor Bogg used to &ldquo;do his little time,&rdquo; until a young English
    doctor came to practise at Geebung. One night the doctor and the manager
    of the local bank and one or two others wandered into the bar of the Diggers&rsquo; Arms,
    where Bogg sat in a dark corner mumbling to himself as usual and spilling
    half his beer on the table and floor. Presently some drunken utterances reached
    the doctor&rsquo;s ear, and he turned round in a surprised manner and looked
    at Bogg. The drunkard continued to mutter for some time, and then broke out
    into something like the fag-end of a song. The doctor walked over to the
    table at which Bogg was sitting, and, seating himself on the far corner,
    regarded the drunkard attentively for some minutes; but the latter&rsquo;s
    voice ceased, his head fell slowly on his folded arms, and all became silent
    except the drip, drip of the overturned beer falling from the table to the
    form and from the form to the floor.</p>
  <p>The doctor rose and walked back to his friends with a graver face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem interested in Bogg,&rdquo; said the bank manager.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was he mumbling about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that was a passage from Homer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor repeated his answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then do you mean to say he understands Greek?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the doctor, sadly; &ldquo;he is, or must have been,
    a classical scholar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The manager took time to digest this, and then asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was the song?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that was an old song we used to sing at the Dublin University,&rdquo;  said
    the doctor.</p>
  <p>During his sober days Bogg used to fossick about among the old mullock heaps,
    or split palings in the bush, and just managed to keep out of debt. Strange
    to say, in spite of his drunken habits, his credit was as good as that of
    any man in the town. He was very unsociable, seldom speaking, whether drunk
    or sober; but a weary, hard-up sundowner was always pretty certain to get
    a meal and a shake-down at Bogg&rsquo;s lonely hut among the mullock heaps.
    It happened one dark night that a little push of local larrikins, having
    nothing better to amuse them, wended their way through the old mullock heaps
    in the direction of the lonely little bark hut, with the object of playing
    off an elaborately planned ghost joke on Bogg. Prior to commencing operations,
    the leader of the jokers put his eye to a crack in the bark to reconnoitre.
    He didn&rsquo;t see much, but what he did see seemed to interest him, for
    he kept his eye there till his mates grew impatient. Bogg sat in front of
    his rough little table with his elbows on the same, and his hands supporting
    his forehead. Before him on the table lay a few articles such as lady novelists
    and poets use in their work, and such as bitter cynics often wear secretly
    next their bitter, cynical hearts.</p>
  <p>There was the usual faded letter, a portrait of a girl, something that looked
    like a pressed flower, and, of course, a lock of hair. Presently Bogg folded
    his arms over these things, and his face sank lower and lower, till nothing
    was visible to the unsuspected watcher except the drunkard&rsquo;s rough,
    shaggy hair; rougher and wilder looking in the uncertain light of the slush-lamp.</p>
  <p>The larrikin turned away, and beckoned his comrades to follow him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot is it?&rdquo; asked one, when they had gone some distance. The
    leader said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; ter let &rsquo;im alone; that&rsquo;s
    wot it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was some demur at this, and an explanation was demanded; but the boss
    bully unbuttoned his coat, and spat on his hands, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re a-goin&rsquo; ter let Bogg alone; that&rsquo;s wot it
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So they went away and let Bogg alone.</p>
  <p>A few days later the following paragraph appeared in the <i>Geebung Times</i>: &ldquo;A
    well-known character named Bogg was found drowned in the river on Sunday
    last, his hat and coat being found on the bank. At a late hour on Saturday
    night a member of our staff saw a man walking slowly along the river bank,
    but it was too dark to identify the person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We suppose it was Bogg whom the <i>Times</i> reported, but of course we
    cannot be sure. The chances are that it was Bogg. It was pretty evident that
    he had committed suicide, and being &ldquo;a well-known character,&rdquo; no
    doubt he had reasons for his rash act. Perhaps he was walking by himself
    in the dark along the river bank, and thinking of those reasons when the <i>Times</i> man
    saw him. Strange to say, the world knows least about the lives and sorrows
    of &ldquo;well-known characters&rdquo;  of this kind, no matter what their
    names might be, and&mdash;well, there is no reason why we should bore a reader,
    or waste any more space over a well-known character named Bogg.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SheWouldntSpeak"></a>She Wouldn&rsquo;t Speak</b></h2>
  <p>Well, we reached the pub about dinner-time, dropped our swags outside, had
    a drink, and then went into the dinin&rsquo;-room. There was a lot of jackaroo
    swells, that had been on a visit to the squatter, or something, and they
    were sittin&rsquo; down at dinner; and they seemed to think by their looks
    that we ought to have stayed outside and waited till they were done&mdash;we
    was only two rough shearers, you know. There was a very good-looking servant
    girl waitin&rsquo; on &rsquo;em, and she was all smiles&mdash;laughin&rsquo;,
    and jokin&rsquo;, and chyackin&rsquo;, and barrickin&rsquo; with &rsquo;em
    like anything.</p>
  <p>I thought a damp expression seemed to pass across her face when me and my
    mate sat down, but she served us and said nothing&mdash;we was only two dusty
    swaggies, you see. Dave said &ldquo;Good day&rdquo; to her when we came in,
    but she didn&rsquo;t answer; and I could see from the first that she&rsquo;d
    made up her mind not to speak to us.</p>
  <p>The swells finished, and got up and went out, leaving me and Dave and the
    servant girl alone in the room; but she didn&rsquo;t open her mouth&mdash;not
    once. Dave winked at her once or twice as she handed his cup, but it wasn&rsquo;t
    no go. Dave was a good-lookin&rsquo; chap, too; but we couldn&rsquo;t get
    her to say a word&mdash;not one.</p>
  <p>We finished the first blanky course, and, while she was gettin&rsquo; our
    puddin&rsquo; from the side-table, Dave says to me in a loud whisper, so&rsquo;s
    she could hear:  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she a stunner, Joe! I never thought there
    was sich fine girls on the Darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But no; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
  <p>Then Dave says: &ldquo;They pitch a blanky lot about them New Englan&rsquo; gals;
    but I&rsquo;ll back the Darlin&rsquo; girls to lick &rsquo;em holler as far&rsquo;s
    looks is concerned,&rdquo;  says Dave.</p>
  <p>But no; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak. She wouldn&rsquo;t even smile. Dave didn&rsquo;t
    say nothing for awhile, and then he said: &ldquo;Did you hear about that
    red-headed barmaid at Stiffner&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to be married to the bank
    manager at Bourke next month, Joe?&rdquo;  says Dave.</p>
  <p>But no, not a single word out of her; she didn&rsquo;t even look up, or
    look as if she wanted to speak.</p>
  <p>Dave scratched his ear and went on with his puddin&rsquo; for awhile. Then
    he said: &ldquo;Joe, did you hear that yarn about young Scotty and old whatchisname&rsquo;s
    missus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I says; &ldquo;but I think it was the daughter, not the
    wife, and young Scotty,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t no go; that girl wouldn&rsquo;t speak.</p>
  <p>Dave shut up for a good while, but presently I says to Dave &ldquo;I see
    that them hoops is comin&rsquo; in again, Dave. The paper says that this
    here Lady Duff had one on when she landed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard about it,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
    see my wife in one, but I s&rsquo;pose a woman must wear what all the rest
    does.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And do you think that girl would speak? Not a blanky word.</p>
  <p>We finished our second puddin&rsquo; and fourth cup of tea, and I was just
    gettin&rsquo; up when Dave catches holt on my arm, like that, and pulls me
    down into my chair again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old on,&rdquo; whispers Dave; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to
    make that blanky gal speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet you a five-pound note,&rdquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>So I sits down again, and Dave whistles to the girl, and he passes along
    his cup and mine. She filled &rsquo;em at once, without a word, and we got
    outside our fifth cup of tea each. Then Dave jingled his spoon, and passed
    both cups along again. She put some hot water in the pot this time, and,
    after we&rsquo;d drunk another couple of cups, Dave muttered somethin&rsquo; about
    drownin&rsquo; the miller.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We want tea, not warm water,&rdquo; he growled, lookin&rsquo; sulky
    and passin&rsquo;  along both cups again.</p>
  <p>But she never opened her mouth; she wouldn&rsquo;t speak. She didn&rsquo;t
    even, look cross. She made a fresh pot of tea, and filled our cups again.
    She didn&rsquo;t even slam the cups down, or swamp the tea over into the
    saucers&mdash;which would have been quite natural, considerin&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m about done,&rdquo; I said to Dave in a low whisper. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
    have to give it up, I&rsquo;m afraid, Dave,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her speak, or bust myself,&rdquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>And I&rsquo;m blest if he didn&rsquo;t go on till I was so blanky full of
    tea that it brimmed over and run out the corners of my mouth; and Dave was
    near as bad. At last I couldn&rsquo;t drink another teaspoonful without holding
    back my head, and then I couldn&rsquo;t keep it down, but had to let it run
    back into the blanky cup again. The girl began to clear away at the other
    end of the table, and now and then she&rsquo;d lay her hand on the teapot
    and squint round to see if we wanted any more tea. But she never spoke. She
    might have thought a lot&mdash;but she never opened her lips.</p>
  <p>I tell you, without a word of a lie, that we must have drunk about a dozen
    cups each. We made her fill the teapot twice, and kept her waitin&rsquo; nearly
    an hour, but we couldn&rsquo;t make her say a word. She never said a single
    word to us from the time we came in till the time we went out, nor before
    nor after. She&rsquo;d made up her mind from the first not to speak to us.</p>
  <p>We had to get up and leave our cups half full at last. We went out and sat
    down on our swags in the shade against the wall, and smoked and gave that
    tea time to settle, and then we got on to the track again.</p>

    with fossil fish and things and oysters that were stale when Adam was fresh
    to illustrate by. <i>&nbsp;(Remark made by Steelman, professional wanderer,
    to his pal and pupil, Smith.)</i></p>
  <p>The first man that Steelman and Smith came up to on the last embankment,
    where they struck the new railway line, was a heavy, gloomy, labouring man
    with bowyangs on and straps round his wrists. Steelman bade him the time
    of day and had a few words with him over the weather. The man of mullock
    gave it as his opinion that the fine weather wouldn&rsquo;t last, and seemed
    to take a gloomy kind of pleasure in that reflection; he said there was more
    rain down yonder, pointing to the southeast, than the moon could swallow
    up&mdash;the moon was in its first quarter, during which time it is popularly
    believed in some parts of Maoriland that the south-easter is most likely
    to be out on the wallaby and the weather bad. Steelman regarded that quarter
    of the sky with an expression of gentle remonstrance mingled as it were with
    a sort of fatherly indulgence, agreed mildly with the labouring man, and
    seemed lost for a moment in a reverie from which he roused himself to inquire
    cautiously after the boss. There was no boss, it was a co-operative party.
    That chap standing over there by the dray in the end of the cutting was their
    spokesman&mdash;their representative: they called him boss, but that was
    only his nickname in camp. Steelman expressed his thanks and moved on towards
    the cutting, followed respectfully by Smith.</p>
  <p>Steelman wore a snuff-coloured sac suit, a wide-awake hat, a pair of professional-looking
    spectacles, and a scientific expression; there was a clerical atmosphere
    about him, strengthened, however, by an air as of unconscious dignity and
    superiority, born of intellect and knowledge. He carried a black bag, which
    was an indispensable article in his profession in more senses than one. Smith
    was decently dressed in sober tweed and looked like a man of no account,
    who was mechanically devoted to his employer&rsquo;s interests, pleasures,
    or whims.</p>
  <p>The boss was a decent-looking young fellow, with a good face&mdash;rather
    solemn&mdash;and a quiet manner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, sir,&rdquo; said the boss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nice weather this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it is, but I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am afraid it will not by the look of the sky down there,&rdquo; ventured
    Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I go mostly by the look of our weather prophet,&rdquo; said the
    boss with a quiet smile, indicating the gloomy man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose bad weather would put you back in your work?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, it will; we didn&rsquo;t want any bad weather just now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman got the weather question satisfactorily settled; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be getting on with the railway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, we are about over the worst of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it?&rdquo; echoed Steelman, with mild surprise: &ldquo;I
    should have thought you were just coming into it,&rdquo; and he pointed to
    the ridge ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, our section doesn&rsquo;t go any further than that pole you see
    sticking up yonder. We had the worst of it back there across the swamps&mdash;working
    up to our waists in water most of the time, in midwinter too&mdash;and at
    eighteenpence a yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That was bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, rather rough. Did you come from the terminus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I sent my baggage on in the brake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Commercial traveller, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the boss, glancing
    at Smith, who stood a little to the rear of Steelman, seeming interested
    in the work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Steelman, smiling&mdash;&ldquo;I am&mdash;well&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    a geologist; this is my man here,&rdquo; indicating Smith. &ldquo;(You may
    put down the bag, James, and have a smoke.) My name is Stoneleigh&mdash;you
    might have heard of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said, &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; and then presently he added &ldquo;indeed,&rdquo; in
    an undecided tone.</p>
  <p>There was a pause&mdash;embarrassed on the part of the boss&mdash;he was
    silent not knowing what to say. Meanwhile Steelman studied his man and concluded
    that he would do.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Having a look at the country, I suppose?&rdquo; asked the boss presently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Steelman; then after a moment&rsquo;s reflection: &ldquo;I
    am travelling for my own amusement and improvement, and also in the interest
    of science, which amounts to the same thing. I am a member of the Royal Geological
    Society&mdash;vice-president in fact of a leading Australian branch;&rdquo; and
    then, as if conscious that he had appeared guilty of egotism, he shifted
    the subject a bit. &ldquo;Yes. Very interesting country this&mdash;very interesting
    indeed. I should like to make a stay here for a day or so. Your work opens
    right into my hands. I cannot remember seeing a geological formation which
    interested me so much. Look at the face of that cutting, for instance. Why!
    you can almost read the history of the geological world from yesterday&mdash;this
    morning as it were&mdash;beginning with the super-surface on top and going
    right down through the different layers and stratas&mdash;through the vanished
    ages&mdash;right down and back to the pre-historical&mdash;to the very primeval
    or fundamental geological formations!&rdquo; And Steelman studied the face
    of the cutting as if he could read it like a book, with every layer or stratum
    a chapter, and every streak a note of explanation. The boss seemed to be
    getting interested, and Steelman gained confidence and proceeded to identify
    and classify the different &ldquo;stratas and layers,&rdquo; and fix their
    ages, and describe the conditions and politics of man in their different
    times, for the boss&rsquo;s benefit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; continued Steelman, turning slowly from the cutting,
    removing his glasses, and letting his thoughtful eyes wander casually over
    the general scenery&mdash;&ldquo;now the first impression that this country
    would leave on an ordinary intelligent mind&mdash;though maybe unconsciously,
    would be as of a new country&mdash;new in a geological sense; with patches
    of an older geological and vegetable formation cropping out here and there;
    as for instance that clump of dead trees on that clear alluvial slope there,
    that outcrop of limestone, or that timber yonder,&rdquo; and he indicated
    a dead forest which seemed alive and green because of the parasites. &ldquo;But
    the country is old&mdash;old; perhaps the oldest geological formation in
    the world is to be seen here, the oldest vegetable formation in Australasia.
    I am not using the words old and new in an ordinary sense, you understand,
    but in a geological sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said, &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; and that geology must be a very
    interesting study.</p>
  <p>Steelman ran his eye meditatively over the cutting again, and turning to
    Smith said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go up there, James, and fetch me a specimen of that slaty outcrop
    you see there&mdash;just above the coeval strata.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a stiff climb and slippery, but Smith had to do it, and he did it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; said Steelman, breaking the rotten piece between his
    fingers,  &ldquo;belongs probably to an older geological period than its
    position would indicate&mdash;a primitive sandstone level perhaps. Its position
    on that layer is no doubt due to volcanic upheavals&mdash;such disturbances,
    or rather the results of such disturbances, have been and are the cause of
    the greatest trouble to geologists&mdash;endless errors and controversy.
    You see we must study the country, not as it appears now, but as it would
    appear had the natural geological growth been left to mature undisturbed;
    we must restore and reconstruct such disorganized portions of the mineral
    kingdom, if you understand me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss said he understood.</p>
  <p>Steelman found an opportunity to wink sharply and severely at Smith, who
    had been careless enough to allow his features to relapse into a vacant grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is generally known even amongst the ignorant that rock grows&mdash;grows
    from the outside&mdash;but the rock here, a specimen of which I hold in my
    hand, is now in the process of decomposition; to be plain it is rotting&mdash;in
    an advanced stage of decomposition&mdash;so much so that you are not able
    to identify it with any geological period or formation, even as you may not
    be able to identify any other extremely decomposed body.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss blinked and knitted his brow, but had the presence of mind to say: &ldquo;Just
    so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had the rock on that cutting been healthy&mdash;been alive, as it
    were&mdash;you would have had your work cut out; but it is dead and has been
    dead for ages perhaps. You find less trouble in working it than you would
    ordinary clay or sand, or even gravel, which formations together are really
    rock in embryo&mdash;before birth as it were.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss&rsquo;s brow cleared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The country round here is simply rotting down&mdash;simply rotting
    down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He removed his spectacles, wiped them, and wiped his face; then his attention
    seemed to be attracted by some stones at his feet. He picked one up and examined
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; he mused, absently, &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
    wonder if there is alluvial gold in some of these creeks and gullies, perhaps
    tin or even silver, quite probably antimony.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boss seemed interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if there is any place in this neighbourhood where
    I could get accommodation for myself and my servant for a day or two?&rdquo; asked
    Steelman presently. &ldquo;I should very much like to break my journey here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said the boss. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I do&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t know of any place nearer than Pahiatua, and that&rsquo;s seven
    miles from here.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said Steelman reflectively, &ldquo;but I fully
    expected to have found a house of accommodation of some sort on the way,
    else I would have gone on in the van.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the boss. &ldquo;If you like to camp with us for
    to night, at least, and don&rsquo;t mind roughing it, you&rsquo;ll be welcome,
    I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I was sure that I would not be putting you to any trouble, or
    interfering in any way with your domestic economy&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble at all,&rdquo; interrupted the boss. &ldquo;The boys will
    be only too glad, and there&rsquo;s an empty whare where you can sleep. Better
    stay. It&rsquo;s going to be a rough night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After tea Steelman entertained the boss and a few of the more thoughtful
    members of the party with short chatty lectures on geology and other subjects.</p>
  <p>In the meantime Smith, in another part of the camp, gave selections on a
    tin whistle, sang a song or two, contributed, in his turn, to the sailor
    yarns, and ensured his popularity for several nights at least. After several
    draughts of something that was poured out of a demijohn into a pint-pot,
    his tongue became loosened, and he expressed an opinion that geology was
    all bosh, and said if he had half his employer&rsquo;s money he&rsquo;d be
    dashed if he would go rooting round in the mud like a blessed old ant-eater;
    he also irreverently referred to his learned boss as &ldquo;Old Rocks&rdquo;  over
    there. He had a pretty easy billet of it though, he said, taking it all round,
    when the weather was fine; he got a couple of notes a week and all expenses
    paid, and the money was sure; he was only required to look after the luggage
    and arrange for accommodation, grub out a chunk of rock now and then, and
    (what perhaps was the most irksome of his duties) he had to appear interested
    in old rocks and clay.</p>
  <p>Towards midnight Steelman and Smith retired to the unoccupied whare which
    had been shown them, Smith carrying a bundle of bags, blankets, and rugs,
    which had been placed at their disposal by their good-natured hosts. Smith
    lit a candle and proceeded to make the beds. Steelman sat down, removed his
    specs and scientific expression, placed the glasses carefully on a ledge
    close at hand, took a book from his bag, and commenced to read. The volume
    was a cheap copy of Jules Verne&rsquo;s <i>Journey to the Centre of the Earth</i>.
    A little later there was a knock at the door. Steelman hastily resumed the
    spectacles, together with the scientific expression, took a note-book from
    his pocket, opened it on the table, and said,  &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo; One
    of the chaps appeared with a billy of hot coffee, two pint-pots, and some
    cake. He said he thought you chaps might like a drop of coffee before you
    turned in, and the boys had forgot to ask you to wait for it down in the
    camp. He also wanted to know whether Mr Stoneleigh and his man would be all
    right and quite comfortable for the night, and whether they had blankets
    enough. There was some wood at the back of the whare and they could light
    a fire if they liked.</p>
  <p>Mr Stoneleigh expressed his thanks and his appreciation of the kindness
    shown him and his servant. He was extremely sorry to give them any trouble.</p>
  <p>The navvy, a serious man, who respected genius or intellect in any shape
    or form, said that it was no trouble at all, the camp was very dull and the
    boys were always glad to have someone come round. Then, after a brief comparison
    of opinions concerning the probable duration of the weather which had arrived,
    they bade each other good night, and the darkness swallowed the serious man.</p>
  <p>Steelman turned into the top bunk on one side and Smith took the lower on
    the other. Steelman had the candle by his bunk, as usual; he lit his pipe
    for a final puff before going to sleep, and held the light up for a moment
    so as to give Smith the full benefit of a solemn, uncompromising wink. The
    wink was silently applauded and dutifully returned by Smith. Then Steelman
    blew out the light, lay back, and puffed at his pipe for a while. Presently
    he chuckled, and the chuckle was echoed by Smith; by and by Steelman chuckled
    once more, and then Smith chuckled again. There was silence in the darkness,
    and after a bit Smith chuckled twice. Then Steelman said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake give her a rest, Smith, and give a man a show
    to get some sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then the silence in the darkness remained unbroken.</p>
  <p>The invitation was extended next day, and Steelman sent Smith on to see
    that his baggage was safe. Smith stayed out of sight for two or three hours,
    and then returned and reported all well.</p>
  <p>They stayed on for several days. After breakfast and when the men were going
    to work Steelman and Smith would go out along the line with the black bag
    and poke round amongst the &ldquo;layers and stratas&rdquo; in sight of the
    works for a while, as an evidence of good faith; then they&rsquo;d drift
    off casually into the bush, camp in a retired and sheltered spot, and light
    a fire when the weather was cold, and Steelman would lie on the grass and
    read and smoke and lay plans for the future and improve Smith&rsquo;s mind
    until they reckoned it was about dinner-time. And in the evening they would
    come home with the black bag full of stones and bits of rock, and Steelman
    would lecture on those minerals after tea.</p>
  <p>On about the fourth morning Steelman had a yarn with one of the men going
    to work. He was a lanky young fellow with a sandy complexion, and seemingly
    harmless grin. In Australia he might have been regarded as a &ldquo;cove&rdquo; rather
    than a &ldquo;chap,&rdquo; but there was nothing of the &ldquo;bloke&rdquo; about
    him. Presently the cove said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What do you think of the boss, Mr Stoneleigh? He seems to have taken
    a great fancy for you, and he&rsquo;s fair gone on geology.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think he is a very decent fellow indeed, a very intelligent young
    man. He seems very well read and well informed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t think he was a University man,&rdquo; said the
    cove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, indeed! Is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I thought you knew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman knitted his brows. He seemed slightly disturbed for the moment.
    He walked on a few paces in silence and thought hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What might have been his special line?&rdquo; he asked the cove.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, something the same as yours. I thought you knew. He was reckoned
    the best&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;the best minrologist in the country.
    He had a first-class billet in the Mines Department, but he lost it&mdash;you
    know&mdash;the booze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we will be making a move, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, later
    on, when they were private. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little too much intellect
    in this camp to suit me. But we haven&rsquo;t done so bad, anyway. We&rsquo;ve
    had three days&rsquo; good board and lodging with entertainments and refreshments
    thrown in.&rdquo; Then he said to himself: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stay for another
    day anyway. If those beggars are having a lark with us, we&rsquo;re getting
    the worth of it anyway, and I&rsquo;m not thin-skinned. They&rsquo;re the
    mugs and not us, anyhow it goes, and I can take them down before I leave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But on the way home he had a talk with another man whom we might set down
    as a &ldquo;chap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have thought the boss was a college man,&rdquo; said
    Steelman to the chap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A University man&mdash;University education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Who&rsquo;s been telling you that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of your mates.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s been getting at you. Why, it&rsquo;s all the boss
    can do to write his own name. Now that lanky sandy cove with the birth-mark
    grin&mdash;it&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s had the college education.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll make a start to-morrow,&rdquo; said Steelman
    to Smith in the privacy of their where. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s too much humour
    and levity in this camp to suit a serious scientific gentleman like myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MacquariesMate"></a>Macquarie&rsquo;s Mate</b></h2>
  <p>The chaps in the bar of Stiffner&rsquo;s shanty were talking about Macquarie,
    an absent shearer&mdash;who seemed, from their conversation, to be better
    known than liked by them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen Macquarie for ever so long,&rdquo; remarked Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks,
    after a pause. &ldquo;Wonder where he could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jail, p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps&mdash;or hell,&rdquo; growled Barcoo. &ldquo;He
    ain&rsquo;t much loss, any road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath, yer right, Barcoo!&rdquo; interposed &ldquo;Sally&rdquo; Thompson. &ldquo;But,
    now I come to think of it, Old Awful Example there was a mate of his one
    time. Bless&rsquo;d if the old soaker ain&rsquo;t comin&rsquo; to life again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A shaky, rag-and-dirt-covered framework of a big man rose uncertainly from
    a corner of the room, and, staggering forward, brushed the staring thatch
    back from his forehead with one hand, reached blindly for the edge of the
    bar with the other, and drooped heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Awful Example,&rdquo; demanded the shanty-keeper. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    up with you now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The drunkard lifted his head and glared wildly round with bloodshot eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about him! <i>Drop it</i>,
    I say! Drop it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the devil&rsquo;s the matter with you now, anyway?&rdquo; growled
    the barman.  &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em again? Hey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you talk about Macquarie! He&rsquo;s
    a mate of mine! Here! Gimme a drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if he is a mate of yours?&rdquo; sneered Barcoo. &ldquo;It
    don&rsquo;t reflec&rsquo;  much credit on you&mdash;nor him neither.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The logic contained in the last three words was unanswerable, and Awful
    Example was still fairly reasonable, even when rum oozed out of him at every
    pore. He gripped the edge of the bar with both hands, let his ruined head
    fall forward until it was on a level with his temporarily rigid arms, and
    stared blindly at the dirty floor; then he straightened himself up, still
    keeping his hold on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of you chaps,&rdquo; he said huskily; &ldquo;one of you chaps,
    in this bar to-day, called Macquarie a scoundrel, and a loafer, and a blackguard,
    and&mdash;and a sneak and a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what if we did?&rdquo; said Barcoo, defiantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    all that, and a cheat into the bargain. And now, what are you going to do
    about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man swung sideways to the bar, rested his elbow on it, and his head
    on his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a sneak and he wasn&rsquo;t a liar,&rdquo; he
    said, in a quiet, tired tone; &ldquo;and Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a cheat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old man, you needn&rsquo;t get your rag out about it,&rdquo; said
    Sally Thompson, soothingly. &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps we was a bit too hard
    on him; and it isn&rsquo;t altogether right, chaps, considerin&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    not here. But, then, you know, Awful, he might have acted straight to you
    that was his mate. The meanest blank&mdash;if he is a man at all&mdash;will
    do that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, to blazes with the old sot!&rdquo; shouted Barcoo. &ldquo;I gave
    my opinion about Macquarie, and, what&rsquo;s more, I&rsquo;ll stand to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a point for the defence,&rdquo; the
    old man went on, without heeding the interruptions. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
    a point or two for the defence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said Stiffner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place&mdash;in the first place, Macquarie never talked
    about no man behind his back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an uneasy movement, and a painful silence. Barcoo reached for
    his drink and drank slowly; he needed time to think&mdash;Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    studied his boots&mdash;Sally Thompson looked out at the weather&mdash;the
    shanty-keeper wiped the top of the bar very hard&mdash;and the rest shifted
    round and &ldquo;s&rsquo;posed they&rsquo;d try a game er cards.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barcoo set his glass down very softly, pocketed his hands deeply and defiantly,
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what of that? Macquarie was as strong as a bull, and the greatest
    bully on the river into the bargain. He could call a man a liar to his face&mdash;and
    smash his face afterwards. And he did it often, too, and with smaller men
    than himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a breath of relief in the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you want to make out that I&rsquo;m talking about a man behind
    his back?&rdquo;  continued Barcoo, threateningly, to Awful Example. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
    best take care, old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Macquarie wasn&rsquo;t a coward,&rdquo; remonstrated the drunkard,
    softly, but in an injured tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up with you, anyway?&rdquo; yelled the publican. &ldquo;What
    yer growling at? D&rsquo;ye want a row? Get out if yer can&rsquo;t be agreeable!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boozer swung his back to the bar, hooked himself on by his elbows, and
    looked vacantly out of the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got&mdash;another point for the defence,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    always best&mdash;it&rsquo;s always best to keep the last point to&mdash;the
    last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord! Well, out with it! <i>Out with it</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Macquarie&rsquo;s dead</i>! That&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Everyone moved uneasily: Sally Thompson turned the other side to the bar,
    crossed one leg behind the other, and looked down over his hip at the sole
    and heel of his elastic-side&mdash;the barman rinsed the glasses vigorously&mdash;Longbones
    shuffled and dealt on the top of a cask, and some of the others gathered
    round him and got interested&mdash;Barcoo thought he heard his horse breaking
    away, and went out to see to it, followed by Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks and a couple
    more, who thought that it might be one of their horses.</p>
  <p>Someone&mdash;a tall, gaunt, determined-looking bushman, with square features
    and haggard grey eyes&mdash;had ridden in unnoticed through the scrub to
    the back of the shanty and dismounted by the window.</p>
  <p>When Barcoo and the others re-entered the bar it soon became evident that
    Sally Thompson had been thinking, for presently he came to the general rescue
    as follows:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a blessed lot of tommy-rot about dead people in this
    world&mdash;a lot of damned old-woman nonsense. There&rsquo;s more sympathy
    wasted over dead and rotten skunks than there is justice done to straight,
    honest-livin&rsquo; chaps. I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve in this gory sentiment
    about the dead at the expense of the living. I b&rsquo;lieve in justice for
    the livin&rsquo;&mdash;and the dead too, for that matter&mdash;but justice
    for the livin&rsquo;. Macquarie was a bad egg, and it don&rsquo;t alter the
    case if he was dead a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was another breath of relief in the bar, and presently somebody said: &ldquo;Yer
    right, Sally!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good for you, Sally, old man!&rdquo; cried Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, taking
    it up.  &ldquo;An&rsquo;, besides, I don&rsquo;t b&rsquo;lieve Macquarie
    is dead at all. He&rsquo;s always dyin&rsquo;, or being reported dead, and
    then turnin&rsquo; up again. Where did you hear about it, Awful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Example ruefully rubbed a corner of his roof with the palm of his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot in what you say, Sally Thompson,&rdquo; he
    admitted slowly, totally ignoring Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks. &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ve had enough of the old fool,&rdquo; yelled Barcoo. &ldquo;Macquarie
    was a spieler, and any man that ud be his mate ain&rsquo;t much better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, take a drink and dry up, yer ole hass!&rdquo; said the man
    behind the bar, pushing a bottle and glass towards the drunkard. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye
    want a row?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old man took the bottle and glass in his shaking bands and painfully
    poured out a drink.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot in what Sally Thompson says,&rdquo; he went on,
    obstinately,  &ldquo;but&mdash;but,&rdquo; he added in a strained tone, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    another point that I near forgot, and none of you seemed to think of it&mdash;not
    even Sally Thompson nor&mdash;nor Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stiffner turned his back, and Barcoo spat viciously and impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; drivelled the drunkard, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another
    point for&mdash;for the defence&mdash;of my mate, Macquarie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, out with it! Spit it out, for God&rsquo;s sake, or you&rsquo;ll
    bust!&rdquo; roared Stiffner. &ldquo;What the blazes is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>His mate&rsquo;s alive!</i>&rdquo; yelled the old man. &ldquo;Macquarie&rsquo;s
    mate&rsquo;s alive! That&rsquo;s what it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He reeled back from the bar, dashed his glass and hat to the boards, gave
    his pants, a hitch by the waistband that almost lifted him off his feet,
    and tore at his shirt-sleeves.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make a ring, boys,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;His mate&rsquo;s alive!
    Put up your hands, Barcoo! By God, his mate&rsquo;s alive!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Someone had turned his horse loose at the rear and had been standing by
    the back door for the last five minutes. Now he slipped quietly in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keep the old fool off, or he&rsquo;ll get hurt,&rdquo; snarled Barcoo.</p>
  <p>Stiffner jumped the counter. There were loud, hurried words of remonstrance,
    then some stump-splitting oaths and a scuffle, consequent upon an attempt
    to chuck the old man out. Then a crash. Stiffner and Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks
    were down, two others were holding Barcoo back, and someone had pinned Awful
    Example by the shoulders from behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me go!&rdquo; he yelled, too blind with passion to notice the
    movements of surprise among the men before him. &ldquo;Let me go! I&rsquo;ll
    smash&mdash;any man&mdash;that&mdash;that says a word again&rsquo; a mate
    of mine behind his back. Barcoo, I&rsquo;ll have your blood! Let me go! I&rsquo;ll,
    I&rsquo;ll, I&rsquo;ll&mdash; Who&rsquo;s holdin&rsquo; me? You&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Macquarie, old mate!&rdquo; said a quiet voice.</p>
  <p>Barcoo thought he heard his horse again, and went out in a hurry. Perhaps
    he thought that the horse would get impatient and break loose if he left
    it any longer, for he jumped into the saddle and rode off.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BaldyThompson"></a>Baldy Thompson</b></h2>
  <p>Rough, squarish face, curly auburn wig, bushy grey eyebrows and moustache,
    and grizzly stubble&mdash;eyes that reminded one of Dampier the actor. He
    was a squatter of the old order&mdash;new chum, swagman, drover, shearer,
    super, pioneer, cocky, squatter, and finally bank victim. He had been through
    it all, and knew all about it.</p>
  <p>He had been in parliament, and wanted to again; but the men mistrusted
    him as Thompson, M.P., though they swore by him as old Baldy Thompson the
    squatter. His hobby was politics, and his politics were badly boxed. When
    he wasn&rsquo;t cursing the banks and government he cursed the country. He
    cursed the Labour leaders at intervals, and seemed to think that he could
    run the unions better than they could. Also, he seemed to think that he could
    run parliament better than any premier. He was generally voted a hard case,
    which term is mostly used in a kindly sense out back.</p>
  <p>He was always grumbling about the country. If a shearer or rouseabout was
    good at argument, and a bit of a politician, he hadn&rsquo;t to slave much
    at Thompson&rsquo;s shed, for Baldy would argue with him all day and pay
    for it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t put on any more men,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say to travellers. &ldquo;I
    can&rsquo;t put on a lot of men to make big cheques when there&rsquo;s no
    money in the bank to pay &rsquo;em&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve got all I can do
    to get tucker for the family. I shore nothing but burrs and grass-seed last
    season, and it didn&rsquo;t pay carriage. I&rsquo;m just sending away a flock
    of sheep now, and I won&rsquo;t make threepence a head on &rsquo;em. I had
    twenty thousand in the bank season before last, and now I can&rsquo;t count
    on one. I&rsquo;ll have to roll up my swag and go on the track myself next.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Baldy,&rdquo; they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;git out your blooming
    swag and come along with us, old man; we&rsquo;ll stick to you and see you
    through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I swear I&rsquo;d show you round first,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d reply. &ldquo;Go
    up to the store and get what rations you want. You can camp in the huts to-night,
    and I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But most likely he&rsquo;d find his way over after tea, and sit on his heels
    in the cool outside the hut, and argue with the swagmen about unionism and
    politics. And he&rsquo;d argue all night if he met his match.</p>
  <p>The track by Baldy Thompson&rsquo;s was reckoned as a good tucker track,
    especially when a dissolution of parliament was threatened. Then the guileless
    traveller would casually let Baldy know that he&rsquo;d got his name on the
    electoral list, and show some interest in Baldy&rsquo;s political opinions,
    and oppose them at first, and finally agree with them and see a lot in them&mdash;be
    led round to Baldy&rsquo;s way of thinking, in fact; and ultimately depart,
    rejoicing, with a full nose-bag, and a quiet grin for his mate.</p>
  <p>There are many camp-fire yarns about old Baldy Thompson.</p>
  <p>One New Year the shearers&mdash;shearing stragglers&mdash;roused him in
    the dead of night and told him that the shed was on fire. He came out in
    his shirt and without his wig. He sacked them all there and then, but of
    course they went to work as usual next morning. There is something sad and
    pathetic about that old practical joke&mdash;as indeed there is with all
    bush jokes. There seems a quiet sort of sadness always running through outback
    humour&mdash;whether alleged or otherwise.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the usual yarn about a jackaroo mistaking Thompson for a brother
    rouser, and asking him whether old Baldy was about anywhere, and Baldy said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, are you looking for a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, do you think I stand any show? What sort of a boss is Baldy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d tramp from here to Adelaide,&rdquo; said Baldy, &ldquo;and
    north to the Gulf country, and wouldn&rsquo;t find a worse. He&rsquo;s the
    meanest squatter in Australia. The damned old crawler! I grafted like a nigger
    for him for over fifty years&rdquo;&mdash;Baldy was over sixty&mdash;&ldquo;and
    now the old skunk won&rsquo;t even pay me the last two cheques he owes me&mdash;says
    the bank has got everything he had&mdash;that&rsquo;s an old cry of his,
    the damned old sneak; seems to expect me to go short to keep his wife and
    family and relations in comfort, and by God I&rsquo;ve done it for the last
    thirty or forty years, and I might go on the track to-morrow worse off than
    the meanest old whaler that ever humped bluey. Don&rsquo;t you have anything
    to do with Scabby Thompson, or you&rsquo;ll be sorry for it. Better tramp
    to hell than take a job from him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I think I&rsquo;ll move on. Would I stand any show for some
    tucker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Him! He wouldn&rsquo;t give a dog a crust, and like as not he&rsquo;d
    get you run in for trespass if he caught you camping on the run. But come
    along to the store and I&rsquo;ll give you enough tucker to carry you on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He patronized literature and arts, too, though in an awkward, furtive way.
    We remember how we once turned up at the station hard up and short of tucker,
    and how we entertained Baldy with some of his own ideas as ours&mdash;having
    been posted beforehand by our mate&mdash;and how he told us to get some rations
    and camp in the hut and see him in the morning.</p>
  <p>And we saw him in the morning, had another yarn with him, agreed and sympathized
    with him some more, were convinced on one or two questions which we had failed
    to see at first, cursed things in chorus with him, and casually mentioned
    that we expected soon to get some work on a political paper.</p>
  <p>And at last he went inside and brought out a sovereign. &ldquo;Wrap this
    in a piece of paper and put it in your pocket, and don&rsquo;t lose it,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>But we learnt afterwards that the best way to get along with Baldy, and
    secure his good will, was to disagree with him on every possible point.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ForAuldLangSyne"></a>For Auld Lang Syne</b></h2>
  <p>These were ten of us there on the wharf when our first mate left for Maoriland,
    he having been forced to leave Sydney because he could not get anything like
    regular work, nor anything like wages for the work he could get. He was a
    carpenter and joiner, a good tradesman and a rough diamond. He had got married
    and had made a hard fight for it during the last two years or so, but the
    result only petrified his conviction that &ldquo;a lovely man could get no
    blessed show in this condemned country,&rdquo;  as he expressed it; so he
    gave it best at last&mdash;&ldquo;chucked it up,&rdquo; as he said&mdash;left
    his wife with her people and four pounds ten, until such time as he could
    send for her&mdash;and left himself with his box of tools, a pair of hands
    that could use them, a steerage ticket, and thirty shillings.</p>
  <p>We turned up to see him off. There were ten of us all told and about twice
    as many shillings all counted. He was the first of the old push to go&mdash;we
    use the word push in its general sense, and we called ourselves the mountain
    push because we had worked in the tourist towns a good deal&mdash;he was
    the first of the mountain push to go; and we felt somehow, and with a vague
    kind of sadness or uneasiness, that this was the beginning of the end of
    old times and old things. We were plasterers, bricklayers, painters, a carpenter,
    a labourer, and a plumber, and were all suffering more or less&mdash;mostly
    more&mdash;and pretty equally, because of the dearth of regular graft, and
    the consequent frequency of the occasions on which we didn&rsquo;t hold it&mdash;the &ldquo;it&rdquo;  being
    the price of one or more long beers. We had worked together on jobs in the
    city and up-country, especially in the country, and had had good times together
    when things were locomotive, as Jack put it; and we always managed to worry
    along cheerfully when things were &ldquo;stationary.&rdquo; On more than
    one big job up the country our fortnightly spree was a local institution
    while it lasted, a thing that was looked forward to by all parties, whether
    immediately concerned or otherwise (and all were concerned more or less),
    a thing to be looked back to and talked over until next pay-day came. It
    was a matter for anxiety and regret to the local business people and publicans,
    and loafers and spielers, when our jobs were finished and we left.</p>
  <p>There were between us the bonds of graft, of old times, of poverty, of vagabondage
    and sin, and in spite of all the right-thinking person may think, say or
    write, there was between us that sympathy which in our times and conditions
    is the strongest and perhaps the truest of all human qualities, the sympathy
    of drink. We were drinking mates together. We were wrong-thinking persons
    too, and that was another bond of sympathy between us.</p>
  <p>There were cakes of tobacco, and books, and papers, and several flasks of &ldquo;rye-buck&rdquo;&mdash;our
    push being distantly related to a publican who wasn&rsquo;t half a bad sort&mdash;to
    cheer and comfort our departing mate on his uncertain way; and these tokens
    of mateship and the sake of auld lang syne were placed casually in his bunk
    or slipped unostentatiously into his hand or pockets, and received by him
    in short eloquent silence (sort of an aside silence), and partly as a matter
    of course. Every now and then there would be a surreptitious consultation
    between two of us and a hurried review of finances, and then one would slip
    quietly ashore and presently return supremely unconscious of a book, magazine,
    or parcel of fruit bulging out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>You may battle round with mates for many years, and share and share alike,
    good times or hard, and find the said mates true and straight through it
    all; but it is their little thoughtful attentions when you are going away,
    that go right down to the bottom of your heart, and lift it up and make you
    feel inclined&mdash;as you stand alone by the rail when the sun goes down
    on the sea&mdash;to write or recite poetry and otherwise make a fool of yourself.</p>
  <p>We helped our mate on board with his box, and inspected his bunk, and held
    a consultation over the merits or otherwise of its position, and got in his
    way and that of the under-steward and the rest of the crew right down to
    the captain, and superintended our old chum&rsquo;s general arrangements,
    and upset most of them, and interviewed various members of the crew as to
    when the boat would start for sure, and regarded their statements with suspicion,
    and calculated on our own account how long it would take to get the rest
    of the cargo aboard, and dragged our mate ashore for a final drink, and found
    that we had &ldquo;plenty of time to slip ashore for a parting wet&rdquo; so
    often that his immediate relations grew anxious and officious, and the universe
    began to look good, and kind, and happy, and bully, and jolly, and grand,
    and glorious to us, and we forgave the world everything wherein it had not
    acted straight towards us, and were filled full of love for our kind of both
    genders&mdash;for the human race at large&mdash;and with an almost irresistible
    longing to go aboard, and stay at all hazards, and sail along with our mate.
    We had just time  &ldquo;to slip ashore and have another&rdquo; when the
    gangway was withdrawn and the steamer began to cast off. Then a rush down
    the wharf, a hurried and confused shaking of hands, and our mate was snatched
    aboard. The boat had been delayed, and we had waited for three hours, and
    had seen our chum nearly every day for years, and now we found we hadn&rsquo;t
    begun to say half what we wanted to say to him. We gripped his hand in turn
    over the rail, as the green tide came between, till there was a danger of
    one mate being pulled aboard&mdash;which he wouldn&rsquo;t have minded much&mdash;or
    the other mate pulled ashore, or one or both yanked overboard. We cheered
    the captain and cheered the crew and the passengers&mdash;there was a big
    crowd of them going and a bigger crowd of enthusiastic friends on the wharf&mdash;and
    our mate on the forward hatch; we cheered the land they were going to and
    the land they had left behind, and sang &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; and &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    a Jolly Good Fellow&rdquo; (and so yelled all of us) and &ldquo;Home Rule
    for Ireland Evermore&rdquo;&mdash;which was, I don&rsquo;t know why, an old
    song of ours. And we shouted parting injunctions and exchanged old war cries,
    the meanings of which were only known to us, and we were guilty of such riotous
    conduct that, it being now Sunday morning, one or two of the quieter members
    suggested we had better drop down to about half-a-gale, as there was a severe-looking
    old sergeant of police with an eye on us; but once, in the middle of a heart-stirring
    chorus of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne,&rdquo;  Jack, my especial chum, paused for
    breath and said to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Joe, the trap&rsquo;s joining in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so he was&mdash;and leading.</p>
  <p>But I well remember the hush that fell on that, and several other occasions,
    when the steamer had passed the point.</p>
  <p>And so our first mate sailed away out under the rising moon and under the
    morning stars. He is settled down in Maoriland now, in a house of his own,
    and has a family and a farm; but somehow, in the bottom of our hearts, we
    don&rsquo;t like to think of things like this, for they don&rsquo;t fit in
    at all with &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
  <p>There were six or seven of us on the wharf to see our next mate go. His
    ultimate destination was known to himself and us only. We had pickets at
    the shore end of the wharf, and we kept him quiet and out of sight; the send-off
    was not noisy, but the hand-grips were very tight and the sympathy deep.
    He was running away from debt, and wrong, and dishonour, a drunken wife,
    and other sorrows, and we knew it all.</p>
  <p>Two went next&mdash;to try their luck in Western Australia; they were plasterers.
    Ten of us turned up again, the push having been reinforced by one or two
    new members and an old one who had been absent on the first occasion. It
    was a glorious send-off, and only two found beds that night&mdash;the government
    supplied the beds.</p>
  <p>And one by one and two by two they have gone from the wharf since then.
    Jack went to-day; he was perhaps the most irreclaimable of us all&mdash;a
    hard case where all cases were hard; and I loved him best&mdash;anyway I
    know that, wherever Jack goes, there will be someone who will barrack for
    me to the best of his ability (which is by no means to be despised as far
    as barracking is concerned), and resent, with enthusiasm and force if he
    deems it necessary, the barest insinuation which might be made to the effect
    that I could write a bad line if I tried, or be guilty of an action which
    would not be straight according to the rules of mateship.</p>
  <p>Ah well! I am beginning to think it is time I emigrated too; I&rsquo;ll
    pull myself together and battle round and raise the price of a steerage ticket,
    and maybe a pound or two over. There may not be anybody to see me off, but
    some of the boys are sure to be on the wharf or platform &ldquo;over there,&rdquo; when
    I arrive. Lord! I almost hear them hailing now! and won&rsquo;t I yell back!
    and perhaps there won&rsquo;t be a wake over old times in some cosy bar parlour,
    or camp, in Western Australia or Maoriland some night in a year to come.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSongsTheyusedtoSing"></a>The Songs They used
      to Sing</b></h2>
  <p>On the diggings up to twenty odd years ago&mdash;and as far back as I can
    remember&mdash;on Lambing Flat, the Pipe Clays, Gulgong, Home Rule, and so
    through the roaring list; in bark huts, tents, public-houses, sly grog shanties,
    and&mdash;well, the most glorious voice of all belonged to a bad girl. We
    were only children and didn&rsquo;t know why she was bad, but we weren&rsquo;t
    allowed to play near or go near the hut she lived in, and we were trained
    to believe firmly that something awful would happen to us if we stayed to
    answer a word, and didn&rsquo;t run away as fast as our legs could carry
    us, if she attempted to speak to us. We had before us the dread example of
    one urchin, who got an awful hiding and went on bread and water for twenty-four
    hours for allowing her to kiss him and give him lollies. She didn&rsquo;t
    look bad &mdash; she looked to us like a grand and beautiful lady-girl&mdash; but
    we got instilled into us the idea that she was an awful bad woman, something
    more terrible even than a drunken man, and one whose presence was to be feared
    and fled from. There were two other girls in the hut with her, also a pretty
    little girl, who called her &ldquo;Auntie&rdquo;, and with whom we were not
    allowed to play&mdash;for they were all bad; which puzzled us as much as
    child-minds can be puzzled. We couldn&rsquo;t make out how everybody in one
    house could be bad. We used to wonder why these bad people weren&rsquo;t
    hunted away or put in gaol if they were so bad. And another thing puzzled
    us. Slipping out after dark, when the bad girls happened to be singing in
    their house, we&rsquo;d sometimes run against men hanging round the hut by
    ones and twos and threes, listening. They seemed mysterious. They were mostly
    good men, and we concluded they were listening and watching the bad women&rsquo;s
    house to see that they didn&rsquo;t kill anyone, or steal and run away with
    any bad little boys &mdash; ourselves, for instance&mdash;who ran out after
    dark; which, as we were informed, those bad people were always on the lookout
    for a chance to do.</p>
  <p>We were told in after years that old Peter McKenzie (a respectable, married,
    hard-working digger) would sometimes steal up opposite the bad door in the
    dark, and throw in money done up in a piece of paper, and listen round until
    the bad girl had sung the &ldquo;Bonnie Hills of Scotland&rdquo; two or three
    times. Then he&rsquo;d go and get drunk, and stay drunk two or three days
    at a time. And his wife caught him throwing the money in one night, and there
    was a terrible row, and she left him; and people always said it was all a
    mistake. But we couldn&rsquo;t see the mistake then.</p>
  <p>But I can hear that girl&rsquo;s voice through the night, twenty years ago:</p>
  <p class="note">Oh! the bloomin&rsquo; heath, and the pale blue bell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my bonnet then I wore;<br>
    And memory knows no brighter theme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than those happy days of yore.<br>
    Scotland! Land of chief and song!<br>
    Oh, what charms to thee belong!</p>
  <p>And I am old enough to understand why poor Peter McKenzie &mdash; who was
    married to a Saxon, and a Tartar&mdash;went and got drunk when the bad girl
    sang  &ldquo;The Bonnie Hills of Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">His anxious eye might look in vain<br>
    For some loved form it knew!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And yet another thing puzzled us greatly at the time. Next door to the bad
    girl&rsquo;s house there lived a very respectable family&mdash; a family
    of good girls with whom we were allowed to play, and from whom we got lollies
    (those hard old red-and-white &ldquo;fish lollies&rdquo; that grocers sent
    home with parcels of groceries and receipted bills). Now one washing day,
    they being as glad to get rid of us at home as we were to get out, we went
    over to the good house and found no one at home except the grown-up daughter,
    who used to sing for us, and read &ldquo;<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>&rdquo; of
    nights, &ldquo;out loud&rdquo;, and give us more lollies than any of the
    rest&mdash;and with whom we were passionately in love, notwithstanding the
    fact that she was engaged to a &ldquo;grown-up man&rdquo;&mdash; (we reckoned
    he&rsquo;d be dead and out of the way by the time we were old enough to marry
    her). She was washing. She had carried the stool and tub over against the
    stick fence which separated her house from the bad house; and, to our astonishment
    and dismay, the bad girl had brought <i>her</i> tub over against her side
    of the fence. They stood and worked with their shoulders to the fence between
    them, and heads bent down close to it. The bad girl would sing a few words,
    and the good girl after her, over and over again. They sang very low, we
    thought. Presently the good grown-up girl turned her head and caught sight
    of us. She jumped, and her face went flaming red; she laid hold of the stool
    and carried it, tub and all, away from that fence in a hurry. And the bad
    grown-up girl took her tub back to her house. The good grown-up girl made
    us promise never to tell what we saw &mdash; that she&rsquo;d been talking
    to a bad girl&mdash;else she would never, never marry us.</p>
  <p>She told me, in after years, when she&rsquo;d grown up to be a grandmother,
    that the bad girl was surreptitiously teaching her to sing  &ldquo;Madeline&rdquo; that
    day.</p>
  <p>I remember a dreadful story of a digger who went and shot himself one night
    after hearing that bad girl sing. We thought then what a frightfully bad
    woman she must be. The incident terrified us; and thereafter we kept carefully
    and fearfully out of reach of her voice, lest we should go and do what the
    digger did.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I have a dreamy recollection of a circus on Gulgong in the roaring days,
    more than twenty years ago, and a woman (to my child-fancy a being from another

  <p class="note">Out in the cold world&mdash;out in the street&mdash;<br>
    Asking a penny from each one I meet;<br>
    Cheerless I wander about all the day,<br>
    Wearing my young life in sorrow away!</p>
  <p>That last line haunted me for many years. I remember being frightened by
    women sobbing (and one or two great grown-up diggers also) that night in
    that circus.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father, Dear Father, Come Home with Me Now&rdquo;, was a sacred song
    then, not a peg for vulgar parodies and more vulgar &ldquo;business&rdquo; for
    fourth-rate clowns and corner-men. Then there was &ldquo;The Prairie Flower&rdquo;. &ldquo;Out
    on the Prairie, in an Early Day&rdquo;&mdash;I can hear the digger&rsquo;s
    wife yet: she was the prettiest girl on the field. They married on the sly
    and crept into camp after dark; but the diggers got wind of it and rolled
    up with gold-dishes, shovels,  &amp;c., &amp;c., and gave them a real good
    tinkettling in the old-fashioned style, and a nugget or two to start housekeeping
    on. She had a very sweet voice.</p>
  <p class="note">Fair as a lily, joyous and free,<br>
    Light of the prairie home was she.</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;s a &ldquo;granny&rdquo; now, no doubt&mdash;or dead.</p>
  <p>And I remember a poor, brutally ill-used little wife, wearing a black eye
    mostly, and singing &ldquo;Love Amongst the Roses&rdquo; at her work. And
    they sang the &ldquo;Blue Tail Fly&rdquo;, and all the first and best coon
    songs&mdash; in the days when old John Brown sank a duffer on the hill.</p>

    A fresh back-log thrown behind the fire, which lights the room fitfully.
    Company settled down to pipes, subdued yarning, and reverie.</p>
  <p>Flash Jack&mdash;red sash, cabbage-tree hat on back of head with nothing
    in it, glossy black curls bunched up in front of brim. Flash Jack volunteers,
    without invitation, preparation, or warning, and through his nose:</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">There was a wild kerlonial youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;John Dowlin was his name!<br>
    He bountied on his parients,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who lived in Castlemaine!</p>
  <p>and so on to&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">He took a pistol from his breast<br>
    And waved that lit&mdash;tle toy&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Little toy&rdquo; with an enthusiastic flourish and great unction
    on Flash Jack&rsquo;s part&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight, but I won&rsquo;t surrender!&rdquo; said<br>
    The wild Kerlonial Boy.</p>
  <p>Even this fails to rouse the company&rsquo;s enthusiasm. &ldquo;Give us
    a song, Abe! Give us the &lsquo;Lowlands&rsquo;!&rdquo; Abe Mathews, bearded
    and grizzled, is lying on the broad of his back on a bench, with his hands
    clasped under his head&mdash; his favourite position for smoking, reverie,
    yarning, or singing. He had a strong, deep voice, which used to thrill me
    through and through, from hair to toenails, as a child.</p>
  <p>They bother Abe till he takes his pipe out of his mouth and puts it behind
    his head on the end of the stool:</p>
  <p class="note">The ship was built in Glasgow;<br>

  <p>The public-house people and more diggers drop into the kitchen, as all do
    within hearing, when Abe sings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then, boys:</p>
  <p class="note">And she ploughed in the Low Lands, Low!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, all together!</p>
  <p class="note">The Low Lands! The Low Lands!<br>

  <p>Toe and heel and flat of foot begin to stamp the clay floor, and horny hands
    to slap patched knees in accompaniment.</p>

  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m drifting with the current,<br>

  <p>Old Boozer Smith&mdash;a dirty gin-sodden bundle of rags on the floor in
    the corner with its head on a candle box, and covered by a horse rug&mdash; old
    Boozer Smith is supposed to have been dead to the universe for hours past,
    but the chorus must have disturbed his torpor; for, with a suddenness and
    unexpectedness that makes the next man jump, there comes a bellow from under
    the horse rug:</p>
  <p class="note">Wot though!&mdash;I wear!&mdash;a rag!&mdash;ged coat!<br>
    I&rsquo;ll wear it like a man!</p>
  <p>and ceases as suddenly as it commenced. He struggles to bring his ruined
    head and bloated face above the surface, glares round; then, no one questioning
    his manhood, he sinks back and dies to creation; and subsequent proceedings
    are only interrupted by a snore, as far as he is concerned.</p>
  <p>Little Jimmy Nowlett, the bullock-driver, is inspired. &ldquo;Go on, Jimmy!
    Give us a song!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">In the days when we were hard up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For want of wood and wire&mdash;</p>
  <p>Jimmy always blunders; it should have been &ldquo;<i>food and fire</i>&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

  <p>Jimmy does, giving his head a short, jerky nod for nearly every word, and
    describing a circle round his crown&mdash;as if he were stirring a pint of
    hot tea&mdash;with his forefinger, at the end of every line:</p>
  <p class="note">Hall!&mdash;Round!&mdash;Me&mdash;Hat!<br>

  <p>How many old diggers remember it?</p>
  <p>And:</p>
  <p class="note">A butcher, and a baker, and a quiet-looking quaker,<br>
    All a-courting pretty Jessie at the Railway Bar.</p>
  <p>I used to wonder as a child what the &ldquo;railway bar&rdquo; meant.</p>
  <p>And:</p>
  <p class="note">I would, I would, I would in vain<br>
    That I were single once again!<br>
    But ah, alas, that will not be<br>
    Till apples grow on the willow tree.</p>
  <p>A drunken gambler&rsquo;s young wife used to sing that song&mdash;to herself.</p>
  <p>A stir at the kitchen door, and a cry of &ldquo;Pinter,&rdquo; and old Poynton,
    Ballarat digger, appears and is shoved in; he has several drinks aboard,
    and they proceed to &ldquo;git Pinter on the singin&rsquo; lay,&rdquo; and
    at last talk him round. He has a good voice, but no &ldquo;theory&rdquo;,
    and blunders worse than Jimmy Nowlett with the words. He starts with a howl&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!<br>
    Way down in Covent Gar-ar-r-dings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-strolling I did go,<br>
    To see the sweetest flow-ow-wers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That e&rsquo;er in gardings grow.</p>
  <p>He saw the rose and lily&mdash;the red and white and blue&mdash; and he
    saw the sweetest flow-ow-ers that e&rsquo;er in gardings grew; for he saw
    two lovely maidens (Pinter calls &rsquo;em &ldquo;virgings&rdquo;) underneath
    (he must have meant on top of)  &ldquo;<i>a garding chair</i>&rdquo;, sings
    Pinter.</p>
  <p class="note">And one was lovely Jessie,<br>
    With the jet black eyes and hair,</p>
  <p>roars Pinter,</p>
  <p class="note">And the other was a vir-ir-ging,<br>
    I solemn-lye declare!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Maiden, Pinter!&rdquo; interjects Mr. Nowlett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all the same,&rdquo; retorts Pinter. &ldquo;A maiden <i>is</i> a
    virging, Jimmy. If you&rsquo;re singing, Jimmy, and not me, I&rsquo;ll leave
    off!&rdquo; Chorus of &ldquo;Order! Shut up, Jimmy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">I quicklye step-ped up to her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unto her did sa-a-y:<br>
    Do you belong to any young man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoh, tell me that, I pra-a-y?</p>
  <p>Her answer, according to Pinter, was surprisingly prompt and unconventional;
    also full and concise:</p>
  <p class="note">No; I belong to no young man&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I solemnlye declare!<br>
    I mean to live a virging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And still my laurels wear!</p>
  <p>Jimmy Nowlett attempts to move an amendment in favour of &ldquo;maiden&rdquo;,
    but is promptly suppressed. It seems that Pinter&rsquo;s suit has a happy
    termination, for he is supposed to sing in the character of a &ldquo;Sailor
    Bold&rdquo;, and as he turns to pursue his stroll in &ldquo;Covent Gar-ar-dings&rdquo;:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;I love a Sailor Bold!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hong-kore, Pinter! Give us the &lsquo;Golden Glove&rsquo;, Pinter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus warmed up, Pinter starts with an explanatory &ldquo;spoken&rdquo; to
    the effect that the song he is about to sing illustrates some of the little
    ways of woman, and how, no matter what you say or do, she is bound to have
    her own way in the end; also how, in one instance, she set about getting
    it.</p>
  <p class="note">Hoh!<br>
    Now, it&rsquo;s of a young squoire near Timworth did dwell,<br>
    Who courted a nobleman&rsquo;s daughter so well&mdash;</p>
  <p>The song has little or nothing to do with the &ldquo;squire&rdquo;, except
    so far as &ldquo;all friends and relations had given consent,&rdquo; and&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">The troo-soo was ordered&mdash;appointed the day,<br>
    And a farmer were appointed for to give her away&mdash;</p>
  <p>which last seemed a most unusual proceeding, considering the wedding was
    a toney affair; but perhaps there were personal interests&mdash; the nobleman
    might have been hard up, and the farmer backing him. But there was an extraordinary
    scene in the church, and things got mixed.</p>
  <p class="note">For as soon as this maiding this farmer espied:<br>
  &ldquo;Hoh, my heart! Hoh, my heart!<br>
  &ldquo;Hoh, my heart!&rdquo; then she cried.</p>
  <p>Hysterics? Anyway, instead of being wed&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">This maiden took sick and she went to her bed.</p>
  <p>(N.B.&mdash; Pinter sticks to &lsquo;<i>virging</i>&rsquo;.)</p>
  <p>Whereupon friends and relations and guests left the house in a body (a strange
    but perhaps a wise proceeding, after all&mdash;maybe they smelt a rat) and
    left her to recover alone, which she did promptly. And then:</p>
  <p class="note">Shirt, breeches, and waistcoat this maiding put on,<br>
    And a-hunting she went with her dog and her gun;<br>
    She hunted all round where this farmier did dwell,<br>
    Because in her own heart she love-ed him well.</p>
  <p>The cat&rsquo;s out of the bag now:</p>
  <p class="note">And often she fired, but no game she killed&mdash;</p>
  <p>which was not surprising&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">Till at last the young farmier came into the field&mdash;</p>
  <p>No wonder. She put it to him straight:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, why are you not at the wedding?&rdquo; she cried,<br>
  &ldquo;For to wait on the squoire, and to give him his bride.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He was as prompt and as delightfully unconventional in his reply as the
    young lady in Covent Gardings:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, no! and oh, no! For the truth I must sa-a-y,<br>
    I love her too well for to give her a-w-a-a-y!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>which was satisfactory to the disguised &ldquo;virging&rdquo;.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;. . . . and I&rsquo;d take sword in hand,<br>
    And by honour I&rsquo;d win her if she would command.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which was still more satisfactory.</p>
  <p class="note">Now this virging, being&mdash;</p>
  <p>(Jimmy Nowlett: &ldquo;Maiden, Pinter&mdash;&rdquo; Jim is thrown on a stool
    and sat on by several diggers.)</p>
  <p class="note">Now this maiding, being please-ed to see him so bold,<br>
    She gave him her glove that was flowered with gold,</p>
  <p>and explained that she found it in his field while hunting around with her
    dog and her gun. It is understood that he promised to look up the owner.
    Then she went home and put an advertisement in the local&nbsp;<i>Herald</i>;
    and that ad. must have caused considerable sensation. She stated that she
    had lost her golden glove, and</p>
  <p class="note">The young man that finds it and brings it to me,<br>
    Hoh! that very young man my husband shall be!</p>
  <p>She had a saving clause in case the young farmer mislaid the glove before
    he saw the ad., and an <i>old</i> bloke got holt of it and fetched it along.
    But everything went all right. The young farmer turned up with the glove.
    He was a very respectable young farmer, and expressed his gratitude to her
    for having &ldquo;<i>honour-ed him with her love.</i>&rdquo; They were married,
    and the song ends with a picture of the young farmeress milking the cow,
    and the young farmer going whistling to plough. The fact that they lived
    and grafted on the selection proves that I hit the right nail on the head
    when I guessed, in the first place, that the old nobleman was &ldquo;stony&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>In after years,</p>
  <p class="note">. . . she told him of the fun,<br>
    How she hunted him up with her dog and her gun.</p>
  <p>But whether he was pleased or otherwise to hear it, after years of matrimonial
    experiences, the old song doesn&rsquo;t say, for it ends there.</p>

    by his wife, of being more cheerful when on the roads than when at home.</p>

    She baked for you down by the creek?</p>
  <p>Sam Holt was, apparently, a hardened flash Jack.</p>
  <p class="note">You were not quite the cleanly potato, Sam Holt.</p>
  <p>Reference is made to his &ldquo;<i>manner of holding a flush</i>&rdquo;,
    and he is asked to remember several things which he, no doubt, would rather
    forget, including</p>
  <p class="note">. . . the hiding you got from the boys.</p>
  <p>The song is decidedly personal.</p>
  <p>But Sam Holt makes a pile and goes home, leaving many a better and worse
    man to pad the hoof Out Back. And&mdash;Jim Nowlett sang this with so much
    feeling as to make it appear a personal affair between him and the absent
    Holt&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">And, don&rsquo;t you remember the fiver, Sam Holt,<br>
    You borrowed so careless and free?<br>
    I reckon I&rsquo;ll whistle a good many tunes</p>
  <p>(with increasing feeling)</p>

    get up to ten or fifteen verses, break down, and start afresh. At last he

    wrist on his knee, and keeping time with an index finger. It was very funny,
    but the thing was taken seriously all through.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVisionofSandyBlight"></a>A Vision of Sandy
      Blight</b></h2>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been humping my back, and crouching and groaning for an hour or
    so in the darkest corner of the travellers&rsquo; hut, tortured by the demon
    of sandy blight. It was too hot to travel, and there was no one there except
    ourselves and Mitchell&rsquo;s cattle pup. We were waiting till after sundown,
    for I couldn&rsquo;t have travelled in the daylight, anyway. Mitchell had
    tied a wet towel round my eyes, and led me for the last mile or two by another
    towel&mdash; one end fastened to his belt behind, and the other in my hand
    as I walked in his tracks. And oh! but this was a relief! It was out of the
    dust and glare, and the flies didn&rsquo;t come into the dark hut, and I
    could hump and stick my knees in my eyes and groan in comfort. I didn&rsquo;t
    want a thousand a year, or anything; I only wanted relief for my eyes &mdash;that
    was all I prayed for in this world. When the sun got down a bit, Mitchell
    started poking round, and presently he found amongst the rubbish a dirty-looking
    medicine bottle, corked tight; when he rubbed the dirt off a piece of notepaper
    that was pasted on, he saw &ldquo;eye-water&rdquo; written on it. He drew
    the cork with his teeth, smelt the water, stuck his little finger in, turned
    the bottle upside down, tasted the top of his finger, and reckoned the stuff
    was all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! Wake up, Joe!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a bottle
    of tears.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bottler wot?&rdquo; I groaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eye-water,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t want to
    be poisoned or have my eyes burnt out by mistake; perhaps some burning acid
    had got into that bottle, or the label had been put on, or left on, in mistake
    or carelessness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s no harm in
    tryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I chanced it. I lay down on my back in a bunk, and Mitchell dragged my lids
    up and spilt half a bottle of eye-water over my eye-balls.</p>
  <p>The relief was almost instantaneous. I never experienced such a quick cure
    in my life. I carried the bottle in my swag for a long time afterwards, with
    an idea of getting it analysed, but left it behind at last in a camp.</p>
  <p>Mitchell scratched his head thoughtfully, and watched me for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait a bit longer,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;and
    if it doesn&rsquo;t blind you I&rsquo;ll put some in my eyes. I&rsquo;m getting
    a touch of blight myself now. That&rsquo;s the fault of travelling with a
    mate who&rsquo;s always catching something that&rsquo;s no good to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As it grew dark outside we talked of sandy-blight and fly-bite, and sand-flies
    up north, and ordinary flies, and branched off to Barcoo rot, and struck
    the track again at bees and bee stings. When we got to bees, Mitchell sat
    smoking for a while and looking dreamily backwards along tracks and branch
    tracks, and round corners and circles he had travelled, right back to the
    short, narrow, innocent bit of track that ends in a vague, misty point&mdash;like
    the end of a long, straight, cleared road in the moonlight&mdash;as far back
    as we can remember.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had about fourteen hives,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;we
    used to call them  &lsquo;swarms&rsquo;, no matter whether they were flying
    or in the box&mdash;when I left home first time. I kept them behind the shed,
    in the shade, on tables of galvanised iron cases turned down on stakes; but
    I had to make legs later on, and stand them in pans of water, on account
    of the ants. When the bees swarmed&mdash;and some hives sent out the Lord
    knows how many swarms in a year, it seemed to me&mdash; we&rsquo;d tin-kettle  &rsquo;em,
    and throw water on &rsquo;em, to make &rsquo;em believe the biggest thunderstorm
    was coming to drown the oldest inhabitant; and, if they didn&rsquo;t get
    the start of us and rise, they&rsquo;d settle on a branch&mdash; generally
    on one of the scraggy fruit trees. It was rough on the bees&mdash; come to
    think of it; their instinct told them it was going to be fine, and the noise
    and water told them it was raining. They must have thought that nature was
    mad, drunk, or gone ratty, or the end of the world had come. We&rsquo;d rig
    up a table, with a box upside down, under the branch, cover our face with
    a piece of mosquito net, have rags burning round, and then give the branch
    a sudden jerk, turn the box down, and run. If we got most of the bees in,
    the rest that were hanging to the bough or flying round would follow, and
    then we reckoned we&rsquo;d shook the queen in. If the bees in the box came
    out and joined the others, we&rsquo;d reckon we hadn&rsquo;t shook the queen
    in, and go for them again. When a hive was full of honey we&rsquo;d turn
    the box upside down, turn the empty box mouth down on top of it, and drum
    and hammer on the lower box with a stick till all the bees went up into the
    top box. I suppose it made their heads ache, and they went up on that account.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose things are done differently on proper bee-farms. I&rsquo;ve
    heard that a bee-farmer will part a hanging swarm with his fingers, take
    out the queen bee and arrange matters with her; but our ways suited us, and
    there was a lot of expectation and running and excitement in it, especially
    when a swarm took us by surprise. The yell of &lsquo;Bees swarmin&rsquo;!&rsquo; was
    as good to us as the yell of &lsquo;Fight!&rsquo; is now, or &lsquo;Bolt!&rsquo; in
    town, or &lsquo;Fire&rsquo; or &lsquo;Man overboard!&rsquo;  at sea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was tons of honey. The bees used to go to the vineyards at
    wine-making and get honey from the heaps of crushed grape-skins thrown out
    in the sun, and get so drunk sometimes that they wobbled in their bee-lines
    home. They&rsquo;d fill all the boxes, and then build in between and under
    the bark, and board, and tin covers. They never seemed to get the idea out
    of their heads that this wasn&rsquo;t an evergreen country, and it wasn&rsquo;t
    going to snow all winter. My younger brother Joe used to put pieces of meat
    on the tables near the boxes, and in front of the holes where the bees went
    in and out, for the dogs to grab at. But one old dog, &lsquo;Black Bill&rsquo;,
    was a match for him; if it was worth Bill&rsquo;s while, he&rsquo;d camp
    there, and keep Joe and the other dogs from touching the meat&mdash;once
    it was put down&mdash;till the bees turned in for the night. And Joe would
    get the other kids round there, and when they weren&rsquo;t looking or thinking,
    he&rsquo;d brush the bees with a stick and run. I&rsquo;d lam him when I
    caught him at it. He was an awful young devil, was Joe, and he grew up steady,
    and respectable, and respected&mdash;and I went to the bad. I never trust
    a good boy now. . . . Ah, well!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the first swarm we got. We&rsquo;d been talking of getting
    a few swarms for a long time. That was what was the matter with us English
    and Irish and English-Irish Australian farmers: we used to talk so much about
    doing things while the Germans and Scotch did them. And we even talked in
    a lazy, easy-going sort of way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one blazing hot day I saw father coming along the road, home
    to dinner (we had it in the middle of the day), with his axe over his shoulder.
    I noticed the axe particularly because father was bringing it home to grind,
    and Joe and I had to turn the stone; but, when I noticed Joe dragging along
    home in the dust about fifty yards behind father, I felt easier in my mind.
    Suddenly father dropped the axe and started to run back along the road towards
    Joe, who, as soon as he saw father coming, shied for the fence and got through.
    He thought he was going to catch it for something he&rsquo;d done&mdash;or
    hadn&rsquo;t done. Joe used to do so many things and leave so many things
    not done that he could never be sure of father. Besides, father had a way
    of starting to hammer us unexpectedly&mdash; when the idea struck him. But
    father pulled himself up in about thirty yards and started to grab up handfuls
    of dust and sand and throw them into the air. My idea, in the first flash,
    was to get hold of the axe, for I thought it was sun-stroke, and father might
    take it into his head to start chopping up the family before I could persuade
    him to put it (his head, I mean) in a bucket of water. But Joe came running
    like mad, yelling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Swarmer&mdash;bees! Swawmmer&mdash;bee&mdash;ee&mdash;es!
    Bring&mdash;a&mdash;tin&mdash;dish&mdash;  and&mdash;a&mdash;dippera&mdash;wa-a-ter!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ran with a bucket of water and an old frying-pan, and pretty soon
    the rest of the family were on the spot, throwing dust and water, and banging
    everything, tin or iron, they could get hold of. The only bullock bell in
    the district (if it was in the district) was on the old poley cow, and she&rsquo;d
    been lost for a fortnight. Mother brought up the rear&mdash;but soon worked
    to the front&mdash; with a baking-dish and a big spoon. The old lady&mdash;she
    wasn&rsquo;t old then&mdash;  had a deep-rooted prejudice that she could
    do everything better than anybody else, and that the selection and all on
    it would go to the dogs if she wasn&rsquo;t there to look after it. There
    was no jolting that idea out of her. She not only believed that she could
    do anything better than anybody, and hers was the only right or possible
    way, and that we&rsquo;d do everything upside down if she wasn&rsquo;t there
    to do it or show us how&mdash;but she&rsquo;d try to do things herself or
    insist on making us do them her way, and that led to messes and rows. She
    was excited now, and took command at once. She wasn&rsquo;t tongue-tied,
    and had no impediment in her speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t throw up dust!&mdash;Stop throwing up dust!&mdash; Do
    you want to smother &rsquo;em?&mdash;Don&rsquo;t throw up so much water!&mdash; Only
    throw up a pannikin at a time!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want to drown &rsquo;em?
    Bang! Keep on banging, Joe!&mdash;Look at that child! Run, someone!&mdash;run!
    you, Jack!&mdash;D&rsquo;yer want the child to be stung to death?&mdash;Take
    her inside! . . . Dy&rsquo; hear me? . . . Stop throwing up dust, Tom! [To
    father.] You&rsquo;re scaring &rsquo;em away! Can&rsquo;t you see they want
    to settle?&rsquo; [Father was getting mad and yelping: &lsquo;For Godsake
    shettup and go inside.&rsquo;] &lsquo;Throw up water, Jack! Throw up&mdash;Tom!
    Take that bucket from him and don&rsquo;t make such a fool of yourself before
    the children! Throw up water! Throw&mdash;keep on banging, children! Keep
    on banging!&rsquo; [Mother put her faith in banging.] &lsquo;There!&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    off! You&rsquo;ve lost &rsquo;em! I knew you would! I told yer&mdash;keep
    on bang&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bee struck her in the eye, and she grabbed at it!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother went home&mdash;and inside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father was good at bees&mdash;could manage them like sheep when he
    got to know their ideas. When the swarm settled, he sent us for the old washing
    stool, boxes, bags, and so on; and the whole time he was fixing the bees
    I noticed that whenever his back was turned to us his shoulders would jerk
    up as if he was cold, and he seemed to shudder from inside, and now and then
    I&rsquo;d hear a grunting sort of whimper like a boy that was just starting
    to blubber. But father wasn&rsquo;t weeping, and bees weren&rsquo;t stinging
    him; it was the bee that stung mother that was tickling father. When he went
    into the house, mother&rsquo;s other eye had bunged for sympathy. Father
    was always gentle and kind in sickness, and he bathed mother&rsquo;s eyes
    and rubbed mud on, but every now and then he&rsquo;d catch inside, and jerk
    and shudder, and grunt and cough. Mother got wild, but presently the humour
    of it struck her, and she had to laugh, and a rum laugh it was, with both
    eyes bunged up. Then she got hysterical, and started to cry, and father put
    his arm round her shoulder and ordered us out of the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They were very fond of each other, the old people were, under it
    all&mdash;right up to the end. . . . Ah, well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell pulled the swags out of a bunk, and started to fasten the nose-bags
    on.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AndyPagesRival"></a>Andy Page&rsquo;s Rival</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Tall and freckled and sandy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face of a country lout;<br>
    That was the picture of Andy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middleton&rsquo;s rouseabout.<br>
    On Middleton's wide dominions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plied the stock-whip and shears;<br>
    Hadn&rsquo;t any opinions&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>And he hadn&rsquo;t any &ldquo;ideers&rdquo;&mdash;at least, he said so
    himself&mdash; except as regarded anything that looked to him like what he
    called &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, under which heading he catalogued tyranny,
    treachery, interference with the liberty of the subject by the subject, &ldquo;blanky&rdquo; lies,
    or swindles&mdash;all things, in short, that seemed to his slow understanding
    dishonest, mean or paltry; most especially, and above all, treachery to a
    mate. <i>That</i> he could never forget. Andy was uncomfortably &ldquo;straight&rdquo;.
    His mind worked slowly and his decisions were, as a rule, right and just;
    and when he once came to a conclusion concerning any man or matter, or decided
    upon a course of action, nothing short of an earthquake or a Nevertire cyclone
    could move him back an inch&mdash;unless a conviction were severely shaken,
    and then he would require as much time to &ldquo;back&rdquo; to his starting
    point as he did to come to the decision.</p>
  <p>Andy had come to a conclusion with regard to a selector&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;name,
    Lizzie Porter&mdash;who lived (and slaved) on her father&rsquo;s selection,
    near the township corner of the run on which Andy was a general &ldquo;hand&rdquo;.
    He had been in the habit for several years of calling casually at the selector&rsquo;s
    house, as he rode to and fro between the station and the town, to get a drink
    of water and exchange the time of day with old Porter and his &ldquo;missus&rdquo;.
    The conversation concerned the drought, and the likelihood or otherwise of
    their ever going to get a little rain; or about Porter&rsquo;s cattle, with
    an occasional enquiry concerning, or reference to, a stray cow belonging
    to the selection, but preferring the run; a little, plump, saucy, white cow,
    by-the-way, practically pure white, but referred to by Andy&mdash;who had
    eyes like a blackfellow&mdash;as &ldquo;old Speckledy&rdquo;. No one else
    could detect a spot or speckle on her at a casual glance. Then after a long
    bovine silence, which would have been painfully embarrassing in any other
    society, and a tilting of his cabbage-tree hat forward, which came of tickling
    and scratching the sun-blotched nape of his neck with his little finger,
    Andy would slowly say: &ldquo;Ah, well. I must be gettin&rsquo;. So-long,
    Mr. Porter. So-long, Mrs. Porter.&rdquo; And, if <i>she</i> were in evidence &mdash;as
    she generally was on such occasions&mdash;&ldquo;So-long, Lizzie.&rdquo; And
    they&rsquo;d shout: &ldquo;So-long, Andy,&rdquo; as he galloped off from
    the jump. Strange that those shy, quiet, gentle-voiced bushmen seem the hardest
    and most reckless riders.</p>
  <p>But of late his horse had been seen hanging up outside Porter&rsquo;s for
    an hour or so after sunset. He smoked, talked over the results of the last
    drought (if it happened to rain), and the possibilities of the next one,
    and played cards with old Porter; who took to winking, automatically, at
    his &ldquo;old woman&rdquo;, and nudging, and jerking his thumb in the direction
    of Lizzie when her back was turned, and Andy was scratching the nape of his
    neck and staring at the cards.</p>
  <p>Lizzie told a lady friend of mine, years afterwards, how Andy popped the
    question; told it in her quiet way&mdash;you know Lizzie&rsquo;s quiet way
    (something of the old, privileged house-cat about her); never a sign in expression
    or tone to show whether she herself saw or appreciated the humour of anything
    she was telling, no matter how comical it might be. She had witnessed two
    tragedies, and had found a dead man in the bush, and related the incidents
    as though they were common-place.</p>
  <p>It happened one day&mdash;after Andy had been coming two or three times
    a week for about a year&mdash;that she found herself sitting with him on
    a log of the woodheap, in the cool of the evening, enjoying the sunset breeze.
    Andy&rsquo;s arm had got round her&mdash; just as it might have gone round
    a post he happened to be leaning against. They hadn&rsquo;t been talking
    about anything in particular. Andy said he wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if
    they had a thunderstorm before mornin&rsquo;&mdash; it had been so smotherin&rsquo; hot
    all day.</p>
  <p>Lizzie said, &ldquo;Very likely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy smoked a good while, then he said: &ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s a weary
    world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lizzie didn&rsquo;t say anything.</p>
  <p>By-and-bye Andy said: &ldquo;Ah, well; it&rsquo;s a lonely world, Lizzie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you feel lonely, Andy?&rdquo; asked Lizzie, after a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Lizzie; I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lizzie let herself settle, a little, against him, without either seeming
    to notice it, and after another while she said, softly: &ldquo;So do I, Andy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy knocked the ashes from his pipe very slowly and deliberately, and put
    it away; then he seemed to brighten suddenly, and said briskly: &ldquo;Well,
    Lizzie! Are you satisfied!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Andy; I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m quite sure, Andy. I&rsquo;m perfectly satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, Lizzie&mdash;it&rsquo;s settled!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But to-day&mdash;a couple of months after the proposal described above&mdash;  Andy
    had trouble on his mind, and the trouble was connected with Lizzie Porter.
    He was putting up a two-rail fence along the old log-paddock on the frontage,
    and working like a man in trouble, trying to work it off his mind; and evidently
    not succeeding&mdash; for the last two panels were out of line. He was ramming
    a post&mdash; Andy rammed honestly, from the bottom of the hole, not the
    last few shovelfuls below the surface, as some do. He was ramming the last
    layer of clay when a cloud of white dust came along the road, paused, and
    drifted or poured off into the scrub, leaving long Dave Bentley, the horse-breaker,
    on his last victim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy! Graftin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Dave,&rdquo; said Andy, in a strange voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All&mdash;all right!&rdquo; said Dave, rather puzzled. He got down,
    wondering what was up, and hung his horse to the last post but one.</p>
  <p>Dave was Andy&rsquo;s opposite in one respect: he jumped to conclusions,
    as women do; but, unlike women, he was mostly wrong. He was an old chum and
    mate of Andy&rsquo;s who had always liked, admired, and trusted him. But
    now, to his helpless surprise, Andy went on scraping the earth from the surface
    with his long-handled shovel, and heaping it conscientiously round the butt
    of the post, his face like a block of wood, and his lips set grimly. Dave
    broke out first (with bush oaths):</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you? Spit it out! What have I been doin&rsquo;  to
    you? What&rsquo;s yer got yer rag out about, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy faced him suddenly, with hatred for &ldquo;funny business&rdquo; flashing
    in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you say to my sister Mary about Lizzie Porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave started; then he whistled long and low. &ldquo;Spit it all out, Andy!&rdquo; he
    advised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You said she was travellin&rsquo; with a feller!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the harm in that? Everybody knows that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If any crawler says a word about Lizzie Porter&mdash;look here, me
    and you&rsquo;s got to fight, Dave Bentley!&rdquo; Then, with still greater
    vehemence, as though he had a share in the garment: &ldquo;Take off that
    coat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I know it!&rdquo; said Dave, with the sudden quietness that
    comes to brave but headstrong and impulsive men at a critical moment: &ldquo;Me
    and you ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to fight, Andy; and&rdquo; (with sudden energy) &ldquo;if
    you try it on I&rsquo;ll knock you into jim-rags!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, stepping close to Andy and taking him by the arm: &ldquo;Andy, this
    thing will have to be fixed up. Come here; I want to talk to you.&rdquo; And
    he led him some paces aside, inside the boundary line, which seemed a ludicrously
    unnecessary precaution, seeing that there was no one within sight or hearing
    save Dave&rsquo;s horse.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy; let&rsquo;s have it over. What&rsquo;s the
    matter with you and Lizzie Porter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> travellin&rsquo; with her, that&rsquo;s all; and
    we&rsquo;re going to get married in two years!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave gave vent to another long, low whistle. He seemed to think and make
    up his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Andy: we&rsquo;re old mates, ain&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you think I&rsquo;d tell you a blanky lie, or crawl behind
    your back? Do you? Spit it out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no, I don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always stuck up for you, Andy, and&mdash;why, I&rsquo;ve
    fought for you behind your back!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know that, Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy took his friend&rsquo;s hand mechanically, but gripped it hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Andy, I&rsquo;ll tell you straight: It&rsquo;s Gorstruth about
    Lizzie Porter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They stood as they were for a full minute, hands clasped; Andy with his
    jaw dropped and staring in a dazed sort of way at Dave. He raised his disengaged
    hand helplessly to his thatch, gulped suspiciously, and asked in a broken
    voice:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&mdash;how do you know it, Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know it? Andy, <i>I seen &rsquo;em meself!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You did, Dave?&rdquo; in a tone that suggested sorrow more than anger
    at Dave&rsquo;s part in the seeing of them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gorstruth, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Dave, who was the feller? That&rsquo;s all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. I only seen them when I was canterin&rsquo; past
    in the dusk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then how&rsquo;d you know it was a man at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wore trousers, anyway, and was as big as you; so it couldn&rsquo;t
    have been a girl. I&rsquo;m pretty safe to swear it was Mick Kelly. I saw
    his horse hangin&rsquo; up at Porter&rsquo;s once or twice. But I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do: I&rsquo;ll find out for you, Andy. And, what&rsquo;s
    more, I&rsquo;ll job him for you if I catch him!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy said nothing; his hands clenched and his chest heaved. Dave laid a
    friendly hand on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s red hot, Andy, I know. Anybody else but you and I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have cared. But don&rsquo;t be a fool; there&rsquo;s any Gorsquantity of
    girls knockin&rsquo;  round. You just give it to her straight and chuck her,
    and have done with it. You must be bad off to bother about her. Gorstruth!
    she ain&rsquo;t much to look at anyway! I&rsquo;ve got to ride like blazes
    to catch the coach. Don&rsquo;t knock off till I come back; I won&rsquo;t
    be above an hour. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to give you some points in case you&rsquo;ve
    got to fight Mick; and I&rsquo;ll have to be there to back you!&rdquo; And,
    thus taking the right moment instinctively, he jumped on his horse and galloped
    on towards the town.</p>
  <p>His dust-cloud had scarcely disappeared round a corner of the paddocks when
    Andy was aware of another one coming towards him. He had a dazed idea that
    it was Dave coming back, but went on digging another post-hole, mechanically,
    until a spring-cart rattled up, and stopped opposite him. Then he lifted
    his head. It was Lizzie herself, driving home from town. She turned towards
    him with her usual faint smile. Her small features were &ldquo;washed out&rdquo;  and
    rather haggard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But, at the sight of her, all his hatred of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;  &mdash;intensified,
    perhaps, by a sense of personal injury&mdash;came to a head, and he exploded:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Lizzie Porter! I know all about you. You needn&rsquo;t
    think you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to cotton on with me any more after this!
    I wouldn&rsquo;t be seen in a paddock with yer! I&rsquo;m satisfied about
    you! Get on out of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl stared at him for a moment thunderstruck; then she lammed into
    the old horse with a stick she carried in place of a whip.</p>
  <p>She cried, and wondered what she&rsquo;d done, and trembled so that she
    could scarcely unharness the horse, and wondered if Andy had got a touch
    of the sun, and went in and sat down and cried again; and pride came to her
    aid and she hated Andy; thought of her big brother, away droving, and made
    a cup of tea. She shed tears over the tea, and went through it all again.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Andy was suffering a reaction. He started to fill the hole before
    he put the post in; then to ram the post before the rails were in position.
    Dubbing off the ends of the rails, he was in danger of amputating a toe or
    a foot with every stroke of the adze. And, at last, trying to squint along
    the little lumps of clay which he had placed in the centre of the top of
    each post for several panels back&mdash;to assist him to take a line&mdash; he
    found that they swam and doubled, and ran off in watery angles, for his eyes
    were too moist to see straight and single.</p>
  <p>Then he threw down the tools hopelessly, and was standing helplessly undecided
    whether to go home or go down to the creek and drown himself, when Dave turned
    up again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seen her?&rdquo; asked Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you chuck her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Dave; are you sure the feller was Mick Kelly?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never said I was. How was I to know? It was dark. You don&rsquo;t
    expect I&rsquo;d &lsquo;fox&rsquo; a feller I see doing a bit of a bear-up
    to a girl, do you? It might have been you, for all I knowed. I suppose she&rsquo;s
    been talking you round?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Andy. &ldquo;But, look here, Dave;
    I was properly gone on that girl, I was, and&mdash;and I want to be sure
    I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The business was getting altogether too psychological for Dave Bentley. &ldquo;You
    might as well,&rdquo; he rapped out, &ldquo;call me a liar at once!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint that at all, Dave. I want to get at who the feller is;
    that&rsquo;s what I want to get at now. Where did you see them, and when?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I seen them Anniversary night, along the road, near Ross&rsquo; farm;
    and I seen &rsquo;em Sunday night afore that&mdash;in the trees near the
    old culvert&mdash; near Porter&rsquo;s sliprails; and I seen &rsquo;em one
    night outside Porter&rsquo;s, on a log near the woodheap. They was thick
    that time, and bearin&rsquo; up proper, and no mistake. So I can swear to
    her. Now, are you satisfied about her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Andy was wildly pitchforking his thatch under his hat with all ten fingers
    and staring at Dave, who began to regard him uneasily; then there came to
    Andy&rsquo;s eyes an awful glare, which caused Dave to step back hastily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God, Andy! Are yer goin&rsquo; ratty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Andy, wildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then what the blazes is the matter with you? You&rsquo;ll have rats
    if you don&rsquo;t look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Jimminy froth</i>!&mdash;It was <i>me</i> all the time!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was me that was with her all them nights. It was me that you seen. <i>Why,
      I popped on the woodheap</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave was taken too suddenly to whistle this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you went for her just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled Andy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;you&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Andy, hopelessly; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dave whistled now&mdash;a very long, low whistle. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re
    a bloomin&rsquo; goat, Andy, after this. But this thing&rsquo;ll have to
    be fixed up!&rdquo; and he cantered away. Poor Andy was too badly knocked
    to notice the abruptness of Dave&rsquo;s departure, or to see that he turned
    through the sliprails on to the track that led to Porter&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Half an hour later Andy appeared at Porter&rsquo;s back door, with an expression
    on his face as though the funeral was to start in ten minutes. In a tone
    befitting such an occasion, he wanted to see Lizzie.</p>
  <p>Dave had been there with the laudable determination of fixing the business
    up, and had, of course, succeeded in making it much worse than it was before.
    But Andy made it all right.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheIronBarkChip"></a>The Iron-Bark Chip</b></h2>
  <p>Dave Regan and party&mdash;bush-fencers, tank-sinkers, rough carpenters,  &amp;c.&mdash; were
    finishing the third and last culvert of their contract on the last section
    of the new railway line, and had already sent in their vouchers for the completed
    contract, so that there might be no excuse for extra delay in connection
    with the cheque.</p>
  <p>Now it had been expressly stipulated in the plans and specifications that
    the timber for certain beams and girders was to be iron-bark and no other,
    and Government inspectors were authorised to order the removal from the ground
    of any timber or material they might deem inferior, or not in accordance
    with the stipulations. The railway contractor&rsquo;s foreman and inspector
    of sub-contractors was a practical man and a bushman, but he had been a timber-getter
    himself; his sympathies were bushy, and he was on winking terms with Dave
    Regan. Besides, extended time was expiring, and the contractors were in a
    hurry to complete the line. But the Government inspector was a reserved man
    who poked round on his independent own and appeared in lonely spots at unexpected
    times &mdash;with apparently no definite object in life&mdash;like a grey
    kangaroo bothered by a new wire fence, but unsuspicious of the presence of
    humans. He wore a grey suit, rode, or mostly led, an ashen-grey horse; the
    grass was long and grey, so he was seldom spotted until he was well within
    the horizon and bearing leisurely down on a party of sub-contractors, leading
    his horse.</p>
  <p>Now iron-bark was scarce and distant on those ridges, and another timber,
    similar in appearance, but much inferior in grain and &ldquo;standing&rdquo;  quality,
    was plentiful and close at hand. Dave and party were &ldquo;about full of&rdquo;  the
    job and place, and wanted to get their cheque and be gone to another &ldquo;spec&rdquo;  they
    had in view. So they came to reckon they&rsquo;d get the last girder from
    a handy tree, and have it squared, in place, and carefully and conscientiously
    tarred before the inspector happened along, if he did. But they didn&rsquo;t.
    They got it squared, and ready to be lifted into its place; the kindly darkness
    of tar was ready to cover a fraud that took four strong men with crowbars
    and levers to shift; and now (such is the regular cussedness of things) as
    the fraudulent piece of timber lay its last hour on the ground, looking and
    smelling, to their guilty imaginations like anything but iron-bark, they
    were aware of the Government inspector drifting down upon them obliquely,
    with something of the atmosphere of a casual Bill or Jim who had dropped
    out of his easy-going track to see how they were getting on, and borrow a
    match. They had more than half hoped that, as he had visited them pretty
    frequently during the progress of the work, and knew how near it was to completion,
    he wouldn&rsquo;t bother coming any more. But it&rsquo;s the way with the
    Government. You might move heaven and earth in vain endeavour to get the &ldquo;Guvermunt&rdquo; to
    flutter an eyelash over something of the most momentous importance to yourself
    and mates and the district&mdash; even to the country; but just when you
    are leaving authority severely alone, and have strong reasons for not wanting
    to worry or interrupt it, and not desiring it to worry about you, it will
    take a fancy into its head to come along and bother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the way!&rdquo; muttered Dave to his mates. &ldquo;I
    knew the beggar would turn up! . . . And the only cronk log we&rsquo;ve had,
    too!&rdquo; he added, in an injured tone. &ldquo;If this had &rsquo;a&rsquo; been
    the only blessed iron-bark in the whole contract, it would have been all
    right. . . . Good-day, sir!&rdquo; (to the inspector). &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    hot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The inspector nodded. He was not of an impulsive nature. He got down from
    his horse and looked at the girder in an abstracted way; and presently there
    came into his eyes a dreamy, far-away, sad sort of expression, as if there
    had been a very sad and painful occurrence in his family, way back in the
    past, and that piece of timber in some way reminded him of it and brought
    the old sorrow home to him. He blinked three times, and asked, in a subdued
    tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that iron-bark?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Bentley, the fluent liar of the party, caught his breath with a jerk
    and coughed, to cover the gasp and gain time. &ldquo;I&mdash;iron-bark? Of
    course it is! I thought you would know iron-bark, mister.&rdquo; (Mister
    was silent.) &ldquo;What else d&rsquo;yer think it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dreamy, abstracted expression was back. The inspector, by-the-way, didn&rsquo;t
    know much about timber, but he had a great deal of instinct, and went by
    it when in doubt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;L&mdash;look here, mister!&rdquo; put in Dave Regan, in a tone of
    innocent puzzlement and with a blank bucolic face. &ldquo;B&mdash;but don&rsquo;t
    the plans and specifications say iron-bark? Ours does, anyway. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    git the papers from the tent and show yer, if yer like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was not necessary. The inspector admitted the fact slowly. He stooped,
    and with an absent air picked up a chip. He looked at it abstractedly for
    a moment, blinked his threefold blink; then, seeming to recollect an appointment,
    he woke up suddenly and asked briskly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did this chip come off that girder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Blank silence. The inspector blinked six times, divided in threes, rapidly,
    mounted his horse, said &ldquo;Day,&rdquo; and rode off.</p>
  <p>Regan and party stared at each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what did he do that for?&rdquo; asked Andy Page, the third
    in the party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do what for, you fool?&rdquo; enquired Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ta&mdash;take that chip for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s taking it to the office!&rdquo; snarled Jack Bentley.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&mdash;what for? What does he want to do that for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To get it blanky well analysed! You ass! Now are yer satisfied?&rdquo;  And
    Jack sat down hard on the timber, jerked out his pipe, and said to Dave,
    in a sharp, toothache tone:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gimmiamatch!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&mdash;well! what are we to do now?&rdquo; enquired Andy, who was
    the hardest grafter, but altogether helpless, hopeless, and useless in a
    crisis like this.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Grain and varnish the bloomin&rsquo; culvert!&rdquo; snapped Bentley.</p>
  <p>But Dave&rsquo;s eyes, that had been ruefully following the inspector, suddenly
    dilated. The inspector had ridden a short distance along the line, dismounted,
    thrown the bridle over a post, laid the chip (which was too big to go in
    his pocket) on top of it, got through the fence, and was now walking back
    at an angle across the line in the direction of the fencing party, who had
    worked up on the other side, a little more than opposite the culvert.</p>
  <p>Dave took in the lay of the country at a glance and thought rapidly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gimme an iron-bark chip!&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p>
  <p>Bentley, who was quick-witted when the track was shown him, as is a kangaroo
    dog (Jack ran by sight, not scent), glanced in the line of Dave&rsquo;s eyes,
    jumped up, and got a chip about the same size as that which the inspector
    had taken.</p>
  <p>Now the &ldquo;lay of the country&rdquo; sloped generally to the line from
    both sides, and the angle between the inspector&rsquo;s horse, the fencing
    party, and the culvert was well within a clear concave space; but a couple
    of hundred yards back from the line and parallel to it (on the side on which
    Dave&rsquo;s party worked their timber) a fringe of scrub ran to within a
    few yards of a point which would be about in line with a single tree on the
    cleared slope, the horse, and the fencing party.</p>
  <p>Dave took the iron-bark chip, ran along the bed of the water-course into
    the scrub, raced up the siding behind the bushes, got safely, though without
    breathing, across the exposed space, and brought the tree into line between
    him and the inspector, who was talking to the fencers. Then he began to work
    quickly down the slope towards the tree (which was a thin one), keeping it
    in line, his arms close to his sides, and working, as it were, down the trunk
    of the tree, as if the fencing party were kangaroos and Dave was trying to
    get a shot at them. The inspector, by-the-bye, had a habit of glancing now
    and then in the direction of his horse, as though under the impression that
    it was flighty and restless and inclined to bolt on opportunity. It was an
    anxious moment for all parties concerned&mdash;except the inspector. They
    didn&rsquo;t want&nbsp;<i>him</i>&nbsp;to be perturbed. And, just as Dave
    reached the foot of the tree, the inspector finished what he had to say to
    the fencers, turned, and started to walk briskly back to his horse. There
    was a thunderstorm coming. Now was the critical moment&mdash; there were
    certain prearranged signals between Dave&rsquo;s party and the fencers which
    might have interested the inspector, but none to meet a case like this.</p>
  <p>Jack Bentley gasped, and started forward with an idea of intercepting the
    inspector and holding him for a few minutes in bogus conversation. Inspirations
    come to one at a critical moment, and it flashed on Jack&rsquo;s mind to
    send Andy instead. Andy looked as innocent and guileless as he was, but was
    uncomfortable in the vicinity of &ldquo;funny business&rdquo;, and must have
    an honest excuse. &ldquo;Not that that mattered,&rdquo; commented Jack afterwards; &ldquo;it
    would have taken the inspector ten minutes to get at what Andy was driving
    at, whatever it was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Run, Andy! Tell him there&rsquo;s a heavy thunderstorm coming and
    he&rsquo;d better stay in our humpy till it&rsquo;s over. Run! Don&rsquo;t
    stand staring like a blanky fool. He&rsquo;ll be gone!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Andy started. But just then, as luck would have it, one of the fencers started
    after the inspector, hailing him as &ldquo;Hi, mister!&rdquo; He wanted to
    be set right about the survey or something &mdash;or to pretend to want to
    be set right&mdash;from motives of policy which I haven&rsquo;t time to explain
    here.</p>
  <p>That fencer explained afterwards to Dave&rsquo;s party that he &ldquo;seen
    what you coves was up to,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s why he called the inspector
    back. But he told them that after they had told their yarn&mdash;which was
    a mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come back, Andy!&rdquo; cried Jack Bentley.</p>
  <p>Dave Regan slipped round the tree, down on his hands and knees, and made
    quick time through the grass which, luckily, grew pretty tall on the thirty
    or forty yards of slope between the tree and the horse. Close to the horse,
    a thought struck Dave that pulled him up, and sent a shiver along his spine
    and a hungry feeling under it. The horse would break away and bolt! But the
    case was desperate. Dave ventured an interrogatory &ldquo;Cope, cope, cope?&rdquo; The
    horse turned its head wearily and regarded him with a mild eye, as if he&rsquo;d
    expected him to come, and come on all fours, and wondered what had kept him
    so long; then he went on thinking. Dave reached the foot of the post; the
    horse obligingly leaning over on the other leg. Dave reared head and shoulders
    cautiously behind the post, like a snake; his hand went up twice, swiftly&mdash;the
    first time he grabbed the inspector&rsquo;s chip, and the second time he
    put the iron-bark one in its place. He drew down and back, and scuttled off
    for the tree like a gigantic tailless &ldquo;goanna&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>A few minutes later he walked up to the culvert from along the creek, smoking
    hard to settle his nerves.</p>
  <p>The sky seemed to darken suddenly; the first great drops of the thunderstorm
    came pelting down. The inspector hurried to his horse, and cantered off along
    the line in the direction of the fettlers&rsquo; camp.</p>
  <p>He had forgotten all about the chip, and left it on top of the post!</p>
  <p>Dave Regan sat down on the beam in the rain and swore comprehensively.</p>

      Peter&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
    The First Born</b></h3>
  <p>The struggling&nbsp;squatter is to be found in Australia as well as the &ldquo;struggling
    farmer&rdquo;. The Australian squatter is not always the mighty wool king
    that English and American authors and other uninformed people apparently
    imagine him to be. Squatting, at the best, is but a game of chance. It depends
    mainly on the weather, and that, in New South Wales at least, depends on
    nothing.</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton was a struggling squatter, with a station some distance to
    the westward of the furthest line reached by the ordinary &ldquo;new chum&rdquo;.
    His run, at the time of our story, was only about six miles square, and his
    stock was limited in proportion. The hands on Joe&rsquo;s run consisted of
    his brother Dave, a middle-aged man known only as &ldquo;Middleton&rsquo;s
    Peter&rdquo; (who had been in the service of the Middleton family ever since
    Joe Middleton could remember), and an old black shepherd, with his gin and
    two boys.</p>
  <p>It was in the first year of Joe&rsquo;s marriage. He had married a very
    ordinary girl, as far as Australian girls go, but in his eyes she was an
    angel. He really worshipped her.</p>
  <p>One sultry afternoon in midsummer all the station hands, with the exception
    of Dave Middleton, were congregated about the homestead door, and it was
    evident from their solemn faces that something unusual was the matter. They
    appeared to be watching for something or someone across the flat, and the
    old black shepherd, who had been listening intently with bent head, suddenly
    straightened himself up and cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear the cart. I can see it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>You must bear in mind that our blackfellows do not always talk the gibberish
    with which they are credited by story writers.</p>
  <p>It was not until some time after Black Bill had spoken that the white &mdash; or,
    rather, the brown &mdash; portion of the party could see or even hear the
    approaching vehicle. At last, far out through the trunks of the native apple-trees,
    the cart was seen approaching; and as it came nearer it was evident that
    it was being driven at a break-neck pace, the horses cantering all the way,
    while the motion of the cart, as first one wheel and then the other sprang
    from a root or a rut, bore a striking resemblance to the Highland Fling.
    There were two persons in the cart. One was Mother Palmer, a stout, middle-aged
    party (who sometimes did the duties of a midwife), and the other was Dave
    Middleton, Joe&rsquo;s brother.</p>
  <p>The cart was driven right up to the door with scarcely any abatement of
    speed, and was stopped so suddenly that Mrs. Palmer was sent sprawling on
    to the horse&rsquo;s rump. She was quickly helped down, and, as soon as she
    had recovered sufficient breath, she followed Black Mary into the bedroom
    where young Mrs. Middleton was lying, looking very pale and frightened. The
    horse which had been driven so cruelly had not done blowing before another
    cart appeared, also driven very fast. It contained old Mr. and Mrs. Middleton,
    who lived comfortably on a small farm not far from Palmer&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>As soon as he had dumped Mrs. Palmer, Dave Middleton left the cart and,
    mounting a fresh horse which stood ready saddled in the yard, galloped off
    through the scrub in a different direction.</p>
  <p>Half an hour afterwards Joe Middleton came home on a horse that had been
    almost ridden to death. His mother came out at the sound of his arrival,
    and he anxiously asked her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you find Doc. Wild?&rdquo; asked the mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, confound him!&rdquo; exclaimed Joe bitterly. &ldquo;He promised
    me faithfully to come over on Wednesday and stay until Maggie was right again.
    Now he has left Dean&rsquo;s and gone &mdash; Lord knows where. I suppose
    he is drinking again. How is Maggie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all over now &mdash; the child is born. It&rsquo;s a boy;
    but she is very weak. Dave got Mrs. Palmer here just in time. I had better
    tell you at once that Mrs. Palmer says if we don&rsquo;t get a doctor here
    to-night poor Maggie won&rsquo;t live.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! and what am I to do?&rdquo; cried Joe desperately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is there any other doctor within reach?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; there is only the one at B&mdash;&mdash;; that&rsquo;s forty
    miles away, and he is laid up with the broken leg he got in the buggy accident.
    Where&rsquo;s Dave?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone to Black&rsquo;s shanty. One of Mrs. Palmer&rsquo;s sons thought
    he remembered someone saying that Doc. Wild was there last week. That&rsquo;s
    fifteen miles away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it is our only hope,&rdquo; said Joe dejectedly. &ldquo;I wish
    to God that I had taken Maggie to some civilised place a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild was a well-known character among the bushmen of New South Wales,
    and although the profession did not recognise him, and denounced him as an
    empiric, his skill was undoubted. Bushmen had great faith in him, and would
    often ride incredible distances in order to bring him to the bedside of a
    sick friend. He drank fearfully, but was seldom incapable of treating a patient;
    he would, however, sometimes be found in an obstinate mood and refuse to
    travel to the side of a sick person, and then the devil himself could not
    make the doctor budge. But for all this he was very generous &mdash; a fact
    that could, no doubt, be testified to by many a grateful sojourner in the
    lonely bush.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II<br>
    The Only Hope</b></h3>
  <p>Night came on, and still there was no change in the condition of the young
    wife, and no sign of the doctor. Several stockmen from the neighbouring stations,
    hearing that there was trouble at Joe Middleton&rsquo;s, had ridden over,
    and had galloped off on long, hopeless rides in search of a doctor. Being
    generally free from sickness themselves, these bushmen look upon it as a
    serious business even in its mildest form; what is more, their sympathy is
    always practical where it is possible for it to be so. One day, while out
    on the run after an &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo;, Joe Middleton was badly thrown
    from his horse, and the break-neck riding that was done on that occasion
    from the time the horse came home with empty saddle until the rider was safe
    in bed and attended by a doctor was something extraordinary, even for the
    bush.</p>
  <p>Before the time arrived when Dave Middleton might reasonably have been expected
    to return, the station people were anxiously watching for him, all except
    the old blackfellow and the two boys, who had gone to yard the sheep.</p>
  <p>The party had been increased by Jimmy Nowlett, the bullocky, who had just
    arrived with a load of fencing wire and provisions for Middleton. Jimmy was
    standing in the moonlight, whip in hand, looking as anxious as the husband
    himself, and endeavouring to calculate by mental arithmetic the exact time
    it ought to take Dave to complete his double journey, taking into consideration
    the distance, the obstacles in the way, and the chances of horse-flesh.</p>
  <p>But the time which Jimmy fixed for the arrival came without Dave.</p>
  <p>Old Peter (as he was generally called, though he was not really old) stood
    aside in his usual sullen manner, his hat drawn down over his brow and eyes,
    and nothing visible but a thick and very horizontal black beard, from the
    depth of which emerged large clouds of very strong tobacco smoke, the product
    of a short, black, clay pipe.</p>
  <p>They had almost given up all hope of seeing Dave return that night, when
    Peter slowly and deliberately removed his pipe and grunted:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a-comin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He then replaced the pipe, and smoked on as before.</p>
  <p>All listened, but not one of them could hear a sound.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer ears must be pretty sharp for yer age, Peter. We can&rsquo;t
    hear him,&rdquo; remarked Jimmy Nowlett.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His dog ken,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>The pipe was again removed and its abbreviated stem pointed in the direction
    of Dave&rsquo;s cattle dog, who had risen beside his kennel with pointed
    ears, and was looking eagerly in the direction from which his master was
    expected to come.</p>
  <p>Presently the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs was distinctly heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can hear two horses,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett excitedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one,&rdquo; said old Peter quietly.</p>
  <p>A few moments passed, and a single horseman appeared on the far side of
    the flat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Doc. Wild on Dave&rsquo;s horse,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett. &ldquo;Dave
    don&rsquo;t ride like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Dave,&rdquo; said Peter, replacing his pipe and looking
    more unsociable than ever.</p>
  <p>Dave rode up and, throwing himself wearily from the saddle, stood ominously
    silent by the side of his horse.</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton said nothing, but stood aside with an expression of utter
    hopelessness on his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo; asked Jimmy Nowlett at last, addressing Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s there,&rdquo; answered Dave, impatiently.</p>
  <p>This was not the answer they expected, but nobody seemed surprised.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here old Peter removed his pipe, and pronounced the one word &mdash;  &ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you mean by that?&rdquo; muttered Dave, whose patience
    had evidently been severely tried by the clever but intemperate bush doctor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How drunk?&rdquo; explained Peter, with great equanimity.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stubborn drunk, blind drunk, beastly drunk, dead drunk, and damned
    well drunk, if that&rsquo;s what you want to know!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did Doc. say?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Said he was sick &mdash; had lumbago &mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t come
    for the Queen of England; said he wanted a course of treatment himself. Curse
    him! I have no patience to talk about him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him a course of treatment,&rdquo; muttered Jimmy viciously,
    trailing the long lash of his bullock-whip through the grass and spitting
    spitefully at the ground.</p>
  <p>Dave turned away and joined Joe, who was talking earnestly to his mother
    by the kitchen door. He told them that he had spent an hour trying to persuade
    Doc. Wild to come, and, that before he had left the shanty, Black had promised
    him faithfully to bring the doctor over as soon as his obstinate mood wore
    off.</p>
  <p>Just then a low moan was heard from the sick room, followed by the sound
    of Mother Palmer&rsquo;s voice calling old Mrs. Middleton, who went inside
    immediately.</p>
  <p>No one had noticed the disappearance of Peter, and when he presently returned
    from the stockyard, leading the only fresh horse that remained, Jimmy Nowlett
    began to regard him with some interest. Peter transferred the saddle from
    Dave&rsquo;s horse to the other, and then went into a small room off the
    kitchen, which served him as a bedroom; from it he soon returned with a formidable-looking
    revolver, the chambers of which he examined in the moonlight in full view
    of all the company. They thought for a moment the man had gone mad. Old Middleton
    leaped quickly behind Nowlett, and Black Mary, who had come out to the cask
    at the corner for a dipper of water, dropped the dipper and was inside like
    a shot. One of the black boys came softly up at that moment; as soon as his
    sharp eye &ldquo;spotted&rdquo; the weapon, he disappeared as though the
    earth had swallowed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the mischief are yer goin&rsquo; ter do, Peter?&rdquo; asked
    Jimmy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Goin&rsquo; to fetch him,&rdquo; said Peter, and, after carefully
    emptying his pipe and replacing it in a leather pouch at his belt, he mounted
    and rode off at an easy canter.</p>
  <p>Jimmy watched the horse until it disappeared at the edge of the flat, and
    then after coiling up the long lash of his bullock-whip in the dust until
    it looked like a sleeping snake, he prodded the small end of the long pine
    handle into the middle of the coil, as though driving home a point, and said
    in a tone of intense conviction:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll fetch him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>III<br>
    Doc. Wild</b></h3>
  <p>Peter gradually increased his horse&rsquo;s speed along the rough bush track
    until he was riding at a good pace. It was ten miles to the main road, and
    five from there to the shanty kept by Black.</p>
  <p>For some time before Peter started the atmosphere had been very close and
    oppressive. The great black edge of a storm-cloud had risen in the east,
    and everything indicated the approach of a thunderstorm. It was not long
    coming. Before Peter had completed six miles of his journey, the clouds rolled
    over, obscuring the moon, and an Australian thunderstorm came on with its
    mighty downpour, its blinding lightning, and its earth-shaking thunder. Peter
    rode steadily on, only pausing now and then until a flash revealed the track
    in front of him.</p>
  <p>Black&rsquo;s shanty &mdash; or, rather, as the sign had it, &ldquo;Post
    Office and General Store&rdquo; &mdash; was, as we have said, five miles
    along the main road from the point where Middleton&rsquo;s track joined it.
    The building was of the usual style of bush architecture. About two hundred
    yards nearer the creek, which crossed the road further on, stood a large
    bark and slab stable, large enough to have met the requirements of a legitimate
    bush &ldquo;public&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The reader may doubt that a &ldquo;sly grog shop&rdquo; could openly carry
    on business on a main Government road along which mounted troopers were continually
    passing. But then, you see, mounted troopers get thirsty like other men;
    moreover, they could always get their thirst quenched &lsquo;gratis&rsquo; at
    these places; so the reader will be prepared to hear that on this very night
    two troopers&rsquo;  horses were stowed snugly away in the stable, and two
    troopers were stowed snugly away in the back room of the shanty, sleeping
    off the effects of their cheap but strong potations.</p>
  <p>There were two rooms, of a sort, attached to the stables &mdash; one at
    each end. One was occupied by a man who was &ldquo;generally useful&rdquo;,
    and the other was the surgery, office, and bedroom&nbsp;<i>pro tem.</i>&nbsp;of
    Doc. Wild.</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild was a tall man, of spare proportions. He had a cadaverous face,
    black hair, bushy black eyebrows, eagle nose, and eagle eyes. He never slept
    while he was drinking. On this occasion he sat in front of the fire on a
    low three-legged stool. His knees were drawn up, his toes hooked round the
    front legs of the stool, one hand resting on one knee, and one elbow (the
    hand supporting the chin) resting on the other. He was staring intently into
    the fire, on which an old black saucepan was boiling and sending forth a
    pungent odour of herbs. There seemed something uncanny about the doctor as
    the red light of the fire fell on his hawk-like face and gleaming eyes. He
    might have been Mephistopheles watching some infernal brew.</p>
  <p>He had sat there some time without stirring a finger, when the door suddenly
    burst open and Middleton&rsquo;s Peter stood within, dripping wet. The doctor
    turned his black, piercing eyes upon the intruder (who regarded him silently)
    for a moment, and then asked quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the hell do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what do you want me for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want you to come to Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife. She&rsquo;s bad,&rdquo; said
    Peter calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; shouted the doctor. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    brought enough horse-stealers into the world already. If any more want to
    come they can go to blazes for me. Now, you get out of this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get yer rag out,&rdquo; said Peter quietly. &ldquo;The
    hoss-stealer&rsquo;s come, an&rsquo; nearly killed his mother ter begin with;
    an&rsquo; if yer don&rsquo;t get yer physic-box an&rsquo; come wi&rsquo; me,
    by the great God I&rsquo;ll &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Here the revolver was produced and pointed at Doc. Wild&rsquo;s head. The
    sight of the weapon had a sobering effect upon the doctor. He rose, looked
    at Peter critically for a moment, knocked the weapon out of his hand, and
    said slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wall, ef the case es as serious as that, I (hic) reckon I&rsquo;d
    better come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter was still of the same opinion, so Doc. Wild proceeded to get his medicine
    chest ready. He explained afterwards, in one of his softer moments, that
    the shooter didn&rsquo;t frighten him so much as it touched his memory  &mdash; &ldquo;sorter
    put him in mind of the old days in California, and made him think of the
    man he might have been,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d say, &mdash; &ldquo;kinder touched
    his heart and slid the durned old panorama in front of him like a flash;
    made him think of the time when he slipped three leaden pills into &lsquo;Blue
    Shirt&rsquo; for winking at a new chum behind his (the Doc.&rsquo;s) back
    when he was telling a truthful yarn, and charged the said &lsquo;Blue Shirt&rsquo; a
    hundred dollars for extracting the said pills.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe Middleton&rsquo;s wife is a grandmother now.</p>
  <p>Peter passed after the manner of his sort; he was found dead in his bunk.</p>
  <p>Poor Doc. Wild died in a shepherd&rsquo;s hut at the Dry Creeks. The shepherds
    (white men) found him, &ldquo;naked as he was born and with the hide half
    burned off him with the sun,&rdquo; rounding up imaginary snakes on a dusty
    clearing, one blazing hot day. The hut-keeper had some &ldquo;quare&rdquo; (queer)
    experiences with the doctor during the next three days and used, in after
    years, to tell of them, between the puffs of his pipe, calmly and solemnly
    and as if the story was rather to the doctor&rsquo;s credit than otherwise.
    The shepherds sent for the police and a doctor, and sent word to Joe Middleton.
    Doc. Wild was sensible towards the end. His interview with the other doctor
    was characteristic. &ldquo;And, now you see how far I am,&rdquo; he said
    in conclusion &mdash; &ldquo;have you brought the brandy?&rdquo; The other
    doctor had. Joe Middleton came with his waggonette, and in it the softest
    mattress and pillows the station afforded. He also, in his innocence, brought
    a dozen of soda-water. Doc. Wild took Joe&rsquo;s hand feebly, and, a little
    later, he &ldquo;passed out&rdquo; (as he would have said) murmuring &ldquo;something
    that sounded like poetry&rdquo;, in an unknown tongue. Joe took the body
    to the home station. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the boss bringin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked
    the shearers, seeing the waggonette coming very slowly and the boss walking
    by the horses&rsquo; heads. &ldquo;Doc. Wild,&rdquo; said a station hand. &ldquo;Take
    yer hats off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They buried him with bush honours, and chiselled his name on a slab of bluegum &mdash; a
    wood that lasts.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMysteryofDaveRegan"></a>The Mystery of Dave
      Regan</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;then there was Dave Regan,&rdquo; said the traveller. &ldquo;Dave
    used to die oftener than any other bushman I knew. He was always being reported
    dead and turnin&rsquo; up again. He seemed to like it &mdash; except once,
    when his brother drew his money and drank it all to drown his grief at what
    he called Dave&rsquo;s  &lsquo;untimely end&rsquo;. Well, Dave went up to
    Queensland once with cattle, and was away three years and reported dead,
    as usual. He was drowned in the Bogan this time while tryin&rsquo; to swim
    his horse acrost a flood &mdash; and his sweetheart hurried up and got spliced
    to a worse man before Dave got back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day I was out in the bush lookin&rsquo; for timber, when
    the biggest storm ever knowed in that place come on. There was hail in it,
    too, as big as bullets, and if I hadn&rsquo;t got behind a stump and crouched
    down in time I&rsquo;d have been riddled like a &mdash; like a bushranger.
    As it was, I got soakin&rsquo; wet. The storm was over in a few minutes,
    the water run off down the gullies, and the sun come out and the scrub steamed &mdash; and
    stunk like a new pair of moleskin trousers. I went on along the track, and
    presently I seen a long, lanky chap get on to a long, lanky horse and ride
    out of a bush yard at the edge of a clearin&rsquo;. I knowed it was Dave
    d&rsquo;reckly I set eyes on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave used to ride a tall, holler-backed thoroughbred with a body
    and limbs like a kangaroo dog, and it would circle around you and sidle away
    as if it was frightened you was goin&rsquo; to jab a knife into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello! Dave!&rsquo; said I, as he came spurrin&rsquo; up. &lsquo;How
    are yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer gettin&rsquo; on?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, before we could say any more, that horse shied away and broke
    off through the scrub to the right. I waited, because I knowed Dave would
    come back again if I waited long enough; and in about ten minutes he came
    sidlin&rsquo; in from the scrub to the left.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; says he, spurrin&rsquo; up
    sideways; &lsquo;How are you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How&rsquo;s the old people?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t been home yet,&rsquo; says he, holdin&rsquo; out
    his hand; but, afore I could grip it, the cussed horse sidled off to the
    south end of the clearin&rsquo; and broke away again through the scrub.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard Dave swearin&rsquo; about the country for twenty minutes
    or so, and then he came spurrin&rsquo; and cursin&rsquo; in from the other
    end of the clearin&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Where have you been all this time?&rsquo; I said, as the horse
    came curvin&rsquo; up like a boomerang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Gulf country,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That was a storm, Dave,&rsquo; said I.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;My oath!&rsquo; says Dave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Get caught in it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Got to shelter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re as dry&rsquo;s a bone, Dave!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned. &lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; and &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; the &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he
    yelled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said that to the horse as it boomeranged off again and broke away
    through the scrub. I waited; but he didn&rsquo;t come back, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d got so far away before he could pull up that he didn&rsquo;t think
    it worth while comin&rsquo; back; so I went on. By-and-bye I got thinkin&rsquo;.
    Dave was as dry as a bone, and I knowed that he hadn&rsquo;t had time to
    get to shelter, for there wasn&rsquo;t a shed within twelve miles. He wasn&rsquo;t
    only dry, but his coat was creased and dusty too &mdash; same as if he&rsquo;d
    been sleepin&rsquo; in a holler log; and when I come to think of it, his
    face seemed thinner and whiter than it used ter, and so did his hands and
    wrists, which always stuck a long way out of his coat-sleeves; and there
    was blood on his face &mdash; but I thought he&rsquo;d got scratched with
    a twig. (Dave used to wear a coat three or four sizes too small for him,
    with sleeves that didn&rsquo;t come much below his elbows and a tail that
    scarcely reached his waist behind.) And his hair seemed dark and lank, instead
    of bein&rsquo; sandy and stickin&rsquo; out like an old fibre brush, as it
    used ter. And then I thought his voice sounded different, too. And, when
    I enquired next day, there was no one heard of Dave, and the chaps reckoned
    I must have been drunk, or seen his ghost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t seem all right at all &mdash; it worried me a lot.
    I couldn&rsquo;t make out how Dave kept dry; and the horse and saddle and
    saddle-cloth was wet. I told the chaps how he talked to me and what he said,
    and how he swore at the horse; but they only said it was Dave&rsquo;s ghost
    and nobody else&rsquo;s. I told &rsquo;em about him bein&rsquo; dry as a
    bone after gettin&rsquo; caught in that storm; but they only laughed and
    said it was a dry place where Dave went to. I talked and argued about it
    until the chaps began to tap their foreheads and wink &mdash; then I left
    off talking. But I didn&rsquo;t leave off thinkin&rsquo; &mdash; I always
    hated a mystery. Even Dave&rsquo;s father told me that Dave couldn&rsquo;t
    be alive or else his ghost wouldn&rsquo;t be round &mdash; he said he knew
    Dave better than that. One or two fellers did turn up afterwards that had
    seen Dave about the time that I did &mdash; and then the chaps said they
    was sure that Dave was dead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But one fine day, as a lot of us chaps was playin&rsquo; pitch and
    toss at the shanty, one of the fellers yelled out:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By Gee! Here comes Dave Regan!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I looked up and saw Dave himself, sidlin&rsquo; out of a cloud
    of dust on a long lanky horse. He rode into the stockyard, got down, hung
    his horse up to a post, put up the rails, and then come slopin&rsquo; towards
    us with a half-acre grin on his face. Dave had long, thin bow-legs, and when
    he was on the ground he moved as if he was on roller skates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;El-lo, Dave!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;How are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jim!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;How the blazes are
    you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; says I, shakin&rsquo; hands. &lsquo;How
    are yer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right!&rsquo; he says. &lsquo;How are yer
    poppin&rsquo; up!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, when we&rsquo;d got all that settled, and the other chaps had
    asked how he was, he said: &lsquo;Ah, well! Let&rsquo;s have a drink.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And all the other chaps crawfished up and flung themselves round
    the corner and sidled into the bar after Dave. We had a lot of talk, and
    he told us that he&rsquo;d been down before, but had gone away without seein&rsquo; any
    of us, except me, because he&rsquo;d suddenly heard of a mob of cattle at
    a station two hundred miles away; and after a while I took him aside and
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Dave! Do you remember the day I met you after the
    storm?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He scratched his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, yes,&rsquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did you get under shelter that day?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why &mdash; no.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then how the blazes didn&rsquo;t yer get wet?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dave grinned; then he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, when I seen the storm coming I took off me clothes and
    stuck &rsquo;em in a holler log till the rain was over.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he says, after the other coves had done laughin&rsquo;,
    but before I&rsquo;d done thinking; &lsquo;I kept my clothes dry and got
    a good refreshin&rsquo;  shower-bath into the bargain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he scratched the back of his neck with his little finger, and
    dropped his jaw, and thought a bit; then he rubbed the top of his head and
    his shoulder, reflective-like, and then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t reckon for them there blanky hailstones.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonMatrimony"></a>Mitchell on Matrimony</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;suppose your wife will be glad to see you,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to his mate in their camp by the dam at Hungerford. They were overhauling
    their swags, and throwing away the blankets, and calico, and old clothes,
    and rubbish they didn&rsquo;t want&mdash;everything, in fact, except their
    pocket-books and letters and portraits, things which men carry about with
    them always, that are found on them when they die, and sent to their relations
    if possible. Otherwise they are taken in charge by the constable who officiates
    at the inquest, and forwarded to the Minister of Justice along with the depositions.</p>
  <p>It was the end of the shearing season. Mitchell and his mate had been lucky
    enough to get two good sheds in succession, and were going to take the coach
    from Hungerford to Bourke on their way to Sydney. The morning stars were
    bright yet, and they sat down to a final billy of tea, two dusty Johnny-cakes,
    and a scrag of salt mutton.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll be
    glad to see her too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you will,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He placed his pint-pot
    between his feet, rested his arm against his knee, and stirred the tea meditatively
    with the handle of his pocket-knife. It was vaguely understood that Mitchell
    had been married at one period of his chequered career.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever understood women properly,&rdquo; he
    said, as he took a cautious sip to see if his tea was cool and sweet enough,
    for his lips were sore; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think we ever will&mdash;we
    never took the trouble to try, and if we did it would be only wasted brain
    power that might just as well be spent on the blackfellow&rsquo;s lingo;
    because by the time you&rsquo;ve learnt it they&rsquo;ll be extinct, and
    woman &lsquo;ll be extinct before you&rsquo;ve learnt her. . . . The morning
    star looks bright, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Mitchell after a while,  &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
    many little things we might try to understand women in. I read in a piece
    of newspaper the other day about how a man changes after he&rsquo;s married;
    how he gets short, and impatient, and bored (which is only natural), and
    sticks up a wall of newspaper between himself and his wife when he&rsquo;s
    at home; and how it comes like a cold shock to her, and all her air-castles
    vanish, and in the end she often thinks about taking the baby and the clothes
    she stands in, and going home for sympathy and comfort to mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she never got a word of sympathy from her mother in her life,
    nor a day&rsquo;s comfort at home before she was married; but that doesn&rsquo;t
    make the slightest difference. It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference in your
    case either, if you haven&rsquo;t been acting like a dutiful son-in-law.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somebody wrote that a woman&rsquo;s love is her whole existence,
    while a man&rsquo;s love is only part of his&mdash;which is true, and only
    natural and reasonable, all things considered. But women never consider as
    a rule. A man can&rsquo;t go on talking lovey-dovey talk for ever, and listening
    to his young wife&rsquo;s prattle when he&rsquo;s got to think about making
    a living, and nursing her and answering her childish questions and telling
    her he loves his little ownest every minute in the day, while the bills are
    running up, and rent mornings begin to fly round and hustle and crowd him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got her and he&rsquo;s satisfied; and if the truth is
    known he loves her really more than he did when they were engaged, only she
    won&rsquo;t be satisfied about it unless he tells her so every hour in the
    day. At least that&rsquo;s how it is for the first few months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a woman doesn&rsquo;t understand these things&mdash;she never
    will, she can&rsquo;t&mdash; and it would be just as well for us to try and
    understand that she doesn&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t understand them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell knocked the tea-leaves out of his pannikin against his boot, and
    reached for the billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many little things we might do that seem mere trifles
    and nonsense to us, but mean a lot to her; that wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble
    or sacrifice to us, but might help to make her life happy. It&rsquo;s just
    because we never think about these little things&mdash;don&rsquo;t think
    them worth thinking about, in fact&mdash; they never enter our intellectual
    foreheads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For instance, when you&rsquo;re going out in the morning you might
    put your arms round her and give her a hug and a kiss, without her having
    to remind you. You may forget about it and never think any more of it&mdash; but
    she will.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be any trouble to you, and would only take a couple
    of seconds, and would give her something to be happy about when you&rsquo;re
    gone, and make her sing to herself for hours while she bustles about her
    work and thinks up what she&rsquo;ll get you for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate sighed, and shifted the sugar-bag over towards Mitchell.
    He seemed touched and bothered over something.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then again,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;it mightn&rsquo;t be convenient
    for you to go home to dinner&mdash;something might turn up during the morning&mdash; you
    might have some important business to do, or meet some chaps and get invited
    to lunch and not be very well able to refuse, when it&rsquo;s too late, or
    you haven&rsquo;t a chance to send a message to your wife. But then again,
    chaps and business seem very big things to you, and only little things to
    the wife; just as lovey-dovey talk is important to her and nonsense to you.
    And when you come to analyse it, one is not so big, nor the other so small,
    after all; especially when you come to think that chaps can always wait,
    and business is only an inspiration in your mind, nine cases out of ten.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think of the trouble she takes to get you a good dinner, and how
    she keeps it hot between two plates in the oven, and waits hour after hour
    till the dinner gets dried up, and all her morning&rsquo;s work is wasted.
    Think how it hurts her, and how anxious she&rsquo;ll be (especially if you&rsquo;re
    inclined to booze) for fear that something has happened to you. You can&rsquo;t
    get it out of the heads of some young wives that you&rsquo;re liable to get
    run over, or knocked down, or assaulted, or robbed, or get into one of the
    fixes that a woman is likely to get into. But about the dinner waiting. Try
    and put yourself in her place. Wouldn&rsquo;t you get mad under the same
    circumstances? I know I would.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember once, only just after I was married, I was invited unexpectedly
    to a kidney pudding and beans&mdash;which was my favourite grub at the time&mdash; and
    I didn&rsquo;t resist, especially as it was washing day and I told the wife
    not to bother about anything for dinner. I got home an hour or so late, and
    had a good explanation thought out, when the wife met me with a smile as
    if we had just been left a thousand pounds. She&rsquo;d got her washing finished
    without assistance, though I&rsquo;d told her to get somebody to help her,
    and she had a kidney pudding and beans, with a lot of extras thrown in, as
    a pleasant surprise for me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I kissed her, and sat down, and stuffed till I thought every
    mouthful would choke me. I got through with it somehow, but I&rsquo;ve never
    cared for kidney pudding or beans since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell felt for his pipe with a fatherly smile in his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then again,&rdquo; he continued, as he cut up his tobacco, &ldquo;your
    wife might put on a new dress and fix herself up and look well, and you might
    think so and be satisfied with her appearance and be proud to take her out;
    but you want to tell her so, and tell her so as often as you think about
    it&mdash;and try to think a little oftener than men usually do, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have made a good husband, Jack,&rdquo; said his mate,
    in a softened tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, perhaps I should,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing up his
    tobacco; then he asked abstractedly: &ldquo;What sort of a husband did you
    make, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might have made a better one than I did,&rdquo; said Joe seriously,
    and rather bitterly, &ldquo;but I know one thing, I&rsquo;m going to try
    and make up for it when I go back this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We all say that,&rdquo; said Mitchell reflectively, filling his pipe. &ldquo;She
    loves you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know she does,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>Mitchell lit up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so would any man who knew her or had seen her letters to you,&rdquo; he
    said between the puffs. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s happy and contented enough, I
    believe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe, &ldquo;at least while I was there. She&rsquo;s
    never easy when I&rsquo;m away. I might have made her a good deal more happy
    and contented without hurting myself much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell smoked long, soft, measured puffs.</p>
  <p>His mate shifted uneasily and glanced at him a couple of times, and seemed
    to become impatient, and to make up his mind about something; or perhaps
    he got an idea that Mitchell had been &ldquo;having&rdquo; him, and felt
    angry over being betrayed into maudlin confidences; for he asked abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How is your wife now, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell calmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; echoed the mate. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
    treat her well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell removed his pipe and drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I tried to,&rdquo; he said wearily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, did you put your theory into practice?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Mitchell very deliberately.</p>
  <p>Joe waited, but nothing came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked impatiently, &ldquo;How did it act? Did it
    work well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Mitchell (puff); &ldquo;she left
    me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell jerked the half-smoked pipe from his mouth, and rapped the burning
    tobacco out against the toe of his boot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She left me,&rdquo; he said, standing up and stretching himself.
    Then, with a vicious jerk of his arm, &ldquo;She left me for&mdash;another
    kind of a fellow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked east towards the public-house, where they were taking the coach-horses
    from the stable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you finish your tea, Joe? The billy&rsquo;s getting
    cold.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellonWomen"></a>Mitchell on Women</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;All&nbsp;the same,&rdquo; said Mitchell&rsquo;s mate, continuing
    an argument by the camp-fire; &ldquo;all the same, I think that a woman can
    stand cold water better than a man. Why, when I was staying in a boarding-house
    in Dunedin, one very cold winter, there was a lady lodger who went down to
    the shower-bath first thing every morning; never missed one; sometimes went
    in freezing weather when I wouldn&rsquo;t go into a cold bath for a fiver;
    and sometimes she&rsquo;d stay under the shower for ten minutes at a time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, my room was near the bath-room, and I could hear the shower
    and tap going, and her floundering about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hear your grandmother!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell, contemptuously. &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t know women yet. Was this woman married? Did she have a husband
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; she was a young widow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! well, it would have been the same if she was a young girl&mdash; or
    an old one. Were there some passable men-boarders there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>I</i>&nbsp;was there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! But I mean, were there any there beside you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, there were three or four; there was&mdash;a clerk and a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, as long as there was something with trousers on. Did
    it ever strike you that she never got into the bath at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, no! What would she want to go there at all for, in that case?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To make an impression on the men,&rdquo;  replied Mitchell promptly. &ldquo;She
    wanted to make out she was nice, and wholesome, and well-washed, and particular.
    Made an impression on&nbsp;<i>you</i>, it seems, or you wouldn&rsquo;t remember
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, I suppose so; and, now I come to think of it, the bath
    didn&rsquo;t seem to injure her make-up or wet her hair; but I supposed she
    held her head from under the shower somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did she make-up so early in the morning?&rdquo;  asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s unusual; but it might have been so where there was a
    lot of boarders. And about the hair&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t count for anything,
    because washing-the-head ain&rsquo;t supposed to be always included in a
    lady&rsquo;s bath; it&rsquo;s only supposed to be washed once a fortnight,
    and some don&rsquo;t do it once a month. The hair takes so long to dry; it
    don&rsquo;t matter so much if the woman&rsquo;s got short, scraggy hair;
    but if a girl&rsquo;s hair was down to her waist it would take hours to dry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how do they manage it without wetting their heads?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s easy enough. They have a little oilskin cap that
    fits tight over the forehead, and they put it on, and bunch their hair up
    in it when they go under the shower. Did you ever see a woman sit in a sunny
    place with her hair down after having a wash?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I used to see one do that regular where I was staying; but I
    thought she only did it to show off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;she was drying her hair; though perhaps she was
    showing off at the same time, for she wouldn&rsquo;t sit where you&mdash;or
    even a Chinaman&mdash; could see her, if she didn&rsquo;t think she had a
    good head of hair. Now,&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;tell you a yarn about
    a woman&rsquo;s bath. I was stopping at a shabby-genteel boarding-house in
    Melbourne once, and one very cold winter, too; and there was a rather good-looking
    woman there, looking for a husband. She used to go down to the bath every
    morning, no matter how cold it was, and flounder and splash about as if she
    enjoyed it, till you&rsquo;d feel as though you&rsquo;d like to go and catch
    hold of her and wrap her in a rug and carry her in to the fire and nurse
    her till she was warm again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s mate moved uneasily, and crossed the other leg; he seemed
    greatly interested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But she never went into the water at all!&rdquo; continued Mitchell. &ldquo;As
    soon as one or two of the men was up in the morning she&rsquo;d come down
    from her room in a dressing-gown. It was a toney dressing-gown, too, and
    set her off properly. She knew how to dress, anyway; most of that sort of
    women do. The gown was a kind of green colour, with pink and white flowers
    all over it, and red lining, and a lot of coffee-coloured lace round the
    neck and down the front. Well, she&rsquo;d come tripping downstairs and along
    the passage, holding up one side of the gown to show her little bare white
    foot in a slipper; and in the other hand she carried her tooth-brush and
    bath-brush, and soap&mdash;like this&mdash;so&rsquo;s we all could see &rsquo;em;
    trying to make out she was too particular to use soap after anyone else.
    She could afford to buy her own soap, anyhow; it was hardly ever wet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;d go into the bathroom and turn on the tap and shower;
    when she got about three inches of water in the bath, she&rsquo;d step in,
    holding up her gown out of the water, and go slithering and kicking up and
    down the bath, like this, making a tremendous splashing. Of course she&rsquo;d
    turn off the shower first, and screw it off very tight&mdash; wouldn&rsquo;t
    do to let that leak, you know; she might get wet; but she&rsquo;d leave the
    other tap on, so as to make all the more noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But how did you come to know all about this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, the servant girl told me. One morning she twigged her through
    a corner of the bathroom window that the curtain didn&rsquo;t cover.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to have been pretty thick with servant girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do you with landladies! But never mind&mdash;let me finish the
    yarn. When she thought she&rsquo;d splashed enough, she&rsquo;d get out,
    wipe her feet, wash her face and hands, and carefully unbutton the two top
    buttons of her gown; then throw a towel over her head and shoulders, and
    listen at the door till she thought she heard some of the men moving about.
    Then she&rsquo;d start for her room, and, if she met one of the men-boarders
    in the passage or on the stairs, she&rsquo;d drop her eyes, and pretend to
    see for the first time that the top of her dressing-gown wasn&rsquo;t buttoned&mdash; and
    she&rsquo;d give a little start and grab the gown and scurry off to her room
    buttoning it up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And sometimes she&rsquo;d come skipping into the breakfast-room late,
    looking awfully sweet in her dressing-gown; and if she saw any of us there,
    she&rsquo;d pretend to be much startled, and say that she thought all the
    men had gone out, and make as though she was going to clear; and someone &lsquo;d
    jump up and give her a chair, while someone else said, &lsquo;Come in, Miss
    Brown! come in! Don&rsquo;t let us frighten you. Come right in, and have
    your breakfast before it gets cold.&rsquo; So she&rsquo;d flutter a bit in
    pretty confusion, and then make a sweet little girly-girly dive for her chair,
    and tuck her feet away under the table; and she&rsquo;d blush, too, but I
    don&rsquo;t know how she managed that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know another trick that women have; it&rsquo;s mostly played by
    private barmaids. That is, to leave a stocking by accident in the bathroom
    for the gentlemen to find. If the barmaid&rsquo;s got a nice foot and ankle,
    she uses one of her own stockings; but if she hasn&rsquo;t she gets hold
    of a stocking that belongs to a girl that has. Anyway, she&rsquo;ll have
    one readied up somehow. The stocking must be worn and nicely darned; one
    that&rsquo;s been worn will keep the shape of the leg and foot&mdash;at least
    till it&rsquo;s washed again. Well, the barmaid generally knows what time
    the gentlemen go to bath, and she&rsquo;ll make it a point of going down
    just as a gentleman&rsquo;s going. Of course he&rsquo;ll give her the preference&mdash;let
    her go first, you know&mdash; and she&rsquo;ll go in and accidentally leave
    the stocking in a place where he&rsquo;s sure to see it, and when she comes
    out he&rsquo;ll go in and find it; and very likely he&rsquo;ll be a jolly
    sort of fellow, and when they&rsquo;re all sitting down to breakfast he&rsquo;ll
    come in and ask them to guess what he&rsquo;s found, and then he&rsquo;ll
    hold up the stocking. The barmaid likes this sort of thing; but she&rsquo;ll
    hold down her head, and pretend to be confused, and keep her eyes on her
    plate, and there&rsquo;ll be much blushing and all that sort of thing, and
    perhaps she&rsquo;ll gammon to be mad at him, and the landlady&rsquo;ll say, &lsquo;Oh,
    Mr. Smith! how can yer? At the breakfast table, too!&rsquo; and they&rsquo;ll
    all laugh and look at the barmaid, and she&rsquo;ll get more embarrassed
    than ever, and spill her tea, and make out as though the stocking didn&rsquo;t
    belong to her.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="NoPlaceforaWoman"></a>No Place for a Woman</b></h2>
  <p>He had a selection on a long box-scrub siding of the ridges, about half
    a mile back and up from the coach road. There were no neighbours that I ever
    heard of, and the nearest &ldquo;town&rdquo; was thirty miles away. He grew
    wheat among the stumps of his clearing, sold the crop standing to a Cockie
    who lived ten miles away, and had some surplus sons; or, some seasons, he
    reaped it by hand, had it thrashed by travelling &ldquo;steamer&rdquo; (portable
    steam engine and machine), and carried the grain, a few bags at a time, into
    the mill on his rickety dray.</p>
  <p>He had lived alone for upwards of 15 years, and was known to those who knew
    him as &ldquo;Ratty Howlett&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Trav&rsquo;lers and strangers failed to see anything uncommonly ratty about
    him. It was known, or, at least, it was believed, without question, that
    while at work he kept his horse saddled and bridled, and hung up to the fence,
    or grazing about, with the saddle on&mdash;or, anyway, close handy for a
    moment&rsquo;s notice&mdash;and whenever he caught sight, over the scrub
    and through the quarter-mile break in it, of a traveller on the road, he
    would jump on his horse and make after him. If it was a horseman he usually
    pulled him up inside of a mile. Stories were told of unsuccessful chases,
    misunderstandings, and complications arising out of Howlett&rsquo;s mania
    for running down and bailing up travellers. Sometimes he caught one every
    day for a week, sometimes not one for weeks&mdash;it was a lonely track.</p>
  <p>The explanation was simple, sufficient, and perfectly natural&mdash;from
    a bushman&rsquo;s point of view. Ratty only wanted to have a yarn. He and
    the traveller would camp in the shade for half an hour or so and yarn and
    smoke. The old man would find out where the traveller came from, and how
    long he&rsquo;d been there, and where he was making for, and how long he
    reckoned he&rsquo;d be away; and ask if there had been any rain along the
    traveller&rsquo;s back track, and how the country looked after the drought;
    and he&rsquo;d get the traveller&rsquo;s ideas on abstract questions&mdash; if
    he had any. If it was a footman (swagman), and he was short of tobacco, old
    Howlett always had half a stick ready for him. Sometimes, but very rarely,
    he&rsquo;d invite the swagman back to the hut for a pint of tea, or a bit
    of meat, flour, tea, or sugar, to carry him along the track.</p>
  <p>And, after the yarn by the road, they said, the old man would ride back,
    refreshed, to his lonely selection, and work on into the night as long as
    he could see his solitary old plough horse, or the scoop of his long-handled
    shovel.</p>
  <p>And so it was that I came to make his acquaintance&mdash;or, rather, that
    he made mine. I was cantering easily along the track &mdash;I was making
    for the north-west with a pack horse&mdash;when about a mile beyond the track
    to the selection I heard, &ldquo;Hi, Mister!&rdquo; and saw a dust cloud
    following me. I had heard of &ldquo;Old Ratty Howlett&rdquo; casually, and
    so was prepared for him.</p>
  <p>A tall gaunt man on a little horse. He was clean-shaven, except for a frill
    beard round under his chin, and his long wavy, dark hair was turning grey;
    a square, strong-faced man, and reminded me of one full-faced portrait of
    Gladstone more than any other face I had seen. He had large reddish-brown
    eyes, deep set under heavy eyebrows, and with something of the blackfellow
    in them&mdash;the sort of eyes that will peer at something on the horizon
    that no one else can see. He had a way of talking to the horizon, too&mdash;more
    than to his companion; and he had a deep vertical wrinkle in his forehead
    that no smile could lessen.</p>
  <p>I got down and got out my pipe, and we sat on a log and yarned awhile on
    bush subjects; and then, after a pause, he shifted uneasily, it seemed to
    me, and asked rather abruptly, and in an altered tone, if I was married.
    A queer question to ask a traveller; more especially in my case, as I was
    little more than a boy then.</p>
  <p>He talked on again of old things and places where we had both been, and
    asked after men he knew, or had known&mdash;drovers and others&mdash;and
    whether they were living yet. Most of his inquiries went back before my time;
    but some of the drovers, one or two overlanders with whom he had been mates
    in his time, had grown old into mine, and I knew them. I notice now, though
    I didn&rsquo;t then&mdash;and if I had it would not have seemed strange from
    a bush point of view&mdash;that he didn&rsquo;t ask for news, nor seem interested
    in it.</p>
  <p>Then after another uneasy pause, during which he scratched crosses in the
    dust with a stick, he asked me, in the same queer tone and without looking
    at me or looking up, if I happened to know anything about doctoring&mdash;if
    I&rsquo;d ever studied it.</p>
  <p>I asked him if anyone was sick at his place. He hesitated, and said  &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then
    I wanted to know why he had asked me that question, and he was so long about
    answering that I began to think he was hard of hearing, when, at last, he
    muttered something about my face reminding him of a young fellow he knew
    of who&rsquo;d gone to Sydney to &ldquo;study for a doctor&rdquo;. That might
    have been, and looked natural enough; but why didn&rsquo;t he ask me straight
    out if I was the chap he &ldquo;knowed of&rdquo;? Travellers do not like
    beating about the bush in conversation.</p>
  <p>He sat in silence for a good while, with his arms folded, and looking absently
    away over the dead level of the great scrubs that spread from the foot of
    the ridge we were on to where a blue peak or two of a distant range showed
    above the bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>I stood up and put my pipe away and stretched. Then he seemed to wake up. &ldquo;Better
    come back to the hut and have a bit of dinner,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
    missus will about have it ready, and I&rsquo;ll spare you a handful of hay
    for the horses.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hay decided it. It was a dry season. I was surprised to hear of a wife,
    for I thought he was a hatter&mdash;I had always heard so; but perhaps I
    had been mistaken, and he had married lately; or had got a housekeeper. The
    farm was an irregularly-shaped clearing in the scrub, with a good many stumps
    in it, with a broken-down two-rail fence along the frontage, and logs and &ldquo;dog-leg&rdquo; the
    rest. It was about as lonely-looking a place as I had seen, and I had seen
    some out-of-the-way, God-forgotten holes where men lived alone. The hut was
    in the top corner, a two-roomed slab hut, with a shingle roof, which must
    have been uncommon round there in the days when that hut was built. I was
    used to bush carpentering, and saw that the place had been put up by a man
    who had plenty of life and hope in front of him, and for someone else beside
    himself. But there were two unfinished skilling rooms built on to the back
    of the hut; the posts, sleepers, and wall-plates had been well put up and
    fitted, and the slab walls were up, but the roof had never been put on. There
    was nothing but burrs and nettles inside those walls, and an old wooden bullock
    plough and a couple of yokes were dry-rotting across the back doorway. The
    remains of a straw-stack, some hay under a bark humpy, a small iron plough,
    and an old stiff coffin-headed grey draught horse, were all that I saw about
    the place.</p>
  <p>But there was a bit of a surprise for me inside, in the shape of a clean
    white tablecloth on the rough slab table which stood on stakes driven into
    the ground. The cloth was coarse, but it was a tablecloth &mdash;not a spare
    sheet put on in honour of unexpected visitors&mdash;and perfectly clean.
    The tin plates, pannikins, and jam tins that served as sugar bowls and salt
    cellars were polished brightly. The walls and fireplace were whitewashed,
    the clay floor swept, and clean sheets of newspaper laid on the slab mantleshelf
    under the row of biscuit tins that held the groceries. I thought that his
    wife, or housekeeper, or whatever she was, was a clean and tidy woman about
    a house. I saw no woman; but on the sofa &mdash;a light, wooden, batten one,
    with runged arms at the ends&mdash;lay a woman&rsquo;s dress on a lot of
    sheets of old stained and faded newspapers. He looked at it in a puzzled
    way, knitting his forehead, then took it up absently and folded it. I saw
    then that it was a riding skirt and jacket. He bundled them into the newspapers
    and took them into the bedroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wife was going on a visit down the creek this afternoon,&rdquo; he
    said rapidly and without looking at me, but stooping as if to have another
    look through the door at those distant peaks. &ldquo;I suppose she got tired
    o&rsquo; waitin&rsquo;, and went and took the daughter with her. But, never
    mind, the grub is ready.&rdquo; There was a camp-oven with a leg of mutton
    and potatoes sizzling in it on the hearth, and billies hanging over the fire.
    I noticed the billies had been scraped, and the lids polished.</p>
  <p>There seemed to be something queer about the whole business, but then he
    and his wife might have had a &ldquo;breeze&rdquo; during the morning. I
    thought so during the meal, when the subject of women came up, and he said
    one never knew how to take a woman, etc.; but there was nothing in what he
    said that need necessarily have referred to his wife or to any woman in particular.
    For the rest he talked of old bush things, droving, digging, and old bushranging&mdash;but
    never about live things and living men, unless any of the old mates he talked
    about happened to be alive by accident. He was very restless in the house,
    and never took his hat off.</p>
  <p>There was a dress and a woman&rsquo;s old hat hanging on the wall near the
    door, but they looked as if they might have been hanging there for a lifetime.
    There seemed something queer about the whole place&mdash;something wanting;
    but then all out-of-the-way bush homes are haunted by that something wanting,
    or, more likely, by the spirits of the things that should have been there,
    but never had been.</p>
  <p>As I rode down the track to the road I looked back and saw old Howlett hard
    at work in a hole round a big stump with his long-handled shovel.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d noticed that he moved and walked with a slight list to port, and
    put his hand once or twice to the small of his back, and I set it down to
    lumbago, or something of that sort.</p>
  <p>Up in the Never Never I heard from a drover who had known Howlett that his
    wife had died in the first year, and so this mysterious woman, if she was
    his wife, was, of course, his second wife. The drover seemed surprised and
    rather amused at the thought of old Howlett going in for matrimony again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I rode back that way five years later, from the Never Never. It was early
    in the morning&mdash;I had ridden since midnight. I didn&rsquo;t think the
    old man would be up and about; and, besides, I wanted to get on home, and
    have a look at the old folk, and the mates I&rsquo;d left behind&mdash;and
    the girl. But I hadn&rsquo;t got far past the point where Howlett&rsquo;s
    track joined the road, when I happened to look back, and saw him on horseback,
    stumbling down the track. I waited till he came up.</p>
  <p>He was riding the old grey draught horse this time, and it looked very much
    broken down. I thought it would have come down every step, and fallen like
    an old rotten humpy in a gust of wind. And the old man was not much better
    off. I saw at once that he was a very sick man. His face was drawn, and he
    bent forward as if he was hurt. He got down stiffly and awkwardly, like a
    hurt man, and as soon as his feet touched the ground he grabbed my arm, or
    he would have gone down like a man who steps off a train in motion. He hung
    towards the bank of the road, feeling blindly, as it were, for the ground,
    with his free hand, as I eased him down. I got my blanket and calico from
    the pack saddle to make him comfortable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Help me with my back agen the tree,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must
    sit up&mdash; it&rsquo;s no use lyin&rsquo; me down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat with his hand gripping his side, and breathed painfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall I run up to the hut and get the wife?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo; He spoke painfully. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; Then, as if the
    words were jerked out of him by a spasm: &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took it that she had left him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long have you been bad? How long has this been coming on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took no notice of the question. I thought it was a touch of rheumatic
    fever, or something of that sort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s gone into my back and
    sides now&mdash;the pain&rsquo;s worse in me back,&rdquo; he said presently.</p>
  <p>I had once been mates with a man who died suddenly of heart disease, while
    at work. He was washing a dish of dirt in the creek near a claim we were
    working; he let the dish slip into the water, fell back, crying, &ldquo;O,
    my back!&rdquo; and was gone. And now I felt by instinct that it was poor
    old Howlett&rsquo;s heart that was wrong. A man&rsquo;s heart is in his back
    as well as in his arms and hands.</p>
  <p>The old man had turned pale with the pallor of a man who turns faint in
    a heat wave, and his arms fell loosely, and his hands rocked helplessly with
    the knuckles in the dust. I felt myself turning white, too, and the sick,
    cold, empty feeling in my stomach, for I knew the signs. Bushmen stand in
    awe of sickness and death.</p>
  <p>But after I&rsquo;d fixed him comfortably and given him a drink from the
    water bag the greyness left his face, and he pulled himself together a bit;
    he drew up his arms and folded them across his chest. He let his head rest
    back against the tree&mdash;his slouch hat had fallen off revealing a broad,
    white brow, much higher than I expected. He seemed to gaze on the azure fin
    of the range, showing above the dark blue-green bush on the horizon.</p>
  <p>Then he commenced to speak&mdash;taking no notice of me when I asked him
    if he felt better now&mdash;to talk in that strange, absent, far-away tone
    that awes one. He told his story mechanically, monotonously&mdash;in set
    words, as I believe now, as he had often told it before; if not to others,
    then to the loneliness of the bush. And he used the names of people and places
    that I had never heard of&mdash;just as if I knew them as well as he did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to bring her up the first year. It was no place
    for a woman. I wanted her to stay with her people and wait till I&rsquo;d
    got the place a little more ship-shape. The Phippses took a selection down
    the creek. I wanted her to wait and come up with them so&rsquo;s she&rsquo;d
    have some company&mdash; a woman to talk to. They came afterwards, but they
    didn&rsquo;t stop. It was no place for a woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Mary would come. She wouldn&rsquo;t stop with her people down
    country. She wanted to be with me, and look after me, and work and help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He repeated himself a great deal&mdash;said the same thing over and over
    again sometimes. He was only mad on one track. He&rsquo;d tail off and sit
    silent for a while; then he&rsquo;d become aware of me in a hurried, half-scared
    way, and apologise for putting me to all that trouble, and thank me. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be all right d&rsquo;reckly. Best take the horses up to the hut and have
    some breakfast; you&rsquo;ll find it by the fire. I&rsquo;ll foller you,
    d&rsquo;reckly. The wife&rsquo;ll be waitin&rsquo; an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
    would drop off, and be going again presently on the old track:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her mother was coming up to stay awhile at the end of the year, but
    the old man hurt his leg. Then her married sister was coming, but one of
    the youngsters got sick and there was trouble at home. I saw the doctor in
    the town&mdash;thirty miles from here&mdash;and fixed it up with him. He
    was a boozer&mdash;I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him afterwards. I fixed up with
    a woman in the town to come and stay. I thought Mary was wrong in her time.
    She must have been a month or six weeks out. But I listened to her. . . .
    Don&rsquo;t argue with a woman. Don&rsquo;t listen to a woman. Do the right
    thing. We should have had a mother woman to talk to us. But it was no place
    for a woman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rocked his head, as if from some old agony of mind, against the tree-trunk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was took bad suddenly one night, but it passed off. False alarm.
    I was going to ride somewhere, but she said to wait till daylight. Someone
    was sure to pass. She was a brave and sensible girl, but she had a terror
    of being left alone. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a black shepherd three or four miles away. I rode over
    while Mary was asleep, and started the black boy into town. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    shot him afterwards if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a caught him. The old black gin was
    dead the week before, or Mary would a&rsquo; bin alright. She was tied up
    in a bunch with strips of blanket and greenhide, and put in a hole. So there
    wasn&rsquo;t even a gin near the place. It was no place for a woman!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was watchin&rsquo; the road at daylight, and I was watchin&rsquo; the
    road at dusk. I went down in the hollow and stooped down to get the gap agen
    the sky, so&rsquo;s I could see if anyone was comin&rsquo; over. . . . I&rsquo;d
    get on the horse and gallop along towards the town for five miles, but something
    would drag me back, and then I&rsquo;d race for fear she&rsquo;d die before
    I got to the hut. I expected the doctor every five minutes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It come on about daylight next morning. I ran back&rsquo;ards and
    for&rsquo;ards between the hut and the road like a madman. And no one come.
    I was running amongst the logs and stumps, and fallin&rsquo; over them, when
    I saw a cloud of dust agen sunrise. It was her mother an&rsquo; sister in
    the spring-cart, an&rsquo; just catchin&rsquo; up to them was the doctor
    in his buggy with the woman I&rsquo;d arranged with in town. The mother and
    sister was staying at the town for the night, when they heard of the black
    boy. It took him a day to ride there. I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a shot him if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a
    caught him ever after. The doctor&rsquo;d been on the drunk. If I&rsquo;d
    had the gun and known she was gone I&rsquo;d have shot him in the buggy.
    They said she was dead. And the child was dead, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They blamed me, but I didn&rsquo;t want her to come; it was no place
    for a woman. I never saw them again after the funeral. I didn&rsquo;t want
    to see them any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He moved his head wearily against the tree, and presently drifted on again
    in a softer tone&mdash;his eyes and voice were growing more absent and dreamy
    and far away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a month after&mdash;or a year, I lost count of the time long
    ago&mdash;she came back to me. At first she&rsquo;d come in the night, then
    sometimes when I was at work&mdash;and she had the baby&mdash;it was a girl&mdash;in
    her arms. And by-and-bye she came to stay altogether. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    blame her for going away that time&mdash;it was no place for a woman. . .
    . She was a good wife to me. She was a jolly girl when I married her. The
    little girl grew up like her. I was going to send her down country to be
    educated&mdash;it was no place for a girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But a month, or a year, ago, Mary left me, and took the daughter,
    and never came back till last night&mdash;this morning, I think it was. I
    thought at first it was the girl with her hair done up, and her mother&rsquo;s
    skirt on, to surprise her old dad. But it was Mary, my wife&mdash;as she
    was when I married her. She said she couldn&rsquo;t stay, but she&rsquo;d
    wait for me on the road; on&mdash;the road. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His arms fell, and his face went white. I got the water-bag. &ldquo;Another
    turn like that and you&rsquo;ll be gone,&rdquo; I thought, as he came to
    again. Then I suddenly thought of a shanty that had been started, when I
    came that way last, ten or twelve miles along the road, towards the town.
    There was nothing for it but to leave him and ride on for help, and a cart
    of some kind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wait here till I come back,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
    for the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He roused himself a little. &ldquo;Best come up to the hut and get some
    grub. The wife&rsquo;ll be waiting. . . .&rdquo; He was off the track again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you wait while I take the horse down to the creek?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the water-bag handy.
    Don&rsquo;t move till I come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t move&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait by the road,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I took the packhorse, which was the freshest and best, threw the pack-saddle
    and bags into a bush, left the other horse to take care of itself, and started
    for the shanty, leaving the old man with his back to the tree, his arms folded,
    and his eyes on the horizon.</p>
  <p>One of the chaps at the shanty rode on for the doctor at once, while the
    other came back with me in a spring-cart. He told me that old Howlett&rsquo;s
    wife had died in child-birth the first year on the selection&mdash;&ldquo;she
    was a fine girl he&rsquo;d heered!&rdquo; He told me the story as the old
    man had told it, and in pretty well the same words, even to giving it as
    his opinion that it was no place for a woman. &ldquo;And he &lsquo;hatted&rsquo; and
    brooded over it till he went ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I knew the rest. He not only thought that his wife, or the ghost of his
    wife, had been with him all those years, but that the child had lived and
    grown up, and that the wife did the housework; which, of course, he must
    have done himself.</p>
  <p>When we reached him his knotted hands had fallen for the last time, and
    they were at rest. I only took one quick look at his face, but could have
    sworn that he was gazing at the blue fin of the range on the horizon of the
    bush.</p>
  <p>Up at the hut the table was set as on the first day I saw it, and breakfast
    in the camp-oven by the fire.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellsJobs"></a>Mitchell&rsquo;s Jobs</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to knock off work and try to make some money,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, as he jerked the tea-leaves out of his pannikin and reached for
    the billy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been the great mistake of my life &mdash; if
    I hadn&rsquo;t wasted all my time and energy working and looking for work
    I might have been an independent man to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo; he added in a louder voice, condescendingly adapting
    his language to my bushed comprehension. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to sling
    graft and try and get some stuff together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t feel in a responsive humour, but I lit up and settled back
    comfortably against the tree, and Jack folded his arms on his knees and presently
    continued, reflectively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the first time I went to work. I was a youngster then.
    Mother used to go round looking for jobs for me. She reckoned, perhaps, that
    I was too shy to go in where there was a boy wanted and barrack for myself
    properly, and she used to help me and see me through to the best of her ability.
    I&rsquo;m afraid I didn&rsquo;t always feel as grateful to her as I should
    have felt. I was a thankless kid at the best of times &mdash; most kids are &mdash; but
    otherwise I was a straight enough little chap as nippers go. Sometimes I
    almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t been. My relations would have thought a good deal
    more of me and treated me better &mdash; and, besides, it&rsquo;s a comfort,
    at times, to sit and watch the sun going down in the bed of the bush, and
    think of your wicked childhood and wasted life, and the way you treated your
    parents and broke their hearts, and feel just properly repentant and bitter
    and remorseful and low-spirited about it when it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! . . . I generally did feel a bit backward in going in when
    I came to the door of an office or shop where there was a &lsquo;Strong Lad&rsquo;,
    or a &lsquo;Willing Youth&rsquo;, wanted inside to make himself generally
    useful. I was a strong lad and a willing youth enough, in some things, for
    that matter; but I didn&rsquo;t like to see it written up on a card in a
    shop window, and I didn&rsquo;t want to make myself generally useful in a
    close shop in a hot dusty street on mornings when the weather was fine and
    the great sunny rollers were coming in grand on the Bondi Beach and down
    at Coogee, and I could swim. . . . I&rsquo;d give something to be down along
    there now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked away out over the sultry sandy plain that we were to tackle
    next day, and sighed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first job I got was in a jam factory. They only had &lsquo;Boy
    Wanted&rsquo;  on the card in the window, and I thought it would suit me.
    They set me to work to peel peaches, and, as soon as the foreman&rsquo;s
    back was turned, I picked out a likely-looking peach and tried it. They soaked
    those peaches in salt or acid or something &mdash; it was part of the process &mdash; and
    I had to spit it out. Then I got an orange from a boy who was slicing them,
    but it was bitter, and I couldn&rsquo;t eat it. I saw that I&rsquo;d been
    had properly. I was in a fix, and had to get out of it the best way I could.
    I&rsquo;d left my coat down in the front shop, and the foreman and boss were
    there, so I had to work in that place for two mortal hours. It was about
    the longest two hours I&rsquo;d ever spent in my life. At last the foreman
    came up, and I told him I wanted to go down to the back for a minute. I slipped
    down, watched my chance till the boss&rsquo; back was turned, got my coat,
    and cleared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next job I got was in a mat factory; at least, Aunt got that
    for me. I didn&rsquo;t want to have anything to do with mats or carpets.
    The worst of it was the boss didn&rsquo;t seem to want me to go, and I had
    a job to get him to sack me, and when he did he saw some of my people and
    took me back again next week. He sacked me finally the next Saturday.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got the next job myself. I didn&rsquo;t hurry; I took my time and
    picked out a good one. It was in a lolly factory. I thought it would suit
    me &mdash; and it did, for a while. They put me on stirring up and mixing
    stuff in the jujube department; but I got so sick of the smell of it and
    so full of jujube and other lollies that I soon wanted a change; so I had
    a row with the chief of the jujube department and the boss gave me the sack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got a job in a grocery then. I thought I&rsquo;d have more variety
    there. But one day the boss was away, sick or something, all the afternoon,
    and I sold a lot of things too cheap. I didn&rsquo;t know. When a customer
    came in and asked for something I&rsquo;d just look round in the window till
    I saw a card with the price written up on it, and sell the best quality according
    to that price; and once or twice I made a mistake the other way about and
    lost a couple of good customers. It was a hot, drowsy afternoon, and by-and-bye
    I began to feel dull and sleepy. So I looked round the corner and saw a Chinaman
    coming. I got a big tin garden syringe and filled it full of brine from the
    butter keg, and, when he came opposite the door, I let him have the full
    force of it in the ear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Chinaman put down his baskets and came for me. I was strong
    for my age, and thought I could fight, but he gave me a proper mauling.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was like running up against a thrashing machine, and it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have been well for me if the boss of the shop next door hadn&rsquo;t interfered.
    He told my boss, and my boss gave me the sack at once.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I took a spell of eighteen months or so after that, and was growing
    up happy and contented when a married sister of mine must needs come to live
    in town and interfere. I didn&rsquo;t like married sisters, though I always
    got on grand with my brothers-in-law, and wished there were more of them.
    The married sister comes round and cleans up the place and pulls your things
    about and finds your pipe and tobacco and things, and cigarette portraits,
    and &ldquo;Deadwood Dicks&rdquo;, that you&rsquo;ve got put away all right,
    so&rsquo;s your mother and aunt wouldn&rsquo;t find them in a generation
    of cats, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother, why don&rsquo;t you make that boy go to work. It&rsquo;s
    a scandalous shame to see a big boy like that growing up idle. He&rsquo;s
    going to the bad before your eyes.&rsquo; And she&rsquo;s always trying to
    make out that you&rsquo;re a liar, and trying to make mother believe it,
    too. My married sister got me a job with a chemist, whose missus she knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got on pretty well there, and by-and-bye I was put upstairs in
    the grinding and mixing department; but, after a while, they put another
    boy that I was chummy with up there with me, and that was a mistake. I didn&rsquo;t
    think so at the time, but I can see it now. We got up to all sorts of tricks.
    We&rsquo;d get mixing together chemicals that weren&rsquo;t related to see
    how they&rsquo;d agree, and we nearly blew up the shop several times, and
    set it on fire once. But all the chaps liked us, and fixed things up for
    us. One day we got a big black dog &mdash; that we meant to take home that
    evening &mdash; and sneaked him upstairs and put him on a flat roof outside
    the laboratory. He had a touch of the mange and didn&rsquo;t look well, so
    we gave him a dose of something; and he scrambled over the parapet and slipped
    down a steep iron roof in front, and fell on a respected townsman that knew
    my people. We were awfully frightened, and didn&rsquo;t say anything. Nobody
    saw it but us. The dog had the presence of mind to leave at once, and the
    respected townsman was picked up and taken home in a cab; and he got it hot
    from his wife, too, I believe, for being in that drunken, beastly state in
    the main street in the middle of the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he was ever quite sure that he hadn&rsquo;t been
    drunk or what had happened, for he had had one or two that morning; so it
    didn&rsquo;t matter much. Only we lost the dog.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day I went downstairs to the packing-room and saw a lot of phosphorus
    in jars of water. I wanted to fix up a ghost for Billy, my mate, so I nicked
    a bit and slipped it into my trouser pocket.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I stood under the tap and let it pour on me. The phosphorus burnt
    clean through my pocket and fell on the ground. I was sent home that night
    with my leg dressed with lime-water and oil, and a pair of the boss&rsquo;s
    pants on that were about half a yard too long for me, and I felt miserable
    enough, too. They said it would stop my tricks for a while, and so it did.
    I&rsquo;ll carry the mark to my dying day &mdash; and for two or three days
    after, for that matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>I fell asleep at this point, and left Mitchell&rsquo;s cattle pup to hear
    it out.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BilltheVentriloquialRooster"></a>Bill, the Ventriloquial
      Rooster</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;When we were up country on the selection, we had a rooster at our
    place, named Bill,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;a big mongrel of no particular
    breed, though the old lady said he was a &lsquo;brammer&rsquo;&mdash;and
    many an argument she had with the old man about it too; she was just as stubborn
    and obstinate in her opinion as the governor was in his. But, anyway, we
    called him Bill, and didn&rsquo;t take any particular notice of him till
    a cousin of some of us came from Sydney on a visit to the country, and stayed
    at our place because it was cheaper than stopping at a pub. Well, somehow
    this chap got interested in Bill, and studied him for two or three days,
    and at last he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, that rooster&rsquo;s a ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;A ventriloquist!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go along with yer!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he is. I&rsquo;ve heard of cases like this before; but
    this is the first I&rsquo;ve come across. Bill&rsquo;s a ventriloquist right
    enough.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then we remembered that there wasn&rsquo;t another rooster within
    five miles  &mdash;our only neighbour, an Irishman named Page, didn&rsquo;t
    have one at the time&mdash; and we&rsquo;d often heard another cock crow,
    but didn&rsquo;t think to take any notice of it. We watched Bill, and sure
    enough he <i>was</i> a ventriloquist. The &lsquo;ka-cocka&rsquo; would come
    all right, but the &lsquo;co-ka-koo-oi-oo&rsquo; seemed to come from a distance.
    And sometimes the whole crow would go wrong, and come back like an echo that
    had been lost for a year. Bill would stand on tiptoe, and hold his elbows
    out, and curve his neck, and go two or three times as if he was swallowing
    nest-eggs, and nearly break his neck and burst his gizzard; and then there&rsquo;d
    be no sound at all where he was&mdash;only a cock crowing in the distance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And pretty soon we could see that Bill was in great trouble about
    it himself. You see, he didn&rsquo;t know it was himself&mdash;thought it
    was another rooster challenging him, and he wanted badly to find that other
    bird. He would get up on the wood-heap, and crow and listen&mdash;crow and
    listen again&mdash; crow and listen, and then he&rsquo;d go up to the top
    of the paddock, and get up on the stack, and crow and listen there. Then
    down to the other end of the paddock, and get up on a mullock-heap, and crow
    and listen there. Then across to the other side and up on a log among the
    saplings, and crow &lsquo;n&rsquo; listen some more. He searched all over
    the place for that other rooster, but, of course, couldn&rsquo;t find him.
    Sometimes he&rsquo;d be out all day crowing and listening all over the country,
    and then come home dead tired, and rest and cool off in a hole that the hens
    had scratched for him in a damp place under the water-cask sledge.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, one day Page brought home a big white rooster, and when he
    let it go it climbed up on Page&rsquo;s stack and crowed, to see if there
    was any more roosters round there. Bill had come home tired; it was a hot
    day, and he&rsquo;d rooted out the hens, and was having a spell-oh under
    the cask when the white rooster crowed. Bill didn&rsquo;t lose any time getting
    out and on to the wood-heap, and then he waited till he heard the crow again;
    then he crowed, and the other rooster crowed again, and they crowed at each
    other for three days, and called each other all the wretches they could lay
    their tongues to, and after that they implored each other to come out and
    be made into chicken soup and feather pillows. But neither&rsquo;d come.
    You see, there were <i>three</i> crows&mdash;there was Bill&rsquo;s crow,
    and the ventriloquist crow, and the white rooster&rsquo;s crow&mdash; and
    each rooster thought that there was <i>two</i> roosters in the opposition
    camp, and that he mightn&rsquo;t get fair play, and, consequently, both were
    afraid to put up their hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But at last Bill couldn&rsquo;t stand it any longer. He made up his
    mind to go and have it out, even if there was a whole agricultural show of
    prize and honourable-mention fighting-cocks in Page&rsquo;s yard. He got
    down from the wood-heap and started off across the ploughed field, his head
    down, his elbows out, and his thick awkward legs prodding away at the furrows
    behind for all they were worth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to go down badly and see the fight, and barrack for Bill.
    But I daren&rsquo;t, because I&rsquo;d been coming up the road late the night
    before with my brother Joe, and there was about three panels of turkeys roosting
    along on the top rail of Page&rsquo;s front fence; and we brushed &rsquo;em
    with a bough, and they got up such a blessed gobbling fuss about it that
    Page came out in his shirt and saw us running away; and I knew he was laying
    for us with a bullock whip. Besides, there was friction between the two families
    on account of a thoroughbred bull that Page borrowed and wouldn&rsquo;t lend
    to us, and that got into our paddock on account of me mending a panel in
    the party fence, and carelessly leaving the top rail down after sundown while
    our cows was moving round there in the saplings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there was too much friction for me to go down, but I climbed a
    tree as near the fence as I could and watched. Bill reckoned he&rsquo;d found
    that rooster at last. The white rooster wouldn&rsquo;t come down from the
    stack, so Bill went up to him, and they fought there till they tumbled down
    the other side, and I couldn&rsquo;t see any more. Wasn&rsquo;t I wild? I&rsquo;d
    have given my dog to have seen the rest of the fight. I went down to the
    far side of Page&rsquo;s fence and climbed a tree there, but, of course,
    I couldn&rsquo;t see anything, so I came home the back way. Just as I got
    home Page came round to the front and sung out, &lsquo;Insoid there!&rsquo; And
    me and Jim went under the house like snakes and looked out round a pile.
    But Page was all right&mdash;he had a broad grin on his face, and Bill safe
    under his arm. He put Bill down on the ground very carefully, and says he
    to the old folks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yer rooster knocked the stuffin&rsquo; out of my rooster,
    but I bear no malice. &rsquo;Twas a grand foight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then the old man and Page had a yarn, and got pretty friendly
    after that. And Bill didn&rsquo;t seem to bother about any more ventriloquism;
    but the white rooster spent a lot of time looking for that other rooster.
    Perhaps he thought he&rsquo;d have better luck with him. But Page was on
    the look-out all the time to get a rooster that would lick ours. He did nothing
    else for a month but ride round and enquire about roosters; and at last he
    borrowed a game-bird in town, left five pounds deposit on him, and brought
    him home. And Page and the old man agreed to have a match&mdash; about the
    only thing they&rsquo;d agreed about for five years. And they fixed it up
    for a Sunday when the old lady and the girls and kids were going on a visit
    to some relations, about fifteen miles away&mdash; to stop all night. The
    guv&rsquo;nor made me go with them on horseback; but I knew what was up,
    and so my pony went lame about a mile along the road, and I had to come back
    and turn him out in the top paddock, and hide the saddle and bridle in a
    hollow log, and sneak home and climb up on the roof of the shed. It was a
    awful hot day, and I had to keep climbing backward and forward over the ridge-pole
    all the morning to keep out of sight of the old man, for he was moving about
    a good deal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, after dinner, the fellows from roundabout began to ride in
    and hang up their horses round the place till it looked as if there was going
    to be a funeral. Some of the chaps saw me, of course, but I tipped them the
    wink, and they gave me the office whenever the old man happened around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Page came along with his game-rooster. Its name was Jim. It
    wasn&rsquo;t much to look at, and it seemed a good deal smaller and weaker
    than Bill. Some of the chaps were disgusted, and said it wasn&rsquo;t a game-rooster
    at all; Bill&rsquo;d settle it in one lick, and they wouldn&rsquo;t have
    any fun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, they brought the game one out and put him down near the wood-heap,
    and rousted Bill out from under his cask. He got interested at once. He looked
    at Jim, and got up on the wood-heap and crowed and looked at Jim again. He
    reckoned <i>this</i> at last was the fowl that had been humbugging him all
    along. Presently his trouble caught him, and then he&rsquo;d crow and take
    a squint at the game &rsquo;un, and crow again, and have another squint at
    gamey, and try to crow and keep his eye on the game-rooster at the same time.
    But Jim never committed himself, until at last he happened to gape just after
    Bill&rsquo;s whole crow went wrong, and Bill spotted him. He reckoned he&rsquo;d
    caught him this time, and he got down off that wood-heap and went for the
    foe. But Jim ran away&mdash;and Bill ran after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Round and round the wood-heap they went, and round the shed, and
    round the house and under it, and back again, and round the wood-heap and
    over it and round the other way, and kept it up for close on an hour. Bill&rsquo;s
    bill was just within an inch or so of the game-rooster&rsquo;s tail feathers
    most of the time, but he couldn&rsquo;t get any nearer, do how he liked.
    And all the time the fellers kept chyackin Page and singing out, &lsquo;What
    price yer game &rsquo;un, Page! Go it, Bill! Go it, old cock!&rsquo;  and
    all that sort of thing. Well, the game-rooster went as if it was a go-as-you-please,
    and he didn&rsquo;t care if it lasted a year. He didn&rsquo;t seem to take
    any interest in the business, but Bill got excited, and by-and-by he got
    mad. He held his head lower and lower and his wings further and further out
    from his sides, and prodded away harder and harder at the ground behind,
    but it wasn&rsquo;t any use. Jim seemed to keep ahead without trying. They
    stuck to the wood-heap towards the last. They went round first one way for
    a while, and then the other for a change, and now and then they&rsquo;d go
    over the top to break the monotony; and the chaps got more interested in
    the race than they would have been in the fight&mdash;and bet on it, too.
    But Bill was handicapped with his weight. He was done up at last; he slowed
    down till he couldn&rsquo;t waddle, and then, when he was thoroughly knocked
    up, that game-rooster turned on him, and gave him the father of a hiding.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And my father caught me when I&rsquo;d got down in the excitement,
    and wasn&rsquo;t thinking, and <i>he</i> gave <i>me</i> the step-father of
    a hiding. But he had a lively time with the old lady afterwards, over the
    cock-fight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bill was so disgusted with himself that he went under the cask and
    died.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BushCats"></a>Bush Cats</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Domestic cats&rdquo; we mean&mdash;the descendants of cats who came
    from the northern world during the last hundred odd years. We do not know
    the name of the vessel in which the first Thomas and his Maria came out to
    Australia, but we suppose that it was one of the ships of the First Fleet.
    Most likely Maria had kittens on the voyage &mdash;two lots, perhaps&mdash;the
    majority of which were buried at sea; and no doubt the disembarkation caused
    her much maternal anxiety.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The feline race has not altered much in Australia, from a physical point
    of view&mdash;not yet. The rabbit has developed into something like a cross
    between a kangaroo and a possum, but the bush has not begun to develop the
    common cat. She is just as sedate and motherly as the mummy cats of Egypt
    were, but she takes longer strolls of nights, climbs gum-trees instead of
    roofs, and hunts stranger vermin than ever came under the observation of
    her northern ancestors. Her views have widened. She is mostly thinner than
    the English farm cat&mdash; which is, they say, on account of eating lizards.</p>
  <p>English rats and English mice&mdash;we say &ldquo;English&rdquo; because
    everything which isn&rsquo;t Australian in Australia, <i>is</i> English (or
    British)&mdash; English rats and English mice are either rare or non-existent
    in the bush; but the hut cat has a wider range for game. She is always dragging
    in things which are unknown in the halls of zoology; ugly, loathsome, crawling
    abortions which have not been classified yet&mdash;and perhaps could not
    be.</p>
  <p>The Australian zoologist ought to rake up some more dead languages, and
    then go Out Back with a few bush cats.</p>
  <p>The Australian bush cat has a nasty, unpleasant habit of dragging a long,
    wriggling, horrid, black snake&mdash;she seems to prefer black snakes&mdash;into
    a room where there are ladies, proudly laying it down in a conspicuous place
    (usually in front of the exit), and then looking up for approbation. She
    wonders, perhaps, why the visitors are in such a hurry to leave.</p>
  <p>Pussy doesn&rsquo;t approve of live snakes round the place, especially if
    she has kittens; and if she finds a snake in the vicinity of her progeny&mdash; well,
    it is bad for that particular serpent.</p>
  <p>This brings recollections of a neighbour&rsquo;s cat who went out in the
    scrub, one midsummer&rsquo;s day, and found a brown snake. Her name &mdash;the
    cat&rsquo;s name&mdash;was Mary Ann. She got hold of the snake all right,
    just within an inch of its head; but it got the rest of its length wound
    round her body and squeezed about eight lives out of her. She had the presence
    of mind to keep her hold; but it struck her that she was in a fix, and that
    if she wanted to save her ninth life, it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to
    go home for help. So she started home, snake and all.</p>
  <p>The family were at dinner when Mary Ann came in, and, although she stood
    on an open part of the floor, no one noticed her for a while. She couldn&rsquo;t
    ask for help, for her mouth was too full of snake. By-and-bye one of the
    girls glanced round, and then went over the table, with a shriek, and out
    of the back door. The room was cleared very quickly. The eldest boy got a
    long-handled shovel, and in another second would have killed more cat than
    snake; but his father interfered. The father was a shearer, and Mary Ann
    was a favourite cat with him. He got a pair of shears from the shelf and
    deftly shore off the snake&rsquo;s head, and one side of Mary Ann&rsquo;s
    whiskers. She didn&rsquo;t think it safe to let go yet. She kept her teeth
    in the neck until the selector snipped the rest of the snake off her. The
    bits were carried out on a shovel to die at sundown. Mary Ann had a good
    drink of milk, and then got her tongue out and licked herself back into the
    proper shape for a cat; after which she went out to look for that snake&rsquo;s
    mate. She found it, too, and dragged it home the same evening.</p>
  <p>Cats will kill rabbits and drag them home. We knew a fossicker whose cat
    used to bring him a bunny nearly every night. The fossicker had rabbits for
    breakfast until he got sick of them, and then he used to swap them with a
    butcher for meat. The cat was named Ingersoll, which indicates his sex and
    gives an inkling to his master&rsquo;s religious and political opinions.
    Ingersoll used to prospect round in the gloaming until he found some rabbit
    holes which showed encouraging indications. He would shepherd one hole for
    an hour or so every evening until he found it was a duffer, or worked it
    out; then he would shift to another. One day he prospected a big hollow log
    with a lot of holes in it, and more going down underneath. The indications
    were very good, but Ingersoll had no luck. The game had too many ways of
    getting out and in. He found that he could not work that claim by himself,
    so he floated it into a company. He persuaded several cats from a neighbouring
    selection to take shares, and they watched the holes together, or in turns&mdash;they
    worked shifts. The dividends more than realised even their wildest expectations,
    for each cat took home at least one rabbit every night for a week.</p>
  <p>A selector started a vegetable garden about the time when rabbits were beginning
    to get troublesome up country. The hare had not shown itself yet. The farmer
    kept quite a regiment of cats to protect his garden&mdash;and they protected
    it. He would shut the cats up all day with nothing to eat, and let them out
    about sundown; then they would mooch off to the turnip patch like farm-labourers
    going to work. They would drag the rabbits home to the back door, and sit
    there and watch them until the farmer opened the door and served out the
    ration of milk. Then the cats would turn in. He nearly always found a semi-circle
    of dead rabbits and watchful cats round the door in the morning. They sold
    the product of their labour direct to the farmer for milk. It didn&rsquo;t
    matter if one cat had been unlucky &mdash;had not got a rabbit&mdash;each
    had an equal share in the general result. They were true socialists, those
    cats.</p>
  <p>One of those cats was a mighty big Tom, named Jack. He was death on rabbits;
    he would work hard all night, laying for them and dragging them home. Some
    weeks he would graft every night, and at other times every other night, but
    he was generally pretty regular. When he reckoned he had done an extra night&rsquo;s
    work, he would take the next night off and go three miles to the nearest
    neighbour&rsquo;s to see his Maria and take her out for a stroll. Well, one
    evening Jack went into the garden and chose a place where there was good
    cover, and lay low. He was a bit earlier than usual, so he thought he would
    have a doze till rabbit time. By-and-bye he heard a noise, and slowly, cautiously
    opening one eye, he saw two big ears sticking out of the leaves in front
    of him. He judged that it was an extra big bunny, so he put some extra style
    into his manoeuvres. In about five minutes he made his spring. He must have
    thought (if cats think) that it was a whopping, old-man rabbit, for it was
    a pioneer hare&mdash;not an ordinary English hare, but one of those great
    coarse, lanky things which the bush is breeding. The selector was attracted
    by an unusual commotion and a cloud of dust among his cabbages, and came
    along with his gun in time to witness the fight. First Jack would drag the
    hare, and then the hare would drag Jack; sometimes they would be down together,
    and then Jack would use his hind claws with effect; finally he got his teeth
    in the right place, and triumphed. Then he started to drag the corpse home,
    but he had to give it best and ask his master to lend a hand. The selector
    took up the hare, and Jack followed home, much to the family&rsquo;s surprise.
    He did not go back to work that night; he took a spell. He had a drink of
    milk, licked the dust off himself, washed it down with another drink, and
    sat in front of the fire and thought for a goodish while. Then he got up,
    walked over to the corner where the hare was lying, had a good look at it,
    came back to the fire, sat down again, and thought hard. He was still thinking
    when the family retired.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MeetingOldMates"></a>Meeting Old Mates</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I<br>
    Tom Smith</b></h3>
  <p>You are getting well on in the thirties, and haven&rsquo;t left off being
    a fool yet. You have been away in another colony or country for a year or
    so, and have now come back again. Most of your chums have gone away or got
    married, or, worse still, signed the pledge&mdash; settled down and got steady;
    and you feel lonely and desolate and left-behind enough for anything. While
    drifting aimlessly round town with an eye out for some chance acquaintance
    to have a knock round with, you run against an old chum whom you never dreamt
    of meeting, or whom you thought to be in some other part of the country&mdash; or
    perhaps you knock up against someone who knows the old chum in question,
    and he says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you know Tom Smith&rsquo;s in Sydney?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom Smith! Why, I thought he was in Queensland! I haven&rsquo;t seen
    him for more than three years. Where&rsquo;s the old joker hanging out at
    all? Why, except you, there&rsquo;s no one in Australia I&rsquo;d sooner
    see than Tom Smith. Here I&rsquo;ve been mooning round like an unemployed
    for three weeks, looking for someone to have a knock round with, and Tom
    in Sydney all the time. I wish I&rsquo;d known before. Where&rsquo;ll I run
    against him&mdash; where does he live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s living at home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But where&rsquo;s his home? I was never there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll give you his address. . . . There, I think that&rsquo;s
    it. I&rsquo;m not sure about the number, but you&rsquo;ll soon find out in
    that street&mdash; most of &rsquo;em&rsquo;ll know Tom Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks! I rather think they will. I&rsquo;m glad I met you. I&rsquo;ll
    hunt Tom up to-day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So you put a few shillings in your pocket, tell your landlady that you&rsquo;re
    going to visit an old aunt of yours or a sick friend, and mayn&rsquo;t be
    home that night; and then you start out to hunt up Tom Smith and have at
    least one more good night, if you die for it.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>This is the first time you have seen Tom at home; you knew of his home and
    people in the old days, but only in a vague, indefinite sort of way. Tom
    has changed! He is stouter and older-looking; he seems solemn and settled
    down. You intended to give him a surprise and have a good old jolly laugh
    with him, but somehow things get suddenly damped at the beginning. He grins
    and grips your hand right enough, but there seems something wanting. You
    can&rsquo;t help staring at him, and he seems to look at you in a strange,
    disappointing way; it doesn&rsquo;t strike you that you also have changed,
    and perhaps more in his eyes than he in yours. He introduces you to his mother
    and sisters and brothers, and the rest of the family; or to his wife, as
    the case may be; and you have to suppress your feelings and be polite and
    talk common-place. You hate to be polite and talk common-place. You aren&rsquo;t
    built that way&mdash; and Tom wasn&rsquo;t either, in the old days. The wife
    (or the mother and sisters) receives you kindly, for Tom&rsquo;s sake, and
    makes much of you; but they don&rsquo;t know you yet. You want to get Tom
    outside, and have a yarn and a drink and a laugh with him&mdash;you are bursting
    to tell him all about yourself, and get him to tell you all about himself,
    and ask him if he remembers things; and you wonder if he is bursting the
    same way, and hope he is. The old lady and sisters (or the wife) bore you
    pretty soon, and you wonder if they bore Tom; you almost fancy, from his
    looks, that they do. You wonder whether Tom is coming out to-night, whether
    he wants to get out, and if he wants to and wants to get out by himself,
    whether he&rsquo;ll be able to manage it; but you daren&rsquo;t broach the
    subject, it wouldn&rsquo;t be polite. You&rsquo;ve got to be polite. Then
    you get worried by the thought that Tom is bursting to get out with you and
    only wants an excuse; is waiting, in fact, and hoping for you to ask him
    in an off-hand sort of way to come out for a stroll. But you&rsquo;re not
    quite sure; and besides, if you were, you wouldn&rsquo;t have the courage.
    By-and-bye you get tired of it all, thirsty, and want to get out in the open
    air. You get tired of saying,  &ldquo;Do you really, Mrs. Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Do
    you think so, Miss Smith?&rdquo; or &ldquo;You were quite right, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Well,
    I think so too, Mrs. Smith,&rdquo; or, to the brother,  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    just what I thought, Mr. Smith.&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t want to &ldquo;talk
    pretty&rdquo; to them, and listen to their wishy-washy nonsense; you want
    to get out and have a roaring spree with Tom, as you had in the old days;
    you want to make another night of it with your old mate, Tom Smith; and pretty
    soon you get the blues badly, and feel nearly smothered in there, and you&rsquo;ve
    got to get out and have a beer anyway&mdash;Tom or no Tom; and you begin
    to feel wild with Tom himself; and at last you make a bold dash for it and
    chance Tom. You get up, look at your hat, and say: &ldquo;Ah, well, I must
    be going, Tom; I&rsquo;ve got to meet someone down the street at seven o&rsquo;clock.
    Where&rsquo;ll I meet you in town next week?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Tom says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, dash it; you ain&rsquo;t going yet. Stay to tea, Joe, stay to
    tea. It&rsquo;ll be on the table in a minute. Sit down&mdash;sit down, man!
    Here, gimme your hat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Tom&rsquo;s sister, or wife, or mother comes in with an apron on and
    her hands all over flour, and says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re not going yet, Mr. Brown? Tea&rsquo;ll be ready
    in a minute. Do stay for tea.&rdquo; And if you make excuses, she cross-examines
    you about the time you&rsquo;ve got to keep that appointment down the street,
    and tells you that their clock is twenty minutes fast, and that you have
    got plenty of time, and so you have to give in. But you are mightily encouraged
    by a winksome expression which you see, or fancy you see, on your side of
    Tom&rsquo;s face; also by the fact of his having accidentally knocked his
    foot against your shins. So you stay.</p>
  <p>One of the females tells you to &ldquo;Sit there, Mr. Brown,&rdquo; and
    you take your place at the table, and the polite business goes on. You&rsquo;ve
    got to hold your knife and fork properly, and mind your p&rsquo;s and q&rsquo;s,
    and when she says, &ldquo;Do you take milk and sugar, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve
    got to say, &ldquo;Yes, please, Miss Smith&mdash;thanks&mdash;that&rsquo;s
    plenty.&rdquo; And when they press you, as they will, to have more, you&rsquo;ve
    got to keep on saying, &ldquo;No, thanks, Mrs. Smith; no, thanks, Miss Smith;
    I really couldn&rsquo;t; I&rsquo;ve done very well, thank you; I had a very
    late dinner, and so on&rdquo;&mdash;bother such tommy-rot. And you don&rsquo;t
    seem to have any appetite, anyway. And you think of the days out on the track
    when you and Tom sat on your swags under a mulga at mid-day, and ate mutton
    and johnny-cake with clasp-knives, and drank by turns out of the old, battered,
    leaky billy.</p>
  <p>And after tea you have to sit still while the precious minutes are wasted,
    and listen and sympathize, while all the time you are on the fidget to get
    out with Tom, and go down to a private bar where you know some girls.</p>
  <p>And perhaps by-and-bye the old lady gets confidential, and seizes an opportunity
    to tell you what a good steady young fellow Tom is now that he never touches
    drink, and belongs to a temperance society (or the Y.M.C.A.), and never stays
    out of nights.</p>
  <p>Consequently you feel worse than ever, and lonelier, and sorrier that you
    wasted your time coming. You are encouraged again by a glimpse of Tom putting
    on a clean collar and fixing himself up a bit; but when you are ready to
    go, and ask him if he&rsquo;s coming a bit down the street with you, he says
    he thinks he will in such a disinterested, don&rsquo;t-mind-if-I-do sort
    of tone, that he makes you mad.</p>
  <p>At last, after promising to &ldquo;drop in again, Mr. Brown, whenever you&rsquo;re
    passing,&rdquo; and to &ldquo;don&rsquo;t forget to call,&rdquo; and thanking
    them for their assurance that they&rsquo;ll &ldquo;be always glad to see
    you,&rdquo; and telling them that you&rsquo;ve spent a very pleasant evening
    and enjoyed yourself, and are awfully sorry you couldn&rsquo;t stay&mdash;you
    get away with Tom.</p>
  <p>You don&rsquo;t say much to each other till you get round the corner and
    down the street a bit, and then for a while your conversation is mostly common-place,
    such as, &ldquo;Well, how have you been getting on all this time, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    all right. How have you been getting on?&rdquo; and so on.</p>
  <p>But presently, and perhaps just as you have made up your mind to chance
    the alleged temperance business and ask Tom in to have a drink, he throws
    a glance up and down the street, nudges your shoulder, says &ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; and
    disappears sideways into a pub.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Tom?&rdquo; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours, Joe?&rdquo; &ldquo;The
    same for me.&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s luck, old man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s
    luck.&rdquo; You take a drink, and look over your glass at Tom. Then the
    old smile spreads over his face, and it makes you glad&mdash;you could swear
    to Tom&rsquo;s grin in a hundred years. Then something tickles him&mdash;your
    expression, perhaps, or a recollection of the past&mdash;and he sets down
    his glass on the bar and laughs. Then you laugh. Oh, there&rsquo;s no smile
    like the smile that old mates favour each other with over the tops of their
    glasses when they meet again after years. It is eloquent, because of the
    memories that give it birth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s another. Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;? Do you remember&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; Oh,
    it all comes back again like a flash. Tom hasn&rsquo;t changed a bit; just
    the same good-hearted, jolly idiot he always was. Old times back again! &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just like old times,&rdquo; says Tom, after three or four more drinks.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>And so you make a night of it and get uproariously jolly. You get as  &ldquo;glorious&rdquo; as
    Bobby Burns did in the part of Tam O&rsquo;Shanter, and have a better &ldquo;time&rdquo;  than
    any of the times you had in the old days. And you see Tom as nearly home
    in the morning as you dare, and he reckons he&rsquo;ll get it hot from his
    people&mdash;which no doubt he will&mdash; and he explains that they are
    very particular up at home &mdash;church people, you know&mdash;and, of course,
    especially if he&rsquo;s married, it&rsquo;s understood between you that
    you&rsquo;d better not call for him up at home after this&mdash;at least,
    not till things have cooled down a bit. It&rsquo;s always the way. The friend
    of the husband always gets the blame in cases like this. But Tom fixes up
    a yarn to tell them, and you aren&rsquo;t to &ldquo;say anything different&rdquo; in
    case you run against any of them. And he fixes up an appointment with you
    for next Saturday night, and he&rsquo;ll get there if he gets divorced for
    it. But he <i>might</i> have to take the wife out shopping, or one of the
    girls somewhere; and if you see her with him you&rsquo;ve got to lay low,
    and be careful, and wait &mdash;at another hour and place, perhaps, all of
    which is arranged&mdash;  for if she sees you she&rsquo;ll smell a rat at
    once, and he won&rsquo;t be able to get off at all.</p>
  <p>And so, as far as you and Tom are concerned, the &ldquo;old times&rdquo; have
    come back once more.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But, of course (and we almost forgot it), you might chance to fall in love
    with one of Tom&rsquo;s sisters, in which case there would be another and
    a totally different story to tell.</p>

  <p>Things are going well with you. You have escaped from &ldquo;the track&rdquo;,
    so to speak, and are in a snug, comfortable little billet in the city. Well,
    while doing the block you run against an old mate of other days&mdash;<i>very</i> other
    days&mdash;call him Jack Ellis. Things have gone hard with Jack. He knows
    you at once, but makes no advance towards a greeting; he acts as though he
    thinks you might cut him&mdash;which, of course, if you are a true mate,
    you have not the slightest intention of doing. His coat is yellow and frayed,
    his hat is battered and green, his trousers &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  in various
    places, his linen very cloudy, and his boots burst and innocent of polish.
    You try not to notice these things &mdash;or rather, not to seem to notice
    them&mdash;but you cannot help doing so, and you are afraid he&rsquo;ll notice
    that you see these things, and put a wrong construction on it. How men will
    misunderstand each other! You greet him with more than the necessary enthusiasm.
    In your anxiety to set him at his ease and make him believe that nothing&mdash;not
    even money&mdash;can make a difference in your friendship, you over-act the
    business; and presently you are afraid that he&rsquo;ll notice that too,
    and put a wrong construction on it. You wish that your collar was not so
    clean, nor your clothes so new. Had you known you would meet him, you would
    have put on some old clothes for the occasion.</p>
  <p>You are both embarrassed, but it is <i>you</i> who feel ashamed&mdash; you
    are almost afraid to look at him lest he&rsquo;ll think you are looking at
    his shabbiness. You ask him in to have a drink, but he doesn&rsquo;t respond
    so heartily as you wish, as he did in the old days; he doesn&rsquo;t like
    drinking with anybody when he isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;fixed&rdquo;, as he calls
    it&mdash; when he can&rsquo;t shout.</p>
  <p>It didn&rsquo;t matter in the old days who held the money so long as there
    was plenty of &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; in the camp. You think of the days when
    Jack stuck to you through thick and thin. You would like to give him money
    now, but he is so proud; he always was; he makes you mad with his beastly
    pride. There wasn&rsquo;t any pride of that sort on the track or in the camp
    in those days; but times have changed&mdash;your lives have drifted too widely
    apart&mdash; you have taken different tracks since then; and Jack, without
    intending to, makes you feel that it is so.</p>
  <p>You have a drink, but it isn&rsquo;t a success; it falls flat, as far as
    Jack is concerned; he won&rsquo;t have another; he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;feel
    on&rdquo;, and presently he escapes under plea of an engagement, and promises
    to see you again.</p>
  <p>And you wish that the time was come when no one could have more or less
    to spend than another.</p>
  <p>P.S.&mdash;I met an old mate of that description once, and so successfully
    persuaded him out of his beastly pride that he borrowed two pounds off me
    till Monday. I never got it back since, and I want it badly at the present
    time. In future I&rsquo;ll leave old mates with their pride unimpaired.</p>

  <p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;orter do something, Ernie. Yer know how I am. <i>You</i> don&rsquo;t
    seem to care. Y&rsquo;orter to do something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher slouched at a greater angle to the greasy door-post, and scowled
    under his hat-brim. It was a little, low, frowsy room opening into Jones&rsquo; Alley.
    She sat at the table, sewing&mdash;a thin, sallow girl with weak, colourless
    eyes. She looked as frowsy as her surroundings.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you go to some of them women, and get fixed
    up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She flicked the end of the table-cloth over some tiny, unfinished articles
    of clothing, and bent to her work.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you know very well I haven&rsquo;t got a shilling, Ernie,&rdquo; she
    said, quietly. &ldquo;Where am I to get the money from?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who asked yer to get it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was silent, with the exasperating silence of a woman who has determined
    to do a thing in spite of all reasons and arguments that may be brought against
    it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, wot more do yer want?&rdquo; demanded Stowsher, impatiently.</p>
  <p>She bent lower. &ldquo;Couldn't we keep it, Ernie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot next?&rdquo; asked Stowsher, sulkily&mdash;he had half suspected
    what was coming. Then, with an impatient oath, &ldquo;You must be gettin&rsquo; ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She brushed the corner of the cloth further over the little clothes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t cost anything, Ernie. I&rsquo;d take a pride in
    him, and keep him clean, and dress him like a little lord. He&rsquo;ll be
    different from all the other youngsters. He wouldn&rsquo;t be like those
    dirty, sickly little brats out there. He&rsquo;d be just like you, Ernie;
    I know he would. I&rsquo;ll look after him night and day, and bring him up
    well and strong. We&rsquo;d train his little muscles from the first, Ernie,
    and he&rsquo;d be able to knock &rsquo;em all out when he grew up. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    cost much, and I&rsquo;d work hard and be careful if you&rsquo;d help me.
    And you&rsquo;d be proud of him, too, Ernie&mdash;I know you would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher scraped the doorstep with his foot; but whether he was &ldquo;touched&rdquo;,
    or feared hysterics and was wisely silent, was not apparent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you remember the first day I met you, Ernie?&rdquo; she asked,
    presently.</p>
  <p>Stowsher regarded her with an uneasy scowl: &ldquo;Well&mdash;wot o&rsquo; that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You came into the bar-parlour at the &lsquo;Cricketers&rsquo; Arms&rsquo; and
    caught a push of &rsquo;em chyacking your old man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I altered that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you did. You done for three of them, one after another, and
    two was bigger than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes! and when the push come up we done for the rest,&rdquo; said
    Stowsher, softening at the recollection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the day you come home and caught the landlord bullying your old
    mother like a dog&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; I got three months for that job. But it was worth it!&rdquo; he
    reflected.  &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the old woman might have
    had the knocker to keep away from the lush while I was in quod. . . . But
    wot&rsquo;s all this got to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>He</i> might barrack and fight for you, some day, Ernie,&rdquo; she
    said softly, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;re old and out of form and ain&rsquo;t
    got no push to back you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The thing was becoming decidedly embarrassing to Stowsher; not that he felt
    any delicacy on the subject, but because he hated to be drawn into a conversation
    that might be considered &ldquo;soft&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, stow that!&rdquo; he said, comfortingly. &ldquo;Git on yer hat,
    and I&rsquo;ll take yer for a trot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She rose quickly, but restrained herself, recollecting that it was not good
    policy to betray eagerness in response to an invitation from Ernie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;you know&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to go out like this.
    You can&rsquo;t&mdash; you wouldn&rsquo;t like to take me out the way I am,
    Ernie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not? Wot rot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The fellows would see me, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And . . . wot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They might notice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, wot o&rsquo; that? I want &rsquo;em to. Are yer comin&rsquo; or
    are yer ain&rsquo;t? Fling round now. I can&rsquo;t hang on here all day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They walked towards Flagstaff Hill.</p>
  <p>One or two, slouching round a pub. corner, saluted with &ldquo;Wotcher,
    Stowsher!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not too stinkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; replied Stowsher. &ldquo;Soak yer
    heads.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stowsher&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; to stick,&rdquo; said one privately.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; so he orter,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Wish I had the
    chanst.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two turned up a steep lane.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t walk so fast up hill, Ernie; I can&rsquo;t, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Liz. I forgot that. Why didn&rsquo;t yer say so before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She was contentedly silent most of the way, warned by instinct, after the
    manner of women when they have gained their point by words.</p>
  <p>Once he glanced over his shoulder with a short laugh. &ldquo;Gorblime!&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I nearly thought the little beggar was a-follerin&rsquo; along
    behind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he left her at the door he said: &ldquo;Look here, Liz. &rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s
    half a quid. Git what yer want. Let her go. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to graft
    again in the mornin&rsquo;, and I&rsquo;ll come round and see yer to-morrer
    night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still she seemed troubled and uneasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ernie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well. Wot now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;posin&rsquo; it's a girl, Ernie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Stowsher flung himself round impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, stow that! Yer always singin&rsquo; out
    before yer hurt. . . . There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; else, ain&rsquo;t there&mdash;while
    the bloomin&rsquo; shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Ernie. Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me? . . . I&rsquo;m satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Satisfied! Yer don&rsquo;t want the kid to be arst &rsquo;oo &rsquo;is
    father was, do yer? Yer&rsquo;d better come along with me some day this week
    and git spliced. Yer don&rsquo;t want to go frettin&rsquo; or any of that
    funny business while it&rsquo;s on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Ernie! do you really mean it?&rdquo;&mdash;and she threw her
    arms round his neck, and broke down at last.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So-long, Liz. No more funny business now&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had enough
    of it. Keep yer pecker up, old girl. To-morrer night, mind.&rdquo; Then he
    added suddenly: &ldquo;Yer might have known I ain&rsquo;t that sort of a
    bloke&rdquo; &mdash;and left abruptly.</p>
  <p>Liz was very happy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MrSmellingscheck"></a>Mr. Smellingscheck</b></h2>
  <p>I met him in a sixpenny restaurant&mdash;&ldquo;All meals, 6d.&mdash;Good
    beds, 1s.&rdquo; That was before sixpenny restaurants rose to a third-class
    position, and became possibly respectable places to live in, through the
    establishment, beneath them, of fourpenny hash-houses (good beds, 6d.), and,
    beneath <i>them</i> again, of <i>three</i>-penny  &ldquo;dining-rooms&mdash;<i>clean</i> beds,
    4d.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were five beds in our apartment, the head of one against the foot
    of the next, and so on round the room, with a space where the door and washstand
    were. I chose the bed the head of which was near the foot of his, because
    he looked like a man who took his bath regularly. I should like, in the interests
    of sentiment, to describe the place as a miserable, filthy, evil-smelling
    garret; but I can&rsquo;t&mdash;because it wasn&rsquo;t. The room was large
    and airy; the floor was scrubbed and the windows cleaned at least once a
    week, and the beds kept fresh and neat, which is more&mdash;a good deal more&mdash; than
    can be said of many genteel private boarding-houses. The lodgers were mostly
    respectable unemployed, and one or two&mdash;fortunate men!&mdash; in work;
    it was the casual boozer, the professional loafer, and the occasional spieler&mdash;the
    one-shilling-bed-men&mdash;  who made the place objectionable, not the hard-working
    people who paid ten pounds a week for the house; and, but for the one-night
    lodgers and the big gilt black-and-red bordered and &ldquo;shaded&rdquo; &ldquo;6d.&rdquo; in
    the window &mdash;which made me glance guiltily up and down the street, like
    a burglar about to do a job, before I went in&mdash;I was pretty comfortable
    there.</p>
  <p>They called him &ldquo;Mr. Smellingscheck&rdquo;, and treated him with a
    peculiar kind of deference, the reason for which they themselves were doubtless
    unable to explain or even understand. The haggard woman who made the beds
    called him &ldquo;Mr. Smell-&rsquo;is-check&rdquo;. Poor fellow! I didn&rsquo;t
    think, by the look of him, that he&rsquo;d smelt his cheque, or anyone else&rsquo;s,
    or that anyone else had smelt his, for many a long day. He was a fat man,
    slow and placid. He looked like a typical monopolist who had unaccountably
    got into a suit of clothes belonging to a Domain unemployed, and hadn&rsquo;t
    noticed, or had entirely forgotten, the circumstance in his business cares&mdash;if
    such a word as care could be connected with such a calm, self-contained nature.
    He wore a suit of cheap slops of some kind of shoddy &ldquo;tweed&rdquo;.
    The coat was too small and the trousers too short, and they were drawn up
    to meet the waistcoat&mdash;which they did with painful difficulty, now and
    then showing, by way of protest, two pairs of brass buttons and the ends
    of the brace-straps; and they seemed to blame the irresponsive waistcoat
    or the wearer for it all. Yet he never gave way to assist them. A pair of
    burst elastic-sides were in full evidence, and a rim of cloudy sock, with
    a hole in it, showed at every step.</p>
  <p>But he put on his clothes and wore them like&mdash;like a gentleman. He
    had two white shirts, and they were both dirty. He&rsquo;d lay them out on
    the bed, turn them over, regard them thoughtfully, choose that which appeared
    to his calm understanding to be the cleaner, and put it on, and wear it until
    it was unmistakably dirtier than the other; then he&rsquo;d wear the other
    till it was dirtier than the first. He managed his three collars the same
    way. His handkerchiefs were washed in the bathroom, and dried, without the
    slightest disguise, in the bedroom. He never hurried in anything. The way
    he cleaned his teeth, shaved, and made his toilet almost transformed the
    place, in my imagination, into a gentleman&rsquo;s dressing-room.</p>
  <p>He talked politics and such things in the abstract&mdash;always in the abstract  &mdash;calmly
    in the abstract. He was an old-fashioned Conservative of the Sir Leicester
    Deadlock style. When he was moved by an extra shower of aggressive democratic
    cant&mdash;which was seldom&mdash; he defended Capital, but only as if it
    needed no defence, and as if its opponents were merely thoughtless, ignorant
    children whom he condescended to set right because of their inexperience
    and for their own good. He stuck calmly to his own order&mdash;the order
    which had dropped him like a foul thing when the bottom dropped out of his
    boom, whatever that was. He never talked of his misfortunes.</p>
  <p>He took his meals at the little greasy table in the dark corner downstairs,
    just as if he were dining at the Exchange. He had a chop&mdash;rather well-done&mdash;and
    a sheet of the <i>Herald</i> for breakfast. He carried two handkerchiefs;
    he used one for a handkerchief and the other for a table-napkin, and sometimes
    folded it absently and laid it on the table. He rose slowly, putting his
    chair back, took down his battered old green hat, and regarded it thoughtfully&mdash;as
    though it had just occurred to him in a calm, casual way that he&rsquo;d
    drop into his hatter&rsquo;s, if he had time, on his way down town, and get
    it blocked, or else send the messenger round with it during business hours.
    He&rsquo;d draw his stick out from behind the next chair, plant it, and,
    if you hadn&rsquo;t quite finished your side of the conversation, stand politely
    waiting until you were done. Then he&rsquo;d look for a suitable reply into
    his hat, put it on, give it a twitch to settle it on his head&mdash;as gentlemen
    do a &ldquo;chimney-pot&rdquo;&mdash;step out into the gangway, turn his
    face to the door, and walk slowly out on to the middle of the pavement&mdash; looking
    more placidly well-to-do than ever. The saying is that clothes make a man,
    but <i>he</i> made his almost respectable just by wearing them. Then he&rsquo;d
    consult his watch&mdash;(he stuck to the watch all through, and it seemed
    a good one&mdash;I often wondered why he didn&rsquo;t pawn it); then he&rsquo;d
    turn slowly, right turn, and look down the street. Then slowly back, left-about
    turn, and take a cool survey in that direction, as if calmly undecided whether
    to take a cab and drive to the Exchange, or (as it was a very fine morning,
    and he had half an hour to spare) walk there and drop in at his club on the
    way. He&rsquo;d conclude to walk. I never saw him go anywhere in particular,
    but he walked and stood as if he could.</p>
  <p>Coming quietly into the room one day, I surprised him sitting at the table
    with his arms lying on it and his face resting on them. I heard something
    like a sob. He rose hastily, and gathered up some papers which were on the
    table; then he turned round, rubbing his forehead and eyes with his forefinger
    and thumb, and told me that he suffered from&mdash;something, I forget the
    name of it, but it was a well-to-do ailment. His manner seemed a bit jolted
    and hurried for a minute or so, and then he was himself again. He told me
    he was leaving for Melbourne next day. He left while I was out, and left
    an envelope downstairs for me. There was nothing in it except a pound note.</p>
  <p>I saw him in Brisbane afterwards, well-dressed, getting out of a cab at
    the entrance of one of the leading hotels. But his manner was no more self-contained
    and well-to-do than it had been in the old sixpenny days&mdash;because it
    couldn&rsquo;t be. We had a well-to-do whisky together, and he talked of
    things in the abstract. He seemed just as if he&rsquo;d met me in the Australia.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ARoughShed"></a>&ldquo;A Rough Shed&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>A hot, breathless, blinding sunrise&mdash;the sun having appeared suddenly
    above the ragged edge of the barren scrub like a great disc of molten steel.
    No hint of a morning breeze before it, no sign on earth or sky to show that
    it is morning&mdash;save the position of the sun.</p>
  <p>A clearing in the scrub&mdash;bare as though the surface of the earth were
    ploughed and harrowed, and dusty as the road. Two oblong huts &mdash;one
    for the shearers and one for the rouseabouts&mdash; in about the centre of
    the clearing (as if even the mongrel scrub had shrunk away from them) built
    end-to-end, of weatherboards, and roofed with galvanised iron. Little ventilation;
    no verandah; no attempt to create, artificially, a breath of air through
    the buildings. Unpainted, sordid&mdash;hideous. Outside, heaps of ashes still
    hot and smoking. Close at hand, &ldquo;butcher&rsquo;s shop&rdquo;&mdash;a
    bush and bag breakwind in the dust, under a couple of sheets of iron, with
    offal, grease and clotted blood blackening the surface of the ground about
    it. Greasy, stinking sheepskins hanging everywhere with blood-blotched sides
    out. Grease inches deep in great black patches about the fireplace ends of
    the huts, where wash-up and &ldquo;boiling&rdquo; water is thrown.</p>
  <p>Inside, a rough table on supports driven into the black, greasy ground floor,
    and formed of flooring boards, running on uneven lines the length of the
    hut from within about 6ft. of the fire-place. Lengths of single six-inch
    boards or slabs on each side, supported by the projecting ends of short pieces
    of timber nailed across the legs of the table to serve as seats.</p>
  <p>On each side of the hut runs a rough framework, like the partitions in a
    stable; each compartment battened off to about the size of a manger, and
    containing four bunks, one above the other, on each side&mdash; their ends,
    of course, to the table. Scarcely breathing space anywhere between. Fireplace,
    the full width of the hut in one end, where all the cooking and baking for
    forty or fifty men is done, and where flour, sugar, etc., are kept in open
    bags. Fire, like a very furnace. Buckets of tea and coffee on roasting beds
    of coals and ashes on the hearth. Pile of &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;  on the bare
    black boards at the end of the table. Unspeakable aroma of forty or fifty
    men who have little inclination and less opportunity to wash their skins,
    and who soak some of the grease out of their clothes &mdash;in buckets of
    hot water&mdash;on Saturday afternoons or Sundays. And clinging to all, and
    over all, the smell of the dried, stale yolk of wool &mdash;the stink of
    rams!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am a rouseabout of the rouseabouts. I have fallen so far that it
    is beneath me to try to climb to the proud position of &lsquo;ringer&rsquo; of
    the shed. I had that ambition once, when I was the softest of green hands;
    but then I thought I could work out my salvation and go home. I&rsquo;ve
    got used to hell since then. I only get twenty-five shillings a week (less
    station store charges) and tucker here. I have been seven years west of the
    Darling and never shore a sheep. Why don&rsquo;t I learn to shear, and so
    make money? What should I do with more money? Get out of this and go home?
    I would never go home unless I had enough money to keep me for the rest of
    my life, and I&rsquo;ll never make that Out Back. Otherwise, what should
    I do at home? And how should I account for the seven years, if I were to
    go home? Could I describe shed life to them and explain how I lived. They
    think shearing only takes a few days of the year&mdash;at the beginning of
    summer. They&rsquo;d want to know how I lived the rest of the year. Could
    I explain that I &lsquo;jabbed trotters&rsquo; and was a &lsquo;tea-and-sugar
    burglar&rsquo; between sheds. They&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d been a tramp and
    a beggar all the time. Could I explain <i>anything</i> so that they&rsquo;d
    understand? I&rsquo;d have to be lying all the time and would soon be tripped
    up and found out. For, whatever else I have been I was never much of a liar.
    No, I&rsquo;ll never go home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I become momentarily conscious about daylight. The flies on the track
    got me into that habit, I think; they start at day-break&mdash; when the
    mosquitoes give over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook rings a bullock bell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The cook is fire-proof. He is as a fiend from the nethermost sheol
    and needs to be. No man sees him sleep, for he makes bread &mdash;or worse,
    brownie&mdash;at night, and he rings a bullock bell loudly at half-past five
    in the morning to rouse us from our animal torpors. Others, the sheep-ho&rsquo;s
    or the engine-drivers at the shed or wool-wash, call him, if he does sleep.
    They manage it in shifts, somehow, and sleep somewhere, sometime. We haven&rsquo;t
    time to know. The cook rings the bullock bell and yells the time. It was
    the same time five minutes ago&mdash;or a year ago. No time to decide which.
    I dash water over my head and face and slap handfuls on my eyelids &mdash;gummed
    over aching eyes&mdash;still blighted by the yolk o&rsquo; wool&mdash; grey,
    greasy-feeling water from a cut-down kerosene tin which I sneaked from the
    cook and hid under my bunk and had the foresight to refill from the cask
    last night, under cover of warm, still, suffocating darkness. Or was it the
    night before last? Anyhow, it will be sneaked from me to-day, and from the
    crawler who will collar it to-morrow, and &lsquo;touched&rsquo;  and &lsquo;lifted&rsquo; and &lsquo;collared&rsquo; and
    recovered by the cook, and sneaked back again, and cause foul language, and
    fights, maybe, till we &lsquo;cut-out&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; we didn&rsquo;t have sweet dreams of home and mother, gentle
    poet&mdash; nor yet of babbling brooks and sweethearts, and love&rsquo;s
    young dream. We are too dirty and dog-tired when we tumble down, and have
    too little time to sleep it off. We don&rsquo;t want to dream those dreams
    out here&mdash; they&rsquo;d only be nightmares for us, and we&rsquo;d wake
    to remember. We <i>mustn&rsquo;t</i> remember here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the edge of the timber a great galvanised-iron shed, nearly all
    roof, coming down to within 6ft. 6in. of the &lsquo;board&rsquo; over the &lsquo;shoots&rsquo;.
    Cloud of red dust in the dead timber behind, going up&mdash;noon-day dust.
    Fence covered with skins; carcases being burned; blue smoke going straight
    up as in noonday. Great glossy (greasy-glossy) black crows &lsquo;flopping&rsquo; around.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first syren has gone. We hurry in single files from opposite
    ends of rouseabouts&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts (as the paths happen
    to run to the shed) gulping hot tea or coffee from a pint-pot in one hand
    and biting at a junk of brownie in the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shed of forty hands. Shearers rush the pens and yank out sheep and
    throw them like demons; grip them with their knees, take up machines, jerk
    the strings; and with a rattling whirring roar the great machine-shed starts
    for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go it, you &mdash;&mdash; tigers!&rsquo; yells a tar-boy. &lsquo;Wool
    away!&rsquo; &lsquo;Tar!&rsquo; &lsquo;Sheep Ho!&rsquo; We rush through with
    a whirring roar till breakfast time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We seize our tin plate from the pile, knife and fork from the candle-box,
    and crowd round the camp-oven to jab out lean chops, dry as chips, boiled
    in fat. Chops or curry-and-rice. There is some growling and cursing. We slip
    into our places without removing our hats. There&rsquo;s no time to hunt
    for mislaid hats when the whistle goes. Row of hat brims, level, drawn over
    eyes, or thrust back&mdash;according to characters or temperaments. Thrust
    back denotes a lucky absence of brains, I fancy. Row of forks going up, or
    jabbing, or poised, loaded, waiting for last mouthful to be bolted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We pick up, sweep, tar, sew wounds, catch sheep that break from the
    pens, jump down and pick up those that can&rsquo;t rise at the bottom of
    the shoots, &lsquo;bring-my-combs-from-the-grinder-will-yer,&rsquo;  laugh
    at dirty jokes, and swear&mdash;and, in short, are the &lsquo;will-yer&rsquo; slaves,
    body and soul, of seven, six, five, or four shearers, according to the distance
    from the rolling tables.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The shearer on the board at the shed is a demon. He gets so much
    a hundred; we, 25s. a week. He is not supposed, by the rules of the shed,
    the Union, and humanity, to take a sheep out of the pen <i>after</i> the
    bell goes (smoke-ho, meals, or knock-off), but his watch is hanging on the
    post, and he times himself to get so many sheep out of the pen <i>before</i> the
    bell goes, and <i>one more</i>&mdash;the  &lsquo;bell-sheep&rsquo;&mdash;as
    it is ringing. We have to take the last fleece to the table and leave our
    board clean. We go through the day of eight hours in runs of about an hour
    and 20 minutes between smoke-ho&rsquo;s&mdash;from 6 to 6. If the shearers
    shore 200 instead of 100, they&rsquo;d get 2 Pounds a day instead of 1 Pound,
    and we&rsquo;d have twice as much work to do for our 25s. per week. But the
    shearers are racing each other for tallies. And it&rsquo;s no use kicking.
    There is no God here and no Unionism (though we all have tickets). But what
    am I growling about? I&rsquo;ve worked from 6 to 6 with no smoke-ho&rsquo;s
    for half the wages, and food we wouldn&rsquo;t give the sheep-ho dog. It&rsquo;s
    the bush growl, born of heat, flies, and dust. I&rsquo;d growl now if I had
    a thousand a year. We <i>must</i> growl, swear, and some of us drink to d.t.&rsquo;s,
    or go mad sober.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pants and shirts stiff with grease as though a couple of pounds of
    soft black putty were spread on with a painter&rsquo;s knife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, gentle bard!&mdash;we don&rsquo;t sing at our work. Over the
    whirr and roar and hum all day long, and with iteration that is childish
    and irritating to the intelligent greenhand, float unthinkable adjectives
    and adverbs, addressed to jumbucks, jackaroos, and mates indiscriminately.
    And worse words for the boss over the board&mdash;behind his back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came of a Good Christian Family&mdash;perhaps that&rsquo;s why
    I went to the Devil. When I came out here I&rsquo;d shrink from the man who
    used foul language. In a short time I used it with the worst. I couldn&rsquo;t
    help it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it. If I went back to a woman&rsquo;s country
    again I wouldn&rsquo;t swear. I&rsquo;d forget this as I would a nightmare.
    That&rsquo;s the way of it. There&rsquo;s something of the larrikin about
    us. We don&rsquo;t exist individually. Off the board, away from the shed
    (and each other) we are quiet&mdash;even gentle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A great-horned ram, in poor condition, but shorn of a heavy fleece,
    picks himself up at the foot of the &lsquo;shoot&rsquo;, and hesitates, as
    if ashamed to go down to the other end where the ewes are. The most ridiculous
    object under Heaven.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tar-boy of fifteen, of the bush, with a mouth so vile that a street-boy,
    same age (up with a shearing uncle), kicks him behind&mdash;having proved
    his superiority with his fists before the shed started. Of which unspeakable
    little fiend the roughest shearer of a rough shed was heard to say, in effect,
    that if he thought there was the slightest possibility of his becoming the
    father of such a boy he&rsquo;d&mdash;&mdash;take drastic measures to prevent
    the possibility of his becoming a proud parent at all.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twice a day the cooks and their familiars carry buckets of oatmeal-water
    and tea to the shed, two each on a yoke. We cry, &lsquo;Where are you coming
    to, my pretty maids?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In ten minutes the surfaces of the buckets are black with flies.
    We have given over trying to keep them clear. We stir the living cream aside
    with the bottoms of the pints, and guzzle gallons, and sweat it out again.
    Occasionally a shearer pauses and throws the perspiration from his forehead
    in a rain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shearers live in such a greedy rush of excitement that often a strong
    man will, at a prick of the shears, fall in a death-like faint on the board.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hate the Boss-of-the-Board as the shearers&rsquo; &lsquo;slushy&rsquo; hates
    the shearers&rsquo; cook. I don&rsquo;t know why. He&rsquo;s a very fair
    boss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He refused to put on a traveller yesterday, and the traveller knocked
    him down. He walked into the shed this morning with his hat back and thumbs
    in waistcoat&mdash;a tribute to man&rsquo;s weakness. He threatened to dismiss
    the traveller&rsquo;s mate, a bigger man, for rough shearing&mdash;a tribute
    to man&rsquo;s strength. The shearer said nothing. We hate the boss because
    he <i>is</i> boss, but we respect him because he is a strong man. He is as
    hard up as any of us, I hear, and has a sick wife and a large, small family
    in Melbourne. God judge us all!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is a gambling-school here, headed by the shearers&rsquo; cook.
    After tea they head-&rsquo;em, and advance cheques are passed from hand to
    hand, and thrown in the dust until they are black. When it&rsquo;s too dark
    to see with nose to the ground, they go inside and gamble with cards. Sometimes
    they start on Saturday afternoon, heading &rsquo;em till dark, play cards
    all night, start again heading &rsquo;em Sunday afternoon, play cards all
    Sunday night, and sleep themselves sane on Monday, or go to work ghastly&mdash;like
    dead men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cry of &lsquo;Fight&rsquo;; we all rush out. But there isn&rsquo;t
    much fighting. Afraid of murdering each other. I&rsquo;m beginning to think
    that most bush crime is due to irritation born of dust, heat, and flies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The smothering atmosphere shudders when the sun goes down. We call
    it the sunset breeze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saturday night or Sunday we&rsquo;re invited into the shearers&rsquo; hut.
    There are songs that are not hymns and recitations and speeches that are
    not prayers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Last Sunday night: Slush lamps at long intervals on table. Men playing
    cards, sewing on patches&mdash;(nearly all smoking)&mdash; some writing,
    and the rest reading Deadwood Dick. At one end of the table a Christian Endeavourer
    endeavouring; at the other a cockney Jew, from the hawker&rsquo;s boat, trying
    to sell rotten clothes. In response to complaints, direct and not chosen
    generally for Sunday, the shearers&rsquo;  rep. requests both apostles to
    shut up or leave.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t be expected to take the Christian and leave the
    Jew, any more than he could take the Jew and leave the Christian. We are
    just amongst ourselves in our hell.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fiddle at the end of rouseabouts&rsquo; hut. Voice of Jackeroo, from
    upper bunk with apologetic oaths: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake chuck that
    up; it makes a man think of blanky old things!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A lost soul laughs (mine) and dreadful night smothers us.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="PayableGold"></a>Payable Gold</b></h2>
  <p>Among the crowds who left the Victorian side for New South Wales about the
    time Gulgong broke out was an old Ballarat digger named Peter McKenzie. He
    had married and retired from the mining some years previously and had made
    a home for himself and family at the village of St. Kilda, near Melbourne;
    but, as was often the case with old diggers, the gold fever never left him,
    and when the fields of New South Wales began to blaze he mortgaged his little
    property in order to raise funds for another campaign, leaving sufficient
    behind him to keep his wife and family in comfort for a year or so.</p>
  <p>As he often remarked, his position was now very different from what it had
    been in the old days when he first arrived from Scotland, in the height of
    the excitement following on the great discovery. He was a young man then
    with only himself to look out for, but now that he was getting old and had
    a family to provide for he had staked too much on this venture to lose. His
    position did certainly look like a forlorn hope, but he never seemed to think
    so.</p>
  <p>Peter must have been very lonely and low-spirited at times. A young or unmarried
    man can form new ties, and even make new sweethearts if necessary, but Peter&rsquo;s
    heart was with his wife and little ones at home, and they were mortgaged,
    as it were, to Dame Fortune. Peter had to lift this mortgage off.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless he was always cheerful, even at the worst of times, and his
    straight grey beard and scrubby brown hair encircled a smile which appeared
    to be a fixture. He had to make an effort in order to look grave, such as
    some men do when they want to force a smile.</p>
  <p>It was rumoured that Peter had made a vow never to return home until he
    could take sufficient wealth to make his all-important family comfortable,
    or, at least, to raise the mortgage from the property, for the sacrifice
    of which to his mad gold fever he never forgave himself. But this was one
    of the few things which Peter kept to himself.</p>
  <p>The fact that he had a wife and children at St. Kilda was well known to
    all the diggers. They had to know it, and if they did not know the age, complexion,
    history and peculiarities of every child and of the &ldquo;old woman&rdquo; it
    was not Peter&rsquo;s fault.</p>
  <p>He would cross over to our place and talk to the mother for hours about
    his wife and children. And nothing pleased him better than to discover peculiarities
    in us children wherein we resembled his own. It pleased us also for mercenary
    reasons.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the same with my old woman,&rdquo; or &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    just the same with my youngsters,&rdquo;  Peter would exclaim boisterously,
    for he looked upon any little similarity between the two families as a remarkable
    coincidence. He liked us all, and was always very kind to us, often standing
    between our backs and the rod that spoils the child&mdash;that is, I mean,
    if it isn&rsquo;t used. I was very short-tempered, but this failing was more
    than condoned by the fact that Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;eldest&rdquo; was given
    that way also. Mother&rsquo;s second son was very good-natured; so was Peter&rsquo;s
    third. Her &ldquo;third&rdquo; had a great aversion for any duty that threatened
    to increase his muscles; so had Peter&rsquo;s &ldquo;second&rdquo;. Our baby
    was very fat and heavy and was given to sucking her own thumb vigorously,
    and, according to the latest bulletins from home, it was just the same with
    Peter&rsquo;s  &ldquo;last&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>I think we knew more about Peter&rsquo;s family than we did about our own.
    Although we had never seen them, we were as familiar with their features
    as the photographer&rsquo;s art could make us, and always knew their domestic
    history up to the date of the last mail.</p>
  <p>We became interested in the McKenzie family. Instead of getting bored by
    them as some people were, we were always as much pleased when Peter got a
    letter from home as he was himself, and if a mail were missed, which seldom
    happened&mdash;we almost shared his disappointment and anxiety. Should one
    of the youngsters be ill, we would be quite uneasy, on Peter&rsquo;s account,
    until the arrival of a later bulletin removed his anxiety, and ours.</p>
  <p>It must have been the glorious power of a big true heart that gained for
    Peter the goodwill and sympathy of all who knew him.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s smile had a peculiar fascination for us children. We would
    stand by his pointing forge when he&rsquo;d be sharpening picks in the early
    morning, and watch his face for five minutes at a time, wondering sometimes
    whether he was always <i>smiling inside</i>, or whether the smile went on
    externally irrespective of any variation in Peter&rsquo;s condition of mind.</p>
  <p>I think it was the latter case, for often when he had received bad news
    from home we have heard his voice quaver with anxiety, while the old smile
    played on his round, brown features just the same.</p>
  <p>Little Nelse (one of those queer old-man children who seem to come into
    the world by mistake, and who seldom stay long) used to say that Peter &ldquo;cried
    inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Once, on Gulgong, when he attended the funeral of an old Ballarat mate,
    a stranger who had been watching his face curiously remarked that McKenzie
    seemed as pleased as though the dead digger had bequeathed him a fortune.
    But the stranger had soon reason to alter his opinion, for when another old
    mate began in a tremulous voice to repeat the words &ldquo;Ashes to ashes,
    an&rsquo; dust to dust,&rdquo; two big tears suddenly burst from Peter&rsquo;s
    eyes, and hurried down to get entrapped in his beard.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s goldmining ventures were not successful. He sank three duffers
    in succession on Gulgong, and the fourth shaft, after paying expenses, left
    a little over a hundred to each party, and Peter had to send the bulk of
    his share home. He lived in a tent (or in a hut when he could get one) after
    the manner of diggers, and he &ldquo;did for himself&rdquo;, even to washing
    his own clothes. He never drank nor &ldquo;played&rdquo;, and he took little
    enjoyment of any kind, yet there was not a digger on the field who would
    dream of calling old Peter McKenzie &ldquo;a mean man&rdquo;. He lived, as
    we know from our own observations, in a most frugal manner. He always tried
    to hide this, and took care to have plenty of good things for us when he
    invited us to his hut; but children&rsquo;s eyes are sharp. Some said that
    Peter half-starved himself, but I don&rsquo;t think his family ever knew,
    unless he told them so afterwards.</p>
  <p>Ah, well! the years go over. Peter was now three years from home, and he
    and Fortune were enemies still. Letters came by the mail, full of little
    home troubles and prayers for Peter&rsquo;s return, and letters went back
    by the mail, always hopeful, always cheerful. Peter never gave up. When everything
    else failed he would work by the day (a sad thing for a digger), and he was
    even known to do a job of fencing until such time as he could get a few pounds
    and a small party together to sink another shaft.</p>
  <p>Talk about the heroic struggles of early explorers in a hostile country;
    but for dogged determination and courage in the face of poverty, illness,
    and distance, commend me to the old-time digger&mdash;the truest soldier
    Hope ever had!</p>
  <p>In the fourth year of his struggle Peter met with a terrible disappointment.
    His party put down a shaft called the Forlorn Hope near Happy Valley, and
    after a few weeks&rsquo; fruitless driving his mates jibbed on it. Peter
    had his own opinion about the ground&mdash;an old digger&rsquo;s opinion,
    and he used every argument in his power to induce his mates to put a few
    days&rsquo; more work in the claim. In vain he pointed out that the quality
    of the wash and the dip of the bottom exactly resembled that of the &ldquo;Brown
    Snake&rdquo;, a rich Victorian claim. In vain he argued that in the case
    of the abovementioned claim, not a colour could be got until the payable
    gold was actually reached. Home Rule and The Canadian and that cluster of
    fields were going ahead, and his party were eager to shift. They remained
    obstinate, and at last, half-convinced against his opinion, Peter left with
    them to sink the &ldquo;Iawatha&rdquo;, in Log Paddock, which turned out
    a rank duffer&mdash; not even paying its own expenses.</p>
  <p>A party of Italians entered the old claim and, after driving it a few feet
    further, made their fortune.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We all noticed the change in Peter McKenzie when he came to &ldquo;Log Paddock&rdquo;,
    whither we had shifted before him. The old smile still flickered, but he
    had learned to &ldquo;look&rdquo; grave for an hour at a time without much
    effort. He was never quite the same after the affair of Forlorn Hope, and
    I often think how he must have &ldquo;cried&rdquo;  sometimes &ldquo;inside&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>However, he still read us letters from home, and came and smoked in the
    evening by our kitchen-fire. He showed us some new portraits of his family
    which he had received by a late mail, but something gave me the impression
    that the portraits made him uneasy. He had them in his possession for nearly
    a week before showing them to us, and to the best of our knowledge he never
    showed them to anybody else. Perhaps they reminded him of the flight of time&mdash;perhaps
    he would have preferred his children to remain just as he left them until
    he returned.</p>
  <p>But stay! there was one portrait that seemed to give Peter infinite pleasure.
    It was the picture of a chubby infant of about three years or more. It was
    a fine-looking child taken in a sitting position on a cushion, and arrayed
    in a very short shirt. On its fat, soft, white face, which was only a few
    inches above the ten very podgy toes, was a smile something like Peter&rsquo;s.
    Peter was never tired of looking at and showing the picture of his child&mdash;the
    child he had never seen. Perhaps he cherished a wild dream of making his
    fortune and returning home before <i>that</i> child grew up.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>McKenzie and party were sinking a shaft at the upper end of Log Paddock,
    generally called &ldquo;The other end&rdquo;. We were at the lower end.</p>
  <p>One day Peter came down from &ldquo;the other end&rdquo; and told us that
    his party expected to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; during the following week, and
    if they got no encouragement from the wash they intended to go prospecting
    at the &ldquo;Happy Thought&rdquo;, near Specimen Flat.</p>
  <p>The shaft in Log Paddock was christened &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo;. Towards
    the end of the week we heard that the wash in the &ldquo;Nil&rdquo; was showing
    good colours.</p>
  <p>Later came the news that &ldquo;McKenzie and party&rdquo; had bottomed on
    payable gold, and the red flag floated over the shaft. Long before the first
    load of dirt reached the puddling machine on the creek, the news was all
    round the diggings. The &ldquo;Nil Desperandum&rdquo; was a &ldquo;Golden
    Hole&rdquo;!</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>We will not forget the day when Peter went home. He hurried down in the
    morning to have an hour or so with us before Cobb and Co. went by. He told
    us all about his little cottage by the bay at St. Kilda. He had never spoken
    of it before, probably because of the mortgage. He told us how it faced the
    bay&mdash;how many rooms it had, how much flower garden, and how on a clear
    day he could see from the window all the ships that came up to the Yarra,
    and how with a good telescope he could even distinguish the faces of the
    passengers on the big ocean liners.</p>
  <p>And then, when the mother&rsquo;s back was turned, he hustled us children
    round the corner, and surreptitiously slipped a sovereign into each of our
    dirty hands, making great pantomimic show for silence, for the mother was
    very independent.</p>
  <p>And when we saw the last of Peter&rsquo;s face setting like a good-humoured
    sun on the top of Cobb and Co.&rsquo;s, a great feeling of discontent and
    loneliness came over all our hearts. Little Nelse, who had been Peter&rsquo;s
    favourite, went round behind the pig-stye, where none might disturb him,
    and sat down on the projecting end of a trough to &ldquo;have a cry&rdquo;,
    in his usual methodical manner. But old &ldquo;Alligator Desolation&rdquo;,
    the dog, had suspicions of what was up, and, hearing the sobs, went round
    to offer whatever consolation appertained to a damp and dirty nose and a
    pair of ludicrously doleful yellow eyes.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnOversightofSteelmans"></a>An Oversight of
      Steelman&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman and Smith&mdash;professional wanderers&mdash;were making back for
    Wellington, down through the wide and rather dreary-looking Hutt Valley.
    They were broke. They carried their few remaining belongings in two skimpy,
    amateurish-looking swags. Steelman had fourpence left. They were very tired
    and very thirsty&mdash;at least Steelman was, and he answered for both. It
    was Smith&rsquo;s policy to feel and think just exactly as Steelman did.
    Said Steelman:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The landlord of the next pub. is not a bad sort. I won&rsquo;t go
    in&mdash; he might remember me. You&rsquo;d best go in. You&rsquo;ve been
    tramping round in the Wairarapa district for the last six months, looking
    for work. You&rsquo;re going back to Wellington now, to try and get on the
    new corporation works just being started there&mdash;the sewage works. You
    think you&rsquo;ve got a show. You&rsquo;ve got some mates in Wellington,
    and they&rsquo;re looking out for a chance for you. You did get a job last
    week on a sawmill at Silverstream, and the boss sacked you after three days
    and wouldn&rsquo;t pay you a penny. That&rsquo;s just his way. I know him&mdash; at
    least a mate of mine does. I&rsquo;ve heard of him often enough. His name&rsquo;s
    Cowman. Don&rsquo;t forget the name, whatever you do. The landlord here hates
    him like poison; he&rsquo;ll sympathize with you. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got
    a mate with you; he&rsquo;s gone ahead&mdash;took a short cut across the
    paddocks. Tell him you&rsquo;ve got only fourpence left, and see if he&rsquo;ll
    give you a drop in a bottle. Says you: &lsquo;Well, boss, the fact is we&rsquo;ve
    only got fourpence, but you might let us have a drop in a bottle&rsquo;;
    and very likely he&rsquo;ll stand you a couple of pints in a gin-bottle.
    You can fling the coppers on the counter, but the chances are he won&rsquo;t
    take them. He&rsquo;s not a bad sort. Beer&rsquo;s fourpence a pint out here,
    same&rsquo;s in Wellington. See that gin-bottle lying there by the stump;
    get it and we&rsquo;ll take it down to the river with us and rinse it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the river bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take my swag&mdash;it looks more decent,&rdquo; said
    Steelman. &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do: we&rsquo;ll
    undo both swags and make them into one&mdash;one decent swag, and I&rsquo;ll
    cut round through the lanes and wait for you on the road ahead of the pub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rolled up the swag with much care and deliberation and considerable judgment.
    He fastened Smith&rsquo;s belt round one end of it, and the handkerchiefs
    round the other, and made a towel serve as a shoulder-strap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a canvas bag to put it in,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or
    a cover of some sort. But never mind. The landlord&rsquo;s an old Australian
    bushman, now I come to think of it; the swag looks Australian enough, and
    it might appeal to his feelings, you know&mdash;bring up old recollections.
    But you&rsquo;d best not say you come from Australia, because he&rsquo;s
    been there, and he&rsquo;d soon trip you up. He might have been where you&rsquo;ve
    been, you know, so don&rsquo;t try to do too much. You always do mug-up the
    business when you try to do more than I tell you. You might tell him your
    mate came from Australia&mdash;but no, he might want you to bring me in.
    Better stick to Maoriland. I don&rsquo;t believe in too much ornamentation.
    Plain lies are the best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the landlord&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that. You don&rsquo;t want to know that. You are not supposed
    to know him at all. It might look suspicious if you called him by his name,
    and lead to awkward questions; then you&rsquo;d be sure to put your foot
    into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could say I read it over the door.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bosh. Travellers don&rsquo;t read the names over the doors, when
    they go into pubs. You&rsquo;re an entire stranger to him. Call him &lsquo;Boss&rsquo;.
    Say &lsquo;Good-day, Boss,&rsquo;  when you go in, and swing down your swag
    as if you&rsquo;re used to it. Ease it down like this. Then straighten yourself
    up, stick your hat back, and wipe your forehead, and try to look as hearty
    and independent and cheerful as you possibly can. Curse the Government, and
    say the country&rsquo;s done. It don&rsquo;t matter what Government it is,
    for he&rsquo;s always against it. I never knew a real Australian that wasn&rsquo;t.
    Say that you&rsquo;re thinking about trying to get over to Australia, and
    then listen to him talking about it&mdash; and try to look interested, too!
    Get that damned stone-deaf expression off your face! . . . He&rsquo;ll run
    Australia down most likely (I never knew an Other-sider that had settled
    down over here who didn&rsquo;t). But don&rsquo;t you make any mistake and
    agree with him, because, although successful Australians over here like to
    run their own country down, there&rsquo;s very few of them that care to hear
    anybody else do it. . . . Don&rsquo;t come away as soon as you get your beer.
    Stay and listen to him for a while, as if you&rsquo;re interested in his
    yarning, and give him time to put you on to a job, or offer you one. Give
    him a chance to ask how you and your mate are off for tobacco or tucker.
    Like as not he&rsquo;ll sling you half a crown when you come away&mdash;that
    is, if you work it all right. Now try to think of something to say to him,
    and make yourself a bit interesting&mdash;if you possibly can. Tell him about
    the fight we saw back at the pub. the other day. He might know some of the
    chaps. This is a sleepy hole, and there ain&rsquo;t much news knocking round.
    . . . I wish I could go in myself, but he&rsquo;s sure to remember <i>me</i>.
    I&rsquo;m afraid he got left the last time I stayed there (so did one or
    two others); and, besides, I came away without saying good-bye to him, and
    he might feel a bit sore about it. That&rsquo;s the worst of travelling on
    the old road. Come on now, wake up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bet I&rsquo;ll get a quart,&rdquo; said Smith, brightening up, &ldquo;and
    some tucker for it to wash down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stoush
    you. Never mind the bottle; fling it away. It doesn&rsquo;t look well for
    a traveller to go into a pub. with an empty bottle in his hand. A real swagman
    never does. It looks much better to come out with a couple of full ones.
    That&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve got to do. Now, come along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman turned off into a lane, cut across the paddocks to the road again,
    and waited for Smith. He hadn&rsquo;t long to wait.</p>
  <p>Smith went on towards the public-house, rehearsing his part as he walked&mdash;  repeating
    his &ldquo;lines&rdquo; to himself, so as to be sure of remembering all that
    Steelman had told him to say to the landlord, and adding, with what he considered
    appropriate gestures, some fancy touches of his own, which he determined
    to throw in in spite of Steelman&rsquo;s advice and warning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell him (this)&mdash;I&rsquo;ll tell him (that). Well, look here, boss,
    I&rsquo;ll say you&rsquo;re pretty right and I quite agree with you as far
    as that&rsquo;s concerned, but,&rdquo; &amp;c. And so, murmuring and mumbling
    to himself, Smith reached the hotel. The day was late, and the bar was small,
    and low, and dark. Smith walked in with all the assurance he could muster,
    eased down his swag in a corner in what he no doubt considered the true professional
    style, and, swinging round to the bar, said in a loud voice which he intended
    to be cheerful, independent, and hearty:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But it wasn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;boss&rdquo;. It was about the hardest-faced
    old woman that Smith had ever seen. The pub. had changed hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; stammered poor Smith.</p>
  <p>It was a knock-down blow for Smith. He couldn&rsquo;t come to time. He and
    Steelman had had a landlord in their minds all the time, and laid their plans
    accordingly; the possibility of having a she &mdash;and one like this&mdash;to
    deal with never entered into their calculations. Smith had no time to reorganise,
    even if he had had the brains to do so, without the assistance of his mate&rsquo;s
    knowledge of human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg your pardon, missus,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
  <p>Painful pause. She sized him up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what do you want?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus&mdash;I&mdash;the fact is&mdash;will you give me a bottle
    of beer for fourpence?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean&mdash;&mdash;. The fact is, we&rsquo;ve only got fourpence
    left, and&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate outside, and you might let us have
    a quart or so, in a bottle, for that. I mean&mdash;anyway, you might let
    us have a pint. I&rsquo;m very sorry to bother you, missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But she couldn&rsquo;t do it. No. Certainly not. Decidedly not! All her
    drinks were sixpence. She had her license to pay, and the rent, and a family
    to keep. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay out there&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t worth her
    while. It wouldn&rsquo;t pay the cost of carting the liquor out, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, missus,&rdquo; poor Smith blurted out at last, in sheer desperation,  &ldquo;give
    me what you can in a bottle for this. I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got a mate
    outside.&rdquo; And he put the four coppers on the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got a bottle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I give you one, will you bring it back? You can&rsquo;t expect
    me to give you a bottle as well as a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, mum; I&rsquo;ll bring it back directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She reached out a bottle from under the bar, and very deliberately measured
    out a little over a pint and poured it into the bottle, which she handed
    to Smith without a cork.</p>
  <p>Smith went his way without rejoicing. It struck him forcibly that he should
    have saved the money until they reached Petone, or the city, where Steelman
    would be sure to get a decent drink. But how was he to know? He had chanced
    it, and lost; Steelman might have done the same. What troubled Smith most
    was the thought of what Steelman would say; he already heard him, in imagination,
    saying: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a mug, Smith&mdash; Smith, you <i>are</i> a mug.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Steelman didn&rsquo;t say much. He was prepared for the worst by seeing
    Smith come along so soon. He listened to his story with an air of gentle
    sadness, even as a stern father might listen to the voluntary confession
    of a wayward child; then he held the bottle up to the fading light of departing
    day, looked through it (the bottle), and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t worth while dividing it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith&rsquo;s heart shot right down through a hole in the sole of his left
    boot into the hard road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, handing him the bottle, &ldquo;drink
    it, old man; you want it. It wasn&rsquo;t altogether your fault; it was an
    oversight of mine. I didn&rsquo;t bargain for a woman of that kind, and,
    of course, <i>you</i> couldn&rsquo;t be expected to think of it. Drink it!
    Drink it down, Smith. I&rsquo;ll manage to work the oracle before this night
    is out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith was forced to believe his ears, and, recovering from his surprise,
    drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promised to take back the bottle,&rdquo; he said, with the ghost
    of a smile.</p>
  <p>Steelman took the bottle by the neck and broke it on the fence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Smith; I&rsquo;ll carry the swag for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they tramped on in the gathering starlight.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="HowSteelmantoldhisStory"></a>How Steelman told
      his Story</b></h2>
  <p>It was Steelman&rsquo;s humour, in some of his moods, to take Smith into
    his confidence, as some old bushmen do their dogs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re nearly as good as an intelligent sheep-dog to talk to,
    Smith&mdash;  when a man gets tired of thinking to himself and wants a relief.
    You&rsquo;re a bit of a mug and a good deal of an idiot, and the chances
    are that you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m driving at half the time&mdash; that&rsquo;s
    the main reason why I don&rsquo;t mind talking to you. You ought to consider
    yourself honoured; it ain&rsquo;t every man I take into my confidence, even
    that far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner talk to you&mdash;or a stump&mdash;any day than
    to one of those silent, suspicious, self-contained, worldly-wise chaps that
    listen to everything you say&mdash;sense and rubbish alike&mdash;as if you
    were trying to get them to take shares in a mine. I drop the man who listens
    to me all the time and doesn&rsquo;t seem to get bored. He isn&rsquo;t safe.
    He isn&rsquo;t to be trusted. He mostly wants to grind his axe against yours,
    and there&rsquo;s too little profit for me where there are two axes to grind,
    and no stone&mdash;though I&rsquo;d manage it once, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d you do it?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There are several ways. Either you join forces, for instance, and
    find a grindstone&mdash;or make one of the other man&rsquo;s axe. But the
    last way is too slow, and, as I said, takes too much brain-work&mdash; besides,
    it doesn&rsquo;t pay. It might satisfy your vanity or pride, but I&rsquo;ve
    got none. I had once, when I was younger, but it&mdash;well, it nearly killed
    me, so I dropped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can mostly trust the man who wants to talk more than you do;
    he&rsquo;ll make a safe mate&mdash;or a good grindstone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith scratched the nape of his neck and sat blinking at the fire, with
    the puzzled expression of a woman pondering over a life-question or the trimming
    of a hat. Steelman took his chin in his hand and watched Smith thoughtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I say, Steely,&rdquo; exclaimed Smith, suddenly, sitting
    up and scratching his head and blinking harder than ever&mdash;&ldquo;wha&mdash;what
    am I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I the axe or the grindstone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! your brain seems in extra good working order to-night, Smith.
    Well, you turn the grindstone and I grind.&rdquo; Smith settled. &ldquo;If
    you could grind better than I, I&rsquo;d turn the stone and let <i>you</i> grind,
    I&rsquo;d never go against the interests of the firm&mdash;that&rsquo;s fair
    enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; admitted Smith; &ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I. Now, Smith, we&rsquo;ve got along all right together for
    years, off and on, but you never know what might happen. I might stop breathing,
    for instance&mdash;and so might you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith began to look alarmed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poetical justice might overtake one or both of us&mdash;such things
    have happened before, though not often. Or, say, misfortune or death might
    mistake us for honest, hard-working mugs with big families to keep, and cut
    us off in the bloom of all our wisdom. You might get into trouble, and, in
    that case, I&rsquo;d be bound to leave you there, on principle; or I might
    get into trouble, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have the brains to get me out&mdash; though
    I know you&rsquo;d be mug enough to try. I might make a rise and cut you,
    or you might be misled into showing some spirit, and clear out after I&rsquo;d
    stoushed you for it. You might get tired of me calling you a mug, and bossing
    you and making a tool or convenience of you, you know. You might go in for
    honest graft (you were always a bit weak-minded) and then I&rsquo;d have
    to wash my hands of you (unless you agreed to keep me) for an irreclaimable
    mug. Or it might suit me to become a respected and worthy fellow townsman,
    and then, if you came within ten miles of me or hinted that you ever knew
    me, I&rsquo;d have you up for vagrancy, or soliciting alms, or attempting
    to levy blackmail. I&rsquo;d have to fix you&mdash;so I give you fair warning.
    Or we might get into some desperate fix (and it needn&rsquo;t be very desperate,
    either) when I&rsquo;d be obliged to sacrifice you for my own personal safety,
    comfort, and convenience. Hundreds of things might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I said, we&rsquo;ve been at large together for some years,
    and I&rsquo;ve found you sober, trustworthy, and honest; so, in case we do
    part &mdash;as we will sooner or later&mdash;and you survive, I&rsquo;ll
    give you some advice from my own experience.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In the first place: If you ever happen to get born again &mdash;and
    it wouldn&rsquo;t do you much harm&mdash;get born with the strength of a
    bullock and the hide of one as well, and a swelled head, and no brains&mdash; at
    least no more brains than you&rsquo;ve got now. I was born with a skin like
    tissue-paper, and brains; also a heart.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get born without relatives, if you can: if you can&rsquo;t help it,
    clear out on your own just as soon after you&rsquo;re born as you possibly
    can. I hung on.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you have relations, and feel inclined to help them any time when
    you&rsquo;re flush (and there&rsquo;s no telling what a weak-minded man like
    you might take it into his head to do)&mdash;don&rsquo;t do it. They&rsquo;ll
    get a down on you if you do. It only causes family troubles and bitterness.
    There&rsquo;s no dislike like that of a dependant. You&rsquo;ll get neither
    gratitude nor civility in the end, and be lucky if you escape with a character.
    (You&rsquo;ve got <i>no</i> character, Smith; I&rsquo;m only just supposing
    you have.) There&rsquo;s no hatred too bitter for, and nothing too bad to
    be said of, the mug who turns. The worst yarns about a man are generally
    started by his own tribe, and the world believes them at once on that very
    account. Well, the first thing to do in life is to escape from your friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you ever go to work&mdash;and miracles have happened before&mdash; no
    matter what your wages are, or how you are treated, you can take it for granted
    that you&rsquo;re sweated; act on that to the best of your ability, or you&rsquo;ll
    never rise in the world. If you go to see a show on the nod you&rsquo;ll
    be found a comfortable seat in a good place; but if you pay the chances are
    the ticket clerk will tell you a lie, and you&rsquo;ll have to hustle for
    standing room. The man that doesn&rsquo;t ante gets the best of this world;
    anything he&rsquo;ll stand is good enough for the man that pays. If you try
    to be too sharp you&rsquo;ll get into gaol sooner or later; if you try to
    be too honest the chances are that the bailiff will get into your house&mdash;if
    you have one&mdash;and make a holy show of you before the neighbours. The
    honest softy is more often mistaken for a swindler, and accused of being
    one, than the out-and-out scamp; and the man that tells the truth too much
    is set down as an irreclaimable liar. But most of the time crow low and roost
    high, for it&rsquo;s a funny world, and you never know what might happen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And if you get married (and there&rsquo;s no accounting for a woman&rsquo;s
    taste) be as bad as you like, and then moderately good, and your wife will
    love you. If you&rsquo;re bad all the time she can&rsquo;t stand it for ever,
    and if you&rsquo;re good all the time she&rsquo;ll naturally treat you with
    contempt. Never explain what you&rsquo;re going to do, and don&rsquo;t explain
    afterwards, if you can help it. If you find yourself between two stools,
    strike hard for your own self, Smith&mdash;strike hard, and you&rsquo;ll
    be respected more than if you fought for all the world. Generosity isn&rsquo;t
    understood nowadays, and what the people don&rsquo;t understand is either &lsquo;mad&rsquo; or &lsquo;cronk&rsquo;.
    Failure has no case, and you can&rsquo;t build one for it. . . . I started
    out in life very young&mdash;and very soft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>

  <h1 align="center"><b>Over the Sliprails </b></h1>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShantyKeepersWife"></a>The Shanty-Keeper&rsquo;s
      Wife</b></h2>
  <p>There were about a dozen of us jammed into the coach, on the box seat and
    hanging on to the roof and tailboard as best we could. We were shearers,
    bagmen, agents, a squatter, a cockatoo, the usual joker&mdash;and one or
    two professional spielers, perhaps. We were tired and stiff and nearly frozen&mdash;too
    cold to talk and too irritable to risk the inevitable argument which an interchange
    of ideas would have led up to. We had been looking forward for hours, it
    seemed, to the pub where we were to change horses. For the last hour or two
    all that our united efforts had been able to get out of the driver was a
    grunt to the effect that it was &ldquo;&rsquo;bout a couple o&rsquo; miles.&rdquo; Then
    he said, or grunted, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t fur now,&rdquo; a couple
    of times, and refused to commit himself any further; he seemed grumpy about
    having committed himself that far.</p>
  <p>He was one of those men who take everything in dead earnest; who regard
    any expression of ideas outside their own sphere of life as trivial, or,
    indeed, if addressed directly to them, as offensive; who, in fact, are darkly
    suspicious of anything in the shape of a joke or laugh on the part of an
    outsider in their own particular dust-hole. He seemed to be always thinking,
    and thinking a lot; when his hands were not both engaged, he would tilt his
    hat forward and scratch the base of his skull with his little finger, and
    let his jaw hang. But his intellectual powers were mostly concentrated on
    a doubtful swingle-tree, a misfitting collar, or that there bay or piebald
    (on the off or near side) with the sore shoulder.</p>
  <p>Casual letters or papers, to be delivered on the road, were matters which
    troubled him vaguely, but constantly&mdash;like the abstract ideas of his
    passengers.</p>
  <p>The joker of our party was a humourist of the dry order, and had been slyly
    taking rises out of the driver for the last two or three stages. But the
    driver only brooded. He wasn&rsquo;t the one to tell you straight if you
    offended him, or if he fancied you offended him, and thus gain your respect,
    or prevent a misunderstanding which would result in life-long enmity. He
    might meet you in after years when you had forgotten all about your trespass&mdash;if
    indeed you had ever been conscious of it&mdash;and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; you
    unexpectedly on the ear.</p>
  <p>Also you might regard him as your friend, on occasion, and yet he would
    stand by and hear a perfect stranger tell you the most outrageous lies, to
    your hurt, and know that the stranger was telling lies, and never put you
    up to it. It would never enter his head to do so. It wouldn&rsquo;t be any
    affair of his&mdash;only an abstract question.</p>
  <p>It grew darker and colder. The rain came as if the frozen south were spitting
    at your face and neck and hands, and our feet grew as big as camel&rsquo;s,
    and went dead, and we might as well have stamped the footboards with wooden
    legs for all the feeling we got into ours. But they were more comfortable
    that way, for the toes didn&rsquo;t curl up and pain so much, nor did our
    corns stick out so hard against the leather, and shoot.</p>
  <p>We looked out eagerly for some clearing, or fence, or light&mdash;some sign
    of the shanty where we were to change horses&mdash;but there was nothing
    save blackness all round. The long, straight, cleared road was no longer
    relieved by the ghostly patch of light, far ahead, where the bordering tree-walls
    came together in perspective and framed the ether. We were down in the bed
    of the bush.</p>
  <p>We pictured a haven of rest with a suspended lamp burning in the frosty
    air outside and a big log fire in a cosy parlour off the bar, and a long
    table set for supper. But this is a land of contradictions; wayside shanties
    turn up unexpectedly and in the most unreasonable places, and are, as likely
    as not, prepared for a banquet when you are not hungry and can&rsquo;t wait,
    and as cold and dark as a bushman&rsquo;s grave when you are and can.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the driver said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re there now.&rdquo; He said this
    as if he had driven us to the scaffold to be hanged, and was fiercely glad
    that he&rsquo;d got us there safely at last. We looked but saw nothing; then
    a light appeared ahead and seemed to come towards us; and presently we saw
    that it was a lantern held up by a man in a slouch hat, with a dark bushy
    beard, and a three-bushel bag around his shoulders. He held up his other
    hand, and said something to the driver in a tone that might have been used
    by the leader of a search party who had just found the body. The driver stopped
    and then went on slowly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; we asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The publican&rsquo;s wife is sick,&rdquo; somebody said, &ldquo;and
    he wants us to come quietly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The usual little slab and bark shanty was suggested in the gloom, with a
    big bark stable looming in the background. We climbed down like so many cripples.
    As soon as we began to feel our legs and be sure we had the right ones and
    the proper allowance of feet, we helped, as quietly as possible, to take
    the horses out and round to the stable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is she very bad?&rdquo; we asked the publican, showing as much concern
    as we could.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, in a subdued voice of a rough man who had spent
    several anxious, sleepless nights by the sick bed of a dear one. &ldquo;But,
    God willing, I think we&rsquo;ll pull her through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus encouraged we said, sympathetically: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re very sorry
    to trouble you, but I suppose we could manage to get a drink and a bit to
    eat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing to eat in the
    house, and I&rsquo;ve only got rum and milk. You can have that if you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One of the pilgrims broke out here.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well of all the pubs,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve ever&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>The pilgrim scowled and retired to the rear. You can&rsquo;t express your
    feelings freely when there&rsquo;s a woman dying close handy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, who says rum and milk?&rdquo; asked the joker, in a low voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait here,&rdquo; said the publican, and disappeared into the little
    front passage.</p>
  <p>Presently a light showed through a window, with a scratched and fly-bitten
    B and A on two panes, and a mutilated R on the third, which was broken. A
    door opened, and we sneaked into the bar. It was like having drinks after
    hours where the police are strict and independent.</p>
  <p>When we came out the driver was scratching his head and looking at the harness
    on the verandah floor.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You fellows &rsquo;ll have ter put in the time for an hour or so.
    The horses is out back somewheres,&rdquo; and he indicated the interior of
    Australia with a side jerk of his head, &ldquo;and the boy ain&rsquo;t back
    with &rsquo;em yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But dash it all,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How long are the horses likely to be?&rdquo; we asked the driver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; he grunted. &ldquo;Might be three or four hours. It&rsquo;s
    all accordin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said the Pilgrim, &ldquo;me and my mate wanter
    catch the train.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush-sh-sh!&rdquo; from the publican in a fierce whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, boss,&rdquo; said the joker, &ldquo;can you let us have beds,
    then? I don&rsquo;t want to freeze here all night, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;I can do that, but some of
    you will have to sleep double and some of you&rsquo;ll have to take it out
    of the sofas, and one or two &rsquo;ll have to make a shakedown on the floor.
    There&rsquo;s plenty of bags in the stable, and you&rsquo;ve got rugs and
    coats with you. Fix it up amongst yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here!&rdquo; interrupted the Pilgrim, desperately, &ldquo;we
    can&rsquo;t afford to wait! We&rsquo;re only &lsquo;battlers&rsquo;, me and
    my mate, pickin&rsquo; up crumbs by the wayside. We&rsquo;ve got to catch
    the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the publican, savagely. &ldquo;You fool, didn&rsquo;t
    I tell you my missus was bad? I won&rsquo;t have any noise.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But look here,&rdquo; protested the Pilgrim, &ldquo;we must catch
    the train at Dead Camel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll catch my boot presently,&rdquo; said the publican, with
    a savage oath, &ldquo;and go further than Dead Camel. I won&rsquo;t have
    my missus disturbed for you or any other man! Just you shut up or get out,
    and take your blooming mate with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We lost patience with the Pilgrim and sternly took him aside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, for God&rsquo;s sake, hold your jaw,&rdquo; we said. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any consideration at all? Can&rsquo;t you see the man&rsquo;s wife
    is ill&mdash;dying perhaps&mdash;and he nearly worried off his head?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pilgrim and his mate were scraggy little bipeds of the city push variety,
    so they were suppressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; yawned the joker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to roost
    on a stump all night. I&rsquo;m going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be eighteenpence each,&rdquo; hinted the landlord. &ldquo;You
    can settle now if you like to save time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We took the hint, and had another drink. I don&rsquo;t know how we  &ldquo;fixed
    it up amongst ourselves,&rdquo; but we got settled down somehow. There was
    a lot of mysterious whispering and scuffling round by the light of a couple
    of dirty greasy bits of candle. Fortunately we dared not speak loud enough
    to have a row, though most of us were by this time in the humour to pick
    a quarrel with a long-lost brother.</p>
  <p>The Joker got the best bed, as good-humoured, good-natured chaps generally
    do, without seeming to try for it. The growler of the party got the floor
    and chaff bags, as selfish men mostly do&mdash;without seeming to try for
    it either. I took it out of one of the &ldquo;sofas&rdquo;, or rather that
    sofa took it out of me. It was short and narrow and down by the head, with
    a leaning to one corner on the outside, and had more nails and bits of gin-case
    than original sofa in it.</p>
  <p>I had been asleep for three seconds, it seemed, when somebody shook me by
    the shoulder and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take yer seats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I got out, the driver was on the box, and the others were getting rum
    and milk inside themselves (and in bottles) before taking their seats.</p>
  <p>It was colder and darker than before, and the South Pole seemed nearer,
    and pretty soon, but for the rum, we should have been in a worse fix than
    before.</p>
  <p>There was a spell of grumbling. Presently someone said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe them horses was lost at all. I was round behind
    the stable before I went to bed, and seen horses there; and if they wasn&rsquo;t
    them same horses there, I&rsquo;ll eat &rsquo;em raw!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer?&rdquo; said the driver, in a disinterested tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I would,&rdquo; said the passenger. Then, with a sudden ferocity, &ldquo;and
    you too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The driver said nothing. It was an abstract question which didn&rsquo;t
    interest him.</p>
  <p>We saw that we were on delicate ground, and changed the subject for a while.
    Then someone else said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where his missus was? I didn&rsquo;t see any signs of her
    about, or any other woman about the place, and we was pretty well all over
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have kept her in the stable,&rdquo; suggested the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she wasn&rsquo;t, for Scotty and that chap on the roof was there
    after bags.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She might have been in the loft,&rdquo; reflected the Joker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was no loft,&rdquo; put in a voice from the top of the coach.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Mister&mdash;Mister man,&rdquo; said the Joker suddenly to
    the driver,  &ldquo;Was his missus sick at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; replied the driver. &ldquo;She might have been. He
    said so, anyway. I ain&rsquo;t got no call to call a man a liar.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said the cannibalistic individual to the driver,
    in the tone of a man who has made up his mind for a row, &ldquo;has that
    shanty-keeper got a wife at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe he has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is she living with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, she ain&rsquo;t&mdash;if yer wanter know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then where is she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno. How am I to know? She left him three or four years ago.
    She was in Sydney last time I heard of her. It ain&rsquo;t no affair of mine,
    anyways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And is there any woman about the place at all, driver?&rdquo; inquired
    a professional wanderer reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not that I knows on. There useter be a old black gin come
    pottering round sometimes, but I ain&rsquo;t seen her lately.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And excuse me, driver, but is there anyone round there at all?&rdquo;  enquired
    the professional wanderer, with the air of a conscientious writer, collecting
    material for an Australian novel from life, with an eye to detail.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the driver&mdash;and recollecting that he was expected
    to be civil and obliging to his employers&rsquo; patrons, he added in surly
    apology, &ldquo;Only the boss and the stableman, that I knows of.&rdquo; Then
    repenting of the apology, he asserted his manhood again, and asked, in a
    tone calculated to risk a breach of the peace, &ldquo;Any more questions,
    gentlemen&mdash;while the shop&rsquo;s open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a long pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Driver,&rdquo; asked the Pilgrim appealingly, &ldquo;was them horses
    lost at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said the driver. &ldquo;He said they was. He&rsquo;s
    got the looking after them. It was nothing to do with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Twelve drinks at sixpence a drink&rdquo;&mdash;said the Joker, as
    if calculating to himself&mdash;&ldquo;that&rsquo;s six bob, and, say on
    an average, four shouts&mdash;that&rsquo;s one pound four. Twelve beds at
    eighteenpence a bed&mdash;that&rsquo;s eighteen shillings; and say ten bob
    in various drinks and the stuff we brought with us, that&rsquo;s two pound
    twelve. That publican didn&rsquo;t do so bad out of us in two hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We wondered how much the driver got out of it, but thought it best not to
    ask him.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t say much for the rest of the journey. There was the usual
    man who thought as much and knew all about it from the first, but he wasn&rsquo;t
    appreciated. We suppressed him. One or two wanted to go back and &ldquo;stoush&rdquo; that
    landlord, and the driver stopped the coach cheerfully at their request; but
    they said they&rsquo;d come across him again and allowed themselves to be
    persuaded out of it. It made us feel bad to think how we had allowed ourselves
    to be delayed, and robbed, and had sneaked round on tiptoe, and how we had
    sat on the inoffensive Pilgrim and his mate, and all on account of a sick
    wife who didn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
  <p>The coach arrived at Dead Camel in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion and
    distrust, and we spread ourselves over the train and departed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AGentlemanSharperandSteelmanSharper"></a>A Gentleman
      Sharper and Steelman Sharper</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman and Smith had been staying at the hotel for several days in the
    dress and character of bushies down for what they considered a spree. The
    gentleman sharper from the Other Side had been hanging round them for three
    days now. Steelman was the more sociable, and, to all appearances, the greener
    of the two bush mates; but seemed rather too much under the influence of
    Smith, who was reserved, suspicious, self-contained, or sulky. He almost
    scowled at Gentleman Sharper&rsquo;s &ldquo;Good-morning!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fine
    day!&rdquo;, replied in monosyllables and turned half away with an uneasy,
    sullen, resentful hump of his shoulder and shuffle of his feet.</p>
  <p>Steelman took Smith for a stroll on the round, bald tussock hills surrounding
    the city, and rehearsed him for the last act until after sundown.</p>
  <p>Gentleman Sharper was lounging, with a cigar, on the end of the balcony,
    where he had been contentedly contemplating the beautiful death of day. His
    calm, classic features began to whiten (and sharpen) in the frosty moonlight.</p>
  <p>Steelman and Smith sat on deck-chairs behind a half-screen of ferns on the
    other end of the balcony, smoked their after-dinner smoke, and talked in
    subdued tones as befitted the time and the scene&mdash;great, softened, misty
    hills in a semicircle, and the water and harbour lights in moonlight.</p>
  <p>The other boarders were loitering over dinner, in their rooms, or gone out;
    the three were alone on the balcony, which was a rear one.</p>
  <p>Gentleman Sharper moved his position, carelessly, noiselessly, yet quickly,
    until he leaned on the rail close to the ferns and could overhear every word
    the bushies said. He had dropped his cigar overboard, and his scented handkerchief
    behind a fern-pot en route.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he looks all right, and acts all right, and talks all right&mdash;and
    shouts all right,&rdquo; protested Steelman. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not stumped,
    for I saw twenty or thirty sovereigns when he shouted; and he doesn&rsquo;t
    seem to care a damn whether we stand in with him or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There you are! That&rsquo;s just where it is!&rdquo; said Smith,
    with some logic, but in a tone a wife uses in argument (which tone, by the
    way, especially if backed by logic or common sense, makes a man wild sooner
    than anything else in this world of troubles).</p>
  <p>Steelman jerked his chair half-round in disgust. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; he
    snorted, &ldquo;always suspicious! Always suspicious of everybody and everything!
    If I found myself shot into a world where I couldn&rsquo;t trust anybody
    I&rsquo;d shoot myself out of it. Life would be worse than not worth living.
    Smith, you&rsquo;ll never make money, except by hard graft&mdash;hard, bullocking,
    nigger-driving graft like we had on that damned railway section for the last
    six months, up to our knees in water all winter, and all for a paltry cheque
    of one-fifty&mdash;twenty of that gone already. How do you expect to make
    money in this country if you won&rsquo;t take anything for granted, except
    hard cash? I tell you, Smith, there&rsquo;s a thousand pounds lost for every
    one gained or saved by trusting too little. How did Vanderbilt and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman elaborated to a climax, slipping a glance warily, once or twice,
    out of the tail of his eye through the ferns, low down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There never was a fortune made that wasn&rsquo;t made by chancing
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He nudged Smith to come to the point. Presently Smith asked, sulkily:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what was he saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I told you! He says he&rsquo;s behind the scenes in this
    gold boom, and, if he had a hundred pounds ready cash to-morrow, he&rsquo;d
    make three of it before Saturday. He said he could put one-fifty to one-fifty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And isn&rsquo;t he worth three hundred?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you,&rdquo; demanded Steelman, with an impatient
    ring, and speaking rapidly, &ldquo;that he lost his mail in the wreck of
    the &lsquo;Tasman&rsquo;? You know she went down the day before yesterday,
    and the divers haven&rsquo;t got at the mails yet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.... But why doesn&rsquo;t he wire to Sydney for some stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;! Well, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to have patience
    with a born natural. Look here, Smith, the fact of the matter is that he&rsquo;s
    a sort of black-sheep&mdash;sent out on the remittance system, if the truth
    is known, and with letters of introduction to some big-bugs out here&mdash;that
    explains how he gets to know these wire-pullers behind the boom. His people
    have probably got the quarterly allowance business fixed hard and tight with
    a bank or a lawyer in Sydney; and there&rsquo;ll have to be enquiries about
    the lost &lsquo;draft&rsquo; (as he calls a cheque) and a letter or maybe
    a cable home to England; and it might take weeks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Smith, hesitatingly. &ldquo;That all sounds right
    enough. But&rdquo;&mdash;with an inspiration&mdash;&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t
    he go to one of these big-bug boomsters he knows&mdash;that he got letters
    of introduction to&mdash;and get him to fix him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; exclaimed Steelman, hopelessly. &ldquo;Listen to
    him! Can&rsquo;t you see that they&rsquo;re the last men he wants to let
    into his game? Why, he wants to use <i>them!</i> They&rsquo;re the mugs as
    far as he is concerned!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I see!&rdquo; said Smith, after hesitating, and rather slowly&mdash;as
    if he hadn&rsquo;t quite finished seeing yet.</p>
  <p>Steelman glanced furtively at the fern-screen, and nudged Smith again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He said if he had three hundred, he&rsquo;d double it by Saturday?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he said,&rdquo; replied Steelman, seeming by his
    tone to be losing interest in the conversation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And... well, if he had a hundred he could double that, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. What are you driving at now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If he had twenty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, God! I&rsquo;m sick of you, Smith. What the&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on. Let me finish. I was only going to say that I&rsquo;m willing
    to put up a fiver, and you put up another fiver, and if he doubles that for
    us then we can talk about standing in with him with a hundred&mdash;provided
    he can show his hundred.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After some snarling Steelman said: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try him! Now
    are you satisfied?&rdquo;...</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s moved off now,&rdquo; he added in a whisper; &ldquo;but
    stay here and talk a bit longer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Passing through the hall they saw Gentleman Sharper standing carelessly
    by the door of the private bar. He jerked his head in the direction of drinks.
    Steelman accepted the invitation&mdash;Smith passed on. Steelman took the
    opportunity to whisper to the Sharper&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking
    that over with my mate, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come for a stroll,&rdquo; suggested the professional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a cigar?&rdquo; and they passed out.</p>
  <p>When they returned Steelman went straight to the room he occupied with Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much stuff have we got, Smith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nine pounds seventeen and threepence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman gave an exclamation of disapproval with that state of financial
    affairs. He thought a second. &ldquo;I know the barman here, and I think
    he knows me. I&rsquo;ll chew his lug for a bob or may be a quid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Twenty minutes later he went to Gentleman Sharper&rsquo;s room with ten
    pounds&mdash;in very dirty Bank of New Zealand notes&mdash;such as those
    with which bush contractors pay their men.</p>
  <p>Two mornings later the sharper suggested a stroll. Steelman went with him,
    with a face carefully made up to hear the worst.</p>
  <p>After walking a hundred yards in a silence which might have been ominous&mdash;and
    was certainly pregnant&mdash;the sharper said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well... I tried the water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Steelman in a nervous tone. &ldquo;And how did you
    find it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as warm as I thought. Warm for a big splash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How? Did you lose the ten quid?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lose it! What did you take me for? I put ten to your ten as I told
    you I would. I landed 50 Pounds&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds for twenty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the tune of it&mdash;and not much of a tune, either.
    My God! If I&rsquo;d only had that thousand of mine by me, or even half of
    it, I&rsquo;d have made a pile!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds for twenty!&rdquo; cried Steelman excitedly. &ldquo;Why,
    that&rsquo;s grand! And to think we chaps have been grafting like niggers
    all our lives! By God, we&rsquo;ll stand in with you for all we&rsquo;ve
    got!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my hand on it,&rdquo; as they reached the hotel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If you come to my room I&rsquo;ll give you the 25 Pounds now, if
    you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; exclaimed Steelman impulsively; &ldquo;you
    mustn&rsquo;t think I don&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. Don&rsquo;t you say any more about it. You&rsquo;d
    best have the stuff to-night to show your mate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps so; he&rsquo;s a suspicious fool, but I made a bargain with
    him about our last cheque. He can hang on to the stuff, and I can&rsquo;t.
    If I&rsquo;d been on my own I&rsquo;d have blued it a week ago. Tell you
    what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call our share (Smith&rsquo;s and mine)
    twenty quid. You take the odd fiver for your trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That looks fair enough. We&rsquo;ll call it twenty guineas to you
    and your mate. We&rsquo;ll want him, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In his own and Smith&rsquo;s room Steelman thoughtfully counted twenty-one
    sovereigns on the toilet-table cover, and left them there in a pile.</p>
  <p>He stretched himself, scratched behind his ear, and blinked at the money
    abstractedly. Then he asked, as if the thought just occurred to him: &ldquo;By
    the way, Smith, do you see those yellow boys?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith saw. He had been sitting on the bed with a studiously vacant expression.
    It was Smith&rsquo;s policy not to seem, except by request, to take any interest
    in, or, in fact, to be aware of anything unusual that Steelman might be doing&mdash;from
    patching his pants to reading poetry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s twenty-one sovereigns there!&rdquo; remarked Steelman
    casually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer, Steely.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; added Steelman, solemnly and grimly, &ldquo;if you get
    taken down for &rsquo;em, or lose &rsquo;em out of the top-hole in your pocket,
    or spend so much as a shilling in riotous living, I&rsquo;ll stoush you,
    Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith didn&rsquo;t seem interested. They sat on the beds opposite each other
    for two or three minutes, in something of the atmosphere that pervades things
    when conversation has petered out and the dinner-bell is expected to ring.
    Smith screwed his face and squeezed a pimple on his throat; Steelman absently
    counted the flies on the wall. Presently Steelman, with a yawning sigh, lay
    back on the pillow with his hands clasped under his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take a few quid, Smith, and get that suit you were looking
    at the other day. Get a couple of shirts and collars, and some socks; better
    get a hat while you&rsquo;re at it&mdash;yours is a disgrace to your benefactor.
    And, I say, go to a chemist and get some cough stuff for that churchyarder
    of yours&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got no use for it just now, and it makes me sentimental.
    I&rsquo;ll give you a cough when you want one. Bring me a syphon of soda,
    some fruit, and a tract.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A tract. Go on. Start your boots.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While Smith was gone, Steelman paced the room with a strange, worried, haunted
    expression. He divided the gold that was left&mdash;(Smith had taken four
    pounds)&mdash;and put ten sovereigns in a pile on the extreme corner of the
    table. Then he walked up and down, up and down the room, arms tightly folded,
    and forehead knitted painfully, pausing abruptly now and then by the table
    to stare at the gold, until he heard Smith&rsquo;s step. Then his face cleared;
    he sat down and counted flies.</p>
  <p>Smith was undoing and inspecting the parcels, having placed the syphon and
    fruit on the table. Behind his back Steelman hurriedly opened a leather pocketbook
    and glanced at the portrait of a woman and child and at the date of a post-office
    order receipt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smith,&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re two honest, ignorant,
    green coves; hard-working chaps from the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether we are or not&mdash;we are as far
    as the world is concerned. Now we&rsquo;ve grafted like bullocks, in heat
    and wet, for six months, and made a hundred and fifty, and come down to have
    a bit of a holiday before going back to bullock for another six months or
    a year. Isn&rsquo;t that so, Smith?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could take your oath on it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is so or not&mdash;it <i>is</i> so,
    so far as the world is concerned. Now we&rsquo;ve paid our way straight.
    We&rsquo;ve always been pretty straight anyway, even if we are a pair of
    vagabonds, and I don&rsquo;t half like this new business; but it had to be
    done. If I hadn&rsquo;t taken down that sharper you&rsquo;d have lost confidence
    in me and wouldn&rsquo;t have been able to mask your feelings, and I&rsquo;d
    have had to stoush you. We&rsquo;re two hard-working, innocent bushies, down
    for an innocent spree, and we run against a cold-blooded professional sharper,
    a paltry sneak and a coward, who&rsquo;s got neither the brains nor the pluck
    to work in the station of life he togs himself for. He tries to do us out
    of our hard-earned little hundred and fifty&mdash;no matter whether we had
    it or not&mdash;and I&rsquo;m obliged to take him down. Serve him right for
    a crawler. You haven&rsquo;t the least idea what I&rsquo;m driving at, Smith,
    and that&rsquo;s the best of it. I&rsquo;ve driven a nail of my life home,
    and no pincers ever made will get it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Steely, what&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman rose, took up the pile of ten sovereigns, and placed it neatly
    on top of the rest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Put the stuff away, Smith.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After breakfast next morning, Gentleman Sharper hung round a bit, and then
    suggested a stroll. But Steelman thought the weather looked too bad, so they
    went on the balcony for a smoke. They talked of the weather, wrecks, and
    things, Steelman leaning with his elbows on the balcony rail, and Sharper
    sociably and confidently in the same position close beside him. But the professional
    was evidently growing uneasy in his mind; his side of the conversation grew
    awkward and disjointed, and he made the blunder of drifting into an embarrassing
    silence before coming to the point. He took one elbow from the rail, and
    said, with a bungling attempt at carelessness which was made more transparent
    by the awkward pause before it:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I must see to my correspondence. By the way, when could
    you make it convenient to let me have that hundred? The shares are starting
    up the last rise now, and we&rsquo;ve got no time to lose if we want to double
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman turned his face to him and winked once&mdash;a very hard, tight,
    cold wink&mdash;a wink in which there was no humour: such a wink as Steelman
    had once winked at a half-drunken bully who was going to have a lark with
    Smith.</p>
  <p>The sharper was one of those men who pull themselves together in a bad cause,
    as they stagger from the blow. But he wanted to think this time.</p>
  <p>Later on he approached Steelman quietly and proposed partnership. But Steelman
    gave him to understand (as between themselves) that he wasn&rsquo;t taking
    on any pupils just then.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnIncidentatStiffners"></a>An Incident at Stiffner&rsquo;s</b></h2>
  <p>They called him &ldquo;Stiffner&rdquo; because he used, long before, to
    get a living by poisoning wild dogs near the Queensland border. The name
    stuck to him closer than misfortune did, for when he rose to the proud and
    independent position of landlord and sole proprietor of an out-back pub he
    was Stiffner still, and his place was &ldquo;Stiffner&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;widely
    known.</p>
  <p>They do say that the name ceased not to be applicable&mdash;that it fitted
    even better than in the old dingo days, but&mdash;well, they do say so. All
    we can say is that when a shearer arrived with a cheque, and had a drink
    or two, he was almost invariably seized with a desire to camp on the premises
    for good, spend his cheque in the shortest possible time, and forcibly shout
    for everything within hail&mdash;including the Chinaman cook and Stiffner&rsquo;s
    disreputable old ram.</p>
  <p>The shanty was of the usual kind, and the scenery is as easily disposed
    of. There was a great grey plain stretching away from the door in front,
    and a mulga scrub from the rear; and in that scrub, not fifty yards from
    the kitchen door, were half a dozen nameless graves.</p>
  <p>Stiffner was always drunk, and Stiffner&rsquo;s wife&mdash;a hard-featured
    Amazon&mdash;was boss. The children were brought up in a detached cottage,
    under the care of a &ldquo;governess&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Stiffner had a barmaid as a bait for chequemen. She came from Sydney, they
    said, and her name was Alice. She was tall, boyishly handsome, and characterless;
    her figure might be described as &ldquo;fine&rdquo; or &ldquo;strapping&rdquo;,
    but her face was very cold&mdash;nearly colourless. She was one of those
    selfishly sensual women&mdash;thin lips, and hard, almost vacant grey eyes;
    no thought of anything but her own pleasures, none for the man&rsquo;s. Some
    shearers would roughly call her &ldquo;a squatter&rsquo;s girl&rdquo;. But
    she &ldquo;drew&rdquo;; she was handsome where women are scarce&mdash;very
    handsome, thought a tall, melancholy-looking jackeroo, whose evil spirit
    had drawn him to Stiffner&rsquo;s and the last shilling out of his pocket.</p>
  <p>Over the great grey plain, about a fortnight before, had come &ldquo;Old
    Danny&rdquo;, a station hand, for his semi-annual spree, and one &ldquo;Yankee
    Jack&rdquo; and his mate, shearers with horses, travelling for grass; and,
    about a week later, the Sydney jackeroo. There was also a sprinkling of assorted
    swagmen, who came in through the scrub and went out across the plain, or
    came in over the plain and went away through the scrub, according to which
    way their noses led them for the time being.</p>
  <p>There was also, for one day, a tall, freckled native (son of a neighbouring &ldquo;cocky&rdquo;),
    without a thought beyond the narrow horizon within which he lived. He had
    a very big opinion of himself in a very small mind. He swaggered into the
    breakfast-room and round the table to his place with an expression of ignorant
    contempt on his phiz, his snub nose in the air and his under lip out. But
    during the meal he condescended to ask the landlord if he&rsquo;d noticed
    that there horse that chap was ridin&rsquo; yesterday; and Stiffner having
    intimated that he had, the native entertained the company with his opinion
    of that horse, and of a certain &ldquo;youngster&rdquo; he was breaking in
    at home, and divers other horses, mostly his or his father&rsquo;s, and of
    a certain cattle slut,  &amp;c.... He spoke at the landlord, but to the company,
    most of the time. After breakfast he swaggered round some more, but condescended
    to &ldquo;shove&rdquo; his hand into his trousers, &ldquo;pull&rdquo; out
    a &ldquo;bob&rdquo; and &ldquo;chuck&rdquo; it into the (blanky) hat for
    a pool. Those words express the thing better than any others we can think
    of. Finally, he said he must be off; and, there being no opposition to his
    departure, he chucked his saddle on to his horse, chucked himself into the
    saddle, said &ldquo;s&rsquo;long,&rdquo; and slithered off. And no one missed
    him.</p>
  <p>Danny had been there a fortnight, and consequently his personal appearance
    was not now worth describing&mdash;it was better left alone, for the honour
    of the bush. His hobby was that he was the &ldquo;stranger&rsquo;s friend&rdquo;,
    as he put it. He&rsquo;d welcome &ldquo;the stranger&rdquo; and chum with
    him, and shout for him to an unlimited extent, and sympathise with him, hear
    of jobs or a &ldquo;show&rdquo; for him, assure him twenty times a day that
    he was his friend, give him hints and advice more or less worthless, make
    him drunk if possible, and keep him so while the cheque lasted; in short,
    Danny would do almost anything for the stranger except lend him a shilling,
    or give him some rations to carry him on. He&rsquo;d promise that many times
    a day, but he&rsquo;d sooner spend five pounds on drink for a man than give
    him a farthing.</p>
  <p>Danny&rsquo;s cheque was nearly gone, and it was time he was gone too; in
    fact, he had received, and was still receiving, various hints to that effect,
    some of them decidedly pointed, especially the more recent ones. But Danny
    was of late becoming foolishly obstinate in his sprees, and less disposed
    to &ldquo;git&rdquo; when a landlord had done with him. He saw the hints
    plainly enough, but had evidently made up his mind to be doggedly irresponsive.
    It is a mistake to think that drink always dulls a man&rsquo;s feelings.
    Some natures are all the more keenly sensitive when alcoholically poisoned.</p>
  <p>Danny was always front man at the shanty while his cheque was fresh&mdash;at
    least, so he was given to understand, and so he apparently understood. He
    was then allowed to say and do what he liked almost, even to mauling the
    barmaid about. There was scarcely any limit to the free and easy manner in
    which you could treat her, so long as your money lasted. She wouldn&rsquo;t
    be offended; it wasn&rsquo;t business to be so&mdash;&ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
    pay.&rdquo; But, as soon as your title to the cheque could be decently shelved,
    you had to treat her like a lady. Danny knew this&mdash;none better; but
    he had been treated with too much latitude, and rushed to his destruction.</p>
  <p>It was Sunday afternoon, but that made no difference in things at the shanty.
    Dinner was just over. The men were in the mean little parlour off the bar,
    interested in a game of cards, and Alice sat in one corner sewing. Danny
    was &ldquo;acting the goat&rdquo; round the fireplace; as ill-luck would
    have it, his attention was drawn to a basket of clean linen which stood on
    the side table, and from it, with sundry winks and grimaces, he gingerly
    lifted a certain garment of ladies&rsquo; underwear&mdash;to put the matter
    decently. He held it up between his forefingers and thumbs, and cracked a
    rough, foolish joke&mdash;no matter what it was. The laugh didn&rsquo;t last
    long. Alice sprang to her feet, flinging her work aside, and struck a stage
    attitude&mdash;her right arm thrown out and the forefinger pointing rigidly,
    and rather crookedly, towards the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leave the room!&rdquo; she snapped at Danny. &ldquo;Leave the room!
    How dare you talk like that before me-e-ee!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Danny made a step and paused irresolutely. He was sober enough to feel the
    humiliation of his position, and having once been a man of spirit, and having
    still the remnants of manhood about him, he did feel it. He gave one pitiful,
    appealing look at her face, but saw no mercy there. She stamped her foot
    again, jabbed her forefinger at the door, and said, &ldquo;Go-o-o!&rdquo; in
    a tone that startled the majority of the company nearly as much as it did
    Danny. Then Yankee Jack threw down his cards, rose from the table, laid his
    strong, shapely right hand&mdash;not roughly&mdash;on Danny&rsquo;s ragged
    shoulder, and engineered the drunk gently through the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;s better go out for a while, Danny,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there
    wasn&rsquo;t much harm in what you said, but your cheque&rsquo;s gone, and
    that makes all the difference. It&rsquo;s time you went back to the station.
    You&rsquo;ve got to be careful what you say now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Jack returned to the parlour the barmaid had a smile for him; but he
    didn&rsquo;t take it. He went and stood before the fire, with his foot resting
    on the fender and his elbow on the mantelshelf, and looked blackly at a print
    against the wall before his face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old beast!&rdquo; said Alice, referring to Danny. &ldquo;He ought
    to be kicked off the place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>He&rsquo;s as good as you!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The voice was Jack&rsquo;s; he flung the stab over his shoulder, and with
    it a look that carried all the contempt he felt.</p>
  <p>She gasped, looked blankly from face to face, and witheringly at the back
    of Jack&rsquo;s head; but that didn&rsquo;t change colour or curl the least
    trifle less closely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you hear that?&rdquo; she cried, appealing to anyone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    a nice lot o&rsquo; men, you are, to sit there and hear a woman insulted,
    and not one of you man enough to take her part&mdash;cowards!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Sydney jackeroo rose impulsively, but Jack glanced at him, and he sat
    down again. She covered her face with her hands and ran hysterically to her
    room.</p>
  <p>That afternoon another bushman arrived with a cheque, and shouted five times
    running at a pound a shout, and at intervals during the rest of the day when
    they weren&rsquo;t fighting or gambling.</p>
  <p>Alice had &ldquo;got over her temper&rdquo; seemingly, and was even kind
    to the humble and contrite Danny, who became painfully particular with his  &ldquo;Thanky,
    Alice&rdquo;&mdash;and afterwards offensive with his unnecessarily frequent
    threats to smash the first man who insulted her.</p>
  <p>But let us draw the curtain close before that Sunday afternoon at Stiffner&rsquo;s,
    and hold it tight. Behind it the great curse of the West is in evidence,
    the chief trouble of unionism&mdash;drink, in its most selfish, barren, and
    useless form.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>All was quiet at Stiffner&rsquo;s. It was after midnight, and Stiffner lay
    dead-drunk on the broad of his back on the long moonlit verandah, with all
    his patrons asleep around him in various grotesque positions. Stiffner&rsquo;s
    ragged grey head was on a cushion, and a broad maudlin smile on his red,
    drink-sodden face, the lower half of which was bordered by a dirty grey beard,
    like that of a frilled lizard. The red handkerchief twisted round his neck
    had a ghastly effect in the bright moonlight, making him look as if his throat
    was cut. The smile was the one he went to sleep with when his wife slipped
    the cushion under his head and thoughtfully removed the loose change from
    about his person. Near him lay a heap that was Danny, and spread over the
    bare boards were the others, some with heads pillowed on their swags, and
    every man about as drunk as his neighbour. Yankee Jack lay across the door
    of the barmaid&rsquo;s bedroom, with one arm bent under his head, the other
    lying limp on the doorstep, his handsome face turned out to the bright moonlight.
    The &ldquo;family&rdquo; were sound asleep in the detached cottage, and Alice&mdash;the
    only capable person on the premises&mdash;was left to put out the lamps and &ldquo;shut
    up&rdquo; for the night. She extinguished the light in the bar, came out,
    locked the door, and picked her way among and over the drunkards to the end
    of the verandah. She clasped her hands behind her head, stretched herself,
    and yawned, and then stood for a few moments looking out into the night,
    which softened the ragged line of mulga to right and left, and veiled the
    awful horizon of that great plain with which the &ldquo;traveller&rdquo;  commenced,
    or ended, the thirty-mile &ldquo;dry stretch&rdquo;. Then she moved towards
    her own door; before it she halted and stood, with folded arms, looking down
    at the drunken Adonis at her feet.</p>
  <p>She breathed a long breath with a sigh in it, went round to the back, and
    presently returned with a buggy-cushion, which she slipped under his head&mdash;her
    face close to his&mdash;very close. Then she moved his arms gently off the
    threshold, stepped across him into her room, and locked the door behind her.</p>
  <p>There was an uneasy movement in the heap that stood, or lay, for Danny.
    It stretched out, turned over, struggled to its hands and knees, and became
    an object. Then it crawled to the wall, against which it slowly and painfully
    up-ended itself, and stood blinking round for the water-bag, which hung from
    the verandah rafters in a line with its shapeless red nose. It staggered
    forward, held on by the cords, felt round the edge of the bag for the tot,
    and drank about a quart of water. Then it staggered back against the wall,
    stood for a moment muttering and passing its hand aimlessly over its poor
    ruined head, and finally collapsed into a shapeless rum-smelling heap and
    slept once more.</p>
  <p>The jackeroo at the end of the verandah had awakened from his drunken sleep,
    but had not moved. He lay huddled on his side, with his head on the swag;
    the whole length of the verandah was before him; his eyes were wide open,
    but his face was in the shade. Now he rose painfully and stood on the ground
    outside, with his hands in his pockets, and gazed out over the open for a
    while. He breathed a long breath, too&mdash;with a groan in it. Then he lifted
    his swag quietly from the end of the floor, shouldered it, took up his water-bag
    and billy, and sneaked over the road, away from the place, like a thief.
    He struck across the plain, and tramped on, hour after hour, mile after mile,
    till the bright moon went down with a bright star in attendance and the other
    bright stars waned, and he entered the timber and tramped through it to the &ldquo;cleared
    road&rdquo;, which stretched far and wide for twenty miles before him, with
    ghostly little dust-clouds at short intervals ahead, where the frightened
    rabbits crossed it. And still he went doggedly on, with the ghastly daylight
    on him&mdash;like a swagman&rsquo;s ghost out late. And a mongrel followed
    faithfully all the time unnoticed, and wondering, perhaps, at his master.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was yer doin&rsquo; to that girl yesterday?&rdquo; asked Danny
    of Yankee Jack next evening, as they camped on the far side of the plain. &ldquo;What
    was you chaps sayin&rsquo; to Alice? I heerd her cryin&rsquo; in her room
    last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they reckoned that he had been too drunk to hear anything except an
    invitation to come and have another drink; and so it passed.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHeroofRedclay"></a>The Hero of Redclay</b></h2>
  <p>The &ldquo;boss-over-the-board&rdquo; was leaning with his back to the wall
    between two shoots, reading a reference handed to him by a green-hand applying
    for work as picker-up or woolroller&mdash;a shed rouseabout. It was terribly
    hot. I was slipping past to the rolling-tables, carrying three fleeces to
    save a journey; we were only supposed to carry two. The boss stopped me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got three fleeces there, young man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Notwithstanding the fact that I had just slipped a light ragged fleece into
    the belly-wool and &ldquo;bits&rdquo; basket, I felt deeply injured, and
    righteously and fiercely indignant at being pulled up. It was a fearfully
    hot day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I catch you carrying three fleeces again,&rdquo; said the boss
    quietly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you the sack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it now if you like,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>He nodded. &ldquo;You can go on picking-up in this man&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; he
    said to the jackeroo, whose reference showed him to be a non-union man&mdash;a  &ldquo;free-labourer&rdquo;,
    as the pastoralists had it, or, in plain shed terms, &ldquo;a blanky scab&rdquo;.
    He was now in the comfortable position of a non-unionist in a union shed
    who had jumped into a sacked man&rsquo;s place.</p>
  <p>Somehow the lurid sympathy of the men irritated me worse than the boss-over-the-board
    had done. It must have been on account of the heat, as Mitchell says. I was
    sick of the shed and the life. It was within a couple of days of cut-out,
    so I told Mitchell&mdash;who was shearing&mdash;that I&rsquo;d camp up the
    Billabong and wait for him; got my cheque, rolled up my swag, got three days&rsquo;  tucker
    from the cook, said so-long to him, and tramped while the men were in the
    shed.</p>
  <p>I camped at the head of the Billabong where the track branched, one branch
    running to Bourke, up the river, and the other out towards the Paroo&mdash;and
    hell.</p>
  <p>About ten o&rsquo;clock the third morning Mitchell came along with his cheque
    and his swag, and a new sheep-pup, and his quiet grin; and I wasn&rsquo;t
    too pleased to see that he had a shearer called &ldquo;the Lachlan&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>The Lachlan wasn&rsquo;t popular at the shed. He was a brooding, unsociable
    sort of man, and it didn&rsquo;t make any difference to the chaps whether
    he had a union ticket or not. It was pretty well known in the shed&mdash;there
    were three or four chaps from the district he was reared in&mdash;that he&rsquo;d
    done five years hard for burglary. What surprised me was that Jack Mitchell
    seemed thick with him; often, when the Lachlan was sitting brooding and smoking
    by himself outside the hut after sunset, Mitchell would perch on his heels
    alongside him and yarn. But no one else took notice of anything Mitchell
    did out of the common.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better camp with us till the cool of the evening,&rdquo; said Mitchell
    to the Lachlan, as they slipped their swags. &ldquo;Plenty time for you to
    start after sundown, if you&rsquo;re going to travel to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So the Lachlan was going to travel all night and on a different track. I
    felt more comfortable, and put the billy on. I did not care so much what
    he&rsquo;d been or had done, but I was green and soft yet, and his presence
    embarrassed me.</p>
  <p>They talked shearing, sheds, tracks, and a little unionism&mdash;the Lachlan
    speaking in a quiet voice and with a lot of sound, common sense, it seemed
    to me. He was tall and gaunt, and might have been thirty, or even well on
    in the forties. His eyes were dark brown and deep set, and had something
    of the dead-earnest sad expression you saw in the eyes of union leaders and
    secretaries&mdash;the straight men of the strikes of &rsquo;90 and &rsquo;91.
    I fancied once or twice I saw in his eyes the sudden furtive look of the &ldquo;bad
    egg&rdquo; when a mounted trooper is spotted near the shed; but perhaps this
    was prejudice. And with it all there was about the Lachlan something of the
    man who has lost all he had and the chances of all he was ever likely to
    have, and is past feeling, or caring, or flaring up&mdash;past getting mad
    about anything&mdash;something, all the same, that warned men not to make
    free with him.</p>
  <p>He and Mitchell fished along the Billabong all the afternoon; I fished a
    little, and lay about the camp and read. I had an instinct that the Lachlan
    saw I didn&rsquo;t cotton on to his camping with us, though he wasn&rsquo;t
    the sort of man to show what he saw or felt. After tea, and a smoke at sunset,
    he shouldered his swag, nodded to me as if I was an accidental but respectful
    stranger at a funeral that belonged to him, and took the outside track. Mitchell
    walked along the track with him for a mile or so, while I poked round and
    got some boughs down for a bed, and fed and studied the collie pup that Jack
    had bought from the shearers&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>I saw them stop and shake hands out on the dusty clearing, and they seemed
    to take a long time about it; then Mitchell started back, and the other began
    to dwindle down to a black peg and then to a dot on the sandy plain, that
    had just a hint of dusk and dreamy far-away gloaming on it between the change
    from glaring day to hard, bare, broad moonlight.</p>
  <p>I thought Mitchell was sulky, or had got the blues, when he came back; he
    lay on his elbow smoking, with his face turned from the camp towards the
    plain. After a bit I got wild&mdash;if Mitchell was going to go on like that
    he might as well have taken his swag and gone with the Lachlan. I don&rsquo;t
    know exactly what was the matter with me that day, and at last I made up
    my mind to bring the thing to a head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem mighty thick with the Lachlan,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s the matter with that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t the first felon I&rsquo;ve been on speaking terms with. I borrowed
    half-a-caser off a murderer once, when I was in a hole and had no one else
    to go to; and the murderer hadn&rsquo;t served his time, neither. I&rsquo;ve
    got nothing against the Lachlan, except that he&rsquo;s a white man and bears
    a faint family resemblance to a certain branch of my tribe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I rolled out my swag on the boughs, got my pipe, tobacco, and matches handy
    in the crown of a spare hat, and lay down.</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, re-lit his pipe at the fire, and mooned round for a while,
    with his hands behind him, kicking sticks out of the road, looking out over
    the plain, down along the Billabong, and up through the mulga branches at
    the stars; then he comforted the pup a bit, shoved the fire together with
    his toe, stood the tea-billy on the coals, and came and squatted on the sand
    by my head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe! I&rsquo;ll tell you a yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; fire away! Has it got anything to do with the Lachlan?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the Lachlan now; but it&rsquo;s
    about a chap he knew. Don&rsquo;t you ever breathe a word of this to the
    Lachlan or anyone, or he&rsquo;ll get on to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right. Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve been a good many things in my time. I did a deal
    of house-painting at one time; I was a pretty smart brush hand, and made
    money at it. Well, I had a run of work at a place called Redclay, on the
    Lachlan side. You know the sort of town&mdash;two pubs, a general store,
    a post office, a blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, a police station, a branch bank,
    and a dozen private weatherboard boxes on piles, with galvanized-iron tops,
    besides the humpies. There was a paper there, too, called the &lsquo;Redclay
    Advertiser&rsquo; (with which was incorporated the &lsquo;Geebung Chronicle&rsquo;),
    and a Roman Catholic church, a Church of England, and a Wesleyan chapel.
    Now you see more of private life in the house-painting line than in any other&mdash;bar
    plumbing and gasfitting; but I&rsquo;ll tell you about my house-painting
    experiences some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a young chap named Jack Drew editing the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  then.
    He belonged to the district, but had been sent to Sydney to a grammar school
    when he was a boy. He was between twenty-five and thirty; had knocked round
    a good deal, and gone the pace in Sydney. He got on as a boy reporter on
    one of the big dailies; he had brains and could write rings round a good
    many, but he got in with a crowd that called themselves &lsquo;Bohemians&rsquo;,
    and the drink got a hold on him. The paper stuck to him as long as it could
    (for the sake of his brains), but they had to sack him at last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He went out back, as most of them do, to try and work out their salvation,
    and knocked round amongst the sheds. He &lsquo;picked up&rsquo; in one shed
    where I was shearing, and we carried swags together for a couple of months.
    Then he went back to the Lachlan side, and prospected amongst the old fields
    round there with his elder brother Tom, who was all there was left of his
    family. Tom, by the way, broke his heart digging Jack out of a cave in a
    drive they were working, and died a few minutes after the rescue. (See &ldquo;When
    the Sun Went Down&rdquo;, in &ldquo;While the Billy Boils&rdquo;) But that&rsquo;s
    another yarn. Jack Drew had a bad spree after that; then he went to Sydney
    again, got on his old paper, went to the dogs, and a Parliamentary push that
    owned some city fly-blisters and country papers sent him up to edit the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  at
    two quid a week. He drank again, and no wonder&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know
    what it is to run a &lsquo;Geebung Advocate&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mudgee Budgee
    Chronicle&rsquo;, and live there. He was about the same build as the Lachlan,
    but stouter, and had something the same kind of eyes; but he was ordinarily
    as careless and devil-may-care as the Lachlan is grumpy and quiet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a doctor there, called Dr. Lebinski. They said he was a
    Polish exile. He was fifty or sixty, a tall man, with the set of an old soldier
    when he stood straight; but he mostly walked with his hands behind him, studying
    the ground. Jack Drew caught that trick off him towards the end. They were
    chums in a gloomy way, and kept to themselves&mdash;they were the only two
    men with brains in that town. They drank and fought the drink together. The
    Doctor was too gloomy and impatient over little things to be popular. Jack
    Drew talked too straight in the paper, and in spite of his proprietors&mdash;about
    pub spieling and such things&mdash;and was too sarcastic in his progress
    committee, town council, and toady reception reports. The Doctor had a hawk&rsquo;s
    nose, pointed grizzled beard and moustache, and steely-grey eyes with a haunted
    look in them sometimes (especially when he glanced at you sideways), as if
    he loathed his fellow men, and couldn&rsquo;t always hide it; or as if you
    were the spirit of morphia or opium, or a dead girl he&rsquo;d wronged in
    his youth&mdash;or whatever his devil was, beside drink. He was clever, and
    drink had brought him down to Redclay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The bank manager was a heavy snob named Browne. He complained of
    being a bit dull of hearing in one ear&mdash;after you&rsquo;d yelled at
    him three or four times; sometimes I&rsquo;ve thought he was as deaf as a
    book-keeper in both. He had a wife and youngsters, but they were away on
    a visit while I was working in Redclay. His niece&mdash;or, rather, his wife&rsquo;s
    niece&mdash;a girl named Ruth Wilson, did the housekeeping. She was an orphan,
    adopted by her aunt, and was general slavey and scape-goat to the family&mdash;especially
    to the brats, as is often the case. She was rather pretty, and lady-like,
    and kept to herself. The women and girls called her Miss Wilson, and didn&rsquo;t
    like her. Most of the single men&mdash;and some of the married ones, perhaps&mdash;were
    gone on her, but hadn&rsquo;t the brains or the pluck to bear up and try
    their luck. I was gone worse than any, I think, but had too much experience
    or common sense. She was very good to me&mdash;used to hand me out cups of
    tea and plates of sandwiches, or bread and butter, or cake, mornings and
    afternoons the whole time I was painting the bank. The Doctor had known her
    people and was very kind to her. She was about the only woman&mdash;for she
    was more woman than girl&mdash;that he&rsquo;d brighten up and talk for.
    Neither he nor Jack Drew were particularly friendly with Browne or his push.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The banker, the storekeeper, one of the publicans, the butcher (a
    popular man with his hands in his pockets, his hat on the back of his head,
    and nothing in it), the postmaster, and his toady, the lightning squirter,
    were the scrub-aristocracy. The rest were crawlers, mostly pub spielers and
    bush larrikins, and the women were hags and larrikinesses. The town lived
    on cheque-men from the surrounding bush. It was a nice little place, taking
    it all round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember a ball at the local town hall, where the scrub aristocrats
    took one end of the room to dance in and the ordinary scum the other. It
    was a saving in music. Some day an Australian writer will come along who&rsquo;ll
    remind the critics and readers of Dickens, Carlyle, and Thackeray mixed,
    and he&rsquo;ll do justice to these little customs of ours in the little
    settled-district towns of Democratic Australia. This sort of thing came to
    a head one New Year&rsquo;s Night at Redclay, when there was a &lsquo;public&rsquo; ball
    and peace on earth and good will towards all men&mdash;mostly on account
    of a railway to Redclay being surveyed. We were all there. They&rsquo;d got
    the Doc. out of his shell to act as M.C.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One of the aristocrats was the daughter of the local storekeeper;
    she belonged to the lawn-tennis clique, and they <i>were</i> select. For
    some reason or other&mdash;because she looked upon Miss Wilson as a slavey,
    or on account of a fancied slight, or the heat working on ignorance, or on
    account of something that comes over girls and women that no son of sin can
    account for&mdash;this Miss Tea-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-sugar tossed her head and
    refused Miss Wilson&rsquo;s hand in the first set and so broke the ladies&rsquo; chain
    and the dance. Then there was a to-do. The Doctor held up his hand to stop
    the music, and said, very quietly, that he must call upon Miss So-and-so
    to apologise to Miss Wilson&mdash;or resign the chair. After a lot of fuss
    the girl did apologise in a snappy way that was another insult. Jack Drew
    gave Miss Wilson his arm and marched her off without a word&mdash;I saw she
    was almost crying. Some one said, &lsquo;Oh, let&rsquo;s go on with the dance.&rsquo; The
    Doctor flashed round on them, but they were too paltry for him, so he turned
    on his heel and went out without a word. But I was beneath them again in
    social standing, so there was nothing to prevent me from making a few well-chosen
    remarks on things in general&mdash;which I did; and broke up that ball, and
    broke some heads afterwards, and got myself a good deal of hatred and respect,
    and two sweethearts; and lost all the jobs I was likely to get, except at
    the bank, the Doctor&rsquo;s, and the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One day it was raining&mdash;general rain for a week. Rain, rain,
    rain, over ridge and scrub and galvanised iron and into the dismal creeks.
    I&rsquo;d done all my inside work, except a bit under the Doctor&rsquo;s
    verandah, where he&rsquo;d been having some patching and altering done round
    the glass doors of his surgery, where he consulted his patients. I didn&rsquo;t
    want to lose time. It was a Monday and no day for the Royal, and there was
    no dust, so it was a good day for varnishing. I took a pot and brush and
    went along to give the Doctor&rsquo;s doors a coat of varnish. The Doctor
    and Drew were inside with a fire, drinking whisky and smoking, but I didn&rsquo;t
    know that when I started work. The rain roared on the iron roof like the
    sea. All of a sudden it held up for a minute, and I heard their voices. The
    doctor had been shouting on account of the rain, and forgot to lower his
    voice. &lsquo;Look here, Jack Drew,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;there are only
    two things for you to do if you have any regard for that girl; one is to
    stop this&rsquo; (the liquor I suppose he meant) &lsquo;and pull yourself
    together; and I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll do that&mdash;I know men.
    The other is to throw up the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s doing
    you no good&mdash;and clear out.&rsquo; &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; says
    Drew. &lsquo;Then shoot yourself,&rsquo; said the Doctor. &lsquo;(There&rsquo;s
    another flask in the cupboard). You know what this hole is like.... She&rsquo;s
    a good true girl&mdash;a girl as God made her. I knew her father and mother,
    and I tell you, Jack, I&rsquo;d sooner see her dead than....&rsquo; The roof
    roared again. I felt a bit delicate about the business and didn&rsquo;t like
    to disturb them, so I knocked off for the day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a week before that I was down in the bed of the Redclay Creek
    fishing for &lsquo;tailers&rsquo;. I&rsquo;d been getting on all right with
    the housemaid at the &lsquo;Royal&rsquo;&mdash;she used to have plates of
    pudding and hot pie for me on the big gridiron arrangement over the kitchen
    range; and after the third tuck-out I thought it was good enough to do a
    bit of a bear-up in that direction. She mentioned one day, yarning, that
    she liked a stroll by the creek sometimes in the cool of the evening. I thought
    she&rsquo;d be off that day, so I said I&rsquo;d go for a fish after I&rsquo;d
    knocked off. I thought I might get a bite. Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t catch Lizzie&mdash;tell
    you about that some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was Sunday. I&rsquo;d been fishing for Lizzie about an hour when
    I saw a skirt on the bank out of the tail of my eye&mdash;and thought I&rsquo;d
    got a bite, sure. But I was had. It was Miss Wilson strolling along the bank
    in the sunset, all by her pretty self. She was a slight girl, not very tall,
    with reddish frizzled hair, grey eyes, and small, pretty features. She spoke
    as if she had more brains than the average, and had been better educated.
    Jack Drew was the only young man in Redclay she could talk to, or who could
    talk to a girl like her; and that was the whole trouble in a nutshell. The
    newspaper office was next to the bank, and I&rsquo;d seen her hand cups of
    tea and cocoa over the fence to his office window more than once, and sometimes
    they yarned for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;Good morning, Mr. Mitchell.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Good morning, Miss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some girls I can&rsquo;t talk to like I&rsquo;d talk
    to other girls. She asked me if I&rsquo;d caught any fish, and I said, &lsquo;No,
    Miss.&rsquo; She asked me if it wasn&rsquo;t me down there fishing with Mr.
    Drew the other evening, and I said, &lsquo;Yes&mdash;it was me.&rsquo; Then
    presently she asked me straight if he was fishing down the creek that afternoon?
    I guessed they&rsquo;d been down fishing for each other before. I said, &lsquo;No,
    I thought he was out of town.&rsquo; I knew he was pretty bad at the Royal.
    I asked her if she&rsquo;d like to have a try with my line, but she said
    No, thanks, she must be going; and she went off up the creek. I reckoned
    Jack Drew had got a bite and landed her. I felt a bit sorry for her, too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The next Saturday evening after the rainy Monday at the Doctor&rsquo;s,
    I went down to fish for tailers&mdash;and Lizzie. I went down under the banks
    to where there was a big she-oak stump half in the water, going quietly,
    with an idea of not frightening the fish. I was just unwinding the line from
    my rod, when I noticed the end of another rod sticking out from the other
    side of the stump; and while I watched it was dropped into the water. Then
    I heard a murmur, and craned my neck round the back of the stump to see who
    it was. I saw the back view of Jack Drew and Miss Wilson; he had his arm
    round her waist, and her head was on his shoulder. She said, &lsquo;I <i>will</i> trust
    you, Jack&mdash;I know you&rsquo;ll give up the drink for my sake. And I&rsquo;ll
    help you, and we&rsquo;ll be so happy!&rsquo; or words in that direction.
    A thunderstorm was coming on. The sky had darkened up with a great blue-black
    storm-cloud rushing over, and they hadn&rsquo;t noticed it. I didn&rsquo;t
    mind, and the fish bit best in a storm. But just as she said &lsquo;happy&rsquo; came
    a blinding flash and a crash that shook the ridges, and the first drops came
    peltering down. They jumped up and climbed the bank, while I perched on the
    she-oak roots over the water to be out of sight as they passed. Half way
    to the town I saw them standing in the shelter of an old stone chimney that
    stood alone. He had his overcoat round her and was sheltering her from the
    wind....&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Smoke-oh, Joe. The tea&rsquo;s stewing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell got up, stretched himself, and brought the billy and pint-pots
    to the head of my camp. The moon had grown misty. The plain horizon had closed
    in. A couple of boughs, hanging from the gnarled and blasted timber over
    the billabong, were the perfect shapes of two men hanging side by side. Mitchell
    scratched the back of his neck and looked down at the pup curled like a glob
    of mud on the sand in the moonlight, and an idea struck him. He got a big
    old felt hat he had, lifted his pup, nose to tail, fitted it in the hat,
    shook it down, holding the hat by the brim, and stood the hat near the head
    of his doss, out of the moonlight. &ldquo;He might get moonstruck,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t want that pup to be a genius.&rdquo; The
    pup seemed perfectly satisfied with this new arrangement.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have a smoke,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he added,
    with a sly grin, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to make up the yarn as I go along,
    and it&rsquo;s hard work. It seems to begin to remind me of yarns your grandmother
    or aunt tells of things that happened when she was a girl&mdash;but those
    yarns are true. You won&rsquo;t have to listen long now; I&rsquo;m well on
    into the second volume.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After the storm I hurried home to the tent&mdash;I was batching with
    a carpenter. I changed my clothes, made a fire in the fire-bucket with shavings
    and ends of soft wood, boiled the billy, and had a cup of coffee. It was
    Saturday night. My mate was at the Royal; it was cold and dismal in the tent,
    and there was nothing to read, so I reckoned I might as well go up to the
    Royal, too, and put in the time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I had to pass the Bank on the way. It was the usual weatherboard
    box with a galvanised iron top&mdash;four rooms and a passage, and a detached
    kitchen and wash-house at the back; the front room to the right (behind the
    office) was the family bedroom, and the one opposite it was the living room.
    The &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;  office was next door. Jack Drew camped in a
    skillion room behind his printing office, and had his meals at the Royal.
    I noticed the storm had taken a sheet of iron off the skillion, and supposed
    he&rsquo;d sleep at the Royal that night. Next to the &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo; office
    was the police station (still called the Police Camp) and the Courthouse.
    Next was the Imperial Hotel, where the scrub aristocrats went. There was
    a vacant allotment on the other side of the Bank, and I took a short cut
    across this to the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d forgotten to pull down the blind of the dining-room
    window, and I happened to glance through and saw she had Jack Drew in there
    and was giving him a cup of tea. He had a bad cold, I remember, and I suppose
    his health had got precious to her, poor girl. As I glanced she stepped to
    the window and pulled down the blind, which put me out of face a bit&mdash;though,
    of course, she hadn&rsquo;t seen me. I was rather surprised at her having
    Jack in there, till I heard that the banker, the postmaster, the constable,
    and some others were making a night of it at the Imperial, as they&rsquo;d
    been doing pretty often lately&mdash;and went on doing till there was a blow-up
    about it, and the constable got transferred Out Back. I used to drink my
    share then. We smoked and played cards and yarned and filled &rsquo;em up
    again at the Royal till after one in the morning. Then I started home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d finished giving the Bank a couple of coats of stone-colour
    that week, and was cutting in in dark colour round the spouting, doors, and
    window-frames that Saturday. My head was pretty clear going home, and as
    I passed the place it struck me that I&rsquo;d left out the only varnish
    brush I had. I&rsquo;d been using it to give the sashes a coat of varnish
    colour, and remembered that I&rsquo;d left it on one of the window-sills&mdash;the
    sill of her bedroom window, as it happened. I knew I&rsquo;d sleep in next
    day, Sunday, and guessed it would be hot, and I didn&rsquo;t want the varnish
    tool to get spoiled; so I reckoned I&rsquo;d slip in through the side gate,
    get it, and take it home to camp and put it in oil. The window sash was jammed,
    I remember, and I hadn&rsquo;t been able to get it up more than a couple
    of inches to paint the runs of the sash. The grass grew up close under the
    window, and I slipped in quietly. I noticed the sash was still up a couple
    of inches. Just as I grabbed the brush I heard low voices inside&mdash;Ruth
    Wilson&rsquo;s and Jack Drew&rsquo;s&mdash;in her room.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The surprise sent about a pint of beer up into my throat in a lump.
    I tip-toed away out of there. Just as I got clear of the gate I saw the banker
    being helped home by a couple of cronies.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I went home to the camp and turned in, but I couldn&rsquo;t sleep.
    I lay think&mdash;think&mdash;thinking, till I thought all the drink out
    of my head. I&rsquo;d brought a bottle of ale home to last over Sunday, and
    I drank that. It only made matters worse. I didn&rsquo;t know how I felt&mdash;I&mdash;well,
    I felt as if I was as good a man as Jack Drew&mdash;I&mdash;you see I&rsquo;ve&mdash;you
    might think it soft&mdash;but I loved that girl, not as I&rsquo;ve been gone
    on other girls, but in the old-fashioned, soft, honest, hopeless, far-away
    sort of way; and now, to tell the straight truth, I thought I might have
    had her. You lose a thing through being too straight or sentimental, or not
    having enough cheek; and another man comes along with more brass in his blood
    and less sentimental rot and takes it up&mdash;and the world respects him;
    and you feel in your heart that you&rsquo;re a weaker man than he is. Why,
    part of the time I must have felt like a man does when a better man runs
    away with his wife. But I&rsquo;d drunk a lot, and was upset and lonely-feeling
    that night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, but Redclay had a tremendous sensation next day! Jack Drew, of
    all the men in the world, had been caught in the act of robbing the bank.
    According to Browne&rsquo;s account in court and in the newspapers, he returned
    home that night at about twelve o&rsquo;clock (which I knew was a lie, for
    I saw him being helped home nearer two) and immediately retired to rest (on
    top of the quilt, boots and all, I suppose). Some time before daybreak he
    was roused by a fancied noise (I suppose it was his head swelling); he rose,
    turned up a night lamp (he hadn&rsquo;t lit it, I&rsquo;ll swear), and went
    through the dining-room passage and office to investigate (for whisky and
    water). He saw that the doors and windows were secure, returned to bed, and
    fell asleep again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is something in a deaf person&rsquo;s being roused easily.
    I know the case of a deaf chap who&rsquo;d start up at a step or movement
    in the house when no one else could hear or feel it; keen sense of vibration,
    I reckon. Well, just at daybreak (to shorten the yarn) the banker woke suddenly,
    he said, and heard a crack like a shot in the house. There was a loose flooring-board
    in the passage that went off like a pistol-shot sometimes when you trod on
    it; and I guess Jack Drew trod on it, sneaking out, and he weighed nearly
    twelve stone. If the truth were known, he probably heard Browne poking round,
    tried the window, found the sash jammed, and was slipping through the passage
    to the back door. Browne got his revolver, opened his door suddenly, and
    caught Drew standing between the girl&rsquo;s door (which was shut) and the
    office door, with his coat on his arm and his boots in his hands. Browne
    covered him with his revolver, swore he&rsquo;d shoot if he moved, and yelled
    for help. Drew stood a moment like a man stunned; then he rushed Browne,
    and in the struggle the revolver went off, and Drew got hit in the arm. Two
    of the mounted troopers&mdash;who&rsquo;d been up looking to the horses for
    an early start somewhere&mdash;rushed in then, and took Drew. He had nothing
    to say. What could he say? He couldn&rsquo;t say he was a blackguard who&rsquo;d
    taken advantage of a poor unprotected girl because she loved him. They found
    the back door unlocked, by the way, which was put down to the burglar; of
    course Browne couldn&rsquo;t explain that he came home too muddled to lock
    doors after him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the girl? She shrieked and fell when the row started, and they
    found her like a log on the floor of her room after it was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They found in Jack&rsquo;s overcoat pocket a parcel containing a
    cold chisel, small screw-wrench, file, and one or two other things that he&rsquo;d
    bought that evening to tinker up the old printing press. I knew that, because
    I&rsquo;d lent him a hand a few nights before, and he told me he&rsquo;d
    have to get the tools. They found some scratches round the key-hole and knob
    of the office door that I&rsquo;d made myself, scraping old splashes of paint
    off the brass and hand-plate so as to make a clean finish. Oh, it taught
    me the value of circumstantial evidence! If I was judge I wouldn&rsquo;t
    give a man till the &lsquo;risin&rsquo; av the coort&rsquo; on it, any more
    than I would on the bare word of the noblest woman breathing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At the preliminary examination Jack Drew said he was guilty. But
    it seemed that, according to law, he couldn&rsquo;t be guilty until after
    he was committed. So he was committed for trial at the next Quarter Sessions.
    The excitement and gabble were worse than the Dean case, or Federation, and
    sickened me, for they were all on the wrong track. You lose a lot of life
    through being behind the scenes. But they cooled down presently to wait for
    the trial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They thought it best to take the girl away from the place where she&rsquo;d
    got the shock; so the Doctor took her to his house, where he had an old housekeeper
    who was as deaf as a post&mdash;a first class recommendation for a housekeeper
    anywhere. He got a nurse from Sydney to attend on Ruth Wilson, and no one
    except he and the nurse were allowed to go near her. She lay like dead, they
    said, except when she had to be held down raving; brain fever, they said,
    brought on by the shock of the attempted burglary and pistol shot. Dr. Lebinski
    had another doctor up from Sydney at his own expense, but nothing could save
    her&mdash;and perhaps it was as well. She might have finished her life in
    a lunatic asylum. They were going to send her to Sydney, to a brain hospital;
    but she died a week before the Sessions. She was right-headed for an hour,
    they said, and asking all the time for Jack. The Doctor told her he was all
    right and was coming&mdash;and, waiting and listening for him, she died.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The case was black enough against Drew now. I knew he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have the pluck to tell the truth now, even if he was that sort of a man.
    I didn&rsquo;t know what to do, so I spoke to the Doctor straight. I caught
    him coming out of the Royal, and walked along the road with him a bit. I
    suppose he thought I was going to show cause why his doors ought to have
    another coat of varnish.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hallo, Mitchell!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s painting?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Doctor!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what am I going to do about
    this business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What business?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Jack Drew&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He looked at me sideways&mdash;the swift haunted look. Then he walked
    on without a word, for half a dozen yards, hands behind, and studying the
    dust. Then he asked, quite quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Do you know the truth?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About a dozen yards this time; then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll see him in the morning, and see you afterwards,&rsquo; and
    he shook hands and went on home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Next day he came to me where I was doing a job on a step ladder.
    He leaned his elbow against the steps for a moment, and rubbed his hand over
    his forehead, as if it ached and he was tired.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him, Mitchell,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You were mates with him, once, Out Back?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I was.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You know Drew&rsquo;s hand-writing?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I should think so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He laid a leaf from a pocketbook on top of the steps. I read the
    message written in pencil:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To Jack Mitchell.&mdash;We were mates on the track. If you
    know anything of my affair, don&rsquo;t give it away.&mdash;J. D.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I tore the leaf and dropped the bits into the paint-pot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Doctor,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but
    is there no way?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;None.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He turned away, wearily. He&rsquo;d knocked about so much over the
    world that he was past bothering about explaining things or being surprised
    at anything. But he seemed to get a new idea about me; he came back to the
    steps again, and watched my brush for a while, as if he was thinking, in
    a broody sort of way, of throwing up his practice and going in for house-painting.
    Then he said, slowly and deliberately:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If she&mdash;the girl&mdash;had lived, we might have tried
    to fix it up quietly. That&rsquo;s what I was hoping for. I don&rsquo;t see
    how we can help him now, even if he&rsquo;d let us. He would never have spoken,
    anyway. We must let it go on, and after the trial I&rsquo;ll go to Sydney
    and see what I can do at headquarters. It&rsquo;s too late now. You understand,
    Mitchell?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes. I&rsquo;ve thought it out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he went away towards the Royal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what could Jack Drew or we do? Study it out whatever way you
    like. There was only one possible chance to help him, and that was to go
    to the judge; and the judge that happened to be on that circuit was a man
    who&mdash;even if he did listen to the story and believe it&mdash;would have
    felt inclined to give Jack all the more for what he was charged with. Browne
    was out of the question. The day before the trial I went for a long walk
    in the bush, but couldn&rsquo;t hit on anything that the Doctor might have
    missed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was in the court&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t keep away. The Doctor was
    there too. There wasn&rsquo;t so much of a change in Jack as I expected,
    only he had the gaol white in his face already. He stood fingering the rail,
    as if it was the edge of a table on a platform and he was a tired and bored
    and sleepy chairman waiting to propose a vote of thanks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The only well-known man in Australia who reminds me of Mitchell is Bland
    Holt, the comedian. Mitchell was about as good hearted as Bland Holt, too,
    under it all; but he was bigger and roughened by the bush. But he seemed
    to be taking a heavy part to-night, for, towards the end of his yarn, he
    got up and walked up and down the length of my bed, dropping the sentences
    as he turned towards me. He&rsquo;d folded his arms high and tight, and his
    face in the moonlight was&mdash;well, it was very different from his careless
    tone of voice. He was like&mdash;like an actor acting tragedy and talking
    comedy. Mitchell went on, speaking quickly&mdash;his voice seeming to harden:</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;The charge was read out&mdash;I forget how it went&mdash;it sounded
    like a long hymn being given out. Jack pleaded guilty. Then he straightened
    up for the first time and looked round the court, with a calm, disinterested
    look&mdash;as if we were all strangers and he was noting the size of the
    meeting. And&mdash;it&rsquo;s a funny world, ain&rsquo;t it?&mdash;everyone
    of us shifted or dropped his eyes, just as if we were the felons and Jack
    the judge. Everyone except the Doctor; he looked at Jack and Jack looked
    at him. Then the Doctor smiled&mdash;I can&rsquo;t describe it&mdash;and
    Drew smiled back. It struck me afterwards that I should have been in that
    smile. Then the Doctor did what looked like a strange thing&mdash;stood like
    a soldier with his hands to Attention. I&rsquo;d noticed that, whenever he&rsquo;d
    made up his mind to do a thing, he dropped his hands to his sides: it was
    a sign that he couldn&rsquo;t be moved. Now he slowly lifted his hand to
    his forehead, palm out, saluted the prisoner, turned on his heel, and marched
    from the court-room. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s boozin&rsquo;  again,&rsquo; someone
    whispered. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s got a touch of &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My oath, he&rsquo;s ratty!&rsquo; said someone else. One of the traps
    said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Arder in the car-rt!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The judge gave it to Drew red-hot on account of the burglary being
    the cause of the girl&rsquo;s death and the sorrow in a respectable family;
    then he gave him five years&rsquo; hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It gave me a lot of confidence in myself to see the law of the land
    barking up the wrong tree, while only I and the Doctor and the prisoner knew
    it. But I&rsquo;ve found out since then that the law is often the only one
    that knows it&rsquo;s barking up the wrong tree.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Mitchell prepared to turn in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about Drew,&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, he did his time, or most of it. The Doctor went to headquarters,
    but either a drunken doctor from a geebung town wasn&rsquo;t of much account,
    or they weren&rsquo;t taking any romance just then at headquarters. So the
    Doctor came back, drank heavily, and one frosty morning they found him on
    his back on the bank of the creek, with his face like note-paper where the
    blood hadn&rsquo;t dried on it, and an old pistol in his hand&mdash;that
    he&rsquo;d used, they said, to shoot Cossacks from horseback when he was
    a young dude fighting in the bush in Poland.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lay silent a good while; then he yawned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s a lonely track the Lachlan&rsquo;s tramping
    to-night; but I s&rsquo;pose he&rsquo;s got his ghosts with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been puzzling for the last half-hour to think where I&rsquo;d
    met or heard of Jack Drew; now it flashed on me that I&rsquo;d been told
    that Jack Drew was the Lachlan&rsquo;s real name.</p>
  <p>I lay awake thinking a long time, and wished Mitchell had kept his yarn
    for daytime. I felt&mdash;well, I felt as if the Lachlan&rsquo;s story should
    have been played in the biggest theatre in the world, by the greatest actors,
    with music for the intervals and situations&mdash;deep, strong music, such
    as thrills and lifts a man from his boot soles. And when I got to sleep I
    hadn&rsquo;t slept a moment, it seemed to me, when I started wide awake to
    see those infernal hanging boughs with a sort of nightmare idea that the
    Lachlan hadn&rsquo;t gone, or had come back, and he and Mitchell had hanged
    themselves sociably&mdash;Mitchell for sympathy and the sake of mateship.</p>
  <p>But Mitchell was sleeping peacefully, in spite of a path of moonlight across
    his face&mdash;and so was the pup.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDarlingRiver"></a>The Darling River</b></h2>
  <p>The Darling&mdash;which is either a muddy gutter or a second Mississippi&mdash;is
    about six times as long as the distance, in a straight line, from its head
    to its mouth. The state of the river is vaguely but generally understood
    to depend on some distant and foreign phenomena to which bushmen refer in
    an off-hand tone of voice as &ldquo;the Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;, which
    seem to be held responsible, in a general way, for most of the out-back trouble.</p>
  <p>It takes less than a year to go up stream by boat to Walgett or Bourke in
    a dry season; but after the first three months the passengers generally go
    ashore and walk. They get sick of being stuck in the same sort of place,
    in the same old way; they grow weary of seeing the same old &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;  drop
    his swag on the bank opposite whenever the boat ties up for wood; they get
    tired of lending him tobacco, and listening to his ideas, which are limited
    in number and narrow in conception.</p>
  <p>It shortens the journey to get out and walk; but then you will have to wait
    so long for your luggage&mdash;unless you hump it with you.</p>
  <p>We heard of a man who determined to stick to a Darling boat and travel the
    whole length of the river. He was a newspaper man. He started on his voyage
    of discovery one Easter in flood-time, and a month later the captain got
    bushed between the Darling and South Australian border. The waters went away
    before he could find the river again, and left his boat in a scrub. They
    had a cargo of rations, and the crew stuck to the craft while the tucker
    lasted; when it gave out they rolled up their swags and went to look for
    a station, but didn&rsquo;t find one. The captain would study his watch and
    the sun, rig up dials and make out courses, and follow them without success.
    They ran short of water, and didn&rsquo;t smell any for weeks; they suffered
    terrible privations, and lost three of their number, <i>not</i> including
    the newspaper liar. There are even dark hints considering the drawing of
    lots in connection with something too terrible to mention. They crossed a
    thirty-mile plain at last, and sighted a black gin. She led them to a boundary
    rider&rsquo;s hut, where they were taken in and provided with rations and
    rum.</p>
  <p>Later on a syndicate was formed to explore the country and recover the boat;
    but they found her thirty miles from the river and about eighteen from the
    nearest waterhole deep enough to float her, so they left her there. She&rsquo;s
    there still, or else the man that told us about it is the greatest liar Out
    Back.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Imagine the hull of a North Shore ferry boat, blunted a little at the ends
    and cut off about a foot below the water-line, and parallel to it, then you
    will have something shaped somewhat like the hull of a Darling mud-rooter.
    But the river boat is much stronger. The boat we were on was built and repaired
    above deck after the different ideas of many bush carpenters, of whom the
    last seemed by his work to have regarded the original plan with a contempt
    only equalled by his disgust at the work of the last carpenter but one. The
    wheel was boxed in, mostly with round sapling-sticks fastened to the frame
    with bunches of nails and spikes of all shapes and sizes, most of them bent.
    The general result was decidedly picturesque in its irregularity, but dangerous
    to the mental welfare of any passenger who was foolish enough to try to comprehend
    the design; for it seemed as though every carpenter had taken the opportunity
    to work in a little abstract idea of his own.</p>
  <p>The way they &ldquo;dock&rdquo; a Darling River boat is beautiful for its
    simplicity. They choose a place where there are two stout trees about the
    boat&rsquo;s length apart, and standing on a line parallel to the river.
    They fix pulley-blocks to the trees, lay sliding planks down into the water,
    fasten a rope to one end of the steamer, and take the other end through the
    block attached to the tree and thence back aboard a second steamer; then
    they carry a rope similarly from the other end through the block on the second
    tree, and aboard a third boat. At a given signal one boat leaves for Wentworth,
    and the other starts for the Queensland border. The consequence is that craft
    number one climbs the bank amid the cheers of the local loafers, who congregate
    and watch the proceedings with great interest and approval. The crew pitch
    tents, and set to work on the hull, which looks like a big, rough shallow
    box.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We once travelled on the Darling for a hundred miles or so on a boat called
    the &lsquo;Mud Turtle&rsquo;&mdash;at least, that&rsquo;s what <i>we</i> called
    her. She might reasonably have haunted the Mississippi fifty years ago. She
    didn&rsquo;t seem particular where she went, or whether she started again
    or stopped for good after getting stuck. Her machinery sounded like a chapter
    of accidents and was always out of order, but she got along all the same,
    provided the steersman kept her off the bank.</p>
  <p>Her skipper was a young man, who looked more like a drover than a sailor,
    and the crew bore a greater resemblance to the unemployed than to any other
    body we know of, except that they looked a little more independent. They
    seemed clannish, too, with an unemployed or free-labour sort of isolation.
    We have an idea that they regarded our personal appearance with contempt.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Above Louth we picked up a &ldquo;whaler&rdquo;, who came aboard for the
    sake of society and tobacco. Not that he hoped to shorten his journey; he
    had no destination. He told us many reckless and unprincipled lies, and gave
    us a few ornamental facts. One of them took our fancy, and impressed us&mdash;with
    its beautiful simplicity, I suppose. He said: &ldquo;Some miles above where
    the Darlin&rsquo;  and the Warrygo runs inter each other, there&rsquo;s a
    billygong runnin&rsquo; right across between the two rivers and makin&rsquo; a
    sort of tryhangular hyland; &rsquo;n&rsquo; I can tel&rsquo;yer a funny thing
    about it.&rdquo; Here he paused to light his pipe. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he
    continued, impressively, jerking the match overboard, &ldquo;when the Darlin&rsquo;s
    up, and the Warrygo&rsquo;s <i>low</i>, the billygong runs from the Darlin&rsquo; into
    the <i>Warrygo</i>; <i>and</i>, when the Warrygo&rsquo;s up &rsquo;n&rsquo; the
    Darlin&rsquo;s down, the waters runs <i>from</i> the Warrygo &rsquo;n&rsquo; inter
    the Darlin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What could be more simple?</p>
  <p>The steamer was engaged to go up a billabong for a load of shearers from
    a shed which was cutting out; and first it was necessary to tie up in the
    river and discharge the greater portion of the cargo in order that the boat
    might safely negotiate the shallow waters. A local fisherman, who volunteered
    to act as pilot, was taken aboard, and after he was outside about a pint
    of whisky he seemed to have the greatest confidence in his ability to take
    us to hell, or anywhere else&mdash;at least, he said so. A man was sent ashore
    with blankets and tucker to mind the wool, and we crossed the river, butted
    into the anabranch, and started out back. Only the Lord and the pilot know
    how we got there. We travelled over the bush, through its branches sometimes,
    and sometimes through grass and mud, and every now and then we struck something
    that felt and sounded like a collision. The boat slid down one hill, and  &ldquo;fetched&rdquo; a
    stump at the bottom with a force that made every mother&rsquo;s son bite
    his tongue or break a tooth.</p>
  <p>The shearers came aboard next morning, with their swags and two cartloads
    of boiled mutton, bread, &ldquo;brownie&rdquo;, and tea and sugar. They numbered
    about fifty, including the rouseabouts. This load of sin sank the steamer
    deeper into the mud; but the passengers crowded over to port, by request
    of the captain, and the crew poked the bank away with long poles. When we
    began to move the shearers gave a howl like the yell of a legion of lost
    souls escaping from down below. They gave three cheers for the rouseabouts&rsquo; cook,
    who stayed behind; then they cursed the station with a mighty curse. They
    cleared a space on deck, had a jig, and afterwards a fight between the shearers&rsquo; cook
    and his assistant. They gave a mighty bush whoop for the Darling when the
    boat swung into that grand old gutter, and in the evening they had a general
    all-round time. We got back, and the crew had to reload the wool without
    assistance, for it bore the accursed brand of a &ldquo;freedom-of-contract&rdquo; shed.</p>
  <p>We slept, or tried to sleep, that night on the ridge of two wool bales laid
    with the narrow sides up, having first been obliged to get ashore and fight
    six rounds with a shearer for the privilege of roosting there. The live cinders
    from the firebox went up the chimney all night, and fell in showers on deck.
    Every now and again a spark would burn through the &ldquo;Wagga rug&rdquo; of
    a sleeping shearer, and he&rsquo;d wake suddenly and get up and curse. It
    was no use shifting round, for the wind was all ways, and the boat steered
    north, south, east, and west to humour the river. Occasionally a low branch
    would root three or four passengers off their wool bales, and they&rsquo;d
    get up and curse in chorus. The boat started two snags; and towards daylight
    struck a stump. The accent was on the stump. A wool bale went overboard,
    and took a swag and a dog with it; then the owner of the swag and dog and
    the crew of the boat had a swearing match between them. The swagman won.</p>
  <p>About daylight we stretched our cramped limbs, extricated one leg from between
    the wool bales, and found that the steamer was just crayfishing away from
    a mud island, where she had tied up for more wool. Some of the chaps had
    been ashore and boiled four or five buckets of tea and coffee. Shortly after
    the boat had settled down to work again an incident came along. A rouseabout
    rose late, and, while the others were at breakfast, got an idea into his
    head that a good &ldquo;sloosh&rdquo; would freshen him up; so he mooched
    round until he found a big wooden bucket with a rope to it. He carried the
    bucket aft of the wheel. The boat was butting up stream for all she was worth,
    and the stream was running the other way, of course, and about a hundred
    times as fast as a train. The jackeroo gave the line a turn round his wrist;
    before anyone could see him in time to suppress him, he lifted the bucket,
    swung it to and fro, and dropped it cleverly into the water.</p>
  <p>This delayed us for nearly an hour. A couple of men jumped into the row
    boat immediately and cast her adrift. They picked up the jackeroo about a
    mile down the river, clinging to a snag, and when we hauled him aboard he
    looked like something the cat had dragged in, only bigger. We revived him
    with rum and got him on his feet; and then, when the captain and crew had
    done cursing him, he rubbed his head, went forward, and had a look at the
    paddle; then he rubbed his head again, thought, and remarked to his mates:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it lucky I didn&rsquo;t dip that bucket <i>for&rsquo;ard</i> the
    wheel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This remark struck us forcibly. We agreed that it was lucky&mdash;for him;
    but the captain remarked that it was damned unlucky for the world, which,
    he explained, was over-populated with fools already.</p>
  <p>Getting on towards afternoon we found a barge loaded with wool and tied
    up to a tree in the wilderness. There was no sign of a man to be seen, nor
    any sign, except the barge, that a human being had ever been there. The captain
    took the craft in tow, towed it about ten miles up the stream, and left it
    in a less likely place than where it was before.</p>
  <p>Floating bottles began to be more frequent, and we knew by that same token
    that we were nearing &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Luck!&rdquo;&mdash;Bourke, we mean.
    And this reminds us.</p>
  <p>When the Brewarrina people observe a more than ordinary number of bottles
    floating down the river, they guess that Walgett is on the spree; when the
    Louth chaps see an unbroken procession of dead marines for three or four
    days they know that Bourke&rsquo;s drunk. The poor, God-abandoned &ldquo;whaler&rdquo; sits
    in his hungry camp at sunset and watches the empty symbols of Hope go by,
    and feels more God-forgotten than ever&mdash;and thirstier, if possible&mdash;and
    gets a great, wide, thirsty, quaking, empty longing to be up where those
    bottles come from. If the townspeople knew how much misery they caused by
    their thoughtlessness they would drown their dead marines, or bury them,
    but on no account allow them to go drifting down the river, and stirring
    up hells in the bosoms of less fortunate fellow-creatures.</p>
  <p>There came a man from Adelaide to Bourke once, and he collected all the
    empty bottles in town, stacked them by the river, and waited for a boat.
    What he wanted them for the legend sayeth not, but the people reckoned he
    had a &ldquo;private still&rdquo;, or something of that sort, somewhere down
    the river, and were satisfied. What he came from Adelaide for, or whether
    he really did come from there, we do not know. All the Darling bunyips are
    supposed to come from Adelaide. Anyway, the man collected all the empty bottles
    he could lay his hands on, and piled them on the bank, where they made a
    good show. He waited for a boat to take his cargo, and, while waiting, he
    got drunk. That excited no comment. He stayed drunk for three weeks, but
    the townspeople saw nothing unusual in that. In order to become an object
    of interest in their eyes, and in that line, he would have had to stay drunk
    for a year and fight three times a day&mdash;oftener, if possible&mdash;and
    lie in the road in the broiling heat between whiles, and be walked on by
    camels and Afghans and free-labourers, and be locked up every time he got
    sober enough to smash a policeman, and try to hang himself naked, and be
    finally squashed by a loaded wool team.</p>
  <p>But while he drank the Darling rose, for reasons best known to itself, and
    floated those bottles off. They strung out and started for the Antarctic
    Ocean, with a big old wicker-worked demijohn in the lead.</p>
  <p>For the first week the down-river men took no notice; but after the bottles
    had been drifting past with scarcely a break for a fortnight or so, they
    began to get interested. Several whalers watched the procession until they
    got the jimjams by force of imagination, and when their bodies began to float
    down with the bottles, the down-river people got anxious.</p>
  <p>At last the Mayor of Wilcannia wired Bourke to know whether Dibbs or Parkes
    was dead, or democracy triumphant, or if not, wherefore the jubilation? Many
    telegrams of a like nature were received during that week, and the true explanation
    was sent in reply to each. But it wasn&rsquo;t believed, and to this day
    Bourke has the name of being the most drunken town on the river.</p>
  <p>After dinner a humorous old hard case mysteriously took us aside and said
    he had a good yarn which we might be able to work up. We asked him how, but
    he winked a mighty cunning wink and said that he knew all about us. Then
    he asked us to listen. He said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was an old feller down the Murrumbidgee named Kelly. He was
    a bit gone here. One day Kelly was out lookin&rsquo; for some sheep, when
    he got lost. It was gettin&rsquo; dark. Bymeby there came an old crow in
    a tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st! Kel-ley, you&rsquo;re lo-o-st!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know I am,&rsquo; sez Kelly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Fol-ler me, fol-ler me,&rsquo; sez the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Right y&rsquo;are,&rsquo; sez Kelly, with a jerk of his arm. &lsquo;Go
    ahead.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So the crow went on, and Kelly follered, an&rsquo; bymeby he found
    he was on the right track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometime after Kelly was washin&rsquo; sheep (this was when we useter
    wash the sheep instead of the wool). Kelly was standin&rsquo; on the platform
    with a crutch in his hand landin&rsquo; the sheep, when there came a old
    crow in the tree overhead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Kelly, I&rsquo;m hun-gry! Kel-ley, I&rsquo;m hun-ger-ry!&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Alright,&rsquo; sez Kelly; &lsquo;be up at the hut about dinner
    time &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll sling you out something.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep! Drown&mdash;a&mdash;sheep, Kel-ley,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Blanked if I do,&rsquo; sez Kelly. &lsquo;If I drown a sheep
    I&rsquo;ll have to pay for it, be-God!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I won&rsquo;t find yer when yer lost agin,&rsquo; sez
    the crow.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if yer will,&rsquo; says Kelly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take blanky good care I won&rsquo;t get lost again, to be found by a gory
    ole crow.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>There are a good many fishermen on the Darling. They camp along the banks
    in all sorts of tents, and move about in little box boats that will only
    float one man. The fisherman is never heavy. He is mostly a withered little
    old madman, with black claws, dirty rags (which he never changes), unkempt
    hair and beard, and a &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; expression. We cannot say that
    we ever saw him catch a fish, or even get a bite, and we certainly never
    saw him offer any for sale.</p>
  <p>He gets a dozen or so lines out into the stream, with the shore end fastened
    to pegs or roots on the bank, and passed over sticks about four feet high,
    stuck in the mud; on the top of these sticks he hangs bullock bells, or substitutes&mdash;jam
    tins with stones fastened inside to bits of string. Then he sits down and
    waits. If the cod pulls the line the bell rings.</p>
  <p>The fisherman is a great authority on the river and fish, but has usually
    forgotten everything else, including his name. He chops firewood for the
    boats sometimes, but it isn&rsquo;t his profession&mdash;he&rsquo;s a fisherman.
    He is only sane on points concerning the river, though he has all the fisherman&rsquo;s
    eccentricities. Of course he is a liar.</p>
  <p>When he gets his camp fixed on one bank it strikes him he ought to be over
    on the other, or at a place up round the bend, so he shifts. Then he reckons
    he was a fool for not stopping where he was before. He never dies. He never
    gets older, or drier, or more withered looking, or dirtier, or loonier&mdash;because
    he can&rsquo;t. We cannot imagine him as ever having been a boy, or even
    a youth. We cannot even try to imagine him as a baby. He is an animated mummy,
    who used to fish on the Nile three thousand years ago, and catch nothing.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>We forgot to mention that there are wonderfully few wrecks on the Darling.
    The river boats seldom go down&mdash;their hulls are not built that way&mdash;and
    if one did go down it wouldn&rsquo;t sink far. But, once down, a boat is
    scarcely ever raised again; because, you see, the mud silts up round it and
    over it, and glues it, as it were, to the bottom of the river. Then the forty-foot
    alligators&mdash;which come down with the &ldquo;Queenslan&rsquo; rains&rdquo;,
    we suppose&mdash;root in the mud and fill their bellies with sodden flour
    and drowned deck-hands.</p>
  <p>They tried once to blow up a wreck with dynamite because it (the wreck)
    obstructed navigation; but they blew the bottom out of the river instead,
    and all the water went through. The Government have been boring for it ever
    since. I saw some of the bores myself&mdash;there is one at Coonamble.</p>
  <p>There is a yarn along the Darling about a cute Yankee who was invited up
    to Bourke to report on a proposed scheme for locking the river. He arrived
    towards the end of a long and severe drought, and was met at the railway
    station by a deputation of representative bushmen, who invited him, in the
    first place, to accompany them to the principal pub&mdash;which he did. He
    had been observed to study the scenery a good deal while coming up in the
    train, but kept his conclusions to himself. On the way to the pub he had
    a look at the town, and it was noticed that he tilted his hat forward very
    often, and scratched the back of his head a good deal, and pondered a lot;
    but he refrained from expressing an opinion&mdash;even when invited to do
    so. He guessed that his opinions wouldn&rsquo;t do much good, anyway, and
    he calculated that they would keep till he got back &ldquo;over our way&rdquo;&mdash;by
    which it was reckoned he meant the States.</p>
  <p>When they asked him what he&rsquo;d have, he said to Watty the publican:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wal, I reckon you can build me your national drink. I guess I&rsquo;ll
    try it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A long colonial was drawn for him, and he tried it. He seemed rather startled
    at first, then he looked curiously at the half-empty glass, set it down very
    softly on the bar, and leaned against the same and fell into a reverie; from
    which he roused himself after a while, with a sorrowful jerk of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Show me this river of yourn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They led him to the Darling, and he had a look at it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is this your river?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied, apprehensively.</p>
  <p>He tilted his hat forward till the brim nearly touched his nose, scratched
    the back of his long neck, shut one eye, and looked at the river with the
    other. Then, after spitting half a pint of tobacco juice into the stream,
    he turned sadly on his heel and led the way back to the pub. He invited the
    boys to &ldquo;pisen themselves&rdquo;; after they were served he ordered
    out the longest tumbler on the premises, poured a drop into it from nearly
    every bottle on the shelf, added a lump of ice, and drank slowly and steadily.</p>
  <p>Then he took pity on the impatient and anxious population, opened his mouth,
    and spake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, fellows,&rdquo; he drawled, jerking his arm in the direction
    of the river, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll dew. I&rsquo;ll
    bottle that damned river of yourn in twenty-four hours!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Later on he mellowed a bit, under the influence of several drinks which
    were carefully and conscientiously &ldquo;built&rdquo; from plans and specifications
    supplied by himself, and then, among other things, he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If that there river rises as high as you say it dew&mdash;and if
    this was the States&mdash;why, we&rsquo;d have had the Great Eastern up here
    twenty years ago&rdquo;&mdash;or words to that effect.</p>
  <p>Then he added, reflectively:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When I come over here I calculated that I was going to make things
    hum, but now I guess I&rsquo;ll have to change my prospectus. There&rsquo;s
    a lot of loose energy laying round over our way, but I guess that if I wanted
    to make things move in your country I&rsquo;d have to bring over the entire
    American nation&mdash;also his wife and dawg. You&rsquo;ve got the makings
    of a glorious nation over here, but you don&rsquo;t get up early enough!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The only national work performed by the blacks is on the Darling. They threw
    a dam of rocks across the river&mdash;near Brewarrina, we think&mdash;to
    make a fish trap. It&rsquo;s there yet. But God only knows where they got
    the stones from, or how they carried them, for there isn&rsquo;t a pebble
    within forty miles.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACasefortheOracle"></a>A Case for the Oracle</b></h2>
  <p>The Oracle and I were camped together. The Oracle was a bricklayer by trade,
    and had two or three small contracts on hand. I was &ldquo;doing a bit of
    house-painting&rdquo;. There were a plasterer, a carpenter, and a plumber&mdash;we
    were all T&rsquo;othersiders, and old mates, and we worked things together.
    It was in Westralia&mdash;the Land of T&rsquo;othersiders&mdash;and, therefore,
    we were not surprised when Mitchell turned up early one morning, with his
    swag and an atmosphere of salt water about him.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d had a rough trip, he said, and would take a spell that day and
    take the lay of the land and have something cooked for us by the time we
    came home; and go to graft himself next morning. And next morning he went
    to work, &ldquo;labouring&rdquo; for the Oracle.</p>
  <p>The Oracle and his mates, being small contractors and not pressed for time,
    had dispensed with the services of a labourer, and had done their own mixing
    and hod-carrying in turns. They didn&rsquo;t want a labourer now, but the
    Oracle was a vague fatalist, and Mitchell a decided one. So it passed.</p>
  <p>The Oracle had a &ldquo;Case&rdquo; right under his nose&mdash;in his own
    employ, in fact; but was not aware of the fact until Mitchell drew his attention
    to it. The Case went by the name of Alfred O&rsquo;Briar&mdash;which hinted
    a mixed parentage. He was a small, nervous working-man, of no particular
    colour, and no decided character, apparently. If he had a soul above bricks,
    he never betrayed it. He was not popular on the jobs. There was something
    sly about Alf, they said.</p>
  <p>The Oracle had taken him on in the first place as a day-labourer, but afterwards
    shared the pay with him as with Mitchell. O&rsquo;Briar shouted&mdash;judiciously,
    but on every possible occasion&mdash;for the Oracle; and, as he was an indifferent
    workman, the boys said he only did this so that the Oracle might keep him
    on. If O&rsquo;Briar took things easy and did no more than the rest of us,
    at least one of us would be sure to get it into his head that he was loafing
    on us; and if he grafted harder than we did, we&rsquo;d be sure to feel indignant
    about that too, and reckon that it was done out of nastiness or crawlsomeness,
    and feel a contempt for him accordingly. We found out accidentally that O&rsquo;Briar
    was an excellent mimic and a bit of a ventriloquist, but he never entertained
    us with his peculiar gifts; and we set that down to churlishness.</p>
  <p>O&rsquo;Briar kept his own counsel, and his history, if he had one; and
    hid his hopes, joys, and sorrows, if he had any, behind a vacant grin, as
    Mitchell hid his behind a quizzical one. He never resented alleged satire&mdash;perhaps
    he couldn&rsquo;t see it&mdash;and therefore he got the name of being a cur.
    As a rule, he was careful with his money, and was called mean&mdash;not,
    however, by the Oracle, whose philosophy was simple, and whose sympathy could
    not realise a limit; nor yet by Mitchell. Mitchell waited.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>O&rsquo;Briar occupied a small tent by himself, and lived privately of evenings.
    When we began to hear two men talking at night in his tent, we were rather
    surprised, and wondered in a vague kind of way how any of the chaps could
    take sufficient interest in Alf to go in and yarn with him. In the days when
    he was supposed to be sociable, we had voted him a bore; even the Oracle
    was moved to admit that he was &ldquo;a bit slow&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>But late one night we distinctly heard a woman&rsquo;s voice in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s
    tent. The Oracle suddenly became hard of hearing, and, though we heard the
    voice on several occasions, he remained exasperatingly deaf, yet aggressively
    unconscious of the fact. &ldquo;I have got enough to do puzzling over me
    own whys and wherefores,&rdquo; he said. Mitchell began to take some interest
    in O&rsquo;Briar, and treated him with greater respect. But our camp had
    the name of being the best-constructed, the cleanest, and the most respectable
    in the vicinity. The health officer and constable in charge had complimented
    us on the fact, and we were proud of it. And there were three young married
    couples in camp, also a Darby and Joan; therefore, when the voice of a woman
    began to be heard frequently and at disreputable hours of the night in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s
    tent, we got uneasy about it. And when the constable who was on night duty
    gave us a friendly hint, Mitchell and I agreed that something must be done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Av coorse, men will be men,&rdquo; said the constable, as he turned
    his horse&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;but I thought I&rsquo;d mention it. O&rsquo;Briar
    is a dacent man, and he&rsquo;s one of yer mates. Av coorse. There&rsquo;s
    a bad lot in that camp in the scrub over yander, and&mdash;av coorse. Good-day
    to ye, byes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Next night we heard the voice in O&rsquo;Briar&rsquo;s tent again, and decided
    to speak to Alf in a friendly way about it in the morning. We listened outside
    in the dark, but could not distinguish the words, though I thought I recognised
    the voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hussy from the camp over there; she&rsquo;s got holt
    of that fool, and she&rsquo;ll clean him out before she&rsquo;s done,&rdquo; I
    said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re Alf&rsquo;s mates, any way it goes, and we ought
    to put a stop to it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What hussy?&rdquo; asked Mitchell; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s three or
    four there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The one with her hair all over her head,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where else should it be?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll
    just have a peep and see who it is. There&rsquo;s no harm in that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He crept up to the tent and cautiously moved the flap. Alf&rsquo;s candle
    was alight; he lay on his back in his bunk with his arms under his head,
    calmly smoking. We withdrew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They must have heard us,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;and she&rsquo;s
    slipped out under the tent at the back, and through the fence into the scrub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s respect for Alf increased visibly.</p>
  <p>But we began to hear ominous whispers from the young married couples, and
    next Saturday night, which was pay-night, we decided to see it through. We
    did not care to speak to Alf until we were sure. He stayed in camp, as he
    often did, on Saturday evening, while the others went up town. Mitchell and
    I returned earlier than usual, and leaned on the fence at the back of Alf&rsquo;s
    tent.</p>
  <p>We were scarcely there when we were startled by a &ldquo;rat-tat-tat&rdquo; as
    of someone knocking at a door. Then an old woman&rsquo;s voice <i>inside</i> the
    tent asked: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; said Alf&rsquo;s voice from the front, &ldquo;Mr.
    O&rsquo;Briar from Perth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary, go and open the door!&rdquo; said the old woman. (Mitchell
    nudged me to keep quiet.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer,&rdquo; said the old woman. &ldquo;Come
    in. How do you do? When did you get back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only last night,&rdquo; said Alf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at that now! Bless us all! And how did you like the country
    at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t care much for it,&rdquo; said Alf. We lost the thread
    of it until the old woman spoke again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you had your tea, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you quite sure, man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite sure, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo; (Mitchell trod
    on my foot.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will you have a drop of whisky or a glass of beer, Mr. O&rsquo;Breer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a glass of beer, thank you, Mrs. O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There seemed to be a long pause. Then the old woman said, &ldquo;Ah, well,
    I must get my work done, and Mary will stop here and keep you company, Mr.
    O&rsquo;Breer.&rdquo; The arrangement seemed satisfactory to all parties,
    for there was nothing more said for a while. (Mitchell nudged me again, with
    emphasis, and I kicked his shin.)</p>
  <p>Presently Alf said: &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; And a girl&rsquo;s voice said, &ldquo;Yes,
    Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember the night I went away, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Alf, I do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have travelled long ways since then, Mary; I worked hard and lived
    close. I didn&rsquo;t make my fortune, but I managed to rub a note or two
    together. It was a hard time and a lonesome time for me, Mary. The summer&rsquo;s
    awful over there, and livin&rsquo;s bad and dear. You couldn&rsquo;t have
    any idea of it, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t come back so well off as I expected.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t matter, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got heart-sick and tired of it, and couldn&rsquo;t stand it any
    longer, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s all over now, Alf; you mustn&rsquo;t think of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your mother wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know she did&rdquo;&mdash;(very low and gently).</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you know what she put in it, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And did you ask her to put it in?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Alf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s all true, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no answer, but the silence seemed satisfactory.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And be sure you have yourself down here on Sunday, Alf, me son.&rdquo;  (&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
    the old woman come back!&rdquo; said Mitchell.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; since the girl&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; to have ye, and the
    ould woman&rsquo;s willin&rsquo;&mdash;there&rsquo;s me hand on it, Alf,
    me boy. An&rsquo; God bless ye both.&rdquo; (&ldquo;The old man&rsquo;s come
    now,&rdquo; said Mitchell.)</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come along,&rdquo; said Mitchell, leading the way to the front of
    the tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t like to intrude on them. It&rsquo;s hardly right,
    Mitchell, is it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He tapped the tent
    pole.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Alf. Alf was lying on his bunk as before, with
    his arms under his head. His face wore a cheerful, not to say happy, expression.
    There was no one else in the tent. I was never more surprised in my life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got the paper, Alf?&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. You&rsquo;ll find it there at the foot of the bunk. There it
    is. Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Mitchell?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not to-night,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;We brought you a bottle
    of ale. We&rsquo;re just going to turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And we said &ldquo;good-night&rdquo;. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said to Mitchell
    when we got inside, &ldquo;what do you think of it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think of it at all,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Do
    you mean to say you can&rsquo;t see it now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m dashed if I can,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Some of us must
    be drunk, I think, or getting rats. It&rsquo;s not to be wondered at, and
    the sooner we get out of this country the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you must be a fool, Joe,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t
    you see? <i>Alf thinks aloud</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>What?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Talks to himself. He was thinking about going back to his sweetheart.
    Don&rsquo;t you know he&rsquo;s a bit of a ventriloquist?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lay awake a long time, in the position that Alf usually lay in,
    and thought. Perhaps he thought on the same lines as Alf did that night.
    But Mitchell did his thinking in silence.</p>
  <p>We thought it best to tell the Oracle quietly. He was deeply interested,
    but not surprised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd of such cases before,&rdquo; he
    said. But the Oracle was a gentleman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s things that a
    man wants to keep to himself that ain&rsquo;t his business,&rdquo; he said.
    And we understood this remark to be intended for our benefit, and to indicate
    a course of action upon which the Oracle had decided, with respect to this
    case, and which we, in his opinion, should do well to follow.</p>
  <p>Alf got away a week or so later, and we all took a holiday and went down
    to Fremantle to see him off. Perhaps he wondered why Mitchell gripped his
    hand so hard and wished him luck so earnestly, and was surprised when he
    gave him three cheers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; remarked Mitchell, as we turned up the wharf.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heerd of such cases before,&rdquo; said the Oracle, meditatively.  &ldquo;They
    ain&rsquo;t common, but I&rsquo;ve hear&rsquo;d of such cases before.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADaughterofMaoriland"></a>A Daughter of Maoriland</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">A Sketch of Poor-Class Maoris</p>
  <p>The new native-school teacher, who was &ldquo;green&rdquo;, &ldquo;soft&rdquo;,
    and poetical, and had a literary ambition, called her &ldquo;August&rdquo;,
    and fondly hoped to build a romance on her character. She was down in the
    school registers as Sarah Moses, Maori, 16 years and three months. She looked
    twenty; but this was nothing, insomuch as the mother of the youngest child
    in the school&mdash;a dear little half-caste lady of two or three summers&mdash;had
    not herself the vaguest idea of the child&rsquo;s age, nor anybody else&rsquo;s,
    nor of ages in the abstract. The church register was lost some six years
    before, when &ldquo;Granny&rdquo;, who was a hundred, if a day, was supposed
    to be about twenty-five. The teacher had to guess the ages of all the new
    pupils.</p>
  <p>August was apparently the oldest in the school&mdash;a big, ungainly, awkward
    girl, with a heavy negro type of Maori countenance, and about as much animation,
    mentally or physically, as a cow. She was given to brooding; in fact, she
    brooded all the time. She brooded all day over her school work, but did it
    fairly well. How the previous teachers had taught her all she knew was a
    mystery to the new one. There had been a tragedy in August&rsquo;s family
    when she was a child, and the affair seemed to have cast a gloom over the
    lives of the entire family, for the lowering brooding cloud was on all their
    faces. August would take to the bush when things went wrong at home, and
    climb a tree and brood till she was found and coaxed home. Things, according
    to pa gossip, had gone wrong with her from the date of the tragedy, when
    she, a bright little girl, was taken&mdash;a homeless orphan&mdash;to live
    with a sister, and, afterwards, with an aunt-by-marriage. They treated her, &rsquo;twas
    said, with a brutality which must have been greatly exaggerated by pa-gossip,
    seeing that unkindness of this description is, according to all the best
    authorities, altogether foreign to Maori nature.</p>
  <p>Pa-gossip&mdash;which is less reliable than the ordinary washerwoman kind,
    because of a deeper and more vicious ignorance&mdash;had it that one time
    when August was punished by a teacher (or beaten by her sister or aunt-by-marriage)
    she &ldquo;took to the bush&rdquo; for three days, at the expiration of which
    time she was found on the ground in an exhausted condition. She was evidently
    a true Maori or savage, and this was one of the reasons why the teacher with
    the literary ambition took an interest in her. She had a print of a portrait
    of a man in soldier&rsquo;s uniform, taken from a copy of the <i>Illustrated
    London News</i>, pasted over the fireplace in the whare where she lived,
    and neatly bordered by vandyked strips of silvered tea-paper. She had pasted
    it in the place of honour, or as near as she could get to it. The place of
    honour was sacred to framed representations of the Nativity and Catholic
    subjects, half-modelled, half-pictured. The print was a portrait of the last
    Czar of Russia, of all the men in the world; and August was reported to have
    said that she loved that man. His father had been murdered, so had her mother.
    This was one of the reasons why the teacher with the literary ambition thought
    he could get a romance out of her.</p>
  <p>After the first week she hung round the new schoolmistress, dog-like&mdash;with &ldquo;dog-like
    affection&rdquo;, thought the teacher. She came down often during the holidays,
    and hung about the verandah and back door for an hour or so; then, by-and-bye,
    she&rsquo;d be gone. Her brooding seemed less aggressive on such occasions.
    The teacher reckoned that she had something on her mind, and wanted to open
    her heart to &ldquo;the wife&rdquo;, but was too ignorant or too shy, poor
    girl; and he reckoned, from his theory of Maori character, that it might
    take her weeks, or months, to come to the point. One day, after a great deal
    of encouragement, she explained that she felt &ldquo;so awfully lonely, Mrs.
    Lorrens.&rdquo;  All the other girls were away, and she wished it was school-time.</p>
  <p>She was happy and cheerful again, in her brooding way, in the playground.
    There was something sadly ludicrous about her great, ungainly figure slopping
    round above the children at play. The schoolmistress took her into the parlour,
    gave her tea and cake, and was kind to her; and she took it all with broody
    cheerfulness.</p>
  <p>One Sunday morning she came down to the cottage and sat on the edge of the
    verandah, looking as wretchedly miserable as a girl could. She was in rags&mdash;at
    least, she had a rag of a dress on&mdash;and was barefooted and bareheaded.
    She said that her aunt had turned her out, and she was going to walk down
    the coast to Whale Bay to her grandmother&mdash;a long day&rsquo;s ride.
    The teacher was troubled, because he was undecided what to do. He had to
    be careful to avoid any unpleasantness arising out of Maori cliquism. As
    the teacher he couldn&rsquo;t let her go in the state she was in; from the
    depths of his greenness he trusted her, from the depths of his softness he
    pitied her; his poetic nature was fiercely indignant on account of the poor
    girl&rsquo;s wrongs, and the wife spoke for her. Then he thought of his unwritten
    romance, and regarded August in the light of copy, and that settled it. While
    he talked the matter over with his wife, August &ldquo;hid in the dark of
    her hair,&rdquo; awaiting her doom. The teacher put his hat on, walked up
    to the pa, and saw her aunt. She denied that she had turned August out, but
    the teacher believed the girl. He explained his position, in words simplified
    for Maori comprehension, and the aunt and relations said they understood,
    and that he was &ldquo;perfectly right, Mr. Lorrens.&rdquo;  They were very
    respectful. The teacher said that if August would not return home, he was
    willing to let her stay at the cottage until such time as her uncle, who
    was absent, returned, and he (the teacher) could talk the matter over with
    him. The relations thought that that was the very best thing that could be
    done, and thanked him. The aunt, two sisters, and as many of the others,
    including the children, as were within sight or hail at the time&mdash;most
    of them could not by any possible means have had the slightest connection
    with the business in hand&mdash;accompanied the teacher to the cottage. August
    took to the flax directly she caught sight of her relations, and was with
    difficulty induced to return. There was a lot of talk in Maori, during which
    the girl and her aunt shuffled and swung round at the back of each other,
    and each talked over her shoulder, and laughed foolishly and awkwardly once
    or twice; but in the end the girl was sullenly determined not to return home,
    so it was decided that she should stay. The schoolmistress made tea.</p>
  <p>August brightened from the first day. She was a different girl altogether. &ldquo;I
    never saw such a change in a girl,&rdquo; said the young schoolmistress,
    and one or two others. &ldquo;I always thought she was a good girl if taken
    the right way; all she wanted was a change and kind treatment.&rdquo; But
    the stolid old Maori chairman of the school committee only shrugged his shoulders
    and said (when the schoolmistress, woman-like, pressed him for an opinion
    to agree with her own), &ldquo;You can look at it two ways, Mrs. Lorrens.&rdquo; Which,
    by the way, was about the only expression of opinion that the teacher was
    ever able to get out of him on any subject.</p>
  <p>August worked and behaved well. She was wonderfully quick in picking up
    English ways and housework. True, she was awkward and not over cleanly in
    some things, but her mistress had patience with her. Who wouldn&rsquo;t have?
    She &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t do enough&rdquo; for her benefactress; she hung
    on her words and sat at her footstool of evenings in a way that gladdened
    the teacher&rsquo;s sentimental nature; she couldn&rsquo;t bear to see him
    help his wife with a hat-pin or button&mdash;August must do it. She insisted
    on doing her mistress&rsquo; hair every night. In short, she tried in every
    way to show her gratitude. The teacher and his wife smiled brightly at each
    other behind her back, and thought how cheerful the house was since she came,
    and wondered what they&rsquo;d do without her. It was a settled thing that
    they should take her back to the city with them, and have a faithful and
    grateful retainer all their lives and a sort of Aunt Chloe for their children,
    when they had any. The teacher got yards of copy out of her for his &ldquo;Maori
    Sketches and Characters&rdquo;, worked joyously at his romance, and felt
    great already, and was happy. She had a bed made up temporarily (until the
    teacher could get a spring mattress for her from town) on the floor in the
    dining-room, and when she&rsquo;d made her bed she&rsquo;d squat on it in
    front of the fire and sing Maori songs in a soft voice. She&rsquo;d sing
    the teacher and his wife, in the next room, to sleep. Then she&rsquo;d get
    up and have a feed, but they never heard her.</p>
  <p>Her manners at the table (for she was treated &ldquo;like one of themselves&rdquo; in
    the broadest sense of the term) were surprisingly good, considering that
    the adults of her people were decidedly cow-like in white society, and scoffed
    sea-eggs, shell-fish, and mutton-birds at home with a gallop which was not
    edifying. Her appetite, it was true, was painful at times to the poetic side
    of the teacher&rsquo;s nature; but he supposed that she&rsquo;d been half-starved
    at home, poor girl, and would get over it. Anyway, the copy he&rsquo;d get
    out of her would repay him for this and other expenses a hundredfold. Moreover,
    begging and borrowing had ceased with her advent, and the teacher set this
    down to her influence.</p>
  <p>The first jar came when she was sent on horseback to the town for groceries,
    and didn&rsquo;t get back till late the next day. She explained that some
    of her relations got hold of her and made her stay, and wanted her to go
    into public-houses with them, but she wouldn&rsquo;t. She said that <i>she</i> wanted
    to come home. But why didn&rsquo;t she? The teacher let it pass, and hoped
    she&rsquo;d gain strength of character by-and-bye. He had waited up late
    the night before with her supper on the hob; and he and his wife had been
    anxious for fear something had happened to the poor girl who was under their
    care. He had walked to the treacherous river-ford several times during the
    evening, and waited there for her. So perhaps he was tired, and that was
    why he didn&rsquo;t write next night.</p>
  <p>The sugar-bag, the onion-basket, the potato-bag and the tea-chest began
    to &ldquo;go down&rdquo; alarmingly, and an occasional pound of candles,
    a pigeon, a mutton-bird (plucked and ready for Sunday&rsquo;s cooking), and
    other little trifles went, also. August couldn&rsquo;t understand it, and
    the teacher believed her, for falsehood and deceit are foreign to the simple
    natures of the modern Maoris. There were no cats; but no score of ordinary
    cats could have given colour to the cat theory, had it been raised in this
    case. The breath of August advertised onions more than once, but no human
    stomach could have accounted for the quantity. She surely could not have
    eaten the other things raw&mdash;and she had no opportunities for private
    cooking, as far as the teacher and his wife could see. The other Maoris were
    out of the question; they were all strictly honest.</p>
  <p>Thefts and annoyances of the above description were credited to the &ldquo;swaggies&rdquo; who
    infested the roads, and had a very bad name down that way; so the teacher
    loaded his gun, and told August to rouse him at once, if she heard a sound
    in the night. She said she would; but a heavy-weight &ldquo;swaggie&rdquo;  could
    have come in and sat on her and had a smoke without waking her.</p>
  <p>She couldn&rsquo;t be trusted to go a message. She&rsquo;d take from three
    to six hours, and come back with an excuse that sounded genuine from its
    very simplicity. Another sister of hers lay ill in an isolated hut, alone
    and uncared for, except by the teacher&rsquo;s wife, and occasionally by
    a poor pa outcast who had negro blood in her veins, and a love for a white
    loafer. God help her! All of which sounds strange, considering that Maoris
    are very kind to each other. The schoolmistress sent August one night to
    stay with the sick Maori woman and help her as she could, and gave her strict
    instructions to come to the cottage first thing in the morning, and tell
    her how the sick woman was. August turned up at lunch-time next day. The
    teacher gave her her first lecture, and said plainly that he wasn&rsquo;t
    to be taken for a fool; then he stepped aside to get cool, and, when he returned,
    the girl was sobbing as if her heart would break, and the wife comforting
    her. She had been up all night, poor girl, and was thoroughly worn out. Somehow
    the teacher didn&rsquo;t feel uncomfortable about it. He went down to the
    whare. August had not touched a dishcloth or broom. She had slept, as she
    always did, like a pig, all night, while her sister lay and tossed in agony;
    in the morning she ate everything there was to eat in the house (which, it
    seemed, was the Maori way of showing sympathy in sickness and trouble), after
    which she brooded by the fire till the children, running out of school, announced
    the teacher&rsquo;s lunch hour.</p>
  <p>August braced up again for a little while. The master thought of the trouble
    they had with Ayacanora in &ldquo;Westward Ho&rdquo;, and was comforted,
    and tackled his romance again. Then the schoolmistress fell sick and things
    went wrong. The groceries went down faster than ever, and the house got very
    dirty, and began to have a native smell about it. August grew fat, and lazy,
    and dirty, and less reliable on washing-days, or when there was anything
    special to do in the house. &ldquo;The savage blood is strong,&rdquo; thought
    the teacher, &ldquo;and she is beginning to long for her own people and free
    unconventional life.&rdquo; One morning&mdash;on a washing-day, too, as it
    happened&mdash;she called out, before the teacher and his wife were up, that
    the Maoris who supplied them with milk were away, and she had promised to
    go up and milk the cow and bring the milk down. The teacher gave her permission.
    One of the scholars usually brought the milk early. Lunch time came and no
    August, no milk&mdash;strangest of all, only half the school children. The
    teacher put on his hat, and went up to the pa once more. He found August
    squatted in the midst of a circle of relations. She was entertaining them
    with one of a series of idealistic sketches of the teacher&rsquo;s domestic
    life, in which she showed a very vivid imagination, and exhibited an unaccountable
    savage sort of pessimism. Her intervals of absence had been occupied in this
    way from the first. The astounding slanders she had circulated concerning
    the teacher&rsquo;s private life came back, bit by bit, to his ears for a
    year afterwards, and her character sketches of previous teachers, and her
    own relations&mdash;for she spared nobody&mdash;would have earned a white
    woman a long and well-merited term of imprisonment for criminal libel. She
    had cunningly, by straightforward and unscrupulous lying, prejudiced the
    principal mother and boss woman of the pa against the teacher and his wife;
    as a natural result of which the old lady, who, like the rest, was very ignorant
    and ungrateful,  &ldquo;turned nasty&rdquo; and kept the children from school.
    The teacher lost his temper, so the children were rounded up and hurried
    down to school immediately; with them came August and her aunt, with alleged
    explanations and excuses, and a shell-fish. The aunt and sisters said they&rsquo;d
    have nothing to do with August. They didn&rsquo;t want her and wouldn&rsquo;t
    have her. The teacher said that, under those circumstances, she&rsquo;d better
    go and drown herself; so she went home with them.</p>
  <p>The whole business had been a plot by her nearest relations. They got rid
    of the trouble and expense of keeping her, and the bother of borrowing in
    person, whenever in need of trifles in the grocery line. Borrowing recommenced
    with her dismissal; but the teacher put a full stop to it, as far as he was
    concerned. Then August, egged on by her aunt, sent a blackguardly letter
    to the teacher&rsquo;s wife; the sick sister, by the way, who had been nursed
    and supplied with food by her all along, was in it, and said she was glad
    August sent the letter, and it served the schoolmistress right. The teacher
    went up to the pa once more; an hour later, August in person, accompanied,
    as usual, by a relation or two, delivered at the cottage an abject apology
    in writing, the composition of which would have discouraged the most enthusiastic
    advocate of higher education for the lower classes.</p>
  <p>Then various petty annoyances were tried. The teacher is firmly convinced
    that certain animal-like sounds round the house at night were due to August&rsquo;s
    trying to find out whether his wife was as likely to be haunted as the Maoris
    were. He didn&rsquo;t dream of such a thing at the time, for he did not believe
    that one of them had the pluck to venture out after dark. But savage superstition
    must give way to savage hate. The girl&rsquo;s last &ldquo;try-on&rdquo; was
    to come down to the school fence, and ostentatiously sharpen a table-knife
    on the wires, while she scowled murderously in the direction of the schoolmistress,
    who was hanging out her washing. August looked, in her dark, bushy, Maori
    hair, a thoroughly wild savage. Her father had murdered her mother under
    particularly brutal circumstances, and the daughter took after her father.</p>
  <p>The teacher called her and said: &ldquo;Now, look here, my lady, the best
    thing you can do is to drop that nonsense at once&rdquo; (she had dropped
    the knife in the ferns behind her), &ldquo;for we&rsquo;re the wrong sort
    of people to try it on with. Now you get out of this and tell your aunt&mdash;she&rsquo;s
    sneaking there in the flax&mdash;what I tell you, and that she&rsquo;d better
    clear out of this quick, or I&rsquo;ll have a policeman out and take the
    whole gang into town in an hour. Now be off, and shut that gate behind you,
    carefully, and fasten it.&rdquo; She did, and went.</p>
  <p>The worst of it was that the August romance copy was useless. Her lies were
    even less reliable and picturesque than the common Jones Alley hag lie. Then
    the teacher thought of the soft fool he&rsquo;d been, and that made him wild.
    He looked like a fool, and was one to a great extent, but it wasn&rsquo;t
    good policy to take him for one.</p>
  <p>Strange to say, he and others had reason to believe that August respected
    him, and liked him rather than otherwise; but she hated his wife, who had
    been kind to her, as only a savage can hate. The younger pupils told the
    teacher, cheerfully and confidently, that August said she&rsquo;d cut Mrs.
    Lorrens&rsquo;  throat the first chance she got. Next week the aunt sent
    down to ask if the teacher could sell her a bar of soap, and sent the same
    old shilling; he was tired of seeing it stuck out in front of him, so he
    took it, put it in his pocket, and sent the soap. This must have discouraged
    them, for the borrowing industry petered out. He saw the aunt later on, and
    she told him, cheerfully, that August was going to live with a half-caste
    in a certain house in town.</p>
  <p>Poor August! For she was only a tool after all. Her &ldquo;romance&rdquo; was
    briefly as follows:&mdash;She went, per off-hand Maori arrangement, as &lsquo;housekeeper&rsquo;  in
    the hut of a labourer at a neighbouring saw-mill. She stayed three months,
    for a wonder; at the expiration of which time she put on her hat and explained
    that she was tired of stopping there, and was going home. He said, &lsquo;All
    right, Sarah, wait a while and I&rsquo;ll take you home.&rsquo; At the door
    of her aunt&rsquo;s house he said, &lsquo;Well, good-bye, Sarah,&rsquo; and
    she said, in her brooding way, &lsquo;Good-bye, Jim.&rsquo; And that was
    all.</p>
  <p>As the last apparent result of August&rsquo;s mischief-making, her brother
    or someone one evening rode up to the cottage, drunk and inclined to bluster.
    He was accompanied by a friend, also drunk, who came to see the fun, and
    was ready to use his influence on the winning side. The teacher went inside,
    brought out his gun, and slipped two cartridges in. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
    enough of this,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Now then, be off, you insolent blackguards,
    or I&rsquo;ll shoot you like rabbits. Go!&rdquo; and he snapped his jaw and
    the breech of his gun together. As they rode off, the old local hawk happened
    to soar close over a dead lamb in the fern at the corner of the garden, and
    the teacher, who had been &ldquo;laying&rdquo;  for him a long time, let
    fly both barrels at him, without thinking. When he turned, there was only
    a cloud of dust down the track.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>The teacher taught that school for three years thereafter, without a hitch.
    But he went no more on Universal Brotherhood lines. And, for years after
    he had gone, his name was spoken of with great respect by the Maoris.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="NewYearsNight"></a>New Year&rsquo;s Night</b></h2>
  <p>It was dark enough for anything in Dead Man&rsquo;s Gap&mdash;a round, warm,
    close darkness, in which retreating sounds seemed to be cut off suddenly
    at a distance of a hundred yards or so, instead of growing faint and fainter,
    and dying away, to strike the ear once or twice again&mdash;and after minutes,
    it might seem&mdash;with startling distinctness, before being finally lost
    in the distance, as it is on clear, frosty nights. So with the sounds of
    horses&rsquo; hoofs, stumbling on the rough bridle-track through the &ldquo;saddle&rdquo;,
    the clatter of hoof-clipped stones and scrape of gravel down the hidden &ldquo;siding&rdquo;,
    and the low sound of men&rsquo;s voices, blurred and speaking in monosyllables
    and at intervals it seemed, and in hushed, awed tones, as though they carried
    a corpse. To practical eyes, grown used to such a darkness, and at the nearest
    point, the passing blurs would have suggested two riders on bush hacks leading
    a third with an empty saddle on its back&mdash;a lady&rsquo;s or &ldquo;side-saddle&rdquo;,
    if one could have distinguished the horns. They may have struck a soft track
    or level, or rounded the buttress of the hill higher up, but before they
    had time to reach or round the foot of the spur, blurs, whispers, stumble
    and clatter of hoofs, jingle of bridle rings, and the occasional clank together
    of stirrup irons, seemed shut off as suddenly and completely as though a
    great sound-proof door had swung to behind them.</p>
  <p>It was dark enough on the glaringest of days down in the lonely hollow or &ldquo;pocket&rdquo;,
    between two spurs, at the head of a blind gully behind Mount Buckaroo, where
    there was a more or less dusty patch, barely defined even in broad daylight
    by a spidery dog-legged fence on three sides, and a thin  &ldquo;two-rail&rdquo; (dignified
    with the adjective &ldquo;split-rail&rdquo;&mdash;though rails and posts
    were mostly of saplings split in halves) running along the frontage. In about
    the middle of it a little slab hut, overshadowed by a big stringy-bark shed,
    was pointed out as Johnny Mears&rsquo;s Farm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Black as&mdash;as charcoal,&rdquo; said Johnny Mears. He had never
    seen coal, and was a cautious man, whose ideas came slowly. He stooped, close
    by the fence, with his hands on his knees, to &ldquo;sky&rdquo; the loom
    of his big shed and so get his bearings. He had been to have a look at the
    penned calves, and see that all slip-rails were up and pegged, for the words
    of John Mears junior, especially when delivered rapidly and shrilly and in
    injured tones, were not to be relied upon in these matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot enough to melt the belly out of my fiddle,&rdquo; said
    Johnny Mears to his wife, who sat on a three-legged stool by the rough table
    in the little whitewashed &ldquo;end-room&rdquo;, putting a patch of patches
    over the seat of a pair of moleskin knickerbockers. He lit his pipe, moved
    a stool to the side of the great empty fireplace, where it looked cooler&mdash;might
    have been cooler on account of a possible draught suggested by the presence
    of the chimney, and where, therefore, he felt a breath cooler. He took his
    fiddle from a convenient shelf, tuned it slowly and carefully, holding his
    pipe (in his mouth) well up and to one side, as if the fiddle were an inquisitive
    and restless baby. He played &ldquo;Little Drops o&rsquo; Brandy&rdquo; three
    times, right through, without variations, blinking solemnly the while; then
    he put the violin carefully back in its box, and started to cut up another
    pipeful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have gone, Johnny,&rdquo; said the haggard little woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rackin&rsquo; the horse out a night like this,&rdquo; retorted Johnny, &ldquo;and
    startin&rsquo; ploughin&rsquo; to-morrow. It ain&rsquo;t worth while. Let
    them come for me if they want me. Dance on a night like this! Why! they&rsquo;ll
    dance in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you promised. It won&rsquo;t do you no good, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do me no harm.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The little woman went on stitching.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s smotherin&rsquo; hot,&rdquo; said Johnny, with an impatient
    oath. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll turn in, or turn out,
    under the shed to-night. It&rsquo;s too d&mdash;d hot to roost indoors.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She bent her head lower over the patch. One smoked and the other stitched
    in silence for twenty minutes or so, during which time Johnny might be supposed
    to have been deliberating listlessly as to whether he&rsquo;d camp out on
    account of the heat, or turn in. But he broke the silence with a clout at
    a mosquito on the nape of his neck, and a bad word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t swear so much, Johnny,&rdquo; she said
    wearily&mdash;&ldquo;at least not to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked at her blankly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;why to-night? What&rsquo;s the matter with you to-night,
    Mary? What&rsquo;s to-night more than any other night to you? I see no harm&mdash;can&rsquo;t
    a man swear when a mosquito sticks him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was only thinking of the boys, Johnny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boys! Why, they&rsquo;re both on the hay in the shed.&rdquo; He
    stared at her again, shifted uneasily, crossed the other leg tightly, frowned,
    blinked, and reached for the matches. &ldquo;You look a bit off-colour, Mary.
    It&rsquo;s the heat that makes us all a bit ratty at times. Better put that
    by and have a swill o&rsquo;  oatmeal and water, and turn in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too hot to go to bed. I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I&rsquo;m
    all right. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll just finish this. Just reach me a
    drink from the water-bag&mdash;the pannikin&rsquo;s on the hob there, by
    your boot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He scratched his head helplessly, and reached for the drink. When he sat
    down again, he felt strangely restless. &ldquo;Like a hen that didn&rsquo;t
    know where to lay,&rdquo; he put it. He couldn&rsquo;t settle down or keep
    still, and didn&rsquo;t seem to enjoy his pipe somehow. He rubbed his head
    again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a thunderstorm comin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
    what it is; and the sooner it comes the better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He went to the back door, and stared at the blackness to the east, and,
    sure enough, lightning was blinking there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming, sure enough; just hang out and keep cool for another
    hour, and you&rsquo;ll feel the difference.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He sat down again on the three-legged stool, folded his arms, with his elbows
    on his knees, drew a long breath, and blinked at the clay floor for a while;
    then he twisted the stool round on one leg, until he faced the old-fashioned
    spired wooden clock (the brass disc of the pendulum moving ghost-like through
    a scarred and scratched marine scene&mdash;Margate in England&mdash;on the
    glass that covered the lower half) that stood alone on the slab shelf over
    the fireplace. The hands indicated half-past two, and Johnny, who had studied
    that clock and could &ldquo;hit the time nigh enough by it,&rdquo; after
    knitting his brows and blinking at the dial for a full minute by its own
    hand, decided &ldquo;that it must be getting on toward nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It must have been the heat. Johnny stood up, raking his hair, turned to
    the door and back again, and then, after an impatient gesture, took up his
    fiddle and raised it to his shoulder. Then the queer thing happened. He said
    afterwards, under conditions favourable to such sentimental confidence, that
    a cold hand seemed to take hold of the bow, through his, and&mdash;anyway,
    before he knew what he was about he had played the first bars of &ldquo;When
    First I Met Sweet Peggy&rdquo;, a tune he had played often, twenty years
    before, in his courting days, and had never happened to play since. He sawed
    it right through (the cold hand left after the first bar or two) standing
    up; then still stood with fiddle and bow trembling in his hands, with the
    queer feeling still on him, and a rush of old thoughts going through his
    head, all of which he set down afterwards to the effect of the heat. He put
    the fiddle away hastily, damning the bridge of it at the same time in loud
    but hurried tones, with the idea of covering any eccentricity which the wife
    might have noticed in his actions. &ldquo;Must &rsquo;a&rsquo; got a touch
    o&rsquo; sun,&rdquo; he muttered to himself. He sat down, fumbled with knife,
    pipe, and tobacco, and presently stole a furtive glance over his shoulder
    at his wife.</p>
  <p>The washed-out little woman was still sewing, but stitching blindly, for
    great tears were rolling down her worn cheeks.</p>
  <p>Johnny, white-faced on account of the heat, stood close behind her, one
    hand on her shoulder and the other clenched on the table; but the clenched
    hand shook as badly as the loose one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! What is the matter, Mary? You&rsquo;re sick!&rdquo; (They
    had had little or no experience of illness.) &ldquo;Tell me, Mary&mdash;come
    now! Has the boys been up to anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Johnny; it&rsquo;s not that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it then? You&rsquo;re taken sick! What have you been doing
    with yourself? It might be fever. Hold up a minute. You wait here quiet while
    I roost out the boys and send &rsquo;em for the doctor and someone&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No! no! I&rsquo;m not sick, John. It&rsquo;s only a turn. I&rsquo;ll
    be all right in a minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He shifted his hand to her head, which she dropped suddenly, with a life-weary
    sigh, against his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now then!&rdquo; cried Johnny, wildly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you faint
    or go into disterricks, Mary! It&rsquo;ll upset the boys; think of the boys!
    It&rsquo;s only the heat&mdash;you&rsquo;re only takin&rsquo; queer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that; you ought to know me better than that. It was&mdash;I&mdash;Johnny,
    I was only thinking&mdash;we&rsquo;ve been married twenty years to-night&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    New Year&rsquo;s Night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve never thought of it!&rdquo; said Johnny (in the afterwards).  &ldquo;Shows
    what a God-forgotten selection will make of a man. She&rsquo;d thought of
    it all the time, and was waiting for it to strike me. Why! I&rsquo;d agreed
    to go and play at a darnce at Old Pipeclay School-house all night&mdash;that
    very night&mdash;and leave her at home because she hadn&rsquo;t asked to
    come; and it never struck me to ask her&mdash;at home by herself in that
    hole&mdash;for twenty-five bob. And I only stopped at home because I&rsquo;d
    got the hump, and knew they&rsquo;d want me bad at the school.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They sat close together on the long stool by the table, shy and awkward
    at first; and she clung to him at opening of thunder, and they started apart
    guiltily when the first great drops sounded like footsteps on the gravel
    outside, just as they&rsquo;d done one night-time before&mdash;twenty years
    before.</p>
  <p>If it was dark before, it was black now. The edge of the awful storm-cloud
    rushed up and under the original darkness like the best &ldquo;drop&rdquo;  black-brushed
    over the cheap &ldquo;lamp&rdquo; variety, turning it grey by contrast. The
    deluge lasted only a quarter of an hour; but it cleared the night, and did
    its work. There was hail before it, too&mdash;big as emu eggs, the boys said&mdash;that
    lay feet deep in the old diggers&rsquo; holes on Pipeclay for days afterwards&mdash;weeks
    some said.</p>
  <p>The two sweethearts of twenty years ago and to-night watched the retreat
    of the storm, and, seeing Mount Buckaroo standing clear, they went to the
    back door, which opened opposite the end of the shed, and saw to the east
    a glorious arch of steel-blue, starry sky, with the distant peaks showing
    clear and blue away back under the far-away stars in the depth of it.</p>
  <p>They lingered awhile&mdash;arms round each other&rsquo;s waists&mdash;before
    she called the boys, just as they had done this time of night twenty years
    ago, after the boys&rsquo; grandmother had called her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Awlright, mother!&rdquo; bawled back the boys, with unfilial independence
    of Australian youth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re awlright! We&rsquo;ll be in directly!
    Wasn&rsquo;t it a pelterer, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They went in and sat down again. The embarrassment began to wear off.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get out of this, Mary,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take Mason&rsquo;s offer for the cattle and things, and take that job of
    Dawson&rsquo;s, boss or no boss&rdquo;&mdash;(Johnny&rsquo;s bad luck was
    due to his inability in the past to &ldquo;get on&rdquo; with any boss for
    any reasonable length of time)&mdash;&ldquo;I can get the boys on, too. They&rsquo;re
    doing no good here, and growing up. It ain&rsquo;t doing justice to them;
    and, what&rsquo;s more, this life is killin&rsquo; you, Mary. That settles
    it! I was blind. Let the jumpt-up selection go! It&rsquo;s making a wall-eyed
    bullock of me, Mary&mdash;a dry-rotted rag of a wall-eyed bullock like Jimmy
    Nowlett&rsquo;s old Strawberry. And you&rsquo;ll live in town like a lady.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somebody coming!&rdquo; yelled the boys.</p>
  <p>There was a clatter of sliprails hurriedly thrown down, and clipped by horses&rsquo; hoofs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Insoide there! Is that you, Johnny?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; (&ldquo;I knew they&rsquo;d come for you,&rdquo; said
    Mrs. Mears to Johnny.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to come, Johnny. There&rsquo;s no get out of it.
    Here&rsquo;s Jim Mason with me, and we&rsquo;ve got orders to stun you and
    pack you if you show fight. The blessed fiddler from Mudgee didn&rsquo;t
    turn up. Dave Regan burst his concertina, and they&rsquo;re in a fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t leave the missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. We&rsquo;ve got the school missus&rsquo;s
    mare and side-saddle. She says you ought to be jolly well ashamed of yourself,
    Johnny Mears, for not bringing your wife on New Year&rsquo;s Night. And so
    you ought!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Johnny did not look shame-faced, for reasons unknown to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boys couldn&rsquo;t find the horses,&rdquo; put in Mrs. Mears. &ldquo;Johnny
    was just going down the gully again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He gave her a grateful look, and felt a strange, new thrill of admiration
    for his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;there&rsquo;s a bottle of the best put by for you, Johnny,&rdquo; added
    Pat McDurmer, mistaking Johnny&rsquo;s silence; &ldquo;and we&rsquo;ll call
    it thirty bob!&rdquo;  (Johnny&rsquo;s ideas were coming slowly again, after
    the recent rush.) &ldquo;Or&mdash;two quid!&mdash;there you are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want two quid, nor one either, for taking my wife to
    a dance on New Year&rsquo;s Night!&rdquo; said Johnny Mears. &ldquo;Run and
    put on your best bib and tucker, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And she hurried to dress as eager and excited, and smiling to herself as
    girlishly as she had done on such occasions on evenings before the bright
    New Year&rsquo;s Night twenty years ago.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BlackJoe"></a>Black Joe</b></h2>
  <p>They called him Black Joe, and me White Joe, by way of distinction and for
    the convenience of his boss (my uncle), and my aunt, and mother; so, when
    we heard the cry of &ldquo;Bla-a-ack Joe!&rdquo; (the adjective drawn out
    until it became a screech, after several repetitions, and the &ldquo;Joe&rdquo; short
    and sharp) coming across the flat in a woman&rsquo;s voice, Joe knew that
    the missus wanted him at the house, to get wood or water, or mind the baby,
    and he kept carefully out of sight; he went at once when uncle called. And
    when we heard the cry of  &ldquo;Wh-i-i-te Joe!&rdquo; which we did with
    difficulty and after several tries&mdash;though Black Joe&rsquo;s ears were
    of the keenest&mdash;we knew that I was overdue at home, or absent without
    leave, and was probably in for a warming, as the old folk called it. On some
    occasions I postponed the warming as long as my stomach held out, which was
    a good while in five-corner, native-cherry, or yam season&mdash;but the warming
    was none the cooler for being postponed.</p>
  <p>Sometimes Joe heard the wrong adjective, or led me to believe he did&mdash;and
    left me for a whole afternoon under the impression that the race of Ham was
    in demand at the homestead, when I myself was wanted there, and maternal
    wrath was increasing every moment of my absence.</p>
  <p>But Joe knew that my conscience was not so elastic as his, and&mdash;well,
    you must expect little things like this in all friendships.</p>
  <p>Black Joe was somewhere between nine and twelve when I first met him, on
    a visit to my uncle&rsquo;s station; I was somewhere in those years too.
    He was very black, the darker for being engaged in the interesting but uncertain
    occupation of &ldquo;burning off&rdquo; in his spare time&mdash;which wasn&rsquo;t
    particularly limited. He combined shepherding, &rsquo;possum and kangaroo
    hunting, crawfishing, sleeping, and various other occupations and engagements
    with that of burning off. I was very white, being a sickly town boy; but,
    as I took great interest in burning off, and was not particularly fond of
    cold water&mdash;it was in winter time&mdash;the difference in our complexions
    was not so marked at times.</p>
  <p>Black Joe&rsquo;s father, old Black Jimmie, lived in a gunyah on the rise
    at the back of the sheepyards, and shepherded for my uncle. He was a gentle,
    good-humoured, easy-going old fellow with a pleasant smile; which description
    applies, I think, to most old blackfellows in civilisation. I was very partial
    to the old man, and chummy with him, and used to slip away from the homestead
    whenever I could, and squat by the campfire along with the other piccaninnies,
    and think, and yarn socially with Black Jimmie by the hour. I would give
    something to remember those conversations now. Sometimes somebody would be
    sent to bring me home, when it got too late, and Black Jimmie would say:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Piccaninnie alonga possum rug,&rdquo; and there I&rsquo;d be, sound
    asleep, with the other young Australians.</p>
  <p>I liked Black Jimmie very much, and would willingly have adopted him as
    a father. I should have been quite content to spend my days in the scrub,
    enjoying life in dark and savage ways, and my nights &ldquo;alonga possum
    rug&rdquo;; but the family had other plans for my future.</p>
  <p>It was a case of two blackfellows and one gin, when Black Jimmie went a-wooing&mdash;about
    twelve years before I made his acquaintance&mdash;and he fought for his bride
    in the black fashion. It was the last affair of that kind in the district.
    My uncle&rsquo;s brother professed to have been present at the fight, and
    gave me an alleged description of it. He said that they drew lots, and Black
    Jimmie put his hands on his knees and bent his head, and the other blackfellow
    hit him a whack on the skull with a nulla nulla. Then they had a nip of rum
    all round&mdash;Black Jimmie must have wanted it, for the nulla nulla was
    knotted, and heavy, and made in the most approved fashion. Then the other
    blackfellow bent his head, and Jimmie took the club and returned the whack
    with interest. Then the other fellow hit Jimmie a lick, and took a clout
    in return. Then they had another drink, and continued thus until Jimmie&rsquo;s
    rival lost all heart and interest in the business. But you couldn&rsquo;t
    take everything my uncle&rsquo;s brother said for granted.</p>
  <p>Black Mary was a queen by right, and had the reputation of being the cleanest
    gin in the district; she was a great favourite with the squatters&rsquo;  wives
    round there. Perhaps she hoped to reclaim Jimmie&mdash;he was royal, too,
    but held easy views with regard to religion and the conventionalities of
    civilisation. Mary insisted on being married properly by a clergyman, made
    the old man build a decent hut, had all her children christened, and kept
    him and them clean and tidy up to the time of her death.</p>
  <p>Poor Queen Mary was ambitious. She started to educate her children, and
    when they got beyond her&mdash;that is when they had learnt their letters&mdash;she
    was grateful for any assistance from the good-natured bush men and women
    of her acquaintance. She had decided to get her eldest boy into the mounted
    police, and had plans for the rest, and she worked hard for them, too. Jimmie
    offered no opposition, and gave her no assistance beyond the rations and
    money he earned shepherding&mdash;which was as much as could be expected
    of him.</p>
  <p>He did as many husbands do &ldquo;for the sake of peace and quietness&rdquo;&mdash;he
    drifted along in the wake of his wife, and took things as easily as her schemes
    of reformation and education would allow him to.</p>
  <p>Queen Mary died before her time, respected by all who knew or had heard
    of her. The nearest squatter&rsquo;s wife sent a pair of sheets for a shroud,
    with instructions to lay Mary out, and arranged (by bush telegraph) to drive
    over next morning with her sister-in-law and two other white women in the
    vicinity, to see Mary decently buried.</p>
  <p>But the remnant of Jimmie&rsquo;s tribe were there beforehand. They tore
    the sheets in strips and tied Mary up in a bundle, with her chin to her knees&mdash;preparing
    her for burial in their own fashion&mdash;and mourned all night in whitewash
    and ashes. At least, the gins did. The white women saw that it was hopeless
    to attempt to untie any of the innumerable knots and double knots, even if
    it had been possible to lay Mary out afterwards; so they had to let her be
    buried as she was, with black and white obsequies. And we&rsquo;ve got no
    interest in believing that she did not &ldquo;jump up white woman&rdquo; long
    ago.</p>
  <p>My uncle and his brother took the two eldest boys. Black Jimmie shifted
    away from the hut at once with the rest of his family&mdash;for the  &ldquo;devil-devil&rdquo; sat
    down there&mdash;and Mary&rsquo;s name was strictly &ldquo;tabooed&rdquo; in
    accordance with aboriginal etiquette.</p>
  <p>Jimmie drifted back towards the graves of his fathers in company with a
    decreasing flock of sheep day by day (for the house of my uncle had fallen
    on times of drought and depression, and foot-rot and wool rings, and over-drafts
    and bank owners), and a few strips of bark, a dying fire, a black pipe, some
    greasy &rsquo;possum rugs and blankets, a litter of kangaroo tails, etc.,
    four neglected piccaninnies, half a score of mangy mongrels, and, haply,
    a  &ldquo;lilly drap o&rsquo; rum&rdquo;, by night.</p>
  <p>The four little Australians grew dirtier and more shy and savage, and ate
    underdone kangaroo and &rsquo;possum and native bear, with an occasional
    treat of oak grubs and goanna by preference&mdash;and died out, one by one,
    as blacks do when brought within the ever widening circle of civilisation.
    Jimmie moved promptly after each death, and left the evil one in possession,
    and built another mia-mia&mdash;each one being less pretentious than the
    last. Finally he was left, the last of his tribe, to mourn his lot in solitude.</p>
  <p>But the devil-devil came and sat down by King Jimmie&rsquo;s side one night,
    so he, too, moved out across the Old Man border, and the mia-mia rotted into
    the ground and the grass grew there.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>I admired Joe; I thought him wiser and cleverer than any white boy in the
    world. He could smell out &rsquo;possums unerringly, and I firmly believed
    he could see yards through the muddiest of dam water; for once, when I dropped
    my boat in, and was not sure of the spot, he fished it out first try. With
    cotton reels and bits of stick and bark he would make the model of a station
    homestead, slaughter-yards, sheep-yards, and all complete, working in ideas
    and improvements of his own which might have been put into practice with
    advantage. He was a most original and interesting liar upon all subjects
    upon which he was ignorant and which came up incidentally. He gave me a very
    interesting account of an interview between his father and Queen Victoria,
    and mentioned casually that his father had walked across the Thames without
    getting wet.</p>
  <p>He also told me how he, Joe, had tied a mounted trooper to a verandah post
    and thrashed him with pine saplings until the timber gave out and he was
    tired. I questioned Jimmie, but the incidents seemed to have escaped the
    old king&rsquo;s memory.</p>
  <p>Joe could build bigger woodheaps with less wood than any black or white
    tramp or loafer round there. He was a born architect. He took a world of
    pains with his wood-heaps&mdash;he built them hollow, in the shape of a break-wind,
    with the convex side towards the house for the benefit of his employers.
    Joe was easy-going; he had inherited a love of peace and quietness from his
    father. Uncle generally came home after dark, and Joe would have little fires
    lit at safe distances all round the house, in order to convey an impression
    that the burning off was proceeding satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>When the warm weather came, Joe and I got into trouble with an old hag for
    bathing in a waterhole in the creek in front of her shanty, and she impounded
    portions of our wardrobe. We shouldn&rsquo;t have lost much if she had taken
    it all; but our sense of injury was deep, especially as she used very bad
    grammar towards us.</p>
  <p>Joe addressed her from the safe side of the water. He said, &ldquo;Look
    here! Old leather-face, sugar-eye, plar-bag marmy, I call it you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plar-bag marmy&rdquo; meant &ldquo;Mother Flour-bag&rdquo;, and ration
    sugar was decidedly muddy in appearance.</p>
  <p>She came round the waterhole with a clothes prop, and made good time, too;
    but we got across and away with our clothes.</p>
  <p>That little incident might have changed the whole course of my existence.
    Plar-bag Marmy made a formal complaint to uncle, who happened to pass there
    on horseback about an hour later; and the same evening Joe&rsquo;s latest
    and most carefully planned wood heap collapsed while aunt was pulling a stick
    out of it in the dark, and it gave her a bad scare, the results of which
    might have been serious.</p>
  <p>So uncle gave us a thrashing, without the slightest regard for racial distinctions,
    and sent us to bed without our suppers.</p>
  <p>We sought Jimmie&rsquo;s camp, but Joe got neither sympathy nor damper from
    his father, and I was sent home with a fatherly lecture &ldquo;for going
    alonga that fella,&rdquo; meaning Joe.</p>
  <p>Joe and I discussed existence at a waterhole down the creek next afternoon,
    over a billy of crawfish which we had boiled and a piece of gritty damper,
    and decided to retire beyond the settled districts&mdash;some five hundred
    miles or so&mdash;to a place that Joe said he knew of, where there were lagoons
    and billabongs ten miles wide, alive with ducks and fish, and black cockatoos
    and kangaroos and wombats, that only waited to be knocked over with a stick.</p>
  <p>I thought I might as well start and be a blackfellow at once, so we got
    a rusty pan without a handle, and cooked about a pint of fat yellow oak-grubs;
    and I was about to fall to when we were discovered, and the full weight of
    combined family influence was brought to bear on the situation. We had broken
    a new pair of shears digging out those grubs from under the bark of the she-oaks,
    and had each taken a blade as his own especial property, which we thought
    was the best thing to do under the circumstances. Uncle wanted those shears
    badly, so he received us with the buggy whip&mdash;and he didn&rsquo;t draw
    the colour line either. All that night and next day I wished he had. I was
    sent home, and Joe went droving with uncle soon after that, else I might
    have lived a life of freedom and content and died out peacefully with the
    last of my adopted tribe.</p>
  <p>Joe died of consumption on the track. When he was dying uncle asked: &ldquo;Is
    there anything you would like?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And Joe said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like a lilly drap o&rsquo; rum, boss.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Which were his last words, for he drank the rum and died peacefully.</p>
  <p>I was the first to hear the news at home, and, being still a youngster,
    I ran to the house, crying &ldquo;Oh, mother! aunt&rsquo;s Joe is dead!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were visitors at our place at the time, and, as the eldest child of
    the maternal aunt in question had also been christened Joe&mdash;after a
    grandfather of our tribe (my tribe, not Black Joe&rsquo;s)&mdash;the news
    caused a sudden and unpleasant sensation. But cross-examination explained
    the mistake, and I retired to the rear of the pig-sty, as was my custom when
    things went wrong, with another cause for grief.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheyWaitontheWharfinBlack"></a>They Wait on

  <p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Seems to me that honest, hard-working men seem to
      accumulate the heaviest swags of trouble in this world.&rdquo;&mdash;Steelman.</i></p>
  <p align="center" class="note">Told by Mitchell&rsquo;s Mate.</p>
  <p>We were coming back from West Australia, steerage&mdash;Mitchell, the Oracle,
    and I. I had gone over saloon, with a few pounds in my pocket. Mitchell said
    this was a great mistake&mdash;I should have gone over steerage with nothing
    but the clothes I stood upright in, and come back saloon with a pile. He
    said it was a very common mistake that men made, but, as far as his experience
    went, there always seemed to be a deep-rooted popular prejudice in favour
    of going away from home with a few pounds in one&rsquo;s pocket and coming
    back stumped; at least amongst rovers and vagabonds like ourselves&mdash;it
    wasn&rsquo;t so generally popular or admired at home, or in the places we
    came back to, as it was in the places we went to. Anyway it went, there wasn&rsquo;t
    the slightest doubt that our nearest and dearest friends were, as a rule,
    in favour of our taking away as little as we could possibly manage with,
    and coming back with a pile, whether we came back saloon or not; and that
    ought to settle the matter as far as any chap that had the slightest consideration
    for his friends or family was concerned.</p>
  <p>There was a good deal of misery, underneath, coming home in that steerage.
    One man had had his hand crushed and amputated out Coolgardie way, and the
    stump had mortified, and he was being sent to Melbourne by his mates. Some
    had lost their money, some a couple of years of their life, some their souls;
    but none seemed to have lost the heart to call up the quiet grin that southern
    rovers, vagabonds, travellers for &ldquo;graft&rdquo; or fortune, and professional
    wanderers wear in front of it all. Except one man&mdash;an elderly eastern
    digger&mdash;he had lost his wife in Sydney while he was away.</p>
  <p>They sent him a wire to the Boulder Soak, or somewhere out back of White
    Feather, to say that his wife was seriously ill; but the wire went wrong,
    somehow, after the manner of telegrams not connected with mining, on the
    lines of &ldquo;the Western&rdquo;. They sent him a wire to say that his
    wife was dead, and that reached him all right&mdash;only a week late.</p>
  <p>I can imagine it. He got the message at dinner-time, or when they came back
    to the camp. His mate wanted him to sit in the shade, or lie in the tent,
    while he got the billy boiled. &ldquo;You must brace up and pull yourself
    together, Tom, for the sake of the youngsters.&rdquo; And Tom for long intervals
    goes walking up and down, up and down, by the camp&mdash;under the brassy
    sky or the gloaming&mdash;under the brilliant star-clusters that hang over
    the desert plain, but never raising his eyes to them; kicking a tuft of grass
    or a hole in the sand now and then, and seeming to watch the progress of
    the track he is tramping out. The wife of twenty years was with him&mdash;though
    two thousand miles away&mdash;till that message came.</p>
  <p>I can imagine Tom sitting with his mates round the billy, they talking in
    quiet, subdued tones about the track, the departure of coaches, trains and
    boats&mdash;arranging for Tom&rsquo;s journey East, and the working of the
    claim in his absence. Or Tom lying on his back in his bunk, with his hands
    under his head and his eyes fixed on the calico above&mdash;thinking, thinking,
    thinking. Thinking, with a touch of his boyhood&rsquo;s faith perhaps; or
    wondering what he had done in his long, hard-working married life, that God
    should do this thing to him now, of all times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d best take what money we have in the camp, Tom; you&rsquo;ll
    want it all ag&rsquo;in&rsquo; the time you get back from Sydney, and we
    can fix it up arterwards.... There&rsquo;s a couple o&rsquo; clean shirts
    o&rsquo; mine&mdash;you&rsquo;d best take &rsquo;em&mdash;you&rsquo;ll want &rsquo;em
    on the voyage.... You might as well take them there new pants o&rsquo; mine,
    they&rsquo;ll only dry-rot out here&mdash;and the coat, too, if you like&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    too small for me, anyway. You won&rsquo;t have any time in Perth, and you&rsquo;ll
    want some decent togs to land with in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; cared so much if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; seen
    the last of her,&rdquo; he said, in a quiet, patient voice, to us one night
    by the rail. &ldquo;I would &rsquo;a&rsquo;  liked to have seen the last
    of her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you been long in the West?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Over two years. I made up to take a run across last Christmas, and
    have a look at &rsquo;em. But I couldn&rsquo;t very well get away when &lsquo;exemption-time&rsquo;  came.
    I didn&rsquo;t like to leave the claim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do any good over there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things brightened up a bit the last month or two. I had a hard
    pull at first; landed without a penny, and had to send back every shilling
    I could rake up to get things straightened up a bit at home. Then the eldest
    boy fell ill, and then the baby. I&rsquo;d reckoned on bringing &rsquo;em
    over to Perth or Coolgardie when the cool weather came, and having them somewheres
    near me, where I could go and have a look at &rsquo;em now and then, and
    look after them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Going back to the West again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. I must go for the sake of the youngsters. But I don&rsquo;t
    seem to have much heart in it.&rdquo; He smoked awhile. &ldquo;Over twenty
    years we struggled along together&mdash;the missus and me&mdash;and it seems
    hard that I couldn&rsquo;t see the last of her. It&rsquo;s rough on a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The world is damned rough on a man sometimes,&rdquo; said Mitchell,  &ldquo;most
    especially when he least deserves it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The digger crossed his arms on the rail like an old &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; at
    the fence in the cool of the evening, yarning with an old crony.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mor&rsquo;n twenty years she stuck to me and struggled along by my
    side. She never give in. I&rsquo;ll swear she was on her feet till the last,
    with her sleeves tucked up&mdash;bustlin&rsquo; round.... And just when things
    was brightening and I saw a chance of giving her a bit of a rest and comfort
    for the end of her life.... I thought of it all only t&rsquo;other week when
    things was clearing up ahead; and the last &lsquo;order&rsquo; I sent over
    I set to work and wrote her a long letter, putting all the good news and
    encouragement I could think of into it. I thought how that letter would brighten
    up things at home, and how she&rsquo;d read it round. I thought of lots of
    things that a man never gets time to think of while his nose is kept to the
    grindstone. And she was dead and in her grave, and I never knowed it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell dug his elbow into my ribs and made signs for the matches to light
    his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; yer never knowed,&rdquo; reflected the Oracle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I always had an idea when there was trouble at home,&rdquo; the
    digger went on presently, in his quiet, patient tone. &ldquo;I always knowed;
    I always had a kind of feeling that way&mdash;I felt it&mdash;no matter how
    far I was away. When the youngsters was sick I knowed it, and I expected
    the letter that come. About a fortnight ago I had a feeling that way when
    the wife was ill. The very stars out there on the desert by the Boulder Soak
    seemed to say: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s trouble at home. Go home. There&rsquo;s
    trouble at home.&rsquo; But I never dreamed what that trouble was. One night
    I did make up my mind to start in the morning, but when the morning came
    I hadn&rsquo;t an excuse, and was ashamed to tell my mates the truth. They
    might have thought I was going ratty, like a good many go out there.&rdquo; Then
    he broke off with a sort of laugh, as if it just struck him that we might
    think he was a bit off his head, or that his talk was getting uncomfortable
    for us. &ldquo;Curious, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me of a case I knowed,&mdash;&rdquo; commenced the Oracle,
    after a pause.</p>
  <p>I could have pitched him overboard; but that was a mistake. He and the old
    digger sat on the for&rsquo;ard hatch half the night yarning, mostly about
    queer starts, and rum go&rsquo;s, and curious cases the Oracle had knowed,
    and I think the Oracle did him a lot of good somehow, for he seemed more
    cheerful in the morning.</p>
  <p>We were overcrowded in the steerage, but Mitchell managed to give up his
    berth to the old digger without letting him know it. Most of the chaps seemed
    anxious to make a place at the first table and pass the first helpings of
    the dishes to the &ldquo;old cove that had lost his missus.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all seemed to forget him as we entered the Heads; they had their own
    troubles to attend to. They were in the shadow of the shame of coming back
    hard up, and the grins began to grow faint and sickly. But I didn&rsquo;t
    forget him. I wish sometimes that I didn&rsquo;t take so much notice of things.</p>
  <p>There was no mistaking them&mdash;the little group that stood apart near
    the end of the wharf, dressed in cheap black. There was the eldest single
    sister&mdash;thin, pale, and haggard-looking&mdash;that had had all the hard
    worry in the family till her temper was spoilt, as you could see by the peevish,
    irritable lines in her face. She had to be the mother of them all now, and
    had never known, perhaps, what it was to be a girl or a sweetheart. She gave
    a hard, mechanical sort of smile when she saw her father, and then stood
    looking at the boat in a vacant, hopeless sort of way. There was the baby,
    that he saw now for the first time, crowing and jumping at the sight of the
    boat coming in; there was the eldest boy, looking awkward and out of place
    in his new slop-suit of black, shifting round uneasily, and looking anywhere
    but at his father. But the little girl was the worst, and a pretty little
    girl she was, too; she never took her streaming eyes off her father&rsquo;s
    face the whole time. You could see that her little heart was bursting, and
    with pity for him. They were too far apart to speak to each other as yet.
    The boat seemed a cruel long long time swinging alongside&mdash;I wished
    they&rsquo;d hurry up. He&rsquo;d brought his traps up early, and laid &rsquo;em
    on the deck under the rail; he stood very quiet with his hands behind him,
    looking at his children. He had a strong, square, workman&rsquo;s face, but
    I could see his chin and mouth quivering under the stubbly, iron-grey beard,
    and the lump working in his throat; and one strong hand gripped the other
    very tight behind, but his eyelids never quivered&mdash;only his eyes seemed
    to grow more and more sad and lonesome. These are the sort of long, cruel
    moments when a man sits or stands very tight and quiet and calm-looking,
    with his whole past life going whirling through his brain, year after year,
    and over and over again. Just as the digger seemed about to speak to them
    he met the brimming eyes of his little girl turned up to his face. He looked
    at her for a moment, and then turned suddenly and went below as if pretending
    to go down for his things. I noticed that Mitchell&mdash;who hadn&rsquo;t
    seemed to be noticing anything in particular&mdash;followed him down. When
    they came on deck again we were right alongside.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Nell!&rdquo; said the digger to the eldest daughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, father!&rdquo; she said, with a sort of gasp, but trying
    to smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello, Jack, how are you getting on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, father,&rdquo; said the boy, brightening up, and seeming
    greatly relieved.</p>
  <p>He looked down at the little girl with a smile that I can&rsquo;t describe,
    but didn&rsquo;t speak to her. She still stood with quivering chin and mouth
    and great brimming eyes upturned, full of such pity as I never saw before
    in a child-face&mdash;pity for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can get ashore now,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;see, they&rsquo;ve
    got the gangway out aft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Presently I saw Mitchell with the portmanteau in his hand, and the baby
    on his arm, steering them away to a quiet corner of the shed at the top of
    the wharf. The digger had the little girl in his arms, and both hers were
    round his neck, and her face hidden on his shoulder.</p>
  <p>When Mitchell came back, he leant on the rail for a while by my side, as
    if it was a boundary fence out back, and there was no hurry to break up camp
    and make a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did you follow him below that time for, Mitchell?&rdquo; I asked
    presently, for want of something better to say.</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked at me out of the corners of his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wanted to score a drink!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought he wanted
    one and wouldn&rsquo;t like to be a Jimmy Woodser.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SeeingtheLastofYou"></a>Seeing the Last of You</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re going away by boat,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you
    ought to say good-bye to the women at home, and to the chaps at the last
    pub. I hate waiting on the wharf or up on deck when the boat&rsquo;s behind
    time. There&rsquo;s no sense in it, and a lot of unnecessary misery. Your
    friends wait on the wharf and you are kept at the rail to the bitter end,
    just when they and you most want a spell. And why? Some of them hang out
    because they love you, and want to see the last of you; some because they
    don&rsquo;t like you to see them going away without seeing the last of you;
    and you hang out mostly because it would hurt &rsquo;em if you went below
    and didn&rsquo;t give them a chance of seeing the last of you all the time&mdash;and
    you curse the boat and wish to God it would start. And those who love you
    most&mdash;the women-folk of the family&mdash;and who are making all the
    fuss and breaking their hearts about having to see the last of you, and least
    want to do it&mdash;they hang out the longest, and are the most determined
    to see it. Where&rsquo;s the sense in it? What&rsquo;s the good of seeing
    the last of you? How do women manage to get consolation out of a thing like
    that?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But women get consolation out of queer things sometimes,&rdquo; he
    added reflectively, &ldquo;and so do men.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember when I was knocking about the coasts, an old aunt of mine
    always persisted in coming down to see the last of me, and bringing the whole
    family too&mdash;no matter if I was only going away for a month. I was her
    favourite. I always turned up again in a few months; but if I&rsquo;d come
    back every next boat it wouldn&rsquo;t have made the slightest difference
    to her. She&rsquo;d say that I mightn&rsquo;t come back some day, and then
    she&rsquo;d never forgive herself nor the family for not seeing me off. I
    suppose she&rsquo;ll see the end of me yet if she lives long enough&mdash;and
    she&rsquo;s a wiry old lady of the old school. She was old-fashioned and
    dressed like a fright, they said at home. They hated being seen in public
    with her; to tell the truth, I felt a bit ashamed, too, at times. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    be, now. When I&rsquo;d get her off on to the wharf I&rsquo;d be overcome
    with my feelings, and have to retire to the privacy of the bar to hide my
    emotions till the boat was going. And she&rsquo;d stand on the end of the
    pier and wave her handkerchief and mop her old eyes with it until she was
    removed by force.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God bless her old heart! There wasn&rsquo;t so much affection wasted
    on me at home that I felt crowded by hers; and I never lost anything by her
    seeing the last of me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do wish the Oracle would stop that confounded fiddle of his&mdash;it
    makes you think over damned old things.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoBoysatGrinderBrothers"></a>Two Boys at Grinder
      Brothers&rsquo;</b></h2>
  <p>Five or six half-grown larrikins sat on the cemented sill of the big window
    of Grinder Bros.&rsquo; Railway Coach Factory waiting for the work bell,
    and one of the number was Bill Anderson&mdash;known as &ldquo;Carstor Hoil&rdquo;&mdash;a
    young terror of fourteen or fifteen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes Balmy Arvie,&rdquo; exclaimed Bill as a pale, timid-looking
    little fellow rounded the corner and stood against the wall by the door. &ldquo;How&rsquo;s
    your parents, Balmy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The boy made no answer; he shrank closer to the entrance. The first bell
    went.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What yer got for dinner, Balmy? Bread &rsquo;n&rsquo; treacle?&rdquo; asked
    the young ruffian; then for the edification of his chums he snatched the
    boy&rsquo;s dinner bag and emptied its contents on the pavement.</p>
  <p>The door opened. Arvie gathered up his lunch, took his time-ticket, and
    hurried in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Balmy,&rdquo; said one of the smiths as he passed, &ldquo;what
    do you think of the boat race?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the boy, goaded to reply, &ldquo;that it would
    be better if young fellows of this country didn&rsquo;t think so much about
    racin&rsquo; an&rsquo; fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The questioner stared blankly for a moment, then laughed suddenly in the
    boy&rsquo;s face, and turned away. The rest grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie&rsquo;s getting balmier than ever,&rdquo; guffawed young Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Carstor Hoil,&rdquo; cried one of the smiths&rsquo; strikers, &ldquo;how
    much oil will you take for a chew of terbaccer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Teaspoonful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right; let&rsquo;s see the chew, first.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;ll get it. What yer frighten&rsquo; of?... Come on,
    chaps, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  see Bill drink oil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill measured out some machine oil and drank it. He got the tobacco, and
    the others got what they called &ldquo;the fun of seein&rsquo; Bill drink
    oil!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The second bell rang, and Bill went up to the other end of the shop, where
    Arvie was already at work sweeping shavings from under a bench.</p>
  <p>The young terror seated himself on the end of this bench, drummed his heels
    against the leg, and whistled. He was in no hurry, for his foreman had not
    yet arrived. He amused himself by lazily tossing chips at Arvie, who made
    no protest for a while. &ldquo;It would be&mdash;better&mdash;for this country,&rdquo; said
    the young terror, reflectively and abstractedly, cocking his eye at the whitewashed
    roof beams and feeling behind him on the bench for a heavier chip&mdash;&ldquo;it
    would be better&mdash;for this country&mdash;if young fellers didn&rsquo;t
    think so much about&mdash;about&mdash;racin&rsquo;&mdash;<i>and</i> fightin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You let me alone,&rdquo; said Arvie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;ll you do?&rdquo; exclaimed Bill, bringing his eye
    down with feigned surprise. Then, in an indignant tone, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    mind takin&rsquo; a fall out of yer, now, if yer like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Arvie went on with his work. Bill tossed all the chips within reach, and
    then sat carelessly watching some men at work, and whistling the  &ldquo;Dead
    March&rdquo;. Presently he asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yer name, Balmy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t yer answer a civil question? I&rsquo;d soon knock the
    sulks out of yer if I was yer father.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My name&rsquo;s Arvie; you know that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arvie Aspinall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill cocked his eye at the roof and thought a while and whistled; then he
    said suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say, Balmy, where d&rsquo;yer live?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jones&rsquo; Alley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jones&rsquo; Alley.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A short, low whistle from Bill. &ldquo;What house?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Number Eight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Garn! What yer giv&rsquo;nus?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling the truth. What&rsquo;s there funny about it? What
    do I want to tell you a lie for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, we lived there once, Balmy. Old folks livin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother is; father&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill scratched the back of his head, protruded his under lip, and reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Arvie, what did yer father die of?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heart disease. He dropped down dead at his work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long, low, intense whistle from Bill. He wrinkled his forehead and stared
    up at the beams as if he expected to see something unusual there. After a
    while he said, very impressively: &ldquo;So did mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The coincidence hadn&rsquo;t done striking him yet; he wrestled with it
    for nearly a minute longer. Then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose yer mother goes out washin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; cleans offices?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So does mine. Any brothers &rsquo;n&rsquo; sisters?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two&mdash;one brother &rsquo;n&rsquo; one sister.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill looked relieved&mdash;for some reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I got nine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Yours younger&rsquo;n you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lot of bother with the landlord?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a good lot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Had any bailiffs in yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They compared notes a while longer, and tailed off into a silence which
    lasted three minutes and grew awkward towards the end.</p>
  <p>Bill fidgeted about on the bench, reached round for a chip, but recollected
    himself. Then he cocked his eye at the roof once more and whistled, twirling
    a shaving round his fingers the while. At last he tore the shaving in two,
    jerked it impatiently from him, and said abruptly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Arvie! I&rsquo;m sorry I knocked over yer barrer yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This knocked Bill out the first round. He rubbed round uneasily on the bench,
    fidgeted with the vise, drummed his fingers, whistled, and finally thrust
    his hands in his pockets and dropped on his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Arvie!&rdquo; he said in low, hurried tones. &ldquo;Keep
    close to me goin&rsquo; out to-night, &rsquo;n&rsquo; if any of the other
    chaps touches yer or says anything to yer I&rsquo;ll hit &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he swung himself round the corner of a carriage &ldquo;body&rdquo; and
    was gone.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Arvie was late out of the shop that evening. His boss was a sub-contractor
    for the coach-painting, and always tried to find twenty minutes&rsquo;  work
    for his boys just about five or ten minutes before the bell rang. He employed
    boys because they were cheap and he had a lot of rough work, and they could
    get under floors and &ldquo;bogies&rdquo; with their pots and brushes, and
    do all the  &ldquo;priming&rdquo; and paint the trucks. His name was Collins,
    and the boys were called  &ldquo;Collins&rsquo; Babies&rdquo;. It was a joke
    in the shop that he had a &ldquo;weaning&rdquo; contract. The boys were all &ldquo;over
    fourteen&rdquo;, of course, because of the Education Act. Some were nine
    or ten&mdash;wages from five shillings to ten shillings. It didn&rsquo;t
    matter to Grinder Brothers so long as the contracts were completed and the
    dividends paid. Collins preached in the park every Sunday. But this has nothing
    to do with the story.</p>
  <p>When Arvie came out it was beginning to rain and the hands had all gone
    except Bill, who stood with his back to a verandah-post, spitting with very
    fair success at the ragged toe of one boot. He looked up, nodded carelessly
    at Arvie, and then made a dive for a passing lorry, on the end of which he
    disappeared round the next corner, unsuspected by the driver, who sat in
    front with his pipe in his mouth and a bag over his shoulders.</p>
  <p>Arvie started home with his heart and mind pretty full, and a stronger,
    stranger aversion to ever going back to the shop again. This new, unexpected,
    and unsought-for friendship embarrassed the poor lonely child. It wasn&rsquo;t
    welcome.</p>
  <p>But he never went back. He got wet going home, and that night he was a dying
    child. He had been ill all the time, and Collins was one &ldquo;baby&rdquo;  short
    next day.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSelectorsDaughter"></a>The Selector&rsquo;s
      Daughter</b></h2>
  <h3 align="center"><b>I.</b></h3>
  <p>She rode slowly down the steep siding from the main road to a track in the
    bed of the Long Gully, the old grey horse picking his way zig-zag fashion.
    She was about seventeen, slight in figure, and had a pretty freckled face
    with a pathetically drooping mouth, and big sad brown eyes. She wore a faded
    print dress, with an old black riding skirt drawn over it, and her head was
    hidden in one of those ugly, old-fashioned white hoods, which, seen from
    the rear, always suggest an old woman. She carried several parcels of groceries
    strapped to the front of the dilapidated side-saddle.</p>
  <p>The track skirted a chain of rocky waterholes at the foot of the gully,
    and the girl glanced nervously at these ghastly, evil-looking pools as she
    passed them by. The sun had set, as far as Long Gully was concerned. The
    old horse carefully followed a rough bridle track, which ran up the gully
    now on one side of the watercourse and now on the other; the gully grew deeper
    and darker, and its sullen, scrub-covered sides rose more steeply as he progressed.</p>
  <p>The girl glanced round frequently, as though afraid of someone following
    her. Once she drew rein, and listened to some bush sound.  &ldquo;Kangaroos,&rdquo; she
    murmured; it was only kangaroos. She crossed a dimmed little clearing where
    a farm had been, and entered a thick scrub of box and stringy-bark saplings.
    Suddenly with a heavy thud, thud, an &ldquo;old man&rdquo; kangaroo leapt
    the path in front, startling the girl fearfully, and went up the siding towards
    the peak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she gasped, with her hand on her heart.</p>
  <p>She was very nervous this evening; her heart was hurt now, and she held
    her hand close to it, while tears started from her eyes and glistened in
    the light of the moon, which was rising over the gap ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, if I could only go away from the bush!&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
  <p>The old horse plodded on, and now and then shook his head&mdash;sadly, it
    seemed&mdash;as if he knew her troubles and was sorry.</p>
  <p>She passed another clearing, and presently came to a small homestead in
    a stringy-bark hollow below a great gap in the ridges&mdash;&ldquo;Deadman&rsquo;s
    Gap&rdquo;. The place was called &ldquo;Deadman&rsquo;s Hollow&rdquo;, and
    looked like it. The  &ldquo;house&rdquo;&mdash;a low, two-roomed affair,
    with skillions&mdash;was built of half-round slabs and stringy-bark, and
    was nearly all roof; the bark, being darkened from recent rain, gave it a
    drearier appearance than usual.</p>
  <p>A big, coarse-looking youth of about twenty was nailing a green kangaroo
    skin to the slabs; he was out of temper because he had bruised his thumb.
    The girl unstrapped the parcels and carried them in; as she passed her brother,
    she said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take the saddle off for me, will you, Jack?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, carnt yer take it off yerself?&rdquo; he snarled; &ldquo;carnt
    yer see I&rsquo;m busy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She took off the saddle and bridle, and carried them into a shed, where
    she hung them on a beam. The patient old hack shook himself with an energy
    that seemed ill-advised, considering his age and condition, and went off
    towards the &ldquo;dam&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>An old woman sat in the main room beside a fireplace which took up almost
    the entire end of the house. A plank-table, supported on stakes driven into
    the ground, stood in the middle of the room, and two slab benches were fixtures
    on each side. The floor was clay. All was clean and poverty-stricken; all
    that could be whitewashed was white, and everything that could be washed
    was scrubbed. The slab shelves were covered with clean newspapers, on which
    bright tins, and pannikins, and fragments of crockery were set to the greatest
    advantage. The walls, however, were disfigured by Christmas supplements of
    illustrated journals.</p>
  <p>The girl came in and sat down wearily on a stool opposite to the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you any better, mother?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very little, Mary, very little. Have you seen your father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where he is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You might wonder. What&rsquo;s the use of worrying about it, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s drinking again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most likely. Worrying yourself to death won&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman sat and moaned about her troubles, as old women do. She had
    plenty to moan about.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where your brother Tom is? We haven&rsquo;t heard from him
    for a year now. He must be in trouble again; something tells me he must be
    in trouble again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary swung her hood off into her lap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you worry about it, mother? What&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I only wish I knew. I only wish I knew!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What good would that do? You know Tom went droving with Fred Dunn,
    and Fred will look after him; and, besides, Tom&rsquo;s older now and got
    more sense.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t care&mdash;you don&rsquo;t care! You don&rsquo;t
    feel it, but I&rsquo;m his mother, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, for God&rsquo;s sake, don&rsquo;t start that again, mother; it
    hurts me more than you think. I&rsquo;m his sister; I&rsquo;ve suffered enough,
    God knows! Don&rsquo;t make matters worse than they are!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here comes father!&rdquo; shouted one of the children outside, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    bringing home a steer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman sat still, and clasped her hands nervously. Mary tried to
    look cheerful, and moved the saucepan on the fire. A big, dark-bearded man,
    mounted on a small horse, was seen in the twilight driving a steer towards
    the cow-yard. A boy ran to let down the slip-rails.</p>
  <p>Presently Mary and her mother heard the clatter of rails let down and put
    up again, and a minute later a heavy step like the tread of a horse was heard
    outside. The selector lumbered in, threw his hat in a corner, and sat down
    by the table. His wife rose and bustled round with simulated cheerfulness.
    Presently Mary hazarded&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where have you been, father?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Somewheers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a wretched silence, lasting until the old woman took courage to
    say timidly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve brought a steer, Wylie?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; he snapped; the tone seemed defiant.</p>
  <p>The old woman&rsquo;s hands trembled, so that she dropped a cup. Mary turned
    a shade paler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, git me some tea. Git me some <i>tea</i>!&rdquo; shouted Mr.
    Wylie. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to sit here all night!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His wife made what haste her nervousness would allow, and they soon sat
    down to tea. Jack, the eldest son, was sulky, and his father muttered something
    about knocking the sulks out of him with an axe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s annoyed you, Jack?&rdquo; asked his mother, humbly.</p>
  <p>He scowled and made no answer.</p>
  <p>The younger children&mdash;three boys and a girl&mdash;began quarrelling
    as soon as they sat down. Wylie yelled at them now and then, and grumbled
    at the cooking, and at his wife for not being able to keep the children quiet.
    It was:  &ldquo;Marther! you didn&rsquo;t put no sugar in my tea.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother,
    Jimmy&rsquo;s got my place; make him move.&rdquo; &ldquo;Mawther! do speak
    to this Fred.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh! father, this big brute of a Harry&rsquo;s
    kickin&rsquo; me!&rdquo; And so on.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
  <p>When the miserable meal was over, Wylie got a rope and a butcher&rsquo;s
    knife, and went out to slaughter the steer; but first there was a row, because
    he thought&mdash;or pretended to think&mdash;that somebody had been using
    his knife. He lassoed the beast, drew it up to the rails, and slaughtered
    it.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, Jack and his next brother took an old gun, let the dogs loose,
    and went &rsquo;possum shooting.</p>
  <p>Presently Wylie came in again, sat down by the fire, and smoked. The children
    quarrelled over a boy&rsquo;s book; Mrs. Wylie made weak attempts to keep
    the peace, but they took no notice of her. Suddenly her husband rose with
    an oath, seized the novel, and threw it behind the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Git to bed! git to bed!&rdquo; he roared at the children; &ldquo;git
    to bed, or I&rsquo;ll smash your brains with the axe!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They got to bed. It was made of saplings and bark, covered with three bushel-bags
    full of straw and old pieces of blanket sewn together. The children quarrelled
    in bed till their father took off his belt and &ldquo;went into&rdquo;  them,
    according to promise. There was a sudden hush, followed by a sound like a
    bird-clapper; then howls; then a peaceful calm fell upon that happy home.</p>
  <p>Wylie went out again, and was absent an hour; on his return he sat by the
    fire and smoked sullenly. After a while he snatched the pipe from his mouth,
    and looked impatiently at the old woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake, git to bed,&rdquo; he snapped, &ldquo;and
    don&rsquo;t be asittin&rsquo; there like a blarsted funeral! You&rsquo;re
    enough to give a man the dismals.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Wylie gathered up her sewing and retired. Then he said to his daughter: &ldquo;You
    come and hold the candle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary put on her hood and followed her father to the yard. The carcase lay
    close to the rails, against which two sheets of bark had been raised as a
    break-wind. The beast had been partly skinned, and a portion of the hide,
    where a brand might have been, was carefully turned back. Mary noticed this
    at once. Her father went on with his work, and occasionally grumbled at her
    for not holding the candle right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where did you buy the steer, father?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask no questions and hear no lies.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;Carn&rsquo;t
    you see it&rsquo;s a clear skin?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She had a keen sense of humour, and the idea of a &ldquo;&lsquo;clear skin&rsquo;  steer&rdquo; would
    have amused her at any other time. She didn&rsquo;t smile now.</p>
  <p>He turned the carcase over; the loose hide fell back, and the light shone
    on a distinct brand. White as a sheet went Mary&rsquo;s face, and her hand
    trembled so that she nearly let the candle fall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What are you adoin&rsquo; of now?&rdquo; shouted her father. &ldquo;Hold
    the candle, carn&rsquo;t you? You&rsquo;re worse than the old woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father! the beast is branded! See!&mdash; What does PB stand for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Beggar, like myself. Hold the candle, carn&rsquo;t you?&mdash;and
    hold your tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary was startled again by hearing the tread of a horse, but it was only
    the old grey munching round. Her father finished skinning, and drew the carcase
    up to a make-shift &ldquo;gallows&rdquo;. &ldquo;Now you can go to bed,&rdquo; he
    said, in a gentler tone.</p>
  <p>She went to her bedroom&mdash;a small, low, slab skillion, built on to the
    end of the house&mdash;and fell on her knees by the bunk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God help me! God help us all!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
  <p>She lay down, but could not sleep. She was nervously ill&mdash;nearly mad,
    because of the dark, disgraceful cloud of trouble which hung over her home.
    Always in trouble&mdash;always in trouble. It started long ago, when her
    favourite brother Tom ran away. She was little more than a child then, intensely
    sensitive; and when she sat in the old bark school she fancied that the other
    children were thinking or whispering to each other, &ldquo;Her brother&rsquo;s
    in prison! Mary Wylie&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s in prison! Tom Wylie&rsquo;s
    in gaol!&rdquo; She was thinking of it still. They were ever with her, those
    horrible days and nights of the first shadow of shame. She had the same horror
    of evil, the same fearful dread of disgrace that her mother had. She had
    been ambitious; she had managed to read much, and had wild dreams of going
    to the city and rising above the common level, but that was all past now.</p>
  <p>How could she rise when the cruel hand of disgrace was ever ready to drag
    her down at any moment. &ldquo;Ah, God!&rdquo; she moaned in her misery, &ldquo;if
    we could only be born without kin&mdash;with no one to disgrace us but ourselves!
    It&rsquo;s cruel, God, it&rsquo;s cruel to suffer for the crimes of others!&rdquo; She
    was getting selfish in her troubles&mdash;like her mother. &ldquo;I want
    to go away from the bush and all I know.... O God, help me to go away from
    the bush!&rdquo; Presently she fell asleep&mdash;if sleep it may be called&mdash;and
    dreamt of sailing away, sailing away far out on the sea beyond the horizon
    of her dread. Then came a horrible nightmare, in which she and all her family
    were arrested for a terrible crime. She woke in a fright, and saw a reddish
    glare on the window. Her father was poking round some logs where they had
    been &ldquo;burning-off&rdquo;. A pungent odour came through a broken pane
    and turned her sick. He was burning the hide.</p>
  <p>Wylie did not go to bed that night; he got his breakfast before daylight,
    and rode up through the frosty gap while the stars were still out, carrying
    a bag of beef in front of him on the grey horse. Mary said nothing about
    the previous night. Her mother wondered how much &ldquo;father&rdquo; had
    given for the steer, and supposed he had gone into town to sell the hide;
    the poor soul tried to believe that he had come by the steer honestly. Mary
    fried some meat, and tried to eat it for her mother&rsquo;s sake, but could
    manage only a few mouthfuls. Mrs. Wylie also seemed to have lost her appetite.
    Jack and his brother, who had been out all night, made a hearty breakfast.
    Then Jimmy started to peg out the &rsquo;possum skins, while Jack went to
    look for a missing pony. Mary was left to milk all the cows, and feed the
    calves and pigs.</p>
  <p>Shortly after dinner one of the children ran to the door, and cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, mother&mdash;here&rsquo;s three mounted troopers comin&rsquo; up
    the gully!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried the mother, sinking back in her chair and
    trembling like a leaf. The children ran and hid in the scrub. Mary stood
    up, terribly calm, and waited. The eldest trooper dismounted, came to the
    door, glanced suspiciously at the remains of the meal, and abruptly asked
    the dreaded question:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wylie, where&rsquo;s your husband?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She dropped the tea-cup, from which she had pretended to be drinking unconcernedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? Why, what do you want my husband for?&rdquo; she asked in pitiful
    desperation. <i>She</i> looked like the guilty party.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, you know well enough,&rdquo; he sneered impatiently.</p>
  <p>Mary rose and faced him. &ldquo;How dare you talk to my mother like that?&rdquo; she
    cried. &ldquo;If my poor brother Tom was only here&mdash;you&mdash;you coward!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The youngest trooper whispered something to his senior, and then, stung
    by a sharp retort, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be a pig.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His two companions passed through into the spare skillion, where they found
    some beef in a cask, and more already salted down under a bag on the end
    of a bench; then they went out at the back and had a look at the cow-yard.
    The younger trooper lingered behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and get them up the gully on some excuse,&rdquo; he
    whispered to Mary. &ldquo;You plant the hide before we come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late. Look there!&rdquo; She pointed through the doorway.</p>
  <p>The other two were at the logs where the fire had been; the burning hide
    had stuck to the logs in places like glue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wylie&rsquo;s a fool,&rdquo; remarked the old trooper.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>III</b><i>.</i></p>
  <p>Jack disappeared shortly after his father&rsquo;s arrest on a charge of
    horse and cattle-stealing, and Tom, the prodigal, turned up unexpectedly.
    He was different from his father and eldest brother. He had an open good-humoured
    face, and was very kind-hearted; but was subject to peculiar fits of insanity,
    during which he did wild and foolish things for the mere love of notoriety.
    He had two natures&mdash;one bright and good, the other sullen and criminal.
    A taint of madness ran in the family&mdash;came down from drunken and unprincipled
    fathers of dead generations; under different conditions, it might have developed
    into genius in one or two&mdash;in Mary, perhaps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old woman!&rdquo; cried Tom, patting his mother on the
    back.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be happy yet. I&rsquo;ve been wild and foolish,
    I know, and gave you some awful trouble, but that&rsquo;s all done with.
    I mean to keep steady, and by-and-bye we&rsquo;ll go away to Sydney or Queensland.
    Give us a smile, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He got some &ldquo;grubbing&rdquo; to do, and for six months kept the family
    in provisions. Then a change came over him. He became moody and sullen&mdash;even
    brutal. He would sit for hours and grin to himself without any apparent cause;
    then he would stay away from home for days together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom&rsquo;s going wrong again,&rdquo; wailed Mrs. Wylie. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
    get into trouble again, I know he will. We are disgraced enough already,
    God knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done your best, mother,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;and
    can do no more. People will pity us; after all, the thing itself is not so
    bad as the everlasting dread of it. This will be a lesson for father&mdash;he
    wanted one&mdash;and maybe he&rsquo;ll be a better man.&rdquo; (She knew
    better than that.) &ldquo;<i>You</i> did your best, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, Mary! you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve gone through these
    thirty years in the bush with your father. I&rsquo;ve had to go down on my
    knees and beg people not to prosecute him&mdash;and the same with your brother
    Tom; and this is the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better to have let them go, mother; you should have left father when
    you found out what sort of a man he was; it would have been better for all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was my duty to stick by him, child; he was my husband. Your father
    was always a bad man, Mary&mdash;a bad man; I found it out too late. I could
    not tell you a quarter of what I have suffered with him.... I was proud,
    Mary; I wanted my children to be better than others.... It&rsquo;s my fault;
    it&rsquo;s a judgment.... I wanted to make my children better than others....
    I was so proud, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary had a sweetheart, a drover, who was supposed to be in Queensland. He
    had promised to marry her, and take her and her mother away when he returned;
    at least, she had promised to marry him on that condition. He had now been
    absent on his latest trip for nearly six months, and there was no news from
    him. She got a copy of a country paper to look for the &ldquo;stock passings&rdquo;;
    but a startling headline caught her eye:</p>
  <p align="center" class="newspaper">IMPUDENT ATTEMPT AT ROBBERY UNDER ARMS</p>
  <p class="newspaper">&ldquo;A drover known to the police as Frederick Dunn,
    alias Drew, was arrested last week at&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She read to the bitter end, and burned the paper. And the shadow of another
    trouble, darker and drearier than all the rest, was upon her.</p>
  <p>So the little outcast family in Long Gully existed for several months, seeing
    no one save a sympathetic old splitter who would come and smoke his pipe
    by the fire of nights, and try to convince the old woman that matters might
    have been worse, and that she wouldn&rsquo;t worry so much if she knew the
    troubles of some of our biggest families, and that things would come out
    all right and the lesson would do Wylie good. Also, that Tom was a different
    boy altogether, and had more sense than to go wrong again. &ldquo;It was
    nothing,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;nothing; they didn&rsquo;t know what trouble
    was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But one day, when Mary and her mother were alone, the troopers came again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs. Wylie, where&rsquo;s your son Tom?&rdquo; they asked.</p>
  <p>She sat still. She didn&rsquo;t even cry, &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Mrs. Wylie,&rdquo; said one of the troopers,
    gently. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t for much anyway, and maybe Tom&rsquo;ll be
    able to clear himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary sank on her knees by her mother&rsquo;s side, crying &ldquo;Speak to
    me, mother. Oh, my God, she&rsquo;s dying! Speak for my sake, mother. Don&rsquo;t
    die, mother; it&rsquo;s all a mistake. Don&rsquo;t die and leave me here
    alone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the poor old woman was dead.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>Wylie came out towards the end of the year, and a few weeks later he brought
    home a&mdash;another woman.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>IV</b> </h3>
  <p>Bob Bentley, general hawker, was camping under some rocks by the main road,
    near the foot of Long Gully. His mate was fast asleep under the tilted trap.
    Bob stood with his back to the fire, his pipe in his mouth, and his hands
    clasped behind him. The fire lit up the undersides of the branches above;
    a native bear sat in a fork blinking down at it, while the moon above him
    showed every hair on his ears. From among the trees came the pleasant jingle
    of hobble-chains, the slow tread of hoofs, and the &ldquo;crunch, crunch&rdquo; at
    the grass, as the horses moved about and grazed, now in moonlight, now in
    the soft shadows. &ldquo;Old Thunder&rdquo;, a big black dog of no particular
    breed, gave a meaning look at his master, and started up the ridge, followed
    by several smaller dogs. Soon Bob heard from the hillside the &ldquo;hy-yi-hi,
    whomp, whomp, whomp!&rdquo; of old Thunder, and the yop-yop-yopping of the
    smaller fry&mdash;they had tree&rsquo;d a &rsquo;possum. Bob threw himself
    on the grass, and pretended to be asleep. There was a sound as of a sizeable
    boulder rolling down the hill, and presently Thunder trotted round the fire
    to see if his master would come. Bob snored. The dog looked suspiciously
    at him, trotted round once or twice, and as a last resource gave him two
    great slobbery licks across the face. Bob got up with a good-natured oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, old party,&rdquo; he said to Thunder, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a
    thundering old nuisance; but I s&rsquo;pose you won&rsquo;t be satisfied
    till I come.&rdquo; He got a gun from the waggonette, loaded it, and started
    up the ridge; old Thunder rushing to and fro to show the way&mdash;as if
    the row the other dogs were making wasn&rsquo;t enough to guide his master.</p>
  <p>When Bob returned with the &rsquo;possums he was startled to see a woman
    in the camp. She was sitting on a log by the fire, with her elbows on her
    knees and her face in her hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;what the dev&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl raised a white desperate face to him. It was Mary Wylie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My father and&mdash;and the woman&mdash;they&rsquo;re drinking&mdash;they
    turned me out! they turned me out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they now? I&rsquo;m sorry for that. What can I do for you?...
    She&rsquo;s mad sure enough,&rdquo; he thought to himself; &ldquo;I thought
    it was a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.
    You&rsquo;re a man, and I&rsquo;m a helpless girl. They turned me out! My
    mother&rsquo;s dead, and my brothers gone away. Look! Look here!&rdquo; pointing
    to a bruise on her forehead. &ldquo;The woman did that. My own father stood
    by and saw it done&mdash;said it served me right! Oh, my God!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What woman? Tell me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The woman father brought home!... I want to go away from the bush!
    Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake take me away from the bush!... Anything! anything!&mdash;you
    know!&mdash;only take me away from the bush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bob and his mate&mdash;who had been roused&mdash;did their best to soothe
    her; but suddenly, without a moment&rsquo;s warning, she sprang to her feet
    and scrambled to the top of the rock overhanging the camp. She stood for
    a moment in the bright moonlight, gazing intently down the vacant road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; she cried, pointing down the road. &ldquo;Here
    they come&mdash;the troopers! I can see their cap-peaks glistening in the
    moonlight!... I&rsquo;m going away! Mother&rsquo;s gone. I&rsquo;m going
    now!&mdash;Good-bye!&mdash;Good-bye! I&rsquo;m going away from the bush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she ran through the trees towards the foot of Long Gully. Bob and his
    mate followed; but, being unacquainted with the locality, they lost her.</p>
  <p>She ran to the edge of a granite cliff on the higher side of the deepest
    of the rocky waterholes. There was a heavy splash, and three startled kangaroos,
    who had been drinking, leapt back and sped away, like three grey ghosts,
    up the ridge towards the moonlit peak.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="MitchellontheSexandOtherProblems"></a>Mitchell
      on the &ldquo;Sex&rdquo; and Other &ldquo;Problems&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;I agree with &lsquo;T&rsquo; in last week&rsquo;s &lsquo;Bulletin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, after cogitating some time over the last drop of tea in his pannikin,
    held at various angles, &ldquo;about what they call the &lsquo;Sex Problem&rsquo;.
    There&rsquo;s no problem, really, except Creation, and that&rsquo;s not our
    affair; we can&rsquo;t solve it, and we&rsquo;ve no right to make a problem
    out of it for ourselves to puzzle over, and waste the little time that is
    given us about. It&rsquo;s we that make the problems, not Creation. We make &rsquo;em,
    and they only smother us; they&rsquo;ll smother the world in the end if we
    don&rsquo;t look out. Anything that can be argued, for and against, from
    half a dozen different points of view&mdash;and most things that men argue
    over can be&mdash;and anything that has been argued about for thousands of
    years (as most things have) is worse than profitless; it wastes the world&rsquo;s
    time and ours, and often wrecks old mateships. Seems to me the deeper you
    read, think, talk, or write about things that end in ism, the less satisfactory
    the result; the more likely you are to get bushed and dissatisfied with the
    world. And the more you keep on the surface of plain things, the plainer
    the sailing&mdash;the more comfortable for you and everybody else. We&rsquo;ve
    always got to come to the surface to breathe, in the end, in any case; we&rsquo;re
    meant to live on the surface, and we might as well stay there and look after
    it and ourselves for all the good we do diving down after fish that aren&rsquo;t
    there, except in our imagination. And some of &rsquo;em are very dead fish,
    too&mdash;the &lsquo;Sex Problem&rsquo;, for instance. When we fall off the
    surface of the earth it will be time enough to make a problem out of the
    fact that we couldn&rsquo;t stick on. I&rsquo;m a Federal Pro-trader in this
    country; I&rsquo;m a Federalist because I think Federation is the plain and
    natural course for Australia, and I&rsquo;m a Free-tectionist because I&rsquo;m
    in favour of sinking any question, or any two things, that enlightened people
    can argue and fight over, and try, one after the other, for fifty years without
    being able to come to a decision about, or prove which is best for the welfare
    of the country. It only wastes a young country&rsquo;s time, and keeps it
    off the right track. Federation isn&rsquo;t a problem&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
    plain fact&mdash;but they make a problem out of every panel they have to
    push down in the rotten old boundary fences.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Personal interests,&rdquo; suggested Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course. It&rsquo;s personal interest of the wrong sort that makes
    all the problems. You can trace the sex problem to people who trade in unhealthy
    personal interests. I believe in personal interests of the right sort&mdash;true
    individualism. If we all looked after ourselves, and our wives and families&mdash;if
    we have any&mdash;in the proper way, the world would be all right. We waste
    too much time looking after each other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, supposing we&rsquo;re travelling and have to get a shed and
    make a cheque so&rsquo;s to be able to send a few quid home, as soon as we
    can, to the missus, or the old folks, and the next water is twenty miles
    ahead. If we sat down and argued over a social problem till doomsday, we
    wouldn&rsquo;t get to the tank; we&rsquo;d die of thirst, and the missus
    and kids, or the old folks, would be sold up and turned out into the streets,
    and have to fall back on a &lsquo;home of hope&rsquo;, or wait their turn
    at the Benevolent Asylum with bags for broken victuals. I&rsquo;ve seen that,
    and I don&rsquo;t want anybody belonging to me to have to do it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me that when a poor, deserted girl goes to a &lsquo;home&rsquo; they
    don&rsquo;t make a problem of her&mdash;they do their best for her and try
    to get her righted. And the priests, too: if there&rsquo;s anything in the
    sex or any other problem&mdash;anything that hasn&rsquo;t been threshed out&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    the men that&rsquo;ll know it. I&rsquo;m not a Catholic, but I know this:
    that if a girl that&rsquo;s been left by one&mdash;no matter what Church
    she belongs to&mdash;goes to the priest, they&rsquo;ll work all the points
    they know (and they know &rsquo;em all) to get her righted, and, if the chap,
    or his people, won&rsquo;t come up to the scratch, Father Ryan&rsquo;ll frighten
    hell out of &rsquo;em. I can&rsquo;t say as much for our own Churches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re in favour of socialism and democracy?&rdquo; asked
    Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course I am. But the world won&rsquo;t do any good arguing over
    it. The people will have to get up and walk, and, what&rsquo;s more, stick
    together&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ll ever do that&mdash;it
    ain&rsquo;t in human nature. Socialism, or democracy, was all right in this
    country till it got fashionable and was made a fad or a problem of. Then
    it got smothered pretty quick. And a fad or a problem always breeds a host
    of parasites or hangers-on. Why, as soon as I saw the advanced idealist fools&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    generally the middle-class, shabby-genteel families that catch Spiritualism
    and Theosophy and those sort of complaints, at the end of the epidemic&mdash;that
    catch on at the tail-end of things and think they&rsquo;ve caught something
    brand, shining, new;&mdash;as soon as I saw them, and the problem spielers
    and notoriety-hunters of both sexes, beginning to hang round Australian Unionism,
    I knew it was doomed. And so it was. The straight men were disgusted, or
    driven out. There are women who hang on for the same reason that a girl will
    sometimes go into the dock and swear an innocent man&rsquo;s life away. But
    as soon as they see that the cause is dying, they drop it at once, and wait
    for another. They come like bloody dingoes round a calf, and only leave the
    bones. They&rsquo;re about as democratic as the crows. And the rotten &lsquo;sex-problem&rsquo;  sort
    of thing is the cause of it all; it poisons weak minds&mdash;and strong ones
    too sometimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, you could make a problem out of Epsom salts. You might argue
    as to why human beings want Epsom salts, and try to trace the causes that
    led up to it. I don&rsquo;t like the taste of Epsom salts&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    nasty in the mouth&mdash;but when I feel that way I take &rsquo;em, and I
    feel better afterwards; and that&rsquo;s good enough for me. We might argue
    that black is white, and white is black, and neither of &rsquo;em is anything,
    and nothing is everything; and a woman&rsquo;s a man and a man&rsquo;s a
    woman, and it&rsquo;s really the man that has the youngsters, only we imagine
    it&rsquo;s the woman because she imagines that she has all the pain and trouble,
    and the doctor is under the impression that he&rsquo;s attending to her,
    not the man, and the man thinks so too because he imagines he&rsquo;s walking
    up and down outside, and slipping into the corner pub now and then for a
    nip to keep his courage up, waiting, when it&rsquo;s his wife that&rsquo;s
    doing that all the time; we might argue that it&rsquo;s all force of imagination,
    and that imagination is an unknown force, and that the unknown is nothing.
    But, when we&rsquo;ve settled all that to our own satisfaction, how much
    further ahead are we? In the end we&rsquo;ll come to the conclusion that
    we ain&rsquo;t alive, and never existed, and then we&rsquo;ll leave off bothering,
    and the world will go on just the same.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What about science?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Science ain&rsquo;t &lsquo;sex problems&rsquo;; it&rsquo;s facts....
    Now, I don&rsquo;t mind Spiritualism and those sort of things; they might
    help to break the monotony, and can&rsquo;t do much harm. But the &lsquo;sex
    problem&rsquo;, as it&rsquo;s written about to-day, does; it&rsquo;s dangerous
    and dirty, and it&rsquo;s time to settle it with a club. Science and education,
    if left alone, will look after sex facts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get anything out of the &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo;,
    no matter how you argue. In the old Bible times they had half a dozen wives
    each, but we don&rsquo;t know for certain how <i>they</i> got on. The Mormons
    tried it again, and seemed to get on all right till we interfered. We don&rsquo;t
    seem to be able to get on with one wife now&mdash;at least, according to
    the &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo;. The &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo; troubled the
    Turks so much that they tried three. Lots of us try to settle it by knocking
    round promiscuously, and that leads to actions for maintenance and breach
    of promise cases, and all sorts of trouble. Our blacks settle the &lsquo;sex
    problem&rsquo; with a club, and so far I haven&rsquo;t heard any complaints
    from them.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take hereditary causes and surrounding circumstances, for instance.
    In order to understand or judge a man right, you would need to live under
    the same roof with him from childhood, and under the same roofs, or tents,
    with his parents, right back to Adam, and then you&rsquo;d be blocked for
    want of more ancestors through which to trace the causes that led to Abel&mdash;I
    mean Cain&mdash;going on as he did. What&rsquo;s the use or sense of it?
    You might argue away in any direction for a million miles and a million years
    back into the past, but you&rsquo;ve got to come back to where you are if
    you wish to do any good for yourself, or anyone else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes it takes you a long while to get back to where you are&mdash;sometimes
    you never do it. Why, when those controversies were started in the &lsquo;Bulletin&rsquo; about
    the kangaroos and other things, I thought I knew something about the bush.
    Now I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;m sure I could tell a kangaroo from a wombat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Trying to find out things is the cause of all the work and trouble
    in this world. It was Eve&rsquo;s fault in the first place&mdash;or Adam&rsquo;s,
    rather, because it might be argued that he should have been master. Some
    men are too lazy to be masters in their own homes, and run the show properly;
    some are too careless, and some too drunk most of their time, and some too
    weak. If Adam and Eve hadn&rsquo;t tried to find out things there&rsquo;d
    have been no toil and trouble in the world to-day; there&rsquo;d have been
    no bloated capitalists, and no horny-handed working men, and no politics,
    no freetrade and protection&mdash;and no clothes. The woman next door wouldn&rsquo;t
    be able to pick holes in your wife&rsquo;s washing on the line. We&rsquo;d
    have been all running about in a big Garden of Eden with nothing on, and
    nothing to do except loaf, and make love, and lark, and laugh, and play practical
    jokes on each other.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe grinned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would have been glorious. Wouldn&rsquo;t it, Joe? There&rsquo;d
    have been no &lsquo;sex problem&rsquo; then.&rdquo;</p>

    with Johnny Nowlett, and he&rsquo;s going to give me a fire out of his gun.
    You can come, too. I don&rsquo;t want to cop out on it to-night&mdash;if
    I do I&rsquo;ll run away from home again, so there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bill walked on a bit in moody, Joe in troubled, silence.</p>
  <p>Bill tried again: he threatened, argued, and pleaded, but Joe was firm. &ldquo;The
    master trusted me, Will,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said Bill at last, after a long pause, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
    do it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe was troubled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it to you, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe thought how Bill had stood up and fought for him only last week.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d tear the note in bits; I&rsquo;d tell a hundred lies; I&rsquo;d
    take a dozen hidings first, Joe&mdash;I would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe was greatly troubled. His chest heaved, and the tears came to his eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d do more than that for you, Joe, and you know it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe knew it. They were crossing the old goldfield now. There was a shaft
    close to the path; it had fallen in, funnel-shaped, at the top, but was still
    thirty or forty feet deep; some old logs were jammed across about five feet
    down. Joe suddenly snatched the note from his pocket and threw it in. It
    fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece of the old timber. Bill
    saw it, but said nothing, and, seeing their father coming home from work,
    they hurried on.</p>
  <p>Joe was deep in trouble now. Bill tried to comfort and cheer him, but it
    was no use. Bill promised never to run away from home any more, to go to
    school every day, and never to fight, or steal, or tell lies. But Joe had
    betrayed his trust for the first time in his life, and wouldn&rsquo;t be
    comforted.</p>
  <p>Some time in the night Bill woke, and found Joe sitting up in bed crying.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never done a mean thing like that before,&rdquo; sobbed Joe. &ldquo;I
    wished I&rsquo;d chucked meself down the shaft instead. The master trusted
    me, Will; an&rsquo; now, if he asks me to-morrow, I&rsquo;ll have to tell
    a lie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then tell the truth, Joe, an&rsquo; take the hidin&rsquo;; it&rsquo;ll
    soon be over&mdash;just a couple of cuts with the cane and it&rsquo;ll be
    all over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, no, it won&rsquo;t. He won&rsquo;t never trust me any more. I&rsquo;ve
    never been caned in that school yet, Will, and if I am I&rsquo;ll never go
    again. Oh! why will you run away from home, Will, and play the wag, and steal,
    and get us all into such trouble? You don&rsquo;t know how mother takes on
    about it&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know how it hurts father! I&rsquo;ve deceived
    the master, and mother and father to-day, just because you&rsquo;re so&mdash;so
    selfish,&rdquo; and he laid down and cried himself to sleep.</p>
  <p>Bill lay awake and thought till daylight; then he got up quietly, put on
    his clothes, and stole away from the house and across the flat, followed
    by the dog, who thought it was a &rsquo;possum-hunting expedition. Bill wished
    the dog would not be quite so demonstrative, at least until they got away
    from the house. He went straight to the shaft, let himself down carefully
    on to one of the old logs, and stooped to pick up the note, gleaming white
    in the sickly summer daylight. Then the rotten timber gave way suddenly,
    without a moment&rsquo;s warning.</p>
  <p align="center"><i>* * * * * * * * *</i> </p>
  <p>They found him that morning at about nine o&rsquo;clock. The dog attracted
    the attention of an old fossicker passing to his work. The letter was gripped
    in Bill&rsquo;s right hand when they brought him up. They took him home,
    and the father went for a doctor. Bill came to himself a little just before
    the last, and said: &ldquo;Mother! I wasn&rsquo;t running away, mother&mdash;tell
    father that&mdash;I&mdash;I wanted to try and catch a &rsquo;possum on the
    ground.... Where&rsquo;s Joe? I want Joe. Go out, mother, a minute, and send
    Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here I am, Bill,&rdquo; said Joe, in a choking, terrified voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has the master been yet?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bend down, Joe. I went for the note, and the logs gave way. I meant
    to be back before they was up. I dropped it down inside the bed; you watch
    your chance and get it; and say you forgot it last night&mdash;say you didn&rsquo;t
    like to give it&mdash;that won&rsquo;t be a lie. Tell the master I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    sorry&mdash;tell the master never to send no notes no more&mdash;except by
    girls&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.... Mother! Take the blankets off me&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    dyin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryoftheOracle"></a>The Story of the Oracle</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;We young fellows,&rdquo; said &ldquo;Sympathy Joe&rdquo; to Mitchell,
    after tea, in their first camp west the river&mdash;&ldquo;and you and I <i>are</i> young
    fellows, comparatively&mdash;think we know the world. There are plenty of
    young chaps knocking round in this country who reckon they&rsquo;ve been
    through it all before they&rsquo;re thirty. I&rsquo;ve met cynics and men-o&rsquo;-the-world,
    aged twenty-one or thereabouts, who&rsquo;ve never been further than a trip
    to Sydney. They talk about &lsquo;this world&rsquo; as if they&rsquo;d knocked
    around in half-a-dozen other worlds before they came across here&mdash;and
    they are just as off-hand about it as older Australians are when they talk
    about this colony as compared with the others. They say: &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;same
    here.&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been there.&rsquo; &lsquo;My oath!&mdash;you&rsquo;re
    right.&rsquo; &lsquo;Take it from me!&rsquo; and all that sort of thing.
    They understand women, and have a contempt for &rsquo;em; and chaps that
    don&rsquo;t talk as they talk, or do as they do, or see as they see, are
    either soft or ratty. A good many reckon that &lsquo;life ain&rsquo;t blanky
    well worth livin&rsquo;&rsquo;; sometimes they feel so blanky somehow that
    they wouldn&rsquo;t give a blank whether they chucked it or not; but that
    sort never chuck it. It&rsquo;s mostly the quiet men that do that, and if
    they&rsquo;ve got any complaints to make against the world they make &rsquo;em
    at the head station. Why, I&rsquo;ve known healthy, single, young fellows
    under twenty-five who drank to drown their troubles&mdash;some because they
    reckoned the world didn&rsquo;t understand nor appreciate &rsquo;em&mdash;as
    if it <i>could</i>!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If the world don&rsquo;t understand or appreciate you,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell solemnly, as he reached for a burning stick to light his pipe&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Make</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To drown <i>their</i> troubles!&rdquo; continued Joe, in a tone of
    impatient contempt. &ldquo;The Oracle must be well on towards the sixties;
    he can take his glass with any man, but you never saw him drunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Oracle to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear his history?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. Do you know it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, though I don&rsquo;t think he has any idea that I do. Now, we
    were talking about the Oracle a little while ago. We know he&rsquo;s an old
    ass; a good many outsiders consider that he&rsquo;s a bit soft or ratty,
    and, as we&rsquo;re likely to be mates together for some time on that fencing
    contract, if we get it, you might as well know what sort of a man he is and
    was, so&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t get uneasy about him if he gets deaf for
    a while when you&rsquo;re talking, or does funny things with his pipe or
    pint-pot, or walks up and down by himself for an hour or so after tea, or
    sits on a log with his head in his hands, or leans on the fence in the gloaming
    and keeps looking in a blank sort of way, straight ahead, across the clearing.
    For he&rsquo;s gazing at something a thousand miles across country, south-east,
    and about twenty years back into the past, and no doubt he sees himself (as
    a young man), and a Gippsland girl, spooning under the stars along between
    the hop-gardens and the Mitchell River. And, if you get holt of a fiddle
    or a concertina, don&rsquo;t rasp or swank too much on old tunes, when he&rsquo;s
    round, for the Oracle can&rsquo;t stand it. Play something lively. He&rsquo;ll
    be down there at that surveyor&rsquo;s camp yarning till all hours, so we&rsquo;ll
    have plenty of time for the story&mdash;but don&rsquo;t you ever give him
    a hint that you know.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My people knew him well; I got most of the story from them&mdash;mostly
    from Uncle Bob, who knew him better than any. The rest leaked out through
    the women&mdash;you know how things leak out amongst women?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell dropped his head and scratched the back of it. <i>He</i> knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was on the Cudgegong River. My Uncle Bob was mates with him on
    one of those &lsquo;rushes&rsquo; along there&mdash;the &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;,
    I think it was, or the &lsquo;Log Paddock&rsquo;. The Oracle was a young
    man then, of course, and so was Uncle Bob (he was a match for most men).
    You see the Oracle now, and you can imagine what he was when he was a young
    man. Over six feet, and as straight as a sapling, Uncle Bob said, clean-limbed,
    and as fresh as they made men in those days; carried his hands behind him,
    as he does now, when he hasn&rsquo;t got the swag&mdash;but his shoulders
    were back in those days. Of course he wasn&rsquo;t the Oracle then; he was
    young Tom Marshall&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter. Everybody liked him&mdash;especially
    women and children. He was a bit happy-go-lucky and careless, but he didn&rsquo;t
    know anything about &lsquo;this world&rsquo;, and didn&rsquo;t bother about
    it; he hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;been there&rsquo;. &lsquo;And his heart was as
    good as gold,&rsquo; my aunt used to say. He didn&rsquo;t understand women
    as we young fellows do nowadays, and therefore he hadn&rsquo;t any contempt
    for &rsquo;em. Perhaps he understood, and understands, them better than any
    of us, without knowing it. Anyway, you know, he&rsquo;s always gentle and
    kind where a woman or child is concerned, and doesn&rsquo;t like to hear
    us talk about women as we do sometimes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was a girl on the goldfields&mdash;a fine lump of a blonde,
    and pretty gay. She came from Sydney, I think, with her people, who kept
    shanties on the fields. She had a splendid voice, and used to sing &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo;.
    There might have been one or two bad women before that, in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    world, but no cold-blooded, designing ones. He calls the bad ones &lsquo;unfortunate&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps it was Tom&rsquo;s looks, or his freshness, or his innocence,
    or softness&mdash;or all together&mdash;that attracted her. Anyway, he got
    mixed up with her before the goldfield petered out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt it took a long while for the facts to work into Tom&rsquo;s
    head that a girl might sing like she did and yet be thoroughly unprincipled.
    The Oracle was always slow at coming to a decision, but when he does it&rsquo;s
    generally the right one. Anyway, you can take that for granted, for you won&rsquo;t
    move him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether he found out that she wasn&rsquo;t all
    that she pretented to be to him, or whether they quarrelled, or whether she
    chucked him over for a lucky digger. Tom never had any luck on the goldfields.
    Anyway, he left and went over to the Victorian side, where his people were,
    and went up Gippsland way. It was there for the first time in his life that
    he got what you would call &lsquo;properly gone on a girl&rsquo;; he got
    hard hit&mdash;he met his fate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her name was Bertha Bredt, I remember. Aunt Bob saw her afterwards.
    Aunt Bob used to say that she was &lsquo;a girl as God made her&rsquo;&mdash;a
    good, true, womanly girl&mdash;one of those sort of girls that only love
    once. Tom got on with her father, who was packing horses through the ranges
    to the new goldfields&mdash;it was rough country and there were no roads;
    they had to pack everything there in those days, and there was money in it.
    The girl&rsquo;s father took to Tom&mdash;as almost everybody else did&mdash;and,
    as far as the girl was concerned, I think it was a case of love at first
    sight. They only knew each other for about six months, and were only &lsquo;courting&rsquo; (as
    they called it then) for three or four months altogether, but she was that
    sort of girl that can love a man for six weeks and lose him for ever, and
    yet go on loving him to the end of her life&mdash;and die with his name on
    her lips.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, things were brightening up every way for Tom, and he and his
    sweetheart were beginning to talk about their own little home in future,
    when there came a letter from the &lsquo;Madeline&rsquo; girl in New South
    Wales.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was in terrible trouble. Her baby was to be born in a month.
    Her people had kicked her out, and she was in danger of starving. She begged
    and prayed of him to come back and marry her, if only for his child&rsquo;s
    sake. He could go then, and be free; she would never trouble him any more&mdash;only
    come and marry her for the child&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle doesn&rsquo;t know where he lost that letter, but I do.
    It was burnt afterwards by a woman, who was more than a mother to him in
    his trouble&mdash;Aunt Bob. She thought he might carry it round with the
    rest of his papers, in his swag, for years, and come across it unexpectedly
    when he was camped by himself in the bush and feeling dull. It wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done him any good then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He must have fought the hardest fight in his life when he got that
    letter. No doubt he walked to and fro, to and fro, all night, with his hands
    behind him, and his eyes on the ground, as he does now sometimes. Walking
    up and down helps you to fight a thing out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No doubt he thought of things pretty well as he thinks now: the poor
    girl&rsquo;s shame on every tongue, and belled round the district by every
    hag in the township; and she looked upon by women as being as bad as any
    man who ever went to Bathurst in the old days, handcuffed between two troopers.
    There is sympathy, a pipe and tobacco, a cheering word, and, maybe, a whisky
    now and then, for the criminal on his journey; but there is no mercy, at
    least as far as women are concerned, for the poor foolish girl, who has to
    sneak out the back way and round by back streets and lanes after dark, with
    a cloak on to hide her figure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom sent what money he thought he could spare, and next day he went
    to the girl he loved and who loved him, and told her the truth, and showed
    her the letter. She was only a girl&mdash;but the sort of girl you <i>could</i> go
    to in a crisis like that. He had made up his mind to do the right thing,
    and she loved him all the more for it. And so they parted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When Tom reached &lsquo;Pipeclay&rsquo;, the girl&rsquo;s relations,
    that she was stopping with, had a parson readied up, and they were married
    the same day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened after that?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing happened for three or four months; then the child was born.
    It wasn&rsquo;t his!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell stood up with an oath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The girl was thoroughly bad. She&rsquo;d been carrying on with God
    knows how many men, both before and after she trapped Tom.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you know how the Oracle argues over things, and I suppose he
    was as big an old fool then as he is now. He thinks that, as most men would
    deceive women if they could, when one man gets caught, he&rsquo;s got no
    call to squeal about it; he&rsquo;s bound, because of the sins of men in
    general against women, to make the best of it. What is one man&rsquo;s wrong
    counted against the wrongs of hundreds of unfortunate girls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an uncommon way of arguing&mdash;like most of the Oracle&rsquo;s
    ideas&mdash;but it seems to look all right at first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps he thought she&rsquo;d go straight; perhaps she convinced
    him that he was the cause of her first fall; anyway he stuck to her for more
    than a year, and intended to take her away from that place as soon as he&rsquo;d
    scraped enough money together. It might have gone on up till now, if the
    father of the child&mdash;a big black Irishman named Redmond&mdash;hadn&rsquo;t
    come sneaking back at the end of a year. He&mdash;well, he came hanging round
    Mrs. Marshall while Tom was away at work&mdash;and she encouraged him. And
    Tom was forced to see it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom wanted to fight out his own battle without interference, but
    the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;they reckoned that he&rsquo;d stand
    very little show against Redmond, who was a very rough customer and a fighting
    man. My uncle Bob, who was there still, fixed it up this way: The Oracle
    was to fight Redmond, and if the Oracle got licked Uncle Bob was to take
    Redmond on. If Redmond whipped Uncle Bob, that was to settle it; but if Uncle
    Bob thrashed Redmond, then he was also to fight Redmond&rsquo;s mate, another
    big, rough Paddy named Duigan. Then the affair would be finished&mdash;no
    matter which way the last bout went. You see, Uncle Bob was reckoned more
    of a match for Redmond than the Oracle was, so the thing looked fair enough&mdash;at
    first sight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Redmond had his mate, Duigan, and one or two others of the rough
    gang that used to terrorise the fields round there in the roaring days of
    Gulgong. The Oracle had Uncle Bob, of course, and long Dave Regan, the drover&mdash;a
    good-hearted, sawny kind of chap that&rsquo;d break the devil&rsquo;s own
    buck-jumper, or smash him, or get smashed himself&mdash;and little Jimmy
    Nowlett, the bullocky, and one or two of the old, better-class diggers that
    were left on the field.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a clear space among the saplings in Specimen Gully,
    where they used to pitch circuses; and here, in the cool of a summer evening,
    the two men stood face to face. Redmond was a rough, roaring, foul-mouthed
    man; he stripped to his shirt, and roared like a bull, and swore, and sneered,
    and wanted to take the whole of Tom&rsquo;s crowd while he was at it, and
    make one clean job of &rsquo;em. Couldn&rsquo;t waste time fighting them
    all one after the other, because he wanted to get away to the new rush at
    Cattle Creek next day. The fool had been drinking shanty-whisky.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tom stood up in his clean, white moles and white flannel shirt&mdash;one
    of those sort with no sleeves, that give the arms play. He had a sort of
    set expression and a look in his eyes that Uncle Bob&mdash;nor none of them&mdash;had
    ever seen there before. &lsquo;Give us plenty of&mdash;room!&rsquo; roared
    Redmond; &lsquo;one of us is going to hell, now! This is going to be a fight
    to a&mdash;finish, and a&mdash;short one!&rsquo;  And it was!&rdquo; Joe
    paused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;go on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe drew a long breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle never got a mark! He was top-dog right from the start.
    Perhaps it was his strength that Redmond had underrated, or his want of science
    that puzzled him, or the awful silence of the man that frightened him (it
    made even Uncle Bob uneasy). Or, perhaps, it was Providence (it was a glorious
    chance for Providence), but, anyway, as I say, the Oracle never got a mark,
    except on his knuckles. After a few rounds Redmond funked and wanted to give
    in, but the chaps wouldn&rsquo;t let him&mdash;not even his own mates&mdash;except
    Duigan. They made him take it as long as he could stand on his feet. He even
    shammed to be knocked out, and roared out something about having broken his&mdash;ankle&mdash;but
    it was no use. And the Oracle! The chaps that knew thought that he&rsquo;d
    refuse to fight, and never hit a man that had given in. But he did. He just
    stood there with that quiet look in his eyes and waited, and, when he did
    hit, there wasn&rsquo;t any necessity for Redmond to <i>pretend</i> to be
    knocked down. You&rsquo;ll see a glint of that old light in the Oracle&rsquo;s
    eyes even now, once in a while; and when you do it&rsquo;s a sign that you
    or someone are going too far, and had better pull up, for it&rsquo;s a red
    light on the line, old as he is.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Jimmy Nowlett was a nuggety little fellow, hard as cast iron,
    good-hearted, but very excitable; and when the bashed Redmond was being carted
    off (poor Uncle Bob was always pretty high-strung, and was sitting on a log
    sobbing like a great child from the reaction), Duigan made some sneering
    remark that only Jimmy Nowlett caught, and in an instant he was up and at
    Duigan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Duigan was demoralised by his mate&rsquo;s defeat, or by
    the suddenness of the attack; but, at all events, he got a hiding, too. Uncle
    Bob used to say that it was the funniest thing he ever saw in his life. Jimmy
    kept yelling: &lsquo;Let me get at him! By the Lord, let me get at him!&rsquo; And
    nobody was attempting to stop him, he <i>was</i> getting at him all the time&mdash;and
    properly, too; and, when he&rsquo;d knocked Duigan down, he&rsquo;d dance
    round him and call on him to get up; and every time he jumped or bounced,
    he&rsquo;d squeak like an india-rubber ball, Uncle Bob said, and he would
    nearly burst his boiler trying to lug the big man on to his feet so&rsquo;s
    he could knock him down again. It took two of Jimmy&rsquo;s mates all their
    time to lam him down into a comparatively reasonable state of mind after
    the fight was over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Oracle left for Sydney next day, and Uncle Bob went with him.
    He stayed at Uncle Bob&rsquo;s place for some time. He got very quiet, they
    said, and gentle; he used to play with the children, and they got mighty
    fond of him. The old folks thought his heart was broken, but it went through
    a deeper sorrow still after that and it ain&rsquo;t broken yet. It takes
    a lot to break the heart of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And his wife,&rdquo; asked Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;what became of her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he ever saw her again. She dropped down pretty
    low after he left her&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard she&rsquo;s living somewhere
    quietly. The Oracle&rsquo;s been sending someone money ever since I knew
    him, and I know it&rsquo;s a woman. I suppose it&rsquo;s she. He isn&rsquo;t
    the sort of a man to see a woman starve&mdash;especially a woman he had ever
    had anything to do with.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And the Gippsland girl?&rdquo; asked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst part of it all, I think. The Oracle went up
    North somewhere. In the course of a year or two his affair got over Gippsland
    way through a mate of his who lived over there, and at last the story got
    to the ears of this girl, Bertha Bredt. She must have written a dozen letters
    to him, Aunt Bob said. She knew what was in &rsquo;em, but, of course, she&rsquo;d
    never tell us. The Oracle only wrote one in reply. Then, what must the girl
    do but clear out from home and make her way over to Sydney&mdash;to Aunt
    Bob&rsquo;s place, looking for Tom. She never got any further. She took ill&mdash;brain-fever,
    or broken heart, or something of that sort. All the time she was down her
    cry was&mdash;&lsquo;I want to see him! I want to find Tom! I only want to
    see Tom!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When they saw she was dying, Aunt Bob wired to the Oracle to come&mdash;and
    he came. When the girl saw it was Tom sitting by the bed, she just gave one
    long look in his face, put her arms round his neck, and laid her head on
    his shoulder&mdash;and died.... Here comes the Oracle now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell lifted the tea-billy on to the coals</p>
