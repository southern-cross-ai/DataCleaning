  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ANeglectedHistory"></a>A Neglected History</b></h2>
  <p align="center"><i>Published in&nbsp;The Republican, 1887</i></p>
  <p>We&nbsp;must admit that the Centennial celebrations in Sydney were not wholly
    useless. The glorious occasion called forth from every daily, weekly and
    monthly periodical, every advertising medium, twopenny calendar, and centennial
    keepsake, a more or less complete history of Australian progress during the
    past 100 years. The youngsters in our schools, and Australians generally,
    had thus for the first time the salient facts regarding the history of Australia
    thrust before them.</p>
  <p>If this is Australia, and not a mere outlying suburb of England: if we really
    are the nucleus of a nation and not a mere handful of expatriated people
    dependent on an English Colonial Secretary for guidance and tuition, it behoves
    us to educate our children to a knowledge of the country they call their
    own.</p>
  <p>It is a matter of public shame that while we have now commemorated our hundredth
    anniversary, not one in every ten children attending Public schools throughout
    the colonies is acquainted with a single historical fact about Australia.</p>
  <p>The children are taught more of the meanest state in Europe than of the
    country they are born and bred in, despite the singularity of its characteristics,
    the interest of its history, the rapidity of its advance, and the stupendous
    promise of its future.</p>
  <p>They can conjure with the name of Captain Cook; they are aware that he sailed
    into Botany Bay, and they have some indistinct theories regarding him, but
    of the men who in the past fought for the freedom of our constitution as
    it is, they scarcely know the names.</p>
  <p>It is of course desirable that they should be familiar with the features
    of European history, but that they should at the same time be so grossly
    unacquainted with their native land is an obvious anomaly.</p>
  <p>Select almost any Australian schoolboy from one of the higher classes and
    you will find that he can glibly recite the names of the English sovereigns
    from the Conqueror to Victoria, with the dates of their ascension. He can
    then give you their relationship to each other, and the principal events
    and noteworthy persons of each reign, with a rapidity that runs clear away
    from elocution and transmutes the English language into a kind of lightning
    gibberish. If you ask for geographical information he can quote, without
    drawing breath, the rivers, mountains and towns in Europe, and can then run
    through the counties and towns of England, repeating such names as Kent,
    Surrey, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, Wiltshire, etc., with a great relish.
    But if you ask him what town in Australia was formerly called Bendigo, or
    where Port Phillip settlement was, he becomes bashfully silent, and if you
    follow this by inquiries as to the Black War in Tasmania, or ask him the
    causes which led to the Fight of Vinegar Hill, he will come to the conclusion
    that you are  &ldquo;greening&rdquo; him, and will leave with an injured
    air.</p>
  <p>Of the gradual separation of one colony from another, of the differences
    still existing in their constitutions, and of the men and influences which
    have made them what they are he knows nothing. His knowledge of the natural
    history and geographical features of Australasia he picks up chiefly from
    the talk of his associates, and the information he casually encounters in
    the newspapers.</p>
  <p>It is quite time that our children were taught a little more about their
    country, for shame&rsquo;s sake. Are they always to be &ldquo;Colonials&rdquo; and
    not  &ldquo;Australians&rdquo;?</p>
  <p>It may be urged that the early history of Australia is for the most part
    better left unknown; but for that reason are all the bright spots, the clean
    pages, the good deeds, and the noble names, to be left unremembered too?</p>
  <p>There is apparently quite another reason why Australian history may not
    claim a place in the school&rsquo;s curriculum. It is considered necessary
    that a loyal spirit should be instilled into the minds of the rising generation:
    an attachment to a mother land which they have never seen: a &ldquo;home&rdquo;  which
    should remain always dearer to them than the place of their birth and childhood.
    This object might be considerably retarded if the children learned how the
    mother land cradled and nursed the nation they belonged to, and the measure
    of gratitude and respect they owe her for her tender guardianship: if they
    knew how the present Australian aristocracy (so loyal and sceptre loving)
    arose, and whence they came; how the Old New South Wales convict slaveholders
    and tyrants tried to drag Victoria into the sewer while she made efforts
    for liberty; how the same worthies tried to divert a convict stream into
    the northern settlement (now Queensland) that they might reap the benefit
    of convict labour; if the noble efforts of Lang resulted in the freedom of
    the mother colony, and lastly how Australian honour and interests were sold
    right and left for mammon.</p>
  <p>If all these things, and much more that might and would become apparent,
    were taught, Australian school children might develop a spirit totally at
    variance with the wishes of Australian Groveldom.</p>
  <p>They might form a low admiration for the thirty digger patriots, who on
    that eventful December morning in 1854 died in the Eureka Stockade to gain
    a juster government for their country and to baulk the first &ldquo;try on&rdquo; of
    what was no less than convict government in a free colony. They might also
    learn to love the blue flag with the white cross, that bonny &ldquo;Flag
    of the Southern Cross&rdquo;, which only rose once, but rose to mark the
    brightest spot in Australian history, and to give a severe check to that
    high-handed government which is only now gaining ground again.</p>
  <p>They might acquire a preference for some national and patriotic song of
    their own homes and their own appointed rulers, rather than to stand in a
    row and squeal, in obedience to custom and command, &ldquo;God Save our Gracious
    Queen&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>In their present state of blissful compulsory ignorance they cannot perceive
    the foolishness of singing praises of the graciousness of their condescending
    magnate, a ruler at the further end of the world who, knowing as little of
    them and their lives and aspirations as they know of her, is nevertheless
    their sovereign and potentate, and who is sometimes benevolent enough to
    send them a brief cable message judiciously filtered through her own appointed
    underling and deputy.</p>
  <p>When the school children of Australia are told more truths about their own
    country, and fewer lies about the virtues of Royalty, the day will be near
    when we can place our own national flag in one of the proudest places among
    the ensigns of the world.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AustralianLoyalty"></a>Australian Loyalty</b><br>
      <b>Sentimental And Political</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Land of the free; thy kingdom is to come.&rdquo; -
    CAMPBELL</p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &quot;The Republican&quot; (Australian Republican
    Association) 1887</i></p>
  <p>There&nbsp;can be no doubt but that without sentiment the world would be
    worse than it now is; but sentiment, though a good servant, is a bad master.
    Though not wishing to make a virtue of selfishness, it must be admitted that
    a man is more liable to make a fool of himself when actuated by feelings
    of the heart than by those of the head, and in private life we are very apt
    to sacrifice the interests of those dependent upon us, for the sake of others,
    from sympathetic motives.</p>
  <p>Sentimental loyalty has recently done both these things in a most pronounced
    manner for Australians, and perhaps stigmatised them as petty bullies, with
    a tinge of cowardice into the bargain. This was the loyalty which sent several
    hundred jingoes and several thousand pounds to assist England in crushing
    a brave nation of savages who were fighting for a country of no earthly use
    to anyone but themselves. Following closely upon the &ldquo;Contingent&rdquo;  bungle,
    and when the Russian war scare was at its height, this loyalty tumbled over
    itself in its hurry to make an independent colonial declaration of war against
    Russia by sending the money and jingoes thither. But war with Russia and
    war with the Soudanese were two very different things, and as the former
    did not come off perhaps Australia lost whatever benefit she may have derived
    from a dearly-bought lesson not to meddle in Northern affairs.</p>
  <p>Since then sentimental loyalty has gone on whining, blundering, and bullying
    through this year of Jubilee until it brought to the surface an undercurrent
    of Republicanism which long had existed in spite of the Contingent,
    in spite of the Jubilee pop and fizz, and in spite of the lying messages
    to which our Government prostituted the cable which connects us with the
    Northern world.</p>
  <p>And as sentimental loyalty has done this much for us, and brought gladness
    and hope to the heart of many a true Australian, with the knowledge that
    he is by no means alone in his convictions, we will dismiss it&mdash;with
    thanks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Australia needs the protection of England against the encroachment
    of dishonest and designing nations&rdquo; constitutes the hind legs of political
    loyalty. If the following questions are honestly answered political loyalty
    must either fall or go about on false legs, which it is most likely to do:&mdash;</p>
  <p>1.
    Are there no other nations which are not dishonest and designing on the face
    of the earth save England and her dependencies?</p>
  <p>2. Is Australia bounded by
    nations that would annex and divide her as Poland was annexed and divided,
    that she needs protection?</p>
  <p>3. Is Australia a neutral field of vantage for
    troops between two deadly hostile nations as Belgium is between France and
    Germany that she needs protection? Is Australia hated as a thief, a bully,
    and a hypocrite, as England is that she needs protection? Is Australia solid
    gold? Is she peopled by women alone; or does she misrule a nation of Irish
    and a nation of Hindoos that she needs the protection of England against
    the encroachment of dishonest and designing nations?</p>
  <p>America needed the protection of England against the encroachment of her
    (England&rsquo;s) free and easy taxation policy; and England proceeded to
    protect her in a manner essentially British. She made elaborate preparations
    to carry out the &ldquo;stamping out&rdquo; policy recently so loudly advocated
    here. But it was a game two could play, and America won it, and though the
    world was full of  &ldquo;swords and fire then&rdquo;, she has gone on ever
    since, increasing in wealth and power, checked only for a few years by &ldquo;dishonesty
    and design&rdquo;, not of other nations, but within herself. The only protection
    Australia needs is from the landlordism, the title-worship, the class distinctions
    and privileges, the oppression of the poor, the monarchy, and all the dust-covered
    customs that England has humped out of the middle ages where she properly
    belongs. Australia&rsquo;s progress has been marvellously fast, but not half
    fast enough for to-day. Once free, the spirit of independence or self-dependence
    will push her ahead 50 per cent faster. Poverty is but slightly felt in Australia,
    and therefore Australians sleep. They will awaken presently to find they
    have slumbered too long; to find the good old English gentleman over them;
    the good old English squire over them, the good old English lord over them,
    the good old English aristocracy rolling round them in cushioned carriages,
    scarcely deigning to rest their eyes on the &ldquo;common people&rdquo; who
    toil, starve, and rot for them; and the good old English throne over them
    all.</p>
  <p>They will awaken to find the cornstalk in the Australian back softened and
    made pliable by winters of poverty, and the Australian forelock accustomed
    to being pulled to &ldquo;your &rsquo;onner&rdquo; the squire and his progeny.
    Then the Australians can kick and hurt themselves as the Irish do, threaten
    and starve as the poor of England do, explode dynamite and hang as the Nihilists
    do, and curse themselves for sleeping when their rights could have been made
    invulnerable without bloodshed and without toil.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="UnitedDivision"></a>United Division</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"> <i>Published in &quot;The Republican&quot; (Australian
  Republican Association) </i>1888</p>
  <p>It&nbsp;cannot be denied that these colonies are bitterly jealous of each
    other&rsquo;s position in the esteem of the English upper crust, and that
    this jealousy has helped to make the Australians such contemptible toadies
    is amply proved by the recent visits of British big bugs to our shores.</p>
  <p>We are told that Cain killed his brother Abel because he was jealous of
    the latter&rsquo;s influence with the Lord, and we may safely assume that
    had Cain and Abel been heterodox there would have been no blood spilt between
    them. On the same line of reasoning, if Australians were to be Australians,
    or rather if Australians were as separate from any other nation as Australia
    from any other land, there would be no jealousy between them on England&rsquo;s
    account. There would of course remain little friendly rivalries between the
    colonies, but these would only act as spurs to their common prosperity.</p>
  <p>There can be no Imperial Federation in the true meaning of the word Federation.
    Imperial Federation means a union between England and each one of her colonies
    individually, whilst the colonies themselves would be divided by bitterness
    and jealousy of the meanest and most despicable kind. Say, can there ever
    be as brotherly a feeling between the Australian colonies of Great Britain
    as there would be between the United States of Australia?</p>
  <p>Why on earth do we want closer connection with England? We have little in
    common with English people except our language. We are fast becoming an entirely
    different people. We are more liberal, and, considering our age, more progressive
    than England is. The majority of English people know nothing of Australia,
    and even the higher classes understand neither us nor our country. The latter
    entertain a sort of good-natured contempt for us which is only the outcome
    of their contact with our own shoddy aristocracy, which is several degrees
    more contemptible than that of England.</p>
  <p>The loyal talk of Patriotism, Old England, Mother Land, etc. Patriotism?
    after Egypt, Burmah, Soudan, etc. Bah! it sickens one. Go and read  &ldquo;His
    Natural Life&rdquo;, and other natural lives, by Marcus Clarke, and then
    talk of the dear old Mother Land that gave us birth.</p>
  <p>Another argument used by the loyal, is that we should at least entertain
    a brotherly feeling for Englishmen and be ready to assist them in extremity.
    So we should, but we cannot assist Englishmen in Soudan or Burmah, neither
    can we assist them in Egypt with the &ldquo;eyes of centuries&rdquo; looking
    down upon us. &ldquo;Where then can we assist Englishmen?&rdquo; you ask.
    Amid the slums and alleys of London, or under the pitiless eyes of the stone
    lions (symbolical of the pity of the aristocracy) in Trafalgar Square, my
    masters!</p>
  <p>Who says Australia offers not a home for every poor Englishman, or any other
    countryman that finds his way to our shores? And what sort of thanks do we
    get for it? Take the Cockney newchum, for instance; for many years after
    arrival, the burden of his cry is &ldquo;Yer oughter go &rsquo;ome to Hingland,
    young man. Yer oughter see Lunnon, young man.&rdquo; When he is not saying
    this he is running down Australians and the country that gives him food and
    shelter to their very faces. If England is such a glorious place why do not
    all the newchums stay there, or go back as soon as they earn passage money?</p>
  <p>We shall never be understood or respected by the English until we carry
    our individuality to extremes, and by asserting our independence, become
    of sufficient consequence in their eyes to merit a closer study than they
    have hitherto accorded us. Every few weeks an English journalist or big bug
    comes out on a flying visit, drinks champagne and gorges beef with men who
    are no more representative Australians than Laplanders are, and returns to
    England a recognised authority upon the colonies.</p>
  <p>Dr Cameron Lees has just gone, and left his &ldquo;last impressions&rdquo; of
    Australians upon the page of a Melbourne daily&mdash;among a lot of type
    marks&mdash;that amount to the same thing as saying Australians are provided
    with a pair of arms and a pair of legs apiece. He says that there is a tendency
    to bounce amongst some young Australians. He is very near the truth in that
    statement, but the tendency to bounce, as he calls it, is that spirit of
    independence that is growing and spreading slowly, surely, and almost silently.
    The calm precedes a storm. Telegrams fly, war clouds spread, and the air
    is filled with rumours, but nothing happens, and when everything is calm
    again war breaks out in some totally unexpected quarter. It is the same with
    revolution; so long as the proper spirit is spreading amongst our young men,
    we are satisfied that it spreads without bombast or parade.</p>
  <p>There is one thing that we see with regret. It is that jealous, unkind feeling
    that exists between New South Wales and Victoria, and it is caused by reasons
    explained in the beginning of this article. Deny it as you may, it is nevertheless
    true that these two colonies do not entertain anything like the good-will
    that they should for each other, and although Victorians are very American
    in their egotism and very ready to disparage New South Wales, it must be
    admitted that the latter colony has not always treated the former in a fair
    spirit. The Soudan bungle was born partly of sentimental loyalty and partly
    of the afore-mentioned jealousy existing between the colonies, and now at
    a time when the colonies should club closer together our Government is doing
    all they can to widen the breach by trying to pass a bill enabling New South
    Wales to monopolise the name &ldquo;Australia&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>If this feeling of animosity is fed or permitted to grow between the two
    colonies it will end&mdash;laugh as you may&mdash;in iron and fire and cannon
    smoke rolling over the Murray!&mdash;and then! &ldquo;Perish Australia!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Federation should begin at home. If Federation &mdash;whether Imperial or
    of the world should ever appear in a better light than at present there will
    be plenty of time to consider it. But for the present, let our colonies try
    to cultivate a still more brotherly feeling for each other, and the day will
    come when the sons of all the colonies can clasp hands and say truly, &ldquo;We
    are Australians&mdash;we know no other land!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBuildingFiend"></a>The Building Fiend</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Written as a Letter to the Editor &mdash; The Bulletin &mdash; Sydney, NSW, 5 January
    1889 </i></p>
  <p>Man was given the earth to live on, but in the city Greed demands that he
    should live above it and beneath it, because one square inch of land costs
    gold, and gold is dearer than human life. Man can live a certain depth below
    the surface of the earth, and Greed demands that he should do so. Hence the
    thousands that live in the cellars and dens of our great cities. The day
    has yet to come when dwellings may be dug so deep that mechanical means may
    become necessary to supply the dwellers therein with air. We may yet have
    to pay for the air we breathe or have it cut off like gas. But Greed is never
    satisfied; a house may be twelve storeys high, and yet the very space within
    the roof is coveted. The ingenuity of the architect is taxed to save every
    inch that can yield rent, and thus we have rows of garret windows with the
    sinister look of evil things.</p>
  <p>It may be contended that garrets are not a source of danger in case of fire,
    but that on the contrary they often facilitate the escape of such inmates
    as may be cut off from below, by affording them a passage to the roof. This
    is very true in cases where the roofs are provided with parapets or other
    means of escape, but even as we write we can see a row of three garret windows
    that would afford to fire-imprisoned inmates a passage to a more damnable
    trap than Satan could invent. A roof so sloping that a cat could not climb
    it, with three garret windows out of reach of the ridge and of one another.
    The roof, unprotected by a parapet, goes down to a line of flimsy guttering
    that would scarcely bear the weight of a hen, let alone afford a footing
    for a man. Beneath this is a wall forty or fifty feet high, unbroken by a
    balcony or roof of any kind. The number of garret roofs and walls of this
    description is unlimited; you may see them in every Sydney street.</p>
  <p>Adjoining the house of which we have just spoken are the blackened walls
    and rafters of the building that was the scene of a terrible fatality on
    Christmas morn. The incident is not likely to fade quickly from the minds
    of those who witnessed it.</p>
  <p>The sun is just rising on our sunny Christmas Day when the people of Church
    Hill are aroused from their slumbers by terrible cries that ring out clear
    across the house-tops. A man, surrounded by fire and smoke, is clinging to
    a garret window, caught in the awful trap that the carelessness of landlords
    and builders has made for him. In a voice that sounds like the voice of a
    madman he calls on man and God for aid. Men who see him there shudder, and
    women faint, or wrap clothes around their heads to shut out the terrible
    cries that shall sound in their ears for many long years to come. The poor
    fellow on the roof gallantly endeavours to draw up the other man, who has
    just climbed out of the window. A parapet or bar of iron connecting these
    windows with the adjoining roof would now save two lives, but these things
    cost gold, and gold is dearer than human life.</p>
  <p>The last man slips and falls headlong. The other, stupefied by the shock
    and exhausted by heat and smoke, soon ceases his mad endeavour to tear up
    the slates and is seen to totter. Then turn your eyes away. They are carried
    out limp and crushed and bleeding, but if their death will be the means of
    bringing architects and builders to a sense of their responsibility, or the
    Government to a sense of theirs, it cannot be said that they died in vain.</p>
  <p>And now a word about the Fire Brigade. The Brigade people will probably
    shirk at the responsibility of their late arrival and the absence of the
    fire-escape by saying that the people of the boarding house failed to report
    the fire in time &mdash; that they wasted time in the hopeless endeavour
    of trying to extinguish it. But do the Fire Brigade people always expect
    to be informed of that which it is their duty to know? Where is the watchman,
    the lookout and the alarms? Is it not a shame that in these days of mechanical
    science a house may burn for half-an-hour without a single Brigade being
    aware of it? Let the Brigade people and their admirers say what they like,
    the facts are the same: two men had been killed at the burning of the Wentworth
    boarding house and a woman saved before a brass helmet was seen in the distance.
    It&rsquo;s time people got to know that it is sheer nonsense to expect the
    inmates of a burning house to do the right thing at the right time. But it
    is hopeless to expect the Government to attend to these matters in days when
    the citizens have to roll up in a mob and threaten Parliament House in order
    to make their representatives do their duty.</p>

  <p>West Australia is at present the land of promise in the south; but whether
    it will ever be anything else than a land of &ldquo;promise&rdquo; depends
    mainly on its people, and on those who are coming here to make homes &mdash; not
    those who come to &ldquo;make fortunes&rdquo;, a fact which is disregarded
    by the well-meaning but mistaken persons who are now industriously &ldquo;puffing&rdquo; West
    Australia in the other colonies.</p>
  <p>Fortune-hunters have been the curse of the eastern colonies; but, like some
    other classes, they are often more sinned against than sinning. Some years
    ago lying reports of prosperity in New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland
    were spread in the old countries, whereby inducing great numbers of young
    men to immigrate. Many of these people were fortune-hunters, no doubt, but
    it was only natural that the bitterness of their disappointment should turn
    their hearts against the land to which they had been enticed by foul means,
    and rob them of any desire to settle down, like good colonists, and by years
    of hard work and self-denial make themselves a home and the colonies a nation.</p>
  <p>The statement that these false reports were spread in England is not made
    recklessly. The writer knew a young Englishman who had in his possession
    a copy of a circular which had been scattered broadcast throughout London
    and the counties, and on which was printed what purported to be the scale
    of wages and the cost of living in Australia. It is needless to say that
    in this circular the prosperity of the colonies was grossly exaggerated.
    Amongst other equally false, and I may say criminal, representations it was
    averred that the <i>daily</i> wage of the labouring class averaged from fifteen
    shillings to a pound. We would not like to say that this circular emanated
    from the governments either of the colonies or England, but a great many
    believed it did. It was published surreptitiously.</p>
  <p>But to come to the point. Reports equally false and exaggerated as the one
    quoted above are now being spread in the east with regard to West Australia,
    enticing to this colony numbers of people who are but one remove from being
    paupers, and who have no intention of settling down and helping in the development
    of the country by the labour of their hands. Their sole idea is to &ldquo;make
    money&rdquo; and then &ldquo;clear out&rdquo;, returning to the enjoyments
    of the pleasant eastern cities.</p>
  <p>Before leaving New South Wales I heard a resident of West Australia &mdash; then
    on a visit to Sydney &mdash;  declare that <i>labourers</i> in Albany and
    Perth were receiving fourteen shillings a day; and were so independent that
    it was impossible to get a man to carry your luggage from the wharf. Of course,
    we did not believe this report, but many do, and come on the strength of
    it, and afterwards by unfavourable accounts they prevent many really desirable
    colonists from coming.</p>
  <p>Those interested in the development of West Australia seem to think that
    the only thing necessary is to get people here &mdash; and to get people
    by fair means or foul. This is a false and injurious theory. As far as population
    goes it should be a question of quality, not quantity. True colonists and
    pioneers need no other inducements than those offered by a new and fertile
    country, and fortune-hunters will flock round them like birds of prey. When
    the good colonists have made the country what it will be, the population
    will come soon enough.</p>
  <p>In the old days, when the new lands lay thousands of miles from &ldquo;home&rdquo;,
    the fortune-hunter was forced to stay, for some time at least, in the land
    to which he had recklessly hurried. There were no short passages, and cheap
    fares &ldquo;home&rdquo;, and, ten to one, by the time the immigrant was
    in a position to return, he would have settled down, reconciled to his position,
    and thus become a great colonist.</p>
  <p>But it is different with West Australia. The eastern colonies from which
    (let us suppose) she derives the population are too near; and when the new
    comer finds he has &ldquo;made a mistake&rdquo; it goes hard with him if
    he does not rectify it by returning whence he came, within six months &mdash; often
    by the next boat. And even when the fortune-hunter has made a little (West
    Australian) money, those pleasant eastern cities gleam too brightly and too
    near for him to resist the temptation to return; and so he goes on taking
    with him his, or West Australia&rsquo;s, gold, and leaving the colony poorer,
    if anything, for his visit.</p>
  <p>What we want in West Australia more than anything else, and what we must
    have before this country will follow, not say lead, on the others, and that
    which will be the colony&rsquo;s salvation is patriotism. It is very common
    to hear people who are in the habit of &ldquo;taking notice&rdquo; of things,
    say, on arriving here from the eastern colonies: &ldquo;There seems to be
    something wrong with the country.&rdquo; Most thinkers agree with them in
    this; many are positive that there is &ldquo;something&rdquo; wrong; but
    there is the widest divergence of opinion regarding the nature of this all-important &ldquo;something&rdquo;.
    One might think that there is an atmosphere of conservatism about the people;
    but, even the conditions necessary to the existence of conservatism seem
    to be wanting. In short, if I may use metaphor to express our meaning &mdash; <i>the
    people of West Australia have no existence</i>. Thousands inhabit the country,
    it is true, but as a class they take no interest in the land further than
    that conducive to a selfish individual welfare. The people do not seem to
    realise that this country has got to be made a home for a nation, or at least
    a great part of one, by the future great Australian nation, and, more than
    this, the people in (I was going to say of) this country do not seem to realise
    that the coming nation are to be of their own children. No doubt the responsibility
    and exertion of self-government will raise the minds of the West Australian
    people to a recognition of these things; but when, in the name of Heaven,
    is this Responsible Government to be brought about? The cynic answers, &ldquo;When,
    after a year or so, England shakes up West Australia and tells her that her
    sleepy request has been listened to, and that she must rouse up and mind
    shop!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Somebody, who evidently does not believe that &ldquo;God helps those who
    help themselves&rdquo; complained in the columns of a local paper that the
    other colonies took little or no interest in the welfare of West Australia.
    This is false. Upon this subject there has been more straight decisive writing
    in one Sydney paper, and more serious talk at one Sydney street corner than
    there has been in the whole of West Australia. The gist of public opinion
    in the East respecting this matter is: that West Australia must have Responsible
    Government; that it is to the interests of the eastern colonies, as well
    as of West Australia, that this should be brought about; and, that if the
    western people do not make a decisive movement in the matter soon, it will
    be necessary in the interests of Australia as a whole for the other colonies
    to take the matter up.</p>
  <p>This country should become something better than a camp for adventurers,
    who will &ldquo;fold up their tents like the Arabs and silently steal away&rdquo; (to
    Arabia). There is a great deal said about the barrenness of the land and
    its unfitness for settlement, but the same thing was said of the eastern
    portion of the continent, which is now on a fair way of becoming a paradise
    for agriculturists and graziers. Read the early despatches sent &ldquo;home&rdquo; when
    shortly after the settlement of Botany Bay the colony was described as a
    desert where nothing would grow, and yet when we left New South Wales a few
    weeks ago its driest and hottest towns were being washed off the land, and
    rescue boats were being sent up by the dozen right to the centre of the site
    of that imaginary &ldquo;Great Australian Desert&rdquo; of our grandfathers.
    The rising generation will yet see their inland seas of flood water curbed
    and stored in great artificial lakes, reservoirs, and canals, and the same
    thing can be done in the west. Some people say we want a Ballarat or two
    to make the colony. A couple of Ballarats would give us a good start no doubt,
    but that is all; Ballarats don&rsquo;t last, and we want something else to
    keep the country going.</p>
  <p>Let the natives of the colony stand up in its interests, if only because
    they are natives &mdash; that is if that grand old love for one&rsquo;s native
    land still exists in these unromantic days. Let the people who have adopted
    this as their country try and forget the old one &mdash; which could not
    have treated them well, as their continued presence here proves &mdash; and
    do the best for the country that affords them an asylum. And let the people,
    one and all, irrespective of class, creed, or nationality, do their utmost
    for the advancement of West Australia because &mdash; for the noblest of
    all reasons &mdash; because it is to be the land of their children.</p>
  <p>And afterwards, in the years that are to come, when the West will be rich
    in farms and pasturelands, and dotted with cities as fair as Adelaide, and
    as busy as Sydney or Melbourne; when mighty steamers glide in through the
    waters of the Sound, to discharge their cargoes at great bustling wharves,
    and travellers land to stroll through our parklike streets, that shall rival
    those of Ballarat, and to view our mansions and galleries of art, then &mdash; when
    there shall be streets of noble stone warehouses, and the heights shall be
    crowned by public buildings and palaces of art &mdash; then in the centre
    places shall stand the monuments, and from honoured niches in our art galleries
    shall smile the unforgotten faces of &ldquo;Our country&rsquo;s pioneers&rdquo;,
    the men who shall have earned the title of good colonists.</p>

  <p>The rivalry existing between the several towns of a colony is conducive
    in its effects to the general welfare of the colony, because such emulation
    is favourable to the formation of more equally balanced centres in different
    parts of the country, and thus leads to the general decentralisation of the
    population.</p>
  <p>Centralisation is admitted to be a blunder in any country, but in a new
    colony, which it is necessary to populate, centralisation is directly opposed
    to the principles of colonisation.</p>
  <p>The congregation of the bulk of a country&rsquo;s population in one or two
    large towns is about as sensible in idea, and as injurious in its effects,
    both physically and morally, as the crowding together of a family in one
    room of a large house, when all the other rooms are empty and available.
    A country with but one city deserving of the name is about as natural as
    a horse with one leg.</p>
  <p>The eastern colonies have learned the evils of centralisation in common
    with the evils of a great many other things, and it is to the interests of
    Western Australia (born in more enlightened days) to profit by the experiences
    of her elder sisters.</p>
  <p>The capitals of New South Wales and Victoria are out of all proportion with
    the size of their inland populations, and the size of their inland towns.
    These cities make good show windows for their respective colonies, no doubt,
    but a show window is of little use without the corresponding stock to back
    it up. The city of Ballarat stands out as a brilliant exception among the
    inland &ldquo;cities&rdquo; of the east, but Ballarat rose under exceptional
    conditions. The city of Bathurst &mdash; occupying a position in New South
    Wales corresponding (geographically) to that of Ballarat in Victoria &mdash; is
    the dullest, dreariest, sleepiest, deadest hole I ever set foot in. A few
    towns in New South Wales, like energetic little Dubbo, with its gas, etc.,
    have lately begun to wake up and go ahead, but these towns should have been
    cities long ago.</p>
  <p>I often think that if some of the surplus suburbs of Sydney were shifted
    up country a few hundred miles, New South Wales would benefit greatly by
    the change. In Sydney human beings are sardined together in a manner which
    would not be credited by the people of New South Wales, but they&rsquo;ll
    have to credit it shortly.</p>
  <p>In Sydney we have slums and &ldquo;hells&rdquo; equal to any found in London.
    We have human sties of the worst description. We have Chinamen packed in
    hundreds, over the ceilings and under the floors of &ldquo;buildings&rdquo; in
    the main street of Sydney &mdash; the notorious George Street South. We have
    hundreds of unemployed living in our parks, we have &ldquo;model lodging
    houses&rdquo;, we have ragged schools (where little children starve more
    for bread than knowledge), we have &ldquo;refuges&rdquo;, soup kitchens,
    and whole streets of brothels, and yet we point triumphantly to the &ldquo;marvellous
    growth&rdquo; of our capital city as a proof of the colony&rsquo;s prosperity.
    Marvellous growth! I would call it a rank growth rather.</p>
  <p>The foregoing sentences contain nothing but truth, and truth to which the
    general public of Sydney is wilfully blind. I have seen back roofs in Lower
    George Street where slates have been removed and substituted by sheets of
    glass in order that the reeking crowds of Chinamen and their wretched European
    women might have light enough to grope their way about in their filthy sleeping-places &mdash; over
    the ceilings.</p>
  <p>The fact about the ragged school children comes from the teacher of one
    of these schools in Kent Street, since removed to a place off Oxford Street.
    She described her pupils as being &ldquo;little better than savages&rdquo;,
    and half-starved. And now, with regard to the unemployed. On the night on
    which I embarked aboard the <i>Australien</i> for Albany I counted 135 animated
    bundles of rags and bones sleeping round the goods sheds of the Orient and
    M.M. Companies&rsquo; wharves at Circular Quay.</p>
  <p>When that old rookery the Artillery Arms fell in George Street, killing
    two people, an unsavoury stream of terrified Chinamen and their women rushed
    out from the doors of a neighbouring &ldquo;hell&rdquo;, and formed the largest
    and most disheartening crowd that I ever saw issue from a single building.</p>
  <p>It might be argued that a large city like Sydney supplies the fields with
    workers, but such an argument could easily be refuted. Now, supposing Sydney
    supplied the inland districts with people, what sort of a farmer would the
    excitable and physically weak city youth, or of what use would the wretched,
    sharp-faced, sinister-looking larrikin of Woolloomooloo, Redfern or Darling
    Harbour, be in the country or anywhere else? What sort of farmers&rsquo; wives
    would the fashionable, frivolous city girl or her wretched sisters of the
    town make?</p>
  <p>But at present Sydney does not supply the inland districts with population;
    it is generally the new arrival who goes up country. If Sydney has any influence
    over the population of the West, it is to decrease it. Where does the discontented
    farmer&rsquo;s son, who has listened to marvellous tales of the city go to?
    Where does the half-hearted farmer, who has had two or three bad seasons,
    generally drift to? And whither does she drift &mdash; the hysterical girl
    who has fallen once? The answer to these questions, nine times out of ten,
    is to the city.</p>
  <p>I can give an example, to my own knowledge, of the immigration of farmers
    to the city. I know one of the best farming districts in New South Wales,
    where from within an area of five square miles, no less than eight farmers
    left for the city during a period of five years. Let these farmers be represented
    by letters of the alphabet and I will endeavour to the best of my knowledge
    to tell what became of some of them and their farms.</p>
  <p>A. An old couple living in the city on the proceeds of the sale of their
    farm. Farm not paying subsequent purchaser.</p>
  <p>B. A large family, mother keeping a boarding-house, father and sons out
    working at various trades, girls at home and at service. Farm gone to ruin.</p>
  <p>C. Father labouring, sons ditto &mdash; farm gone to ruin.</p>
  <p>D. Small family, father, a land and building speculator, doing well. Farm
    let for a nominal rental; tenant not cultivating it, fences going to ruin.</p>
  <p>E. Large family, father &ldquo;looking for work&rdquo; and drinking; sons
    ditto; girls and wife at service; one son on farm.</p>
  <p>F. Family: father dead &mdash;  of rum and whisky &mdash; farm deserted
    and a wilderness; mother drinking; and the girls going to the bad.</p>
  <p>This is the way in which Sydney supplies the country with people.</p>
  <p>Melbourne profited by the mistakes of Sydney in the formation of her streets.
    Ballarat, Adelaide, and other rising towns are improving on Melbourne, and
    there is no reason why the future cities of Western Australia should not
    be as perfect as it is possible for cities to be. Some people will say that
    it is too soon to talk about this sort of thing, but I would like to ask
    them if the streets of Albany, for instance, are being laid out on the most
    approved plans, or likely to be a credit to the city that Albany is to be?
    I have not seen Perth or Fremantle yet, but I am inclined to fear that their
    streets are not exactly as wide or straight as those of Ballarat or Melbourne,
    and I would not be surprised to find in our northern capital or its rival,
    a Woolloomooloo, in embryo. People should insist on having their towns laid
    out on the latest and most approved plan. The western people should bear
    in mind that half-a-dozen little towns with plenty of energy, and placed
    in convenient farming or grazing centres, are worth more than one city ten
    times their congregate size. We want no regions like Little Bourke Street,
    with its stagnant lanes and blind alleys in our western cities that are to
    be.</p>
  <p>There is another evil which arises from centralisation, and which I forgot
    to mention &mdash; Carlyle might have called it &ldquo;centralism&rdquo; &mdash; it
    is the power which a great city wields over country districts. The voices
    of the country people are scarcely ever heard on momentous questions, and
    in times of popular clamour, panic, or political excitement of any kind,
    the city &ldquo;mob&rdquo; is all-powerful to rule the destiny of a nation.</p>
  <p>And now I come to think of it, New South Wales and Queensland have, during
    the present year, found out another &ldquo;mistake&rdquo; which has already
    cost them a pretty penny, and is likely to cost much more &mdash; it is the
    building of their most important towns beneath the level of flood waters.</p>

  <p>Class, creed, and nationality are words which should find no place in the
    vocabulary of the Australians, because these words are synonymous with everything
    that is hostile to the peace and happiness of the world; they are written
    deep on the bloodiest fields that ever lay under battle smoke, and their
  baneful meaning has been learnt by the fireside of many a home.</p>
  <p>The Australians, and more especially the West Australians, should judge
    a man by his worth as a colonist and a citizen, without regard to his creed
    or country. I do not object to Chinamen because they are Chinamen, nor because
    their creed is not the same as mine &mdash; I object to them because, as
    a nation, they are bad citizens and bad colonists. This may be easily seen
    when we reflect that, while the people of Sydney rose as one man and refused
    to allow a ship-load of Chinamen to land, the best known, and perhaps the
    most respected gentleman in Sydney was a Chinaman, the philanthropic Mr Quong
    Tart.</p>
  <p>Any colonial historian who has attempted to compile a history of Dr Lang
    without offending anyone can tell you that old world prejudices still exist
    in Australia; but I think I may say, with the &ldquo;pardonable pride&rdquo; of
    an Australian, that my countrymen as a rule do not get up on their liberal
    allowance of lower limbs and swear at plain facts when the facts happen to
    be unpleasant to them, so I will endeavour, from personal observations, to
    set forth the merits of the Germans as colonists, and explain wherein they
    are superior to us in this respect. I wish to write of the Germans in particular,
    because the German portion of our population is greater than that of any
    other nationality, excepting of course ourselves, and therefore the Germans
    have the greatest claim on our attention.</p>
  <p>We cannot determine wherein the colonists of one nationality are superior
    to those of another by simply comparing one colony with another, because
    England has, and always had, a monopoly of colonization. We must look nearer
    home, or rather, at home, for our comparisons, and here in Australia we can
    easily find materials for our argument.</p>
  <p>In an article entitled &ldquo;The Mistakes of Other Colonies&rdquo;, I gave
    an illustration of the influx into the city of farmers from a certain district
    in New South Wales. Now, although the great majority of farmers in this district
    were Germans, there was not one German amongst the families whom I mentioned
    as having deserted their farms, and, moreover, at this time the German farms
    were all paying well and the German families were in comfortable circumstances.
    There must be a reason for this and there can only be one &mdash; it is that
    the German farmers are better than the English, Irish and their descendants,
    better even, perhaps, than the Scotch. I have seen German and English farms
    worked side by side throughout a whole district &mdash; the Mudgee district,
    New South Wales &mdash; and the German farmers were invariably the most successful.
    By English I mean, of course, the English, Irish and their descendants in
    Australia, and for the sake of convenience I shall refer to them as Australians.
    Place an Australian on a sheep or cattle station and he will lick creation,
    as the Americans say. But put him on a farm, and ten to one he will fail
    where a German would make a fortune. I think the reason why the Australians
    cannot compete with the Germans in agriculture is because of the careless,
    easy-going disposition of the former. I don&rsquo;t want to imply that the
    Australian is lazy; he will often go to work and waste a tremendous amount
    of energy in a very short time, but what good results come from wasted energy?
    German energy is never wasted. Though the German farmer works constantly
    and persistently he seldom turns up one furrow or one spadeful of earth more
    than is necessary. The German farmer studies agriculture, even its technical
    language, and he knows what he is doing when he puts in a crop; while the
    Australian seldom knows more than that if he scratches up a bit of ground
    with the plough, throws a bit of seed wheat over it, and harrows it in he
    will most probably get a crop of wheat of some sort. Many of the back farms
    in New South Wales look like patches where the emus have been scratching.</p>
  <p>I knew a small farmer in New South Wales who had a pair of splendid draught
    horses just old enough to go to work. He also had a shed, or what they call
    a barn in England, for the storage of his wheat. The shed was not quite large
    enough to hold his last crop of grain, but it &ldquo;wasn&rsquo;t worth his
    while&rdquo; to take a day off and add a few sheets of bark to the structure.
    So, after threshing, he left a dozen bags of wheat outside the door for that
    night, and &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t bother&rdquo; covering them up because he &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t
    think it would rain&rdquo;. He also left the sliprails communicating with
    the horse paddock imperfectly fastened because he didn&rsquo;t think the
    horses would get at the wheat. That night a thunderstorm burst over the place
    and soaked everything, but not before the horses had got at the wheat and
    eaten their fill. Both horses were found dead in the morning. I give the
    story as an instance of what I may call &ldquo;native carelessness&rdquo;.
    Imagine a German farmer to be guilty of such negligence.</p>
  <p>At farming the Australians are beaten by that same dogged, methodical persistence
    that drove the French army back in disgraceful rout and captured Paris; and
    until the Australian farmers go about their work in a methodical manner,
    and call theory to their aid, they must never hope to be as successful as
    the Germans, or even compete with them. The fact that we cannot compete with
    them now is proved, by the preponderance of Teutonic names in the prize lists
    of the agricultural shows of the East.</p>
  <p>But the very fact that we cannot compete with the Germans at farming proves
    that the country has everything to gain, and nothing to lose, by their presence.
    I think that Western Australia would benefit immeasurably by an immigration
    of German farmers; I am sure the eastern colonies have done so.</p>
  <p>I believe that a great many trades unionists regard German mechanics with
    the eye of distrust because it is asserted that Germans are willing to work
    long hours, and take low wages rather than go idle for any length of time;
    but how many men in the unions would do, and do the same thing? The Germans
    who immigrate are just as democratic as the Australians, and as ready to
    stand up for the rights of labour. But, at any rate, this objection cannot
    be brought against the German farmer. Their only faults are that they often
    work their women too hard, and are apt to be a little unneighbourly at times;
    but these faults are seldom seen in mature Germans of the second and third
    generation.</p>
  <p>The Australian of German parentage differs little from the ordinary type
    of Australian &mdash; as far as it has developed. The only difference, if
    any, is that the descendants of Germans are a little more methodical and
    level-headed than the others; and I think that a time is coming when Australia
    will need all the level-headed men she can get.</p>
  <p>Germans who immigrate are not as a rule conservative; when they come out
    here they come to make the country their home, and they have sense enough
    to see that the interests of Australia lie in the same direction as theirs
    and their children&rsquo;s. And, moreover, the Germans do not bring with
    them the wretched national and religious hatreds that are the curse of our
    own &ldquo;parent&rdquo; lands.</p>
  <p>If we are to assist immigration, why should our assistance be extended to
    any one nation in particular? Why not offer encouragement to desirable colonists
    such as the Germans? Germans are just as true to their adopted lands as men
    of any other nationality; truer to Australia than some who are more closely
    related to us, and German Australians are just as patriotic as those of British
    parentage. We get the true Australian, anyway, in the course of time, and
    the sunny south will be none the less great because its people spring from
    the stoutest sons of the greatest nations on earth, and not from one or two
    nations only.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in The Albany Observer 5 July 1890<br>
  Written using the pen name &quot;Joe Swallow&quot;</i></p>
  <p>I am glad to see that the workmen of Albany are beginning to form branch
    unions here because I think that the surest and the shortest road to the
    great social reformation of the future lies through trades unionism. </p>
  <p>No doubt if a simple-minded writer attempted in this enlightened year to
    explain the objects of trades unionism he would be referred to his aged grandmother
    as a fitting pupil to undergo a course of instruction in the art of sucking
    eggs; but at the same time there are many, perhaps thousands, of intelligent
    people who hold altogether wrong ideas regarding trades unionism and its
    objects. As an instance of this, I once heard a gentleman say that trades
    unionism was an evil and unnatural thing because it was a formation of brotherhoods
    antagonistic to the formation of a universal brotherhood. I never thought
    that an intelligent man could get such a mighty grip on the bull&rsquo;s
    tail. </p>
  <p>It is true that unions are formed for protection against unprincipled labour
    as well as unprincipled capital, but if man is selfish and unphilanthropic
    enough to go in opposition to the principles of labour unionism so long as
    it is to his interest to do so he must abide by the consequences. The fault
    is his and not the union&rsquo;s. Every workman should bear in mind that
    self-denial in the individual is quite as essential to social reformation
    as it is to individual reformation. </p>
  <p>In the &ldquo;Mississippi Pilot&rdquo; Mark Twain tells the story of the
    rise of the Pilots&rsquo; Union on the Mississippi River. The promoters of
    this union were boycotted from the first, and it was only after great perseverance
    and self-denial that they were in a position to cope with their opponents.
    Then the tables turned rapidly, and the other party were soon in a position
    similar to that occupied by the unionists at the outset. Many of the old
    pilots held out to the bitter end with a courage worthy of a more philanthropic
    cause, and when they were at last compelled by necessity to seek admission
    to the union fold they were obliged to pay entrance fees of sufficient size
    to have swallowed up all the profits of their selfishness, even had they
    been in constant employment up to that time. In fact, it was with the greatest
    difficulty that some of these bitter spirits were got into the union at all.
    Perhaps these stringent measures were necessary under the circumstances,
    and considering that this was in the early days of the rise of trades unionism;
    but our unions of today are not obliged to adopt such measures and it is
    not their policy to do so. Trades unionism is not &ldquo;a formation of brotherhoods
    antagonistic to the formation of a universal brotherhood&rdquo;, as my friend
    remarked. Trades unionism really aims at the abolition of all unions and
    class distinctions, and when this is accomplished it will be no longer necessary
    for men to combine against their fellowmen. </p>
  <p>Trades unionism is a new and grand religion; it recognises no creed, sect,
    language or nationality; it is a universal religion &mdash; it spreads from
    the centres of European civilization to the youngest settlements on the most
    remote portions of the earth; it is open to all and will include all &mdash; the
    Atheist, the Christian, the Agnostic, the Unitarian, the Socialist, the Conservative,
    the Royalist, the Republican, the black, and the white, and a time will come
    when all the &ldquo;ists&rdquo;, &ldquo;isms&rdquo;, etc., will be merged
    and lost in one great &ldquo;ism&rdquo; &mdash; the unionism of labour. </p>
  <p>There is something grand in the rise and progress of trades unionism; it
    is like a great green vine growing steadily round the world and bearing fruit
    in all its branches. There is no branch union so small or remote that it
    does not contribute strength to the grand union, and there is no branch so
    insignificant and unimportant as not to be able to depend upon the assistance
    of the main unions in a good cause. </p>
  <p>I have seen the unions from Townsville to Adelaide stand up as one man,
    and demand justice for some small branch union. I have seen the stern-faced
    unionists of Sydney gather in thousands (forming a meeting that had to be
    divided into three portions) and stand for five long hours arranging plans
    of campaign and subscribing funds to carry them out, simply because a body
    of men, whom they had never seen and who were separated from them by fifteen
    thousand miles of sea, sought their assistance against a bitter wrong. I
    refer to the great dock labourers&rsquo; strike, and I must add, in justice
    to the outsiders, that many rich and influential gentlemen in Sydney, and
    many workmen outside the unions, worked like unionists on this occasion.</p>
  <p>Of course, we all know that there is one great flaw in the theory of universal
    brotherhood. It is where the Chinaman comes in. The Chinaman is a kind of
    gigantic eastern question, which will take a deal of solving. There will
    be no difficulty in including the progressive &ldquo;Jap&rdquo;  in the scheme,
    and the American negro is already a man and brother. The American Indian,
    the African and South Sea savage, and the aboriginals of Australia will soon
    in the course of civilization become extinct, and so relieve the preachers
    of universal brotherhood of all anxiety on their account. The Chinaman remains
    to be dealt with. Whether he is the going man; the descendant of a people
    who once ruled the old world and were crowded into the East by the spread
    of European civilisation, we do not know; whether he is (God forbid it) the
    coming man time alone can tell. But our time won&rsquo;t tell it, and the
    Chinese question is, I fear, one of the problems which we must leave to our
    children to solve. The Chinese nation is an unnatural, and, as far as we
    know, an unprecedented growth on the history of the world, and in all schemes
    for the furtherance of the universal brotherhood we must leave the Chinaman
    out of the question altogether; or at least until we can understand him better. </p>
  <p>For my part I think a time will come eventually when the Chinaman will have
    to be either killed or cured &mdash; probably the former &mdash; but it would
    be advisable for the world to wait further (Chinese) developments before
    taking decisive action in the matter. In the mean time we will have plenty
    of work to do by way of civilizing ourselves. I think the European nations
    should have left the Chinaman alone in the first place. </p>
  <p>The woman&rsquo;s question is another bugbear with trades unionists, and
    one which places them in a very delicate position. The position of the unions
    with regard to female labour is often misunderstood even by unionists themselves.
    It is not, as some advocates of woman&rsquo;s rights think, a question of
    trades unionism against woman, but the old question in a new guise &mdash; of
    trades unionism against cheap labour. It is all very well to say that it
    is a woman&rsquo;s place to keep house, and a man&rsquo;s place to keep her;
    but I know for a fact that many poor women in cities are obliged to go out
    and work by the day in order to feed a large family of small children and
    a lazy or drunken husband. Something must be done in this matter, either
    Adam must be compelled to keep Eve in comfort in return for her domestic
    services or Eve must be allowed to earn her living by working at such trades
    as are most suited to her strength. Of course under the existing social conditions
    Adam is not always able to keep Eve and himself in comfort, and so they both
    starve, or live in a state of starvation. But this is one of the evils for
    the cure of which trades unions exist. </p>
  <p>I think, if I may venture an opinion on the subject, woman should be allowed
    to work at such trades as are suited to her, but she should be required to
    learn the trade thoroughly, and not work for less than the union standard
    of wages. In order to do this she would have to be received into the union
    in the first place as an apprentice. I think this would do more towards keeping
    female labour within proper limits than any offensive measures could do. </p>
  <p>But the female labour question is one that cannot be disposed of in a few
    lines, and, with the editor&rsquo;s permission I would like to devote some
    future article to the question. </p>
  <p>In the mean time I would be glad if some Western writer would start a controversy
    on the subject, for the woman question will have to be dealt with sooner
    or later in Western Australia. </p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ALeaderoftheFuture"></a>A Leader of the Future</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Worker&rdquo;, Sydney, 10 June
      1893</i></p>
  <p>Some of our bards are fond of singing about a saint &mdash; a man of peace
    and love, with the form of an artist&rsquo;s model &mdash; whom they call &ldquo;the
    leader of the future&rdquo;, or &ldquo;the man that is to come&rdquo;, or
    refer to as the individual we want and are waiting for. We might wait, for
    he won&rsquo;t come. They picture an ideal Christ, not the real man; their &ldquo;leader
    of the future&rdquo; was really a leader of the past &mdash; if he ever existed.
    The Bible writers seemed to think that he did live. Anyway, we are led to
    believe that the nearest approach to Him was born in Western Asia some eighteen
    hundred years ago. He was a naturally intelligent carpenter and a Socialist.
    There were greater men in his time and before him; and there have been since;
    but he was an honest man &mdash; and original. He preached peace and goodwill
    and brotherhood, and the people hanged him &mdash; or, at least they crucified
    him, which amounts to the same thing.</p>
  <p>Another kind of leader rose in the vicinity of Mecca. They didn&rsquo;t
    hang him. His followers depended on the power of the sword rather than that
    of the tongue or pen. Sword and tongue ran a close race for centuries, and
    the sword came out ahead: the Christians couldn&rsquo;t get along without
    it. The pen and tongue are at war with the sword today &mdash; the first
    two on the side of Labour and the other on that of Monopoly. Who&rsquo;s
    getting the best of it? Labour tried the power of the sword in France a hundred
    years ago. Who got the best of it then?</p>
  <p>And yet our saviour is to be a man of peace, is he?</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The leader of the future will be a man, not a god: gods don&rsquo;t knock
    round nowadays. He&rsquo;ll rise on the top of a barricade first, perhaps,
    and when the smoke clears away we&rsquo;ll be able to see what manner of
    man he is. He&rsquo;ll most likely come with a bloodstained bandage round
    his forehead and carry one arm in a sling and a club in the hand of the other.
    His uniform will be the uniform of the unemployed. He won&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;calm,
    majestic front&rdquo; &mdash; he&rsquo;ll most likely have a rag over one
    eye and the rest of his face covered with burnt powder and dust and blood,
    and a stubby beard of a week&rsquo;s growth; also, he might have black teeth
    and a brutal cast of countenance. His language will not be Christlike, or
    Dan O&rsquo;Connor-like. His remarks will be short and to the point, and
    vulgar, and lurid, very offensive to the delicate ear. Delicate ears will
    be &ldquo;shifted&rdquo; a lot in those days.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>This leader of the future will not reason calmly and well; he&rsquo;ll not
    stop to reason at all, even if he can &mdash; he&rsquo;ll feel too mad. He&rsquo;ll
    think of his starved wife and children and the old folks, of the few pounds
    he saved out of his miserable wages and was swindled out of by &ldquo;financial
    institutions&rdquo; at the beginning of winter, and of his mates, shot down
    in the streets like mad dogs or stuck like pigs behind the barricade. He
    might feel by instinct that he is to avenge, in some part, the shameful,
    cowardly wrongs of centuries behind him. He won&rsquo;t pause to consider.
    Hatred and the sense of injustice will urge him on. He might be ignorant
    and narrow-minded &mdash; one of those men who, when they get hold of an
    idea, will stick to it as though ideas were scarce in the world and monopolised
    by companies. He will be an individualist really, and so will be the majority
    of his followers &mdash; he&rsquo;ll want revenge above all things, except
    brandy, maybe &mdash; he&rsquo;ll hate all except those who follow him &mdash; he&rsquo;ll
    want to burn down artificial things and blow them up, and comprehensively
    abolish the society which produces victims like him, and if he gets half
    a show he&rsquo;ll do it. And, now we come to think of it, he will be a god
    for the time. His followers will follow him as long as the work of destruction
    goes on and he keeps ahead of it.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The Parliament of Labour and the Parliament of Greed will go down alike
    before him &mdash; and all the little parliaments that flourish for a day &mdash; for
    his revolution will rise from beneath them all &mdash; even the lowest and
    most extreme. He will have need to depend on no league except the union of
    misery. We shall know his army when it comes by the uniform of rags. The
    Socialists of today are really working against the possibility of his coming
    because they want to reform, not to destroy. They&rsquo;ll be included in
    the general destruction. How blind the rich are!</p>
  <p>He won&rsquo;t last long at the time, if that&rsquo;s any comfort (if he
    did there would be few left to rule or be ruled) but he&rsquo;ll make things
    lively while he lasts. There will be a good many of him, and he&rsquo;ll
    turn up often in future times, and postpone the millennium some thousands
    of years.</p>
  <p>If he drinks, he will celebrate victory with a howling spree, and want to
    set up as a king on his own account, after the fashion of the Yankee Caesar
    (he of the &ldquo;Column&rdquo;), and then his followers will cut off his
    head and put it on a pole before he sobers up.</p>
  <p>Such a man will lead the people yet, and again at intervals.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OurCountrymen"></a>Our Countrymen</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Republican&rdquo;  1887</i></p>
  <p>The other day a &ldquo;Britisher&rdquo; wrote to one of our leading journals
    to say that it was very easy to be an &ldquo;Australian&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;you
    only have to wear a cabbage-tree hat and say &lsquo;bloody&rsquo;.&rdquo; We
    don&rsquo;t know about the cabbage-tree hat, it&rsquo;s getting rare &mdash; he
    might have left out the hat altogether, or any other would have done as well &mdash; but
    we have no doubts concerning the &ldquo;blank&rdquo;. Taking it all round,
    we are inclined to think that the much-abused &ldquo;new-chum&rdquo; got
    one in that time &mdash; straight from the shoulder.</p>
  <p>We are getting tired of hearing and reading about the average Australian,
    and the height of his average intelligence over that of other nationalities,
    and the average superiority of him from a physical point of view  &mdash; not
    to speak of his average morality and sobriety; and we think it about time
    he was averaged up and taken down a peg or two &mdash; for his own benefit.
    We are seeing too much of the pleasant side of truth.</p>
  <p>We are an Australian ourself. We&rsquo;re not particularly proud about it,
    or glad; though there was a time when we would swell out our manly chest
    and thump it with our fist whilst proudly declaring our nativity; but lately
    we began to entertain a most unpatriotic, irreligious doubt as to whether
    we would now be much worse &mdash; or worse off &mdash; had we been born
    a Chinaman. We merely say that we are a  &ldquo;native&rdquo; to show that
    the following ought not to be prejudiced; anyway, it will be written in the
    interests of truth &mdash; and Australia. The average Australian poet has
    written so much rot in praise of his country and countrymen &mdash;  especially
    bushmen &mdash; that whatever doubts they entertain concerning their own
    superiority are &ldquo;in a fair way of being dispelled&rdquo; &mdash; to
    let &rsquo;em down softly; and, when a man begins to think he is perfect,
    you can&rsquo;t do anything for him, God alone can help him.</p>
  <p>The average Australian boy is a cheeky brat with a leaning towards larrikinism,
    a craving for cigarettes, and no ambition beyond the cricket and football
    field; he regards his parents with contempt, takes it for granted that his
    mother mostly talks nonsense or &ldquo;rot&rdquo; when she talks to him &mdash; and
    he doesn&rsquo;t always hesitate to tell her so.</p>
  <p>The average Australian youth is a weedy individual with a weak, dirty, and
    contemptible vocabulary, and a cramped mind devoted to sport; his god is
    a two-legged brute with unnaturally developed muscles and no brains.</p>
  <p>The average Australian man has not been developed yet.</p>
  <p>It is true that the Labour cause has been ahead in Australia, but that was
    not due to the average intelligence of the Australian &mdash; the brunt of
    the battle was borne by a few exceptional men from all nations &mdash; a
    few &ldquo;grand fellows&rdquo; scattered about here and there in townships
    and shearing sheds; and now that those men are getting tired of doing all
    the work and standing all the kicks, the bottom is likely to fall out of
    the cause; it will be a &ldquo;caws&rdquo;  directly, fashionable amongst
    church people only.</p>
  <p>The average Australian bushman is too selfish, narrow-minded, and fond of
    the booze to liberate his country. The average shearer thinks that he is
    the only wronged individual, and that the squatter is the only tyrant on
    the face of the earth. Also, the shearer is too often a god-almighty in his
    own estimation; and it would be good for him to know that Australia might
    worry along if there wasn&rsquo;t a sheep in all the land.</p>
  <p>And as for the city: The Unions might be crushed, the Labour cause abolished,
    and every fat man get into parliament, and these things would be of less
    importance to the towney than the fact that Bill Somebody sprained his (blanky)
    groin at football last Saturday and mightn&rsquo;t be able to play in the
    forthcoming match.</p>
  <p>The average Australian intelligence gives a Searle the burial of a hero,
    and doesn&rsquo;t know the name of Gordon or Kendall from that of Adam; it
    thinks more about Carbine than one-man-one-vote; it tolerates mobs of animals
    called &ldquo;pushes&rdquo; in the cities, and a gang of spielers in every
    township; and it expects a few foreigners to liberate the country or keep
    it from absolute slavery &mdash; and it&rsquo;s time the average Australian
    heard about these things and mended his ways accordingly.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnArticleonMan"></a>An Article on Man</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Republican&rdquo;  1887</i></p>
  <p>It is fashionable to sneer.</p>
  <p>It could scarcely have been so fashionable in say, Byron&rsquo;s time, or
    in the time of Thackeray, because had it been so those men would never have
    been considered the great and original writers they were. For, in order to
    be original and to live, the writing of a man must be really against the &ldquo;fashions&rdquo;  of
    his time.</p>
  <p>It is fashionable to sneer nowadays; it is fashionable to say that there
    is nothing good and pure in the world. It is fashionable to laugh at the
    idea of honour among men; and it is considered wisdom to believe and act
    accordingly. It is fashionable to be a liar, a swindler, a blackguard; it
    seems even fashionable to be &ldquo;found out&rdquo;, but not clever. It
    is fashionable to be a successful thing.</p>
  <p>I am not sure how it is in other lands. These conclusions are built in Australia.</p>
  <p>It is not fashionable to write this way.</p>
  <p>Gambling, which is called &ldquo;sporting&rdquo;, is the most popular thing
    in Australia, and our best writers pander to it, because they are too blind
    to see that if they wrote as cleverly against it they would be thought a
    good deal more of.</p>
  <p>This reminds me that a &ldquo;poet of the people&rdquo; might write for
    them all his life and starve; they will scarcely recognise &mdash; just tolerate &mdash; him,
    that&rsquo;s all; but if he turns round suddenly and stings &rsquo;em pretty
    smart they will immediately begin to think a great deal of him. A smart sting
    of that sort must necessarily have truth in it, you understand.</p>
  <p>We may as well finish with writers now we have commenced. Here is a plan
    for a fashionable, or popular, Australian short story:</p>
  <p>Write three inches of marriage, and put some stars underneath; then write
    about a foot of adultery, making it as dirty, or &ldquo;racy&rdquo;, as you
    dare, or as the law allows; put some more stars, and finish up with an inch
    or two of divorce. Then that &ldquo;little thing of yours&rdquo; will be
    read, and thought a good little thing, and you&rsquo;ll be considered a very
    clever writer. But your work won&rsquo;t live longer than the issue of the
    paper in which it appears.</p>
  <p>Speaking of popular things, the most popular man in an Australian country
    town is very often the greatest rascal and the man with the flattest head.
    Were he intelligent he wouldn&rsquo;t be popular.</p>
  <p>This brings up a famous remark made long ago by a man who would have been
    wise in any generation. He was reported to have ejaculated with feeling, &ldquo;What
    foolish thing have I said that the people cheer me?&rdquo; or words to that
    effect. It was more a remark than a question. Judging his wisdom from that
    remark alone, we are inclined to think that he did make a fool of himself
    on the occasion referred to. He must have been a wise man, or he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have known it. He must have been an honest man, else he wouldn&rsquo;t have
    said it. The funniest point of the business is that for generations after
    his death the wisdom of the world whooped louder for these few words than
    for many other observations of his; and, had he gone back immediately and
    mounted the stump and told the old original crowd what he thought, the chances
    are that they would have barracked for him more enthusiastically than before.
    Such is man. But this is wandering from the point.</p>
  <p>We will have to take writers, for instance, again. You need not be truthful,
    but you must be clever; you need not be just, so long as you are humorous.
    We didn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;funny&rdquo;, because it would sound nasty there.
    The average reader looks more for humour than justice, more for smartness
    than truth, and it&rsquo;s a pity that all those things couldn&rsquo;t always
    be together.</p>
  <p>It is fashionable to look for dirt nowadays, and find it in everything.
    The Australian boy does it because he hears the Australian young man, and
    thinks it clever. He wants to be &ldquo;manly&rdquo; and for the same reason
    he smokes and drinks and becomes a larrikin. The young men see filth in most
    everything, because &mdash; because it&rsquo;s fashionable. We admire the
    manliness of the age.</p>
  <p>Suppose an average man-about-town to meet a girl who is as God intended
    her to be; the man would take her for a hypocrite; he wouldn&rsquo;t believe
    in her, because he doesn&rsquo;t believe in the purity of woman outside his
    own family circle. He might consider her the opposite to what she really
    is. Most likely he would see &ldquo;encouragement&rdquo; in the very simplicity
    or innocence of her conversation, and come to the conclusion that &ldquo;it
    would be good enough.&rdquo; That last expression might seem offensive in
    print, but then, you know, it&rsquo;s &mdash; it&rsquo;s fashionable among
    men. If the larrikin language were to be printed a few times with suitable
    comments, it wouldn&rsquo;t be used so much by gentlemen.</p>
  <p>No, a pure true girl who speaks as she thinks would be put down either as
    a hypocrite or as being &ldquo;a bit gone here&rdquo; by the average man-about-town.
    We admire the man-about-town, we have the greatest of respect and admiration &mdash;  almost
    awe &mdash; for the &ldquo;man of the world&rdquo; of today. He is so clever,
    so witty, so bitingly sarcastic, so humorous (not &ldquo;funny&rdquo;); he
    so thoroughly understands human nature &mdash; men and women; he is so infallible,
    so unassailable (not to be had, you know); so blindly, ignorantly egotistical.</p>
  <p>Damn him, for a blatant fool with a dirty mind and a dirty mouth.</p>
  <p>Put aside all the bosh about Australia&rsquo;s noble sport, her youth and
    beauty, her sun-bright skies and grassy plains, her &ldquo;shining rivers&rdquo;,
    her enterprise and her &ldquo;resources&rdquo;, her loyalty, or, on the other
    hand, her Republicanism &mdash; put aside all the rot that has ever been
    written about Australia, and what remains? The remnant of a dying race of
    men who <i>were </i>men, though somewhat small-minded, and a rising race
    of &ldquo;dudes&rdquo; and larrikins. What a land for swindlers!</p>
  <p>We will not say that Australia is becoming &ldquo;wicked&rdquo;, because &ldquo;wicked&rdquo;  is
    an &ldquo;old womanish&rdquo; word, and the user would be considered soft.
    You mustn&rsquo;t be soft nowadays; you must appear manly.</p>
  <p>It is not fashionable to prophesy, but we&rsquo;ll chance it. In a few years,
    perhaps, Australian cities will be the most unprincipled in the world, and
    dirtier than ever the British hypocrite accused Paris of being. And when
    the societies of these cities are most vicious and their witty (not funny)
    men most grandly cynical, some great man will rise and turn his soul against
    all that is fashionable in his time, and his works will create a reaction &mdash; and
    live.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Worker&rdquo;  Sydney 6 October
      1894</i></p>
  <p>It is a great pity that the word &ldquo;scab&rdquo; ever dirtied the pages
    of a workman&rsquo;s newspaper. It is a filthy term in its present meaning &mdash; objectionable
    every way you look at it. It should never be used by one man in reference
    to another, no matter how bad the other may be. It is a cowardly word, because
    it is mostly used behind a man&rsquo;s back; few men, except bullies who
    have the brute strength to back them, would call a man so to his face. If
    it is used face to face, it is only in the heat of a drunken row, the prelude
    to a fight, or in cases where the other man is physically weaker. It is a
    low, ignorant word, and only appeals to ignorance and brutality. It does
    no good &mdash; you can&rsquo;t convert a man by using that word behind his
    back; and if you do use it so, then he&rsquo;s as good a man as you are.</p>
  <p>It is a low, filthy, evil-working, ignorant, cowardly, and brutal term,
    and belongs to the slang of the brainless, apish larrikins and the drunken
    prostitutes of the city slums. A man only uses it when he hasn&rsquo;t got
    the brains to say something clean and cutting. You will often find that the
    bushman who doesn&rsquo;t swear or mix dirt with his language can cut sharper
    with his tongue when he likes than the men who do.</p>
  <p>The word free labourer is unsuitable because it conveys a false impression &mdash; one
    might as well say &ldquo;independent&rdquo;. No labourer is &ldquo;free&rdquo;,
    anyway. Let us use &ldquo;non-Unionist&rdquo; until, at least, a better word
    turns up.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Many objectionable words of another kind &mdash; often used in stump oratory
    and Labour papers &mdash; might be placed under the heading of the alleged
    words. &ldquo;Skiteley Wing&rdquo;, which is objectionable in the first place
    because it is an idiotic attempt at a pun, and a man only makes a pun when,
    if he is a writer, he wants to pander to the capacity or &ldquo;taste&rdquo; of
    the ignorant; or when he has not the brains to make anything else.</p>
  <p>Such words are objectionable because they are senseless, too senseless even
    to be ridiculous &mdash; they are childish, silly. We wonder how any full-grown
    man with the usual quantity of brains could raise a smile at such silly,
    childish mumble-jumble. It would be deemed beneath the contempt or intelligence
    even of a city gutter boy.</p>
  <p>Now, taking the widest possible view and admitting that there might be a
    meaning implied in these sounds, how many of our correspondents who use the
    term &ldquo;Skiteley Wing&rdquo; have the ghost of a reason to think that
    King (with all his crimes) is a skiter? Then take the silly name &ldquo;Georgy-Porgy&rdquo;,
    as used by some beacons of light and liberty in connection with Dibbs. Now &mdash; always
    admitting that there is a language (sort of &ldquo;language of music&rdquo;)
    in the sounds  &mdash; can Dibbs&rsquo; bitterest and most extreme hater
    truthfully and reasonably state that he thinks there is anything &ldquo;Georgy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Porgy&rdquo; about
    him?</p>
  <p>Let us talk straight in plain English, and not weaken our arguments with
    silly sounds that mean nothing.</p>
  <p>Which reminds us that we once heard a courtly gentleman of the old school
    say to a young &ldquo;lady&rdquo; at a picnic up country:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you are an icicle, Miss Brown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then she, with a desire to show off, made answer sharply: &ldquo;Then, <i>I&rsquo;m </i>afraid
    you&rsquo;re a <i>kysical, </i>Mister Lowe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is no such word, Miss Brown,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes there is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He bowed, and turned away; and she left also with a very red face. She always
    hated him after that, of course &mdash; being a woman.</p>
  <p>Try to make every man, who uses silly sounds in his arguments, feel and
    look as foolish as that young lady did, and by-and-by we&rsquo;ll have less
    funny business and bosh, and more sense in our labour literature and oratory.</p>
  <p>There are many words in the &ldquo;language of liberty&rdquo; which, although
    they were good words originally, have been so abused, gushed about, and used
    by hypocrites, fanatics, and ranters, that they are now almost on a par with
    the cant of Christianity. &ldquo;Truth&rdquo; is one of them &mdash; it might
    now be mistaken for &ldquo;Trewth&rdquo;;  &ldquo;Comrade&rdquo; is another; &ldquo;Tyranny&rdquo; is
    another, and also &ldquo;Liberty&rdquo;, or Freedom itself. The word &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; always
    suggests to me a bilious fanatic who calls himself a &ldquo;Socialist&rdquo;,
    and who has no faith in human nature &mdash; his own included.</p>
  <p>That egotistic word &ldquo;mateship&rdquo; &mdash; which was born of New
    Australian imagination, and gushed about to a sickening extent &mdash; implied
    a state of things which never existed any more than the glorious old unionism
    which was going to bear us on to freedom on one wave. The one was altogether
    too glorious, and the other too angelic to exist amongst mortals. We must
    look at the nasty side of truth as well as the other, the conceited side.
    When our ideal &ldquo;mateship&rdquo; is realised, the monopolists will not
    be able to hold the land from us.</p>
  <p>There are four words which will be fondly remembered by us when we are old
    men, and when the A.W.U. will only remember with shame that so many of its
    members were foolish and ignorant enough to use and admire such words as &ldquo;scab&rdquo;,
    and &ldquo;Skiteley Wing&rdquo;. These four words &mdash; &ldquo;chum&rdquo;, &ldquo;jolly&rdquo;, &ldquo;mate&rdquo;,
    and &ldquo;sweetheart&rdquo;  &mdash; will never die.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo;  27
      February 1897</i></p>
  <p>British ignorance of Australia is certainly no greater than the coastal
    Australian&rsquo;s ignorance of the Australian back country. The people of
    our cities look at the bush proper through the green spectacles of bush bards
    and new-chum press-writers, and are content &mdash; wisely, if they knew
    it &mdash; to sit down all their lives on the rim of Australia.</p>
  <p>No one who has not been there can realise the awful desolation of Out Back
    in ordinary seasons; few even of those who have tramped there can realise
    it. One might imagine a tropical jungle, a &ldquo;glittering&rdquo; ice-field,
    a &ldquo;rolling&rdquo;  prairie, a &ldquo;Northern&rdquo; forest, an &ldquo;African&rdquo; desert;
    but not a mighty stretch of country which is neither desert nor fertile land,
    nor anything else you can think of &mdash; except thousands of miles of patchy
    scrub. A region which is not quite desert enough to be provided with oases,
    nor tolerable enough to have permanent rivers. A region where there are no
    seasons to speak of; where the surface will bake for nine months or a year,
    and then suddenly become a boundless marsh; where the single river, flowing
    between drought-baked banks and under blazing skies, will rise from a muddy
    gutter to a second Mississippi, because of the Northern rains. A country
    where human life can just exist; a country that carries sheep with difficulty
    in fair seasons &mdash; though at first sight you would think it incapable
    of carrying goats at its best &mdash; and their worst.</p>
  <p>If the back country were a desert we might love it, as the Arabs are alleged
    to love their desert, for the sake of the oases; if it were a region of noble
    ranges, mighty forests, shining rivers, broad lakes, and grassy plains, we
    would love it for these things; as it is, we don&rsquo;t know how to take
    it, and prefer not to take it at all &mdash; at least not until a general
    earthquake or a mighty scheme of irrigation breaks the dreadful monotony,
    and alters the face of it beyond recognition.</p>
  <p>I have been accused of painting the bush in the darkest colours from some
    equally dark personal motives. I might be biased &mdash; having been there;
    but it is time the general public knew the back country as it is, if only
    for the sake of the bush outcasts who have to tramp for ever through broiling
    mulga scrub and baking lignum, or across blazing plains by endless tracks
    of red dust and grey, through a land of living death.</p>
  <p>After reading bush literature in prose and verse, and after trying the bush
    for myself, I feel inclined to doubt all scenery that is boomed. But Bill
    and Jim do not see the bush as it is; and if they write verses about it &mdash; as
    they frequently do in camp &mdash; they put in shining rivers and grassy
    plains, and western hills, and dawn and morn and eve and gloaming, and forest
    boles of gigantic size &mdash; everything, in fact, which is not and never
    was in bush scenery or language; and the more the drought bakes them the
    more inspired they seem to become. Perhaps they unconsciously see the bush
    as it should be, and their literature is the result of a craving for the
    ideal.</p>
  <p>I watched a mate of mine sit down in camp on the parched Warrego &mdash;  which
    was a dusty gutter with a streak of water like dirty milk &mdash; and write
    about &ldquo;the broad, shining Darling&rdquo;. The Darling, when we had
    last seen it, was a narrow streak of mud between ashen banks, with a barge
    bogged in it. Two weeks later this mate was sitting in a dusty depression
    in the surface, which he alleged was the channel of a river called the Paroo,
    writing an ode to &ldquo;the rippling Warrego&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The average Australian bushman may exult in the bush because he has never
    seen any desert country to compare it with. Mainland shearers clear out by
    the next boat they can catch after they get their cheques. But my Warrego
    bard was born in St Petersburg, and had travelled through France and some
    of the fairest countries on earth. Ideal bush literature is an interesting
    subject, anyway, and it is written and accepted as realistic by the bushmen
    themselves. Its popularity is wonderful, and most pathetic.</p>
  <p>The moral is the universal one: &ldquo;Let us irrigate&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>The bush bard, in fact, is temporarily blinded to the Real by the intensity
    of his own vision of the Ideal. Sun-pictures fade idly on his retina; his
    brain is stimulated by a Light from Within. It is a case not uncommon:</p>
  <p>The lover &ldquo;beauteous Helen&rdquo; names<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Ethiop black as coal;<br>
    For Cupid takes to light his flames,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-rays of the Soul.</p>
  <p>The mother of a horse-faced boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hugs his dirty doll<br>
    With &ldquo;Pretty child!&rdquo; will, sure, employ<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-rays of the Soul.</p>
  <p>The bard who writes &ldquo;fair, shining lake&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of &ldquo;muddy hole&rdquo;,<br>
    And &ldquo;trees&rdquo; for &ldquo;mulga scrub&rdquo;, must take<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-rays of the Soul.</p>
  <p>No wonder seek the Wordsworth band<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &ldquo;light&rdquo; from pole to pole;<br>
    They never share &ldquo;on sea or land&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The X-rays of the Soul.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="CrimeintheBush"></a>Crime in the Bush</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo;  11
      February 1899</i></p>
  <p>The average city man&rsquo;s ignorance concerning the nearer bush &mdash; to
    say nothing of &ldquo;Out Back&rdquo; &mdash; and the human life therein,
    is greater even than the average new-chum&rsquo;s, for the new-chum usually
    takes pains to collect information concerning the land of his exile, adoption
    or hope. To the city mind the drovers, the shearers, the station hands, the &ldquo;cockies&rdquo; or
    farmers, the teamsters, and even the diggers, all belong to one and the same
    class, and are accepted in the street under the general term of &ldquo;bushies&rdquo; &mdash; and
    no questions asked. The city mind is too much occupied by the board-and-lodging
    or rent problems, etc., to have any but the vaguest ideas concerning the
    unique conditions of the life that lies beyond the cities. And, in return,
    the Sydney or Melbourne man is regarded out back as a jackeroo or new-chum &mdash; little
    or no distinction being made between the Australian-born &ldquo;green-hand&rdquo; and
    the newly-arrived cockney; which is just. But it is with the farmer or &ldquo;cockie&rdquo;  class
    that the writer is here chiefly concerned, for it is mostly in the so-called &ldquo;settled&rdquo; districts
    that are committed the crimes which seem so brutally senseless or motiveless
    to city people.</p>
  <p>The shearer is a social animal at his worst; he is often a city bushman  &mdash; i<i>.e., </i>a
    man who has been through and round and between the provinces by rail and
    boat. Not unfrequently he is an English public school man and a man of the
    world; so even the veriest outback bushie, whose metropolis is Bourke, is
    brought in touch with outside civilisation. But there are hundreds of out-of-the-way
    places in the nearer bush of Australia &mdash; hidden away in unheard-of &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; in
    the ranges; on barren creeks (abandoned by pioneering farmers and pastoralists &ldquo;moving
    up country&rdquo; half a century ago); up at the ends of long, dark gullies,
    and away out on Godforsaken &ldquo;box&rdquo;, native-apple, or stringy-bark
    flats &mdash; where families live for generations in mental darkness almost
    inconceivable in this enlightened age and country. They are often in a worse
    condition mentally than savages to the manner born; for natural savages have
    a social law, a social intercourse &mdash; perhaps more or less inadequate,
    but infinitely better than none at all. Some of these families live from
    one year&rsquo;s end to another without seeing a face except the face of
    somebody of their own class, and that of an occasional stranger whose character
    or sanity must at least be doubtful, to explain his presence in such places.
    Some of these families are descended from a convict of the worst type on
    one side or the other, perhaps on both; and, if not born criminals, are trained
    in shady ways from childhood. Conceived and bred under the shadow of exile,
    hardship or &ldquo;trouble&rdquo;, the sullen, brooding spirit which enwraps
    their lonely bush-buried homes will carry further their moral degradation.
    You may sometimes see a dray or spring-cart, of antiquated pattern, dragging
    wearily and unnoticed into the &ldquo;township&rdquo;, and containing a woman,
    haggard and spiritless-looking, or hard and vicious-faced &mdash; or else
    a sullen, brooding man &mdash; who sells produce for tea, flour, and sugar,
    and goes out again within the hour, without, perhaps, having exchanged half-a-dozen
    words with anyone. This is the only hint conveyed to the outer fringe of
    God&rsquo;s country &mdash; and wasted on apathetic neighbours &mdash; of
    the existence of such a people.</p>
  <p>These places need to be humanised. There are things done in the bush (where
    large families, and sometimes several large families, pig together in ignorance
    in badly partitioned huts) known well to neighbours; or to school-teachers &mdash; mere
    lads, going through their martyrdom in such places &mdash; and to girl-teachers
    too, God forgive us! &mdash; or even to the police; things which would make
    a strong man shudder. Clean-minded people shrink from admitting the existence
    of such things, until one, bolder than the rest, and with the certainty of
    having his or her good name connected with, perhaps, one of the dirtiest
    cases known to police annals, speaks up for the sake of outraged nature and
    reason, and &ldquo;horrifies&rdquo; Australia. But too often the informant
    is one of the brooding, unhealthy-minded ruck who speaks up only from mottoes
    of envy or revenge.</p>
  <p>We want light  &omicron;n these places. We have the crime of the Dederers &mdash; the
    two brothers who killed their father and burned the body as they would have
    burned a log, and yet seemed quite unconscious of having done anything out
    of the common. To those who know the conditions under which many families
    like the Dederers exist in Australia, their crime is neither inexplicable
    nor particularly astounding. The Dederers, if I remember rightly, were reported
    as never having been even to the nearest &ldquo;township&rdquo; in their
    dark lives. No doubt they were incapable of expressing, in any sort of language,
    bush or otherwise, what they felt; if, indeed, they felt anything.</p>
  <p>Such dark ignorance is especially dangerous because it is apelike in its &ldquo;emotions&rdquo;,
    in its likes and dislikes. There are families in the bush with the male members
    of whom an intelligent and experienced bushman would never trust himself
    alone &mdash; if he had reason to be satisfied with the natural shape of
    the back of his head; nor yet with the female members &mdash; if he valued
    his neck and the <i>post mortem </i>memory of him. You might be mates with
    a man in the bush for months, and be under the impression that you are on
    the best of terms with him, or even fancy that he has a decided liking for
    you, and yet he might brood over some fancied slight or injury &mdash; something
    you have said or done, or haven&rsquo;t said or done &mdash;  anything, in
    fact, that might suggest itself to an ignorant, morose, and vindictive nature &mdash; until
    his alleged mind is in such a diseased condition that he is capable of turning
    on you any moment of the day or night and doing you to death.</p>
  <p>So the respectable farmer &mdash; too outspoken and careless, perhaps, but
    good-hearted, and never dreaming of the existence of an enemy &mdash; turning
    to slumber again after the &ldquo;cockcrow&rdquo; hitch in his sleep, hears
    a furtive whistle and the clatter of retreating hoofs on slanting sliprails
    and thinks it is some over-late or early neighbours passing through; but
    starts wide enough awake next time to see the glare, sniff the smoke, and
    hear the roar and crackle of fire, and, rushing out, white-faced and with
    heart standing still, finds a shed or stack &mdash; the stack of unthreshed
    wheat, perhaps &mdash; in flames. The crime of arson used to be very, very
    common in Australia &mdash; and no &ldquo;land laws&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrongs
    of Ireland&rdquo; to explain its prevalence. Such malice is terrifying to
    those who have seen what it is capable of. You never know when you are safe,
    no matter how carefully you guard your words, looks, or actions; and the
    only remedy &mdash;  for the application of which the law would promptly
    hang you &mdash; would be to sit up nights with a gun with a chalked sight,
    until you get a glimpse of your ape-minded and unprovoked enemy, and then
    carefully shoot him.</p>
  <p>There are places in Australia where the existence of the evil eye and of
    witches is believed in; and where national, religious, and clan hatreds,
    which perhaps have died out in the old-world countries from which they came,
    are preserved in their original intensity; where is all the ignorant suspicion
    and distrust of a half-savage peasantry. The police, whose duty it is to
    collect returns for harmless agricultural statistics, can tell you of the
    difficulty they experience &mdash; and not in such out-of-the-way localities
    either &mdash;  and of the obstacles thrown in their way when trying to obtain
    the barest reliable information. &ldquo;Experienced great difficulty in obtaining
    information from landholders&rdquo;; &ldquo;Declines to supply necessary
    information&rdquo;; Still refuses&rdquo;, etc., are common on the margins
    and &ldquo;remark&rdquo; spaces of returned and re-returned schedule-forms.
    Perhaps the cruellest of all the bad sights of the bush is the case of the
    child born to a family with which it has nothing in common mentally (possibly
    physically) &mdash; the &ldquo;throw-back&rdquo; to original and better stock &mdash; whose
    bright mind is slowly but surely warped to madness by the conditions of life
    under which the individual is expected to be contented and happy. Such warped
    natures are often responsible for the worst sexual crimes. There are brutally
    selfish parents in the bush who regard and work their children as slaves &mdash; and
    worse. Any experienced bush schoolteacher could bear me out in this, with
    heart-rending stories of child slavery and ill-treatment almost past belief.
    I remember the case of a boy who attended night-school with me for a few
    months in the bush. His parents sent him under pressure of &ldquo;public
    opinion&rdquo;. He had to work from daylight until after dark, and do the
    work of a man &mdash; or be starved and beaten to it. He was nineteen, and
    an idiot. But some people said that he was only an adopted son.</p>
  <p>Democratic Maoriland, with its natural and geographical advantages over
    Australia, is yet not free from the dark spot I refer to. I have known three
    white children at a Maori (native) school who belonged to a family of (originally)
    seventeen children. Two or three of the family were alleged to be the children
    of the eldest unmarried daughter. Of the three who attended school, two girls
    and a boy, the boy was over fourteen; the girls eight and nine. The boy was
    ignorant even of the existence of an alphabet. He had the face of a wegzened,
    vicious little old man; and a good deal of the nature. The girls&rsquo; faces
    were little masks of what their mother&rsquo;s might have been were she twenty
    or thirty years older. Both parents looked younger and fresher than the children.
    Boy and girls rose at daylight, cooked their parents&rsquo; breakfast (bacon,
    eggs, etc.), carried it in to them, had a meal of bread and fat, and, when
    necessary, went into the bush to cut and get together a load of firewood.
    And the girls were eight and nine. The boy&rsquo;s physical development was
    naturally abnormal, but his head didn&rsquo;t seem to belong to his body.
    Sons can be overworked, starved, stunted mentally, and otherwise cruelly
    treated to such an extent that they are capable of turning upon and killing
    a brutish parent &mdash;  just as savage slaves will, when they get the chance,
    kill their savage masters.</p>
  <p>Then there is the unprovoked, unpremeditated, passionless, and almost inexplicable
    bush murder, when two mates have lived together in the bush for years, until
    they can pass days and weeks without exchanging a word, or noticing anything
    unusual in the circumstance &mdash; till the shadow of the over-hanging,
    brooding ridge, or the awful monotony of the horizonless plain, deadens and
    darkens the mind of one so that the very presence of his mate, perhaps, becomes
    a constant source of vague but haunting irritation. Then, one day, being
    behind the other with an axe or an adze to his hand, he suddenly, but dispassionately,
    smashes his skull, and is afterwards utterly unable to account for his action
    except by the muttered explanations that he &ldquo;had to do it&rdquo;, or &ldquo;something
    made me do it&rdquo;. Bush loneliness has the same sort of influence on the
    blackfellow alone with whites &mdash; as instance the latest reported crime
    committed by a blackfellow, who afterwards expressed sorrow for killing the &ldquo;poor
    old man&rdquo;, but couldn&rsquo;t understand why he did it, unless it was
    because the white man, having stooped to drink, was in &ldquo;such a good
    position for killing&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Such crimes as those just instanced, and worse, might be described as the
    ultimate result of a craving for variety &mdash; for something better or
    brighter, perhaps, but, anyway, something <i>different  &mdash; </i>the protest
    of the outraged nature of the black or white savage against the &mdash; to
    him &mdash; unnatural conditions.</p>
  <p>Respectability only intensifies the awful monotony of these wretched bush
    townships &mdash; till the women are forced to watch for dirt and holes in
    a neighbour&rsquo;s washing hung out on the line, and men to gossip and make
    mischief like women. Shortcomings in a neighbour are talked about and exaggerated &mdash; and
    invented. Even a tragedy is secretly welcomed notwithstanding the fact that
    the whole community is supposed, in double-column headlines, to be horrified.
    Careless remarks are caught up, disturbed, and magnified. No respectable
    girl can leave the township on an innocent visit without something discreditable
    being discovered to be connected with her departure from the wretched hole.
    City spielers attach themselves to local pubs, and prey with little or no
    disguise on idiotic cheque-men; bush larrikins &mdash; who are becoming more
    contemptible and cowardly than their city prototypes openly boast of their &ldquo;successes&rdquo;,
    and give the girl&rsquo;s name. And both classes are accepted as commonplace &mdash; the
    community never dreams of giving them an hour&rsquo;s start to get out of
    reach of <i>men, </i>or stand the penalty.</p>
  <p>Then there is the miserable bush feud which arises (perhaps started generations
    ago &mdash; the original cause forgotten) over a stray bull, a party fence,
    a girl, a practical joke, a misunderstanding or a fancied slight &mdash;  anything
    or nothing; and is brooded over by men who have little else to think about
    in the brooding bush. There is the threat to &ldquo;pull yer&rdquo; and have
    satisfaction &mdash; the miserable court case and cross action brought on
    the paltriest pretences that ever merited the disgust of a magistrate &mdash;  intensifying
    hatreds to a murderous degree. And &ldquo;friends&rdquo; aid and abet and
    fan the hell-fire in men&rsquo;s hearts, till at last birth is given to the
    spirit that sneaks out after dark and cuts a neighbour&rsquo;s wire-fences,
    or before daylight and stands a gate ajar, or softly lets down the rails
    that a neighbour&rsquo;s own cattle may get into his crop or garden, destroying
    the result of months of weary toil and taking the food out of his children&rsquo;s
    mouths. The spirit that shoots or hamstrings horses grazing under the starlight;
    that sets a match to stack or shed.</p>
  <p>Mischief breeds mischief; malice, malice; and the tongues of the local hags
    applaud and chorus, and damn and exaggerate and lie, until the wretched hole
    is ripe for a &ldquo;horror&rdquo;. Then the Horror comes.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; 18
      November 1893</i></p>
  <ol>
    <li>An Australian mirage does not look like water; it looks too dry and dusty.</li>
    <li>A plain is not necessarily a wide, open space covered with waving grass
      or green sward, like a prairie (the prairie isn&rsquo;t necessarily that
      way either, but that&rsquo;s an American mistake, not an Australian one);
      it is either a desert or a stretch of level country covered with wretched
      scrub.</li>
    <li>A river is not a broad, shining stream with green banks and tall, dense
      eucalypti walls; it is more often a string of muddy waterholes &mdash; &ldquo;a
      chain of dry waterholes&rdquo;, someone said.</li>
    <li>There are no &ldquo;mountains&rdquo; out West; only ridges on the floors
      of hell.</li>
    <li>There are no forests; only mongrel scrubs.</li>
    <li>Australian poetical writers invariably get the coastal scenery mixed
      up with that of &ldquo;out back&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>An Australian Western homestead is not an old-fashioned, gable-ended,
      brick-and-shingle building with avenues and parks; and the squatter doesn&rsquo;t
      live there, either. A Western station, at best, is a collection of slab
      and galvanised-iron sheds and humpies, and is the hottest, driest, dustiest,
      and most Godforsaken hole you could think of; the manager lives there &mdash; when
      compelled to do so.</li>
    <li>The manager is not called the &ldquo;super&rdquo;; he is called the &ldquo;overseer&rdquo; &mdash; which
      name fits him better.</li>
    <li>Station-hands are not noble, romantic fellows; they are mostly crawlers
      to the boss &mdash; which they have to be. Shearers  &mdash; the men of
      the West &mdash; despise station-hands.</li>
    <li>Men tramping in search of a &ldquo;shed&rdquo; are not called &ldquo;sundowners&rdquo; or &ldquo;swaggies&rdquo;;
      they are &ldquo;trav&rsquo;lers&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>A swag is not generally referred to as a &ldquo;bluey&rdquo;  or &ldquo;Matilda&rdquo; &mdash; it
      is <i>called </i>a &ldquo;swag&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>No bushman thinks of &ldquo;going on the wallaby&rdquo;  or &ldquo;walking
      Matilda&rdquo;, or &ldquo;padding the hoof&rdquo;; he goes on the track &mdash; when
      forced to it.</li>
    <li>You do not &ldquo;hump bluey&rdquo; &mdash; you simply &ldquo;carry your
      swag&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>You do not stow grub &mdash; you &ldquo;have some tucker, mate&rdquo;.</li>
    <li>(Item for our Australian artists). A traveller rarely, if ever, carries
      a stick; it suggests a common suburban loafer, backyards, clothes-lines,
      roosting fowls, watchdogs, blind men, sewer-pipes, and goats eating turnip-parings.</li>
    <li>(For artists). No traveller out back carries a horse-collar swag &mdash; it&rsquo;s
      too hot; and the swag is not carried by a strap passed round the chest
      but round <i>one </i>shoulder. The nose (tucker) bag hangs over the other
      shoulder and balances the load nicely &mdash; when there&rsquo;s anything
      in the bag.</li>
    <li>It&rsquo;s not glorious and grand and free to be on the track. Try it.</li>
    <li>A shearing-shed is not what city people picture it to be &mdash; if they
      imagine it at all; it is perhaps the most degrading hell on the face of
      this earth. Ask any better-class shearer.</li>
    <li>An Australian lake is not a lake; it is either a sheet of brackish water
      or a patch of dry sand.</li>
    <li>Least said about shanties the better.</li>
    <li>The poetical bushman does not exist; the majority of the men out back
      now are from the cities. The real native out-back bushman is narrow-minded,
      densely ignorant, invulnerably thick-headed. How could he be otherwise?</li>
    <li>The blackfellow is a fraud. A white man <i>can </i>learn to throw the
      boomerang as well as an aborigine &mdash; even better. A blackfellow is <i>not </i>to
      be depended on with regard to direction, distance, or weather. A blackfellow
      once offered to take us to better water than that at which we were camping.
      He said it was only half-a-mile. We rolled up our swags and followed him
      and his gin five miles through the scrub to a mud-hole with a dead bullock
      in it. Also, he said that it would rain that night; and it didn&rsquo;t
      rain there for six months. Moreover, he threw a boomerang at a rabbit and
      lamed one of his dogs &mdash; of which he had about 150.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;etc. Half the bushmen are <i>not </i>called &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;,
      nor the other half &ldquo;Jim&rdquo;. We knew a shearer whose name was
      Reginald! Jim doesn&rsquo;t tell pathetic yarns in bad doggerel in a shearer&rsquo;s
      hut &mdash; if he did, the men would tap their foreheads and wink.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>In conclusion. We wish to Heaven that Australian writers would leave off
    trying to make a paradise out of the Out Back Hell; if only out of consideration
    for the poor, hopeless, half-starved wretches who carry swags through it
    and look in vain for work &mdash; and ask in vain for tucker very often.
    What&rsquo;s the good of making a heaven of a hell when by describing it
    as it really is we might do some good for the lost souls there?</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DroughtStricken"></a>Drought-Stricken</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Daily Telegraph&rdquo;  Sydney
      28 Feb 1903</i></p>
  <p>A dusty patch in the Dingo Scrub,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was cleared and ploughed in vain &mdash;<br>
    (What matters it now if the soil be soaked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bush be dark with rain?)<br>
    A heap of stones where the chimney stood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a post on the boundary line &mdash;<br>
    For forty years of my father&rsquo;s life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fifteen years of mine.</p>
  <p>It is so hard to make city people understand. If you went out into the dry
    country now you would wonder not only how sheep or cattle, or even goats,
    could survive in the drought, but how strong men could live through it. Strong
    men die often in the heat wave &mdash; and what of the women and children
    out there?</p>
  <p>It is a blazing desolation. No sign of crops, no sign of grass, the sods
    bake white and crumble to dust on the ploughed ground &mdash; the surface
    under the scrub is as bare as a road, and as dusty. Imagine it! nothing but
    dust and sand and blazing heat for hundreds of miles! All road, all dust.
    And where is the water? that is one of the first questions that occur to
    you; for there is no more sign of water than there is of grass. The water
    is at the &ldquo;bore&rdquo;, or in a muddy hole down the creek, or in a
    dam or tank, with a screen of saplings and boughs over it sometimes, to lessen
    evaporation. The water is thick and yellow, or the colour of dirty milk,
    and warm. They have to drink it. And what if the last gallon evaporated,
    and the next water five, ten, fifteen, or twenty miles away? Well, they&rsquo;d
    have to take the stock to the water and camp there, or cart it for household
    purposes on drays in tanks and barrels. And if the nearest water wasn&rsquo;t
    within reach? what would they do then? God knows! &mdash; I don&rsquo;t;
    but God generally sends a shower at the last moment. What do you know of
    it, who step a few feet to your tap or filter for a clean, cool drink?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The country looks awful!&rdquo; they say, and that expresses it.
    But you couldn&rsquo;t realise the drought unless you saw it &mdash; and
    then you couldn&rsquo;t realise it unless you lived through it; and even
    then &mdash; well a man does not know what he can go through and leave behind
    him as an evil dream. The country in the drought is dreadful &mdash; it is
    enough to terrify a new chum; but I heard someone say that men could get
    used to the infernal regions, and, after going through several droughts,
    I am inclined to believe it.</p>
  <p>It blazes all day &mdash; you can see the white heat flowing, dancing, dazzling &mdash; and
    it is stifling all night. Often the smothering hot night is worse than the
    fiercely glaring day. I had a fancy that one could hear the drought; you&rsquo;ve
    heard the something devilish in the roar of a fire where a fire should not
    be? &mdash; a house on fire &mdash; well, it seemed something like that.</p>
  <p>Haggard eyes stare vainly at every sign of a cloud for rain. The great white
    sun rises with almost the heat of noon; and so, day after day, week after
    week, month after month, until people cease to hope, or even to waste words
    suggesting that it might rain soon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whenever are we going to get a little rain?&rdquo; says the baked,
    gaunt Bushwoman, wearily &mdash; and that is all. What do you know of it,
    you who have not sacrificed the best years of your manhood, the youth of
    your sons and daughters, and every trace of girlish beauty in your wife&rsquo;s
    face, trying to make a home in the Bush? What do you know of it, who have
    not been ruined by the drought time and time again? What do you know of it,
    who did not depend for a year&rsquo;s provisions on the crop that was scorched
    from the surface as it sprouted, or the cows and steers that starved to death
    one by one before your eyes?</p>
  <p>And what do the well-meaning good people of the city know of the Bush people
    who suggest making them objects of charity! If I went into a bare, drought-stricken
    Bush home to-day, I would glance round and understand it all, but I wouldn&rsquo;t
    know what to say. I&rsquo;d be no longer in touch with them &mdash; I&rsquo;d
    not be suffering with them. I wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to sympathise with them
    (except perhaps in the case of a quarrel with a neighbouring squatter), for
    they have no use for sympathy, and the strangeness of it would embarrass
    them. I&rsquo;d sit and feel very ill at ease, and I could not meet the Bushwoman&rsquo;s
    haggard eyes, that look one through and through and size one up; for I&rsquo;d
    feel the poor weak citified creature I am. I&rsquo;d as soon think of striking
    my father in the face, were he alive, as dream of offering that Bushwoman
    food and clothes for her family, or putting my hand in my pocket and offering
    her husband money. If I did so I&rsquo;d probably be shown the shortest track
    to the boundary, and so be let down lightly. And, in the evening, they would
    sit down, in their dusty rags, to their meal of damper and meat, or damper
    and tea &mdash; and brood over a new wrong, an unexpected insult.</p>
  <p>No! The Bush people must be helped wholesale &mdash; by the Government,
    by the public, by the people. Every spare penny should be spent on water
    conservation and irrigation, in sinking tanks and putting down bores, in
    locking out thousands and thousands of miles of rivers &mdash; almost at
    sea level &mdash;  where oceans of water waste away after each flood time.
    To attend to these things is a national work, for the benefit of the whole
    nation; to neglect them is a national crime &mdash; it is suicidal.</p>
  <p>The big squatter, bank, or company, with many stations, have a margin for
    drought losses. There may be rain on one run to make up for the losses through
    drought on another; and one good season often makes up for several bad ones.
    It is the small squatter, cockatoo, selector, or farmer who suffers so cruelly,
    and, in time of drought, they should not be called upon to pay an instalment
    of one penny an acre on their barren lands. I know how they slave and how
    they suffer.</p>
  <p>I was &ldquo;brought up&rdquo; well &ldquo;inside&rdquo; in &ldquo;good
    country&rdquo;, yet the scrub round our selection was dotted with dusty little
    patches, with the remains of a fence, a heap of chimney stones, and the ruins
    of a hut &mdash; all that was left of twenty, thirty, forty years of white
    slavery through blazing droughts.</p>
  <p>I like living illustrations. Take our own few neighbours, for instance.
    There was C&mdash;. He alone first, and later on he and his wife &mdash; and
    later on he and his boys and girls &mdash; bullocked for years, digging the
    flinty stumps and trees out of the soil that was almost as flinty, &rsquo;ploughing
    the hard ground. I&rsquo;ve seen some of it blown up with blasting powder
    before the heavy, strong bullock-plough could make an impression there; trenching
    it for an orchard and vineyard, and carting every shovelful of manure they
    could get from the stables of the nearest town. He took fencing and tank-sinking
    contracts between whiles, and went out with his boys to make flour, meat,
    tea, and sugar for the family. And they worked like slaves. You don&rsquo;t
    know how they work in the Bush. The great drought of the early eighties ruined
    them &mdash; the same that burnt us off our selection. The last time I saw
    old C&mdash; he was doing pick-and-shovel work at Prospect &mdash; but later
    on, I believe, he was promoted to the charge of a horse and dray. His old
    wife was taking in washing in Sydney.</p>
  <p>These selections were shoved back in stony, scrubby, barren ridges, while
    thousands of acres of good land were wanted for sheep, or lying idle as old
    land grants. But that&rsquo;s another question.</p>
  <p>During the same drought W&mdash;, the squatter, was driven to the railway
    line, on his way to a Sydney asylum, handcuffed between two policemen. He
    was raving mad.</p>
  <p>And the B&mdash;s. They were the big people there in my time. They had a
    brick house and a fine vineyard, orchard, and farm. In the old days the old
    man and his wife worked on stations round, and took up a bit of land and
    built a humpy there, working nights and Sundays, and begged &ldquo;slips&rdquo;  and
    planted fruit trees. In later years they slaved, men, women, and children,
    till the eldest daughter looked as old as her mother, and the eldest son
    was a stoop-shouldered old man at 30. The old man worked until he died, and
    the place began to look beautiful. One season they had to scrape the soil
    away from the roots of every vine of a big new vineyard, and collect the
    grubs that were destroying the vines; also to treat the fruit trees for a
    blight. But these are little things in Australian farming. Then, a succession
    of droughts, and then the dread pleuro pneumonia in the drought. They had
    fifteen milkers down with it one morning and lost most of them. Then, at
    last, a terrific hailstorm that stripped the great vineyard of ripening grapes.
    The eldest son was going to be married that year, &ldquo;after wine-making&rdquo;.
    He is working for wages on a station now. The rest of the family are scattered,
    and the bank has taken over the old farm. And so the white slavery of more
    than half a century of one family, who bullocked at it as only Germans will.
    The useless sacrifice of the youth, beauty, strength, and happiness of two
    generations. It is the awful waste of strong, brave lives and long years
    of toil that appals me.</p>
  <p>There was poor Harry S&mdash;, our nearest neighbour, on a small selection,
    who worked like the rest. They were very poor &mdash; they often lived and
    grafted on damper, tea, and sugar. He strained himself lifting logs in a
    paddock he was clearing. I saw him carried home one day on a sheet of bark,
    with his face covered. There&rsquo;s a little weazened old woman out there
    who has been &ldquo;queer in her head&rdquo; ever since her husband was carried
    home dead. She has bad turns sometimes, and then she keeps crying out: &ldquo;Oh,
    my dear, good, kind husband! He&rsquo;s not dead! He can&rsquo;t be dead!
    It&rsquo;s a lie they&rsquo;re tellin&rsquo; me! Oh! why did you tell me
    sich a wicked lie?&rdquo; and so on, over and over again while the fit lasts.</p>
  <p>There was &ldquo;Hard R&mdash;&rdquo;, the selector, who, one blazing day,
    when he thought he was alone, fell on his knees behind a stump, out of sight
    of the house, and prayed for rain as perhaps man never prayed before. But
    they have little time for praying out there. They must work on holidays and
    Sundays in the drought, carting water, lifting weak cattle, and dragging
    them out of mud-holes, cutting down creek-oak and native apple tree for them
    to eat, burning the carcases, and fighting bush fires. It is backbreaking,
    heartbreaking work. The young men often rise earliest and work hardest on
    their wedding days.</p>
  <p>There was a woman, a selector&rsquo;s wife, a big, strong, intelligent woman,
    who had new ideas about farming, and wanted to break away from the old rule-of-thumb
    system. She had thought out a pretty name for the place when it should be
    a farm with a brick house, with trees and flowers and vines round it. The
    ground was about the poorest in the district and the selector carted manure
    to it. He was a little nuggety Norwegian, an educated man in his country
    and an intelligent man. He had the reputation of being the honestest and
    hardest-working man in the district, as well as one of the strongest. He
    worked round about, carpentering, bricklaying, etc., to make money to keep
    the family and pay up the instalments on the selections, and to spend on
    the land; and he cleared it and fenced it, and ploughed it between whiles,
    and often dug out flinty stumps and &ldquo;burnt off&rdquo; or dug in the
    dam at night after a long, hard day&rsquo;s work in the nearest town. They
    used to say he never rested.</p>
  <p>One year she persuaded him to save and buy up all the wheaten chaff he could
    get, and mostly on that she kept the milking cows alive through the terrible
    drought. Then came that dread cattle disease, and they died one after the
    other. She doctored them herself while he was away. The eldest son, a delicate
    boy, was often sick while bleeding the cattle, and she had to do it herself.
    Several days passed without a fresh case, and she began to hope; several
    more days, and she rejoiced. Then, in the morning came the children running
    with the news that there was another cow down &mdash; the best milker. Then
    the woman broke down. She sat on a log, her hands lying hopelessly and helplessly
    on her knees, and stared &mdash; just stared with haggard, hopeless, wide-opened
    eyes &mdash; out over the blazing ruin and desolation that was round the
    home that was never named. The picture is before me yet &mdash; I wish I
    could paint it. The cows and steers died till all were gone, and there was
    hot, heavy work to burn the carcases where firewood was scarce.</p>
  <p>The selector took another contract, dam-sinking this time, and worked harder
    than he had ever done before, to make money to buy more cows. But one day
    he &ldquo;felt very queer&rdquo;, and started home to his camp: halfway he
    felt worse and began to run. He sat down on a stool with his back to the
    wall of the hut and died.</p>
  <p>I saw him when he was dead. The doctor said it was something of the heart
    and an old thing. Some said it was the only time they ever saw him rest.
    I thought that the vertical knit in his forehead was deeper than it had been
    in life, and that he looked as though he were in pain; but they said that
    that was on account of &nbsp;the post-mortem. And, as I watched &mdash; it
    might have been because of the dry mist that came before my eyes &mdash;  I
    fancied that his horny, knotted hands seemed to work as I had seen them work
    while he slept &mdash; as though grasping the handle of an axe or a pick.
    Death couldn&rsquo;t whiten nor smooth the scarred, knotted fingers, nor
    mend the twisted, broken nails.</p>
  <p>Burials are hurried in the drought. The clay sods on the grave begin to
    whiten in the fierce heat as the mourners turn away. And, as I turned away
    from his grave I wished that I could write, or paint, or do something to
    help these people &mdash; my Bush people &mdash; for he was my father.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; 7 July 1910</i></p>
  <p>Bermagui, where the mystery was. Sunset, and a sad, old mysterious bright
    gold-to-dull copper one. Red flag with broad white cross; gloomy and half
    fearful, half threatening in sunset glare.</p>
  <p>Sort of jumbled curve of bay &mdash; sand, rotten rock and beach scrub and
    tussock. As if it were meant to be a clean curve with white sand. But jutting
    out of rotting earth and sand and bastard rock &mdash; that were not &ldquo;points&rdquo;,
    nor anything else &mdash; were left, mixed up with scraggy bush and scrub
    and coarse tufts that Nature forgot, or hadn&rsquo;t time to shove away and
    tidy up. Scene started in a hurry, left half finished and forgotten. Blue
    hill or bastard mountain to the west, running down to pygmy peak at the end
    of it. Mount Dromedary &mdash; and looks like it. Tired, sulky, obstinate
    old Dromedary in the dusk, shutting out daylight. Point same rotten clay
    or rock tipped with a fringe of bastard, scraggy, dead trees. Stacks of sleepers,
    sleepers and sawn timber along darkening clay road. Jumble of sand, and mongrel
    scrub, and tussock, and Beach Hotel. Jumble of weatherboard shanties. All
    seem to face sunset with guilty, glazed and gleaming eyes turned towards
    where, far out at the end of the mountain, Lamont Young&rsquo;s party were
    lost &mdash; or not lost &mdash; nearly thirty years ago. One house, back
    behind clumps of decent trees to the left, with only one guilty, glassy,
    brassy eye visible from deck. Showing well above jumble of houses on hill
    at the back, one small, oblong, weatherboard, bare, verandah-less &ldquo;cottage&rdquo;,
    with two eyes more glazy, more glaring, more blazing and guiltier than all
    the rest, against sunset.</p>
  <p>Darkness falls. Flares glaring on wharf and deck. Long sawn timber swung
    aboard and below with amazing clumsiness and carelessness. Hurry, hurry,
    hurry. Snatching hatfuls of cargo from every little port. Too lightly laden.
    Chancing it and running across from Mainland and Tasmania over perhaps the
    most dangerous seas in the world, in little more than ballast. I <i>know </i>it
    and have known it for many years. Way back in Dann&rsquo;s time, Clark Russel
    speaks of it. Rotten ships started off round the world too deeply laden.
    Down here, in Lawson&rsquo;s time, coffin ships from Newcastle and Sydney
    have fallen into a trough and through the bottom, like a kettle filled with
    bullets. And men drowned like rats in same kettle with lid cramped on. Now
    it&rsquo;s all haste &mdash; razor-edged competition and greed. I&rsquo;ve
    been round the Cape, from Durban to Sydney, where the <i>Waratah </i>was
    lost, and I know.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d rather be in one of our little Mallacoota or Cunningham cutters,
    with a comfortable bellyful of cargo, off Gabo, in a sea, than in some of
    our long, high, narrow, top-heavy, too-lightly-laden, speed-greedy liners,
    in the long, greasy, devilish beam roll. The little cutter sits upright,
    anyway, and climbs like a cat. Think of the liner turned turtle! Hundreds &mdash; men,
    women, children, lads and lasses &mdash; trapped, helpless; the most horrible
    death you could imagine at sea. When she swamps, there&rsquo;s light, at
    least, to the last, and a chance for it.</p>
  <p>But we are sketching Bermagui. Chaff goes ashore. (Points and trees dark
    and dreary.) More cheese comes on board. Cheese, butter, eggs, sawn timber,
    calves, pigs, and sleepers, and in the season, <i>wool! </i>We can&rsquo;t
    get away from wool. Pigs and calves slung aboard anyhow.</p>
  <p>But let us get out of this.</p>
  <p>Light on Montague Island like star in the east. Moonlight.</p>
  <p>Passed Ulladulla in my sleep; but it sounds like cheese, butter, eggs, calves,
    pigs, pumpkins, and, in the season, wool. Same as Cunnamulla, in Queensland,
    always suggests mashed pumpkin or pumpkin pies to me.</p>
  <p>Hatches left off, with chain round, to give air to stock. Roaring of young
    bulls, blowing of calves, grunting and squealing of pigs in cattle hold &mdash;  and
    ditto in saloon smoking-room, for they&rsquo;re drinking a bit. If we only
    had a donkey, and a sheep or two, and a goat, we&rsquo;d be complete forward.
    Sailor says there&rsquo;s queer cattle in the saloon sometimes.</p>
  <p>Roused by strange noise just as I was dozing off. It was the fore-cabin
    steward with the jim-jams in his sleep. Most uncanny sounds I ever heard.</p>
  <p>Morning bright and glorious. Off Port Hacking. Rockdale over beyond showing
    the cliffs. Cutter between the Heads. Sails of fishing boats &mdash; dark
    brown, clay-coloured, light brown with touch of yellow, yellowish grey, plain
    grey, tawny and almost black. The heads at nine o&rsquo;clock.</p>
  <p>That is Australia. No meadows and fields showing fair down to the sea, nor
    aught, as in other lands, to hint of the great wealth of riches within her.
    Shelving rock coast, capped with hopeless and forbidding, dry coastal scrub &mdash;  you&rsquo;d

    <b>The Last Shaft In Log Paddock</b></h2>
  <p align="center"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; 3 June 1915</i></p>
  <p>It is another rainy day. Rainy days seem to be growing more frequent of
    late &mdash; I wish I&rsquo;d saved up for some of them. But it&rsquo;s much
    too far along towards the end of Elder Man&rsquo;s Lane to hope to save up
    a decent sum for the dreary, dry, sapped and ring-barked Flat of Old Age.</p>
  <p>Elder Man&rsquo;s Lane looks a long lane before you come to it, but when
    you reach it you seem to be through it very quickly &mdash; sometimes. It&rsquo;s
    where your hair gets like the dead trees on Ring-barked Flat &mdash; and
    sometimes your heart&rsquo;s as hard. But enough of that! There&rsquo;s such
    a thing as a green old age, I suppose. I <i>know </i>there&rsquo;s such a
    thing as a green youth. But we&rsquo;ll leave all that out.</p>
  <p>Elder Man&rsquo;s Lane has brought me round to the home of my boyhood, some
    two hundred miles west and north of Sydney. Here, in the Old Place, the west
    was always where the east is in any other place. It seems so still. But,
    to me, things have always been more or less back-to-front or the-other-way-about.
    The Mudgee line always seemed to branch off to the south, instead of to the
    north-west at Wallerawang Junction, and <i>vice versa </i>coming down. But,
    then, I&rsquo;ve always passed the Junction in the night, and that might
    have something to do with it. (There&rsquo;s no day &ldquo;passenger&rdquo; on
    the Mudgee line, except at holiday time; so the ordinary passenger misses
    some of the grandest scenery in Australia. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to
    do with it.)</p>
  <p>Anyway, the Old Place always seemed vague, and vaguely far off, like the
    Sunset Islands, when we were away from it &mdash; as other places were when
    we were at home &mdash; and the afterglow from sunset glares and fades just
    as ghostly as it did when we used to reckon that that same sun (which seems
    to set in an east where the west ought to be) went down behind the low ridges
    across the Cudgegong River, and then travelled all round behind the Mudgee
    Hills and rose again behind <i>our </i>hills. It took him all night to go
    round, we reckoned. He seemed to rise just back of our hills, and it was
    hot enough in the droughts of the early eighties for that to be so.</p>
  <p>So I, John Lawrence, sit in the House that Father Built, and write painfully
    in the same room, at the same table, in the same schoolboy hand that I started
    to &ldquo;form&rdquo; here nearly forty years ago. And with much the same
    orthography and grammar.</p>
  <p>I think we&rsquo;ll send the Other Self, &ldquo;John Lawrence&rdquo;, back
    to Sydney. He&rsquo;s out of place here and is restless and depressed and
    homesick; and no wonder. The old place is very dark today, and the old tree-ivy
    in front makes it darker still. We&rsquo;ll send John back down along the
    lines, and across to North Sydney by the Horse Punt, where, no doubt, his
    casual friend, Benno, will be wondering what became of that writin&rsquo; bloke.
    So long, Jack! Meet you down below.</p>
  <p>So I, Henry Hertzberg Larsen, sit in the house my father built.</p>
  <p>The scene is little changed, Mary. At least, it is little changed until
    you look into it. It&rsquo;s something like an author reading his own proofs;
    he reads on all right for a while, and then, no matter how he tries to concentrate,
    he begins to read as he wrote the thing, or as it ought to be; and not as
    the comps, think it ought to be.</p>
  <p>But later on, I noticed that &ldquo;our hill&rdquo; &mdash; &ldquo;The box-covered
    ridge where the five-corners grew&rdquo; &mdash; has become a pine ridge.
    There were only three tall pines on the peak above the saddle in my time,
    but these had been cut down for timber. I noticed no change on the last visit,
    twenty years ago; but successive ring-barkers, woudcarters and bushfires
    had cleared most of the box scrub away, and given the young pines a chance.
    And, lo! a pine ridge against sunrise where white box was yesterday. It would
    look more fitting against sunset. But then, the sunset is turned round here,
    as I said before.</p>
  <p>All the old people seem alive, except my father and one or two mates of
    his, who happened to be of regular and steady habits. We buried my father
    in another place, some twenty-five years ago, and the rest of the family
    have long left the old home; so it doesn&rsquo;t seem as haunted as it otherwise
    might have been. There was a fair-headed, blue-eyed Norwegian sister of mine,
    buried over there under the darkening Mudgee Hills, who might have helped
    to make my life very different: but &mdash; damn these dark, rainy days!</p>
  <p>Darkness and rain. And, behind the ridge, the weird gullies of the past,
    the home of many tragedies, with their flattened waste-heaps &mdash; ghostly
    even in daylight, amongst saplings that have grown to trees &mdash; lying
    like the graves of diggers&rsquo; hopes. The gullies with their sordid and
    ghastly tragedies, strangely connected nearly always with mysterious fossicking
    mates; a hut, a bunk, a dead body and a shot-gun.</p>
  <p>I remember the last in my time. An acquaintance came down, as was customary
    with him, to have a yarn with one of the old mates on Sunday morning. He
    knocked, and called, and then pushed open the door of the hut. The old fossicker
    was lying with his face towards the wall, the gun in the bunk beside him.
    He had shot himself, or had been shot, on the previous Friday. His fossicking
    mate was drinking in town. He swore that he had not gone up that gully with
    his mate on Friday night, but had turned back for more drink and had slept
    on the road. There was a story, strangely familiar to me, that these two
    had been mates in Queensland; that one had committed a murder there, and
    the dead man knew it; that they had quarrelled on their way home from a spree
    in town that night, and one had threatened to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; on the
    other. A girl, belonging to a family at the foot of the gully, said that
    she heard the two quarrelling as they went up the gully. But, then, girls &mdash; and
    women, too &mdash; will say strange things. And for no apparent reason on
    God&rsquo;s earth &mdash; things that hang men or send them to gaol for life.
    Anyway, the other mate got off. But angry men burnt that hut to the last
    stick, and scattered the ashes. I was shown the place yesterday, and bare
    and ghostly, even ghastly, it looked among the saplings on a dull day. I
    wonder what it would look like in the twilight of a fine day &mdash; or by
    moonlight? Or in the ghostly Bush daybreak? Children avoid it going home
    from school, just as <i>we </i>avoided the sites of other huts.</p>
  <p>(Don&rsquo;t bother, I&rsquo;m coming to the &ldquo;Last Shaft in Log Paddock&rdquo; presently.
    We&rsquo;ll all come to the last shaft soon enough.)</p>
  <p>These two old fossickers were the last in Sapling and Golden Gullies. Legend
    says a similar tragedy was connected with the first two prospecting mates,
    long ago, before the Rush.</p>
  <p>Then there was the strange case of old &ldquo;Vat-you-Blease&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Sich-a-Vay&rdquo;,
    the German. He got his early nicknames from expressions of his. They called
    him a &ldquo;Dutchman&rdquo;, so most likely he wasn&rsquo;t; and he wasn&rsquo;t
    old &mdash; just about midway in Elder Man&rsquo;s Lane.</p>
  <p>Now, this place used to be called &ldquo;Pipeclay&rdquo;, on account of
    the quantity of that stuff brought up from below. There were great waste
    heaps of it on the flat. But they&rsquo;re all gone now, with the tailings
    and gravel, to make roads or something. On Specimen Flat, at the foot of
    Golden Gully, they brought up heaps of stuff that felt fine and silky, like
    pipeclay; but <i>it </i>was black, of the blue-blackest &mdash; a grass-killing
    stuff when it rained and the clay &ldquo;ran&rdquo;. Old diggers used to
    have a great prejudice against it; but &ldquo;Vat-you-Blease&rdquo; had great
    faith in it. He called it &ldquo;plack vitevash&rdquo;. And so he himself
    came to be &ldquo;Black Vitevash&rdquo; or, as the younger folk put it, &ldquo;Old
    Black Vitevash&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Well, one day, &ldquo;Black Vitevash&rdquo; was missing. He wasn&rsquo;t
    missing long, for he was a cheerful soul and popular. It was on a Monday
    morning, and he hadn&rsquo;t turned up anywhere over Sunday. His bed was
    made up on the stretcher, almost hospital fashion. Everything was neat and
    tidy. The tent had been swept, too, and the space before it. The frying-pan
    was scoured and hanging on the nail on its accustomed sapling. The little
    camp-oven was clean. His mullocky moleskins had been hung out to dry, and
    the clay had caked, so that it could be beaten off. He had, evidently, had
    the digger&rsquo;s usual Saturday afternoon cleanup. A much-patched shirt,
    washed and folded, lay on the bunk. His heavy clay-clogged bluchers stood
    outside the tent flap. But the rough serge Sunday suit and everything else
    in the shape of clothing were gone. And &ldquo;Black Vitevash&rdquo; was
    gone too. He&rsquo;s been gone for nearly five years. The police were out
    and searched all the old digger holes; and parties were on the ridges and
    in the scrub for days. Some kept up the search for weeks. But they found
    no &ldquo;Black Vitevash&rdquo; &mdash; except the clay.</p>
  <p>Maybe in town he had got important news from &ldquo;Home&rdquo; or somewhere,
    and, with no time to say good-bye to anybody, had slipped into the train
    unnoticed. Maybe he had found a nugget, or got a lot of coarse gold in some
    forgotten &ldquo;wash&rdquo;. Maybe anything. Maybe he was a hunted man.
    Maybe he&rsquo;s a happy man now in Christiana, Stockholm or Helsingfors.
    And maybe he&rsquo;s tramping or sailing, somewhere in the world, broken-hearted
    and grey because of the Girl Who Couldn&rsquo;t Wait. She was well known
    to many diggers.</p>
  <p>And that&rsquo;s the tale of the &ldquo;Fairy Fossicker&rdquo;. The children
    always found lollies at &ldquo;Black Vitevash&rsquo;s&rdquo; camp after his
    fortnightly visit to the township; and, somehow, they don&rsquo;t avoid <i>that </i>site.
    They don&rsquo;t mind going past <i>there </i>in the dusk. They&rsquo;ll
    even play round it in the moonlight. There&rsquo;s a ring amongst the saplings
    that&rsquo;s been there since I can remember. Some said a travelling circus
    made it in the hard ground. Some say it is because of a peculiar ring of
    subsoil formation (maybe black whitewash) that makes the grass above it grow
    a different colour. But the children don&rsquo;t believe these things. The
    Fairies made it.</p>
  <p>And, to finish with a rather pleasant story, yet with a sort of sadness
    about it. There were two old diggers, named Frank and George Dale. Not only
    brothers, but mates. They had come out together as young men, and had knocked
    about the diggings for many years. And whatever romance they left behind
    them stayed there. They had a neat bark hut opposite where I am writing now,
    in Log Paddock. They fossicked round and did odd bush-carpentering and fencing
    jobs to get the wherewithal to prospect. When they had made a few pounds
    they &ldquo;put down a shaft&rdquo;. I knew them as long as I can remember.
    They simply drifted into my childhood like something that had been there
    all the time; and they faded out of my later, wandering years like something
    that had never been.</p>
  <p>But Frank is very close to me to-night. George was a personality in the
    background.</p>
  <p>Every Saturday, digger-like, they&rsquo;d knock off at one o&rsquo;clock,
    and go down to the creek and wash their clothes; to appear on Sunday afternoon
    in clean shirts and moles, with fresh spotted handkerchiefs round their necks.
    And every Sunday, between twelve and one, we boys would go across to the
    hut, for Frank could bake a joint as it should be baked, with the best Yorkshire
    pudding I ever tasted, coiled like a roly-poly round the &ldquo;roast&rdquo; in
    the camp-oven, and done just a nice yellow-brown. Frank; by the way, had
    a face whereof the lower part always smiled, whether he felt that way or
    not. So they lived their harmless, useful lives, helping neighbours in sickness
    and trouble, and going on their harmless, brotherly little periodical sprees,
    till at last, having saved a few pounds, they put down a shaft in McDonald&rsquo;s
    paddock; and there they struck their Golden Hole &mdash; several hundred
    pounds. In the first flush of victory, of course, they were &ldquo;Going
    Home&rdquo; at last; and then they suddenly found themselves too old. At
    least, it was discovered that George was; in fact, he gave <i>his </i>share
    to another old mate, and knocked off for good before the gold was worked
    out.</p>
  <p>Then the two brothers shifted over to Budgee-Budgee, and built the neatest
    of all their huts there, in a pleasant spot near a spring, and made a garden.
    And each made a will in favour of the other; the property of the one who
    died last to go to a younger brother &mdash; or was it a younger sister?
    Something of that sort, in England. They went to the Mudgee Hospital together
    at last &mdash; the ultimate result of fighting the water in many wet claims.
    There George died. And Frank died later on on the same day. So they went
    Home, and were buried in the new cemetery near the Racecourse, amongst others
    of the last of the old diggers. The gold that it had taken a lifetime (and
    God knows how many buried hopes) to win, went to some stodgy, retired tradesman
    in England, who had faint recollection of Frank or &ldquo;Jarge&rdquo; as
    went &ldquo;abrard&rdquo; &mdash; somebody who didn&rsquo;t know how to use
    money, and couldn&rsquo;t tell the map of Australia from a dog&rsquo;s hind
    leg.</p>
  <p>I shall have to leave The Last Shaft in Log Paddock to another story, after
    all.</p>

    <b>The Last Shaft</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; 9 December 1915</i></p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t feel lonely now as I sit writing by night in the &ldquo;front
    room&rdquo; of the old home by Log Paddock. I used to feel very, very lonely
    here as a boy, thirty-odd years ago, when they were all alive and around
    me. The Bush seemed haunted then by a Future, which is dead. I&rsquo;ve got
    in touch with the world since that time. Besides, two old digger-mates, Bill
    Payne and Harry McDermott, who have batched in the old house for years, are
    smoking their pipes in reflective silence, one on each side of the big kitchen
    fireplace, after a hard day&rsquo;s battling with the water in a wet shaft
    (thinly disguised as a contract well) that they are trying to bottom at the
    other end of Log Paddock. (This end has been &ldquo;this end&rdquo; from
    time immemorial.) </p>
  <p>Moreover, &ldquo;Young Jack&rdquo; McDermott &mdash; he&rsquo;s about thirty-three &mdash; will
    be home soon from an Irish-German wedding down at M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s farm,
    with a ridiculous and grossly-exaggerated account of the whole business,
    and a warmly-coloured and highly-improper description of the young couple&rsquo;s
    immediate future. They have to be all night in the train in wintry weather.
    Also, he&rsquo;ll bring a bottle of good Weinsberg port-wine for me from
    a vineyard across &ldquo;the crick&rdquo;. </p>
  <p>Jack has come home with a mate of German descent; and I can hear him taking
    his father to task about the way the Old Man brought him up. Jack has the
    same affection and regard for his father as Benno had for his &ldquo;Old  &rsquo;Uns&rdquo;;
    but Jack has a different way of showing it. However, he gets little change
    from the Old Man. </p>
  <p>Near midnight. The rain has cleared away, and it is bright moonlight. Log
    Paddock, opposite &mdash; which isn&rsquo;t a log paddock, and hasn&rsquo;t
    been one since the writer&rsquo;s childhood &mdash; looks strangely open.
    I had forgotten to notice that the bush has been cleared away (for the second
    time since convict days), and only a few shade trees left for the immortal
    Cow. For this, from being first a farming and vine-growing, then a mining,
    and, next, a wheat district, has become mostly cow-cocky. This will help
    you to understand some things. </p>
  <p>The log fence &mdash; I remember parts of it &mdash; was composed of two
    long logs laid side by side on the ground, with chocks across, and other
    two logs on top of them, and so on. There isn&rsquo;t a log of it left now,
    and hasn&rsquo;t been for many a long year. They all went for timbering shafts,
    for post-and-rail fences and firewood. Then there was a stout two-rail fence &mdash; I
    saw it put up. Now that is gone, and Log Paddock is surrounded by the eternal
    wire-netting, with two barbed wires on top. For Bunny had triumphed here.
    But barbed wire was a blessed relief from the eternal, bullocking &ldquo;billeting&rdquo;.
    Every curse brings an antidotal blessing. And poor people make a living out
    of the rabbits. At least, they are locally and tolerantly referred to as &ldquo;the
    poor people&rdquo;. Some of the &ldquo;poor&rdquo;  people average &pound;4
    a week, and over. My philanthropic friend, whose heart bleeds for the rabbiter,
    averages thirty shillings; and he averages it under protest.</p>
  <p>Talking of fences. I&rsquo;m always expecting a fence where there&rsquo;s
    none now. Round the old house is a very old two-rail, and along the road
    frontage a barbed wire with an old post here and there mortised for two rails;
    sometimes several of these posts in a row &mdash; as in front of the house.
    They seem, in the moonlight, like passing ghosts that pause momentarily and
    stare. I didn&rsquo;t know why they did that to me until it struck me that
    they were the remains of a fence that I had put up, as a boy, more than thirty
    years ago. But good timber had long been scarce, even then, and the post
    and rails had belonged to another fence.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d like to have a portrait of that boy as he was then. Those old
    grey posts haunt me in their old grey way, with thoughts and fancies of another
    boy whom I saw recently in Sydney. An old grey aunt said that this young
    fellow was the dead spit of me as I was at his age. She said that the likeness
    was so startling that he gave her quite a shock at first sight. She thought
    she&rsquo;d gone back thirty years &mdash; or I&rsquo;d come on. He is my
    son Jim.</p>
  <p>(Never mind. We&rsquo;re coming to &ldquo;The Last Shaft in Log Paddock&rdquo; soon.)</p>
  <p>Dawn breaking above Golden Gully. Then, slowly, the sunrise over old Mount
    Buckaroo purples all along the Mudgee Hills. The old German vineyards are
    flushed above the slopes beyond the dark-green she-oaks across Pipeclay Creek.
    But they are greatly changed. They have long got away from the old, cast-iron,
    immigrant German idea that handicapped two generations &mdash; the immigrant
    German generation and the first Australian-Germans, the fixed idea, as an
    idea can only be fixed in Teuton minds, that vines would grow nowhere but
    on a sunny slope. Nowadays the best are grown on the levels above and some
    even on the creek flats. The slopes from which the old, old vines were uprooted,
    are bare and &ldquo;scalded&rdquo;, and will probably grow nothing for years.
    Very modern houses and cellars have taken the places of the old, German,
    snake-infested ones. They say that snakes have grown scarce in the district.
    Perhaps Laughing Jack could explain, since he&rsquo;s been protected. But
    snakes come out of some of those cellars yet. I know because I&rsquo;ve been
    bitten by one.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the enlarged portrait of a young man on the wall, amongst
    old prints that used to belong to us. A young man with a full face, roguish
    eyes and a dark moustache rather pointed and turned up at the corners. I
    knew him well. He was full of whimsical humour and practical jokes of a harmless
    sort. He first appeared, in my boyish memory, at the back door while the
    Chieftainess was entertaining a German lady-friend of the old school and
    a severe-looking schoolmistress &mdash; childless, and of another old school.
    He was then sinking a shaft with a party, of whom my father was one, on the
    original two-acre freehold, just behind the house. His name was Harry McDermott.</p>
  <p>He married and came with his young wife to live in the old house the day
    we were leaving.</p>
  <p>On my last visit, twenty-odd years ago, he was little changed. (On that
    occasion, by the way, I took his two boys up to Con O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s
    to buy lollies. One of the boys was Jack.) Harry was expecting to strike
    it rich in a shaft in Log Paddock. He said at the dinner-table that if I,
    in my travels abroad, should happen to come across a party of three &mdash; a
    jolly, good-looking fellow like himself; a sour, discontented, jealous-looking
    old woman; and a pretty, soulful, golden-haired, happy young woman &mdash; I&rsquo;d
    know at once that it was him and his wife and the children&rsquo;s governess,
    and that he&rsquo;d struck his golden hole at last and was making a grand
    tour of the world.</p>
  <p>Out in the kitchen an old man is getting an early breakfast ready at the
    big, open fireplace. At least, he has the appearance of an old man. His hair &mdash; what
    is left of it &mdash; is as white as his beard. He is bent, and, when he
    walks, his legs, seen from the rear, are shrunken and &ldquo;gone&rdquo;.
    His eyelids have dropped and his eyes are half-shut most of the time. He
    seldom smiles, and only gives a grunt of a laugh now and again; but in one
    of the few brighter moments he opens his eyes, and a ghost of the old whimsical
    manner comes back. For <i>his </i>name is Harry McDermott. (The Last Shaft
    is very near now.)</p>
  <p>He lost his wife ten years ago, and he and his mate have batched in the
    old house nearly ever since. His children have grown up and drifted off.
    All except &ldquo;Young Jack&rdquo;. Everything in the old home is almost
    as the wife and mother left it &mdash; save, of course, in the matter of
    window curtains and little woman&rsquo;s things like chat. The front bedroom
    is never used. He sleeps on a bunk in the kitchen, and his mate and Jack
    in the &ldquo;boys&rsquo; room&rdquo; between. (I used to be one of &ldquo;the
    boys&rdquo;.) The big kitchen dresser is as it was always kept clean and
    tidy, as only old diggers amongst landsmen keep things. Of the astonishingly
    complete crockery outfit scarce a dish has been broken.</p>
  <p>Harry McDermott and his mate, Billy Payne, live by well-sinking and prospecting
    and getting a bit of gold now and then. But the shallows and the dry ground
    have long been worked out; for nearly all Log Paddock, when you get down
    a little, is a subterranean lake. They are sinking a well for a cow-cocky
    amongst the ancient workings at the upper end of Log Paddock &mdash; with
    an eye to a  &ldquo;bit o&rsquo; gold&rdquo; at the &ldquo;bottom&rdquo;,
    if they can reach it. People say they shall never bottom that shaft &mdash; or
    well, if you like it better. But they sink in the mullock, and they bail
    and timber, battling bravely down. It is sawn slabs now instead of split,
    with cleats at the corners instead of pegs. It looks as neat as if the shaft
    were bricked. But they can&rsquo;t keep the water out. There was a little
    water &ldquo;follerin&rsquo; &rsquo;em down&rdquo; last week. There&rsquo;s
    6ft now. It&rsquo;s no use bailing on Sunday, as of old; for the same depth
    will be there on Monday morning.</p>
  <p>Young Jack is going to &ldquo;knock off for a week&rdquo; (he&rsquo;s fencing)
    and give them a hand to help bottom that shaft. But he knows the case is
    hopeless. It would need a steam-pump, and all the gold they are likely to
    get wouldn&rsquo;t pay for the engine oil. Oh, the lifelong faith of the
    gold-digger!</p>
  <p>Billy starts off first in the morning, while Harry cuts the dinner and puts
    it in the tucker-bag. Then Harry starts, with the dog after him. Going up
    the road, there is always from a quarter to half a mile between the mates.
    And in like manner shall they come home in the evening. Only then the dog
    will be in the lead. They were known to walk together once &mdash; when there
    was trouble at home. &Iota; wonder if they&rsquo;ll walk home together if
    they strike gold? They&rsquo;re about the only two old professional diggers
    left in the district.</p>
  <p>And they&rsquo;ll stick to that shaft, and dig out the mullock, and put
    in the slabs, and fight the water as sailors fight it in the hold of a stricken
    ship. For they are fighting for something which is dearer to an old digger
    than his life &mdash; they are fighting for Independence in their old age!
    No old digger looks forward to living with a married son or daughter in the
    city &mdash; or with a daughter-in-law or son-in-law &mdash; when he is &ldquo;worked
    out&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>And &Iota;&rsquo;ll always have a vision of an old grey digger, at the bottom
    of a wet shaft, working by the dim light of the candle in its socket stuck
    in the side &mdash; working at the slabs <i>in his spectacles! </i>Harry
    McDermott&rsquo;s eyes have failed him.</p>
  <p>Now, I suppose you&rsquo;ve already forgotten the jolly young digger &mdash; and
    the wife &mdash; and the governess?</p>
  <p align="center">* * *&nbsp; * * * * * *</p>
  <p>So we old writers go timbering up the walls of our ruined lives, and sinking
    through the mullock of the Present, and bailing out, and delving in the drift
    and the wash for the gold of human nature and the best part of the Past.

  <p align="center"><b>The End Of Log Paddock</b></p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; 6 March 1916</i></p>
  <p>Some time back I wrote that Cowcockyism and Cow were the end of Log Paddock,
    the District and My Own People, but I know now that they weren&rsquo;t. For
    the other Sunday I read that Log Paddock had been leased by a syndicate and
    was to be turned into a stud farm, and &ldquo;it was hoped it would give
    a great impetus to racing in the Mudgee district&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>They have thought and dreamed and talked of and bred and trained horses
    for little else but racing in the Mudgee district for as far back as my memory
    goes, and for the last ten or twenty years the younger men have thought and
    dreamed and talked of <i>nothing </i>else &mdash;  unless it be girls and
    dancing. And in other districts as well, I suppose. Draught and other useful
    horses had to come by chance &mdash; and take their chance. Racehorses, with
    their clothes, were ever on the roads and are ever on the trains. They&rsquo;re
    amongst the earliest memories of my childhood. So I don&rsquo;t see what &ldquo;impetus&rdquo; racing
    needs in the Mudgee district. Nearly every boy&rsquo;s ambition was to be
    a jockey, when it wasn&rsquo;t to be a mounted trooper &mdash; or a bushranger.
    Jockey came first.</p>
  <p>Opposite Log Paddock and across the &ldquo;Guv&rsquo;mint Road&rdquo; stands
    what used to be &ldquo;Our Hill&rdquo;, with slopes or &ldquo;sidings&rdquo; above
    the frost-line in the severest winter, and nooks or &ldquo;pockets&rdquo; which
    were always warm in the sharpest weather; where the cows used to go to calve,
    and the cattle camped at nights when it was bitter cold on the flats. I suppose
    the old selection will be part of the stud farm, and stables built up there
    for brood mares &mdash; for warmth in winter and coolness in summer. And
    the old house (where the local papers say I was born, but I wasn&rsquo;t) &mdash; where
    we fought drought and ruin and death for so many years &mdash;  will be a
    camp for the cigarette-smoking, spitting weeds they call jockeys and trainers.</p>
  <p>I was never on the sacred soil of a racecourse in my life &mdash; except
    perhaps to pick buttercups and daisies at Mudgee, when we were children,
    and the crusty old jockey-caretaker seemed to look on even that as a sacrilege,
    and would shoo us off. Later on, when I went there to shoot hares, I was
    shooed off again &mdash; because my gun might upset the nerves of a brood
    mare or two who boarded at the back of the grandstand. Even the offer of
    a hare now and then couldn&rsquo;t bribe the caretaker. So it was a good
    sanctuary.</p>
  <p>There was a lockup, or log or slab strongroom or &ldquo;dead-house&rdquo; at
    the course, for the convenience of the mad-drunks who were a natural result
    of a combination of horseracing, bad liquor, mixed drinks and mixed religions.
    Before that they used to be handcuffed to a bullock-chain stretched between
    two stumps, ten or a dozen at a time. Good, jolly old Father O&rsquo;D&mdash; used
    to go out every race meeting to &ldquo;keep the boys in order&rdquo; with
    his buggy-whip; but they said with a wink that he mostly had a horse running,
    too. The cemetery is quite close.</p>
  <p>Across Log Paddock from Our Hill, and across the &ldquo;crick&rdquo; are
    the bare, scalded slopes where Germany grew the vine long years agone and
    made money when the &ldquo;rushes&rdquo; came, maddening the diggers with
    new wine and making them throw away the gold they&rsquo;d come so far to
    win. Often they threw away their lives and souls too.</p>
  <p>But Germany also grew wheat and fruit and pigs and sheep and cattle: There
    is little, or few, or none of these now. Those slopes grow nothing now &mdash;  not
    even the native bush or grass; for, uproot them as you will, those old vineyards
    have spoiled the soil for anything else for long to come &mdash; maybe a
    hundred years or more. There are vineyards on the upper flats now, where
    wheat used to grow, and the abundant, heavy wine is ruining local youth and
    completing the ruin of local age.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know whether there&rsquo;s truth in wine, but I know there
    was madness in our kind, and there is plenty sad proof of it. Beer may be
    bad enough in cities, but I know the effects of that cheap, new or &ldquo;doctored&rdquo; wine
    in our districts. I sampled some of my native vintage at a &ldquo;wine&rdquo; shop
    (there are many of them) on my native heath, so to speak, when I last set
    foot on it on a visit some holidays past, and the effect was startling no
    less to myself than to my friends. I&rsquo;d arrived on good Australian beer,
    happy but sober. It took three days and several gallons of bottled ale to
    repair the damage.</p>
  <p>But sporting will have a worse effect on Australia, as a whole, for it leads
    to the neglect of the healthy vices as well as the healthy virtues; and,
    like healthy virtues, when healthy vices are neglected too long they perish.
    And when both perish a nation perishes.</p>
  <p>So we take a last look at Log Paddock, where nothing grows now but a little &ldquo;loosin&rdquo; and
    other hay &mdash; for the keows mostly, in time of drought.</p>
  <p>And at the Last Shaft, which I wrote about some time ago &mdash; which two
    of my father&rsquo;s old mates struggled so bravely to &ldquo;bottom&rdquo; (one
    of them died last year as a result of that struggle &mdash; and the other
    is hoeing grape-vines now). The shaft is a well now for the benefit of the
    cow. I suppose it will soon be a well for the benefit of that other curse
    of ours, horse racing.</p>
  <p>Let me see. In the first place they felt they had to exterminate the kangaroo.
    I saw the process of extermination. With the kangaroo (and the cattle later)
    went the useful or hunting dogs that might have kept down the rabbits. So
    the rabbits when they came got rid of the farmers &mdash; and, somehow, of
    the hares, too. Then someone imported starlings and sparrows and other birds,
    so the people will soon have to net their vineyards and orchards. Then someone
    imported the bony, useless carp, and they came up the &ldquo;cricks&rdquo; and
    are exterminating the edible native fish. (That was the only real, healthy
    recreation near Log Paddock &mdash; fishing.) Somebody put down a bore in
    order to drain the paddock underground and get at what little gold might
    be left, and the cool, pleasant evergreen surface springs dried up; and the
    creek, for some reason of its own, has shrunken; the clear, cool, she-oak,
    which shaded lily-decked pools of my old Eurunderee Creek, have vanished
    with the pleasant green banks and sedges, the reeds, the watercress and the
    water-lilies. The very water, what there is of it, seems dead &mdash; stale,
    unhealthy and yellow, like the dead face of a dyspeptic.</p>
  <p>So this is the end of Log Paddock, on the early settling days, the &ldquo;roaring&rdquo;  days
    and the farming days. The &rsquo;possums have gone, the magpies, the bell-birds,
    the butcher birds, the rosellas &mdash; all the native birds. Even the scents
    of the bush. And my own people are going too.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ALetterfromLeeton"></a>A Letter from Leeton</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Published in &ldquo;The Australian Soldiers&rsquo; Gift
      Book&rdquo; 1918</i></p>
  <p><i>To Corporal</i> ERNEST WATT (&ldquo;<i>Benno</i>&rdquo;) <i>of B Company,
      18th Battalion, formerly of Sydney, Calcutta, Egypt, the Dardanelles, And
      now recovering from wounds in Harefield Hospital, England.</i></p>
  <p>Dear Old Benno,</p>
  <p>Enclosed clipping from Melbourne <i>Age </i>will show you how I got on your
    track. I was very bad, and had been for some time, when I got your first
    letter, and was strongly entrenched in &ldquo;Havelock&rdquo;  Ward, Walker
    Hospital, when I got your second, and full of trouble.</p>
  <p>This is written from part of the Murrumbidgee, N.S.W., Irrigation Area,
    known as Yanco &mdash; I suppose you&rsquo;ve heard of it (it&rsquo;s been
    heard of a good deal lately). Anyway, you&rsquo;ll see it when you come Home.
    It is a spread of green, all chequered off, with little homes, and trees,
    and clear, green fringed canals and channels &mdash; just like English brooks &mdash; set
    in the midst of a bare, scorching, dusty red and parched yellow Dead Land
    that&rsquo;s a lot older than Egypt. You&rsquo;ve seen Egypt &mdash; desert,
    Nile, and oasis? &mdash; Well!</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ve put me in a little place on a two-acre block, with an orchard,
    and gum saplings growing along the back fence, and a clear &ldquo;channel&rdquo; with
    raised banks at my front and back gates where you can let the water in onto
    the ground. I&rsquo;ll hold it down anyway till one of our crippled mates
    comes back who knows more about fruit trees than I do. He won&rsquo;t want
    to know much. <i>You </i>know something about fruit anyhow, having peddled
    it often enough. I can tell a peach tree by eating a peach off it; or chewing
    a leaf &mdash; but that&rsquo;s about all.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s hot here in February, and last Saturday was the limit. It was
    a corker. It&rsquo;s so hot here just now that you can wash out your pants,
    and hang them on the line and run round the house and take them down dry.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a prohibition area, and the driest and thirstiest I ever struck
    in spite of the abundant water supply; and they rub it into us with picture
    shows with screens showing the Curse of Derrink. Every time a red hot dust
    storm comes along there&rsquo;s scarcely a man amongst us who wouldn&rsquo;t
    like to sample a gallon or two of that curse. We can only get together in
    the alleged cool of the evening and sing &ldquo;The Gate&rsquo;s a Jar for
    me&rdquo;, and hope for a demijohn from Narrandera (an ungodly town just
    outside the area.)</p>
  <p>I find that the greatest and bitterest &mdash; and, maybe the strongest &mdash;  opposition
    to our honest agitation for a decent pub, comes, not so much from the Wowsers,
    as indirectly, from the jar exporters of Narrandera, and directly from our
    own importers of tangle-foot and smiling-juice &mdash; the middlemen &mdash; from
    the Sly Grog Interests &mdash; Private Enterprise and Vested Interests again!
    The subsoil is as hard as &mdash;(this was locally censored). I wish I had
    some of your miners and sappers on my block, for I think it needs a throifle
    of dynamite in addition to the &ldquo;elbow grease&rdquo; the application
    of which our genial sub-manager is so constantly urging. But, with the aid
    of a two-ended pick, and a few loads of manure, any man can knock out a living
    here and have time to write poetry.</p>
  <p>The nights here are like the Breath of Paradise, and look like it, and the
    way the fruit trees and vines grow and bear is a miracle out of the Bible.
    They&rsquo;d grow in rock, I think, if watered three times a summer. The
    people appear to be about the most cosmopolitan and democratic I ever came
    across &mdash;  the pick of the middle-aged and elderly men from all corners
    of the Commonwealth and some of the best farmers from all corners of the
    world, from Finland (Land of Fens and Freedom) to Patagonia. There&rsquo;s
    a Patagonian colony here &mdash; I must look them up &mdash; and a Broken
    Hill colony &mdash; not beloved of officials (the third house from mine is
    called Broken Hill), and the women folk are mostly Bush women and girls,
    and wonderfully fair (not sun-burned); but, here and there and now and then
    you see (and hear) a Bushwoman of the &ldquo;Drover&rsquo;s Wife&rdquo; type.
    I&rsquo;ve just got acquaint&rsquo; wi&rsquo; a couple of Lancashire lassies
    (sisters) in business here. I had thought that Australian girls had no equals,
    but now I hae me doots. And I never saw such a gathering of the Clans! Even
    the few Irishmen here are so Irish that you can easily mistake them for Scots.
    I believe that Father Riedy is a Scot, back on one side or the other. But
    then, all Scots are Irish back on the mother&rsquo;s side. The Reverend Mr
    Campbell is more Irish than Father Riedy. They&rsquo;ve been at it for some
    time in the local &ldquo;Irrigator&rdquo;  (tantalising name for a paper
    here), till they suspected each other of Sictinarism and ended by fierce
    words. (It started over the pub question.) Then the editor (a big Sullivan,
    by the way) said that since the controversy had taken this turn it was now
    closed.</p>
  <p>And they&rsquo;re breeding jim-jam vegetables here too. &ldquo;Sugar&rdquo; or &ldquo;water&rdquo;  melons
    that are white inside, and pumpkins like green gourds from Egypt or the Holy
    Land; and rock melons that are Irish <i>green </i>inside shading into orange-yellow &mdash; a
    happy combination just now, come to think of it; and fantod marrows &mdash; or
    are they squashes? &mdash; like the knee frills of a clown. I half thought
    that they were a part of the Horrors of Prohibition when I first came to
    settle here.</p>
  <p>They all taste good &mdash; too good, indeed. But I sighed for a sight of
    the pumpkins of me childhood, that we used to cut up with an axe. You can
    peel these with a penknife. I did think I knew a pumpkin from a Bondi Bluebottle
    until I came to Leeton, and went into a shop to buy one. Of course, this
    being a good, irrigated, fruit and vegetable growing district, the fruit
    and vegetables you buy in shops are scarce and dear and scraggy.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ll breed something here yet. They&rsquo;ll breed the nucleus
    of a young race that will raise the Flag of Independence against Sydney &mdash; and
    Melbourne too, for that matter &mdash; and form the Home State of Australia,
    with Eden or Mallacoota and the Murray for its outlets, and Narrandera &mdash; that
    pretty, solid, green clad, cool, cleanly drowsy, boozy, and honest town &mdash; for
    the capital, and Leeton for its garden. Then you&rsquo;ll see the Australian
    flag again. The last time it was seen it was carried through the London Strand
    wreathed in flowers. What time we sent our thousands home to help the Dock
    Labourers.</p>
  <p>Of course you all heard how A&mdash; E&mdash; died. I saw him the day they
    marched down to the ships &mdash; was with him in the file &mdash; also his
    wife and daughter. I knew the meaning of a woman smiling through her tears
    then. She said he&rsquo;d be safe because the bullets would flatten on his
    face &mdash; and I believe they would have &mdash; but it was somewhere in
    the region of the heart that the poor chap got it at last. He was fifty-five
    if a day and as grey as a badger, but he&rsquo;d bluffed &rsquo;em all. You
    know how that drunken blackguard could bluff. His grin was in splendid working
    order, but I had my suspicions &mdash; there was something in his throat
    and eyes more than the fumes of the last whiskies he&rsquo;d got somehow.</p>
  <p>I met them in the street after the news came. The poor little woman was
    crying a good deal, but the girl&rsquo;s eyes were very dry, and a bit hard,
    I thought. She&rsquo;d stuck to her father all through as we all know. She
    looked at me straight in the eyes for a while, till I wondered what she was
    at. Then suddenly she said, defiant like, it seemed to me, <i>&ldquo;I knew
    my father would do it!&rdquo; </i>Then she choked and broke down and turned
    away. I was glad she did. And I was glad, too, then, if I hadn&rsquo;t been
    before, that I didn&rsquo;t turn her father down over that last gaol affair
    of his, when everyone else &mdash; even his own wife &mdash; did. They&rsquo;ve
    sent them his D.S.O. since, so I&rsquo;ve heard, and his daughter has it.
    His wife can hold up her head <i>now </i>when she hears his name mentioned.
    The daughter never held it down.</p>
  <p>A&mdash; E&mdash; saw his last chance and took it; and, I suppose, in that
    last charge of yours there was many a lone hand fighter like him. Not for
    a cause or a land that he knew nothing about and cared less. Not for his
    own country that had gaoled, starved, disgraced and ruined him for a disease
    which they called a crime; but for the sake of the one or two true friends
    who had believed in him and had stuck to him through it all.</p>
  <p>As a complete contrast to the story of poor E&mdash; comes the bright little
    story of my other friend, Cecil Hartt (&ldquo;the Harttist&rdquo;), who is
    in Harefield Hospital with you now. He might be your next pal there &mdash; I
    wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised. If he is, show this to him, and &mdash; if you
    are gone he&rsquo;ll read it all the same. He told me, last letter, that
    the Turks had shot him up with the very best intentions, and, any way it
    goes, &Iota; think Cecil is a lucky dog. To leave Sydney a not very well
    known and not very well paid artist, and, within three months, to see Asia
    and Africa, to charge up hill for his country, and to be brought back to
    Egypt a blooming full-blown hero! (He must have been a rather swearsome hero
    while the flies and dust lasted.) And none the worse but for the loss of
    a foot! If he&rsquo;d lost eighteen inches off those long legs of his he&rsquo;d
    still be a decent height. Besides, he doesn&rsquo;t <i>draw </i>with his
    foot, you know, and never did, notwithstanding what some low down shirking
    rival artists might have hinted to the contrary. And now he&rsquo;s comfortable
    in that great Harefield Hospital, amongst all&mdash;palls, and with Australian
    nurses to fuss round and see that he doesn&rsquo;t get all right too soon.
    And his work in demand by leading London illustrated papers!</p>
  <p>He told me, writing from the hospital in Egypt (Hellopolis or some name
    like that) that his heart was aching to be home in Australia again &mdash; as
    much as he had wanted to see England and France. Now, I&rsquo;ll tell you
    this, Benno, old chap, and you can tell the nurse if you like: married or
    single, &ldquo;happy&rdquo; home or not &mdash; <i>there&rsquo;s such a thing
    as home-homesickness </i>as well as the foreign kind; and when the hero welcome &mdash;  or
    prodigal son welcome &mdash; it doesn&rsquo;t matter which &mdash; is over,
    you&rsquo;ll feel in your bowels that awful, sinking, world-emptiness which
    is infinitely worse than any homesickness abroad, because it is born of the
    hoary father of all disillusions and is, or will seem to be the End &mdash; the
    Limit. It&rsquo;s a mighty reaction of course &mdash; the same as on the
    first night in a Promised Land, like this, after a long trip. It comes sudden
    and unexpected, like a hail of shrapnel in a clear sky. I&rsquo;ve felt <i>that </i>kind
    of home-sickness for the last place I came from, or for anywhere, and so,
    I suppose, have most of the other oldsters here. Then, for a space, you&rsquo;d
    be ready to hug the first stray Turk you came across, and drop a tear over
    his shoulder for the sake of the good old (they&rsquo;ll seem old <i>then) </i>the
    good old times you had with him.</p>
  <p>And if Allah does not forbid and I <i>do </i>get away after all &mdash; as
    doctor&rsquo;s orderly (or disorderly), mascot, or Regimental Goat, or something &mdash; and
    we pass each other on the water &mdash; I&rsquo;ll get a wireless to you
    somehow. And if a submarine gets us I&rsquo;ll get a wireless to you all
    the same. And if, when that message comes to you, [you] feel a chilly breath
    on your cheek &mdash; and maybe faintly catch the faint and mournful strains
    of a harp at the same time &mdash; you&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;ve been elected;
    but <i>you&rsquo;ll </i>be sure I&rsquo;ll be doing my best under those depressing
    circumstances and keeping up a fire for you. <i>If, </i>on the other hand,
    you feel a hot breath, and get a whiff of something like sulphur at the same
    time, you&rsquo;ll know that I&rsquo;m amongst friends and old pals, and
    looking out a cool and shady corner against your arrival. But we&rsquo;ll
    meet before that.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours ever,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henry
