  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="JoeWilsonsCourtship"></a>Joe Wilson&rsquo;s
      Courtship</b></h2>
  <p>There&nbsp;are many times in this world when a healthy boy is happy. When
    he is put into knickerbockers, for instance, and &lsquo;comes a man to-day,&rsquo; as
    my little Jim used to say. When they&rsquo;re cooking something at home that
    he likes. When the &lsquo;sandy-blight&rsquo; or measles breaks out amongst
    the children, or the teacher or his wife falls dangerously ill &mdash;or
    dies, it doesn&rsquo;t matter which&mdash;&lsquo;and there ain&rsquo;t no
    school.&rsquo; When a boy is naked and in his natural state for a warm climate
    like Australia, with three or four of his schoolmates, under the shade of
    the creek-oaks in the bend where there&rsquo;s a good clear pool with a sandy
    bottom. When his father buys him a gun, and he starts out after kangaroos
    or &rsquo;possums. When he gets a horse, saddle, and bridle, of his own.
    When he has his arm in splints or a stitch in his head&mdash; he&rsquo;s
    proud then, the proudest boy in the district.</p>
  <p>I wasn&rsquo;t a healthy-minded, average boy: I reckon I was born for a
    poet by mistake, and grew up to be a Bushman, and didn&rsquo;t know what
    was the matter with me&mdash;or the world&mdash;but that&rsquo;s got nothing
    to do with it.</p>
  <p>There are times when a man is happy. When he finds out that the girl loves
    him. When he&rsquo;s just married. When he&rsquo;s a lawful father for the
    first time, and everything is going on all right: some men make fools of
    themselves then&mdash;I know I did. I&rsquo;m happy to-night because I&rsquo;m
    out of debt and can see clear ahead, and because I haven&rsquo;t been easy
    for a long time.</p>
  <p>But I think that the happiest time in a man&rsquo;s life is when he&rsquo;s
    courting a girl and finds out for sure that she loves him and hasn&rsquo;t
    a thought for any one else. Make the most of your courting days, you young
    chaps, and keep them clean, for they&rsquo;re about the only days when there&rsquo;s
    a chance of poetry and beauty coming into this life. Make the best of them
    and you&rsquo;ll never regret it the longest day you live. They&rsquo;re
    the days that the wife will look back to, anyway, in the brightest of times
    as well as in the blackest, and there shouldn&rsquo;t be anything in those
    days that might hurt her when she looks back. Make the most of your courting
    days, you young chaps, for they will never come again.</p>
  <p>A married man knows all about it&mdash;after a while: he sees the woman
    world through the eyes of his wife; he knows what an extra moment&rsquo;s
    pressure of the hand means, and, if he has had a hard life, and is inclined
    to be cynical, the knowledge does him no good. It leads him into awful messes
    sometimes, for a married man, if he&rsquo;s inclined that way, has three
    times the chance with a woman that a single man has&mdash;because the married
    man knows. He is privileged; he can guess pretty closely what a woman means
    when she says something else; he knows just how far he can go; he can go
    farther in five minutes towards coming to the point with a woman than an
    innocent young man dares go in three weeks. Above all, the married man is
    more decided with women; he takes them and things for granted. In short he
    is&mdash; well, he is a married man. And, when he knows all this, how much
    better or happier is he for it? Mark Twain says that he lost all the beauty
    of the river when he saw it with a pilot&rsquo;s eye,&mdash; and there you
    have it.</p>
  <p>But it&rsquo;s all new to a young chap, provided he hasn&rsquo;t been a
    young blackguard. It&rsquo;s all wonderful, new, and strange to him. He&rsquo;s
    a different man. He finds that he never knew anything about women. He sees
    none of woman&rsquo;s little ways and tricks in his girl. He is in heaven
    one day and down near the other place the next; and that&rsquo;s the sort
    of thing that makes life interesting. He takes his new world for granted.
    And, when she says she&rsquo;ll be his wife&mdash;&mdash;!</p>
  <p>Make the most of your courting days, you young chaps, for they&rsquo;ve
    got a lot of influence on your married life afterwards&mdash;a lot more than
    you&rsquo;d think. Make the best of them, for they&rsquo;ll never come any
    more, unless we do our courting over again in another world. If we do, I&rsquo;ll
    make the most of mine.</p>
  <p>But, looking back, I didn&rsquo;t do so badly after all. I never told you
    about the days I courted Mary. The more I look back the more I come to think
    that I made the most of them, and if I had no more to regret in married life
    than I have in my courting days, I wouldn&rsquo;t walk to and fro in the
    room, or up and down the yard in the dark sometimes, or lie awake some nights
    thinking. . . . Ah well!</p>
  <p>I was between twenty-one and thirty then: birthdays had never been any use
    to me, and I&rsquo;d left off counting them. You don&rsquo;t take much stock
    in birthdays in the Bush. I&rsquo;d knocked about the country for a few years,
    shearing and fencing and droving a little, and wasting my life without getting
    anything for it. I drank now and then, and made a fool of myself. I was reckoned &lsquo;wild&rsquo;;
    but I only drank because I felt less sensitive, and the world seemed a lot
    saner and better and kinder when I had a few drinks: I loved my fellow-man
    then and felt nearer to him. It&rsquo;s better to be thought &lsquo;wild&rsquo; than
    to be considered eccentric or ratty. Now, my old mate, Jack Barnes, drank&mdash;as
    far as I could see&mdash;  first because he&rsquo;d inherited the gambling
    habit from his father along with his father&rsquo;s luck: he&rsquo;d the
    habit of being cheated and losing very bad, and when he lost he drank. Till
    drink got a hold on him. Jack was sentimental too, but in a different way.
    I was sentimental about other people&mdash;more fool I!&mdash;whereas Jack
    was sentimental about himself. Before he was married, and when he was recovering
    from a spree, he&rsquo;d write rhymes about &lsquo;Only a boy, drunk by the
    roadside&rsquo;, and that sort of thing; and he&rsquo;d call &rsquo;em poetry,
    and talk about signing them and sending them to the&nbsp;<i>Town and Country
    Journal</i>. But he generally tore them up when he got better. The Bush is
    breeding a race of poets, and I don&rsquo;t know what the country will come
    to in the end.</p>
  <p>Well. It was after Jack and I had been out shearing at Beenaway shed in
    the Big Scrubs. Jack was living in the little farming town of Solong, and
    I was hanging round. Black, the squatter, wanted some fencing done and a
    new stable built, or buggy and harness-house, at his place at Haviland, a
    few miles out of Solong. Jack and I were good Bush carpenters, so we took
    the job to keep us going till something else turned up. &lsquo;Better than
    doing nothing,&rsquo;  said Jack.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s a nice little girl in service at Black&rsquo;s,&rsquo; he
    said.  &lsquo;She&rsquo;s more like an adopted daughter, in fact, than a
    servant. She&rsquo;s a real good little girl, and good-looking into the bargain.
    I hear that young Black is sweet on her, but they say she won&rsquo;t have
    anything to do with him. I know a lot of chaps that have tried for her, but
    they&rsquo;ve never had any luck. She&rsquo;s a regular little dumpling,
    and I like dumplings. They call her &rsquo;Possum. You ought to try a bear
    up in that direction, Joe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was always shy with women&mdash;except perhaps some that I should have
    fought shy of; but Jack wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he was afraid of no woman, good,
    bad, or indifferent. I haven&rsquo;t time to explain why, but somehow, whenever
    a girl took any notice of me I took it for granted that she was only playing
    with me, and felt nasty about it. I made one or two mistakes, but&mdash;ah
    well!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My wife knows little &rsquo;Possum,&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    get her to ask her out to our place and let you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I reckoned that he wouldn&rsquo;t get me there then, and made a note to
    be on the watch for tricks. I had a hopeless little love-story behind me,
    of course. I suppose most married men can look back to their lost love; few
    marry the first flame. Many a married man looks back and thinks it was damned
    lucky that he didn&rsquo;t get the girl he couldn&rsquo;t have. Jack had
    been my successful rival, only he didn&rsquo;t know it&mdash; I don&rsquo;t
    think his wife knew it either. I used to think her the prettiest and sweetest
    little girl in the district.</p>
  <p>But Jack was mighty keen on fixing me up with the little girl at Haviland.
    He seemed to take it for granted that I was going to fall in love with her
    at first sight. He took too many things for granted as far as I was concerned,
    and got me into awful tangles sometimes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You let me alone, and I&rsquo;ll fix you up, Joe,&rsquo; he said,
    as we rode up to the station. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make it all right with the
    girl. You&rsquo;re rather a good-looking chap. You&rsquo;ve got the sort
    of eyes that take with girls, only you don&rsquo;t know it; you haven&rsquo;t
    got the go. If I had your eyes along with my other attractions, I&rsquo;d
    be in trouble on account of a woman about once a-week.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake shut up, Jack,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>Do you remember the first glimpse you got of your wife? Perhaps not in England,
    where so many couples grow up together from childhood; but it&rsquo;s different
    in Australia, where you may hail from two thousand miles away from where
    your wife was born, and yet she may be a countrywoman of yours, and a countrywoman
    in ideas and politics too. I remember the first glimpse I got of Mary.</p>
  <p>It was a two-storey brick house with wide balconies and verandahs all round,
    and a double row of pines down to the front gate. Parallel at the back was
    an old slab-and-shingle place, one room deep and about eight rooms long,
    with a row of skillions at the back: the place was used for kitchen, laundry,
    servants&rsquo; rooms, &amp;c. This was the old homestead before the new
    house was built. There was a wide, old-fashioned, brick-floored verandah
    in front, with an open end; there was ivy climbing up the verandah post on
    one side and a baby-rose on the other, and a grape-vine near the chimney.
    We rode up to the end of the verandah, and Jack called to see if there was
    any one at home, and Mary came trotting out; so it was in the frame of vines
    that I first saw her.</p>
  <p>More than once since then I&rsquo;ve had a fancy to wonder whether the rose-bush
    killed the grape-vine or the ivy smothered &rsquo;em both in the end. I used
    to have a vague idea of riding that way some day to see. You do get strange
    fancies at odd times.</p>
  <p>Jack asked her if the boss was in. He did all the talking. I saw a little
    girl, rather plump, with a complexion like a New England or Blue Mountain
    girl, or a girl from Tasmania or from Gippsland in Victoria. Red and white
    girls were very scarce in the Solong district. She had the biggest and brightest
    eyes I&rsquo;d seen round there, dark hazel eyes, as I found out afterwards,
    and bright as a &rsquo;possum&rsquo;s. No wonder they called her &ldquo;Possum&rdquo;.
    I forgot at once that Mrs Jack Barnes was the prettiest girl in the district.
    I felt a sort of comfortable satisfaction in the fact that I was on horseback:
    most Bushmen look better on horseback. It was a black filly, a fresh young
    thing, and she seemed as shy of girls as I was myself. I noticed Mary glanced
    in my direction once or twice to see if she knew me; but, when she looked,
    the filly took all my attention. Mary trotted in to tell old Black he was
    wanted, and after Jack had seen him, and arranged to start work next day,
    we started back to Solong.</p>
  <p>I expected Jack to ask me what I thought of Mary&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t.
    He squinted at me sideways once or twice and didn&rsquo;t say anything for
    a long time, and then he started talking of other things. I began to feel
    wild at him. He seemed so damnably satisfied with the way things were going.
    He seemed to reckon that I was a gone case now; but, as he didn&rsquo;t say
    so, I had no way of getting at him. I felt sure he&rsquo;d go home and tell
    his wife that Joe Wilson was properly gone on little &rsquo;Possum at Haviland.
    That was all Jack&rsquo;s way.</p>
  <p>Next morning we started to work. We were to build the buggy-house at the
    back near the end of the old house, but first we had to take down a rotten
    old place that might have been the original hut in the Bush before the old
    house was built. There was a window in it, opposite the laundry window in
    the old place, and the first thing I did was to take out the sash. I&rsquo;d
    noticed Jack yarning with &rsquo;Possum before he started work. While I was
    at work at the window he called me round to the other end of the hut to help
    him lift a grindstone out of the way; and when we&rsquo;d done it, he took
    the tips of my ear between his fingers and thumb and stretched it and whispered
    into it&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry with that window, Joe; the strips are hardwood
    and hard to get off&mdash;you&rsquo;ll have to take the sash out very carefully
    so as not to break the glass.&rsquo; Then he stretched my ear a little more
    and put his mouth closer&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Make a looking-glass of that window, Joe,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I was used to Jack, and when I went back to the window I started to puzzle
    out what he meant, and presently I saw it by chance.</p>
  <p>That window reflected the laundry window: the room was dark inside and there
    was a good clear reflection; and presently I saw Mary come to the laundry
    window and stand with her hands behind her back, thoughtfully watching me.
    The laundry window had an old-fashioned hinged sash, and I like that sort
    of window&mdash;there&rsquo;s more romance about it, I think. There was thick
    dark-green ivy all round the window, and Mary looked prettier than a picture.
    I squared up my shoulders and put my heels together and put as much style
    as I could into the work. I couldn&rsquo;t have turned round to save my life.</p>
  <p>Presently Jack came round, and Mary disappeared.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fool, Jack,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s only
    interested in the old house being pulled down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been keeping
    an eye on the business round the corner, and she ain&rsquo;t interested when&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m</i>&nbsp;round
    this end.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You seem mighty interested in the business,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;This sort of thing just suits a man
    of my rank in times of peace.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What made you think of the window?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s as simple as striking matches. I&rsquo;m up to all
    those dodges. Why, where there wasn&rsquo;t a window, I&rsquo;ve fixed up
    a piece of looking-glass to see if a girl was taking any notice of me when
    she thought I wasn&rsquo;t looking.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He went away, and presently Mary was at the window again, and this time
    she had a tray with cups of tea and a plate of cake and bread-and-butter.
    I was prizing off the strips that held the sash, very carefully, and my heart
    suddenly commenced to gallop, without any reference to me. I&rsquo;d never
    felt like that before, except once or twice. It was just as if I&rsquo;d
    swallowed some clockwork arrangement, unconsciously, and it had started to
    go, without warning. I reckon it was all on account of that blarsted Jack
    working me up. He had a quiet way of working you up to a thing, that made
    you want to hit him sometimes&mdash;after you&rsquo;d made an ass of yourself.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t hear Mary at first. I hoped Jack would come round and help
    me out of the fix, but he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mr&mdash;Mr Wilson!&rsquo; said Mary. She had a sweet voice.</p>
  <p>I turned round.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought you and Mr Barnes might like a cup of tea.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you!&rsquo; I said, and I made a dive for the window, as
    if hurry would help it. I trod on an old cask-hoop; it sprang up and dinted
    my shin and I stumbled&mdash;and that didn&rsquo;t help matters much.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! did you hurt yourself, Mr Wilson?&rsquo; cried Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hurt myself! Oh no, not at all, thank you,&rsquo; I blurted out. &lsquo;It
    takes more than that to hurt me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was about the reddest shy lanky fool of a Bushman that was ever taken
    at a disadvantage on foot, and when I took the tray my hands shook so that
    a lot of the tea was spilt into the saucers. I embarrassed her too, like
    the damned fool I was, till she must have been as red as I was, and it&rsquo;s
    a wonder we didn&rsquo;t spill the whole lot between us. I got away from
    the window in as much of a hurry as if Jack had cut his leg with a chisel
    and fainted, and I was running with whisky for him. I blundered round to
    where he was, feeling like a man feels when he&rsquo;s just made an ass of
    himself in public. The memory of that sort of thing hurts you worse and makes
    you jerk your head more impatiently than the thought of a past crime would,
    I think.</p>
  <p>I pulled myself together when I got to where Jack was.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, Jack!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve struck something all
    right; here&rsquo;s some tea and brownie&mdash;we&rsquo;ll hang out here
    all right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jack took a cup of tea and a piece of cake and sat down to enjoy it, just
    as if he&rsquo;d paid for it and ordered it to be sent out about that time.</p>
  <p>He was silent for a while, with the sort of silence that always made me
    wild at him. Presently he said, as if he&rsquo;d just thought of it&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a very pretty little girl, &rsquo;Possum, isn&rsquo;t
    she, Joe? Do you notice how she dresses?&mdash;always fresh and trim. But
    she&rsquo;s got on her best bib-and-tucker to-day, and a pinafore with frills
    to it. And it&rsquo;s ironing-day, too. It can&rsquo;t be on your account.
    If it was Saturday or Sunday afternoon, or some holiday, I could understand
    it. But perhaps one of her admirers is going to take her to the church bazaar
    in Solong to-night. That&rsquo;s what it is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He gave me time to think over that.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But yet she seems interested in you, Joe,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Why
    didn&rsquo;t you offer to take her to the bazaar instead of letting another
    chap get in ahead of you? You miss all your chances, Joe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then a thought struck me. I ought to have known Jack well enough to have
    thought of it before.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Jack,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;What have you been saying
    to that girl about me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, not much,&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;There isn&rsquo;t much to
    say about you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did you tell her?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing in particular. She&rsquo;d heard all about you before.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She hadn&rsquo;t heard much good, I suppose,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s true, as far as I could make out. But you&rsquo;ve
    only got yourself to blame. I didn&rsquo;t have the breeding and rearing
    of you. I smoothed over matters with her as much as I could.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did you tell her?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what I
    want to know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, to tell the truth, I didn&rsquo;t tell her anything much. I
    only answered questions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what questions did she ask?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, in the first place, she asked if your name wasn&rsquo;t Joe
    Wilson; and I said it was, as far as I knew. Then she said she heard that
    you wrote poetry, and I had to admit that that was true.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Jack,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve two minds to punch
    your head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And she asked me if it was true that you were wild,&rsquo; said Jack,  &lsquo;and
    I said you was, a bit. She said it seemed a pity. She asked me if it was
    true that you drank, and I drew a long face and said that I was sorry to
    say it was true. She asked me if you had any friends, and I said none that
    I knew of, except me. I said that you&rsquo;d lost all your friends; they
    stuck to you as long as they could, but they had to give you best, one after
    the other.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What next?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She asked me if you were delicate, and I said no, you were as tough
    as fencing-wire. She said you looked rather pale and thin, and asked me if
    you&rsquo;d had an illness lately. And I said no&mdash; it was all on account
    of the wild, dissipated life you&rsquo;d led. She said it was a pity you
    hadn&rsquo;t a mother or a sister to look after you&mdash; it was a pity
    that something couldn&rsquo;t be done for you, and I said it was, but I was
    afraid that nothing could be done. I told her that I was doing all I could
    to keep you straight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I knew enough of Jack to know that most of this was true. And so she only
    pitied me after all. I felt as if I&rsquo;d been courting her for six months
    and she&rsquo;d thrown me over&mdash;but I didn&rsquo;t know anything about
    women yet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you tell her I was in jail?&rsquo; I growled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, by Gum! I forgot that. But never mind I&rsquo;ll fix that up
    all right. I&rsquo;ll tell her that you got two years&rsquo; hard for horse-stealing.
    That ought to make her interested in you, if she isn&rsquo;t already.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We smoked a while.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And was that all she said?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who?&mdash;Oh! &rsquo;Possum,&rsquo; said Jack rousing himself. &lsquo;Well&mdash;no;
    let me think&mdash;&mdash; We got chatting of other things&mdash;you know
    a married man&rsquo;s privileged, and can say a lot more to a girl than a
    single man can. I got talking nonsense about sweethearts, and one thing led
    to another till at last she said, &ldquo;I suppose Mr Wilson&rsquo;s got
    a sweetheart, Mr Barnes?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what did you say?&rsquo; I growled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I told her that you were a holy terror amongst the girls,&rsquo;  said
    Jack. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better take back that tray, Joe, and let us get
    to work.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t take back the tray&mdash;but that didn&rsquo;t mend matters,
    for Jack took it back himself.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t see Mary&rsquo;s reflection in the window again, so I took
    the window out. I reckoned that she was just a big-hearted, impulsive little
    thing, as many Australian girls are, and I reckoned that I was a fool for
    thinking for a moment that she might give me a second thought, except by
    way of kindness. Why! young Black and half a dozen better men than me were
    sweet on her, and young Black was to get his father&rsquo;s station and the
    money&mdash;or rather his mother&rsquo;s money, for she held the stuff (she
    kept it close too, by all accounts). Young Black was away at the time, and
    his mother was dead against him about Mary, but that didn&rsquo;t make any
    difference, as far as I could see. I reckoned that it was only just going
    to be a hopeless, heart-breaking, stand-far-off-and-worship affair, as far
    as I was concerned&mdash; like my first love affair, that I haven&rsquo;t
    told you about yet. I was tired of being pitied by good girls. You see, I
    didn&rsquo;t know women then. If I had known, I think I might have made more
    than one mess of my life.</p>
  <p>Jack rode home to Solong every night. I was staying at a pub some distance
    out of town, between Solong and Haviland. There were three or four wet days,
    and we didn&rsquo;t get on with the work. I fought shy of Mary till one day
    she was hanging out clothes and the line broke. It was the old-style sixpenny
    clothes-line. The clothes were all down, but it was clean grass, so it didn&rsquo;t
    matter much. I looked at Jack.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go and help her, you capital Idiot!&rsquo; he said, and I made the
    plunge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson!&rsquo; said Mary, when I came to help.
    She had the broken end of the line and was trying to hold some of the clothes
    off the ground, as if she could pull it an inch with the heavy wet sheets
    and table-cloths and things on it, or as if it would do any good if she did.
    But that&rsquo;s the way with women &mdash;especially little women&mdash;some
    of &rsquo;em would try to pull a store bullock if they got the end of the
    rope on the right side of the fence. I took the line from Mary, and accidentally
    touched her soft, plump little hand as I did so: it sent a thrill right through
    me. She seemed a lot cooler than I was.</p>
  <p>Now, in cases like this, especially if you lose your head a bit, you get
    hold of the loose end of the rope that&rsquo;s hanging from the post with
    one hand, and the end of the line with the clothes on with the other, and
    try to pull &rsquo;em far enough together to make a knot. And that&rsquo;s
    about all you do for the present, except look like a fool. Then I took off
    the post end, spliced the line, took it over the fork, and pulled, while
    Mary helped me with the prop. I thought Jack might have come and taken the
    prop from her, but he didn&rsquo;t; he just went on with his work as if nothing
    was happening inside the horizon.</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;d got the line about two-thirds full of clothes, it was a bit
    short now, so she had to jump and catch it with one hand and hold it down
    while she pegged a sheet she&rsquo;d thrown over. I&rsquo;d made the plunge
    now, so I volunteered to help her. I held down the line while she threw the
    things over and pegged out. As we got near the post and higher I straightened
    out some ends and pegged myself. Bushmen are handy at most things. We laughed,
    and now and again Mary would say, &lsquo;No, that&rsquo;s not the way, Mr
    Wilson; that&rsquo;s not right; the sheet isn&rsquo;t far enough over; wait
    till I fix it,&rsquo; &amp;c. I&rsquo;d a reckless idea once of holding her
    up while she pegged, and I was glad afterwards that I hadn&rsquo;t made such
    a fool of myself.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s only a few more things in the basket, Miss Brand,&rsquo; I
    said. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t reach&mdash;I&rsquo;ll fix &rsquo;em up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She seemed to give a little gasp.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, those things are not ready yet,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
    not rinsed,&rsquo; and she grabbed the basket and held it away from me. The
    things looked the same to me as the rest on the line; they looked rinsed
    enough and blued too. I reckoned that she didn&rsquo;t want me to take the
    trouble, or thought that I mightn&rsquo;t like to be seen hanging out clothes,
    and was only doing it out of kindness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s no trouble,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;let me hang &rsquo;em
    out. I like it. I&rsquo;ve hung out clothes at home on a windy day,&rsquo; and
    I made a reach into the basket. But she flushed red, with temper I thought,
    and snatched the basket away.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Excuse me, Mr Wilson,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but those things are
    not ready yet!&rsquo; and she marched into the wash-house.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah well! you&rsquo;ve got a little temper of your own,&rsquo; I thought
    to myself.</p>
  <p>When I told Jack, he said that I&rsquo;d made another fool of myself. He
    said I&rsquo;d both disappointed and offended her. He said that my line was
    to stand off a bit and be serious and melancholy in the background.</p>
  <p>That evening when we&rsquo;d started home, we stopped some time yarning
    with a chap we met at the gate; and I happened to look back, and saw Mary
    hanging out the rest of the things&mdash;she thought that we were out of
    sight. Then I understood why those things weren&rsquo;t ready while we were
    round.</p>
  <p>For the next day or two Mary didn&rsquo;t take the slightest notice of me,
    and I kept out of her way. Jack said I&rsquo;d disillusioned her&mdash; and
    hurt her dignity&mdash;which was a thousand times worse. He said I&rsquo;d
    spoilt the thing altogether. He said that she&rsquo;d got an idea that I
    was shy and poetic, and I&rsquo;d only shown myself the usual sort of Bush-whacker.</p>
  <p>I noticed her talking and chatting with other fellows once or twice, and
    it made me miserable. I got drunk two evenings running, and then, as it appeared
    afterwards, Mary consulted Jack, and at last she said to him, when we were
    together&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you play draughts, Mr Barnes?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you, Mr Wilson?&rsquo; she asked, suddenly turning her big, bright
    eyes on me, and speaking to me for the first time since last washing-day.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I do a little.&rsquo; Then there was a
    silence, and I had to say something else.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you play draughts, Miss Brand?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but I can&rsquo;t get any one to play
    with me here of an evening, the men are generally playing cards or reading.&rsquo; Then
    she said,  &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very dull these long winter evenings when you&rsquo;ve
    got nothing to do. Young Mr Black used to play draughts, but he&rsquo;s away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I saw Jack winking at me urgently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll play a game with you, if you like,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;but
    I ain&rsquo;t much of a player.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson! When shall you have an evening to spare?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We fixed it for that same evening. We got chummy over the draughts. I had
    a suspicion even then that it was a put-up job to keep me away from the pub.</p>
  <p>Perhaps she found a way of giving a hint to old Black without committing
    herself. Women have ways&mdash;or perhaps Jack did it. Anyway, next day the
    Boss came round and said to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe, you&rsquo;ve got no occasion to stay at the pub.
    Bring along your blankets and camp in one of the spare rooms of the old house.
    You can have your tucker here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He was a good sort, was Black the squatter: a squatter of the old school,
    who&rsquo;d shared the early hardships with his men, and couldn&rsquo;t see
    why he should not shake hands and have a smoke and a yarn over old times
    with any of his old station hands that happened to come along. But he&rsquo;d
    married an Englishwoman after the hardships were over, and she&rsquo;d never
    got any Australian notions.</p>
  <p>Next day I found one of the skillion rooms scrubbed out and a bed fixed
    up for me. I&rsquo;m not sure to this day who did it, but I supposed that
    good-natured old Black had given one of the women a hint. After tea I had
    a yarn with Mary, sitting on a log of the wood-heap. I don&rsquo;t remember
    exactly how we both came to be there, or who sat down first. There was about
    two feet between us. We got very chummy and confidential. She told me about
    her childhood and her father.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d been an old mate of Black&rsquo;s, a younger son of a well-to-do
    English family (with blue blood in it, I believe), and sent out to Australia
    with a thousand pounds to make his way, as many younger sons are, with more
    or less. They think they&rsquo;re hard done by; they blue their thousand
    pounds in Melbourne or Sydney, and they don&rsquo;t make any more nowadays,
    for the Roarin&rsquo;  Days have been dead these thirty years. I wish I&rsquo;d
    had a thousand pounds to start on!</p>
  <p>Mary&rsquo;s mother was the daughter of a German immigrant, who selected
    up there in the old days. She had a will of her own as far as I could understand,
    and bossed the home till the day of her death. Mary&rsquo;s father made money,
    and lost it, and drank&mdash;and died. Mary remembered him sitting on the
    verandah one evening with his hand on her head, and singing a German song
    (the  &lsquo;Lorelei&rsquo;, I think it was) softly, as if to himself. Next
    day he stayed in bed, and the children were kept out of the room; and, when
    he died, the children were adopted round (there was a little money coming
    from England).</p>
  <p>Mary told me all about her girlhood. She went first to live with a sort
    of cousin in town, in a house where they took in cards on a tray, and then
    she came to live with Mrs Black, who took a fancy to her at first. I&rsquo;d
    had no boyhood to speak of, so I gave her some of my ideas of what the world
    ought to be, and she seemed interested.</p>
  <p>Next day there were sheets on my bed, and I felt pretty cocky until I remembered
    that I&rsquo;d told her I had no one to care for me; then I suspected pity
    again.</p>
  <p>But next evening we remembered that both our fathers and mothers were dead,
    and discovered that we had no friends except Jack and old Black, and things
    went on very satisfactorily.</p>
  <p>And next day there was a little table in my room with a crocheted cover
    and a looking-glass.</p>
  <p>I noticed the other girls began to act mysterious and giggle when I was
    round, but Mary didn&rsquo;t seem aware of it.</p>
  <p>We got very chummy. Mary wasn&rsquo;t comfortable at Haviland. Old Black
    was very fond of her and always took her part, but she wanted to be independent.
    She had a great idea of going to Sydney and getting into the hospital as
    a nurse. She had friends in Sydney, but she had no money. There was a little
    money coming to her when she was twenty-one&mdash;a few pounds&mdash;and
    she was going to try and get it before that time.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Miss Brand,&rsquo; I said, after we&rsquo;d watched the
    moon rise.  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you the money. I&rsquo;ve got plenty&mdash;more
    than I know what to do with.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But I saw I&rsquo;d hurt her. She sat up very straight for a while, looking
    before her; then she said it was time to go in, and said &lsquo;Good-night,
    Mr Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I reckoned I&rsquo;d done it that time; but Mary told me afterwards that
    she was only hurt because it struck her that what she said about money might
    have been taken for a hint. She didn&rsquo;t understand me yet, and I didn&rsquo;t
    know human nature. I didn&rsquo;t say anything to Jack&mdash; in fact about
    this time I left off telling him about things. He didn&rsquo;t seem hurt;
    he worked hard and seemed happy.</p>
  <p>I really meant what I said to Mary about the money. It was pure good nature.
    I&rsquo;d be a happier man now, I think, and richer man perhaps, if I&rsquo;d
    never grown any more selfish than I was that night on the wood-heap with
    Mary. I felt a great sympathy for her&mdash; but I got to love her. I went
    through all the ups and downs of it. One day I was having tea in the kitchen,
    and Mary and another girl, named Sarah, reached me a clean plate at the same
    time: I took Sarah&rsquo;s plate because she was first, and Mary seemed very
    nasty about it, and that gave me great hopes. But all next evening she played
    draughts with a drover that she&rsquo;d chummed up with. I pretended to be
    interested in Sarah&rsquo;s talk, but it didn&rsquo;t seem to work.</p>
  <p>A few days later a Sydney Jackaroo visited the station. He had a good pea-rifle,
    and one afternoon he started to teach Mary to shoot at a target. They seemed
    to get very chummy. I had a nice time for three or four days, I can tell
    you. I was worse than a wall-eyed bullock with the pleuro. The other chaps
    had a shot out of the rifle. Mary called &lsquo;Mr Wilson&rsquo; to have
    a shot, and I made a worse fool of myself by sulking. If it hadn&rsquo;t
    been a blooming Jackaroo I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded so much.</p>
  <p>Next evening the Jackaroo and one or two other chaps and the girls went
    out &rsquo;possum-shooting. Mary went. I could have gone, but I didn&rsquo;t.
    I mooched round all the evening like an orphan bandicoot on a burnt ridge,
    and then I went up to the pub and filled myself with beer, and damned the
    world, and came home and went to bed. I think that evening was the only time
    I ever wrote poetry down on a piece of paper. I got so miserable that I enjoyed
    it.</p>
  <p>I felt better next morning, and reckoned I was cured. I ran against Mary
    accidentally and had to say something.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How did you enjoy yourself yesterday evening, Miss Brand?&rsquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, very well, thank you, Mr Wilson,&rsquo; she said. Then she asked,  &lsquo;How
    did you enjoy yourself, Mr Wilson?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I puzzled over that afterwards, but couldn&rsquo;t make anything out of
    it. Perhaps she only said it for the sake of saying something. But about
    this time my handkerchiefs and collars disappeared from the room and turned
    up washed and ironed and laid tidily on my table. I used to keep an eye out,
    but could never catch anybody near my room. I straightened up, and kept my
    room a bit tidy, and when my handkerchief got too dirty, and I was ashamed
    of letting it go to the wash, I&rsquo;d slip down to the river after dark
    and wash it out, and dry it next day, and rub it up to look as if it hadn&rsquo;t
    been washed, and leave it on my table. I felt so full of hope and joy that
    I worked twice as hard as Jack, till one morning he remarked casually&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I see you&rsquo;ve made a new mash, Joe. I saw the half-caste cook
    tidying up your room this morning and taking your collars and things to the
    wash-house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I felt very much off colour all the rest of the day, and I had such a bad
    night of it that I made up my mind next morning to look the hopelessness
    square in the face and live the thing down.</p>
  <p>It was the evening before Anniversary Day. Jack and I had put in a good
    day&rsquo;s work to get the job finished, and Jack was having a smoke and
    a yarn with the chaps before he started home. We sat on an old log along
    by the fence at the back of the house. There was Jimmy Nowlett the bullock-driver,
    and long Dave Regan the drover, and big Jim Bullock the fencer, and one or
    two others. Mary and the station girls and one or two visitors were sitting
    under the old verandah. The Jackaroo was there too, so I felt happy. It was
    the girls who used to bring the chaps hanging round. They were getting up
    a dance party for Anniversary night. Along in the evening another chap came
    riding up to the station: he was a big shearer, a dark, handsome fellow,
    who looked like a gipsy: it was reckoned that there was foreign blood in
    him. He went by the name of Romany. He was supposed to be shook after Mary
    too. He had the nastiest temper and the best violin in the district, and
    the chaps put up with him a lot because they wanted him to play at Bush dances.
    The moon had risen over Pine Ridge, but it was dusky where we were. We saw
    Romany loom up, riding in from the gate; he rode round the end of the coach-house
    and across towards where we were&mdash; I suppose he was going to tie up
    his horse at the fence; but about half-way across the grass he disappeared.
    It struck me that there was something peculiar about the way he got down,
    and I heard a sound like a horse stumbling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What the hell&rsquo;s Romany trying to do?&rsquo; said Jimmy Nowlett. &lsquo;He
    couldn&rsquo;t have fell off his horse&mdash;or else he&rsquo;s drunk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A couple of chaps got up and went to see. Then there was that waiting, mysterious
    silence that comes when something happens in the dark and nobody knows what
    it is. I went over, and the thing dawned on me. I&rsquo;d stretched a wire
    clothes-line across there during the day, and had forgotten all about it
    for the moment. Romany had no idea of the line, and, as he rode up, it caught
    him on a level with his elbows and scraped him off his horse. He was sitting
    on the grass, swearing in a surprised voice, and the horse looked surprised
    too. Romany wasn&rsquo;t hurt, but the sudden shock had spoilt his temper.
    He wanted to know who&rsquo;d put up that bloody line. He came over and sat
    on the log. The chaps smoked a while.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did you git down so sudden for, Romany?&rsquo; asked Jim Bullock
    presently. &lsquo;Did you hurt yerself on the pommel?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you ask the horse to go round?&rsquo; asked Dave
    Regan.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;d only like to know who put up that bleeding wire!&rsquo; growled
    Romany.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jimmy Nowlett, &lsquo;if we&rsquo;d put up a sign
    to beware of the line you couldn&rsquo;t have seen it in the dark.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Unless it was a transparency with a candle behind it,&rsquo; said
    Dave Regan. &lsquo;But why didn&rsquo;t you get down on one end, Romany,
    instead of all along? It wouldn&rsquo;t have jolted yer so much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>All this with the Bush drawl, and between the puffs of their pipes. But
    I didn&rsquo;t take any interest in it. I was brooding over Mary and the
    Jackaroo.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of men getting down over their horse&rsquo;s head,&rsquo; said
    Dave presently, in a reflective sort of way&mdash;&lsquo;in fact I&rsquo;ve
    done it myself&mdash; but I never saw a man get off backwards over his horse&rsquo;s
    rump.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But they saw that Romany was getting nasty, and they wanted him to play
    the fiddle next night, so they dropped it.</p>
  <p>Mary was singing an old song. I always thought she had a sweet voice, and
    I&rsquo;d have enjoyed it if that damned Jackaroo hadn&rsquo;t been listening
    too. We listened in silence until she&rsquo;d finished.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That gal&rsquo;s got a nice voice,&rsquo; said Jimmy Nowlett.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nice voice!&rsquo; snarled Romany, who&rsquo;d been waiting for a
    chance to be nasty. &lsquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve heard a tom-cat sing better.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I moved, and Jack, he was sitting next me, nudged me to keep quiet. The
    chaps didn&rsquo;t like Romany&rsquo;s talk about &rsquo;Possum at all. They
    were all fond of her: she wasn&rsquo;t a pet or a tomboy, for she wasn&rsquo;t
    built that way, but they were fond of her in such a way that they didn&rsquo;t
    like to hear anything said about her. They said nothing for a while, but
    it meant a lot. Perhaps the single men didn&rsquo;t care to speak for fear
    that it would be said that they were gone on Mary. But presently Jimmy Nowlett
    gave a big puff at his pipe and spoke&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose you got bit too in that quarter, Romany?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, she tried it on, but it didn&rsquo;t go,&rsquo; said Romany. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
    met her sort before. She&rsquo;s setting her cap at that Jackaroo now. Some
    girls will run after anything with trousers on,&rsquo; and he stood up.</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes must have felt what was coming, for he grabbed my arm, and whispered, &lsquo;Sit
    still, Joe, damn you! He&rsquo;s too good for you!&rsquo; but I was on my
    feet and facing Romany as if a giant hand had reached down and wrenched me
    off the log and set me there.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a damned crawler, Romany!&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>Little Jimmy Nowlett was between us and the other fellows round us before
    a blow got home. &lsquo;Hold on, you damned fools!&rsquo; they said. &lsquo;Keep
    quiet till we get away from the house!&rsquo; There was a little clear flat
    down by the river and plenty of light there, so we decided to go down there
    and have it out.</p>
  <p>Now I never was a fighting man; I&rsquo;d never learnt to use my hands.
    I scarcely knew how to put them up. Jack often wanted to teach me, but I
    wouldn&rsquo;t bother about it. He&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get into
    a fight some day, Joe, or out of one, and shame me;&rsquo; but I hadn&rsquo;t
    the patience to learn. He&rsquo;d wanted me to take lessons at the station
    after work, but he used to get excited, and I didn&rsquo;t want Mary to see
    him knocking me about. Before he was married Jack was always getting into
    fights&mdash;he generally tackled a better man and got a hiding; but he didn&rsquo;t
    seem to care so long as he made a good show&mdash; though he used to explain
    the thing away from a scientific point of view for weeks after. To tell the
    truth, I had a horror of fighting; I had a horror of being marked about the
    face; I think I&rsquo;d sooner stand off and fight a man with revolvers than
    fight him with fists; and then I think I would say, last thing, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    shoot me in the face!&rsquo; Then again I hated the idea of hitting a man.
    It seemed brutal to me. I was too sensitive and sentimental, and that was
    what the matter was. Jack seemed very serious on it as we walked down to
    the river, and he couldn&rsquo;t help hanging out blue lights.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you let me teach you to use your hands?&rsquo; he
    said. &lsquo;The only chance now is that Romany can&rsquo;t fight after all.
    If you&rsquo;d waited a minute I&rsquo;d have been at him.&rsquo; We were
    a bit behind the rest, and Jack started giving me points about lefts and
    rights, and &lsquo;half-arms&rsquo;, and that sort of thing.  &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
    left-handed, and that&rsquo;s the worst of it,&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;You
    must only make as good a show as you can, and one of us will take him on
    afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But I just heard him and that was all. It was to be my first fight since
    I was a boy, but, somehow, I felt cool about it&mdash;sort of dulled. If
    the chaps had known all they would have set me down as a cur. I thought of
    that, but it didn&rsquo;t make any difference with me then; I knew it was
    a thing they couldn&rsquo;t understand. I knew I was reckoned pretty soft.
    But I knew one thing that they didn&rsquo;t know. I knew that it was going
    to be a fight to a finish, one way or the other. I had more brains and imagination
    than the rest put together, and I suppose that that was the real cause of
    most of my trouble. I kept saying to myself, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have to
    go through with it now, Joe, old man! It&rsquo;s the turning-point of your
    life.&rsquo; If I won the fight, I&rsquo;d set to work and win Mary; if I
    lost, I&rsquo;d leave the district for ever. A man thinks a lot in a flash
    sometimes; I used to get excited over little things, because of the very
    paltriness of them, but I was mostly cool in a crisis&mdash;Jack was the
    reverse. I looked ahead: I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to marry a girl who could
    look back and remember when her husband was beaten by another man&mdash;no
    matter what sort of brute the other man was.</p>
  <p>I never in my life felt so cool about a thing. Jack kept whispering instructions,
    and showing with his hands, up to the last moment, but it was all lost on
    me.</p>
  <p>Looking back, I think there was a bit of romance about it: Mary singing
    under the vines to amuse a Jackaroo dude, and a coward going down to the
    river in the moonlight to fight for her.</p>
  <p>It was very quiet in the little moonlit flat by the river. We took off our
    coats and were ready. There was no swearing or barracking. It seemed an understood
    thing with the men that if I went out first round Jack would fight Romany;
    and if Jack knocked him out somebody else would fight Jack to square matters.
    Jim Bullock wouldn&rsquo;t mind obliging for one; he was a mate of Jack&rsquo;s,
    but he didn&rsquo;t mind who he fought so long as it was for the sake of
    fair play&mdash;or  &lsquo;peace and quietness&rsquo;, as he said. Jim was
    very good-natured. He backed Romany, and of course Jack backed me.</p>
  <p>As far as I could see, all Romany knew about fighting was to jerk one arm
    up in front of his face and duck his head by way of a feint, and then rush
    and lunge out. But he had the weight and strength and length of reach, and
    my first lesson was a very short one. I went down early in the round. But
    it did me good; the blow and the look I&rsquo;d seen in Romany&rsquo;s eyes
    knocked all the sentiment out of me. Jack said nothing,&mdash; he seemed
    to regard it as a hopeless job from the first. Next round I tried to remember
    some things Jack had told me, and made a better show, but I went down in
    the end.</p>
  <p>I felt Jack breathing quick and trembling as he lifted me up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How are you, Joe?&rsquo; he whispered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m all right,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; whispered Jack in a voice as if I was
    going to be hanged, but it would soon be all over. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t
    use his hands much more than you can&mdash;take your time, Joe&mdash;try
    to remember something I told you, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When two men fight who don&rsquo;t know how to use their hands, they stand
    a show of knocking each other about a lot. I got some awful thumps, but mostly
    on the body. Jimmy Nowlett began to get excited and jump round&mdash;he was
    an excitable little fellow.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Fight! you&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; he yelled. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t
    you fight? That ain&rsquo;t fightin&rsquo;. Fight, and don&rsquo;t try to
    murder each other. Use your crimson hands or, by God, I&rsquo;ll chip you!
    Fight, or I&rsquo;ll blanky well bullock-whip the pair of you;&rsquo; then
    his language got awful. They said we went like windmills, and that nearly
    every one of the blows we made was enough to kill a bullock if it had got
    home. Jimmy stopped us once, but they held him back.</p>
  <p>Presently I went down pretty flat, but the blow was well up on the head
    and didn&rsquo;t matter much&mdash;I had a good thick skull. And I had one
    good eye yet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, hit him!&rsquo; whispered Jack&mdash;he was
    trembling like a leaf. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind what I told you. I wish I
    was fighting him myself! Get a blow home, for God&rsquo;s sake! Make a good
    show this round and I&rsquo;ll stop the fight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>That showed how little even Jack, my old mate, understood me.</p>
  <p>I had the Bushman up in me now, and wasn&rsquo;t going to be beaten while
    I could think. I was wonderfully cool, and learning to fight. There&rsquo;s
    nothing like a fight to teach a man. I was thinking fast, and learning more
    in three seconds than Jack&rsquo;s sparring could have taught me in three
    weeks. People think that blows hurt in a fight, but they don&rsquo;t&mdash; not
    till afterwards. I fancy that a fighting man, if he isn&rsquo;t altogether
    an animal, suffers more mentally than he does physically.</p>
  <p>While I was getting my wind I could hear through the moonlight and still
    air the sound of Mary&rsquo;s voice singing up at the house. I thought hard
    into the future, even as I fought. The fight only seemed something that was
    passing.</p>
  <p>I was on my feet again and at it, and presently I lunged out and felt such
    a jar in my arm that I thought it was telescoped. I thought I&rsquo;d put
    out my wrist and elbow. And Romany was lying on the broad of his back.</p>
  <p>I heard Jack draw three breaths of relief in one. He said nothing as he
    straightened me up, but I could feel his heart beating. He said afterwards
    that he didn&rsquo;t speak because he thought a word might spoil it.</p>
  <p>I went down again, but Jack told me afterwards that he&nbsp;<i>felt</i>&nbsp;I
    was all right when he lifted me.</p>
  <p>Then Romany went down, then we fell together, and the chaps separated us.
    I got another knock-down blow in, and was beginning to enjoy the novelty
    of it, when Romany staggered and limped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve done,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve twisted my ankle.&rsquo; He&rsquo;d
    caught his heel against a tuft of grass.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Shake hands,&rsquo; yelled Jimmy Nowlett.</p>
  <p>I stepped forward, but Romany took his coat and limped to his horse.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If yer don&rsquo;t shake hands with Wilson, I&rsquo;ll lamb yer!&rsquo; howled
    Jimmy; but Jack told him to let the man alone, and Romany got on his horse
    somehow and rode off.</p>
  <p>I saw Jim Bullock stoop and pick up something from the grass, and heard
    him swear in surprise. There was some whispering, and presently Jim said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If I thought that, I&rsquo;d kill him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked Jack.</p>
  <p>Jim held up a butcher&rsquo;s knife. It was common for a man to carry a
    butcher&rsquo;s knife in a sheath fastened to his belt.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did you let your man fight with a butcher&rsquo;s knife in his
    belt?&rsquo; asked Jimmy Nowlett.</p>
  <p>But the knife could easily have fallen out when Romany fell, and we decided
    it that way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Any way,&rsquo; said Jimmy Nowlett, &lsquo;if he&rsquo;d stuck Joe
    in hot blood before us all it wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad as if he sneaked up
    and stuck him in the back in the dark. But you&rsquo;d best keep an eye over
    yer shoulder for a year or two, Joe. That chap&rsquo;s got Eye-talian blood
    in him somewhere. And now the best thing you chaps can do is to keep your
    mouth shut and keep all this dark from the gals.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jack hurried me on ahead. He seemed to act queer, and when I glanced at
    him I could have sworn that there was water in his eyes. I said that Jack
    had no sentiment except for himself, but I forgot, and I&rsquo;m sorry I
    said it.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up, you old fool?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Jack, &rsquo;except that I&rsquo;m damned proud
    of you, Joe, you old ass!&rsquo; and he put his arm round my shoulders and
    gave me a shake. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know it was in you, Joe&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have said it before, or listened to any other man say it, but I didn&rsquo;t
    think you had the pluck&mdash; God&rsquo;s truth, I didn&rsquo;t. Come along
    and get your face fixed up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We got into my room quietly, and Jack got a dish of water, and told one
    of the chaps to sneak a piece of fresh beef from somewhere.</p>
  <p>Jack was as proud as a dog with a tin tail as he fussed round me. He fixed
    up my face in the best style he knew, and he knew a good many&mdash; he&rsquo;d
    been mended himself so often.</p>
  <p>While he was at work we heard a sudden hush and a scraping of feet amongst
    the chaps that Jack had kicked out of the room, and a girl&rsquo;s voice
    whispered, &lsquo;Is he hurt? Tell me. I want to know,&mdash; I might be
    able to help.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It made my heart jump, I can tell you. Jack went out at once, and there
    was some whispering. When he came back he seemed wild.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Jack?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, nothing,&rsquo; he said, &rsquo;only that damned slut of a half-caste
    cook overheard some of those blanky fools arguing as to how Romany&rsquo;s
    knife got out of the sheath, and she&rsquo;s put a nice yarn round amongst
    the girls. There&rsquo;s a regular bobbery, but it&rsquo;s all right now.
    Jimmy Nowlett&rsquo;s telling &rsquo;em lies at a great rate.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Presently there was another hush outside, and a saucer with vinegar and
    brown paper was handed in.</p>
  <p>One of the chaps brought some beer and whisky from the pub, and we had a
    quiet little time in my room. Jack wanted to stay all night, but I reminded
    him that his little wife was waiting for him in Solong, so he said he&rsquo;d
    be round early in the morning, and went home.</p>
  <p>I felt the reaction pretty bad. I didn&rsquo;t feel proud of the affair
    at all. I thought it was a low, brutal business all round. Romany was a quiet
    chap after all, and the chaps had no right to chyack him. Perhaps he&rsquo;d
    had a hard life, and carried a big swag of trouble that we didn&rsquo;t know
    anything about. He seemed a lonely man. I&rsquo;d gone through enough myself
    to teach me not to judge men. I made up my mind to tell him how I felt about
    the matter next time we met. Perhaps I made my usual mistake of bothering
    about &lsquo;feelings&rsquo; in another party that hadn&rsquo;t any feelings
    at all&mdash;perhaps I didn&rsquo;t; but it&rsquo;s generally best to chance
    it on the kind side in a case like this. Altogether I felt as if I&rsquo;d
    made another fool of myself and been a weak coward. I drank the rest of the
    beer and went to sleep.</p>
  <p>About daylight I woke and heard Jack&rsquo;s horse on the gravel. He came
    round the back of the buggy-shed and up to my door, and then, suddenly, a
    girl screamed out. I pulled on my trousers and &rsquo;lastic-side boots and
    hurried out. It was Mary herself, dressed, and sitting on an old stone step
    at the back of the kitchen with her face in her hands, and Jack was off his
    horse and stooping by her side with his hand on her shoulder. She kept saying, &lsquo;I
    thought you were&mdash;&mdash;! I thought you were&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; I
    didn&rsquo;t catch the name. An old single-barrel, muzzle-loader shot-gun
    was lying in the grass at her feet. It was the gun they used to keep loaded
    and hanging in straps in a room of the kitchen ready for a shot at a cunning
    old hawk that they called &lsquo;&rsquo;Tarnal Death&rsquo;, and that used
    to be always after the chickens.</p>
  <p>When Mary lifted her face it was as white as note-paper, and her eyes seemed
    to grow wilder when she caught sight of me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, you did frighten me, Mr Barnes,&rsquo; she gasped. Then she gave
    a little ghost of a laugh and stood up, and some colour came back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a little fool!&rsquo; she said quickly. &lsquo;I thought
    I heard old  &rsquo;Tarnal Death at the chickens, and I thought it would
    be a great thing if I got the gun and brought him down; so I got up and dressed
    quietly so as not to wake Sarah. And then you came round the corner and frightened
    me. I don&rsquo;t know what you must think of me, Mr Barnes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said Jack. &lsquo;You go and have a sleep, or
    you won&rsquo;t be able to dance to-night. Never mind the gun&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    put that away.&rsquo; And he steered her round to the door of her room off
    the brick verandah where she slept with one of the other girls.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s a rum start!&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, it is,&rsquo; said Jack; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s very funny. Well,
    how&rsquo;s your face this morning, Joe?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed a lot more serious than usual.</p>
  <p>We were hard at work all the morning cleaning out the big wool-shed and
    getting it ready for the dance, hanging hoops for the candles, making seats, &amp;c.
    I kept out of sight of the girls as much as I could. One side of my face
    was a sight and the other wasn&rsquo;t too classical. I felt as if I had
    been stung by a swarm of bees.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re a fresh, sweet-scented beauty now, and no mistake, Joe,&rsquo;  said
    Jimmy Nowlett&mdash;he was going to play the accordion that night. &lsquo;You
    ought to fetch the girls now, Joe. But never mind, your face&rsquo;ll go
    down in about three weeks. My lower jaw is crooked yet; but that fight straightened
    my nose, that had been knocked crooked when I was a boy&mdash;so I didn&rsquo;t
    lose much beauty by it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When we&rsquo;d done in the shed, Jack took me aside and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe! if you won&rsquo;t come to the dance to-night&mdash;and
    I can&rsquo;t say you&rsquo;d ornament it&mdash;I tell you what you&rsquo;ll
    do. You get little Mary away on the quiet and take her out for a stroll&mdash;and
    act like a man. The job&rsquo;s finished now, and you won&rsquo;t get another
    chance like this.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But how am I to get her out?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never you mind. You be mooching round down by the big peppermint-tree
    near the river-gate, say about half-past ten.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What good&rsquo;ll that do?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never you mind. You just do as you&rsquo;re told, that&rsquo;s all
    you&rsquo;ve got to do,&rsquo; said Jack, and he went home to get dressed
    and bring his wife.</p>
  <p>After the dancing started that night I had a peep in once or twice. The
    first time I saw Mary dancing with Jack, and looking serious; and the second
    time she was dancing with the blarsted Jackaroo dude, and looking excited
    and happy. I noticed that some of the girls, that I could see sitting on
    a stool along the opposite wall, whispered, and gave Mary black looks as
    the Jackaroo swung her past. It struck me pretty forcibly that I should have
    taken fighting lessons from him instead of from poor Romany. I went away
    and walked about four miles down the river road, getting out of the way into
    the Bush whenever I saw any chap riding along. I thought of poor Romany and
    wondered where he was, and thought that there wasn&rsquo;t much to choose
    between us as far as happiness was concerned. Perhaps he was walking by himself
    in the Bush, and feeling like I did. I wished I could shake hands with him.</p>
  <p>But somehow, about half-past ten, I drifted back to the river slip-rails
    and leant over them, in the shadow of the peppermint-tree, looking at the
    rows of river-willows in the moonlight. I didn&rsquo;t expect anything, in
    spite of what Jack said.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t like the idea of hanging myself: I&rsquo;d been with a party
    who found a man hanging in the Bush, and it was no place for a woman round
    where he was. And I&rsquo;d helped drag two bodies out of the Cudgeegong
    river in a flood, and they weren&rsquo;t sleeping beauties. I thought it
    was a pity that a chap couldn&rsquo;t lie down on a grassy bank in a graceful
    position in the moonlight and die just by thinking of it&mdash;and die with
    his eyes and mouth shut. But then I remembered that I wouldn&rsquo;t make
    a beautiful corpse, anyway it went, with the face I had on me.</p>
  <p>I was just getting comfortably miserable when I heard a step behind me,
    and my heart gave a jump. And I gave a start too.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, is that you, Mr Wilson?&rsquo; said a timid little voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Is that you, Mary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And she said yes. It was the first time I called her Mary, but she did not
    seem to notice it.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did I frighten you?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;just a little,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    know there was any one&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; then she stopped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you dancing?&rsquo; I asked her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m tired,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It was too hot in the
    wool-shed. I thought I&rsquo;d like to come out and get my head cool and
    be quiet a little while.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it must be hot in the wool-shed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She stood looking out over the willows. Presently she said, &lsquo;It must
    be very dull for you, Mr Wilson&mdash;you must feel lonely. Mr Barnes said&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;  Then
    she gave a little gasp and stopped&mdash; as if she was just going to put
    her foot in it.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How beautiful the moonlight looks on the willows!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;doesn&rsquo;t it? Supposing we have a
    stroll by the river.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, thank you, Mr Wilson. I&rsquo;d like it very much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t notice it then, but, now I come to think of it, it was a
    beautiful scene: there was a horseshoe of high blue hills round behind the
    house, with the river running round under the slopes, and in front was a
    rounded hill covered with pines, and pine ridges, and a soft blue peak away
    over the ridges ever so far in the distance.</p>
  <p>I had a handkerchief over the worst of my face, and kept the best side turned
    to her. We walked down by the river, and didn&rsquo;t say anything for a
    good while. I was thinking hard. We came to a white smooth log in a quiet
    place out of sight of the house.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Suppose we sit down for a while, Mary,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If you like, Mr Wilson,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>There was about a foot of log between us.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What a beautiful night!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Presently she said, &lsquo;I suppose you know I&rsquo;m going away next
    month, Mr Wilson?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I felt suddenly empty. &lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
    that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I thought you knew. I&rsquo;m going
    to try and get into the hospital to be trained for a nurse, and if that doesn&rsquo;t
    come off I&rsquo;ll get a place as assistant public-school teacher.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t say anything for a good while.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I suppose you won&rsquo;t be sorry to go, Miss Brand?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Everybody&rsquo;s
    been so kind to me here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She sat looking straight before her, and I fancied her eyes glistened. I
    put my arm round her shoulders, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to notice it. In
    fact, I scarcely noticed it myself at the time.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So you think you&rsquo;ll be sorry to go away?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Mr Wilson. I suppose I&rsquo;ll fret for a while. It&rsquo;s
    been my home, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I pressed my hand on her shoulder, just a little, so as she couldn&rsquo;t
    pretend not to know it was there. But she didn&rsquo;t seem to notice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ah, well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll be on the wallaby
    again next week.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you, Mr Wilson?&rsquo; she said. Her voice seemed very soft.</p>
  <p>I slipped my arm round her waist, under her arm. My heart was going like
    clockwork now.</p>
  <p>Presently she said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s time to go back now, Mr Wilson?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s plenty of time!&rsquo; I said. I shifted up, and
    put my arm farther round, and held her closer. She sat straight up, looking
    right in front of her, but she began to breathe hard.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Call me Joe,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
    think it would be right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So I just turned her face round and kissed her. She clung to me and cried.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Mary?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>She only held me tighter and cried.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Mary?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you well? Ain&rsquo;t
    you happy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Joe,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very happy.&rsquo; Then
    she said, &lsquo;Oh, your poor face! Can&rsquo;t I do anything for it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right. My face doesn&rsquo;t
    hurt me a bit now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she didn&rsquo;t seem right.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Mary?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Are you tired? You didn&rsquo;t
    sleep last night&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Then I got an inspiration.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what were you doing out with the gun
    this morning?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And after some coaxing it all came out, a bit hysterical.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep&mdash;I was frightened. Oh! I had such a terrible
    dream about you, Joe! I thought Romany came back and got into your room and
    stabbed you with his knife. I got up and dressed, and about daybreak I heard
    a horse at the gate; then I got the gun down from the wall&mdash; and&mdash;and
    Mr Barnes came round the corner and frightened me. He&rsquo;s something like
    Romany, you know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then I got as much of her as I could into my arms.</p>
  <p>And, oh, but wasn&rsquo;t I happy walking home with Mary that night! She
    was too little for me to put my arm round her waist, so I put it round her
    shoulder, and that felt just as good. I remember I asked her who&rsquo;d
    cleaned up my room and washed my things, but she wouldn&rsquo;t tell.</p>
  <p>She wouldn&rsquo;t go back to the dance yet; she said she&rsquo;d go into
    her room and rest a while. There was no one near the old verandah; and when
    she stood on the end of the floor she was just on a level with my shoulder.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;put your arms round my neck and
    kiss me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She put her arms round my neck, but she didn&rsquo;t kiss me; she only hid
    her face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kiss me, Mary!&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like to,&rsquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not, Mary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then I felt her crying or laughing, or half crying and half laughing. I&rsquo;m
    not sure to this day which it was.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why won&rsquo;t you kiss me, Mary? Don&rsquo;t you love me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;because&mdash;because I&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s right for&mdash;for a girl
    to&mdash;to kiss a man unless she&rsquo;s going to be his wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then it dawned on me! I&rsquo;d forgot all about proposing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;would you marry a chap like me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And that was all right.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Next morning Mary cleared out my room and sorted out my things, and didn&rsquo;t
    take the slightest notice of the other girls&rsquo; astonishment.</p>
  <p>But she made me promise to speak to old Black, and I did the same evening.
    I found him sitting on the log by the fence, having a yarn on the quiet with
    an old Bushman; and when the old Bushman got up and went away, I sat down.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Joe,&rsquo; said Black, &lsquo;I see somebody&rsquo;s been
    spoiling your face for the dance.&rsquo; And after a bit he said, &lsquo;Well,
    Joe, what is it? Do you want another job? If you do, you&rsquo;ll have to
    ask Mrs Black, or Bob&rsquo; (Bob was his eldest son); &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
    managing the station for me now, you know.&rsquo; He could be bitter sometimes
    in his quiet way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s not that, Boss.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what is it, Joe?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;well the fact is, I want little Mary.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He puffed at his pipe for a long time, then I thought he spoke.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What did you say, Boss?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Nothing, Joe,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I was going to say a lot, but
    it wouldn&rsquo;t be any use. My father used to say a lot to me before I
    was married.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I waited a good while for him to speak.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Boss,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;what about Mary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! I suppose that&rsquo;s all right, Joe,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I&mdash;I
    beg your pardon. I got thinking of the days when I was courting Mrs Black.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BrightensSisterInLaw"></a>Brighten&rsquo;s Sister-In-Law</b></h2>
  <p>Jim&nbsp;was born on Gulgong, New South Wales. We used to say &lsquo;on&rsquo;  Gulgong&mdash;and
    old diggers still talked of being &lsquo;on th&rsquo; Gulgong&rsquo;&mdash; though
    the goldfield there had been worked out for years, and the place was only
    a dusty little pastoral town in the scrubs. Gulgong was about the last of
    the great alluvial &lsquo;rushes&rsquo; of the &lsquo;roaring days&rsquo;&mdash;and
    dreary and dismal enough it looked when I was there. The expression &lsquo;on&rsquo; came
    from being on the &lsquo;diggings&rsquo; or goldfield&mdash;the workings
    or the goldfield was all underneath, of course, so we lived (or starved)
    on them&mdash;not in nor at &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>Mary and I had been married about two years when Jim came&mdash;&mdash; His
    name wasn&rsquo;t &lsquo;Jim&rsquo;, by the way, it was &lsquo;John Henry&rsquo;,
    after an uncle godfather; but we called him Jim from the first&mdash; (and
    before it)&mdash;because Jim was a popular Bush name, and most of my old
    mates were Jims. The Bush is full of good-hearted scamps called Jim.</p>
  <p>We lived in an old weather-board shanty that had been a sly-grog-shop, and
    the Lord knows what else! in the palmy days of Gulgong; and I did a bit of
    digging (&lsquo;fossicking&rsquo;, rather), a bit of shearing, a bit of fencing,
    a bit of Bush-carpentering, tank-sinking,&mdash;anything, just to keep the
    billy boiling.</p>
  <p>We had a lot of trouble with Jim with his teeth. He was bad with every one
    of them, and we had most of them lanced&mdash; couldn&rsquo;t pull him through
    without. I remember we got one lanced and the gum healed over before the
    tooth came through, and we had to get it cut again. He was a plucky little
    chap, and after the first time he never whimpered when the doctor was lancing
    his gum: he used to say &lsquo;tar&rsquo; afterwards, and want to bring the
    lance home with him.</p>
  <p>The first turn we got with Jim was the worst. I had had the wife and Jim
    out camping with me in a tent at a dam I was making at Cattle Creek; I had
    two men working for me, and a boy to drive one of the tip-drays, and I took
    Mary out to cook for us. And it was lucky for us that the contract was finished
    and we got back to Gulgong, and within reach of a doctor, the day we did.
    We were just camping in the house, with our goods and chattels anyhow, for
    the night; and we were hardly back home an hour when Jim took convulsions
    for the first time.</p>
  <p>Did you ever see a child in convulsions? You wouldn&rsquo;t want to see
    it again: it plays the devil with a man&rsquo;s nerves. I&rsquo;d got the
    beds fixed up on the floor, and the billies on the fire&mdash;I was going
    to make some tea, and put a piece of corned beef on to boil over night&mdash;when
    Jim (he&rsquo;d been queer all day, and his mother was trying to hush him
    to sleep)&mdash; Jim, he screamed out twice. He&rsquo;d been crying a good
    deal, and I was dog-tired and worried (over some money a man owed me) or
    I&rsquo;d have noticed at once that there was something unusual in the way
    the child cried out: as it was I didn&rsquo;t turn round till Mary screamed &lsquo;Joe!
    Joe!&rsquo; You know how a woman cries out when her child is in danger or
    dying&mdash;short, and sharp, and terrible. &lsquo;Joe! Look! look! Oh, my
    God! our child! Get the bath, quick! quick! it&rsquo;s convulsions!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jim was bent back like a bow, stiff as a bullock-yoke, in his mother&rsquo;s
    arms, and his eyeballs were turned up and fixed&mdash;a thing I saw twice
    afterwards, and don&rsquo;t want ever to see again.</p>
  <p>I was falling over things getting the tub and the hot water, when the woman
    who lived next door rushed in. She called to her husband to run for the doctor,
    and before the doctor came she and Mary had got Jim into a hot bath and pulled
    him through.</p>
  <p>The neighbour woman made me up a shake-down in another room, and stayed
    with Mary that night; but it was a long while before I got Jim and Mary&rsquo;s
    screams out of my head and fell asleep.</p>
  <p>You may depend I kept the fire in, and a bucket of water hot over it, for
    a good many nights after that; but (it always happens like this) there came
    a night, when the fright had worn off, when I was too tired to bother about
    the fire, and that night Jim took us by surprise. Our wood-heap was done,
    and I broke up a new chair to get a fire, and had to run a quarter of a mile
    for water; but this turn wasn&rsquo;t so bad as the first, and we pulled
    him through.</p>
  <p>You never saw a child in convulsions? Well, you don&rsquo;t want to. It
    must be only a matter of seconds, but it seems long minutes; and half an
    hour afterwards the child might be laughing and playing with you, or stretched
    out dead. It shook me up a lot. I was always pretty high-strung and sensitive.
    After Jim took the first fit, every time he cried, or turned over, or stretched
    out in the night, I&rsquo;d jump: I was always feeling his forehead in the
    dark to see if he was feverish, or feeling his limbs to see if he was &lsquo;limp&rsquo; yet.
    Mary and I often laughed about it&mdash;afterwards. I tried sleeping in another
    room, but for nights after Jim&rsquo;s first attack I&rsquo;d be just dozing
    off into a sound sleep, when I&rsquo;d hear him scream, as plain as could
    be, and I&rsquo;d hear Mary cry,  &lsquo;Joe!&mdash;Joe!&rsquo;&mdash;short,
    sharp, and terrible&mdash; and I&rsquo;d be up and into their room like a
    shot, only to find them sleeping peacefully. Then I&rsquo;d feel Jim&rsquo;s
    head and his breathing for signs of convulsions, see to the fire and water,
    and go back to bed and try to sleep. For the first few nights I was like
    that all night, and I&rsquo;d feel relieved when daylight came. I&rsquo;d
    be in first thing to see if they were all right; then I&rsquo;d sleep till
    dinner-time if it was Sunday or I had no work. But then I was run down about
    that time: I was worried about some money for a wool-shed I put up and never
    got paid for; and, besides, I&rsquo;d been pretty wild before I met Mary.</p>
  <p>I was fighting hard then&mdash;struggling for something better. Both Mary
    and I were born to better things, and that&rsquo;s what made the life so
    hard for us.</p>
  <p>Jim got on all right for a while: we used to watch him well, and have his
    teeth lanced in time.</p>
  <p>It used to hurt and worry me to see how&mdash;just as he was getting fat
    and rosy and like a natural happy child, and I&rsquo;d feel proud to take
    him out&mdash; a tooth would come along, and he&rsquo;d get thin and white
    and pale and bigger-eyed and old-fashioned. We&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll
    be safe when he gets his eye-teeth&rsquo;: but he didn&rsquo;t get them till
    he was two; then, &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll be safe when he gets his two-year-old
    teeth&rsquo;: they didn&rsquo;t come till he was going on for three.</p>
  <p>He was a wonderful little chap&mdash;Yes, I know all about parents thinking
    that their child is the best in the world. If your boy is small for his age,
    friends will say that small children make big men; that he&rsquo;s a very
    bright, intelligent child, and that it&rsquo;s better to have a bright, intelligent
    child than a big, sleepy lump of fat. And if your boy is dull and sleepy,
    they say that the dullest boys make the cleverest men&mdash; and all the
    rest of it. I never took any notice of that sort of clatter&mdash; took it
    for what it was worth; but, all the same, I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw
    such a child as Jim was when he turned two. He was everybody&rsquo;s favourite.
    They spoilt him rather. I had my own ideas about bringing up a child. I reckoned
    Mary was too soft with Jim. She&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Put that&rsquo; (whatever
    it was) &rsquo;out of Jim&rsquo;s reach, will you, Joe?&rsquo; and I&rsquo;d
    say, &lsquo;No! leave it there, and make him understand he&rsquo;s not to
    have it. Make him have his meals without any nonsense, and go to bed at a
    regular hour,&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say. Mary and I had many a breeze over Jim.
    She&rsquo;d say that I forgot he was only a baby: but I held that a baby
    could be trained from the first week; and I believe I was right.</p>
  <p>But, after all, what are you to do? You&rsquo;ll see a boy that was brought
    up strict turn out a scamp; and another that was dragged up anyhow (by the
    hair of the head, as the saying is) turn out well. Then, again, when a child
    is delicate&mdash;and you might lose him any day&mdash; you don&rsquo;t like
    to spank him, though he might be turning out a little fiend, as delicate
    children often do. Suppose you gave a child a hammering, and the same night
    he took convulsions, or something, and died&mdash; how&rsquo;d you feel about
    it? You never know what a child is going to take, any more than you can tell
    what some women are going to say or do.</p>
  <p>I was very fond of Jim, and we were great chums. Sometimes I&rsquo;d sit
    and wonder what the deuce he was thinking about, and often, the way he talked,
    he&rsquo;d make me uneasy. When he was two he wanted a pipe above all things,
    and I&rsquo;d get him a clean new clay and he&rsquo;d sit by my side, on
    the edge of the verandah, or on a log of the wood-heap, in the cool of the
    evening, and suck away at his pipe, and try to spit when he saw me do it.
    He seemed to understand that a cold empty pipe wasn&rsquo;t quite the thing,
    yet to have the sense to know that he couldn&rsquo;t smoke tobacco yet: he
    made the best he could of things. And if he broke a clay pipe he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have a new one, and there&rsquo;d be a row; the old one had to be mended
    up, somehow, with string or wire. If I got my hair cut, he&rsquo;d want his
    cut too; and it always troubled him to see me shave&mdash;as if he thought
    there must be something wrong somewhere, else he ought to have to be shaved
    too. I lathered him one day, and pretended to shave him: he sat through it
    as solemn as an owl, but didn&rsquo;t seem to appreciate it&mdash;perhaps
    he had sense enough to know that it couldn&rsquo;t possibly be the real thing.
    He felt his face, looked very hard at the lather I scraped off, and whimpered, &lsquo;No
    blood, daddy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I used to cut myself a good deal: I was always impatient over shaving.</p>
  <p>Then he went in to interview his mother about it. She understood his lingo
    better than I did.</p>
  <p>But I wasn&rsquo;t always at ease with him. Sometimes he&rsquo;d sit looking
    into the fire, with his head on one side, and I&rsquo;d watch him and wonder
    what he was thinking about (I might as well have wondered what a Chinaman
    was thinking about) till he seemed at least twenty years older than me: sometimes,
    when I moved or spoke, he&rsquo;d glance round just as if to see what that
    old fool of a dadda of his was doing now.</p>
  <p>I used to have a fancy that there was something Eastern, or Asiatic&mdash; something
    older than our civilisation or religion&mdash; about old-fashioned children.
    Once I started to explain my idea to a woman I thought would understand&mdash;and
    as it happened she had an old-fashioned child, with very slant eyes&mdash; a
    little tartar he was too. I suppose it was the sight of him that unconsciously
    reminded me of my infernal theory, and set me off on it, without warning
    me. Anyhow, it got me mixed up in an awful row with the woman and her husband&mdash;and
    all their tribe. It wasn&rsquo;t an easy thing to explain myself out of it,
    and the row hasn&rsquo;t been fixed up yet. There were some Chinamen in the
    district.</p>
  <p>I took a good-size fencing contract, the frontage of a ten-mile paddock,
    near Gulgong, and did well out of it. The railway had got as far as the Cudgeegong
    river&mdash;some twenty miles from Gulgong and two hundred from the coast&mdash;and &lsquo;carrying&rsquo; was
    good then. I had a couple of draught-horses, that I worked in the tip-drays
    when I was tank-sinking, and one or two others running in the Bush. I bought
    a broken-down waggon cheap, tinkered it up myself&mdash;  christened it &lsquo;The
    Same Old Thing&rsquo;&mdash;and started carrying from the railway terminus
    through Gulgong and along the bush roads and tracks that branch out fanlike
    through the scrubs to the one-pub towns and sheep and cattle stations out
    there in the howling wilderness. It wasn&rsquo;t much of a team. There were
    the two heavy horses for &lsquo;shafters&rsquo;; a stunted colt, that I&rsquo;d
    bought out of the pound for thirty shillings; a light, spring-cart horse;
    an old grey mare, with points like a big red-and-white Australian store bullock,
    and with the grit of an old washerwoman to work; and a horse that had spanked
    along in Cob &amp; Co.&rsquo;s mail-coach in his time. I had a couple there
    that didn&rsquo;t belong to me: I worked them for the feeding of them in
    the dry weather. And I had all sorts of harness, that I mended and fixed
    up myself. It was a mixed team, but I took light stuff, got through pretty
    quick, and freight rates were high. So I got along.</p>
  <p>Before this, whenever I made a few pounds I&rsquo;d sink a shaft somewhere,
    prospecting for gold; but Mary never let me rest till she talked me out of
    that.</p>
  <p>I made up my mind to take on a small selection farm&mdash; that an old mate
    of mine had fenced in and cleared, and afterwards chucked up&mdash;about
    thirty miles out west of Gulgong, at a place called Lahey&rsquo;s Creek.
    (The places were all called Lahey&rsquo;s Creek, or Spicer&rsquo;s Flat,
    or Murphy&rsquo;s Flat, or Ryan&rsquo;s Crossing, or some such name&mdash; round
    there.) I reckoned I&rsquo;d have a run for the horses and be able to grow
    a bit of feed. I always had a dread of taking Mary and the children too far
    away from a doctor&mdash;or a good woman neighbour; but there were some people
    came to live on Lahey&rsquo;s Creek, and besides, there was a young brother
    of Mary&rsquo;s&mdash;a young scamp (his name was Jim, too, and we called
    him  &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo; at first to make room for our Jim&mdash;he hated
    the name &lsquo;Jimmy&rsquo; or James). He came to live with us&mdash;without
    asking&mdash;and I thought he&rsquo;d find enough work at Lahey&rsquo;s Creek
    to keep him out of mischief. He wasn&rsquo;t to be depended on much&mdash;he
    thought nothing of riding off, five hundred miles or so, &lsquo;to have a
    look at the country&rsquo;&mdash; but he was fond of Mary, and he&rsquo;d
    stay by her till I got some one else to keep her company while I was on the
    road. He would be a protection against &lsquo;sundowners&rsquo; or any shearers
    who happened to wander that way in the  &lsquo;D.T.&rsquo;s&rsquo; after
    a spree. Mary had a married sister come to live at Gulgong just before we
    left, and nothing would suit her and her husband but we must leave little
    Jim with them for a month or so&mdash; till we got settled down at Lahey&rsquo;s
    Creek. They were newly married.</p>
  <p>Mary was to have driven into Gulgong, in the spring-cart, at the end of
    the month, and taken Jim home; but when the time came she wasn&rsquo;t too
    well&mdash;and, besides, the tyres of the cart were loose, and I hadn&rsquo;t
    time to get them cut, so we let Jim&rsquo;s time run on a week or so longer,
    till I happened to come out through Gulgong from the river with a small load
    of flour for Lahey&rsquo;s Creek way. The roads were good, the weather grand&mdash;no
    chance of it raining, and I had a spare tarpaulin if it did&mdash;I would
    only camp out one night; so I decided to take Jim home with me.</p>
  <p>Jim was turning three then, and he was a cure. He was so old-fashioned that
    he used to frighten me sometimes&mdash;I&rsquo;d almost think that there
    was something supernatural about him; though, of course, I never took any
    notice of that rot about some children being too old-fashioned to live. There&rsquo;s
    always the ghoulish old hag (and some not so old nor haggish either) who&rsquo;ll
    come round and shake up young parents with such croaks as, &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll
    never rear that child&mdash;he&rsquo;s too bright for his age.&rsquo; To
    the devil with them! I say.</p>
  <p>But I really thought that Jim was too intelligent for his age, and I often
    told Mary that he ought to be kept back, and not let talk too much to old
    diggers and long lanky jokers of Bushmen who rode in and hung their horses
    outside my place on Sunday afternoons.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t believe in parents talking about their own children everlastingly&mdash; you
    get sick of hearing them; and their kids are generally little devils, and
    turn out larrikins as likely as not.</p>
  <p>But, for all that, I really think that Jim, when he was three years old,
    was the most wonderful little chap, in every way, that I ever saw.</p>
  <p>For the first hour or so, along the road, he was telling me all about his
    adventures at his auntie&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But they spoilt me too much, dad,&rsquo; he said, as solemn as a
    native bear. &lsquo;An&rsquo; besides, a boy ought to stick to his parrans!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was taking out a cattle-pup for a drover I knew, and the pup took up a
    good deal of Jim&rsquo;s time.</p>
  <p>Sometimes he&rsquo;d jolt me, the way he talked; and other times I&rsquo;d
    have to turn away my head and cough, or shout at the horses, to keep from
    laughing outright. And once, when I was taken that way, he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you jerking your shoulders and coughing, and grunting, and
    going on that way for, dad? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me something?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell you what, Jim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell me some talk.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So I told him all the talk I could think of. And I had to brighten up, I
    can tell you, and not draw too much on my imagination&mdash; for Jim was
    a terror at cross-examination when the fit took him; and he didn&rsquo;t
    think twice about telling you when he thought you were talking nonsense.
    Once he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad you took me home with you, dad. You&rsquo;ll get to
    know Jim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get to know Jim.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But don&rsquo;t I know you already?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, you don&rsquo;t. You never has time to know Jim at home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And, looking back, I saw that it was cruel true. I had known in my heart
    all along that this was the truth; but it came to me like a blow from Jim.
    You see, it had been a hard struggle for the last year or so; and when I
    was home for a day or two I was generally too busy, or too tired and worried,
    or full of schemes for the future, to take much notice of Jim. Mary used
    to speak to me about it sometimes. &lsquo;You never take notice of the child,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
    say. &lsquo;You could surely find a few minutes of an evening. What&rsquo;s
    the use of always worrying and brooding? Your brain will go with a snap some
    day, and, if you get over it, it will teach you a lesson. You&rsquo;ll be
    an old man, and Jim a young one, before you realise that you had a child
    once. Then it will be too late.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This sort of talk from Mary always bored me and made me impatient with her,
    because I knew it all too well. I never worried for myself&mdash; only for
    Mary and the children. And often, as the days went by, I said to myself, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take more notice of Jim and give Mary more of my time, just as soon as I
    can see things clear ahead a bit.&rsquo; And the hard days went on, and the
    weeks, and the months, and the years&mdash;&mdash; Ah, well!</p>
  <p>Mary used to say, when things would get worse, &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you
    talk to me, Joe? Why don&rsquo;t you tell me your thoughts, instead of shutting
    yourself up in yourself and brooding&mdash;eating your heart out? It&rsquo;s
    hard for me: I get to think you&rsquo;re tired of me, and selfish. I might
    be cross and speak sharp to you when you are in trouble. How am I to know,
    if you don&rsquo;t tell me?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d understand.</p>
  <p>And so, getting acquainted, and chumming and dozing, with the gums closing
    over our heads here and there, and the ragged patches of sunlight and shade
    passing up, over the horses, over us, on the front of the load, over the
    load, and down on to the white, dusty road again&mdash; Jim and I got along
    the lonely Bush road and over the ridges, some fifteen miles before sunset,
    and camped at Ryan&rsquo;s Crossing on Sandy Creek for the night. I got the
    horses out and took the harness off. Jim wanted badly to help me, but I made
    him stay on the load; for one of the horses&mdash;a vicious, red-eyed chestnut&mdash;was
    a kicker: he&rsquo;d broken a man&rsquo;s leg. I got the feed-bags stretched
    across the shafts, and the chaff-and-corn into them; and there stood the
    horses all round with their rumps north, south, and west, and their heads
    between the shafts, munching and switching their tails. We use double shafts,
    you know, for horse-teams&mdash;two pairs side by side,&mdash;and prop them
    up, and stretch bags between them, letting the bags sag to serve as feed-boxes.
    I threw the spare tarpaulin over the wheels on one side, letting about half
    of it lie on the ground in case of damp, and so making a floor and a break-wind.
    I threw down bags and the blankets and  &rsquo;possum rug against the wheel
    to make a camp for Jim and the cattle-pup, and got a gin-case we used for
    a tucker-box, the frying-pan and billy down, and made a good fire at a log
    close handy, and soon everything was comfortable. Ryan&rsquo;s Crossing was
    a grand camp. I stood with my pipe in my mouth, my hands behind my back,
    and my back to the fire, and took the country in.</p>
  <p>Reedy Creek came down along a western spur of the range: the banks here
    were deep and green, and the water ran clear over the granite bars, boulders,
    and gravel. Behind us was a dreary flat covered with those gnarled, grey-barked,
    dry-rotted &lsquo;native apple-trees&rsquo; (about as much like apple-trees
    as the native bear is like any other), and a nasty bit of sand-dusty road
    that I was always glad to get over in wet weather. To the left on our side
    of the creek were reedy marshes, with frogs croaking, and across the creek
    the dark box-scrub-covered ridges ended in steep &lsquo;sidings&rsquo; coming
    down to the creek-bank, and to the main road that skirted them, running on
    west up over a  &lsquo;saddle&rsquo; in the ridges and on towards Dubbo.
    The road by Lahey&rsquo;s Creek to a place called Cobborah branched off,
    through dreary apple-tree and stringy-bark flats, to the left, just beyond
    the crossing: all these fanlike branch tracks from the Cudgeegong were inside
    a big horse-shoe in the Great Western Line, and so they gave small carriers
    a chance, now that Cob &amp; Co.&rsquo;s coaches and the big teams and vans
    had shifted out of the main western terminus. There were tall she-oaks all
    along the creek, and a clump of big ones over a deep water-hole just above
    the crossing. The creek oaks have rough barked trunks, like English elms,
    but are much taller, and higher to the branches&mdash;and the leaves are
    reedy; Kendel, the Australian poet, calls them the &lsquo;she-oak harps Aeolian&rsquo;.
    Those trees are always sigh-sigh-sighing&mdash;more of a sigh than a sough
    or the &lsquo;whoosh&rsquo; of gum-trees in the wind. You always hear them
    sighing, even when you can&rsquo;t feel any wind. It&rsquo;s the same with
    telegraph wires: put your head against a telegraph-post on a dead, still
    day, and you&rsquo;ll hear and feel the far-away roar of the wires. But then
    the oaks are not connected with the distance, where there might be wind;
    and they don&rsquo;t <i>roar</i> in a gale, only sigh louder and softer according
    to the wind, and never seem to go above or below a certain pitch,&mdash;like
    a big harp with all the strings the same. I used to have a theory that those
    creek oaks got the wind&rsquo;s voice telephoned to them, so to speak, through
    the ground.</p>
  <p>I happened to look down, and there was Jim (I thought he was on the tarpaulin,
    playing with the pup): he was standing close beside me with his legs wide
    apart, his hands behind his back, and his back to the fire.</p>
  <p>He held his head a little on one side, and there was such an old, old, wise
    expression in his big brown eyes&mdash;just as if he&rsquo;d been a child
    for a hundred years or so, or as though he were listening to those oaks and
    understanding them in a fatherly sort of way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dad!&rsquo; he said presently&mdash;&lsquo;Dad! do you think I&rsquo;ll
    ever grow up to be a man?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wh&mdash;why, Jim?&rsquo; I gasped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because I don&rsquo;t want to.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything against this. It made me uneasy. But
    I remembered&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;used to have a childish dread of growing
    up to be a man.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jim,&rsquo; I said, to break the silence, &lsquo;do you hear what
    the she-oaks say?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. Is they talking?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said, without thinking.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is they saying?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>I took the bucket and went down to the creek for some water for tea. I thought
    Jim would follow with a little tin billy he had, but he didn&rsquo;t: when
    I got back to the fire he was again on the &rsquo;possum rug, comforting
    the pup. I fried some bacon and eggs that I&rsquo;d brought out with me.
    Jim sang out from the waggon&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t cook too much, dad&mdash;I mightn&rsquo;t be hungry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I got the tin plates and pint-pots and things out on a clean new flour-bag,
    in honour of Jim, and dished up. He was leaning back on the rug looking at
    the pup in a listless sort of way. I reckoned he was tired out, and pulled
    the gin-case up close to him for a table and put his plate on it. But he
    only tried a mouthful or two, and then he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t hungry, dad! You&rsquo;ll have to eat it all.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It made me uneasy&mdash;I never liked to see a child of mine turn from his
    food. They had given him some tinned salmon in Gulgong, and I was afraid
    that that was upsetting him. I was always against tinned muck.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sick, Jim?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, dad, I ain&rsquo;t sick; I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s the
    matter with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have some tea, sonny?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, dad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I gave him some tea, with some milk in it that I&rsquo;d brought in a bottle
    from his aunt&rsquo;s for him. He took a sip or two and then put the pint-pot
    on the gin-case.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jim&rsquo;s tired, dad,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I made him lie down while I fixed up a camp for the night. It had turned
    a bit chilly, so I let the big tarpaulin down all round&mdash; it was made
    to cover a high load, the flour in the waggon didn&rsquo;t come above the
    rail, so the tarpaulin came down well on to the ground. I fixed Jim up a
    comfortable bed under the tail-end of the waggon: when I went to lift him
    in he was lying back, looking up at the stars in a half-dreamy, half-fascinated
    way that I didn&rsquo;t like. Whenever Jim was extra old-fashioned, or affectionate,
    there was danger.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you feel now, sonny?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It seemed a minute before he heard me and turned from the stars.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jim&rsquo;s better, dad.&rsquo; Then he said something like, &lsquo;The
    stars are looking at me.&rsquo; I thought he was half asleep. I took off
    his jacket and boots, and carried him in under the waggon and made him comfortable
    for the night.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kiss me &rsquo;night-night, daddy,&rsquo; he said.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d rather he hadn&rsquo;t asked me&mdash;it was a bad sign. As I
    was going to the fire he called me back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Jim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Get me my things and the cattle-pup, please, daddy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was scared now. His things were some toys and rubbish he&rsquo;d brought
    from Gulgong, and I remembered, the last time he had convulsions, he took
    all his toys and a kitten to bed with him. And &lsquo;&rsquo;night-night&rsquo; and &lsquo;daddy&rsquo;  were
    two-year-old language to Jim. I&rsquo;d thought he&rsquo;d forgotten those
    words&mdash; he seemed to be going back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you quite warm enough, Jim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, dad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I started to walk up and down&mdash;I always did this when I was extra worried.</p>
  <p>I was frightened now about Jim, though I tried to hide the fact from myself.
    Presently he called me again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Jim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take the blankets off me, fahver&mdash;Jim&rsquo;s sick!&rsquo; (They&rsquo;d
    been teaching him to say father.)</p>
  <p>I was scared now. I remembered a neighbour of ours had a little girl die
    (she swallowed a pin), and when she was going she said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take the blankets off me, muvver&mdash;I&rsquo;m dying.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And I couldn&rsquo;t get that out of my head.</p>
  <p>I threw back a fold of the &rsquo;possum rug, and felt Jim&rsquo;s head&mdash; he
    seemed cool enough.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where do you feel bad, sonny?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No answer for a while; then he said suddenly, but in a voice as if he were
    talking in his sleep&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Put my boots on, please, daddy. I want to go home to muvver!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I held his hand, and comforted him for a while; then he slept&mdash; in
    a restless, feverish sort of way.</p>
  <p>I got the bucket I used for water for the horses and stood it over the fire;
    I ran to the creek with the big kerosene-tin bucket and got it full of cold
    water and stood it handy. I got the spade (we always carried one to dig wheels
    out of bogs in wet weather) and turned a corner of the tarpaulin back, dug
    a hole, and trod the tarpaulin down into the hole, to serve for a bath, in
    case of the worst. I had a tin of mustard, and meant to fight a good round
    for Jim, if death came along.</p>
  <p>I stooped in under the tail-board of the waggon and felt Jim. His head was
    burning hot, and his skin parched and dry as a bone.</p>
  <p>Then I lost nerve and started blundering backward and forward between the
    waggon and the fire, and repeating what I&rsquo;d heard Mary say the last
    time we fought for Jim: &lsquo;God! don&rsquo;t take my child! God! don&rsquo;t
    take my boy!&rsquo; I&rsquo;d never had much faith in doctors, but, my God!
    I wanted one then. The nearest was fifteen miles away.</p>
  <p>I threw back my head and stared up at the branches, in desperation; and&mdash;Well,
    I don&rsquo;t ask you to take much stock in this, though most old Bushmen
    will believe anything of the Bush by night; and&mdash;Now, it might have
    been that I was all unstrung, or it might have been a patch of sky outlined
    in the gently moving branches, or the blue smoke rising up. But I saw the
    figure of a woman, all white, come down, down, nearly to the limbs of the
    trees, point on up the main road, and then float up and up and vanish, still
    pointing. I thought Mary was dead! Then it flashed on me&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Four or five miles up the road, over the &lsquo;saddle&rsquo;, was an old
    shanty that had been a half-way inn before the Great Western Line got round
    as far as Dubbo and took the coach traffic off those old Bush roads. A man
    named Brighten lived there. He was a selector; did a little farming, and
    as much sly-grog selling as he could. He was married&mdash; but it wasn&rsquo;t
    that: I&rsquo;d thought of them, but she was a childish, worn-out, spiritless
    woman, and both were pretty &lsquo;ratty&rsquo; from hardship and loneliness&mdash; they
    weren&rsquo;t likely to be of any use to me. But it was this: I&rsquo;d heard
    talk, among some women in Gulgong, of a sister of Brighten&rsquo;s wife who&rsquo;d
    gone out to live with them lately: she&rsquo;d been a hospital matron in
    the city, they said; and there were yarns about her. Some said she got the
    sack for exposing the doctors&mdash;or carrying on with them&mdash; I didn&rsquo;t
    remember which. The fact of a city woman going out to live in such a place,
    with such people, was enough to make talk among women in a town twenty miles
    away, but then there must have been something extra about her, else Bushmen
    wouldn&rsquo;t have talked and carried her name so far; and I wanted a woman
    out of the ordinary now. I even reasoned this way, thinking like lightning,
    as I knelt over Jim between the big back wheels of the waggon.</p>
  <p>I had an old racing mare that I used as a riding hack, following the team.
    In a minute I had her saddled and bridled; I tied the end of a half-full
    chaff-bag, shook the chaff into each end and dumped it on to the pommel as
    a cushion or buffer for Jim; I wrapped him in a blanket, and scrambled into
    the saddle with him.</p>
  <p>The next minute we were stumbling down the steep bank, clattering and splashing
    over the crossing, and struggling up the opposite bank to the level. The
    mare, as I told you, was an old racer, but broken-winded&mdash;she must have
    run without wind after the first half mile. She had the old racing instinct
    in her strong, and whenever I rode in company I&rsquo;d have to pull her
    hard else she&rsquo;d race the other horse or burst. She ran low fore and
    aft, and was the easiest horse I ever rode. She ran like wheels on rails,
    with a bit of a tremble now and then &mdash;like a railway carriage&mdash;when
    she settled down to it.</p>
  <p>The chaff-bag had slipped off, in the creek I suppose, and I let the bridle-rein
    go and held Jim up to me like a baby the whole way. Let the strongest man,
    who isn&rsquo;t used to it, hold a baby in one position for five minutes&mdash;and
    Jim was fairly heavy. But I never felt the ache in my arms that night&mdash;it
    must have gone before I was in a fit state of mind to feel it. And at home
    I&rsquo;d often growled about being asked to hold the baby for a few minutes.
    I could never brood comfortably and nurse a baby at the same time. It was
    a ghostly moonlight night. There&rsquo;s no timber in the world so ghostly
    as the Australian Bush in moonlight&mdash;or just about daybreak. The all-shaped
    patches of moonlight falling between ragged, twisted boughs; the ghostly
    blue-white bark of the &lsquo;white-box&rsquo; trees; a dead naked white
    ring-barked tree, or dead white stump starting out here and there, and the
    ragged patches of shade and light on the road that made anything, from the
    shape of a spotted bullock to a naked corpse laid out stark. Roads and tracks
    through the Bush made by moonlight&mdash;  every one seeming straighter and
    clearer than the real one: you have to trust to your horse then. Sometimes
    the naked white trunk of a red stringy-bark tree, where a sheet of bark had
    been taken off, would start out like a ghost from the dark Bush. And dew
    or frost glistening on these things, according to the season. Now and again
    a great grey kangaroo, that had been feeding on a green patch down by the
    road, would start with a &lsquo;thump-thump&rsquo;, and away up the siding.</p>
  <p>The Bush seemed full of ghosts that night&mdash;all going my way&mdash; and
    being left behind by the mare. Once I stopped to look at Jim: I just sat
    back and the mare &lsquo;propped&rsquo;&mdash;she&rsquo;d been a stock-horse,
    and was used to &lsquo;cutting-out&rsquo;. I felt Jim&rsquo;s hands and forehead;
    he was in a burning fever. I bent forward, and the old mare settled down
    to it again. I kept saying out loud&mdash;and Mary and me often laughed about
    it (afterwards): &lsquo;He&rsquo;s limp yet!&mdash;Jim&rsquo;s limp yet!&rsquo; (the
    words seemed jerked out of me by sheer fright)&mdash;&lsquo;He&rsquo;s limp
    yet!&rsquo; till the mare&rsquo;s feet took it up. Then, just when I thought
    she was doing her best and racing her hardest, she suddenly started forward,
    like a cable tram gliding along on its own and the grip put on suddenly.
    It was just what she&rsquo;d do when I&rsquo;d be riding alone and a strange
    horse drew up from behind&mdash;the old racing instinct. I&nbsp;<i>felt</i>&nbsp;the
    thing too! I felt as if a strange horse&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;there! And then&mdash; the
    words just jerked out of me by sheer funk&mdash;I started saying,  &lsquo;Death
    is riding to-night! . . . Death is racing to-night! . . . Death is riding
    to-night!&rsquo; till the hoofs took that up. And I believe the old mare
    felt the black horse at her side and was going to beat him or break her heart.</p>
  <p>I was mad with anxiety and fright: I remember I kept saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be kinder to Mary after this! I&rsquo;ll take more notice of Jim!&rsquo; and
    the rest of it.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how the old mare got up the last &lsquo;pinch&rsquo;.
    She must have slackened pace, but I never noticed it: I just held Jim up
    to me and gripped the saddle with my knees&mdash; I remember the saddle jerked
    from the desperate jumps of her till I thought the girth would go. We topped
    the gap and were going down into a gully they called Dead Man&rsquo;s Hollow,
    and there, at the back of a ghostly clearing that opened from the road where
    there were some black-soil springs, was a long, low, oblong weatherboard-and-shingle
    building, with blind, broken windows in the gable-ends, and a wide steep
    verandah roof slanting down almost to the level of the window-sills&mdash;there
    was something sinister about it, I thought&mdash;like the hat of a jail-bird
    slouched over his eyes. The place looked both deserted and haunted. I saw
    no light, but that was because of the moonlight outside. The mare turned
    in at the corner of the clearing to take a short cut to the shanty, and,
    as she struggled across some marshy ground, my heart kept jerking out the
    words, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s deserted! They&rsquo;ve gone away! It&rsquo;s deserted!&rsquo; The
    mare went round to the back and pulled up between the back door and a big
    bark-and-slab kitchen. Some one shouted from inside&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s me. Joe Wilson. I want your sister-in-law&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
    got the boy&mdash;  he&rsquo;s sick and dying!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Brighten came out, pulling up his moleskins. &lsquo;What boy?&rsquo; he
    asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, take him,&rsquo; I shouted, &lsquo;and let me get down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with him?&rsquo; asked Brighten, and he seemed
    to hang back. And just as I made to get my leg over the saddle, Jim&rsquo;s
    head went back over my arm, he stiffened, and I saw his eyeballs turned up
    and glistening in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>I felt cold all over then and sick in the stomach&mdash;but&nbsp;<i>clear-headed</i>&nbsp;in
    a way: strange, wasn&rsquo;t it? I don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t get
    down and rush into the kitchen to get a bath ready. I only felt as if the
    worst had come, and I wished it were over and gone. I even thought of Mary
    and the funeral.</p>
  <p>Then a woman ran out of the house&mdash;a big, hard-looking woman. She had
    on a wrapper of some sort, and her feet were bare. She laid her hand on Jim,
    looked at his face, and then snatched him from me and ran into the kitchen&mdash;and
    me down and after her. As great good luck would have it, they had some dirty
    clothes on to boil in a kerosene tin&mdash;dish-cloths or something.</p>
  <p>Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law dragged a tub out from under the table, wrenched
    the bucket off the hook, and dumped in the water, dish-cloths and all, snatched
    a can of cold water from a corner, dashed that in, and felt the water with
    her hand&mdash;holding Jim up to her hip all the time&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t
    say how he looked. She stood him in the tub and started dashing water over
    him, tearing off his clothes between the splashes.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, that tin of mustard&mdash;there on the shelf!&rsquo; she shouted
    to me.</p>
  <p>She knocked the lid off the tin on the edge of the tub, and went on splashing
    and spanking Jim.</p>
  <p>It seemed an eternity. And I? Why, I never thought clearer in my life. I
    felt cold-blooded&mdash;I felt as if I&rsquo;d like an excuse to go outside
    till it was all over. I thought of Mary and the funeral&mdash; and wished
    that that was past. All this in a flash, as it were. I felt that it would
    be a great relief, and only wished the funeral was months past. I felt&mdash;well,
    altogether selfish. I only thought for myself.</p>
  <p>Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law splashed and spanked him hard&mdash;hard
    enough to break his back I thought, and&mdash;after about half an hour it
    seemed&mdash; the end came: Jim&rsquo;s limbs relaxed, he slipped down into
    the tub, and the pupils of his eyes came down. They seemed dull and expressionless,
    like the eyes of a new baby, but he was back for the world again.</p>
  <p>I dropped on the stool by the table.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over
    now. I wasn&rsquo;t going to let him die.&rsquo; I was only thinking, &lsquo;Well
    it&rsquo;s over now, but it will come on again. I wish it was over for good.
    I&rsquo;m tired of it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She called to her sister, Mrs Brighten, a washed-out, helpless little fool
    of a woman, who&rsquo;d been running in and out and whimpering all the time&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, Jessie! bring the new white blanket off my bed. And you, Brighten,
    take some of that wood off the fire, and stuff something in that hole there
    to stop the draught.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Brighten&mdash;he was a nuggety little hairy man with no expression to be
    seen for whiskers&mdash;had been running in with sticks and back logs from
    the wood-heap. He took the wood out, stuffed up the crack, and went inside
    and brought out a black bottle&mdash;got a cup from the shelf, and put both
    down near my elbow.</p>
  <p>Mrs Brighten started to get some supper or breakfast, or whatever it was,
    ready. She had a clean cloth, and set the table tidily. I noticed that all
    the tins were polished bright (old coffee- and mustard-tins and the like,
    that they used instead of sugar-basins and tea-caddies and salt-cellars),
    and the kitchen was kept as clean as possible. She was all right at little
    things. I knew a haggard, worked-out Bushwoman who put her whole soul&mdash;or
    all she&rsquo;d got left&mdash;into polishing old tins till they dazzled
    your eyes.</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t feel inclined for corned beef and damper, and post-and-rail
    tea. So I sat and squinted, when I thought she wasn&rsquo;t looking, at Brighten&rsquo;s
    sister-in-law. She was a big woman, her hands and feet were big, but well-shaped
    and all in proportion&mdash;they fitted her. She was a handsome woman&mdash;about
    forty I should think. She had a square chin, and a straight thin-lipped mouth&mdash; straight
    save for a hint of a turn down at the corners, which I fancied (and I have
    strange fancies) had been a sign of weakness in the days before she grew
    hard. There was no sign of weakness now. She had hard grey eyes and blue-black
    hair. She hadn&rsquo;t spoken yet. She didn&rsquo;t ask me how the boy took
    ill or I got there, or who or what I was&mdash; at least not until the next
    evening at tea-time.</p>
  <p>She sat upright with Jim wrapped in the blanket and laid across her knees,
    with one hand under his neck and the other laid lightly on him, and she just
    rocked him gently.</p>
  <p>She sat looking hard and straight before her, just as I&rsquo;ve seen a
    tired needlewoman sit with her work in her lap, and look away back into the
    past. And Jim might have been the work in her lap, for all she seemed to
    think of him. Now and then she knitted her forehead and blinked.</p>
  <p>Suddenly she glanced round and said&mdash;in a tone as if I was her husband
    and she didn&rsquo;t think much of me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you eat something?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Beg pardon?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Eat something!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I drank some tea, and sneaked another look at her. I was beginning to feel
    more natural, and wanted Jim again, now that the colour was coming back into
    his face, and he didn&rsquo;t look like an unnaturally stiff and staring
    corpse. I felt a lump rising, and wanted to thank her. I sneaked another
    look at her.</p>
  <p>She was staring straight before her,&mdash;I never saw a woman&rsquo;s face
    change so suddenly&mdash;I never saw a woman&rsquo;s eyes so haggard and
    hopeless. Then her great chest heaved twice, I heard her draw a long shuddering
    breath, like a knocked-out horse, and two great tears dropped from her wide
    open eyes down her cheeks like rain-drops on a face of stone. And in the
    firelight they seemed tinged with blood.</p>
  <p>I looked away quick, feeling full up myself. And presently (I hadn&rsquo;t
    seen her look round) she said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go to bed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Beg pardon?&rsquo; (Her face was the same as before the tears.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go to bed. There&rsquo;s a bed made for you inside on the sofa.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But&mdash;the team&mdash;I must&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The team. I left it at the camp. I must look to it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! Well, Brighten will ride down and bring it up in the morning&mdash;  or
    send the half-caste. Now you go to bed, and get a good rest. The boy will
    be all right. I&rsquo;ll see to that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I went out&mdash;it was a relief to get out&mdash;and looked to the mare.
    Brighten had got her some corn and chaff in a candle-box, but she couldn&rsquo;t
    eat yet. She just stood or hung resting one hind-leg and then the other,
    with her nose over the box&mdash;and she sobbed. I put my arms round her
    neck and my face down on her ragged mane, and cried for the second time since
    I was a boy.</p>
  <p>As I started to go in I heard Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law say, suddenly
    and sharply&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;away, Jessie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And presently I saw Mrs Brighten go into the house with the black bottle.</p>
  <p>The moon had gone behind the range. I stood for a minute between the house
    and the kitchen and peeped in through the kitchen window.</p>
  <p>She had moved away from the fire and sat near the table. She bent over Jim
    and held him up close to her and rocked herself to and fro.</p>
  <p>I went to bed and slept till the next afternoon. I woke just in time to
    hear the tail-end of a conversation between Jim and Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law.
    He was asking her out to our place and she promising to come.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And now,&rsquo; says Jim, &lsquo;I want to go home to &ldquo;muffer&rdquo; in &ldquo;The
    Same Ol&rsquo; Fling&rdquo;.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jim repeated.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh! &ldquo;The Same Old Thing&rdquo;,&mdash;the waggon.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The rest of the afternoon I poked round the gullies with old Brighten, looking
    at some &lsquo;indications&rsquo; (of the existence of gold) he had found.
    It was no use trying to &lsquo;pump&rsquo; him concerning his sister-in-law;
    Brighten was an &rsquo;old hand&rsquo;, and had learned in the old Bush-ranging
    and cattle-stealing days to know nothing about other people&rsquo;s business.
    And, by the way, I noticed then that the more you talk and listen to a bad
    character, the more you lose your dislike for him.</p>
  <p>I never saw such a change in a woman as in Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law
    that evening. She was bright and jolly, and seemed at least ten years younger.
    She bustled round and helped her sister to get tea ready. She rooted out
    some old china that Mrs Brighten had stowed away somewhere, and set the table
    as I seldom saw it set out there. She propped Jim up with pillows, and laughed
    and played with him like a great girl. She described Sydney and Sydney life
    as I&rsquo;d never heard it described before; and she knew as much about
    the Bush and old digging days as I did. She kept old Brighten and me listening
    and laughing till nearly midnight. And she seemed quick to understand everything
    when I talked. If she wanted to explain anything that we hadn&rsquo;t seen,
    she wouldn&rsquo;t say that it was &lsquo;like a&mdash;like a&rsquo;&mdash;and
    hesitate (you know what I mean); she&rsquo;d hit the right thing on the head
    at once. A squatter with a very round, flaming red face and a white cork
    hat had gone by in the afternoon: she said it was &lsquo;like a mushroom
    on the rising moon.&rsquo; She gave me a lot of good hints about children.</p>
  <p>But she was quiet again next morning. I harnessed up, and she dressed Jim
    and gave him his breakfast, and made a comfortable place for him on the load
    with the &rsquo;possum rug and a spare pillow. She got up on the wheel to
    do it herself. Then was the awkward time. I&rsquo;d half start to speak to
    her, and then turn away and go fixing up round the horses, and then make
    another false start to say good-bye. At last she took Jim up in her arms
    and kissed him, and lifted him on the wheel; but he put his arms tight round
    her neck, and kissed her&mdash;a thing Jim seldom did with anybody, except
    his mother, for he wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call an affectionate child,&mdash; he&rsquo;d
    never more than offer his cheek to me, in his old-fashioned way. I&rsquo;d
    got up the other side of the load to take him from her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here, take him,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>I saw his mouth twitching as I lifted him. Jim seldom cried nowadays&mdash; no
    matter how much he was hurt. I gained some time fixing Jim comfortable.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better make a start,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You want
    to get home early with that boy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I got down and went round to where she stood. I held out my hand and tried
    to speak, but my voice went like an ungreased waggon wheel, and I gave it
    up, and only squeezed her hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; she said; then tears came into her
    eyes, and she suddenly put her hand on my shoulder and kissed me on the cheek. &lsquo;You
    be off&mdash;you&rsquo;re only a boy yourself. Take care of that boy; be
    kind to your wife, and take care of yourself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Will you come to see us?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Some day,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>I started the horses, and looked round once more. She was looking up at
    Jim, who was waving his hand to her from the top of the load. And I saw that
    haggard, hungry, hopeless look come into her eyes in spite of the tears.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I smoothed over that story and shortened it a lot, when I told it to Mary&mdash; I
    didn&rsquo;t want to upset her. But, some time after I brought Jim home from
    Gulgong, and while I was at home with the team for a few days, nothing would
    suit Mary but she must go over to Brighten&rsquo;s shanty and see Brighten&rsquo;s
    sister-in-law. So James drove her over one morning in the spring-cart: it
    was a long way, and they stayed at Brighten&rsquo;s overnight and didn&rsquo;t
    get back till late the next afternoon. I&rsquo;d got the place in a pig-muck,
    as Mary said, &lsquo;doing for&rsquo;  myself, and I was having a snooze
    on the sofa when they got back. The first thing I remember was some one stroking
    my head and kissing me, and I heard Mary saying, &lsquo;My poor boy! My poor
    old boy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I sat up with a jerk. I thought that Jim had gone off again. But it seems
    that Mary was only referring to me. Then she started to pull grey hairs out
    of my head and put &rsquo;em in an empty match-box&mdash; to see how many
    she&rsquo;d get. She used to do this when she felt a bit soft. I don&rsquo;t
    know what she said to Brighten&rsquo;s sister-in-law or what Brighten&rsquo;s
    sister-in-law said to her, but Mary was extra gentle for the next few days.</p>

    A Lonely Track</b></h3>
  <p>The time&nbsp;Mary and I shifted out into the Bush from Gulgong to  &lsquo;settle
    on the land&rsquo; at Lahey&rsquo;s Creek.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d sold the two tip-drays that I used for tank-sinking and dam-making,
    and I took the traps out in the waggon on top of a small load of rations
    and horse-feed that I was taking to a sheep-station out that way. Mary drove
    out in the spring-cart. You remember we left little Jim with his aunt in
    Gulgong till we got settled down. I&rsquo;d sent James (Mary&rsquo;s brother)
    out the day before, on horseback, with two or three cows and some heifers
    and steers and calves we had, and I&rsquo;d told him to clean up a bit, and
    make the hut as bright and cheerful as possible before Mary came.</p>
  <p>We hadn&rsquo;t much in the way of furniture. There was the four-poster
    cedar bedstead that I bought before we were married, and Mary was rather
    proud of it: it had &lsquo;turned&rsquo; posts and joints that bolted together.
    There was a plain hardwood table, that Mary called her &lsquo;ironing-table&rsquo;,
    upside down on top of the load, with the bedding and blankets between the
    legs; there were four of those common black kitchen-chairs&mdash; with apples
    painted on the hard board backs&mdash;that we used for the parlour; there
    was a cheap batten sofa with arms at the ends and turned rails between the
    uprights of the arms (we were a little proud of the turned rails); and there
    was the camp-oven, and the three-legged pot, and pans and buckets, stuck
    about the load and hanging under the tail-board of the waggon.</p>
  <p>There was the little Wilcox &amp; Gibb&rsquo;s sewing-machine&mdash;my present
    to Mary when we were married (and what a present, looking back to it!). There
    was a cheap little rocking-chair, and a looking-glass and some pictures that
    were presents from Mary&rsquo;s friends and sister. She had her mantel-shelf
    ornaments and crockery and nick-nacks packed away, in the linen and old clothes,
    in a big tub made of half a cask, and a box that had been Jim&rsquo;s cradle.
    The live stock was a cat in one box, and in another an old rooster, and three
    hens that formed cliques, two against one, turn about, as three of the same
    sex will do all over the world. I had my old cattle-dog, and of course a
    pup on the load &mdash;I always had a pup that I gave away, or sold and didn&rsquo;t
    get paid for, or had &lsquo;touched&rsquo; (stolen) as soon as it was old
    enough. James had his three spidery, sneaking, thieving, cold-blooded kangaroo-dogs
    with him. I was taking out three months&rsquo; provisions in the way of ration-sugar,
    tea, flour, and potatoes, &amp;c.</p>
  <p>I started early, and Mary caught up to me at Ryan&rsquo;s Crossing on Sandy
    Creek, where we boiled the billy and had some dinner.</p>
  <p>Mary bustled about the camp and admired the scenery and talked too much,
    for her, and was extra cheerful, and kept her face turned from me as much
    as possible. I soon saw what was the matter. She&rsquo;d been crying to herself
    coming along the road. I thought it was all on account of leaving little
    Jim behind for the first time. She told me that she couldn&rsquo;t make up
    her mind till the last moment to leave him, and that, a mile or two along
    the road, she&rsquo;d have turned back for him, only that she knew her sister
    would laugh at her. She was always terribly anxious about the children.</p>
  <p>We cheered each other up, and Mary drove with me the rest of the way to
    the creek, along the lonely branch track, across native-apple-tree flats.
    It was a dreary, hopeless track. There was no horizon, nothing but the rough
    ashen trunks of the gnarled and stunted trees in all directions, little or
    no undergrowth, and the ground, save for the coarse, brownish tufts of dead
    grass, as bare as the road, for it was a dry season: there had been no rain
    for months, and I wondered what I should do with the cattle if there wasn&rsquo;t
    more grass on the creek.</p>
  <p>In this sort of country a stranger might travel for miles without seeming
    to have moved, for all the difference there is in the scenery. The new tracks
    were &lsquo;blazed&rsquo;&mdash;that is, slices of bark cut off from both
    sides of trees, within sight of each other, in a line, to mark the track
    until the horses and wheel-marks made it plain. A smart Bushman, with a sharp
    tomahawk, can blaze a track as he rides. But a Bushman a little used to the
    country soon picks out differences amongst the trees, half unconsciously
    as it were, and so finds his way about.</p>
  <p>Mary and I didn&rsquo;t talk much along this track&mdash;we couldn&rsquo;t
    have heard each other very well, anyway, for the &lsquo;clock-clock&rsquo; of
    the waggon and the rattle of the cart over the hard lumpy ground. And I suppose
    we both began to feel pretty dismal as the shadows lengthened. I&rsquo;d
    noticed lately that Mary and I had got out of the habit of talking to each
    other&mdash;noticed it in a vague sort of way that irritated me (as vague
    things will irritate one) when I thought of it. But then I thought, &lsquo;It
    won&rsquo;t last long&mdash;I&rsquo;ll make life brighter for her by-and-by.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>As we went along&mdash;and the track seemed endless&mdash;I got brooding,
    of course, back into the past. And I feel now, when it&rsquo;s too late,
    that Mary must have been thinking that way too. I thought of my early boyhood,
    of the hard life of &lsquo;grubbin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;milkin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;fencin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;ploughin&rsquo;&rsquo; and  &lsquo;ring-barkin&rsquo;&rsquo;, &amp;c.,
    and all for nothing. The few months at the little bark-school, with a teacher
    who couldn&rsquo;t spell. The cursed ambition or craving that tortured my
    soul as a boy&mdash; ambition or craving for&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t know what
    for! For something better and brighter, anyhow. And I made the life harder
    by reading at night.</p>
  <p>It all passed before me as I followed on in the waggon, behind Mary in the
    spring-cart. I thought of these old things more than I thought of her. She
    had tried to help me to better things. And I tried too&mdash;I had the energy
    of half-a-dozen men when I saw a road clear before me, but shied at the first
    check. Then I brooded, or dreamed of making a home&mdash;that one might call
    a home&mdash;for Mary&mdash; some day. Ah, well!&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>And what was Mary thinking about, along the lonely, changeless miles? I
    never thought of that. Of her kind, careless, gentleman father, perhaps.
    Of her girlhood. Of her homes&mdash;not the huts and camps she lived in with
    me. Of our future?&mdash;she used to plan a lot, and talk a good deal of
    our future  &mdash;but not lately. These things didn&rsquo;t strike me at
    the time&mdash;I was so deep in my own brooding. Did she think now&mdash;did
    she begin to feel now that she had made a great mistake and thrown away her
    life, but must make the best of it? This might have roused me, had I thought
    of it. But whenever I thought Mary was getting indifferent towards me, I&rsquo;d
    think, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon win her back. We&rsquo;ll be sweethearts again&mdash; when
    things brighten up a bit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s an awful thing to me, now I look back to it, to think how far
    apart we had grown, what strangers we were to each other. It seems, now,
    as though we had been sweethearts long years before, and had parted, and
    had never really met since.</p>
  <p>The sun was going down when Mary called out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s our place, Joe!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She hadn&rsquo;t seen it before, and somehow it came new and with a shock
    to me, who had been out here several times. Ahead, through the trees to the
    right, was a dark green clump of the oaks standing out of the creek, darker
    for the dead grey grass and blue-grey bush on the barren ridge in the background.
    Across the creek (it was only a deep, narrow gutter&mdash; a water-course
    with a chain of water-holes after rain), across on the other bank, stood
    the hut, on a narrow flat between the spur and the creek, and a little higher
    than this side. The land was much better than on our old selection, and there
    was good soil along the creek on both sides: I expected a rush of selectors
    out here soon. A few acres round the hut was cleared and fenced in by a light
    two-rail fence of timber split from logs and saplings. The man who took up
    this selection left it because his wife died here.</p>
  <p>It was a small oblong hut built of split slabs, and he had roofed it with
    shingles which he split in spare times. There was no verandah, but I built
    one later on. At the end of the house was a big slab-and-bark shed, bigger
    than the hut itself, with a kitchen, a skillion for tools, harness, and horse-feed,
    and a spare bedroom partitioned off with sheets of bark and old chaff-bags.
    The house itself was floored roughly, with cracks between the boards; there
    were cracks between the slabs all round&mdash;though he&rsquo;d nailed strips
    of tin, from old kerosene-tins, over some of them; the partitioned-off bedroom
    was lined with old chaff-bags with newspapers pasted over them for wall-paper.
    There was no ceiling, calico or otherwise, and we could see the round pine
    rafters and battens, and the under ends of the shingles. But ceilings make
    a hut hot and harbour insects and reptiles&mdash;snakes sometimes. There
    was one small glass window in the &lsquo;dining-room&rsquo; with three panes
    and a sheet of greased paper, and the rest were rough wooden shutters. There
    was a pretty good cow-yard and calf-pen, and&mdash;that was about all. There
    was no dam or tank (I made one later on); there was a water-cask, with the
    hoops falling off and the staves gaping, at the corner of the house, and
    spouting, made of lengths of bent tin, ran round under the eaves. Water from
    a new shingle roof is wine-red for a year or two, and water from a stringy-bark
    roof is like tan-water for years. In dry weather the selector had got his
    house water from a cask sunk in the gravel at the bottom of the deepest water-hole
    in the creek. And the longer the drought lasted, the farther he had to go
    down the creek for his water, with a cask on a cart, and take his cows to
    drink, if he had any. Four, five, six, or seven miles&mdash;even ten miles
    to water is nothing in some places.</p>
  <p>James hadn&rsquo;t found himself called upon to do more than milk old  &lsquo;Spot&rsquo; (the
    grandmother cow of our mob), pen the calf at night, make a fire in the kitchen,
    and sweep out the house with a bough. He helped me unharness and water and
    feed the horses, and then started to get the furniture off the waggon and
    into the house. James wasn&rsquo;t lazy&mdash;so long as one thing didn&rsquo;t
    last too long; but he was too uncomfortably practical and matter-of-fact
    for me. Mary and I had some tea in the kitchen. The kitchen was permanently
    furnished with a table of split slabs, adzed smooth on top, and supported
    by four stakes driven into the ground, a three-legged stool and a block of
    wood, and two long stools made of half-round slabs (sapling trunks split
    in halves) with auger-holes bored in the round side and sticks stuck into
    them for legs. The floor was of clay; the chimney of slabs and tin; the fireplace
    was about eight feet wide, lined with clay, and with a blackened pole across,
    with sooty chains and wire hooks on it for the pots.</p>
  <p>Mary didn&rsquo;t seem able to eat. She sat on the three-legged stool near
    the fire, though it was warm weather, and kept her face turned from me. Mary
    was still pretty, but not the little dumpling she had been: she was thinner
    now. She had big dark hazel eyes that shone a little too much when she was
    pleased or excited. I thought at times that there was something very German
    about her expression; also something aristocratic about the turn of her nose,
    which nipped in at the nostrils when she spoke. There was nothing aristocratic
    about me. Mary was German in figure and walk. I used sometimes to call her  &lsquo;Little
    Duchy&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pigeon Toes&rsquo;. She had a will of her own, as
    shown sometimes by the obstinate knit in her forehead between the eyes.</p>
  <p>Mary sat still by the fire, and presently I saw her chin tremble.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Mary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She turned her face farther from me. I felt tired, disappointed, and irritated&mdash;suffering
    from a reaction.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, what is it, Mary?&rsquo; I asked; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sick of this
    sort of thing. Haven&rsquo;t you got everything you wanted? You&rsquo;ve
    had your own way. What&rsquo;s the matter with you now?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know very well, Joe.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I&nbsp;<i>don&rsquo;t</i>&nbsp;know,&rsquo; I said. I knew too
    well.</p>
  <p>She said nothing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Mary,&rsquo; I said, putting my hand on her shoulder, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t
    go on like that; tell me what&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s only this,&rsquo; she said suddenly, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
    stand this life here; it will kill me!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I had a pannikin of tea in my hand, and I banged it down on the table.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;This is more than a man can stand!&rsquo; I shouted. &lsquo;You know
    very well that it was you that dragged me out here. You run me on to this!
    Why weren&rsquo;t you content to stay in Gulgong?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what sort of a place was Gulgong, Joe?&rsquo; asked Mary quietly.</p>
  <p>(I thought even then in a flash what sort of a place Gulgong was. A wretched
    remnant of a town on an abandoned goldfield. One street, each side of the
    dusty main road; three or four one-storey square brick cottages with hip
    roofs of galvanised iron that glared in the heat&mdash;four rooms and a passage&mdash;the
    police-station, bank-manager and schoolmaster&rsquo;s cottages, &amp;c. Half-a-dozen
    tumble-down weather-board shanties&mdash;the three pubs., the two stores,
    and the post-office. The town tailing off into weather-board boxes with tin
    tops, and old bark huts&mdash;relics of the digging days&mdash; propped up
    by many rotting poles. The men, when at home, mostly asleep or droning over
    their pipes or hanging about the verandah posts of the pubs., saying, &lsquo;&rsquo;Ullo,
    Bill!&rsquo; or &lsquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jim!&rsquo;&mdash; or sometimes drunk.
    The women, mostly hags, who blackened each other&rsquo;s and girls&rsquo;  characters
    with their tongues, and criticised the aristocracy&rsquo;s washing hung out
    on the line: &lsquo;And the colour of the clothes! Does that woman wash her
    clothes at all? or only soak &rsquo;em and hang &rsquo;em out?&rsquo;&mdash;that
    was Gulgong.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you come to Sydney, as I wanted you to?&rsquo; I
    asked Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know very well, Joe,&rsquo; said Mary quietly.</p>
  <p>(I knew very well, but the knowledge only maddened me. I had had an idea
    of getting a billet in one of the big wool-stores &mdash;I was a fair wool
    expert&mdash;but Mary was afraid of the drink. I could keep well away from
    it so long as I worked hard in the Bush. I had gone to Sydney twice since
    I met Mary, once before we were married, and she forgave me when I came back;
    and once afterwards. I got a billet there then, and was going to send for
    her in a month. After eight weeks she raised the money somehow and came to
    Sydney and brought me home. I got pretty low down that time.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, Mary,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;it would have been different this
    time. You would have been with me. I can take a glass now or leave it alone.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;As long as you take a glass there is danger,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what did you want to advise me to come out here for, if you
    can&rsquo;t stand it? Why didn&rsquo;t you stay where you were?&rsquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;why weren&rsquo;t you more decided?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d sat down, but I jumped to my feet then.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good God!&rsquo; I shouted, &lsquo;this is more than any man can
    stand. I&rsquo;ll chuck it all up! I&rsquo;m damned well sick and tired of
    the whole thing.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So am I, Joe,&rsquo; said Mary wearily.</p>
  <p>We quarrelled badly then&mdash;that first hour in our new home. I know now
    whose fault it was.</p>
  <p>I got my hat and went out and started to walk down the creek. I didn&rsquo;t
    feel bitter against Mary&mdash;I had spoken too cruelly to her to feel that
    way. Looking back, I could see plainly that if I had taken her advice all
    through, instead of now and again, things would have been all right with
    me. I had come away and left her crying in the hut, and James telling her,
    in a brotherly way, that it was all her fault. The trouble was that I never
    liked to  &lsquo;give in&rsquo; or go half-way to make it up&mdash;not half-way&mdash; it
    was all the way or nothing with our natures.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t make a stand now,&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    never be master. I gave up the reins when I got married, and I&rsquo;ll have
    to get them back again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>What women some men are! But the time came, and not many years after, when
    I stood by the bed where Mary lay, white and still; and, amongst other things,
    I kept saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll give in, Mary&mdash; I&rsquo;ll give in,&rsquo; and
    then I&rsquo;d laugh. They thought that I was raving mad, and took me from
    the room. But that time was to come.</p>
  <p>As I walked down the creek track in the moonlight the question rang in my
    ears again, as it had done when I first caught sight of the house that evening&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why did I bring her here?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was not fit to &lsquo;go on the land&rsquo;. The place was only fit for
    some stolid German, or Scotsman, or even Englishman and his wife, who had
    no ambition but to bullock and make a farm of the place. I had only drifted
    here through carelessness, brooding, and discontent.</p>
  <p>I walked on and on till I was more than half-way to the only neighbours&mdash; a
    wretched selector&rsquo;s family, about four miles down the creek,&mdash; and
    I thought I&rsquo;d go on to the house and see if they had any fresh meat.</p>
  <p>A mile or two farther I saw the loom of the bark hut they lived in, on a
    patchy clearing in the scrub, and heard the voice of the selector&rsquo;s
    wife&mdash;I had seen her several times: she was a gaunt, haggard Bushwoman,
    and, I supposed, the reason why she hadn&rsquo;t gone mad through hardship
    and loneliness was that she hadn&rsquo;t either the brains or the memory
    to go farther than she could see through the trunks of the &lsquo;apple-trees&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You, An-nay!&rsquo; (Annie.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ye-es&rsquo; (from somewhere in the gloom).</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell yer to water them geraniums!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, didn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell lies or I&rsquo;ll break yer young back!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I did, I tell yer&mdash;the water won&rsquo;t soak inter the ashes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Geraniums were the only flowers I saw grow in the drought out there. I remembered
    this woman had a few dirty grey-green leaves behind some sticks against the
    bark wall near the door; and in spite of the sticks the fowls used to get
    in and scratch beds under the geraniums, and scratch dust over them, and
    ashes were thrown there &mdash;with an idea of helping the flower, I suppose;
    and greasy dish-water, when fresh water was scarce&mdash;till you might as
    well try to water a dish of fat.</p>
  <p>Then the woman&rsquo;s voice again&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You, Tom-may!&rsquo; (Tommy.)</p>
  <p>Silence, save for an echo on the ridge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Y-o-u, T-o-m-<i>may</i>!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ye-e-s!&rsquo; shrill shriek from across the creek.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell you to ride up to them new people and see if
    they want any meat or any think?&rsquo; in one long screech.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I karnt find the horse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well-find-it-first-think-in-the-morning and. And-don&rsquo;t-forgit-to-tell-Mrs-Wi&rsquo;son-that-mother&rsquo;ll-be-up-as-soon-as-she-can.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t feel like going to the woman&rsquo;s house that night. I
    felt&mdash;and the thought came like a whip-stroke on my heart&mdash; that
    this was what Mary would come to if I left her here.</p>
  <p>I turned and started to walk home, fast. I&rsquo;d made up my mind. I&rsquo;d
    take Mary straight back to Gulgong in the morning&mdash; I forgot about the
    load I had to take to the sheep station. I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Look here,
    Girlie&rsquo; (that&rsquo;s what I used to call her), &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll
    leave this wretched life; we&rsquo;ll leave the Bush for ever! We&rsquo;ll
    go to Sydney, and I&rsquo;ll be a man! and work my way up.&rsquo; And I&rsquo;d
    sell waggon, horses, and all, and go.</p>
  <p>When I got to the hut it was lighted up. Mary had the only kerosene lamp,
    a slush lamp, and two tallow candles going. She had got both rooms washed
    out&mdash;to James&rsquo;s disgust, for he had to move the furniture and
    boxes about. She had a lot of things unpacked on the table; she had laid
    clean newspapers on the mantel-shelf&mdash; a slab on two pegs over the fireplace&mdash;and
    put the little wooden clock in the centre and some of the ornaments on each
    side, and was tacking a strip of vandyked American oil-cloth round the rough
    edge of the slab.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How does that look, Joe? We&rsquo;ll soon get things ship-shape.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I kissed her, but she had her mouth full of tacks. I went out in the kitchen,
    drank a pint of cold tea, and sat down.</p>
  <p>Somehow I didn&rsquo;t feel satisfied with the way things had gone.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="IIPastCarin"></a>II <br>
  &lsquo;Past Carin&rsquo;&rsquo;</b></h3>
  <p>Next&nbsp;morning things looked a lot brighter. Things always look brighter
    in the morning&mdash;more so in the Australian Bush, I should think, than
    in most other places. It is when the sun goes down on the dark bed of the
    lonely Bush, and the sunset flashes like a sea of fire and then fades, and
    then glows out again, like a bank of coals, and then burns away to ashes&mdash;it
    is then that old things come home to one. And strange, new-old things too,
    that haunt and depress you terribly, and that you can&rsquo;t understand.
    I often think how, at sunset, the past must come home to new-chum blacksheep,
    sent out to Australia and drifted into the Bush. I used to think that they
    couldn&rsquo;t have much brains, or the loneliness would drive them mad.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d decided to let James take the team for a trip or two. He could
    drive alright; he was a better business man, and no doubt would manage better
    than me&mdash;as long as the novelty lasted; and I&rsquo;d stay at home for
    a week or so, till Mary got used to the place, or I could get a girl from
    somewhere to come and stay with her. The first weeks or few months of loneliness
    are the worst, as a rule, I believe, as they say the first weeks in jail
    are&mdash;I was never there. I know it&rsquo;s so with tramping or hard graft:
    the first day or two are twice as hard as any of the rest. But, for my part,
    I could never get used to loneliness and dulness; the last days used to be
    the worst with me: then I&rsquo;d have to make a move, or drink. When you&rsquo;ve
    been too much and too long alone in a lonely place, you begin to do queer
    things and think queer thoughts&mdash;provided you have any imagination at
    all. You&rsquo;ll sometimes sit of an evening and watch the lonely track,
    by the hour, for a horseman or a cart or some one that&rsquo;s never likely
    to come that way&mdash;some one, or a stranger, that you can&rsquo;t and
    don&rsquo;t really expect to see. I think that most men who have been alone
    in the Bush for any length of time&mdash;and married couples too&mdash;are
    more or less mad. With married couples it is generally the husband who is
    painfully shy and awkward when strangers come. The woman seems to stand the
    loneliness better, and can hold her own with strangers, as a rule. It&rsquo;s
    only afterwards, and looking back, that you see how queer you got. Shepherds
    and boundary-riders, who are alone for months, <i>must</i> have their periodical
    spree, at the nearest shanty, else they&rsquo;d go raving mad. Drink is the
    only break in the awful monotony, and the yearly or half-yearly spree is
    the only thing they&rsquo;ve got to look forward to: it keeps their minds
    fixed on something definite ahead.</p>
  <p>But Mary kept her head pretty well through the first months of loneliness.&nbsp;<i>Weeks</i>,
    rather, I should say, for it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as it might have been farther
    up-country: there was generally some one came of a Sunday afternoon &mdash;a
    spring-cart with a couple of women, or maybe a family,&mdash;or a lanky shy
    Bush native or two on lanky shy horses. On a quiet Sunday, after I&rsquo;d
    brought Jim home, Mary would dress him and herself&mdash;just the same as
    if we were in town&mdash;and make me get up on one end and put on a collar
    and take her and Jim for a walk along the creek. She said she wanted to keep
    me civilised. She tried to make a gentleman of me for years, but gave it
    up gradually.</p>
  <p>Well. It was the first morning on the creek: I was greasing the waggon-wheels,
    and James out after the horse, and Mary hanging out clothes, in an old print
    dress and a big ugly white hood, when I heard her being hailed as  &lsquo;Hi,
    missus!&rsquo; from the front slip-rails.</p>
  <p>It was a boy on horseback. He was a light-haired, very much freckled boy
    of fourteen or fifteen, with a small head, but with limbs, especially his
    bare sun-blotched shanks, that might have belonged to a grown man. He had
    a good face and frank grey eyes. An old, nearly black cabbage-tree hat rested
    on the butts of his ears, turning them out at right angles from his head,
    and rather dirty sprouts they were. He wore a dirty torn Crimean shirt; and
    a pair of man&rsquo;s moleskin trousers rolled up above the knees, with the
    wide waistband gathered under a greenhide belt. I noticed, later on, that,
    even when he wore trousers short enough for him, he always rolled &rsquo;em
    up above the knees when on horseback, for some reason of his own: to suggest
    leggings, perhaps, for he had them rolled up in all weathers, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
    have bothered to save them from the sweat of the horse, even if that horse
    ever sweated.</p>
  <p>He was seated astride a three-bushel bag thrown across the ridge-pole of
    a big grey horse, with a coffin-shaped head, and built astern something after
    the style of a roughly put up hip-roofed box-bark humpy. His colour was like
    old box-bark, too, a dirty bluish-grey; and, one time, when I saw his rump
    looming out of the scrub, I really thought it was some old shepherd&rsquo;s
    hut that I hadn&rsquo;t noticed there before. When he cantered it was like
    the humpy starting off on its corner-posts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you Mrs Wilson?&rsquo; asked the boy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, mother told me to ride acrost and see if you wanted anythink.
    We killed lars&rsquo; night, and I&rsquo;ve fetched a piece er cow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Piece of&nbsp;<i>what</i>?&rsquo; asked Mary.</p>
  <p>He grinned, and handed a sugar-bag across the rail with something heavy
    in the bottom of it, that nearly jerked Mary&rsquo;s arm out when she took
    it. It was a piece of beef, that looked as if it had been cut off with a
    wood-axe, but it was fresh and clean.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rsquo; cried Mary. She was always impulsive,
    save to me sometimes. &lsquo;I was just wondering where we were going to
    get any fresh meat. How kind of your mother! Tell her I&rsquo;m very much
    obliged to her indeed.&rsquo; And she felt behind her for a poor little purse
    she had. &lsquo;And now&mdash;how much did your mother say it would be?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The boy blinked at her, and scratched his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How much will it be,&rsquo; he repeated, puzzled. &lsquo;Oh&mdash;how
    much does it weigh I-s&rsquo;pose-yer-mean. Well, it ain&rsquo;t been weighed
    at all&mdash;we ain&rsquo;t got no scales. A butcher does all that sort of
    think. We just kills it, and cooks it, and eats it&mdash;and goes by guess.
    What won&rsquo;t keep we salts down in the cask. I reckon it weighs about
    a ton by the weight of it if yer wanter know. Mother thought that if she
    sent any more it would go bad before you could scoff it. I can&rsquo;t see&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Mary, getting confused. &lsquo;But what I want
    to know is, how do you manage when you sell it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He glared at her, and scratched his head. &lsquo;Sell it? Why, we only goes
    halves in a steer with some one, or sells steers to the butcher&mdash;or
    maybe some meat to a party of fencers or surveyors, or tank-sinkers, or them
    sorter people&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, yes; but what I want to know is, how much am I to send your
    mother for this?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How much what?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Money, of course, you stupid boy,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;You seem
    a very stupid boy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then he saw what she was driving at. He began to fling his heels convulsively
    against the sides of his horse, jerking his body backward and forward at
    the same time, as if to wind up and start some clockwork machinery inside
    the horse, that made it go, and seemed to need repairing or oiling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t that sorter people, missus,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;We
    don&rsquo;t sell meat to new people that come to settle here.&rsquo; Then,
    jerking his thumb contemptuously towards the ridges, &lsquo;Go over ter Wall&rsquo;s
    if yer wanter buy meat; they sell meat ter strangers.&rsquo; (Wall was the
    big squatter over the ridges.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m&nbsp;<i>so</i>&nbsp;sorry.
    Thank your mother for me. She&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;kind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s nothink. She said to tell yer she&rsquo;ll be up
    as soon as she can. She&rsquo;d have come up yisterday evening&mdash;she
    thought yer&rsquo;d feel lonely comin&rsquo; new to a place like this&mdash;but
    she couldn&rsquo;t git up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The machinery inside the old horse showed signs of starting. You almost
    heard the wooden joints&nbsp;<i>creak</i>&nbsp;as he lurched forward, like
    an old propped-up humpy when the rotting props give way; but at the sound
    of Mary&rsquo;s voice he settled back on his foundations again. It must have
    been a very poor selection that couldn&rsquo;t afford a better spare horse
    than that.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Reach me that lump er wood, will yer, missus?&rsquo; said the boy,
    and he pointed to one of my &lsquo;spreads&rsquo; (for the team-chains) that
    lay inside the fence. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fling it back agin over the fence
    when I git this ole cow started.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But wait a minute&mdash;I&rsquo;ve forgotten your mother&rsquo;s
    name,&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>He grabbed at his thatch impatiently. &lsquo;Me mother&mdash;oh!&mdash; the
    old woman&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s Mrs Spicer. (Git up, karnt yer!)&rsquo; He
    twisted himself round, and brought the stretcher down on one of the horse&rsquo;s &lsquo;points&rsquo; (and
    he had many) with a crack that must have jarred his wrist.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you go to school?&rsquo; asked Mary. There was a three-days-a-week
    school over the ridges at Wall&rsquo;s station.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; he jerked out, keeping his legs going. &lsquo;Me&mdash;why
    I&rsquo;m going on fur fifteen. The last teacher at Wall&rsquo;s finished
    me. I&rsquo;m going to Queensland next month drovin&rsquo;.&rsquo; (Queensland
    border was over three hundred miles away.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Finished you? How?&rsquo; asked Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Me edgercation, of course! How do yer expect me to start this horse
    when yer keep talkin&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He split the &lsquo;spread&rsquo; over the horse&rsquo;s point, threw the
    pieces over the fence, and was off, his elbows and legs flinging wildly,
    and the old saw-stool lumbering along the road like an old working bullock
    trying a canter. That horse wasn&rsquo;t a trotter.</p>
  <p>And next month he&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;start for Queensland. He was a younger
    son and a surplus boy on a wretched, poverty-stricken selection; and as there
    was &lsquo;northin&rsquo; doin&rsquo;&rsquo; in the district, his father
    (in a burst of fatherly kindness, I suppose) made him a present of the old
    horse and a new pair of Blucher boots, and I gave him an old saddle and a
    coat, and he started for the Never-Never Country.</p>
  <p>And I&rsquo;ll bet he got there. But I&rsquo;m doubtful if the old horse
    did.</p>
  <p>Mary gave the boy five shillings, and I don&rsquo;t think he had anything
    more except a clean shirt and an extra pair of white cotton socks.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Spicer&rsquo;s farm&rsquo; was a big bark humpy on a patchy clearing
    in the native apple-tree scrub. The clearing was fenced in by a light &lsquo;dog-legged&rsquo;  fence
    (a fence of sapling poles resting on forks and X-shaped uprights), and the
    dusty ground round the house was almost entirely covered with cattle-dung.
    There was no attempt at cultivation when I came to live on the creek; but
    there were old furrow-marks amongst the stumps of another shapeless patch
    in the scrub near the hut. There was a wretched sapling cow-yard and calf-pen,
    and a cow-bail with one sheet of bark over it for shelter. There was no dairy
    to be seen, and I suppose the milk was set in one of the two skillion rooms,
    or lean-to&rsquo;s behind the hut,&mdash;the other was &lsquo;the boys&rsquo; bedroom&rsquo;.
    The Spicers kept a few cows and steers, and had thirty or forty sheep. Mrs
    Spicer used to drive down the creek once a-week, in her rickety old spring-cart,
    to Cobborah, with butter and eggs. The hut was nearly as bare inside as it
    was out&mdash;just a frame of &lsquo;round-timber&rsquo; (sapling poles)
    covered with bark. The furniture was permanent (unless you rooted it up),
    like in our kitchen: a rough slab table on stakes driven into the ground,
    and seats made the same way. Mary told me afterwards that the beds in the
    bag-and-bark partitioned-off room (&lsquo;mother&rsquo;s bedroom&rsquo;)
    were simply poles laid side by side on cross-pieces supported by stakes driven
    into the ground, with straw mattresses and some worn-out bed-clothes. Mrs
    Spicer had an old patchwork quilt, in rags, and the remains of a white one,
    and Mary said it was pitiful to see how these things would be spread over
    the beds&mdash; to hide them as much as possible&mdash;when she went down
    there. A packing-case, with something like an old print skirt draped round
    it, and a cracked looking-glass (without a frame) on top, was the dressing-table.
    There were a couple of gin-cases for a wardrobe. The boys&rsquo; beds were
    three-bushel bags stretched between poles fastened to uprights. The floor
    was the original surface, tramped hard, worn uneven with much sweeping, and
    with puddles in rainy weather where the roof leaked. Mrs Spicer used to stand
    old tins, dishes, and buckets under as many of the leaks as she could. The
    saucepans, kettles, and boilers were old kerosene-tins and billies. They
    used kerosene-tins, too, cut longways in halves, for setting the milk in.
    The plates and cups were of tin; there were two or three cups without saucers,
    and a crockery plate or two&mdash;also two mugs, cracked and without handles,
    one with &lsquo;For a Good Boy&rsquo; and the other with &lsquo;For a Good
    Girl&rsquo; on it; but all these were kept on the mantel-shelf for ornament
    and for company. They were the only ornaments in the house, save a little
    wooden clock that hadn&rsquo;t gone for years. Mrs Spicer had a superstition
    that she had &lsquo;some things packed away from the children.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The pictures were cut from old copies of the&nbsp;<i>Illustrated Sydney
      News</i>&nbsp;and pasted on to the bark. I remember this, because I remembered,
      long ago, the Spencers, who were our neighbours when I was a boy, had the
      walls of their bedroom covered with illustrations of the American Civil
      War, cut from illustrated London papers, and I used to &lsquo;sneak&rsquo; into &lsquo;mother&rsquo;s
      bedroom&rsquo; with Fred Spencer whenever we got the chance, and gloat
      over the prints. I gave him a blade of a pocket-knife once, for taking
      me in there.</p>
  <p>I saw very little of Spicer. He was a big, dark, dark-haired and whiskered
    man. I had an idea that he wasn&rsquo;t a selector at all, only a &lsquo;dummy&rsquo;  for
    the squatter of the Cobborah run. You see, selectors were allowed to take
    up land on runs, or pastoral leases. The squatters kept them off as much
    as possible, by all manner of dodges and paltry persecution. The squatter
    would get as much freehold as he could afford, &lsquo;select&rsquo; as much
    land as the law allowed one man to take up, and then employ dummies (dummy
    selectors) to take up bits of land that he fancied about his run, and hold
    them for him.</p>
  <p>Spicer seemed gloomy and unsociable. He was seldom at home. He was generally
    supposed to be away shearin&rsquo;, or fencin&rsquo;, or workin&rsquo; on
    somebody&rsquo;s station. It turned out that the last six months he was away
    it was on the evidence of a cask of beef and a hide with the brand cut out,
    found in his camp on a fencing contract up-country, and which he and his
    mates couldn&rsquo;t account for satisfactorily, while the squatter could.
    Then the family lived mostly on bread and honey, or bread and treacle, or
    bread and dripping, and tea. Every ounce of butter and every egg was needed
    for the market, to keep them in flour, tea, and sugar. Mary found that out,
    but couldn&rsquo;t help them much&mdash;except by  &lsquo;stuffing&rsquo; the
    children with bread and meat or bread and jam whenever they came up to our
    place&mdash;for Mrs Spicer was proud with the pride that lies down in the
    end and turns its face to the wall and dies.</p>
  <p>Once, when Mary asked Annie, the eldest girl at home, if she was hungry,
    she denied it&mdash;but she looked it. A ragged mite she had with her explained
    things. The little fellow said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mother told Annie not to say we was hungry if yer asked; but if yer
    give us anythink to eat, we was to take it an&rsquo; say thenk yer, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; told yer a lie; but I thought Jimmy
    would split on me, Mrs Wilson,&rsquo; said Annie. &lsquo;Thenk yer, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was not a big woman. She was gaunt and flat-chested, and her face was &lsquo;burnt
    to a brick&rsquo;, as they say out there. She had brown eyes, nearly red,
    and a little wild-looking at times, and a sharp face&mdash;ground sharp by
    hardship&mdash;the cheeks drawn in. She had an expression like&mdash;well,
    like a woman who had been very curious and suspicious at one time, and wanted
    to know everybody&rsquo;s business and hear everything, and had lost all
    her curiosity, without losing the expression or the quick suspicious movements
    of the head. I don&rsquo;t suppose you understand. I can&rsquo;t explain
    it any other way. She was not more than forty.</p>
  <p>I remember the first morning I saw her. I was going up the creek to look
    at the selection for the first time, and called at the hut to see if she
    had a bit of fresh mutton, as I had none and was sick of &lsquo;corned beef&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes&mdash;of&mdash;course,&rsquo; she said, in a sharp nasty tone,
    as if to say,  &lsquo;Is there anything more you want while the shop&rsquo;s
    open?&rsquo; I&rsquo;d met just the same sort of woman years before while
    I was carrying swag between the shearing-sheds in the awful scrubs out west
    of the Darling river, so I didn&rsquo;t turn on my heels and walk away. I
    waited for her to speak again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come&mdash;inside,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and sit down. I see you&rsquo;ve
    got the waggon outside. I s&rsquo;pose your name&rsquo;s Wilson, ain&rsquo;t
    it? You&rsquo;re thinkin&rsquo; about takin&rsquo; on Harry Marshfield&rsquo;s
    selection up the creek, so I heard. Wait till I fry you a chop and boil the
    billy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Her voice sounded, more than anything else, like a voice coming out of a
    phonograph&mdash;I heard one in Sydney the other day&mdash; and not like
    a voice coming out of her. But sometimes when she got outside her everyday
    life on this selection she spoke in a sort of&mdash; in a sort of lost groping-in-the-dark
    kind of voice.</p>
  <p>She didn&rsquo;t talk much this time&mdash;just spoke in a mechanical way
    of the drought, and the hard times, &lsquo;an&rsquo; butter &lsquo;n&rsquo; eggs
    bein&rsquo; down, an&rsquo; her husban&rsquo; an&rsquo; eldest son bein&rsquo; away,
    an&rsquo; that makin&rsquo; it so hard for her.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t know how many children she had. I never got a chance to count
    them, for they were nearly all small, and shy as piccaninnies, and used to
    run and hide when anybody came. They were mostly nearly as black as piccaninnies
    too. She must have averaged a baby a-year for years&mdash; and God only knows
    how she got over her confinements! Once, they said, she only had a black
    gin with her. She had an elder boy and girl, but she seldom spoke of them.
    The girl, &lsquo;Liza&rsquo;, was &lsquo;in service in Sydney.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m
    afraid I knew what that meant. The elder son was &lsquo;away&rsquo;. He had
    been a bit of a favourite round there, it seemed.</p>
  <p>Some one might ask her, &lsquo;How&rsquo;s your son Jack, Mrs Spicer?&rsquo; or,  &lsquo;Heard
    of Jack lately? and where is he now?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s somewheres up country,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d say in the &lsquo;groping&rsquo;  voice,
    or &lsquo;He&rsquo;s drovin&rsquo; in Queenslan&rsquo;,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Shearin&rsquo; on
    the Darlin&rsquo; the last time I heerd from him.&rsquo; &lsquo;We ain&rsquo;t
    had a line from him since&mdash;les&rsquo; see&mdash; since Chris&rsquo;mas &lsquo;fore
    last.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And she&rsquo;d turn her haggard eyes in a helpless, hopeless sort of way
    towards the west&mdash;towards &rsquo;up-country&rsquo; and &lsquo;Outback&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>The eldest girl at home was nine or ten, with a little old face and lines
    across her forehead: she had an older expression than her mother. Tommy went
    to Queensland, as I told you. The eldest son at home, Bill (older than Tommy),
    was &lsquo;a bit wild.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve passed the place in smothering hot mornings in December, when
    the droppings about the cow-yard had crumpled to dust that rose in the warm,
    sickly, sunrise wind, and seen that woman at work in the cow-yard, &lsquo;bailing
    up&rsquo;  and leg-roping cows, milking, or hauling at a rope round the neck
    of a half-grown calf that was too strong for her (and she was tough as fencing-wire),
    or humping great buckets of sour milk to the pigs or the  &lsquo;poddies&rsquo; (hand-fed
    calves) in the pen. I&rsquo;d get off the horse and give her a hand sometimes
    with a young steer, or a cranky old cow that wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;bail-up&rsquo;  and
    threatened her with her horns. She&rsquo;d say&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thenk yer, Mr Wilson. Do yer think we&rsquo;re ever goin&rsquo; to
    have any rain?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve ridden past the place on bitter black rainy mornings in June
    or July, and seen her trudging about the yard&mdash;that was ankle-deep in
    black liquid filth&mdash;with an old pair of Blucher boots on, and an old
    coat of her husband&rsquo;s, or maybe a three-bushel bag over her shoulders.
    I&rsquo;ve seen her climbing on the roof by means of the water-cask at the
    corner, and trying to stop a leak by shoving a piece of tin in under the
    bark. And when I&rsquo;d fixed the leak&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thenk yer, Mr Wilson. This drop of rain&rsquo;s a blessin&rsquo;!
    Come in and have a dry at the fire and I&rsquo;ll make yer a cup of tea.&rsquo; And,
    if I was in a hurry, &lsquo;Come in, man alive! Come in! and dry yerself
    a bit till the rain holds up. Yer can&rsquo;t go home like this! Yer&rsquo;ll
    git yer death o&rsquo; cold.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve even seen her, in the terrible drought, climbing she-oaks and
    apple-trees by a makeshift ladder, and awkwardly lopping off boughs to feed
    the starving cattle.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jist tryin&rsquo; ter keep the milkers alive till the rain comes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They said that when the pleuro-pneumonia was in the district and amongst
    her cattle she bled and physicked them herself, and fed those that were down
    with slices of half-ripe pumpkins (from a crop that had failed).</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An&rsquo;, one day,&rsquo; she told Mary, &lsquo;there was a big
    barren heifer (that we called Queen Elizabeth) that was down with the ploorer.
    She&rsquo;d been down for four days and hadn&rsquo;t moved, when one mornin&rsquo; I
    dumped some wheaten chaff&mdash;we had a few bags that Spicer brought home&mdash; I
    dumped it in front of her nose, an&rsquo;&mdash;would yer b&rsquo;lieve me,
    Mrs Wilson?&mdash; she stumbled onter her feet an&rsquo;  chased me all the
    way to the house! I had to pick up me skirts an&rsquo; run! Wasn&rsquo;t
    it redic&rsquo;lus?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They had a sense of the ridiculous, most of those poor sun-dried Bushwomen.
    I fancy that that helped save them from madness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We lost nearly all our milkers,&rsquo; she told Mary. &lsquo;I remember
    one day Tommy came running to the house and screamed: &lsquo;Marther! [mother]
    there&rsquo;s another milker down with the ploorer!&rsquo; Jist as if it
    was great news. Well, Mrs Wilson, I was dead-beat, an&rsquo; I giv&rsquo; in.
    I jist sat down to have a good cry, and felt for my han&rsquo;kerchief&mdash;it&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;a
    rag of a han&rsquo;kerchief, full of holes (all me others was in the wash).
    Without seein&rsquo; what I was doin&rsquo; I put me finger through one hole
    in the han&rsquo;kerchief an&rsquo; me thumb through the other, and poked
    me fingers into me eyes, instead of wipin&rsquo; them. Then I had to laugh.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a story that once, when the Bush, or rather grass, fires were
    out all along the creek on Spicer&rsquo;s side, Wall&rsquo;s station hands
    were up above our place, trying to keep the fire back from the boundary,
    and towards evening one of the men happened to think of the Spicers: they
    saw smoke down that way. Spicer was away from home, and they had a small
    crop of wheat, nearly ripe, on the selection.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God! that poor devil of a woman will be burnt out, if she ain&rsquo;t
    already!&rsquo; shouted young Billy Wall. &lsquo;Come along, three or four
    of you chaps&rsquo;&mdash; (it was shearing-time, and there were plenty of
    men on the station).</p>
  <p>They raced down the creek to Spicer&rsquo;s, and were just in time to save
    the wheat. She had her sleeves tucked up, and was beating out the burning
    grass with a bough. She&rsquo;d been at it for an hour, and was as black
    as a gin, they said. She only said when they&rsquo;d turned the fire: &lsquo;Thenk
    yer! Wait an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll make some tea.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>After tea the first Sunday she came to see us, Mary asked:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel lonely, Mrs Spicer, when your husband goes away?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;no, Mrs Wilson,&rsquo; she said in the groping sort of
    voice. &lsquo;I uster, once. I remember, when we lived on the Cudgeegong
    river&mdash; we lived in a brick house then&mdash;the first time Spicer had
    to go away from home I nearly fretted my eyes out. And he was only goin&rsquo; shearin&rsquo; for
    a month. I muster bin a fool; but then we were only jist married a little
    while. He&rsquo;s been away drovin&rsquo; in Queenslan&rsquo; as long as
    eighteen months at a time since then. But&rsquo; (her voice seemed to grope
    in the dark more than ever) &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind,&mdash; I somehow seem
    to have got past carin&rsquo;. Besides&mdash;besides, Spicer was a very different
    man then to what he is now. He&rsquo;s got so moody and gloomy at home, he
    hardly ever speaks.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mary sat silent for a minute thinking. Then Mrs Spicer roused herself&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about! You mustn&rsquo;t
    take any notice of me, Mrs Wilson,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t often go on like this.
    I do believe I&rsquo;m gittin&rsquo; a bit ratty at times. It must be the
    heat and the dulness.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But once or twice afterwards she referred to a time &lsquo;when Spicer was
    a different man to what he was now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I walked home with her a piece along the creek. She said nothing for a long
    time, and seemed to be thinking in a puzzled way. Then she said suddenly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What-did-you-bring-her-here-for? She&rsquo;s only a girl.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I beg pardon, Mrs Spicer.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talkin&rsquo; about! I b&rsquo;lieve
    I&rsquo;m gittin&rsquo;  ratty. You mustn&rsquo;t take any notice of me,
    Mr Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She wasn&rsquo;t much company for Mary; and often, when she had a child
    with her, she&rsquo;d start taking notice of the baby while Mary was talking,
    which used to exasperate Mary. But poor Mrs Spicer couldn&rsquo;t help it,
    and she seemed to hear all the same.</p>
  <p>Her great trouble was that she &lsquo;couldn&rsquo;t git no reg&rsquo;lar
    schoolin&rsquo;  for the children.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I learns &rsquo;em at home as much as I can. But I don&rsquo;t git
    a minute to call me own; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m ginerally that dead-beat at
    night that I&rsquo;m fit for nothink.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mary had some of the children up now and then later on, and taught them
    a little. When she first offered to do so, Mrs Spicer laid hold of the handiest
    youngster and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&mdash;do you hear that? Mrs Wilson is goin&rsquo; to teach
    yer, an&rsquo;  it&rsquo;s more than yer deserve!&rsquo; (the youngster had
    been &lsquo;cryin&rsquo;&rsquo; over something).  &lsquo;Now, go up an&rsquo; say &ldquo;Thenk
    yer, Mrs Wilson.&rdquo; And if yer ain&rsquo;t good, and don&rsquo;t do as
    she tells yer, I&rsquo;ll break every bone in yer young body!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The poor little devil stammered something, and escaped.</p>
  <p>The children were sent by turns over to Wall&rsquo;s to Sunday-school. When
    Tommy was at home he had a new pair of elastic-side boots, and there was
    no end of rows about them in the family&mdash; for the mother made him lend
    them to his sister Annie, to go to Sunday-school in, in her turn. There were
    only about three pairs of anyway decent boots in the family, and these were
    saved for great occasions. The children were always as clean and tidy as
    possible when they came to our place.</p>
  <p>And I think the saddest and most pathetic sight on the face of God&rsquo;s
    earth is the children of very poor people made to appear well: the broken
    worn-out boots polished or greased, the blackened (inked) pieces of string
    for laces; the clean patched pinafores over the wretched threadbare frocks.
    Behind the little row of children hand-in-hand&mdash;and no matter where
    they are&mdash;I always see the worn face of the mother.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the first year on the selection our little girl came.
    I&rsquo;d sent Mary to Gulgong for four months that time, and when she came
    back with the baby Mrs Spicer used to come up pretty often. She came up several
    times when Mary was ill, to lend a hand. She wouldn&rsquo;t sit down and
    condole with Mary, or waste her time asking questions, or talking about the
    time when she was ill herself. She&rsquo;d take off her hat&mdash;a shapeless
    little lump of black straw she wore for visiting&mdash;give her hair a quick
    brush back with the palms of her hands, roll up her sleeves, and set to work
    to &lsquo;tidy up&rsquo;. She seemed to take most pleasure in sorting out
    our children&rsquo;s clothes, and dressing them. Perhaps she used to dress
    her own like that in the days when Spicer was a different man from what he
    was now. She seemed interested in the fashion-plates of some women&rsquo;s
    journals we had, and used to study them with an interest that puzzled me,
    for she was not likely to go in for fashion. She never talked of her early
    girlhood; but Mary, from some things she noticed, was inclined to think that
    Mrs Spicer had been fairly well brought up. For instance, Dr Balanfantie,
    from Cudgeegong, came out to see Wall&rsquo;s wife, and drove up the creek
    to our place on his way back to see how Mary and the baby were getting on.
    Mary got out some crockery and some table-napkins that she had packed away
    for occasions like this; and she said that the way Mrs Spicer handled the
    things, and helped set the table (though she did it in a mechanical sort
    of way), convinced her that she had been used to table-napkins at one time
    in her life.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, after a long pause in the conversation, Mrs Spicer would say
    suddenly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll come up next week, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Mrs Spicer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because the visits doesn&rsquo;t do me any good. I git the dismals
    afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Mrs Spicer? What on earth do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,-I-don&rsquo;t-know-what-I&rsquo;m-talkin&rsquo;-about. You mustn&rsquo;t
    take any notice of me.&rsquo; And she&rsquo;d put on her hat, kiss the children&mdash;and
    Mary too, sometimes, as if she mistook her for a child&mdash;and go.</p>
  <p>Mary thought her a little mad at times. But I seemed to understand.</p>
  <p>Once, when Mrs Spicer was sick, Mary went down to her, and down again next
    day. As she was coming away the second time, Mrs Spicer said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t come down any more till I&rsquo;m on me
    feet, Mrs Wilson. The children can do for me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, Mrs Spicer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, the place is in such a muck, and it hurts me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We were the aristocrats of Lahey&rsquo;s Creek. Whenever we drove down on
    Sunday afternoon to see Mrs Spicer, and as soon as we got near enough for
    them to hear the rattle of the cart, we&rsquo;d see the children running
    to the house as fast as they could split, and hear them screaming&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, marther! Here comes Mr and Mrs Wilson in their spring-cart.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And we&rsquo;d see her bustle round, and two or three fowls fly out the
    front door, and she&rsquo;d lay hold of a broom (made of a bound bunch of  &lsquo;broom-stuff&rsquo; &mdash;coarse
    reedy grass or bush from the ridges&mdash;with a stick stuck in it) and flick
    out the floor, with a flick or two round in front of the door perhaps. The
    floor nearly always needed at least one flick of the broom on account of
    the fowls. Or she&rsquo;d catch a youngster and scrub his face with a wet
    end of a cloudy towel, or twist the towel round her finger and dig out his
    ears&mdash;as if she was anxious to have him hear every word that was going
    to be said.</p>
  <p>No matter what state the house would be in she&rsquo;d always say, &lsquo;I
    was jist expectin&rsquo; yer, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo; And she was original in
    that, anyway.</p>
  <p>She had an old patched and darned white table-cloth that she used to spread
    on the table when we were there, as a matter of course (&lsquo;The others
    is in the wash, so you must excuse this, Mrs Wilson&rsquo;), but I saw by
    the eyes of the children that the cloth was rather a wonderful thing to them. &lsquo;I
    must really git some more knives an&rsquo; forks next time I&rsquo;m in Cobborah,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
    say.  &lsquo;The children break an&rsquo; lose &rsquo;em till I&rsquo;m ashamed
    to ask Christians ter sit down ter the table.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She had many Bush yarns, some of them very funny, some of them rather ghastly,
    but all interesting, and with a grim sort of humour about them. But the effect
    was often spoilt by her screaming at the children to &lsquo;Drive out them
    fowls, karnt yer,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Take yer maulies [hands] outer the sugar,&rsquo; or  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    touch Mrs Wilson&rsquo;s baby with them dirty maulies,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    stand starin&rsquo; at Mrs Wilson with yer mouth an&rsquo; ears in that vulgar
    way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Poor woman! she seemed everlastingly nagging at the children. It was a habit,
    but they didn&rsquo;t seem to mind. Most Bushwomen get the nagging habit.
    I remember one, who had the prettiest, dearest, sweetest, most willing, and
    affectionate little girl I think I ever saw, and she nagged that child from
    daylight till dark&mdash;and after it. Taking it all round, I think that
    the nagging habit in a mother is often worse on ordinary children, and more
    deadly on sensitive youngsters, than the drinking habit in a father.</p>
  <p>One of the yarns Mrs Spicer told us was about a squatter she knew who used
    to go wrong in his head every now and again, and try to commit suicide. Once,
    when the station-hand, who was watching him, had his eye off him for a minute,
    he hanged himself to a beam in the stable. The men ran in and found him hanging
    and kicking. &lsquo;They let him hang for a while,&rsquo; said Mrs Spicer, &lsquo;till
    he went black in the face and stopped kicking. Then they cut him down and
    threw a bucket of water over him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why! what on earth did they let the man hang for?&rsquo; asked Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To give him a good bellyful of it: they thought it would cure him
    of tryin&rsquo; to hang himself again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the coolest thing I ever heard of,&rsquo; said
    Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s jist what the magistrate said, Mrs Wilson,&rsquo; said
    Mrs Spicer.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One morning,&rsquo; said Mrs Spicer, &lsquo;Spicer had gone off on
    his horse somewhere, and I was alone with the children, when a man came to
    the door and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, woman, give me a drink!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lord only knows where he came from! He was dressed like a new chum&mdash; his
    clothes was good, but he looked as if he&rsquo;d been sleepin&rsquo; in them
    in the Bush for a month. He was very shaky. I had some coffee that mornin&rsquo;,
    so I gave him some in a pint pot; he drank it, and then he stood on his head
    till he tumbled over, and then he stood up on his feet and said, &ldquo;Thenk
    yer, mum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was so surprised that I didn&rsquo;t know what to say, so I jist
    said, &ldquo;Would you like some more coffee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes, thenk yer,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;about two quarts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I nearly filled the pint pot, and he drank it and stood on his head
    as long as he could, and when he got right end up he said, &ldquo;Thenk yer,
    mum&mdash;it&rsquo;s a fine day,&rdquo; and then he walked off. He had two
    saddle-straps in his hands.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why, what did he stand on his head for?&rsquo; asked Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To wash it up and down, I suppose, to get twice as much taste of
    the coffee. He had no hat. I sent Tommy across to Wall&rsquo;s to tell them
    that there was a man wanderin&rsquo; about the Bush in the horrors of drink,
    and to get some one to ride for the police. But they was too late, for he
    hanged himself that night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;O Lord!&rsquo; cried Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, right close to here, jist down the creek where the track to
    Wall&rsquo;s branches off. Tommy found him while he was out after the cows.
    Hangin&rsquo;  to the branch of a tree with the two saddle-straps.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mary stared at her, speechless.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tommy came home yellin&rsquo; with fright. I sent him over to Wall&rsquo;s
    at once. After breakfast, the minute my eyes was off them, the children slipped
    away and went down there. They came back screamin&rsquo; at the tops of their
    voices. I did give it to them. I reckon they won&rsquo;t want ter see a dead
    body again in a hurry. Every time I&rsquo;d mention it they&rsquo;d huddle
    together, or ketch hold of me skirts and howl.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yer&rsquo;ll go agen when I tell yer not to,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d
    say.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh no, mother,&rdquo; they&rsquo;d howl.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yer wanted ter see a man hangin&rsquo;,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, mother! Don&rsquo;t talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yer wouldn&rsquo;t be satisfied till yer see it,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d
    say; &ldquo;yer had to see it or burst. Yer satisfied now, ain&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, mother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yer run all the way there, I s&rsquo;pose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, mother!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But yer run faster back, didn&rsquo;t yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; said Mrs Spicer, in conclusion, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d been
    down to see it myself before they was up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And ain&rsquo;t you afraid to live alone here, after all these horrible
    things?&rsquo; asked Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, no; I don&rsquo;t mind. I seem to have got past carin&rsquo; for
    anythink now. I felt it a little when Tommy went away&mdash;the first time
    I felt anythink for years. But I&rsquo;m over that now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you got any friends in the district, Mrs Spicer?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh yes. There&rsquo;s me married sister near Cobborah, and a married
    brother near Dubbo; he&rsquo;s got a station. They wanted to take me an&rsquo; the
    children between them, or take some of the younger children. But I couldn&rsquo;t
    bring my mind to break up the home. I want to keep the children together
    as much as possible. There&rsquo;s enough of them gone, God knows. But it&rsquo;s
    a comfort to know that there&rsquo;s some one to see to them if anythink
    happens to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One day&mdash;I was on my way home with the team that day&mdash; Annie Spicer
    came running up the creek in terrible trouble.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Mrs Wilson! something terribl&rsquo;s happened at home! A trooper&rsquo;  (mounted
    policeman&mdash;they called them &lsquo;mounted troopers&rsquo; out there), &lsquo;a
    trooper&rsquo;s come and took Billy!&rsquo; Billy was the eldest son at home.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s true, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What for? What did the policeman say?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&mdash;he&mdash;he said, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m very sorry, Mrs
    Spicer; but&mdash;I&mdash;I want William.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>It turned out that William was wanted on account of a horse missed from
    Wall&rsquo;s station and sold down-country.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;An&rsquo; mother took on awful,&rsquo; sobbed Annie; &lsquo;an&rsquo; now
    she&rsquo;ll only sit stock-still an&rsquo; stare in front of her, and won&rsquo;t
    take no notice of any of us. Oh! it&rsquo;s awful, Mrs Wilson. The policeman
    said he&rsquo;d tell Aunt Emma&rsquo; (Mrs Spicer&rsquo;s sister at Cobborah), &lsquo;and
    send her out. But I had to come to you, an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ve run all the
    way.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>James put the horse to the cart and drove Mary down.</p>
  <p>Mary told me all about it when I came home.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I found her just as Annie said; but she broke down and cried in my
    arms. Oh, Joe! it was awful! She didn&rsquo;t cry like a woman. I heard a
    man at Haviland cry at his brother&rsquo;s funeral, and it was just like
    that. She came round a bit after a while. Her sister&rsquo;s with her now.
    . . . Oh, Joe! you must take me away from the Bush.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Later on Mary said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How the oaks are sighing to-night, Joe!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Next morning I rode across to Wall&rsquo;s station and tackled the old man;
    but he was a hard man, and wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me&mdash;in fact, he
    ordered me off the station. I was a selector, and that was enough for him.
    But young Billy Wall rode after me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a blanky shame.
    All for the sake of a horse! And as if that poor devil of a woman hasn&rsquo;t
    got enough to put up with already! I wouldn&rsquo;t do it for twenty horses.&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;tackle
    the boss, and if he won&rsquo;t listen to me, I&rsquo;ll walk off the run
    for the last time, if I have to carry my swag.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Billy Wall managed it. The charge was withdrawn, and we got young Billy
    Spicer off up-country.</p>
  <p>But poor Mrs Spicer was never the same after that. She seldom came up to
    our place unless Mary dragged her, so to speak; and then she would talk of
    nothing but her last trouble, till her visits were painful to look forward
    to.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If it only could have been kep&rsquo; quiet&mdash;for the sake of
    the other children; they are all I think of now. I tried to bring &rsquo;em
    all up decent, but I s&rsquo;pose it was my fault, somehow. It&rsquo;s the
    disgrace that&rsquo;s killin&rsquo; me&mdash; I can&rsquo;t bear it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I was at home one Sunday with Mary and a jolly Bush-girl named Maggie Charlsworth,
    who rode over sometimes from Wall&rsquo;s station (I must tell you about
    her some other time; James was &lsquo;shook after her&rsquo;), and we got
    talkin&rsquo;  about Mrs Spicer. Maggie was very warm about old Wall.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I expected Mrs Spicer up to-day,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;She seems
    better lately.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why!&rsquo; cried Maggie Charlsworth, &lsquo;if that ain&rsquo;t
    Annie coming running up along the creek. Something&rsquo;s the matter!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We all jumped up and ran out.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Annie?&rsquo; cried Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Mrs Wilson! Mother&rsquo;s asleep, and we can&rsquo;t wake her!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s the truth, Mrs Wilson.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How long has she been asleep?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Since lars&rsquo; night.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God!&rsquo; cried Mary, &lsquo;<i>since last night</i>?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Mrs Wilson, not all the time; she woke wonst, about daylight
    this mornin&rsquo;. She called me and said she didn&rsquo;t feel well, and
    I&rsquo;d have to manage the milkin&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Was that all she said?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. She said not to go for you; and she said to feed the pigs and
    calves; and she said to be sure and water them geraniums.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mary wanted to go, but I wouldn&rsquo;t let her. James and I saddled our
    horses and rode down the creek.</p>

    Spuds, and a Woman&rsquo;s Obstinacy</b></h3>
  <p>Ever&nbsp;since we were married it had been Mary&rsquo;s great ambition
    to have a buggy. The house or furniture didn&rsquo;t matter so much&mdash;out
    there in the Bush where we were&mdash;but, where there were no railways or
    coaches, and the roads were long, and mostly hot and dusty, a buggy was the
    great thing. I had a few pounds when we were married, and was going to get
    one then; but new buggies went high, and another party got hold of a second-hand
    one that I&rsquo;d had my eye on, so Mary thought it over and at last she
    said, &lsquo;Never mind the buggy, Joe; get a sewing-machine and I&rsquo;ll
    be satisfied. I&rsquo;ll want the machine more than the buggy, for a while.
    Wait till we&rsquo;re better off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After that, whenever I took a contract&mdash;to put up a fence or wool-shed,
    or sink a dam or something&mdash;Mary would say, &lsquo;You ought to knock
    a buggy out of this job, Joe;&rsquo; but something always turned up&mdash; bad
    weather or sickness. Once I cut my foot with the adze and was laid up; and,
    another time, a dam I was making was washed away by a flood before I finished
    it. Then Mary would say, &lsquo;Ah, well&mdash;never mind, Joe. Wait till
    we are better off.&rsquo; But she felt it hard the time I built a wool-shed
    and didn&rsquo;t get paid for it, for we&rsquo;d as good as settled about
    another second-hand buggy then.</p>
  <p>I always had a fancy for carpentering, and was handy with tools. I made
    a spring-cart&mdash;body and wheels&mdash;in spare time, out of colonial
    hardwood, and got Little the blacksmith to do the ironwork; I painted the
    cart myself. It wasn&rsquo;t much lighter than one of the tip-drays I had,
    but it <i>was</i> a spring-cart, and Mary pretended to be satisfied with
    it: anyway, I didn&rsquo;t hear any more of the buggy for a while.</p>
  <p>I sold that cart, for fourteen pounds, to a Chinese gardener who wanted
    a strong cart to carry his vegetables round through the Bush. It was just
    before our first youngster came: I told Mary that I wanted the money in case
    of extra expense&mdash;and she didn&rsquo;t fret much at losing that cart.
    But the fact was, that I was going to make another try for a buggy, as a
    present for Mary when the child was born. I thought of getting the turn-out
    while she was laid up, keeping it dark from her till she was on her feet
    again, and then showing her the buggy standing in the shed. But she had a
    bad time, and I had to have the doctor regularly, and get a proper nurse,
    and a lot of things extra; so the buggy idea was knocked on the head. I was
    set on it, too: I&rsquo;d thought of how, when Mary was up and getting strong,
    I&rsquo;d say one morning, &lsquo;Go round and have a look in the shed, Mary;
    I&rsquo;ve got a few fowls for you,&rsquo; or something like that&mdash;  and
    follow her round to watch her eyes when she saw the buggy. I never told Mary
    about that&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t have done any good.</p>
  <p>Later on I got some good timber&mdash;mostly scraps that were given to me&mdash; and
    made a light body for a spring-cart. Galletly, the coach-builder at Cudgeegong,
    had got a dozen pairs of American hickory wheels up from Sydney, for light
    spring-carts, and he let me have a pair for cost price and carriage. I got
    him to iron the cart, and he put it through the paint-shop for nothing. He
    sent it out, too, at the tail of Tom Tarrant&rsquo;s big van&mdash;to increase
    the surprise. We were swells then for a while; I heard no more of a buggy
    until after we&rsquo;d been settled at Lahey&rsquo;s Creek for a couple of
    years.</p>
  <p>I told you how I went into the carrying line, and took up a selection at
    Lahey&rsquo;s Creek&mdash;for a run for the horses and to grow a bit of feed&mdash;  and
    shifted Mary and little Jim out there from Gulgong, with Mary&rsquo;s young
    scamp of a brother James to keep them company while I was on the road. The
    first year I did well enough carrying, but I never cared for it&mdash;it
    was too slow; and, besides, I was always anxious when I was away from home.
    The game was right enough for a single man&mdash;or a married one whose wife
    had got the nagging habit (as many Bushwomen have&mdash;God help &rsquo;em!),
    and who wanted peace and quietness sometimes. Besides, other small carriers
    started (seeing me getting on); and Tom Tarrant, the coach-driver at Cudgeegong,
    had another heavy spring-van built, and put it on the roads, and he took
    a lot of the light stuff.</p>
  <p>The second year I made a rise&mdash;out of &lsquo;spuds&rsquo;, of all the
    things in the world. It was Mary&rsquo;s idea. Down at the lower end of our
    selection&mdash; Mary called it &lsquo;the run&rsquo;&mdash;was a shallow
    watercourse called Snake&rsquo;s Creek, dry most of the year, except for
    a muddy water-hole or two; and, just above the junction, where it ran into
    Lahey&rsquo;s Creek, was a low piece of good black-soil flat, on our side&mdash;about
    three acres. The flat was fairly clear when I came to the selection&mdash; save
    for a few logs that had been washed up there in some big &lsquo;old man&rsquo; flood,
    way back in black-fellows&rsquo; times; and one day, when I had a spell at
    home, I got the horses and trace-chains and dragged the logs together&mdash; those
    that wouldn&rsquo;t split for fencing timber&mdash;and burnt them off. I
    had a notion to get the flat ploughed and make a lucern-paddock of it. There
    was a good water-hole, under a clump of she-oak in the bend, and Mary used
    to take her stools and tubs and boiler down there in the spring-cart in hot
    weather, and wash the clothes under the shade of the trees&mdash;it was cooler,
    and saved carrying water to the house. And one evening after she&rsquo;d
    done the washing she said to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe; the farmers out here never seem to get a new idea:
    they don&rsquo;t seem to me ever to try and find out beforehand what the
    market is going to be like&mdash;they just go on farming the same old way
    and putting in the same old crops year after year. They sow wheat, and, if
    it comes on anything like the thing, they reap and thresh it; if it doesn&rsquo;t,
    they mow it for hay&mdash;  and some of &rsquo;em don&rsquo;t have the brains
    to do that in time. Now, I was looking at that bit of flat you cleared, and
    it struck me that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a half bad idea to get a bag of seed-potatoes,
    and have the land ploughed&mdash;old Corny George would do it cheap&mdash; and
    get them put in at once. Potatoes have been dear all round for the last couple
    of years.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I told her she was talking nonsense, that the ground was no good for potatoes,
    and the whole district was too dry. &lsquo;Everybody I know has tried it,
    one time or another, and made nothing of it,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All the more reason why you should try it, Joe,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;Just
    try one crop. It might rain for weeks, and then you&rsquo;ll be sorry you
    didn&rsquo;t take my advice.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I tell you the ground is not potato-ground,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you know? You haven&rsquo;t sown any there yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve turned up the surface and looked at it. It&rsquo;s
    not rich enough, and too dry, I tell you. You need swampy, boggy ground for
    potatoes. Do you think I don&rsquo;t know land when I see it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you haven&rsquo;t tried to grow potatoes there yet, Joe. How
    do you know&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t listen to any more. Mary was obstinate when she got an idea
    into her head. It was no use arguing with her. All the time I&rsquo;d be
    talking she&rsquo;d just knit her forehead and go on thinking straight ahead,
    on the track she&rsquo;d started,&mdash;just as if I wasn&rsquo;t there,&mdash; and
    it used to make me mad. She&rsquo;d keep driving at me till I took her advice
    or lost my temper,&mdash;I did both at the same time, mostly.</p>
  <p>I took my pipe and went out to smoke and cool down.</p>
  <p>A couple of days after the potato breeze, I started with the team down to
    Cudgeegong for a load of fencing-wire I had to bring out; and after I&rsquo;d
    kissed Mary good-bye, she said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe, if you bring out a bag of seed-potatoes, James and
    I will slice them, and old Corny George down the creek would bring his plough
    up in the dray and plough the ground for very little. We could put the potatoes
    in ourselves if the ground were only ploughed.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I thought she&rsquo;d forgotten all about it. There was no time to argue&mdash; I&rsquo;d
    be sure to lose my temper, and then I&rsquo;d either have to waste an hour
    comforting Mary or go off in a &lsquo;huff&rsquo;, as the women call it,
    and be miserable for the trip. So I said I&rsquo;d see about it. She gave
    me another hug and a kiss.  &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forget, Joe,&rsquo; she said
    as I started. &lsquo;Think it over on the road.&rsquo; I reckon she had the
    best of it that time.</p>
  <p>About five miles along, just as I turned into the main road, I heard some
    one galloping after me, and I saw young James on his hack. I got a start,
    for I thought that something had gone wrong at home. I remember, the first
    day I left Mary on the creek, for the first five or six miles I was half-a-dozen
    times on the point of turning back&mdash; only I thought she&rsquo;d laugh
    at me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, James?&rsquo; I shouted, before he came up&mdash;but
    I saw he was grinning.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mary says to tell you not to forget to bring a hoe out with you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You clear off home!&rsquo; I said, &rsquo;or I&rsquo;ll lay the whip
    about your young hide; and don&rsquo;t come riding after me again as if the
    run was on fire.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t get shirty with me!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t
    want to have anything to do with a hoe.&rsquo; And he rode off.</p>
  <p>I&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;get thinking about those potatoes, though I hadn&rsquo;t
    meant to. I knew of an independent man in that district who&rsquo;d made
    his money out of a crop of potatoes; but that was away back in the roaring &rsquo;Fifties  &mdash;&rsquo;54&mdash;when
    spuds went up to twenty-eight shillings a hundredweight (in Sydney), on account
    of the gold rush. We might get good rain now, and, anyway, it wouldn&rsquo;t
    cost much to put the potatoes in. If they came on well, it would be a few
    pounds in my pocket; if the crop was a failure, I&rsquo;d have a better show
    with Mary next time she was struck by an idea outside housekeeping, and have
    something to grumble about when I felt grumpy.</p>
  <p>I got a couple of bags of potatoes&mdash;we could use those that were left
    over; and I got a small iron plough and a harrow that Little the blacksmith
    had lying in his yard and let me have cheap&mdash;only about a pound more
    than I told Mary I gave for them. When I took advice, I generally made the
    mistake of taking more than was offered, or adding notions of my own. It
    was vanity, I suppose. If the crop came on well I could claim the plough-and-harrow
    part of the idea, anyway. (It didn&rsquo;t strike me that if the crop failed
    Mary would have the plough and harrow against me, for old Corny would plough
    the ground for ten or fifteen shillings.) Anyway, I&rsquo;d want a plough
    and harrow later on, and I might as well get it now; it would give James
    something to do.</p>
  <p>I came out by the western road, by Guntawang, and up the creek home; and
    the first thing I saw was old Corny George ploughing the flat. And Mary was
    down on the bank superintending. She&rsquo;d got James with the trace-chains
    and the spare horses, and had made him clear off every stick and bush where
    another furrow might be squeezed in. Old Corny looked pretty grumpy on it&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    broken all his ploughshares but one, in the roots; and James didn&rsquo;t
    look much brighter. Mary had an old felt hat and a new pair of &rsquo;lastic-side
    boots of mine on, and the boots were covered with clay, for she&rsquo;d been
    down hustling James to get a rotten old stump out of the way by the time
    Corny came round with his next furrow.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought I&rsquo;d make the boots easy for you, Joe,&rsquo; said
    Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mary,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not going
    to growl.&rsquo; Those boots were a bone of contention between us; but she
    generally got them off before I got home.</p>
  <p>Her face fell a little when she saw the plough and harrow in the waggon,
    but I said that would be all right&mdash;we&rsquo;d want a plough anyway.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I thought you wanted old Corny to plough the ground,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never said so.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But when I sent Jim after you about the hoe to put the spuds in,
    you didn&rsquo;t say you wouldn&rsquo;t bring it,&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>I had a few days at home, and entered into the spirit of the thing. When
    Corny was done, James and I cross-ploughed the land, and got a stump or two,
    a big log, and some scrub out of the way at the upper end and added nearly
    an acre, and ploughed that. James was all right at most Bushwork: he&rsquo;d
    bullock so long as the novelty lasted; he liked ploughing or fencing, or
    any graft he could make a show at. He didn&rsquo;t care for grubbing out
    stumps, or splitting posts and rails. We sliced the potatoes of an evening&mdash;and
    there was trouble between Mary and James over cutting through the &lsquo;eyes&rsquo;.
    There was no time for the hoe&mdash;and besides it wasn&rsquo;t a novelty
    to James&mdash; so I just ran furrows and they dropped the spuds in behind
    me, and I turned another furrow over them, and ran the harrow over the ground.
    I think I hilled those spuds, too, with furrows&mdash;or a crop of Indian
    corn I put in later on.</p>
  <p>It rained heavens-hard for over a week: we had regular showers all through,
    and it was the finest crop of potatoes ever seen in the district. I believe
    at first Mary used to slip down at daybreak to see if the potatoes were up;
    and she&rsquo;d write to me about them, on the road. I forget how many bags
    I got; but the few who had grown potatoes in the district sent theirs to
    Sydney, and spuds went up to twelve and fifteen shillings a hundredweight
    in that district. I made a few quid out of mine&mdash;and saved carriage
    too, for I could take them out on the waggon. Then Mary began to hear (through
    James) of a buggy that some one had for sale cheap, or a dogcart that somebody
    else wanted to get rid of&mdash;and let me know about it, in an offhand way.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="JoeWilsonsLuck"></a>II<br>
    Joe Wilson&rsquo;s Luck</b></h3>
  <p>There&nbsp;was good grass on the selection all the year. I&rsquo;d picked
    up a small lot&mdash;about twenty head&mdash;of half-starved steers for next
    to nothing, and turned them on the run; they came on wonderfully, and my
    brother-in-law (Mary&rsquo;s sister&rsquo;s husband), who was running a butchery
    at Gulgong, gave me a good price for them. His carts ran out twenty or thirty
    miles, to little bits of gold-rushes that were going on at th&rsquo; Home
    Rule, Happy Valley, Guntawang, Tallawang, and Cooyal, and those places round
    there, and he was doing well.</p>
  <p>Mary had heard of a light American waggonette, when the steers went&mdash; a
    tray-body arrangement, and she thought she&rsquo;d do with that. &lsquo;It
    would be better than the buggy, Joe,&rsquo; she said&mdash; &lsquo;there&rsquo;d
    be more room for the children, and, besides, I could take butter and eggs
    to Gulgong, or Cobborah, when we get a few more cows.&rsquo; Then James heard
    of a small flock of sheep that a selector&mdash;  who was about starved off
    his selection out Talbragar way&mdash; wanted to get rid of. James reckoned
    he could get them for less than half-a-crown a-head. We&rsquo;d had a heavy
    shower of rain, that came over the ranges and didn&rsquo;t seem to go beyond
    our boundaries. Mary said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity to see all that grass
    going to waste, Joe. Better get those sheep and try your luck with them.
    Leave some money with me, and I&rsquo;ll send James over for them. Never
    mind about the buggy&mdash;  we&rsquo;ll get that when we&rsquo;re on our
    feet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So James rode across to Talbragar and drove a hard bargain with that unfortunate
    selector, and brought the sheep home. There were about two hundred, wethers
    and ewes, and they were young and looked a good breed too, but so poor they
    could scarcely travel; they soon picked up, though. The drought was blazing
    all round and Out-Back, and I think that my corner of the ridges was the
    only place where there was any grass to speak of. We had another shower or
    two, and the grass held out. Chaps began to talk of &lsquo;Joe Wilson&rsquo;s
    luck&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>I would have liked to shear those sheep; but I hadn&rsquo;t time to get
    a shed or anything ready&mdash;along towards Christmas there was a bit of
    a boom in the carrying line. Wethers in wool were going as high as thirteen
    to fifteen shillings at the Homebush yards at Sydney, so I arranged to truck
    the sheep down from the river by rail, with another small lot that was going,
    and I started James off with them. He took the west road, and down Guntawang
    way a big farmer who saw James with the sheep (and who was speculating, or
    adding to his stock, or took a fancy to the wool) offered James as much for
    them as he reckoned I&rsquo;d get in Sydney, after paying the carriage and
    the agents and the auctioneer. James put the sheep in a paddock and rode
    back to me. He was all there where riding was concerned. I told him to let
    the sheep go. James made a Greener shot-gun, and got his saddle done up,
    out of that job.</p>
  <p>I took up a couple more forty-acre blocks&mdash;one in James&rsquo;s name,
    to encourage him with the fencing. There was a good slice of land in an angle
    between the range and the creek, farther down, which everybody thought belonged
    to Wall, the squatter, but Mary got an idea, and went to the local land office
    and found out that it was &rsquo;unoccupied Crown land&rsquo;, and so I took
    it up on pastoral lease, and got a few more sheep&mdash;I&rsquo;d saved some
    of the best-looking ewes from the last lot.</p>
  <p>One evening&mdash;I was going down next day for a load of fencing-wire for
    myself&mdash;Mary said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Joe! do you know that the Matthews have got a new double buggy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Matthews were a big family of cockatoos, along up the main road, and
    I didn&rsquo;t think much of them. The sons were all &lsquo;bad-eggs&rsquo;,
    though the old woman and girls were right enough.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what of that?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re up to their
    neck in debt, and camping like black-fellows in a big bark humpy. They do
    well to go flashing round in a double buggy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But that isn&rsquo;t what I was going to say,&rsquo; said Mary. &lsquo;They
    want to sell their old single buggy, James says. I&rsquo;m sure you could
    get it for six or seven pounds; and you could have it done up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish James to the devil!&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t he find
    anything better to do than ride round after cock-and-bull yarns about buggies?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mary, &lsquo;it was James who got the steers and
    the sheep.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Well, one word led to another, and we said things we didn&rsquo;t mean&mdash;  but
    couldn&rsquo;t forget in a hurry. I remember I said something about Mary
    always dragging me back just when I was getting my head above water and struggling
    to make a home for her and the children; and that hurt her, and she spoke
    of the  &lsquo;homes&rsquo; she&rsquo;d had since she was married. And that
    cut me deep.</p>
  <p>It was about the worst quarrel we had. When she began to cry I got my hat
    and went out and walked up and down by the creek. I hated anything that looked
    like injustice&mdash;I was so sensitive about it that it made me unjust sometimes.
    I tried to think I was right, but I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have made me feel any better if I could have thought so. I got thinking of
    Mary&rsquo;s first year on the selection and the life she&rsquo;d had since
    we were married.</p>
  <p>When I went in she&rsquo;d cried herself to sleep. I bent over and,  &lsquo;Mary,&rsquo; I
    whispered.</p>
  <p>She seemed to wake up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Joe&mdash;Joe!&rsquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it Mary?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m pretty well sure that old Spot&rsquo;s calf isn&rsquo;t
    in the pen. Make James go at once!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Old Spot&rsquo;s last calf was two years old now; so Mary was talking in
    her sleep, and dreaming she was back in her first year.</p>
  <p>We both laughed when I told her about it afterwards; but I didn&rsquo;t
    feel like laughing just then.</p>
  <p>Later on in the night she called out in her sleep,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Joe&mdash;Joe! Put that buggy in the shed, or the sun will blister
    the varnish!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I wish I could say that that was the last time I ever spoke unkindly to
    Mary.</p>
  <p>Next morning I got up early and fried the bacon and made the tea, and took
    Mary&rsquo;s breakfast in to her&mdash;like I used to do, sometimes, when
    we were first married. She didn&rsquo;t say anything&mdash; just pulled my
    head down and kissed me.</p>
  <p>When I was ready to start Mary said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better take the spring-cart in behind the dray and get
    the tyres cut and set. They&rsquo;re ready to drop off, and James has been
    wedging them up till he&rsquo;s tired of it. The last time I was out with
    the children I had to knock one of them back with a stone: there&rsquo;ll
    be an accident yet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So I lashed the shafts of the cart under the tail of the waggon, and mean
    and ridiculous enough the cart looked, going along that way. It suggested
    a man stooping along handcuffed, with his arms held out and down in front
    of him.</p>
  <p>It was dull weather, and the scrubs looked extra dreary and endless&mdash; and
    I got thinking of old things. Everything was going all right with me, but
    that didn&rsquo;t keep me from brooding sometimes&mdash;trying to hatch out
    stones, like an old hen we had at home. I think, taking it all round, I used
    to be happier when I was mostly hard-up&mdash;and more generous. When I had
    ten pounds I was more likely to listen to a chap who said, &lsquo;Lend me
    a pound-note, Joe,&rsquo; than when I had fifty;&nbsp;<i>then</i>&nbsp;I
    fought shy of careless chaps&mdash;and lost mates that I wanted afterwards&mdash; and
    got the name of being mean. When I got a good cheque I&rsquo;d be as miserable
    as a miser over the first ten pounds I spent; but when I got down to the
    last I&rsquo;d buy things for the house. And now that I was getting on, I
    hated to spend a pound on anything. But then, the farther I got away from
    poverty the greater the fear I had of it&mdash;and, besides, there was always
    before us all the thought of the terrible drought, with blazing runs as bare
    and dusty as the road, and dead stock rotting every yard, all along the barren
    creeks.</p>
  <p>I had a long yarn with Mary&rsquo;s sister and her husband that night in
    Gulgong, and it brightened me up. I had a fancy that that sort of a brother-in-law
    made a better mate than a nearer one; Tom Tarrant had one, and he said it
    was sympathy. But while we were yarning I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of
    Mary, out there in the hut on the Creek, with no one to talk to but the children,
    or James, who was sulky at home, or Black Mary or Black Jimmy (our black
    boy&rsquo;s father and mother), who weren&rsquo;t oversentimental. Or maybe
    a selector&rsquo;s wife (the nearest was five miles away), who could talk
    only of two or three things&mdash; &lsquo;lambin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;shearin&rsquo;&rsquo; and &lsquo;cookin&rsquo; for
    the men&rsquo;, and what she said to her old man, and what he said to her&mdash;and
    her own ailments&mdash; over and over again.</p>
  <p>It&rsquo;s a wonder it didn&rsquo;t drive Mary mad!&mdash;I know I could
    never listen to that woman more than an hour. Mary&rsquo;s sister said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now if Mary had a comfortable buggy, she could drive in with the
    children oftener. Then she wouldn&rsquo;t feel the loneliness so much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I said &lsquo;Good night&rsquo; then and turned in. There was no getting
    away from that buggy. Whenever Mary&rsquo;s sister started hinting about
    a buggy, I reckoned it was a put-up job between them.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostofMarysSacrifice"></a>III<br>
    The Ghost of Mary&rsquo;s Sacrifice</b></h3>
  <p>When&nbsp;I got to Gudgeegong I stopped at Galletly&rsquo;s coach-shop to
    leave the cart. The Galletlys were good fellows: there were two brothers&mdash;one
    was a saddler and harness-maker. Big brown-bearded men&mdash;the biggest
    men in the district, &rsquo;twas said.</p>
  <p>Their old man had died lately and left them some money; they had men, and
    only worked in their shops when they felt inclined, or there was a special
    work to do; they were both first-class tradesmen. I went into the painter&rsquo;s
    shop to have a look at a double buggy that Galletly had built for a man who
    couldn&rsquo;t pay cash for it when it was finished&mdash;and Galletly wouldn&rsquo;t
    trust him.</p>
  <p>There it stood, behind a calico screen that the coach-painters used to keep
    out the dust when they were varnishing. It was a first-class piece of work&mdash;pole,
    shafts, cushions, whip, lamps, and all complete. If you only wanted to drive
    one horse you could take out the pole and put in the shafts, and there you
    were. There was a tilt over the front seat; if you only wanted the buggy
    to carry two, you could fold down the back seat, and there you had a handsome,
    roomy, single buggy. It would go near fifty pounds.</p>
  <p>While I was looking at it, Bill Galletly came in, and slapped me on the
    back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, there&rsquo;s a chance for you, Joe!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I
    saw you rubbing your head round that buggy the last time you were in. You
    wouldn&rsquo;t get a better one in the colonies, and you won&rsquo;t see
    another like it in the district again in a hurry&mdash;for it doesn&rsquo;t
    pay to build &rsquo;em. Now you&rsquo;re a full-blown squatter, and it&rsquo;s
    time you took little Mary for a fly round in her own buggy now and then,
    instead of having her stuck out there in the scrub, or jolting through the
    dust in a cart like some old Mother Flourbag.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He called her &lsquo;little Mary&rsquo; because the Galletly family had
    known her when she was a girl.</p>
  <p>I rubbed my head and looked at the buggy again. It was a great temptation.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Joe,&rsquo; said Bill Galletly in a quieter tone. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll let&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;have the
    buggy. You can take it out and send along a bit of a cheque when you feel
    you can manage it, and the rest later on,&mdash; a year will do, or even
    two years. You&rsquo;ve had a hard pull, and I&rsquo;m not likely to be hard
    up for money in a hurry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They were good fellows the Galletlys, but they knew their men. I happened
    to know that Bill Galletly wouldn&rsquo;t let the man he built the buggy
    for take it out of the shop without cash down, though he was a big-bug round
    there. But that didn&rsquo;t make it easier for me.</p>
  <p>Just then Robert Galletly came into the shop. He was rather quieter than
    his brother, but the two were very much alike.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Bob,&rsquo; said Bill; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a chance for
    you to get rid of your harness. Joe Wilson&rsquo;s going to take that buggy
    off my hands.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Bob Galletly put his foot up on a saw-stool, took one hand out of his pockets,
    rested his elbow on his knee and his chin on the palm of his hand, and bunched
    up his big beard with his fingers, as he always did when he was thinking.
    Presently he took his foot down, put his hand back in his pocket, and said
    to me, &lsquo;Well, Joe, I&rsquo;ve got a double set of harness made for
    the man who ordered that damned buggy, and if you like I&rsquo;ll let you
    have it. I suppose when Bill there has squeezed all he can out of you I&rsquo;ll
    stand a show of getting something. He&rsquo;s a regular Shylock, he is.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I pushed my hat forward and rubbed the back of my head and stared at the
    buggy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come across to the Royal, Joe,&rsquo; said Bob.</p>
  <p>But I knew that a beer would settle the business, so I said I&rsquo;d get
    the wool up to the station first and think it over, and have a drink when
    I came back.</p>
  <p>I thought it over on the way to the station, but it didn&rsquo;t seem good
    enough. I wanted to get some more sheep, and there was the new run to be
    fenced in, and the instalments on the selections. I wanted lots of things
    that I couldn&rsquo;t well do without. Then, again, the farther I got away
    from debt and hard-upedness the greater the horror I had of it. I had two
    horses that would do; but I&rsquo;d have to get another later on, and altogether
    the buggy would run me nearer a hundred than fifty pounds. Supposing a dry
    season threw me back with that buggy on my hands. Besides, I wanted a spell.
    If I got the buggy it would only mean an extra turn of hard graft for me.
    No, I&rsquo;d take Mary for a trip to Sydney, and she&rsquo;d have to be
    satisfied with that.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d got it settled, and was just turning in through the big white
    gates to the goods-shed when young Black, the squatter, dashed past the station
    in his big new waggonette, with his wife and a driver and a lot of portmanteaus
    and rugs and things. They were going to do the grand in Sydney over Christmas.
    Now it was young Black who was so shook after Mary when she was in service
    with the Blacks before the old man died, and if I hadn&rsquo;t come along&mdash; and
    if girls never cared for vagabonds&mdash;Mary would have been mistress of
    Haviland homestead, with servants to wait on her; and she was far better
    fitted for it than the one that was there. She would have been going to Sydney
    every holiday and putting up at the old Royal, with every comfort that a
    woman could ask for, and seeing a play every night. And I&rsquo;d have been
    knocking around amongst the big stations Out-Back, or maybe drinking myself
    to death at the shanties.</p>
  <p>The Blacks didn&rsquo;t see me as I went by, ragged and dusty, and with
    an old, nearly black, cabbage-tree hat drawn over my eyes. I didn&rsquo;t
    care a damn for them, or any one else, at most times, but I had moods when
    I felt things.</p>
  <p>One of Black&rsquo;s big wool teams was just coming away from the shed,
    and the driver, a big, dark, rough fellow, with some foreign blood in him,
    didn&rsquo;t seem inclined to wheel his team an inch out of the middle of
    the road. I stopped my horses and waited. He looked at me and I looked at
    him&mdash;hard. Then he wheeled off, scowling, and swearing at his horses.
    I&rsquo;d given him a hiding, six or seven years before, and he hadn&rsquo;t
    forgotten it. And I felt then as if I wouldn&rsquo;t mind trying to give
    some one a hiding.</p>
  <p>The goods clerk must have thought that Joe Wilson was pretty grumpy that
    day. I was thinking of Mary, out there in the lonely hut on a barren creek
    in the Bush&mdash;for it was little better&mdash;with no one to speak to
    except a haggard, worn-out Bushwoman or two, that came to see her on Sunday.
    I thought of the hardships she went through in the first year&mdash; that
    I haven&rsquo;t told you about yet; of the time she was ill, and I away,
    and no one to understand; of the time she was alone with James and Jim sick;
    and of the loneliness she fought through out there. I thought of Mary, outside
    in the blazing heat, with an old print dress and a felt hat, and a pair of &rsquo;lastic-siders
    of mine on, doing the work of a station manager as well as that of a housewife
    and mother. And her cheeks were getting thin, and her colour was going: I
    thought of the gaunt, brick-brown, saw-file voiced, hopeless and spiritless
    Bushwomen I knew&mdash;and some of them not much older than Mary.</p>
  <p>When I went back down into the town, I had a drink with Bill Galletly at
    the Royal, and that settled the buggy; then Bob shouted, and I took the harness.
    Then I shouted, to wet the bargain. When I was going, Bob said,  &lsquo;Send
    in that young scamp of a brother of Mary&rsquo;s with the horses: if the
    collars don&rsquo;t fit I&rsquo;ll fix up a pair of makeshifts, and alter
    the others.&rsquo; I thought they both gripped my hand harder than usual,
    but that might have been the beer.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="TheBuggyComesHome"></a>IV<br>
    The Buggy Comes Home</b></h3>
  <p>I&nbsp;&lsquo;whipped the cat&rsquo; a bit, the first twenty miles or so,
    but then, I thought, what did it matter? What was the use of grinding to
    save money until we were too old to enjoy it. If we had to go down in the
    world again, we might as well fall out of a buggy as out of a dray&mdash; there&rsquo;d
    be some talk about it, anyway, and perhaps a little sympathy. When Mary had
    the buggy she wouldn&rsquo;t be tied down so much to that wretched hole in
    the Bush; and the Sydney trips needn&rsquo;t be off either. I could drive
    down to Wallerawang on the main line, where Mary had some people, and leave
    the buggy and horses there, and take the train to Sydney; or go right on,
    by the old coach-road, over the Blue Mountains: it would be a grand drive.
    I thought best to tell Mary&rsquo;s sister at Gulgong about the buggy; I
    told her I&rsquo;d keep it dark from Mary till the buggy came home. She entered
    into the spirit of the thing, and said she&rsquo;d give the world to be able
    to go out with the buggy, if only to see Mary open her eyes when she saw
    it; but she couldn&rsquo;t go, on account of a new baby she had. I was rather
    glad she couldn&rsquo;t, for it would spoil the surprise a little, I thought.
    I wanted that all to myself.</p>
  <p>I got home about sunset next day, and, after tea, when I&rsquo;d finished
    telling Mary all the news, and a few lies as to why I didn&rsquo;t bring
    the cart back, and one or two other things, I sat with James, out on a log
    of the wood-heap, where we generally had our smokes and interviews, and told
    him all about the buggy. He whistled, then he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what do you want to make it such a Bushranging business for?
    Why can&rsquo;t you tell Mary now? It will cheer her up. She&rsquo;s been
    pretty miserable since you&rsquo;ve been away this trip.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want it to be a surprise,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to say against a surprise, out in a
    hole like this; but it &rsquo;ud take a lot to surprise me. What am I to
    say to Mary about taking the two horses in? I&rsquo;ll only want one to bring
    the cart out, and she&rsquo;s sure to ask.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell her you&rsquo;re going to get yours shod.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But he had a set of slippers only the other day. She knows as much
    about horses as we do. I don&rsquo;t mind telling a lie so long as a chap
    has only got to tell a straight lie and be done with it. But Mary asks so
    many questions.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, drive the other horse up the creek early, and pick him up as
    you go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. And she&rsquo;ll want to know what I want with two bridles.
    But I&rsquo;ll fix her&mdash;<i>you</i>&nbsp;needn&rsquo;t worry.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And, James,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;get a chamois leather and sponge&mdash; we&rsquo;ll
    want &rsquo;em anyway&mdash;and you might give the buggy a wash down in the
    creek, coming home. It&rsquo;s sure to be covered with dust.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh!&mdash;orlright.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And if you can, time yourself to get here in the cool of the evening,
    or just about sunset.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d thought it would be better to have the buggy there in the cool
    of the evening, when Mary would have time to get excited and get over it&mdash;better
    than in the blazing hot morning, when the sun rose as hot as at noon, and
    we&rsquo;d have the long broiling day before us.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What do you want me to come at sunset for?&rsquo; asked James. &lsquo;Do
    you want me to camp out in the scrub and turn up like a blooming sundowner?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;get here at midnight if you like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We didn&rsquo;t say anything for a while&mdash;just sat and puffed at our
    pipes. Then I said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what are you thinking about?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m thinking it&rsquo;s time you got a new hat, the sun seems
    to get in through your old one too much,&rsquo; and he got out of my reach
    and went to see about penning the calves. Before we turned in he said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what am I to get out of the job, Joe?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He had his eye on a double-barrel gun that Franca the gunsmith in Cudgeegong
    had&mdash;one barrel shot, and the other rifle; so I said,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How much does Franca want for that gun?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Five-ten; but I think he&rsquo;d take my single barrel off it. Anyway,
    I can squeeze a couple of quid out of Phil Lambert for the single barrel.&rsquo;  (Phil
    was his bosom chum.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Make the best bargain you can.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He got his own breakfast and made an early start next morning, to get clear
    of any instructions or messages that Mary might have forgotten to give him
    overnight. He took his gun with him.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d always thought that a man was a fool who couldn&rsquo;t keep a
    secret from his wife&mdash;that there was something womanish about him. I
    found out. Those three days waiting for the buggy were about the longest
    I ever spent in my life. It made me scotty with every one and everything;
    and poor Mary had to suffer for it. I put in the time patching up the harness
    and mending the stockyard and the roof, and, the third morning, I rode up
    the ridges to look for trees for fencing-timber. I remember I hurried home
    that afternoon because I thought the buggy might get there before me.</p>
  <p>At tea-time I got Mary on to the buggy business.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of a single buggy to you, Mary?&rsquo; I asked.  &lsquo;There&rsquo;s
    only room for two, and what are you going to do with the children when we
    go out together?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We can put them on the floor at our feet, like other people do. I
    can always fold up a blanket or &rsquo;possum rug for them to sit on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But she didn&rsquo;t take half so much interest in buggy talk as she would
    have taken at any other time, when I didn&rsquo;t want her to. Women are
    aggravating that way. But the poor girl was tired and not very well, and
    both the children were cross. She did look knocked up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll give the buggy a rest, Joe,&rsquo; she said. (I thought
    I heard it coming then.) &lsquo;It seems as far off as ever. I don&rsquo;t
    know why you want to harp on it to-day. Now, don&rsquo;t look so cross, Joe&mdash; I
    didn&rsquo;t mean to hurt you. We&rsquo;ll wait until we can get a double
    buggy, since you&rsquo;re so set on it. There&rsquo;ll be plenty of time
    when we&rsquo;re better off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After tea, when the youngsters were in bed, and she&rsquo;d washed up, we
    sat outside on the edge of the verandah floor, Mary sewing, and I smoking
    and watching the track up the creek.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you talk, Joe?&rsquo; asked Mary. &lsquo;You scarcely
    ever speak to me now: it&rsquo;s like drawing blood out of a stone to get
    a word from you. What makes you so cross, Joe?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve got nothing to say.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you should find something. Think of me&mdash;it&rsquo;s very
    miserable for me. Have you anything on your mind? Is there any new trouble?
    Better tell me, no matter what it is, and not go worrying and brooding and
    making both our lives miserable. If you never tell one anything, how can
    you expect me to understand?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I said there was nothing the matter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But there must be, to make you so unbearable. Have you been drinking,
    Joe&mdash; or gambling?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I asked her what she&rsquo;d accuse me of next.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And another thing I want to speak to you about,&rsquo; she went on.  &lsquo;Now,
    don&rsquo;t knit up your forehead like that, Joe, and get impatient&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what is it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t swear in the hearing of the children. Now,
    little Jim to-day, he was trying to fix his little go-cart and it wouldn&rsquo;t
    run right, and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, what did he say?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo; (she seemed a little hysterical, trying not to
    laugh)&mdash; &lsquo;he said &ldquo;damn it!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I had to laugh. Mary tried to keep serious, but it was no use.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never mind, old woman,&rsquo; I said, putting an arm round her, for
    her mouth was trembling, and she was crying more than laughing. &lsquo;It
    won&rsquo;t be always like this. Just wait till we&rsquo;re a bit better
    off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Just then a black boy we had (I must tell you about him some other time)
    came sidling along by the wall, as if he were afraid somebody was going to
    hit him&mdash;poor little devil! I never did.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What is it, Harry?&rsquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Buggy comin&rsquo;, I bin thinkit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He pointed up the creek.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Sure it&rsquo;s a buggy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, missus.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How many horses?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One&mdash;two.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We knew that he could hear and see things long before we could. Mary went
    and perched on the wood-heap, and shaded her eyes&mdash; though the sun had
    gone&mdash;and peered through between the eternal grey trunks of the stunted
    trees on the flat across the creek. Presently she jumped down and came running
    in.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s some one coming in a buggy, Joe!&rsquo; she cried,
    excitedly.  &lsquo;And both my white table-cloths are rough dry. Harry! put
    two flat-irons down to the fire, quick, and put on some more wood. It&rsquo;s
    lucky I kept those new sheets packed away. Get up out of that, Joe! What
    are you sitting grinning like that for? Go and get on another shirt. Hurry&mdash;Why!
    It&rsquo;s only James&mdash;by himself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She stared at me, and I sat there, grinning like a fool.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Joe!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;whose buggy is that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose it&rsquo;s yours,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>She caught her breath, and stared at the buggy and then at me again. James
    drove down out of sight into the crossing, and came up close to the house.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Joe! what have you done?&rsquo; cried Mary. &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
    a new double buggy!&rsquo; Then she rushed at me and hugged my head. &lsquo;Why
    didn&rsquo;t you tell me, Joe? You poor old boy!&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve been
    nagging at you all day!&rsquo; and she hugged me again.</p>
  <p>James got down and started taking the horses out&mdash;as if it was an everyday
    occurrence. I saw the double-barrel gun sticking out from under the seat.
    He&rsquo;d stopped to wash the buggy, and I suppose that&rsquo;s what made
    him grumpy. Mary stood on the verandah, with her eyes twice as big as usual,
    and breathing hard&mdash; taking the buggy in.</p>
  <p>James skimmed the harness off, and the horses shook themselves and went
    down to the dam for a drink. &lsquo;You&rsquo;d better look under the seats,&rsquo; growled
    James, as he took his gun out with great care.</p>
  <p>Mary dived for the buggy. There was a dozen of lemonade and ginger-beer
    in a candle-box from Galletly&mdash;James said that Galletly&rsquo;s men
    had a gallon of beer, and they cheered him, James (I suppose he meant they
    cheered the buggy), as he drove off; there was a &lsquo;little bit of a ham&rsquo; from
    Pat Murphy, the storekeeper at Home Rule, that he&rsquo;d &rsquo;cured himself&rsquo;&mdash; it
    was the biggest I ever saw; there were three loaves of baker&rsquo;s bread,
    a cake, and a dozen yards of something &lsquo;to make up for the children&rsquo;,
    from Aunt Gertrude at Gulgong; there was a fresh-water cod, that long Dave
    Regan had caught the night before in the Macquarie river, and sent out packed
    in salt in a box; there was a holland suit for the black boy, with red braid
    to trim it; and there was a jar of preserved ginger, and some lollies (sweets)
    (&lsquo;for the lil&rsquo; boy&rsquo;), and a rum-looking Chinese doll and
    a rattle (&lsquo;for lil&rsquo; girl&rsquo;) from Sun Tong Lee, our storekeeper
    at Gulgong&mdash;James was chummy with Sun Tong Lee, and got his powder and
    shot and caps there on tick when he was short of money. And James said that
    the people would have loaded the buggy with &lsquo;rubbish&rsquo; if he&rsquo;d
    waited. They all seemed glad to see Joe Wilson getting on&mdash;and these
    things did me good.</p>
  <p>We got the things inside, and I don&rsquo;t think either of us knew what
    we were saying or doing for the next half-hour. Then James put his head in
    and said, in a very injured tone,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What about my tea? I ain&rsquo;t had anything to speak of since I
    left Cudgeegong. I want some grub.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then Mary pulled herself together.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have your tea directly,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Pick
    up that harness at once, and hang it on the pegs in the skillion; and you,
    Joe, back that buggy under the end of the verandah, the dew will be on it
    presently&mdash; and we&rsquo;ll put wet bags up in front of it to-morrow,
    to keep the sun off. And James will have to go back to Cudgeegong for the
    cart,&mdash; we can&rsquo;t have that buggy to knock about in.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said James&mdash;&lsquo;anything! Only get me some
    grub.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mary fried the fish, in case it wouldn&rsquo;t keep till the morning, and
    rubbed over the tablecloths, now the irons were hot&mdash;James growling
    all the time&mdash;and got out some crockery she had packed away that had
    belonged to her mother, and set the table in a style that made James uncomfortable.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want some grub&mdash;not a blooming banquet!&rsquo; he said. And
    he growled a lot because Mary wanted him to eat his fish without a knife, &lsquo;and
    that sort of Tommy-rot.&rsquo; When he&rsquo;d finished he took his gun,
    and the black boy, and the dogs, and went out &rsquo;possum-shooting.</p>
  <p>When we were alone Mary climbed into the buggy to try the seat, and made
    me get up alongside her. We hadn&rsquo;t had such a comfortable seat for
    years; but we soon got down, in case any one came by, for we began to feel
    like a pair of fools up there.</p>
  <p>Then we sat, side by side, on the edge of the verandah, and talked more
    than we&rsquo;d done for years&mdash;and there was a good deal of &lsquo;Do
    you remember?&rsquo;  in it&mdash;and I think we got to understand each other
    better that night.</p>
  <p>And at last Mary said, &lsquo;Do you know, Joe, why, I feel to-night just&mdash; just
    like I did the day we were married.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And somehow I had that strange, shy sort of feeling too.</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b>Joe Wilson&rsquo;s Mates </b></h1>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGoldenGraveyard"></a>The Golden Graveyard</b></h2>
  <p>Mother Middleton&nbsp;was an awful woman, an &lsquo;old hand&rsquo;  (transported
    convict) some said. The prefix &lsquo;mother&rsquo; in Australia mostly means  &lsquo;old
    hag&rsquo;, and is applied in that sense. In early boyhood we understood,
    from old diggers, that Mother Middleton&mdash;in common with most other &lsquo;old
    hands&rsquo;&mdash;had been sent out for &lsquo;knocking a donkey off a hen-roost.&rsquo; We
    had never seen a donkey. She drank like a fish and swore like a trooper when
    the spirit moved her; she went on periodical sprees, and swore on most occasions.
    There was a fearsome yarn, which impressed us greatly as boys, to the effect
    that once, in her best (or worst) days, she had pulled a mounted policeman
    off his horse, and half-killed him with a heavy pick-handle, which she used
    for poking down clothes in her boiler. She said that he had insulted her.</p>
  <p>She could still knock down a tree and cut a load of firewood with any Bushman;
    she was square and muscular, with arms like a navvy&rsquo;s; she had often
    worked shifts, below and on top, with her husband, when he&rsquo;d be putting
    down a prospecting shaft without a mate, as he often had to do&mdash;because
    of her mainly. Old diggers said that it was lovely to see how she&rsquo;d
    spin up a heavy green-hide bucket full of clay and &lsquo;tailings&rsquo;,
    and land and empty it with a twist of her wrist. Most men were afraid of
    her, and few diggers&rsquo; wives were strong-minded enough to seek a second
    row with Mother Middleton. Her voice could be heard right across Golden Gully
    and Specimen Flat, whether raised in argument or in friendly greeting. She
    came to the old Pipeclay diggings with the &lsquo;rough crowd&rsquo; (mostly
    Irish), and when the old and new Pipeclays were worked out, she went with
    the rush to Gulgong (about the last of the great alluvial or &lsquo;poor-man&rsquo;s&rsquo; goldfields)
    and came back to Pipeclay when the Log Paddock goldfield &lsquo;broke out&rsquo;,
    adjacent to the old fields, and so helped prove the truth of the old digger&rsquo;s
    saying, that no matter how thoroughly ground has been worked, there is always
    room for a new Ballarat.</p>
  <p>Jimmy Middleton died at Log Paddock, and was buried, about the last, in
    the little old cemetery&mdash;appertaining to the old farming town on the
    river, about four miles away&mdash;which adjoined the district racecourse,
    in the Bush, on the far edge of Specimen Flat. She conducted the funeral.
    Some said she made the coffin, and there were alleged jokes to the effect
    that her tongue had provided the corpse; but this, I think, was unfair and
    cruel, for she loved Jimmy Middleton in her awful way, and was, for all I
    ever heard to the contrary, a good wife to him. She then lived in a hut in
    Log Paddock, on a little money in the bank, and did sewing and washing for
    single diggers.</p>
  <p>I remember hearing her one morning in neighbourly conversation, carried
    on across the gully, with a selector, Peter Olsen, who was hopelessly slaving
    to farm a dusty patch in the scrub.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you chuck up that dust-hole and go up country and
    settle on good land, Peter Olsen? You&rsquo;re only slaving your stomach
    out here.&rsquo;  (She didn&rsquo;t say stomach.)</p>
  <p>Peter Olsen (mild-whiskered little man, afraid of his wife): &lsquo;But
    then you know my wife is so delicate, Mrs Middleton. I wouldn&rsquo;t like
    to take her out in the Bush.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Middleton: &lsquo;Delicate, be damned! she&rsquo;s only shamming!&rsquo; (at
    her loudest.) &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you kick her off the bed and the book
    out of her hand, and make her go to work? She&rsquo;s as delicate as I am.
    Are you a man, Peter Olsen, or a&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This for the edification of the wife and of all within half a mile.</p>
  <p>Long Paddock was &lsquo;petering&rsquo;. There were a few claims still being
    worked down at the lowest end, where big, red-and-white waste-heaps of clay
    and gravel, rising above the blue-grey gum-bushes, advertised deep sinking;
    and little, yellow, clay-stained streams, running towards the creek over
    the drought-parched surface, told of trouble with the water below&mdash;time
    lost in baling and extra expense in timbering. And diggers came up with their
    flannels and moleskins yellow and heavy, and dripping with wet &lsquo;mullock&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>Most of the diggers had gone to other fields, but there were a few prospecting,
    in parties and singly, out on the flats and amongst the ridges round Pipeclay.
    Sinking holes in search of a new Ballarat.</p>
  <p>Dave Regan&mdash;lanky, easy-going Bush native; Jim Bently&mdash; a bit
    of a  &lsquo;Flash Jack&rsquo;; and Andy Page&mdash;a character like what &lsquo;Kit&rsquo; (in
    the Old Curiosity Shop) might have been after a voyage to Australia and some
    Colonial experience. These three were mates from habit and not necessity,
    for it was all shallow sinking where they worked. They were poking down pot-holes
    in the scrub in the vicinity of the racecourse, where the sinking was from
    ten to fifteen feet.</p>
  <p>Dave had theories&mdash;&lsquo;ideers&rsquo; or &lsquo;notions&rsquo; he
    called them; Jim Bently laid claim to none&mdash;he ran by sight, not scent,
    like a kangaroo-dog. Andy Page&mdash;by the way, great admirer and faithful
    retainer of Dave Regan&mdash; was simple and trusting, but, on critical occasions,
    he was apt to be obstinately, uncomfortably, exasperatingly truthful, honest,
    and he had reverence for higher things.</p>
  <p>Dave thought hard all one quiet drowsy Sunday afternoon, and next morning
    he, as head of the party, started to sink a hole as close to the cemetery
    fence as he dared. It was a nice quiet spot in the thick scrub, about three
    panels along the fence from the farthest corner post from the road. They
    bottomed here at nine feet, and found encouraging indications. They &lsquo;drove&rsquo;  (tunnelled)
    inwards at right angles to the fence, and at a point immediately beneath
    it they were &lsquo;making tucker&rsquo;; a few feet farther and they were
    making wages. The old alluvial bottom sloped gently that way. The bottom
    here, by the way, was shelving, brownish, rotten rock.</p>
  <p>Just inside the cemetery fence, and at right angles to Dave&rsquo;s drive,
    lay the shell containing all that was left of the late fiercely lamented
    James Middleton, with older graves close at each end. A grave was supposed
    to be six feet deep, and local gravediggers had been conscientious. The old
    alluvial bottom sloped from nine to fifteen feet here.</p>
  <p>Dave worked the ground all round from the bottom of his shaft, timbering&mdash;i.e.,
    putting in a sapling prop&mdash;here and there where he worked wide; but
    the &lsquo;payable dirt&rsquo; ran in under the cemetery, and in no other
    direction.</p>
  <p>Dave, Jim, and Andy held a consultation in camp over their pipes after tea,
    as a result of which Andy next morning rolled up his swag, sorrowfully but
    firmly shook hands with Dave and Jim, and started to tramp Out-Back to look
    for work on a sheep-station.</p>
  <p>This was Dave&rsquo;s theory&mdash;drawn from a little experience and many
    long yarns with old diggers:&mdash;</p>
  <p>He had bottomed on a slope to an old original water-course, covered with
    clay and gravel from the hills by centuries of rains to the depth of from
    nine or ten to twenty feet; he had bottomed on a gutter running into the
    bed of the old buried creek, and carrying patches and streaks of &lsquo;wash&rsquo; or
    gold-bearing dirt. If he went on he might strike it rich at any stroke of
    his pick; he might strike the rich &lsquo;lead&rsquo; which was supposed
    to exist round there. (There was always supposed to be a rich lead round
    there somewhere. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s gold in them ridges yet&mdash;if a
    man can only git at it,&rsquo; says the toothless old relic of the Roaring
    Days.)</p>
  <p>Dave might strike a ledge, &lsquo;pocket&rsquo;, or &lsquo;pot-hole&rsquo; holding
    wash rich with gold. He had prospected on the opposite side of the cemetery,
    found no gold, and the bottom sloping upwards towards the graveyard. He had
    prospected at the back of the cemetery, found a few &lsquo;colours&rsquo;,
    and the bottom sloping downwards towards the point under the cemetery towards
    which all indications were now leading him. He had sunk shafts across the
    road opposite the cemetery frontage and found the sinking twenty feet and
    not a colour of gold. Probably the whole of the ground under the cemetery
    was rich&mdash;maybe the richest in the district. The old gravediggers had
    not been gold-diggers&mdash;besides, the graves, being six feet, would, none
    of them, have touched the alluvial bottom. There was nothing strange in the
    fact that none of the crowd of experienced diggers who rushed the district
    had thought of the cemetery and racecourse. Old brick chimneys and houses,
    the clay for the bricks of which had been taken from sites of subsequent
    goldfields, had been put through the crushing-mill in subsequent years and
    had yielded &lsquo;payable gold&rsquo;. Fossicking Chinamen were said to
    have been the first to detect a case of this kind.</p>
  <p>Dave reckoned to strike the &lsquo;lead&rsquo;, or a shelf or ledge with
    a good streak of wash lying along it, at a point about forty feet within
    the cemetery. But a theory in alluvial gold-mining was much like a theory
    in gambling, in some respects. The theory might be right enough, but old
    volcanic disturbances&mdash; &lsquo;the shrinkage of the earth&rsquo;s surface,&rsquo; and
    that sort of old thing&mdash; upset everything. You might follow good gold
    along a ledge, just under the grass, till it suddenly broke off and the continuation
    might be a hundred feet or so under your nose.</p>
  <p>Had the &lsquo;ground&rsquo; in the cemetery been &rsquo;open&rsquo; Dave
    would have gone to the point under which he expected the gold to lie, sunk
    a shaft there, and worked the ground. It would have been the quickest and
    easiest way&mdash;it would have saved the labour and the time lost in dragging
    heavy buckets of dirt along a low lengthy drive to the shaft outside the
    fence. But it was very doubtful if the Government could have been moved to
    open the cemetery even on the strongest evidence of the existence of a rich
    goldfield under it, and backed by the influence of a number of diggers and
    their backers&mdash; which last was what Dave wished for least of all. He
    wanted, above all things, to keep the thing shady. Then, again, the old clannish
    local spirit of the old farming town, rooted in years way back of the goldfields,
    would have been too strong for the Government, or even a rush of wild diggers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll work this thing on the strict Q.T.,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>He and Jim had a consultation by the camp fire outside their tent. Jim grumbled,
    in conclusion,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, then, best go under Jimmy Middleton. It&rsquo;s the shortest
    and straightest, and Jimmy&rsquo;s the freshest, anyway.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then there was another trouble. How were they to account for the size of
    the waste-heap of clay on the surface which would be the result of such an
    extraordinary length of drive or tunnel for shallow sinkings? Dave had an
    idea of carrying some of the dirt away by night and putting it down a deserted
    shaft close by; but that would double the labour, and might lead to detection
    sooner than anything else. There were boys &rsquo;possum-hunting on those
    flats every night. Then Dave got an idea.</p>
  <p>There was supposed to exist&mdash;and it has since been proved&mdash; another,
    a second gold-bearing alluvial bottom on that field, and several had tried
    for it. One, the town watchmaker, had sunk all his money in &lsquo;duffers&rsquo;,
    trying for the second bottom. It was supposed to exist at a depth of from
    eighty to a hundred feet&mdash; on solid rock, I suppose. This watchmaker,
    an Italian, would put men on to sink, and superintend in person, and whenever
    he came to a little  &lsquo;colour&rsquo;-showing shelf, or false bottom,
    thirty or forty feet down&mdash;he&rsquo;d go rooting round and spoil the
    shaft, and then start to sink another. It was extraordinary that he hadn&rsquo;t
    the sense to sink straight down, thoroughly test the second bottom, and if
    he found no gold there, to fill the shaft up to the other bottoms, or build
    platforms at the proper level and then explore them. He was living in a lunatic
    asylum the last time I heard of him. And the last time I heard from that
    field, they were boring the ground like a sieve, with the latest machinery,
    to find the best place to put down a deep shaft, and finding gold from the
    second bottom on the bore. But I&rsquo;m right off the line again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Old Pinter&rsquo;, Ballarat digger&mdash;his theory on second and
    other bottoms ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ye see,&nbsp;<i>this</i>&nbsp;here grass surface&mdash;this here
    surface with trees an&rsquo; grass on it, that we&rsquo;re livin&rsquo; on,
    has got nothin&rsquo; to do with us. This here bottom in the shaller sinkin&rsquo;s
    that we&rsquo;re workin&rsquo; on is the slope to the bed of the&nbsp;<i>new</i>&nbsp;crick
    that was on the surface about the time that men was missin&rsquo; links.
    The false bottoms, thirty or forty feet down, kin be said to have been on
    the surface about the time that men was monkeys. The&nbsp;<i>secon&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;bottom&mdash; eighty
    or a hundred feet down&mdash;was on the surface about the time when men was
    frogs. Now&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But it&rsquo;s with the missing-link surface we have to do, and had the
    friends of the local departed known what Dave and Jim were up to they would
    have regarded them as something lower than missing-links.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll give out we&rsquo;re tryin&rsquo; for the second bottom,&rsquo; said
    Dave Regan. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have to rig a fan for air, anyhow, and you
    don&rsquo;t want air in shallow sinkings.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And some one will come poking round, and look down the hole and see
    the bottom,&rsquo; said Jim Bently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We must keep &rsquo;em away,&rsquo; said Dave. &lsquo;Tar the bottom,
    or cover it with tarred canvas, to make it black. Then they won&rsquo;t see
    it. There&rsquo;s not many diggers left, and the rest are going; they&rsquo;re
    chucking up the claims in Log Paddock. Besides, I could get drunk and pick
    rows with the rest and they wouldn&rsquo;t come near me. The farmers ain&rsquo;t
    in love with us diggers, so they won&rsquo;t bother us. No man has a right
    to come poking round another man&rsquo;s claim: it ain&rsquo;t ettykit&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    root up that old ettykit and stand to it&mdash; it&rsquo;s rather worn out
    now, but that&rsquo;s no matter. We&rsquo;ll shift the tent down near the
    claim and see that no one comes nosing round on Sunday. They&rsquo;ll think
    we&rsquo;re only some more second-bottom lunatics, like Francea [the mining
    watchmaker]. We&rsquo;re going to get our fortune out from under that old
    graveyard, Jim. You leave it all to me till you&rsquo;re born again with
    brains.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dave&rsquo;s schemes were always elaborate, and that was why they so often
    came to the ground. He logged up his windlass platform a little higher, bent
    about eighty feet of rope to the bole of the windlass, which was a new one,
    and thereafter, whenever a suspicious-looking party (that is to say, a digger)
    hove in sight, Dave would let down about forty feet of rope and then wind,
    with simulated exertion, until the slack was taken up and the rope lifted
    the bucket from the shallow bottom.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would look better to have a whip-pole and a horse, but we can&rsquo;t
    afford them just yet,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>But I&rsquo;m a little behind. They drove straight in under the cemetery,
    finding good wash all the way. The edge of Jimmy Middleton&rsquo;s box appeared
    in the top corner of the &lsquo;face&rsquo; (the working end) of the drive.
    They went under the butt-end of the grave. They shoved up the end of the
    shell with a prop, to prevent the possibility of an accident which might
    disturb the mound above; they puddled&mdash;i.e., rammed&mdash; stiff clay
    up round the edges to keep the loose earth from dribbling down; and having
    given the bottom of the coffin a good coat of tar, they got over, or rather
    under, an unpleasant matter.</p>
  <p>Jim Bently smoked and burnt paper during his shift below, and grumbled a
    good deal. &lsquo;Blowed if I ever thought I&rsquo;d be rooting for gold
    down among the blanky dead men,&rsquo; he said. But the dirt panned out better
    every dish they washed, and Dave worked the &lsquo;wash&rsquo; out right
    and left as they drove.</p>
  <p>But, one fine morning, who should come along but the very last man whom
    Dave wished to see round there&mdash;&lsquo;Old Pinter&rsquo; (James Poynton),
    Californian and Victorian digger of the old school. He&rsquo;d been prospecting
    down the creek, carried his pick over his shoulder&mdash;threaded through
    the eye in the heft of his big-bladed, short-handled shovel that hung behind&mdash; and
    his gold-dish under his arm.</p>
  <p>I mightn&rsquo;t get a chance again to explain what a gold-dish and what
    gold-washing is. A gold washing-dish is a flat dish&mdash; nearer the shape
    of a bedroom bath-tub than anything else I have seen in England, or the dish
    we used for setting milk&mdash; I don&rsquo;t know whether the same is used
    here: the gold-dish measures, say, eighteen inches across the top. You get
    it full of wash dirt, squat down at a convenient place at the edge of the
    water-hole, where there is a rest for the dish in the water just below its
    own depth. You sink the dish and let the clay and gravel soak a while, then
    you work and rub it up with your hands, and as the clay dissolves, dish it
    off as muddy water or mullock. You are careful to wash the pebbles in case
    there is any gold sticking to them. And so till all the muddy or clayey matter
    is gone, and there is nothing but clean gravel in the bottom of the dish.
    You work this off carefully, turning the dish about this way and that and
    swishing the water round in it. It requires some practice. The gold keeps
    to the bottom of the dish, by its own weight. At last there is only a little
    half-moon of sand or fine gravel in the bottom lower edge of the dish&mdash; you
    work the dish slanting from you. Presently the gold, if there was any in
    the dirt, appears in &lsquo;colours&rsquo;, grains, or little nuggets along
    the base of the half-moon of sand. The more gold there is in the dirt, or
    the coarser the gold is, the sooner it appears. A practised digger can work
    off the last speck of gravel, without losing a &lsquo;colour&rsquo;, by just
    working the water round and off in the dish. Also a careful digger could
    throw a handful of gold in a tub of dirt, and, washing it off in dishfuls,
    recover practically every colour.</p>
  <p>The gold-washing &lsquo;cradle&rsquo; is a box, shaped something like a
    boot, and the size of a travelling trunk, with rockers on, like a baby&rsquo;s
    cradle, and a stick up behind for a handle; on top, where you&rsquo;ll put
    your foot into the boot, is a tray with a perforated iron bottom; the clay
    and gravel is thrown on the tray, water thrown on it, and the cradle rocked
    smartly. The finer gravel and the mullock goes through and down over a sloping
    board covered with blanket, and with ledges on it to catch the gold. The
    dish was mostly used for prospecting; large quantities of wash dirt was put
    through the horse-power  &lsquo;puddling-machine&rsquo;, which there isn&rsquo;t
    room to describe here.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Dave!&rsquo; said Pinter, after looking with mild surprise
    at the size of Dave&rsquo;s waste-heap. &lsquo;Tryin&rsquo; for the second
    bottom?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Dave, guttural.</p>
  <p>Pinter dropped his tools with a clatter at the foot of the waste-heap and
    scratched under his ear like an old cockatoo, which bird he resembled. Then
    he went to the windlass, and resting his hands on his knees, he peered down,
    while Dave stood by helpless and hopeless.</p>
  <p>Pinter straightened himself, blinking like an owl, and looked carelessly
    over the graveyard.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tryin&rsquo; for a secon&rsquo; bottom,&rsquo; he reflected absently. &lsquo;Eh,
    Dave?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dave only stood and looked black.</p>
  <p>Pinter tilted back his head and scratched the roots of his chin-feathers,
    which stuck out all round like a dirty, ragged fan held horizontally.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kullers is safe,&rsquo; reflected Pinter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right?&rsquo; snapped Dave. &lsquo;I suppose we must let him
    into it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Kullers&rsquo; was a big American buck nigger, and had been Pinter&rsquo;s
    mate for some time&mdash;Pinter was a man of odd mates; and what Pinter meant
    was that Kullers was safe to hold his tongue.</p>
  <p>Next morning Pinter and his coloured mate appeared on the ground early,
    Pinter with some tools and the nigger with a windlass-bole on his shoulders.
    Pinter chose a spot about three panels or thirty feet along the other fence,
    the back fence of the cemetery, and started his hole. He lost no time for
    the sake of appearances, he sunk his shaft and started to drive straight
    for the point under the cemetery for which Dave was making; he gave out that
    he had bottomed on good &lsquo;indications&rsquo; running in the other direction,
    and would work the ground outside the fence. Meanwhile Dave rigged a fan&mdash;partly
    for the sake of appearances, but mainly because his and Jim&rsquo;s lively
    imaginations made the air in the drive worse than it really was. A &lsquo;fan&rsquo; is
    a thing like a paddle-wheel rigged in a box, about the size of a cradle,
    and something the shape of a shoe, but rounded over the top. There is a small
    grooved wheel on the axle of the fan outside, and an endless line, like a
    clothes-line, is carried over this wheel and a groove in the edge of a high
    light wooden driving-wheel rigged between two uprights in the rear and with
    a handle to turn. That&rsquo;s how the thing is driven. A wind-chute, like
    an endless pillow-slip, made of calico, with the mouth tacked over the open
    toe of the fan-box, and the end taken down the shaft and along the drive&mdash; this
    carries the fresh air into the workings.</p>
  <p>Dave was working the ground on each side as he went, when one morning a
    thought struck him that should have struck him the day Pinter went to work.
    He felt mad that it hadn&rsquo;t struck him sooner.</p>
  <p>Pinter and Kullers had also shifted their tent down into a nice quiet place
    in the Bush close handy; so, early next Sunday morning, while Pinter and
    Kullers were asleep, Dave posted Jim Bently to watch their tent, and whistle
    an alarm if they stirred, and then dropped down into Pinter&rsquo;s hole
    and saw at a glance what he was up to.</p>
  <p>After that Dave lost no time: he drove straight on, encouraged by the thuds
    of Pinter&rsquo;s and Kullers&rsquo; picks drawing nearer. They would strike
    his tunnel at right angles. Both parties worked long hours, only knocking
    off to fry a bit of steak in the pan, boil the billy, and throw themselves
    dressed on their bunks to get a few hours&rsquo; sleep. Pinter had practical
    experience and a line clear of graves, and he made good time. The two parties
    now found it more comfortable to be not on speaking terms. Individually they
    grew furtive, and began to feel criminal like&mdash;at least Dave and Jim
    did. They&rsquo;d start if a horse stumbled through the Bush, and expected
    to see a mounted policeman ride up at any moment and hear him ask questions.
    They had driven about thirty-five feet when, one Saturday afternoon, the
    strain became too great, and Dave and Jim got drunk. The spree lasted over
    Sunday, and on Monday morning they felt too shaky to come to work and had
    more drink. On Monday afternoon, Kullers, whose shift it was below, stuck
    his pick through the face of his drive into the wall of Dave&rsquo;s, about
    four feet from the end of it: the clay flaked away, leaving a hole as big
    as a wash-hand basin. They knocked off for the day and decided to let the
    other party take the offensive.</p>
  <p>Tuesday morning Dave and Jim came to work, still feeling shaky. Jim went
    below, crawled along the drive, lit his candle, and stuck it in the spiked
    iron socket and the spike in the wall of the drive, quite close to the hole,
    without noticing either the hole or the increased freshness in the air. He
    started picking away at the &lsquo;face&rsquo; and scraping the clay back
    from under his feet, and didn&rsquo;t hear Kullers come to work. Kullers
    came in softly and decided to try a bit of cheerful bluff. He stuck his great
    round black face through the hole, the whites of his eyes rolling horribly
    in the candle-light, and said, with a deep guffaw&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ullo! you dar&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>No bandicoot ever went into his hole with the dogs after him quicker than
    Jim came out of his. He scrambled up the shaft by the foot-holes, and sat
    on the edge of the waste-heap, looking very pale.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; asked Dave. &lsquo;Have you seen
    a ghost?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the&mdash;the devil!&rsquo; gasped Jim. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    done with this here ghoul business.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The parties got on speaking terms again. Dave was very warm, but Jim&rsquo;s
    language was worse. Pinter scratched his chin-feathers reflectively till
    the other party cooled. There was no appealing to the Commissioner for goldfields;
    they were outside all law, whether of the goldfields or otherwise&mdash;so
    they did the only thing possible and sensible, they joined forces and became &lsquo;Poynton,
    Regan, &amp; Party&rsquo;. They agreed to work the ground from the separate
    shafts, and decided to go ahead, irrespective of appearances, and get as
    much dirt out and cradled as possible before the inevitable exposure came
    along. They found plenty of &lsquo;payable dirt&rsquo;, and soon the drive
    ended in a cluster of roomy chambers. They timbered up many coffins of various
    ages, burnt tarred canvas and brown paper, and kept the fan going. Outside
    they paid the storekeeper with difficulty and talked of hard times.</p>
  <p>But one fine sunny morning, after about a week of partnership, they got
    a bad scare. Jim and Kullers were below, getting out dirt for all they were
    worth, and Pinter and Dave at their windlasses, when who should march down
    from the cemetery gate but Mother Middleton herself. She was a hard woman
    to look at. She still wore the old-fashioned crinoline and her hair in a
    greasy net; and on this as on most other sober occasions, she wore the expression
    of a rough Irish navvy who has just enough drink to make him nasty and is
    looking out for an excuse for a row. She had a stride like a grenadier. A
    digger had once measured her step by her footprints in the mud where she
    had stepped across a gutter: it measured three feet from toe to heel.</p>
  <p>She marched to the grave of Jimmy Middleton, laid a dingy bunch of flowers
    thereon, with the gesture of an angry man banging his fist down on the table,
    turned on her heel, and marched out. The diggers were dirt beneath her feet.
    Presently they heard her drive on in her spring-cart on her way into town,
    and they drew breaths of relief.</p>
  <p>It was afternoon. Dave and Pinter were feeling tired, and were just deciding
    to knock off work for that day when they heard a scuffling in the direction
    of the different shafts, and both Jim and Kullers dropped down and bundled
    in in a great hurry. Jim chuckled in a silly way, as if there was something
    funny, and Kullers guffawed in sympathy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rsquo; demanded Dave apprehensively.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Mother Middleton,&rsquo; said Jim; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s blind mad drunk,
    and she&rsquo;s got a bottle in one hand and a new pitchfork in the other,
    that she&rsquo;s bringing out for some one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How the hell did she drop to it?&rsquo; exclaimed Pinter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dunno,&rsquo; said Jim. &lsquo;Anyway she&rsquo;s coming for us.
    Listen to her!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They didn&rsquo;t have to listen hard. The language which came down the
    shaft&mdash; they weren&rsquo;t sure which one&mdash;and along the drives
    was enough to scare up the dead and make them take to the Bush.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you fools make off into the Bush and give us a chance,
    instead of giving her a lead here?&rsquo; asked Dave.</p>
  <p>Jim and Kullers began to wish they had done so.</p>
  <p>Mrs Middleton began to throw stones down the shaft&mdash;it was Pinter&rsquo;s&mdash; and
    they, even the oldest and most anxious, began to grin in spite of themselves,
    for they knew she couldn&rsquo;t hurt them from the surface, and that, though
    she had been a working digger herself, she couldn&rsquo;t fill both shafts
    before the fumes of liquor overtook her.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wonder which shaf&rsquo; she&rsquo;ll come down,&rsquo; asked Kullers
    in a tone befitting the place and occasion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d better go and watch your shaft, Pinter,&rsquo; said Dave, &lsquo;and
    Jim and I&rsquo;ll watch mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Pinter hurriedly. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m
    a modest man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then they heard a clang in the direction of Pinter&rsquo;s shaft.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s thrown her bottle down,&rsquo; said Dave.</p>
  <p>Jim crawled along the drive a piece, urged by curiosity, and returned hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s broke the pitchfork off short, to use in the drive, and
    I believe she&rsquo;s coming down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Her crinoline&rsquo;ll handicap her,&rsquo; said Pinter vacantly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
    a comfort.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s took it off!&rsquo; said Dave excitedly; and peering
    along Pinter&rsquo;s drive, they saw first an elastic-sided boot, then a
    red-striped stocking, then a section of scarlet petticoat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lemme out!&rsquo; roared Pinter, lurching forward and making a swimming
    motion with his hands in the direction of Dave&rsquo;s drive. Kullers was
    already gone, and Jim well on the way. Dave, lanky and awkward, scrambled
    up the shaft last. Mrs Middleton made good time, considering she had the
    darkness to face and didn&rsquo;t know the workings, and when Dave reached
    the top he had a tear in the leg of his moleskins, and the blood ran from
    a nasty scratch. But he didn&rsquo;t wait to argue over the price of a new
    pair of trousers. He made off through the Bush in the direction of an encouraging
    whistle thrown back by Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s too drunk to get her story listened to to-night,&rsquo; said
    Dave. &lsquo;But to-morrow she&rsquo;ll bring the neighbourhood down on us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And she&rsquo;s enough, without the neighbourhood,&rsquo; reflected
    Pinter.</p>
  <p>Some time after dark they returned cautiously, reconnoitred their camp,
    and after hiding in a hollow log such things as they couldn&rsquo;t carry,
    they rolled up their tents like the Arabs, and silently stole away.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheChinamansGhost"></a>The Chinaman&rsquo;s
      Ghost</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;Simple&nbsp;as striking matches,&rsquo; said Dave Regan, Bushman; &lsquo;but
    it gave me the biggest scare I ever had&mdash;except, perhaps, the time I
    stumbled in the dark into a six-feet digger&rsquo;s hole, which might have
    been eighty feet deep for all I knew when I was falling. (There was an eighty-feet
    shaft left open close by.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was the night of the day after the Queen&rsquo;s birthday. I was
    sinking a shaft with Jim Bently and Andy Page on the old Redclay goldfield,
    and we camped in a tent on the creek. Jim and me went to some races that
    was held at Peter Anderson&rsquo;s pub., about four miles across the ridges,
    on Queen&rsquo;s birthday. Andy was a quiet sort of chap, a teetotaller,
    and we&rsquo;d disgusted him the last time he was out for a holiday with
    us, so he stayed at home and washed and mended his clothes, and read an arithmetic
    book. (He used to keep the accounts, and it took him most of his spare time.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jim and me had a pretty high time. We all got pretty tight after
    the races, and I wanted to fight Jim, or Jim wanted to fight me&mdash; I
    don&rsquo;t remember which. We were old chums, and we nearly always wanted
    to fight each other when we got a bit on, and we&rsquo;d fight if we weren&rsquo;t
    stopped. I remember once Jim got maudlin drunk and begged and prayed of me
    to fight him, as if he was praying for his life. Tom Tarrant, the coach-driver,
    used to say that Jim and me must be related, else we wouldn&rsquo;t hate
    each other so much when we were tight and truthful.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Anyway, this day, Jim got the sulks, and caught his horse and went
    home early in the evening. My dog went home with him too; I must have been
    carrying on pretty bad to disgust the dog.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Next evening I got disgusted with myself, and started to walk home.
    I&rsquo;d lost my hat, so Peter Anderson lent me an old one of his, that
    he&rsquo;d worn on Ballarat he said: it was a hard, straw, flat, broad-brimmed
    affair, and fitted my headache pretty tight. Peter gave me a small flask
    of whisky to help me home. I had to go across some flats and up a long dark
    gully called Murderer&rsquo;s Gully, and over a gap called Dead Man&rsquo;s
    Gap, and down the ridge and gullies to Redclay Creek. The lonely flats were
    covered with blue-grey gum bush, and looked ghostly enough in the moonlight,
    and I was pretty shaky, but I had a pull at the flask and a mouthful of water
    at a creek and felt right enough. I began to whistle, and then to sing: I
    never used to sing unless I thought I was a couple of miles out of earshot
    of any one.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Murderer&rsquo;s Gully was deep and pretty dark most times, and of
    course it was haunted. Women and children wouldn&rsquo;t go through it after
    dark; and even me, when I&rsquo;d grown up, I&rsquo;d hold my back pretty
    holler, and whistle, and walk quick going along there at night-time. We&rsquo;re
    all afraid of ghosts, but we won&rsquo;t let on.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Some one had skinned a dead calf during the day and left it on the
    track, and it gave me a jump, I promise you. It looked like two corpses laid
    out naked. I finished the whisky and started up over the gap. All of a sudden
    a great &lsquo;old man&rsquo; kangaroo went across the track with a thud-thud,
    and up the siding, and that startled me. Then the naked, white glistening
    trunk of a stringy-bark tree, where some one had stripped off a sheet of
    bark, started out from a bend in the track in a shaft of moonlight, and that
    gave me a jerk. I was pretty shaky before I started. There was a Chinaman&rsquo;s
    grave close by the track on the top of the gap. An old chow had lived in
    a hut there for many years, and fossicked on the old diggings, and one day
    he was found dead in the hut, and the Government gave some one a pound to
    bury him. When I was a nipper we reckoned that his ghost haunted the gap,
    and cursed in Chinese because the bones hadn&rsquo;t been sent home to China.
    It was a lonely, ghostly place enough.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It had been a smotheringly hot day and very close coming across the
    flats and up the gully&mdash;not a breath of air; but now as I got higher
    I saw signs of the thunderstorm we&rsquo;d expected all day, and felt the
    breath of a warm breeze on my face. When I got into the top of the gap the
    first thing I saw was something white amongst the dark bushes over the spot
    where the Chinaman&rsquo;s grave was, and I stood staring at it with both
    eyes. It moved out of the shadow presently, and I saw that it was a white
    bullock, and I felt relieved. I&rsquo;d hardly felt relieved when, all at
    once, there came a &ldquo;pat-pat-pat&rdquo;of running feet close behind
    me! I jumped round quick, but there was nothing there, and while I stood
    staring all ways for Sunday, there came a &ldquo;pat-pat&rdquo;, then a pause,
    and then &ldquo;pat-pat-pat-pat&rdquo; behind me again: it was like some
    one dodging and running off that time. I started to walk down the track pretty
    fast, but hadn&rsquo;t gone a dozen yards when &ldquo;pat-pat-pat&rdquo;,
    it was close behind me again. I jerked my eyes over my shoulder but kept
    my legs going. There was nothing behind, but I fancied I saw something slip
    into the Bush to the right. It must have been the moonlight on the moving
    boughs; there was a good breeze blowing now. I got down to a more level track,
    and was making across a spur to the main road, when  &ldquo;pat-pat!&rdquo; &ldquo;pat-pat-pat,
    pat-pat-pat!&rdquo; it was after me again. Then I began to run&mdash;and
    it began to run too! &ldquo;pat-pat-pat&rdquo; after me all the time. I hadn&rsquo;t
    time to look round. Over the spur and down the siding and across the flat
    to the road I went as fast as I could split my legs apart. I had a scared
    idea that I was getting a touch of the &ldquo;jim-jams&rdquo;, and that frightened
    me more than any outside ghost could have done. I stumbled a few times, and
    saved myself, but, just before I reached the road, I fell slithering on to
    my hands on the grass and gravel. I thought I&rsquo;d broken both my wrists.
    I stayed for a moment on my hands and knees, quaking and listening, squinting
    round like a great gohana; I couldn&rsquo;t hear nor see anything. I picked
    myself up, and had hardly got on one end, when &ldquo;pat-pat!&rdquo;it was
    after me again. I must have run a mile and a half altogether that night.
    It was still about three-quarters of a mile to the camp, and I ran till my
    heart beat in my head and my lungs choked up in my throat. I saw our tent-fire
    and took off my hat to run faster. The footsteps stopped, then something
    about the hat touched my fingers, and I stared at it&mdash; and the thing
    dawned on me. I hadn&rsquo;t noticed at Peter Anderson&rsquo;s&mdash; my
    head was too swimmy to notice anything. It was an old hat of the style that
    the first diggers used to wear, with a couple of loose ribbon ends, three
    or four inches long, from the band behind. As long as I walked quietly through
    the gully, and there was no wind, the tails didn&rsquo;t flap, but when I
    got up into the breeze, they flapped or were still according to how the wind
    lifted them or pressed them down flat on the brim. And when I ran they tapped
    all the time; and the hat being tight on my head, the tapping of the ribbon
    ends against the straw sounded loud of course.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I sat down on a log for a while to get some of my wind back and cool
    down, and then I went to the camp as quietly as I could, and had a long drink
    of water.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You seem to be a bit winded, Dave,&rdquo; said Jim Bently, &ldquo;and
    mighty thirsty. Did the Chinaman&rsquo;s ghost chase you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I told him not to talk rot, and went into the tent, and lay down
    on my bunk, and had a good rest.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLoadedDog"></a>The Loaded Dog</b></h2>
  <p>Dave Regan, Jim Bently, and Andy Page were sinking a shaft at Stony Creek
    in search of a rich gold quartz reef which was supposed to exist in the vicinity.
    There is always a rich reef supposed to exist in the vicinity; the only questions
    are whether it is ten feet or hundreds beneath the surface, and in which
    direction. They had struck some pretty solid rock, also water which kept
    them baling. They used the old-fashioned blasting-powder and time-fuse. They&rsquo;d
    make a sausage or cartridge of blasting-powder in a skin of strong calico
    or canvas, the mouth sewn and bound round the end of the fuse; they&rsquo;d
    dip the cartridge in melted tallow to make it water-tight, get the drill-hole
    as dry as possible, drop in the cartridge with some dry dust, and wad and
    ram with stiff clay and broken brick. Then they&rsquo;d light the fuse and
    get out of the hole and wait. The result was usually an ugly pot-hole in
    the bottom of the shaft and half a barrow-load of broken rock.</p>
  <p>There was plenty of fish in the creek, fresh-water bream, cod, cat-fish,
    and tailers. The party were fond of fish, and Andy and Dave of fishing. Andy
    would fish for three hours at a stretch if encouraged by a  &lsquo;nibble&rsquo; or
    a &lsquo;bite&rsquo; now and then&mdash;say once in twenty minutes. The butcher
    was always willing to give meat in exchange for fish when they caught more
    than they could eat; but now it was winter, and these fish wouldn&rsquo;t
    bite. However, the creek was low, just a chain of muddy water-holes, from
    the hole with a few bucketfuls in it to the sizable pool with an average
    depth of six or seven feet, and they could get fish by baling out the smaller
    holes or muddying up the water in the larger ones till the fish rose to the
    surface. There was the cat-fish, with spikes growing out of the sides of
    its head, and if you got pricked you&rsquo;d know it, as Dave said. Andy
    took off his boots, tucked up his trousers, and went into a hole one day
    to stir up the mud with his feet, and he knew it. Dave scooped one out with
    his hand and got pricked, and he knew it too; his arm swelled, and the pain
    throbbed up into his shoulder, and down into his stomach too, he said, like
    a toothache he had once, and kept him awake for two nights&mdash;only the
    toothache pain had a &lsquo;burred edge&rsquo;, Dave said.</p>
  <p>Dave got an idea.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not blow the fish up in the big water-hole with a cartridge?&rsquo;  he
    said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll try it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He thought the thing out and Andy Page worked it out. Andy usually put Dave&rsquo;s
    theories into practice if they were practicable, or bore the blame for the
    failure and the chaffing of his mates if they weren&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>He made a cartridge about three times the size of those they used in the
    rock. Jim Bently said it was big enough to blow the bottom out of the river.
    The inner skin was of stout calico; Andy stuck the end of a six-foot piece
    of fuse well down in the powder and bound the mouth of the bag firmly to
    it with whipcord. The idea was to sink the cartridge in the water with the
    open end of the fuse attached to a float on the surface, ready for lighting.
    Andy dipped the cartridge in melted bees&rsquo;-wax to make it water-tight. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
    have to leave it some time before we light it,&rsquo; said Dave, &lsquo;to
    give the fish time to get over their scare when we put it in, and come nosing
    round again; so we&rsquo;ll want it well water-tight.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Round the cartridge Andy, at Dave&rsquo;s suggestion, bound a strip of sail
    canvas&mdash;that they used for making water-bags&mdash;to increase the force
    of the explosion, and round that he pasted layers of stiff brown paper&mdash;on
    the plan of the sort of fireworks we called &lsquo;gun-crackers&rsquo;. He
    let the paper dry in the sun, then he sewed a covering of two thicknesses
    of canvas over it, and bound the thing from end to end with stout fishing-line.
    Dave&rsquo;s schemes were elaborate, and he often worked his inventions out
    to nothing. The cartridge was rigid and solid enough now&mdash;a formidable
    bomb; but Andy and Dave wanted to be sure. Andy sewed on another layer of
    canvas, dipped the cartridge in melted tallow, twisted a length of fencing-wire
    round it as an afterthought, dipped it in tallow again, and stood it carefully
    against a tent-peg, where he&rsquo;d know where to find it, and wound the
    fuse loosely round it. Then he went to the camp-fire to try some potatoes
    which were boiling in their jackets in a billy, and to see about frying some
    chops for dinner. Dave and Jim were at work in the claim that morning.</p>
  <p>They had a big black young retriever dog&mdash;or rather an overgrown pup,
    a big, foolish, four-footed mate, who was always slobbering round them and
    lashing their legs with his heavy tail that swung round like a stock-whip.
    Most of his head was usually a red, idiotic, slobbering grin of appreciation
    of his own silliness. He seemed to take life, the world, his two-legged mates,
    and his own instinct as a huge joke. He&rsquo;d retrieve anything: he carted
    back most of the camp rubbish that Andy threw away. They had a cat that died
    in hot weather, and Andy threw it a good distance away in the scrub; and
    early one morning the dog found the cat, after it had been dead a week or
    so, and carried it back to camp, and laid it just inside the tent-flaps,
    where it could best make its presence known when the mates should rise and
    begin to sniff suspiciously in the sickly smothering atmosphere of the summer
    sunrise. He used to retrieve them when they went in swimming; he&rsquo;d
    jump in after them, and take their hands in his mouth, and try to swim out
    with them, and scratch their naked bodies with his paws. They loved him for
    his good-heartedness and his foolishness, but when they wished to enjoy a
    swim they had to tie him up in camp.</p>
  <p>He watched Andy with great interest all the morning making the cartridge,
    and hindered him considerably, trying to help; but about noon he went off
    to the claim to see how Dave and Jim were getting on, and to come home to
    dinner with them. Andy saw them coming, and put a panful of mutton-chops
    on the fire. Andy was cook to-day; Dave and Jim stood with their backs to
    the fire, as Bushmen do in all weathers, waiting till dinner should be ready.
    The retriever went nosing round after something he seemed to have missed.</p>
  <p>Andy&rsquo;s brain still worked on the cartridge; his eye was caught by
    the glare of an empty kerosene-tin lying in the bushes, and it struck him
    that it wouldn&rsquo;t be a bad idea to sink the cartridge packed with clay,
    sand, or stones in the tin, to increase the force of the explosion. He may
    have been all out, from a scientific point of view, but the notion looked
    all right to him. Jim Bently, by the way, wasn&rsquo;t interested in their &lsquo;damned
    silliness&rsquo;. Andy noticed an empty treacle-tin&mdash;the sort with the
    little tin neck or spout soldered on to the top for the convenience of pouring
    out the treacle&mdash;and it struck him that this would have made the best
    kind of cartridge-case: he would only have had to pour in the powder, stick
    the fuse in through the neck, and cork and seal it with bees&rsquo;-wax.
    He was turning to suggest this to Dave, when Dave glanced over his shoulder
    to see how the chops were doing&mdash;and bolted. He explained afterwards
    that he thought he heard the pan spluttering extra, and looked to see if
    the chops were burning. Jim Bently looked behind and bolted after Dave. Andy
    stood stock-still, staring after them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Run, Andy! run!&rsquo; they shouted back at him. &lsquo;Run!!! Look
    behind you, you fool!&rsquo; Andy turned slowly and looked, and there, close
    behind him, was the retriever with the cartridge in his mouth&mdash;wedged
    into his broadest and silliest grin. And that wasn&rsquo;t all. The dog had
    come round the fire to Andy, and the loose end of the fuse had trailed and
    waggled over the burning sticks into the blaze; Andy had slit and nicked
    the firing end of the fuse well, and now it was hissing and spitting properly.</p>
  <p>Andy&rsquo;s legs started with a jolt; his legs started before his brain
    did, and he made after Dave and Jim. And the dog followed Andy.</p>
  <p>Dave and Jim were good runners&mdash;Jim the best&mdash;for a short distance;
    Andy was slow and heavy, but he had the strength and the wind and could last.
    The dog leapt and capered round him, delighted as a dog could be to find
    his mates, as he thought, on for a frolic. Dave and Jim kept shouting back, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    foller us! don&rsquo;t foller us, you coloured fool!&rsquo; but Andy kept
    on, no matter how they dodged. They could never explain, any more than the
    dog, why they followed each other, but so they ran, Dave keeping in Jim&rsquo;s
    track in all its turnings, Andy after Dave, and the dog circling round Andy&mdash;the
    live fuse swishing in all directions and hissing and spluttering and stinking.
    Jim yelling to Dave not to follow him, Dave shouting to Andy to go in another
    direction&mdash; to &lsquo;spread out&rsquo;, and Andy roaring at the dog
    to go home. Then Andy&rsquo;s brain began to work, stimulated by the crisis:
    he tried to get a running kick at the dog, but the dog dodged; he snatched
    up sticks and stones and threw them at the dog and ran on again. The retriever
    saw that he&rsquo;d made a mistake about Andy, and left him and bounded after
    Dave. Dave, who had the presence of mind to think that the fuse&rsquo;s time
    wasn&rsquo;t up yet, made a dive and a grab for the dog, caught him by the
    tail, and as he swung round snatched the cartridge out of his mouth and flung
    it as far as he could: the dog immediately bounded after it and retrieved
    it. Dave roared and cursed at the dog, who seeing that Dave was offended,
    left him and went after Jim, who was well ahead. Jim swung to a sapling and
    went up it like a native bear; it was a young sapling, and Jim couldn&rsquo;t
    safely get more than ten or twelve feet from the ground. The dog laid the
    cartridge, as carefully as if it was a kitten, at the foot of the sapling,
    and capered and leaped and whooped joyously round under Jim. The big pup
    reckoned that this was part of the lark&mdash;he was all right now&mdash;it
    was Jim who was out for a spree. The fuse sounded as if it were going a mile
    a minute. Jim tried to climb higher and the sapling bent and cracked. Jim
    fell on his feet and ran. The dog swooped on the cartridge and followed.
    It all took but a very few moments. Jim ran to a digger&rsquo;s hole, about
    ten feet deep, and dropped down into it&mdash;landing on soft mud&mdash;and
    was safe. The dog grinned sardonically down on him, over the edge, for a
    moment, as if he thought it would be a good lark to drop the cartridge down
    on Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go away, Tommy,&rsquo; said Jim feebly, &lsquo;go away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The dog bounded off after Dave, who was the only one in sight now; Andy
    had dropped behind a log, where he lay flat on his face, having suddenly
    remembered a picture of the Russo-Turkish war with a circle of Turks lying
    flat on their faces (as if they were ashamed) round a newly-arrived shell.</p>
  <p>There was a small hotel or shanty on the creek, on the main road, not far
    from the claim. Dave was desperate, the time flew much faster in his stimulated
    imagination than it did in reality, so he made for the shanty. There were
    several casual Bushmen on the verandah and in the bar; Dave rushed into the
    bar, banging the door to behind him. &lsquo;My dog!&rsquo; he gasped, in
    reply to the astonished stare of the publican, &lsquo;the blanky retriever&mdash; he&rsquo;s
    got a live cartridge in his mouth&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The retriever, finding the front door shut against him, had bounded round
    and in by the back way, and now stood smiling in the doorway leading from
    the passage, the cartridge still in his mouth and the fuse spluttering. They
    burst out of that bar. Tommy bounded first after one and then after another,
    for, being a young dog, he tried to make friends with everybody.</p>
  <p>The Bushmen ran round corners, and some shut themselves in the stable. There
    was a new weather-board and corrugated-iron kitchen and wash-house on piles
    in the back-yard, with some women washing clothes inside. Dave and the publican
    bundled in there and shut the door&mdash;the publican cursing Dave and calling
    him a crimson fool, in hurried tones, and wanting to know what the hell he
    came here for.</p>
  <p>The retriever went in under the kitchen, amongst the piles, but, luckily
    for those inside, there was a vicious yellow mongrel cattle-dog sulking and
    nursing his nastiness under there&mdash;a sneaking, fighting, thieving canine,
    whom neighbours had tried for years to shoot or poison. Tommy saw his danger&mdash;he&rsquo;d
    had experience from this dog&mdash;and started out and across the yard, still
    sticking to the cartridge. Half-way across the yard the yellow dog caught
    him and nipped him. Tommy dropped the cartridge, gave one terrified yell,
    and took to the Bush. The yellow dog followed him to the fence and then ran
    back to see what he had dropped. Nearly a dozen other dogs came from round
    all the corners and under the buildings&mdash;spidery, thievish, cold-blooded
    kangaroo-dogs, mongrel sheep-and cattle-dogs, vicious black and yellow dogs&mdash;that
    slip after you in the dark, nip your heels, and vanish without explaining&mdash;and
    yapping, yelping small fry. They kept at a respectable distance round the
    nasty yellow dog, for it was dangerous to go near him when he thought he
    had found something which might be good for a dog to eat. He sniffed at the
    cartridge twice, and was just taking a third cautious sniff when&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>It was very good blasting powder&mdash;a new brand that Dave had recently
    got up from Sydney; and the cartridge had been excellently well made. Andy
    was very patient and painstaking in all he did, and nearly as handy as the
    average sailor with needles, twine, canvas, and rope.</p>
  <p>Bushmen say that that kitchen jumped off its piles and on again. When the
    smoke and dust cleared away, the remains of the nasty yellow dog were lying
    against the paling fence of the yard looking as if he had been kicked into
    a fire by a horse and afterwards rolled in the dust under a barrow, and finally
    thrown against the fence from a distance. Several saddle-horses, which had
    been &lsquo;hanging-up&rsquo; round the verandah, were galloping wildly down
    the road in clouds of dust, with broken bridle-reins flying; and from a circle
    round the outskirts, from every point of the compass in the scrub, came the
    yelping of dogs. Two of them went home, to the place where they were born,
    thirty miles away, and reached it the same night and stayed there; it was
    not till towards evening that the rest came back cautiously to make inquiries.
    One was trying to walk on two legs, and most of &rsquo;em looked more or
    less singed; and a little, singed, stumpy-tailed dog, who had been in the
    habit of hopping the back half of him along on one leg, had reason to be
    glad that he&rsquo;d saved up the other leg all those years, for he needed
    it now. There was one old one-eyed cattle-dog round that shanty for years
    afterwards, who couldn&rsquo;t stand the smell of a gun being cleaned. He
    it was who had taken an interest, only second to that of the yellow dog,
    in the cartridge. Bushmen said that it was amusing to slip up on his blind
    side and stick a dirty ramrod under his nose: he wouldn&rsquo;t wait to bring
    his solitary eye to bear&mdash;he&rsquo;d take to the Bush and stay out all
    night.</p>
  <p>For half an hour or so after the explosion there were several Bushmen round
    behind the stable who crouched, doubled up, against the wall, or rolled gently
    on the dust, trying to laugh without shrieking. There were two white women
    in hysterics at the house, and a half-caste rushing aimlessly round with
    a dipper of cold water. The publican was holding his wife tight and begging
    her between her squawks, to &lsquo;hold up for my sake, Mary, or I&rsquo;ll
    lam the life out of ye.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dave decided to apologise later on, &lsquo;when things had settled a bit,&rsquo; and
    went back to camp. And the dog that had done it all, &lsquo;Tommy&rsquo;,
    the great, idiotic mongrel retriever, came slobbering round Dave and lashing
    his legs with his tail, and trotted home after him, smiling his broadest,
    longest, and reddest smile of amiability, and apparently satisfied for one
    afternoon with the fun he&rsquo;d had.</p>
  <p>Andy chained the dog up securely, and cooked some more chops, while Dave
    went to help Jim out of the hole.</p>
  <p>And most of this is why, for years afterwards, lanky, easy-going Bushmen,
    riding lazily past Dave&rsquo;s camp, would cry, in a lazy drawl and with
    just a hint of the nasal twang&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Ello, Da-a-ve! How&rsquo;s the fishin&rsquo; getting on, Da-a-ve?&rsquo;</p>

    Dave Regan&rsquo;s Yarn</b></h3>
  <p>&lsquo;When we got tired of digging about Mudgee-Budgee, and getting no
    gold,&rsquo; said Dave Regan, Bushman, &lsquo;me and my mate, Jim Bently,
    decided to take a turn at droving; so we went with Bob Baker, the drover,
    overland with a big mob of cattle, way up into Northern Queensland.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We couldn&rsquo;t get a job on the home track, and we spent most
    of our money, like a pair of fools, at a pub. at a town way up over the border,
    where they had a flash barmaid from Brisbane. We sold our pack-horses and
    pack-saddles, and rode out of that town with our swags on our riding-horses
    in front of us. We had another spree at another place, and by the time we
    got near New South Wales we were pretty well stumped.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Just the other side of Mulgatown, near the border, we came on a big
    mob of cattle in a paddock, and a party of drovers camped on the creek. They
    had brought the cattle down from the north and were going no farther with
    them; their boss had ridden on into Mulgatown to get the cheques to pay them
    off, and they were waiting for him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;And Poisonous Jimmy is waiting for us,&rdquo; said one of
    them.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poisonous Jimmy kept a shanty a piece along the road from their camp
    towards Mulgatown. He was called &ldquo;Poisonous Jimmy&rdquo; perhaps on
    account of his liquor, or perhaps because he had a job of poisoning dingoes
    on a station in the Bogan scrubs at one time. He was a sharp publican. He
    had a girl, and they said that whenever a shearing-shed cut-out on his side
    and he saw the shearers coming along the road, he&rsquo;d say to the girl, &ldquo;Run
    and get your best frock on, Mary! Here&rsquo;s the shearers comin&rsquo;.&rdquo; And
    if a chequeman wouldn&rsquo;t drink he&rsquo;d try to get him into his bar
    and shout for him till he was too drunk to keep his hands out of his pockets.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;But he won&rsquo;t get us,&rdquo; said another of the drovers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    going to ride straight into Mulgatown and send my money home by the post
    as soon as I get it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve always said that, Jack,&rdquo; said the first
    drover.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We yarned a while, and had some tea, and then me and Jim got on our
    horses and rode on. We were burned to bricks and ragged and dusty and parched
    up enough, and so were our horses. We only had a few shillings to carry us
    four or five hundred miles home, but it was mighty hot and dusty, and we
    felt that we must have a drink at the shanty. This was west of the sixpenny-line
    at that time&mdash; all drinks were a shilling along here.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Just before we reached the shanty I got an idea.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll plant our swags in the scrub,&rdquo; I said to
    Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So we unstrapped our swags and hid them in the mulga scrub by the
    side of the road; then we rode on to the shanty, got down, and hung our horses
    to the verandah posts.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Poisonous&rdquo; came out at once, with a smile on him that
    would have made anybody home-sick.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was a short nuggety man, and could use his hands, they said; he
    looked as if he&rsquo;d be a nasty, vicious, cool customer in a fight&mdash; he
    wasn&rsquo;t the sort of man you&rsquo;d care to try and swindle a second
    time. He had a monkey shave when he shaved, but now it was all frill and
    stubble&mdash; like a bush fence round a stubble-field. He had a broken nose,
    and a cunning, sharp, suspicious eye that squinted, and a cold stony eye
    that seemed fixed. If you didn&rsquo;t know him well you might talk to him
    for five minutes, looking at him in the cold stony eye, and then discover
    that it was the sharp cunning little eye that was watching you all the time.
    It was awful embarrassing. It must have made him awkward to deal with in
    a fight.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day, mates,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; we said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We went into the bar, and Poisonous got behind the counter.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What are you going to have?&rdquo; he asked, rubbing up his
    glasses with a rag.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We had two long-beers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; said Poisonous, seeing me put my hand
    in my pocket; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s my shout. I don&rsquo;t suppose your boss
    is back yet? I saw him go in to Mulgatown this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t back,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I wish he was.
    We&rsquo;re getting tired of waiting for him. We&rsquo;ll give him another
    hour, and then some of us will have to ride in to see whether he&rsquo;s
    got on the boose, and get hold of him if he has.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re waiting for your cheques?&rdquo; he
    said, turning to fix some bottles on the shelf.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we are;&rdquo; and I winked at
    Jim, and Jim winked back as solemn as an owl.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poisonous asked us all about the trip, and how long we&rsquo;d been
    on the track, and what sort of a boss we had, dropping the questions offhand
    now an&rsquo; then, as for the sake of conversation. We could see that he
    was trying to get at the size of our supposed cheques, so we answered accordingly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Have another drink,&rdquo; he said, and he filled the pewters
    up again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s up to me,&rdquo; and he set to work boring out
    the glasses with his rag, as if he was short-handed and the bar was crowded
    with customers, and screwing up his face into what I suppose he considered
    an innocent or unconscious expression. The girl began to sidle in and out
    with a smart frock and a see-you-after-dark smirk on.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Have you had dinner?&rdquo; she asked. We could have done
    with a good meal, but it was too risky&mdash;the drovers&rsquo; boss might
    come along while we were at dinner and get into conversation with Poisonous.
    So we said we&rsquo;d had dinner.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poisonous filled our pewters again in an offhand way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I wish the boss would come,&rdquo; said Jim with a yawn. &ldquo;I
    want to get into Mulgatown to-night, and I want to get some shirts and things
    before I go in. I ain&rsquo;t got a decent rag to me back. I don&rsquo;t
    suppose there&rsquo;s ten bob amongst the lot of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was a general store back on the creek, near the drovers&rsquo;  camp.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, go to the store and get what you want,&rdquo; said Poisonous,
    taking a sovereign from the till and tossing it on to the counter. &ldquo;You
    can fix it up with me when your boss comes. Bring your mates along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jim, taking up the sovereign carelessly
    and dropping it into his pocket.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, Jim,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;suppose we get back to camp
    and see how the chaps are getting on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Tell them to come down and get a drink,&rdquo; said Poisonous; &ldquo;or,
    wait, you can take some beer along to them if you like,&rdquo; and he gave
    us half a gallon of beer in a billy-can. He knew what the first drink meant
    with Bushmen back from a long dry trip.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We got on our horses, I holding the billy very carefully, and rode
    back to where our swags were.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I say,&rdquo; said Jim, when we&rsquo;d strapped the swags
    to the saddles,  &ldquo;suppose we take the beer back to those chaps: it&rsquo;s
    meant for them, and it&rsquo;s only a fair thing, anyway&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
    got as much as we can hold till we get into Mulgatown.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It might get them into a row,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;and they
    seem decent chaps. Let&rsquo;s hang the billy on a twig, and that old swagman
    that&rsquo;s coming along will think there&rsquo;s angels in the Bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oh! what&rsquo;s a row?&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;They can take
    care of themselves; they&rsquo;ll have the beer anyway and a lark with Poisonous
    when they take the can back and it comes to explanations. I&rsquo;ll ride
    back to them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So Jim rode back to the drovers&rsquo; camp with the beer, and when
    he came back to me he said that the drovers seemed surprised, but they drank
    good luck to him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We rode round through the mulga behind the shanty and came out on
    the road again on the Mulgatown side: we only stayed at Mulgatown to buy
    some tucker and tobacco, then we pushed on and camped for the night about
    seven miles on the safe side of the town.&rsquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="ToldbyOneoftheOtherDrovers"></a>II<br>
    Told by One of the Other Drovers</b></h3>
  <p><b>&lsquo;</b>Talkin&rsquo; o&rsquo; Poisonous Jimmy, I can tell you a yarn
    about him. We&rsquo;d brought a mob of cattle down for a squatter the other
    side of Mulgatown. We camped about seven miles the other side of the town,
    waitin&rsquo; for the station hands to come and take charge of the stock,
    while the boss rode on into town to draw our money. Some of us was goin&rsquo;  back,
    though in the end we all went into Mulgatown and had a boose up with the
    boss. But while we was waitin&rsquo; there come along two fellers that had
    been drovin&rsquo; up north. They yarned a while, an&rsquo; then went on
    to Poisonous Jimmy&rsquo;s place, an&rsquo; in about an hour one on &rsquo;em
    come ridin&rsquo; back with a can of beer that he said Poisonous had sent
    for us. We all knew Jimmy&rsquo;s little games&mdash; the beer was a bait
    to get us on the drunk at his place; but we drunk the beer, and reckoned
    to have a lark with him afterwards. When the boss come back, an&rsquo; the
    station hands to take the bullocks, we started into Mulgatown. We stopped
    outside Poisonous&rsquo;s place an&rsquo; handed the can to the girl that
    was grinnin&rsquo; on the verandah. Poisonous come out with a grin on him
    like a parson with a broken nose.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day, boys!&rdquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day, Poisonous,&rdquo; we says.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot,&rdquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s blanky hot,&rdquo; I says.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He seemed to expect us to get down. &ldquo;Where are you off to?&rdquo; he
    says.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Mulgatown,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;It will be cooler there,&rdquo; and
    we sung out,  &ldquo;So-long, Poisonous!&rdquo; and rode on.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He stood starin&rsquo; for a minute; then he started shoutin&rsquo;, &ldquo;Hi!
    hi there!&rdquo; after us, but we took no notice, an&rsquo; rode on. When
    we looked back last he was runnin&rsquo; into the scrub with a bridle in
    his hand.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We jogged along easily till we got within a mile of Mulgatown, when
    we heard somebody gallopin&rsquo; after us, an&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; back
    we saw it was Poisonous.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was too mad and too winded to speak at first, so he rode along
    with us a bit gasping: then he burst out.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s them other two carnal blanks?&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What other two?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all here.
    What&rsquo;s the matter with you anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;All here!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lurid liar!
    What the flamin&rsquo;  sheol do you mean by swiggin&rsquo; my beer an&rsquo; flingin&rsquo; the
    coloured can in me face? without as much as thank yer! D&rsquo;yer think
    I&rsquo;m a flamin&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, but Poisonous Jimmy was wild.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll pay for your dirty beer,&rdquo; says one
    of the chaps, puttin&rsquo; his hand in his pocket. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
    want yer slush. It tasted as if it had been used before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pay for it!&rdquo; yelled Jimmy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&mdash;well
    take it out of one of yer bleedin&rsquo; hides!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We stopped at once, and I got down an&rsquo; obliged Jimmy for a
    few rounds. He was a nasty customer to fight; he could use his hands, and
    was cool as a cucumber as soon as he took his coat off: besides, he had one
    squirmy little business eye, and a big wall-eye, an&rsquo;, even if you knowed
    him well, you couldn&rsquo;t help watchin&rsquo; the stony eye&mdash; it
    was no good watchin&rsquo; his eyes, you had to watch his hands, and he might
    have managed me if the boss hadn&rsquo;t stopped the fight. The boss was
    a big, quiet-voiced man, that didn&rsquo;t swear.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now, look here, Myles,&rdquo; said the boss (Jimmy&rsquo;s
    name was Myles)&mdash;  &ldquo;Now, look here, Myles,&rdquo; sez the boss, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
    all this about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&rdquo; says Jimmy, gettin&rsquo; excited
    agen. &ldquo;Why, two fellers that belonged to your party come along to my
    place an&rsquo; put up half-a-dozen drinks, an&rsquo; borrered a sovereign,
    an&rsquo; got a can o&rsquo; beer on the strength of their cheques. They
    sez they was waitin&rsquo; for you&mdash;an&rsquo; I want my crimson money
    out o&rsquo; some one!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What was they like?&rdquo; asks the boss.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Like?&rdquo; shouted Poisonous, swearin&rsquo; all the time. &ldquo;One
    was a blanky long, sandy, sawny feller, and the other was a short, slim feller
    with black hair. Your blanky men knows all about them because they had the
    blanky billy o&rsquo; beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Now, what&rsquo;s this all about, you chaps?&rdquo; sez the
    boss to us.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So we told him as much as we knowed about them two fellers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard men swear that could swear in a rough shearin&rsquo;-shed,
    but I never heard a man swear like Poisonous Jimmy when he saw how he&rsquo;d
    been left. It was enough to split stumps. He said he wanted to see those
    fellers, just once, before he died.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He rode with us into Mulgatown, got mad drunk, an&rsquo; started
    out along the road with a tomahawk after the long sandy feller and the slim
    dark feller; but two mounted police went after him an&rsquo; fetched him
    back. He said he only wanted justice; he said he only wanted to stun them
    two fellers till he could give &rsquo;em in charge.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They fined him ten bob.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostlyDoor"></a>The Ghostly Door</b></h2>
  <p align="center"><i>Told by one of Dave&rsquo;s mates</i></p>
  <p>Dave&nbsp;and I were tramping on a lonely Bush track in New Zealand, making
    for a sawmill where we expected to get work, and we were caught in one of
    those three-days&rsquo; gales, with rain and hail in it and cold enough to
    cut off a man&rsquo;s legs. Camping out was not to be thought of, so we just
    tramped on in silence, with the stinging pain coming between our shoulder-blades&mdash;from
    cold, weariness, and the weight of our swags&mdash; and our boots, full of
    water, going splosh, splosh, splosh along the track. We were settled to it&mdash;to
    drag on like wet, weary, muddy working bullocks till we came to somewhere&mdash;when,
    just before darkness settled down, we saw the loom of a humpy of some sort
    on the slope of a tussock hill, back from the road, and we made for it, without
    holding a consultation.</p>
  <p>It was a two-roomed hut built of waste timber from a sawmill, and was either
    a deserted settler&rsquo;s home or a hut attached to an abandoned sawmill
    round there somewhere. The windows were boarded up. We dumped our swags under
    the little verandah and banged at the door, to make sure; then Dave pulled
    a couple of boards off a window and looked in: there was light enough to
    see that the place was empty. Dave pulled off some more boards, put his arm
    in through a broken pane, clicked the catch back, and then pushed up the
    window and got in. I handed in the swags to him. The room was very draughty;
    the wind came in through the broken window and the cracks between the slabs,
    so we tried the partitioned-off room&mdash;the bedroom&mdash;and that was
    better. It had been lined with chaff-bags, and there were two stretchers
    left by some timber-getters or other Bush contractors who&rsquo;d camped
    there last; and there were a box and a couple of three-legged stools.</p>
  <p>We carried the remnant of the wood-heap inside, made a fire, and put the
    billy on. We unrolled our swags and spread the blankets on the stretchers;
    and then we stripped and hung our clothes about the fire to dry. There was
    plenty in our tucker-bags, so we had a good feed. I hadn&rsquo;t shaved for
    days, and Dave had a coarse red beard with a twist in it like an ill-used
    fibre brush&mdash;a beard that got redder the longer it grew; he had a hooked
    nose, and his hair stood straight up (I never saw a man so easy-going about
    the expression and so scared about the head), and he was very tall, with
    long, thin, hairy legs. We must have looked a weird pair as we sat there,
    naked, on the low three-legged stools, with the billy and the tucker on the
    box between us, and ate our bread and meat with clasp-knives.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rsquo; says Dave, &lsquo;but this is the &ldquo;whare&rdquo; (Maori
    name for house) where the murder was that we heard about along the road.
    I suppose if any one was to come along now and look in he&rsquo;d get scared.&rsquo; Then
    after a while he looked down at the flooring-boards close to my feet, and
    scratched his ear, and said, &lsquo;That looks very much like a blood-stain
    under your stool, doesn&rsquo;t it, Jim?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I shifted my feet and presently moved the stool farther away from the fire&mdash; it
    was too hot.</p>
  <p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have liked to camp there by myself, but I don&rsquo;t think
    Dave would have minded&mdash;he&rsquo;d knocked round too much in the Australian
    Bush to mind anything much, or to be surprised at anything; besides, he was
    more than half murdered once by a man who said afterwards that he&rsquo;d
    mistook him for some one else: he must have been a very short-sighted murderer.</p>
  <p>Presently we put tobacco, matches, and bits of candle we had, on the two
    stools by the heads of our bunks, turned in, and filled up and smoked comfortably,
    dropping in a lazy word now and again about nothing in particular. Once I
    happened to look across at Dave, and saw him sitting up a bit and watching
    the door. The door opened very slowly, wide, and a black cat walked in, looked
    first at me, then at Dave, and walked out again; and the door closed behind
    it.</p>
  <p>Dave scratched his ear. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s rum,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I
    could have sworn I fastened that door. They must have left the cat behind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It looks like it,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Neither of us has been on
    the boose lately.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He got out of bed and up on his long hairy spindle-shanks.</p>
  <p>The door had the ordinary, common black oblong lock with a brass knob. Dave
    tried the latch and found it fast; he turned the knob, opened the door, and
    called, &lsquo;Puss&mdash;puss&mdash;puss!&rsquo; but the cat wouldn&rsquo;t
    come. He shut the door, tried the knob to see that the catch had caught,
    and got into bed again.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d scarcely settled down when the door opened slowly, the black
    cat walked in, stared hard at Dave, and suddenly turned and darted out as
    the door closed smartly.</p>
  <p>I looked at Dave and he looked at me&mdash;hard; then he scratched the back
    of his head. I never saw a man look so puzzled in the face and scared about
    the head.</p>
  <p>He got out of bed very cautiously, took a stick of firewood in his hand,
    sneaked up to the door, and snatched it open. There was no one there. Dave
    took the candle and went into the next room, but couldn&rsquo;t see the cat.
    He came back and sat down by the fire and meowed, and presently the cat answered
    him and came in from somewhere&mdash;she&rsquo;d been outside the window,
    I suppose; he kept on meowing and she sidled up and rubbed against his hairy
    shin. Dave could generally bring a cat that way. He had a weakness for cats.
    I&rsquo;d seen him kick a dog, and hammer a horse&mdash;brutally, I thought&mdash;but
    I never saw him hurt a cat or let any one else do it. Dave was good to cats:
    if a cat had a family where Dave was round, he&rsquo;d see her all right
    and comfortable, and only drown a fair surplus. He said once to me, &lsquo;I
    can understand a man kicking a dog, or hammering a horse when it plays up,
    but I can&rsquo;t understand a man hurting a cat.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He gave this cat something to eat. Then he went and held the light close
    to the lock of the door, but could see nothing wrong with it. He found a
    key on the mantel-shelf and locked the door. He got into bed again, and the
    cat jumped up and curled down at the foot and started her old drum going,
    like shot in a sieve. Dave bent down and patted her, to tell her he&rsquo;d
    meant no harm when he stretched out his legs, and then he settled down again.</p>
  <p>We had some books of the &lsquo;Deadwood Dick&rsquo; school. Dave was reading&nbsp;<i>The
      Grisly Ghost of the Haunted Gulch</i>, and I had&nbsp;<i>The Dismembered
      Hand</i>, or&nbsp;<i>The Disembowelled Corpse</i>, or some such names.
      They were first-class preparation for a ghost.</p>
  <p>I was reading away, and getting drowsy, when I noticed a movement and saw
    Dave&rsquo;s frightened head rising, with the terrified shadow of it on the
    wall. He was staring at the door, over his book, with both eyes. And that
    door was opening again&mdash;slowly&mdash;and Dave had locked it! I never
    felt anything so creepy: the foot of my bunk was behind the door, and I drew
    up my feet as it came open; it opened wide, and stood so. We waited, for
    five minutes it seemed, hearing each other breathe, watching for the door
    to close; then Dave got out, very gingerly, and up on one end, and went to
    the door like a cat on wet bricks.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You shot the bolt&nbsp;<i>outside</i>&nbsp;the catch,&rsquo; I said,
    as he caught hold of the door &mdash;like one grabs a craw-fish.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I didn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Dave. But he&rsquo;d
    already turned the key a couple of times, so he couldn&rsquo;t be sure. He
    shut and locked the door again.  &lsquo;Now, get out and see for yourself,&rsquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>I got out, and tried the door a couple of times and found it all right.
    Then we both tried, and agreed that it was locked.</p>
  <p>I got back into bed, and Dave was about half in when a thought struck him.
    He got the heaviest piece of firewood and stood it against the door.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing that for?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;If there&rsquo;s a broken-down burglar camped round here, and trying
    any of his funny business, we&rsquo;ll hear him if he tries to come in while
    we&rsquo;re asleep,&rsquo; says Dave. Then he got back into bed. We composed
    our nerves with the&nbsp;<i>Haunted Gulch</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Disembowelled
    Corpse</i>, and after a while I heard Dave snore, and was just dropping off
    when the stick fell from the door against my big toe and then to the ground
    with tremendous clatter. I snatched up my feet and sat up with a jerk, and
    so did Dave&mdash;the cat went over the partition. That door opened, only
    a little way this time, paused, and shut suddenly. Dave got out, grabbed
    a stick, skipped to the door, and clutched at the knob as if it were a nettle,
    and the door wouldn&rsquo;t come!&mdash;it was fast and locked! Then Dave&rsquo;s
    face began to look as frightened as his hair. He lit his candle at the fire,
    and asked me to come with him; he unlocked the door and we went into the
    other room, Dave shading his candle very carefully and feeling his way slow
    with his feet. The room was empty; we tried the outer door and found it locked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It muster gone by the winder,&rsquo; whispered Dave. I noticed that
    he said &lsquo;it&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;he&rsquo;. I saw that he himself
    was shook up, and it only needed that to scare me bad.</p>
  <p>We went back to the bedroom, had a drink of cold tea, and lit our pipes.
    Then Dave took the waterproof cover off his bunk, spread it on the floor,
    laid his blankets on top of it, his spare clothes, &amp;c., on top of them,
    and started to roll up his swag.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you going to do, Dave?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to take the track,&rsquo; says Dave, &lsquo;and camp
    somewhere farther on. You can stay here, if you like, and come on in the
    morning.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I started to roll up my swag at once. We dressed and fastened on the tucker-bags,
    took up the billies, and got outside without making any noise. We held our
    backs pretty hollow till we got down on to the road.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That comes of camping in a deserted house,&rsquo; said Dave, when
    we were safe on the track. No Australian Bushman cares to camp in an abandoned
    homestead, or even near it&mdash;probably because a deserted home looks ghostlier
    in the Australian Bush than anywhere else in the world.</p>
  <p>It was blowing hard, but not raining so much.</p>
  <p>We went on along the track for a couple of miles and camped on the sheltered
    side of a round tussock hill, in a hole where there had been a landslip.
    We used all our candle-ends to get a fire alight, but once we got it started
    we knocked the wet bark off&nbsp;<i>manuka</i>&nbsp;sticks and logs and piled
    them on, and soon had a roaring fire. When the ground got a little drier
    we rigged a bit of shelter from the showers with some sticks and the oil-cloth
    swag-covers; then we made some coffee and got through the night pretty comfortably.
    In the morning Dave said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going back to that house.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What for?&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out what&rsquo;s the matter with that crimson
    door. If I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll never be able to sleep easy within a mile
    of a door so long as I live.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>So we went back. It was still blowing. The thing was simple enough by daylight&mdash;after
    a little watching and experimenting. The house was built of odds and ends
    and badly fitted. It &lsquo;gave&rsquo; in the wind in almost any direction&mdash;not
    much, not more than an inch or so, but just enough to throw the door-frame
    out of plumb and out of square in such a way as to bring the latch and bolt
    of the lock clear of the catch (the door-frame was of scraps joined). Then
    the door swung open according to the hang of it; and when the gust was over
    the house gave back, and the door swung to&mdash;the frame easing just a
    little in another direction. I suppose it would take Edison to invent a thing
    like that, that came about by accident. The different strengths and directions
    of the gusts of wind must have accounted for the variations of the door&rsquo;s
    movements&mdash; and maybe the draught of our big fire had helped.</p>
  <p>Dave scratched his head a good bit.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never lived in a house yet,&rsquo; he said, as we came away&mdash; &lsquo;I
    never lived in a house yet without there was something wrong with it. Gimme
    a good tent.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AWildIrishman"></a>A Wild Irishman</b></h2>
  <p>About&nbsp;seven years ago I drifted from Out-Back in Australia to Wellington,
    the capital of New Zealand, and up country to a little town called Pahiatua,
    which meaneth the &lsquo;home of the gods&rsquo;, and is situated in the
    Wairarappa (rippling or sparkling water) district. They have a pretty little
    legend to the effect that the name of the district was not originally suggested
    by its rivers, streams, and lakes, but by the tears alleged to have been
    noticed, by a dusky squire, in the eyes of a warrior chief who was looking
    his first, or last&mdash; I don&rsquo;t remember which&mdash;upon the scene.
    He was the discoverer, I suppose, now I come to think of it, else the place
    would have been already named. Maybe the scene reminded the old cannibal
    of the home of his childhood.</p>
  <p>Pahiatua was not the home of my god; and it rained for five weeks. While
    waiting for a remittance, from an Australian newspaper&mdash; which, I anxiously
    hoped, would arrive in time for enough of it to be left (after paying board)
    to take me away somewhere&mdash;I spent many hours in the little shop of
    a shoemaker who had been a digger; and he told me yarns of the old days on
    the West Coast of Middle Island. And, ever and anon, he returned to one,
    a hard-case from the West Coast, called &lsquo;The Flour of Wheat&rsquo;,
    and his cousin, and his mate, Dinny Murphy, dead. And ever and again the
    shoemaker (he was large, humorous, and good-natured) made me promise that,
    when I dropped across an old West Coast digger&mdash; no matter who or what
    he was, or whether he was drunk or sober&mdash; I&rsquo;d ask him if he knew
    the &lsquo;Flour of Wheat&rsquo;, and hear what he had to say.</p>
  <p>I make no attempt to give any one shade of the Irish brogue&mdash; it can&rsquo;t
    be done in writing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s the little red Irishman,&rsquo; said the shoemaker,
    who was Irish himself, &lsquo;who always wants to fight when he has a glass
    in him; and there&rsquo;s the big sarcastic dark Irishman who makes more
    trouble and fights at a spree than half-a-dozen little red ones put together;
    and there&rsquo;s the cheerful easy-going Irishman. Now the Flour was a combination
    of all three and several other sorts. He was known from the first amongst
    the boys at Th&rsquo; Canary as the Flour o&rsquo; Wheat, but no one knew
    exactly why. Some said that the right name was the F-l-o-w-e-r, not F-l-o-u-r,
    and that he was called that because there was no flower on wheat. The name
    might have been a compliment paid to the man&rsquo;s character by some one
    who understood and appreciated it&mdash;or appreciated it without understanding
    it. Or it might have come of some chance saying of the Flour himself, or
    his mates&mdash;or an accident with bags of flour. He might have worked in
    a mill. But we&rsquo;ve had enough of that. It&rsquo;s the man &mdash;not
    the name. He was just a big, dark, blue-eyed Irish digger. He worked hard,
    drank hard, fought hard&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t swear. No man had ever heard
    him swear (except once); all things were &lsquo;lovely&rsquo; with him. He
    was always lucky. He got gold and threw it away.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Flour was sent out to Australia (by his friends) in connection
    with some trouble in Ireland in eighteen-something. The date doesn&rsquo;t
    matter: there was mostly trouble in Ireland in those days; and nobody, that
    knew the man, could have the slightest doubt that he helped the trouble  &mdash;provided
    he was there at the time. I heard all this from a man who knew him in Australia.
    The relatives that he was sent out to were soon very anxious to see the end
    of him. He was as wild as they made them in Ireland. When he had a few drinks,
    he&rsquo;d walk restlessly to and fro outside the shanty, swinging his right
    arm across in front of him with elbow bent and hand closed, as if he had
    a head in chancery, and muttering, as though in explanation to himself&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Oi must be walkin&rsquo; or foightin&rsquo;!&mdash;Oi must
    be walkin&rsquo; or foightin&rsquo;!&mdash; Oi must be walkin&rsquo; or foightin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They say that he wanted to eat his Australian relatives before he
    was done; and the story goes that one night, while he was on the spree, they
    put their belongings into a cart and took to the Bush.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s no floury record for several years; then the Flour
    turned up on the west coast of New Zealand and was never very far from a
    pub, kept by a cousin (that he had tracked, unearthed, or discovered somehow)
    at a place called &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Canary&rdquo;. I remember the first time
    I saw the Flour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was on a bit of a spree myself, at Th&rsquo; Canary, and one evening
    I was standing outside Brady&rsquo;s (the Flour&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s place)
    with Tom Lyons and Dinny Murphy, when I saw a big man coming across the flat
    with a swag on his back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;B&rsquo; God, there&rsquo;s the Flour o&rsquo; Wheat comin&rsquo; this
    minute,&rdquo; says Dinny Murphy to Tom, &ldquo;an&rsquo; no one else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;B&rsquo; God, ye&rsquo;re right!&rdquo; says Tom.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There were a lot of new chums in the big room at the back, drinking
    and dancing and singing, and Tom says to Dinny&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Dinny, I&rsquo;ll bet you a quid an&rsquo; the Flour&rsquo;ll
    run against some of those new chums before he&rsquo;s an hour on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But Dinny wouldn&rsquo;t take him up. He knew the Flour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day, Tom! Good day, Dinny!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good day to you, Flour!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was introduced.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, boys, come along,&rdquo; says the Flour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And so we went inside with him. The Flour had a few drinks, and then
    he went into the back-room where the new chums were. One of them was dancing
    a jig, and so the Flour stood up in front of him and commenced to dance too.
    And presently the new chum made a step that didn&rsquo;t please the Flour,
    so he hit him between the eyes, and knocked him down&mdash;fair an&rsquo; flat
    on his back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Take that,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Take that, me lovely whipper-snapper,
    an&rsquo;  lay there! You can&rsquo;t dance. How dare ye stand up in front
    of me face to dance when ye can&rsquo;t dance?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He shouted, and drank, and gambled, and danced, and sang, and fought
    the new chums all night, and in the morning he said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, boys, we had a grand time last night. Come and have
    a drink with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And of course they went in and had a drink with him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Next morning the Flour was walking along the street, when he met
    a drunken, disreputable old hag, known among the boys as the &ldquo;Nipper&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good&nbsp;<i>morning</i>, me lovely Flour o&rsquo; Wheat!&rdquo; says
    she.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Good&nbsp;<i>morning</i>, me lovely Nipper!&rdquo; says the
    Flour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And with that she outs with a bottle she had in her dress, and smashed
    him across the face with it. Broke the bottle to smithereens!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A policeman saw her do it, and took her up; and they had the Flour
    as a witness, whether he liked it or not. And a lovely sight he looked, with
    his face all done up in bloody bandages, and only one damaged eye and a corner
    of his mouth on duty.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing at all, your Honour,&rdquo; he said to
    the S.M.; &ldquo;only a pin-scratch&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing at all. Let
    it pass. I had no right to speak to the lovely woman at all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But they didn&rsquo;t let it pass,&mdash;they fined her a quid.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the Flour paid the fine.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But, alas for human nature! It was pretty much the same even in those
    days, and amongst those men, as it is now. A man couldn&rsquo;t do a woman
    a good turn without the dirty-minded blackguards taking it for granted there
    was something between them. It was a great joke amongst the boys who knew
    the Flour, and who also knew the Nipper; but as it was carried too far in
    some quarters, it got to be no joke to the Flour&mdash;nor to those who laughed
    too loud or grinned too long.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Flour&rsquo;s cousin thought he was a sharp man. The Flour got  &ldquo;stiff&rdquo;.
    He hadn&rsquo;t any money, and his credit had run out, so he went and got
    a blank summons from one of the police he knew. He pretended that he wanted
    to frighten a man who owed him some money. Then he filled it up and took
    it to his cousin.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think of that?&rdquo; he says, handing the
    summons across the bar. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye think of me lovely Dinny Murphy
    now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Why, what&rsquo;s this all about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know. I borrowed a five-pound-note
    off of him a fortnight ago when I was drunk, an&rsquo; now he sends me that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, I never would have dream&rsquo;d that of Dinny,&rdquo; says
    the cousin, scratching his head and blinking. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s come over
    him at all?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;What have you been doing to the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Divil a thing that I&rsquo;m aware of.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The cousin rubbed his chin-tuft between his forefinger and thumb.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well, what am I to do about it?&rdquo; asked the Flour impatiently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do? Pay the man, of course?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;How can I pay the lovely man when I haven&rsquo;t got the
    price of a drink about me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The cousin scratched his chin.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well&mdash;here, I&rsquo;ll lend you a five-pound-note for
    a month or two. Go and pay the man, and get back to work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the Flour went and found Dinny Murphy, and the pair of them had
    a howling spree together up at Brady&rsquo;s, the opposition pub. And the
    cousin said he thought all the time he was being had.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was nasty sometimes, when he was about half drunk. For instance,
    he&rsquo;d come on the ground when the Orewell sports were in full swing
    and walk round, soliloquising just loud enough for you to hear; and just
    when a big event was coming off he&rsquo;d pass within earshot of some committee
    men&mdash;who had been bursting themselves for weeks to work the thing up
    and make it a success&mdash;saying to himself&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the Orewell sports that I hear so much about?
    I don&rsquo;t see them! Can any one direct me to the Orewell sports?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Or he&rsquo;d pass a raffle, lottery, lucky-bag, or golden-barrel
    business of some sort,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;No gamblin&rsquo; for the Flour. I don&rsquo;t believe in
    their little shwindles. It ought to be shtopped. Leadin&rsquo; young people
    ashtray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Or he&rsquo;d pass an Englishman he didn&rsquo;t like,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Look at Jinneral Roberts! He&rsquo;s a man! He&rsquo;s an
    Irishman! England has to come to Ireland for its Jinnerals! Luk at Jinneral
    Roberts in the marshes of Candyhar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They always had sports at Orewell Creek on New Year&rsquo;s Day&mdash;except
    once&mdash; and old Duncan was always there,&mdash;never missed it till the
    day he died. He was a digger, a humorous and good-hearted &ldquo;hard-case&rdquo;.
    They all knew &ldquo;old Duncan&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But one New Year&rsquo;s Eve he didn&rsquo;t turn up, and was missed
    at once.  &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s old Duncan? Any one seen old Duncan?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    he&rsquo;ll turn up alright.&rdquo;  They inquired, and argued, and waited,
    but Duncan didn&rsquo;t come.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Duncan was working at Duffers. The boys inquired of fellows who came
    from Duffers, but they hadn&rsquo;t seen him for two days. They had fully
    expected to find him at the creek. He wasn&rsquo;t at Aliaura nor Notown.
    They inquired of men who came from Nelson Creek, but Duncan wasn&rsquo;t
    there.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something happened to the lovely man,&rdquo; said
    the Flour of Wheat at last. &ldquo;Some of us had better see about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Pretty soon this was the general opinion, and so a party started
    out over the hills to Duffers before daylight in the morning, headed by the
    Flour.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &lsquo;The door of Duncan&rsquo;s &ldquo;whare&rdquo; was closed&mdash;<i>but
      not padlocked</i>. The Flour noticed this, gave his head a jerk, opened
      the door, and went in. The hut was tidied up and swept out&mdash;even the
      fireplace. Duncan had  &ldquo;lifted the boxes&rdquo; and &ldquo;cleaned
      up&rdquo;, and his little bag of gold stood on a shelf by his side&mdash;all
      ready for his spree. On the table lay a clean neckerchief folded ready
      to tie on. The blankets had been folded neatly and laid on the bunk, and
      on them was stretched Old Duncan, with his arms lying crossed on his chest,
      and one foot&mdash;with a boot on&mdash;resting on the ground. He had his &ldquo;clean
      things&rdquo; on, and was dressed except for one boot, the necktie, and
      his hat. Heart disease.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Take your hats off and come in quietly, lads,&rdquo; said
    the Flour.  &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the lovely man lying dead in his bunk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There were no sports at Orewell that New Year. Some one said that
    the crowd from Nelson Creek might object to the sports being postponed on
    old Duncan&rsquo;s account, but the Flour said he&rsquo;d see to that.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;One or two did object, but the Flour reasoned with them and there
    were no sports.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the Flour used to say, afterwards, &ldquo;Ah, but it was a grand
    time we had at the funeral when Duncan died at Duffers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Flour of Wheat carried his mate, Dinny Murphy, all the way in
    from Th&rsquo; Canary to the hospital on his back. Dinny was very bad&mdash; the
    man was dying of the dysentery or something. The Flour laid him down on a
    spare bunk in the reception-room, and hailed the staff.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Inside there&mdash;come out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The doctor and some of the hospital people came to see what was the
    matter. The doctor was a heavy swell, with a big cigar, held up in front
    of him between two fat, soft, yellow-white fingers, and a dandy little pair
    of gold-rimmed eye-glasses nipped onto his nose with a spring.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s me lovely mate lying there dying of the dysentry,&rdquo; says
    the Flour, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve got to fix him up and bring him round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he shook his fist in the doctor&rsquo;s face and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you let that lovely man die&mdash;look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The doctor was startled. He backed off at first; then he took a puff
    at his cigar, stepped forward, had a careless look at Dinny, and gave some
    order to the attendants. The Flour went to the door, turned half round as
    he went out, and shook his fist at them again, and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you let that lovely man die&mdash;mind!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;In about twenty minutes he came back, wheeling a case of whisky in
    a barrow. He carried the case inside, and dumped it down on the floor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;pour that into the lovely man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he shook his fist at such members of the staff as were visible,
    and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;If you let that lovely man die&mdash;look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They were used to hard-cases, and didn&rsquo;t take much notice of
    him, but he had the hospital in an awful mess; he was there all hours of
    the day and night; he would go down town, have a few drinks and a fight maybe,
    and then he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Ah, well, I&rsquo;ll have to go up and see
    how me lovely mate&rsquo;s getting on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And every time he&rsquo;d go up he&rsquo;d shake his fist at the
    hospital in general and threaten to murder &rsquo;em all if they let Dinny
    Murphy die.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Dinny Murphy died one night. The next morning the Flour met
    the doctor in the street, and hauled off and hit him between the eyes, and
    knocked him down before he had time to see who it was.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Stay there, ye little whipper-snapper,&rdquo; said the Flour
    of Wheat;  &ldquo;you let that lovely man die!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The police happened to be out of town that day, and while they were
    waiting for them the Flour got a coffin and carried it up to the hospital,
    and stood it on end by the doorway.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come for me lovely mate!&rdquo; he said to the
    scared staff&mdash; or as much of it as he baled up and couldn&rsquo;t escape
    him. &ldquo;Hand him over. He&rsquo;s going back to be buried with his friends
    at Th&rsquo; Canary. Now, don&rsquo;t be sneaking round and sidling off,
    you there; you needn&rsquo;t be frightened; I&rsquo;ve settled with the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But they called in a man who had some influence with the Flour, and
    between them&mdash;and with the assistance of the prettiest nurse on the
    premises&mdash;they persuaded him to wait. Dinny wasn&rsquo;t ready yet;
    there were papers to sign; it wouldn&rsquo;t be decent to the dead; he had
    to be prayed over; he had to be washed and shaved, and fixed up decent and
    comfortable. Anyway, they&rsquo;d have him ready in an hour, or take the
    consequences.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Flour objected on the ground that all this could be done equally
    as well and better by the boys at Th&rsquo; Canary. &ldquo;However,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be round in an hour, and if you haven&rsquo;t got
    me lovely mate ready&mdash; look out!&rdquo;  Then he shook his fist sternly
    at them once more and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I know yer dirty tricks and dodges, and if there&rsquo;s e&rsquo;er
    a pin-scratch on me mate&rsquo;s body&mdash;look out! If there&rsquo;s a
    pairin&rsquo; of Dinny&rsquo;s toe-nail missin&rsquo;&mdash;look out!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he went out&mdash;taking the coffin with him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And when the police came to his lodgings to arrest him, they found
    the coffin on the floor by the side of the bed, and the Flour lying in it
    on his back, with his arms folded peacefully on his bosom. He was as dead
    drunk as any man could get to be and still be alive. They knocked air-holes
    in the coffin-lid, screwed it on, and carried the coffin, the Flour, and
    all to the local lock-up. They laid their burden down on the bare, cold floor
    of the prison-cell, and then went out, locked the door, and departed several
    ways to put the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; up to it. And about midnight the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; gathered
    round with a supply of liquor, and waited, and somewhere along in the small
    hours there was a howl, as of a strong Irishman in Purgatory, and presently
    the voice of the Flour was heard to plead in changed and awful tones&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Pray for me soul, boys&mdash;pray for me soul! Let bygones
    be bygones between us, boys, and pray for me lovely soul! The lovely Flour&rsquo;s
    in Purgatory!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then silence for a while; and then a sound like a dray-wheel passing
    over a packing-case. . . . That was the only time on record that the Flour
    was heard to swear. And he swore then.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They didn&rsquo;t pray for him&mdash;they gave him a month. And,
    when he came out, he went half-way across the road to meet the doctor, and
    he&mdash; to his credit, perhaps&mdash;came the other half. They had a drink
    together, and the Flour presented the doctor with a fine specimen of coarse
    gold for a pin.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;It was the will o&rsquo; God, after all, doctor,&rdquo; said
    the Flour. &ldquo;It was the will o&rsquo; God. Let bygones be bygones between
    us; gimme your hand, doctor. . . . Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Then he left for Th&rsquo; Canary.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBabiesintheBush"></a>The Babies in the Bush</b></h2>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Oh, tell her a tale of the fairies bright&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That only the Bushmen know&mdash;<br>
    Who guide the feet of the lost aright,<br>
    Or carry them up through the starry night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Bush-lost babies go.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He&nbsp;was one of those men who seldom smile. There are many in the Australian
    Bush, where drift wrecks and failures of all stations and professions (and
    of none), and from all the world. Or, if they do smile, the smile is either
    mechanical or bitter as a rule&mdash;cynical. They seldom talk. The sort
    of men who, as bosses, are set down by the majority&mdash;and without reason
    or evidence&mdash; as being proud, hard, and selfish,&mdash;&lsquo;too mean
    to live, and too big for their boots.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But when the Boss did smile his expression was very, very gentle, and very
    sad. I have seen him smile down on a little child who persisted in sitting
    on his knee and prattling to him, in spite of his silence and gloom. He was
    tall and gaunt, with haggard grey eyes&mdash;haunted grey eyes sometimes&mdash; and
    hair and beard thick and strong, but grey. He was not above forty-five. He
    was of the type of men who die in harness, with their hair thick and strong,
    but grey or white when it should be brown. The opposite type, I fancy, would
    be the soft, dark-haired, blue-eyed men who grow bald sooner than they grow
    grey, and fat and contented, and die respectably in their beds.</p>
  <p>His name was Head&mdash;Walter Head. He was a boss drover on the overland
    routes. I engaged with him at a place north of the Queensland border to travel
    down to Bathurst, on the Great Western Line in New South Wales, with something
    over a thousand head of store bullocks for the Sydney market. I am an Australian
    Bushman (with city experience)&mdash;a rover, of course, and a ne&rsquo;er-do-well,
    I suppose. I was born with brains and a thin skin&mdash; worse luck! It was
    in the days before I was married, and I went by the name of &lsquo;Jack Ellis&rsquo;  this
    trip,&mdash;not because the police were after me, but because I used to tell
    yarns about a man named Jack Ellis&mdash; and so the chaps nicknamed me.</p>
  <p>The Boss spoke little to the men: he&rsquo;d sit at tucker or with his pipe
    by the camp-fire nearly as silently as he rode his night-watch round the
    big, restless, weird-looking mob of bullocks camped on the dusky starlit
    plain. I believe that from the first he spoke oftener and more confidentially
    to me than to any other of the droving party. There was a something of sympathy
    between us&mdash;I can&rsquo;t explain what it was. It seemed as though it
    were an understood thing between us that we understood each other. He sometimes
    said things to me which would have needed a deal of explanation&mdash;so
    I thought&mdash; had he said them to any other of the party. He&rsquo;d often,
    after brooding a long while, start a sentence, and break off with &lsquo;You
    know, Jack.&rsquo; And somehow I understood, without being able to explain
    why. We had never met before I engaged with him for this trip. His men respected
    him, but he was not a popular boss: he was too gloomy, and never drank a
    glass nor &lsquo;shouted&rsquo; on the trip: he was reckoned a &lsquo;mean
    boss&rsquo;, and rather a nigger-driver.</p>
  <p>He was full of Adam Lindsay Gordon, the English-Australian poet who shot
    himself, and so was I. I lost an old copy of Gordon&rsquo;s poems on the
    route, and the Boss overheard me inquiring about it; later on he asked me
    if I liked Gordon. We got to it rather sheepishly at first, but by-and-by
    we&rsquo;d quote Gordon freely in turn when we were alone in camp. &lsquo;Those
    are grand lines about Burke and Wills, the explorers, aren&rsquo;t they,
    Jack?&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say, after chewing his cud, or rather the stem of
    his briar, for a long while without a word. (He had his pipe in his mouth
    as often as any of us, but somehow I fancied he didn&rsquo;t enjoy it: an
    empty pipe or a stick would have suited him just as well, it seemed to me.) &lsquo;Those
    are great lines,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d say&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;&ldquo;In Collins Street standeth a statue tall&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statue tall on a pillar of stone&mdash;<br>
    Telling its story to great and small<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dust reclaimed from the sand-waste lone. </p>
  <p align="center"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p class="note">Weary and wasted, worn and wan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeble and faint, and languid and low,<br>
    He lay on the desert a dying man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has gone, my friends, where we all must go.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>That&rsquo;s a grand thing, Jack. How does it go?&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;With a pistol clenched in his failing hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the film of death o&rsquo;er his fading eyes,<br>
    He saw the sun go down on the sand,&rdquo;&rsquo;&mdash; </p>
  <p>The Boss would straighten up with a sigh that might have been half a yawn&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note"><i>&lsquo;</i>&ldquo;And he slept and never saw it rise,&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
  <p>&mdash;speaking with a sort of quiet force all the time. Then maybe he&rsquo;d
    stand with his back to the fire roasting his dusty leggings, with his hands
    behind his back and looking out over the dusky plain.</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;&ldquo;What mattered the sand or the whit&rsquo;ning
    chalk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blighted herbage or blackened log,<br>
    The crooked beak of the eagle-hawk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the hot red tongue of the native dog?&rdquo; </p>
  <p>They don&rsquo;t matter much, do they, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Damned if I think they do, Boss!&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say.</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;&ldquo;The couch was rugged, those sextons rude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, in spite of a leaden shroud, we know<br>
    That the bravest and fairest are earth-worms&rsquo; food<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once they have gone where we all must go.&rdquo;&rsquo; </p>
  <p>Once he repeated the poem containing the lines&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;Love, when we wandered
    here together,<br>
    Hand in hand through the sparkling weather&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God surely loved us a little then.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Beautiful lines those, Jack.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Then skies were fairer and shores were firmer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the blue sea over the white sand rolled&mdash;<br>
    Babble and prattle, and prattle and murmur&rsquo;&mdash; </p>
  <p>How does it go, Jack?&rsquo; He stood up and turned his face to the light,
    but not before I had a glimpse of it. I think that the saddest eyes on earth
    are mostly women&rsquo;s eyes, but I&rsquo;ve seen few so sad as the Boss&rsquo;s
    were just then.</p>
  <p>It seemed strange that he, a Bushman, preferred Gordon&rsquo;s sea poems
    to his horsey and bushy rhymes; but so he did. I fancy his favourite poem
    was that one of Gordon&rsquo;s with the lines&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;I would that with sleepy soft embraces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sea would fold me, would find me rest<br>
    In the luminous depths of its secret places,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the wealth of God&rsquo;s marvels is manifest!&rsquo; </p>
  <p>He usually spoke quietly, in a tone as though death were in camp; but after
    we&rsquo;d been on Gordon&rsquo;s poetry for a while he&rsquo;d end it abruptly
    with,  &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s time to turn in,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
    time to turn out,&rsquo; or he&rsquo;d give me an order in connection with
    the cattle. He had been a well-to-do squatter on the Lachlan river-side,
    in New South Wales, and had been ruined by the drought, they said. One night
    in camp, and after smoking in silence for nearly an hour, he asked&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do you know Fisher, Jack&mdash;the man that owns these bullocks?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve heard of him,&rsquo; I said. Fisher was a big squatter,
    with stations both in New South Wales and in Queensland.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, he came to my station on the Lachlan years ago without a penny
    in his pocket, or decent rag to his back, or a crust in his tucker-bag, and
    I gave him a job. He&rsquo;s my boss now. Ah, well! it&rsquo;s the way of
    Australia, you know, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Boss had one man who went on every droving trip with him; he was &lsquo;bred&rsquo; on
    the Boss&rsquo;s station, they said, and had been with him practically all
    his life. His name was &lsquo;Andy&rsquo;. I forget his other name, if he
    really had one. Andy had charge of the &lsquo;droving-plant&rsquo; (a tilted
    two-horse waggonette, in which we carried the rations and horse-feed), and
    he did the cooking and kept accounts. The Boss had no head for figures. Andy
    might have been twenty-five or thirty-five, or anything in between. His hair
    stuck up like a well-made brush all round, and his big grey eyes also had
    an inquiring expression. His weakness was girls, or he theirs, I don&rsquo;t
    know which (half-castes not barred). He was, I think, the most innocent,
    good-natured, and open-hearted scamp I ever met. Towards the middle of the
    trip Andy spoke to me one night alone in camp about the Boss.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Boss seems to have taken to you, Jack, all right.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Think so?&rsquo; I said. I thought I smelt jealousy and detected
    a sneer.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure of it. It&rsquo;s very seldom&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;takes
    to any one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I said nothing.</p>
  <p>Then after a while Andy said suddenly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Jack, I&rsquo;m glad of it. I&rsquo;d like to see him
    make a chum of some one, if only for one trip. And don&rsquo;t you make any
    mistake about the Boss. He&rsquo;s a white man. There&rsquo;s precious few
    that know him&mdash;precious few now; but I do, and it&rsquo;ll do him a
    lot of good to have some one to yarn with.&rsquo; And Andy said no more on
    the subject for that trip.</p>
  <p>The long, hot, dusty miles dragged by across the blazing plains&mdash;big
    clearings rather&mdash;and through the sweltering hot scrubs, and we reached
    Bathurst at last; and then the hot dusty days and weeks and months that we&rsquo;d
    left behind us to the Great North-West seemed as nothing,&mdash;as I suppose
    life will seem when we come to the end of it.</p>
  <p>The bullocks were going by rail from Bathurst to Sydney. We were all one
    long afternoon getting them into the trucks, and when we&rsquo;d finished
    the boss said to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Jack, you&rsquo;re going on to Sydney, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; I&rsquo;m going down to have a fly round.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, why not wait and go down with Andy in the morning? He&rsquo;s
    going down in charge of the cattle. The cattle-train starts about daylight.
    It won&rsquo;t be so comfortable as the passenger; but you&rsquo;ll save
    your fare, and you can give Andy a hand with the cattle. You&rsquo;ve only
    got to have a look at &rsquo;em every other station, and poke up any that
    fall down in the trucks. You and Andy are mates, aren&rsquo;t you?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I said it would just suit me. Somehow I fancied that the Boss seemed anxious
    to have my company for one more evening, and, to tell the truth, I felt really
    sorry to part with him. I&rsquo;d had to work as hard as any of the other
    chaps; but I liked him, and I believed he liked me. He&rsquo;d struck me
    as a man who&rsquo;d been quietened down by some heavy trouble, and I felt
    sorry for him without knowing what the trouble was.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and have a drink, Boss,&rsquo; I said. The agent had paid us
    off during the day.</p>
  <p>He turned into a hotel with me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t drink, Jack,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll
    take a glass with you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were a teetotaller, Boss,&rsquo; I said.
    I had not been surprised at his keeping so strictly from the drink on the
    trip; but now that it was over it was a different thing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a teetotaller, Jack,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I can take
    a glass or leave it.&rsquo; And he called for a long beer, and we drank &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s
    luck!&rsquo; to each other.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I wish I could take a glass or leave
    it.&rsquo; And I meant it.</p>
  <p>Then the Boss spoke as I&rsquo;d never heard him speak before. I thought
    for the moment that the one drink had affected him; but I understood before
    the night was over. He laid his hand on my shoulder with a grip like a man
    who has suddenly made up his mind to lend you five pounds. &lsquo;Jack!&rsquo; he
    said, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s worse things than drinking, and there&rsquo;s
    worse things than heavy smoking. When a man who smokes gets such a load of
    trouble on him that he can find no comfort in his pipe, then it&rsquo;s a
    heavy load. And when a man who drinks gets so deep into trouble that he can
    find no comfort in liquor, then it&rsquo;s deep trouble. Take my tip for
    it, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He broke off, and half turned away with a jerk of his head, as if impatient
    with himself; then presently he spoke in his usual quiet tone&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;re only a boy yet, Jack. Never mind me. I won&rsquo;t
    ask you to take the second drink. You don&rsquo;t want it; and, besides,
    I know the signs.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, leaning with both hands on the edge of the counter, and looking
    down between his arms at the floor. He stood that way thinking for a while;
    then he suddenly straightened up, like a man who&rsquo;d made up his mind
    to something.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want you to come along home with me, Jack,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll
    fix you a shake-down.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I forgot to tell you that he was married and lived in Bathurst.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But won&rsquo;t it put Mrs Head about?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not at all. She&rsquo;s expecting you. Come along; there&rsquo;s
    nothing to see in Bathurst, and you&rsquo;ll have plenty of knocking round
    in Sydney. Come on, we&rsquo;ll just be in time for tea.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He lived in a brick cottage on the outskirts of the town&mdash;an old-fashioned
    cottage, with ivy and climbing roses, like you see in some of those old settled
    districts. There was, I remember, the stump of a tree in front, covered with
    ivy till it looked like a giant&rsquo;s club with the thick end up.</p>
  <p>When we got to the house the Boss paused a minute with his hand on the gate.
    He&rsquo;d been home a couple of days, having ridden in ahead of the bullocks.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jack,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I must tell you that Mrs Head had a
    great trouble at one time. We&mdash;we lost our two children. It does her
    good to talk to a stranger now and again&mdash;she&rsquo;s always better
    afterwards; but there&rsquo;s very few I care to bring. You&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t
    notice anything strange. And agree with her, Jack. You know, Jack.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Boss,&rsquo; I said. I&rsquo;d knocked about
    the Bush too long, and run against too many strange characters and things,
    to be surprised at anything much.</p>
  <p>The door opened, and he took a little woman in his arms. I saw by the light
    of a lamp in the room behind that the woman&rsquo;s hair was grey, and I
    reckoned that he had his mother living with him. And&mdash;we do have odd
    thoughts at odd times in a flash&mdash;and I wondered how Mrs Head and her
    mother-in-law got on together. But the next minute I was in the room, and
    introduced to &lsquo;My wife, Mrs Head,&rsquo; and staring at her with both
    eyes.</p>
  <p>It was his wife. I don&rsquo;t think I can describe her. For the first minute
    or two, coming in out of the dark and before my eyes got used to the lamp-light,
    I had an impression as of a little old woman&mdash;one of those fresh-faced,
    well-preserved, little old ladies&mdash; who dressed young, wore false teeth,
    and aped the giddy girl. But this was because of Mrs Head&rsquo;s impulsive
    welcome of me, and her grey hair. The hair was not so grey as I thought at
    first, seeing it with the lamp-light behind it: it was like dull-brown hair
    lightly dusted with flour. She wore it short, and it became her that way.
    There was something aristocratic about her face&mdash;her nose and chin&mdash;I
    fancied, and something that you couldn&rsquo;t describe. She had big dark
    eyes&mdash;dark-brown, I thought, though they might have been hazel: they
    were a bit too big and bright for me, and now and again, when she got excited,
    the white showed all round the pupils&mdash;just a little, but a little was
    enough.</p>
  <p>She seemed extra glad to see me. I thought at first that she was a bit of
    a gusher.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she said,
    giving my hand a grip. &lsquo;Walter&mdash;Mr Head&mdash;has been speaking
    to me about you. I&rsquo;ve been expecting you. Sit down by the fire, Mr
    Ellis; tea will be ready presently. Don&rsquo;t you find it a bit chilly?&rsquo; She
    shivered. It was a bit chilly now at night on the Bathurst plains. The table
    was set for tea, and set rather in swell style. The cottage was too well
    furnished even for a lucky boss drover&rsquo;s home; the furniture looked
    as if it had belonged to a tony homestead at one time. I felt a bit strange
    at first, sitting down to tea, and almost wished that I was having a comfortable
    tuck-in at a restaurant or in a pub. dining-room. But she knew a lot about
    the Bush, and chatted away, and asked questions about the trip, and soon
    put me at my ease. You see, for the last year or two I&rsquo;d taken my tucker
    in my hands,&mdash;hunk of damper and meat and a clasp-knife mostly,&mdash;sitting
    on my heel in the dust, or on a log or a tucker-box.</p>
  <p>There was a hard, brown, wrinkled old woman that the Heads called  &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo;.
    She waited at the table; but Mrs Head kept bustling round herself most of
    the time, helping us. Andy came in to tea.</p>
  <p>Mrs Head bustled round like a girl of twenty instead of a woman of thirty-seven,
    as Andy afterwards told me she was. She had the figure and movements of a
    girl, and the impulsiveness and expression too&mdash;a womanly girl; but
    sometimes I fancied there was something very childish about her face and
    talk. After tea she and the Boss sat on one side of the fire and Andy and
    I on the other&mdash; Andy a little behind me at the corner of the table.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Walter&mdash;Mr Head&mdash;tells me you&rsquo;ve been out on the
    Lachlan river, Mr Ellis?&rsquo;  she said as soon as she&rsquo;d settled
    down, and she leaned forward, as if eager to hear that I&rsquo;d been there.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Mrs Head. I&rsquo;ve knocked round all about out there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She sat up straight, and put the tips of her fingers to the side of her
    forehead and knitted her brows. This was a trick she had&mdash;she often
    did it during the evening. And when she did that she seemed to forget what
    she&rsquo;d said last.</p>
  <p>She smoothed her forehead, and clasped her hands in her lap.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad to meet somebody from the back country, Mr
    Ellis,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Walter so seldom brings a stranger here, and
    I get tired of talking to the same people about the same things, and seeing
    the same faces. You don&rsquo;t know what a relief it is, Mr Ellis, to see
    a new face and talk to a stranger.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can quite understand that, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said. And so I could.
    I never stayed more than three months in one place if I could help it.</p>
  <p>She looked into the fire and seemed to try to think. The Boss straightened
    up and stroked her head with his big sun-browned hand, and then put his arm
    round her shoulders. This brought her back.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You know we had a station out on the Lachlan, Mr Ellis. Did Walter
    ever tell you about the time we lived there?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; I said, glancing at the Boss. &lsquo;I know you had a
    station there; but, you know, the Boss doesn&rsquo;t talk much.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell Jack, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled. &lsquo;You know Walter, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You
    won&rsquo;t mind him. He doesn&rsquo;t like me to talk about the children;
    he thinks it upsets me, but that&rsquo;s foolish: it always relieves me to
    talk to a stranger.&rsquo; She leaned forward, eagerly it seemed, and went
    on quickly: &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been wanting to tell you about the children
    ever since Walter spoke to me about you. I knew you would understand directly
    I saw your face. These town people don&rsquo;t understand. I like to talk
    to a Bushman. You know we lost our children out on the station. The fairies
    took them. Did Walter ever tell you about the fairies taking the children
    away?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>This was a facer. &lsquo;I&mdash;I beg pardon,&rsquo; I commenced, when
    Andy gave me a dig in the back. Then I saw it all.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Mrs Head. The Boss didn&rsquo;t tell me about that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You surely know about the Bush Fairies, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she said,
    her big eyes fixed on my face&mdash;&lsquo;the Bush Fairies that look after
    the little ones that are lost in the Bush, and take them away from the Bush
    if they are not found? You&rsquo;ve surely heard of them, Mr Ellis? Most
    Bushmen have that I&rsquo;ve spoken to. Maybe you&rsquo;ve seen them? Andy
    there has?&rsquo; Andy gave me another dig.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I&rsquo;ve heard of them, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;but
    I can&rsquo;t swear that I&rsquo;ve seen one.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Andy has. Haven&rsquo;t you, Andy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I have, Mrs Head. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you all about it
    the last time we were home?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And didn&rsquo;t you ever tell Mr Ellis, Andy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course he did!&rsquo; I said, coming to Andy&rsquo;s rescue; &lsquo;I
    remember it now. You told me that night we camped on the Bogan river, Andy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course!&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did he tell you about finding a lost child and the fairy with it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy; &lsquo;I told him all about that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the fairy was just going to take the child away when Andy found
    it, and when the fairy saw Andy she flew away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what Andy told me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And what did you say the fairy was like, Andy?&rsquo; asked Mrs Head,
    fixing her eyes on his face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Like. It was like one of them angels you see in Bible pictures, Mrs
    Head,&rsquo; said Andy promptly, sitting bolt upright, and keeping his big
    innocent grey eyes fixed on hers lest she might think he was telling lies. &lsquo;It
    was just like the angel in that Christ-in-the-stable picture we had at home
    on the station&mdash;the right-hand one in blue.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled. You couldn&rsquo;t call it an idiotic smile, nor the foolish
    smile you see sometimes in melancholy mad people. It was more of a happy
    childish smile.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was so foolish at first, and gave poor Walter and the doctors a
    lot of trouble,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Of course it never struck me, until
    afterwards, that the fairies had taken the children.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She pressed the tips of the fingers of both hands to her forehead, and sat
    so for a while; then she roused herself again&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But what am I thinking about? I haven&rsquo;t started to tell you
    about the children at all yet. Auntie! bring the children&rsquo;s portraits,
    will you, please? You&rsquo;ll find them on my dressing-table.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman seemed to hesitate.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Go on, Auntie, and do what I ask you,&rsquo; said Mrs Head. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
    be foolish. You know I&rsquo;m all right now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take any notice of Auntie, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she
    said with a smile, while the old woman&rsquo;s back was turned. &lsquo;Poor
    old body, she&rsquo;s a bit crotchety at times, as old women are. She doesn&rsquo;t
    like me to get talking about the children. She&rsquo;s got an idea that if
    I do I&rsquo;ll start talking nonsense, as I used to do the first year after
    the children were lost. I was very foolish then, wasn&rsquo;t I, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss. &lsquo;But that&rsquo;s all
    past. You mustn&rsquo;t think of that time any more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Mrs Head, in explanation to me, &lsquo;at first
    nothing would drive it out of my head that the children had wandered about
    until they perished of hunger and thirst in the Bush. As if the Bush Fairies
    would let them do that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were very foolish, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss; &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t
    think about that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman brought the portraits, a little boy and a little girl: they
    must have been very pretty children.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Mrs Head, taking the portraits eagerly, and
    giving them to me one by one, &lsquo;we had these taken in Sydney some years
    before the children were lost; they were much younger then. Wally&rsquo;s
    is not a good portrait; he was teething then, and very thin. That&rsquo;s
    him standing on the chair. Isn&rsquo;t the pose good? See, he&rsquo;s got
    one hand and one little foot forward, and an eager look in his eyes. The
    portrait is very dark, and you&rsquo;ve got to look close to see the foot.
    He wants a toy rabbit that the photographer is tossing up to make him laugh.
    In the next portrait he&rsquo;s sitting on the chair&mdash;he&rsquo;s just
    settled himself to enjoy the fun. But see how happy little Maggie looks!
    You can see my arm where I was holding her in the chair. She was six months
    old then, and little Wally had just turned two.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She put the portraits up on the mantel-shelf.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Let me see; Wally (that&rsquo;s little Walter, you know)&mdash;Wally
    was five and little Maggie three and a half when we lost them. Weren&rsquo;t
    they, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were away, Walter, when it happened.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss&mdash;cheerfully, it seemed to
    me&mdash;&lsquo;I was away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And we couldn&rsquo;t find you, Walter. You see,&rsquo; she said
    to me,  &lsquo;Walter&mdash;Mr Head&mdash;was away in Sydney on business,
    and we couldn&rsquo;t find his address. It was a beautiful morning, though
    rather warm, and just after the break-up of the drought. The grass was knee-high
    all over the run. It was a lonely place; there wasn&rsquo;t much bush cleared
    round the homestead, just a hundred yards or so, and the great awful scrubs
    ran back from the edges of the clearing all round for miles and miles&mdash;fifty
    or a hundred miles in some directions without a break; didn&rsquo;t they,
    Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was alone at the house except for Mary, a half-caste girl we had,
    who used to help me with the housework and the children. Andy was out on
    the run with the men, mustering sheep; weren&rsquo;t you, Andy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Mrs Head.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I used to watch the children close as they got to run about, because
    if they once got into the edge of the scrub they&rsquo;d be lost; but this
    morning little Wally begged hard to be let take his little sister down under
    a clump of blue-gums in a corner of the home paddock to gather buttercups.
    You remember that clump of gums, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I remember, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go through the fence a step, mumma,&rdquo; little
    Wally said. I could see Old Peter&mdash;an old shepherd and station-hand
    we had&mdash;I could see him working on a dam we were making across a creek
    that ran down there. You remember Old Peter, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course I do, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I knew that Old Peter would keep an eye to the children; so I told
    little Wally to keep tight hold of his sister&rsquo;s hand and go straight
    down to Old Peter and tell him I sent them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was leaning forward with her hands clasping her knee, and telling me
    all this with a strange sort of eagerness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The little ones toddled off hand in hand, with their other hands
    holding fast their straw hats. &ldquo;In case a bad wind blowed,&rdquo; as
    little Maggie said. I saw them stoop under the first fence, and that was
    the last that any one saw of them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Except the fairies, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss quickly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course, Walter, except the fairies.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She pressed her fingers to her temples again for a minute.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It seems that Old Peter was going to ride out to the musterers&rsquo;  camp
    that morning with bread for the men, and he left his work at the dam and
    started into the Bush after his horse just as I turned back into the house,
    and before the children got near him. They either followed him for some distance
    or wandered into the Bush after flowers or butterflies&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; She
    broke off, and then suddenly asked me, &lsquo;Do you think the Bush Fairies
    would entice children away, Mr Ellis?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Boss caught my eye, and frowned and shook his head slightly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No. I&rsquo;m sure they wouldn&rsquo;t, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;at
    least not from what I know of them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She thought, or tried to think, again for a while, in her helpless puzzled
    way. Then she went on, speaking rapidly, and rather mechanically, it seemed
    to me&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The first I knew of it was when Peter came to the house about an
    hour afterwards, leading his horse, and without the children. I said&mdash;I
    said, &ldquo;O my God! where&rsquo;s the children?&rdquo;&rsquo; Her fingers
    fluttered up to her temples.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind about that, Maggie,&rsquo; said the Boss, hurriedly,
    stroking her head. &lsquo;Tell Jack about the fairies.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You were away at the time, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And we couldn&rsquo;t find you, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Maggie,&rsquo; very gently. He rested his elbow on his knee and
    his chin on his hand, and looked into the fire.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault, Walter; but if you had been at home do
    you think the fairies would have taken the children?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course they would, Maggie. They had to: the children were lost.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And they&rsquo;re bringing the children home next year?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie&mdash;next year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She lifted her hands to her head in a startled way, and it was some time
    before she went on again. There was no need to tell me about the lost children.
    I could see it all. She and the half-caste rushing towards where the children
    were seen last, with Old Peter after them. The hurried search in the nearer
    scrub. The mother calling all the time for Maggie and Wally, and growing
    wilder as the minutes flew past. Old Peter&rsquo;s ride to the musterers&rsquo; camp.
    Horsemen seeming to turn up in no time and from nowhere, as they do in a
    case like this, and no matter how lonely the district. Bushmen galloping
    through the scrub in all directions. The hurried search the first day, and
    the mother mad with anxiety as night came on. Her long, hopeless, wild-eyed
    watch through the night; starting up at every sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoof,
    and reading the worst in one glance at the rider&rsquo;s face. The systematic
    work of the search-parties next day and the days following. How those days
    do fly past. The women from the next run or selection, and some from the
    town, driving from ten or twenty miles, perhaps, to stay with and try to
    comfort the mother. (&lsquo;Put the horse to the cart, Jim: I must go to
    that poor woman!&rsquo;) Comforting her with improbable stories of children
    who had been lost for days, and were none the worse for it when they were
    found. The mounted policemen out with the black trackers. Search-parties
    cooeeing to each other about the Bush, and lighting signal-fires. The reckless
    break-neck rides for news or more help. And the Boss himself, wild-eyed and
    haggard, riding about the Bush with Andy and one or two others perhaps, and
    searching hopelessly, days after the rest had given up all hope of finding
    the children alive. All this passed before me as Mrs Head talked, her voice
    sounding the while as if she were in another room; and when I roused myself
    to listen, she was on to the fairies again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was very foolish of me, Mr Ellis. Weeks after&mdash;months after,
    I think&mdash;I&rsquo;d insist on going out on the verandah at dusk and calling
    for the children. I&rsquo;d stand there and call &ldquo;Maggie!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Wally!&rdquo; until
    Walter took me inside; sometimes he had to force me inside. Poor Walter!
    But of course I didn&rsquo;t know about the fairies then, Mr Ellis. I was
    really out of my mind for a time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No wonder you were, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;It was terrible
    trouble.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, and I made it worse. I was so selfish in my trouble. But it&rsquo;s
    all right now, Walter,&rsquo; she said, rumpling the Boss&rsquo;s hair. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    never be so foolish again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course you won&rsquo;t, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;re very happy now, aren&rsquo;t we, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course we are, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And the children are coming back next year.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Next year, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He leaned over the fire and stirred it up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t take any notice of us, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she went
    on. &lsquo;Poor Walter is away so much that I&rsquo;m afraid I make a little
    too much of him when he does come home.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She paused and pressed her fingers to her temples again. Then she said quickly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They used to tell me that it was all nonsense about the fairies,
    but they were no friends of mine. I shouldn&rsquo;t have listened to them,
    Walter. You told me not to. But then I was really not in my right mind.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who used to tell you that, Mrs Head?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Voices,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;you know about the Voices, Walter?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, Maggie. But you don&rsquo;t hear the Voices now, Maggie?&rsquo; he
    asked anxiously. &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard them since I&rsquo;ve been
    away this time, have you, Maggie?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, Walter. They&rsquo;ve gone away a long time. I hear voices now
    sometimes, but they&rsquo;re the Bush Fairies&rsquo; voices. I hear them
    calling Maggie and Wally to come with them.&rsquo; She paused again. &lsquo;And
    sometimes I think I hear them call me. But of course I couldn&rsquo;t go
    away without you, Walter. But I&rsquo;m foolish again. I was going to ask
    you about the other voices, Mr Ellis. They used to say that it was madness
    about the fairies; but then, if the fairies hadn&rsquo;t taken the children,
    Black Jimmy, or the black trackers with the police, could have tracked and
    found them at once.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Of course they could, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They said that the trackers couldn&rsquo;t track them because there
    was rain a few hours after the children were lost. But that was ridiculous.
    It was only a thunderstorm.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known the blacks to track a
    man after a week&rsquo;s heavy rain.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She had her head between her fingers again, and when she looked up it was
    in a scared way.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Walter!&rsquo; she said, clutching the Boss&rsquo;s arm; &lsquo;whatever
    have I been talking about? What must Mr Ellis think of me? Oh! why did you
    let me talk like that?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He put his arm round her. Andy nudged me and got up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where are you going, Mr Ellis?&rsquo; she asked hurriedly. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
    not going to-night. Auntie&rsquo;s made a bed for you in Andy&rsquo;s room.
    You mustn&rsquo;t mind me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Jack and Andy are going out for a little while,&rsquo; said the Boss.  &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll
    be in to supper. We&rsquo;ll have a yarn, Maggie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Be sure you come back to supper, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I
    really don&rsquo;t know what you must think of me,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been
    talking all the time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed myself, Mrs Head,&rsquo; I said; and Andy
    hooked me out.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll have a good cry and be better now,&rsquo; said Andy
    when we got away from the house. &lsquo;She might be better for months. She
    has been fairly reasonable for over a year, but the Boss found her pretty
    bad when he came back this time. It upset him a lot, I can tell you. She
    has turns now and again, and always ends up like she did just now. She gets
    a longing to talk about it to a Bushman and a stranger; it seems to do her
    good. The doctor&rsquo;s against it, but doctors don&rsquo;t know everything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all true about the children, then?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s cruel true,&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And were the bodies never found?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes;&rsquo; then, after a long pause, &lsquo;I found them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You did!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; in the scrub, and not so very far from home either&mdash;and
    in a fairly clear space. It&rsquo;s a wonder the search-parties missed it;
    but it often happens that way. Perhaps the little ones wandered a long way
    and came round in a circle. I found them about two months after they were
    lost. They had to be found, if only for the Boss&rsquo;s sake. You see, in
    a case like this, and when the bodies aren&rsquo;t found, the parents never
    quite lose the idea that the little ones are wandering about the Bush to-night
    (it might be years after) and perishing from hunger, thirst, or cold. That
    mad idea haunts &rsquo;em all their lives. It&rsquo;s the same, I believe,
    with friends drowned at sea. Friends ashore are haunted for a long while
    with the idea of the white sodden corpse tossing about and drifting round
    in the water.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you never told Mrs Head about the children being found?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not for a long time. It wouldn&rsquo;t have done any good. She was
    raving mad for months. He took her to Sydney and then to Melbourne&mdash;to
    the best doctors he could find in Australia. They could do no good, so he
    sold the station&mdash;sacrificed everything, and took her to England.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;To England?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; and then to Germany to a big German doctor there. He&rsquo;d
    offer a thousand pounds where they only wanted fifty. It was no good. She
    got worse in England, and raved to go back to Australia and find the children.
    The doctors advised him to take her back, and he did. He spent all his money,
    travelling saloon, and with reserved cabins, and a nurse, and trying to get
    her cured; that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s droving now. She was restless in Sydney.
    She wanted to go back to the station and wait there till the fairies brought
    the children home. She&rsquo;d been getting the fairy idea into her head
    slowly all the time. The Boss encouraged it. But the station was sold, and
    he couldn&rsquo;t have lived there anyway without going mad himself. He&rsquo;d
    married her from Bathurst. Both of them have got friends and relations here,
    so he thought best to bring her here. He persuaded her that the fairies were
    going to bring the children here. Everybody&rsquo;s very kind to them. I
    think it&rsquo;s a mistake to run away from a town where you&rsquo;re known,
    in a case like this, though most people do it. It was years before he gave
    up hope. I think he has hopes yet&mdash;after she&rsquo;s been fairly well
    for a longish time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And you never tried telling her that the children were found?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes; the Boss did. The little ones were buried on the Lachlan river
    at first; but the Boss got a horror of having them buried in the Bush, so
    he had them brought to Sydney and buried in the Waverley Cemetery near the
    sea. He bought the ground, and room for himself and Maggie when they go out.
    It&rsquo;s all the ground he owns in wide Australia, and once he had thousands
    of acres. He took her to the grave one day. The doctors were against it;
    but he couldn&rsquo;t rest till he tried it. He took her out, and explained
    it all to her. She scarcely seemed interested. She read the names on the
    stone, and said it was a nice stone, and asked questions about how the children
    were found and brought here. She seemed quite sensible, and very cool about
    it. But when he got her home she was back on the fairy idea again. He tried
    another day, but it was no use; so then he let it be. I think it&rsquo;s
    better as it is. Now and again, at her best, she seems to understand that
    the children were found dead, and buried, and she&rsquo;ll talk sensibly
    about it, and ask questions in a quiet way, and make him promise to take
    her to Sydney to see the grave next time he&rsquo;s down. But it doesn&rsquo;t
    last long, and she&rsquo;s always worse afterwards.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We turned into a bar and had a beer. It was a very quiet drink. Andy &lsquo;shouted&rsquo; in
    his turn, and while I was drinking the second beer a thought struck me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The Boss was away when the children were lost?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Strange you couldn&rsquo;t find him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, it was strange; but&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;ll</i>&nbsp;have to tell
    you about that. Very likely he will; it&rsquo;s either all or nothing with
    him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I feel damned sorry for the Boss,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d be sorrier if you knew all,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
    the worst trouble that can happen to a man. It&rsquo;s like living with the
    dead. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s like a man living with his dead wife.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When we went home supper was ready. We found Mrs Head, bright and cheerful,
    bustling round. You&rsquo;d have thought her one of the happiest and brightest
    little women in Australia. Not a word about children or the fairies. She
    knew the Bush, and asked me all about my trips. She told some good Bush stories
    too. It was the pleasantest hour I&rsquo;d spent for a long time.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good night, Mr Ellis,&rsquo; she said brightly, shaking hands with
    me when Andy and I were going to turn in. &lsquo;And don&rsquo;t forget your
    pipe. Here it is! I know that Bushmen like to have a whiff or two when they
    turn in. Walter smokes in bed. I don&rsquo;t mind. You can smoke all night
    if you like.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She seems all right,&rsquo; I said to Andy when we were in our room.</p>
  <p>He shook his head mournfully. We&rsquo;d left the door ajar, and we could
    hear the Boss talking to her quietly. Then we heard her speak; she had a
    very clear voice.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth, Walter. I&rsquo;ve been deceiving
    you, Walter, all the time, but I did it for the best. Don&rsquo;t be angry
    with me, Walter! The Voices did come back while you were away. Oh, how I
    longed for you to come back! They haven&rsquo;t come since you&rsquo;ve been
    home, Walter. You must stay with me a while now. Those awful Voices kept
    calling me, and telling me lies about the children, Walter! They told me
    to kill myself; they told me it was all my own fault&mdash;that I killed
    the children. They said I was a drag on you, and they&rsquo;d laugh&mdash;Ha!
    ha! ha!&mdash;like that. They&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Come on, Maggie; come on,
    Maggie.&rdquo; They told me to come to the river, Walter.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy closed the door. His face was very miserable.</p>
  <p>We turned in, and I can tell you I enjoyed a soft white bed after months
    and months of sleeping out at night, between watches, on the hard ground
    or the sand, or at best on a few boughs when I wasn&rsquo;t too tired to
    pull them down, and my saddle for a pillow.</p>
  <p>But the story of the children haunted me for an hour or two. I&rsquo;ve
    never since quite made up my mind as to why the Boss took me home. Probably
    he really did think it would do his wife good to talk to a stranger; perhaps
    he wanted me to understand&mdash;maybe he was weakening as he grew older,
    and craved for a new word or hand-grip of sympathy now and then.</p>
  <p>When I did get to sleep I could have slept for three or four days, but Andy
    roused me out about four o&rsquo;clock. The old woman that they called Auntie
    was up and had a good breakfast of eggs and bacon and coffee ready in the
    detached kitchen at the back. We moved about on tiptoe and had our breakfast
    quietly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The wife made me promise to wake her to see to our breakfast and
    say Good-bye to you; but I want her to sleep this morning, Jack,&rsquo; said
    the Boss. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to walk down as far as the station with
    you. She made up a parcel of fruit and sandwiches for you and Andy. Don&rsquo;t
    forget it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy went on ahead. The Boss and I walked down the wide silent street, which
    was also the main road; and we walked two or three hundred yards without
    speaking. He didn&rsquo;t seem sociable this morning, or any way sentimental;
    when he did speak it was something about the cattle.</p>
  <p>But I had to speak; I felt a swelling and rising up in my chest, and at
    last I made a swallow and blurted out&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here, Boss, old chap! I&rsquo;m damned sorry!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Our hands came together and gripped. The ghostly Australian daybreak was
    over the Bathurst plains.</p>
  <p>We went on another hundred yards or so, and then the Boss said quietly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was away when the children were lost, Jack. I used to go on a howling
    spree every six or nine months. Maggie never knew. I&rsquo;d tell her I had
    to go to Sydney on business, or Out-Back to look after some stock. When the
    children were lost, and for nearly a fortnight after, I was beastly drunk
    in an out-of-the-way shanty in the Bush&mdash; a sly grog-shop. The old brute
    that kept it was too true to me. He thought that the story of the lost children
    was a trick to get me home, and he swore that he hadn&rsquo;t seen me. He
    never told me. I could have found those children, Jack. They were mostly
    new chums and fools about the run, and not one of the three policemen was
    a Bushman. I knew those scrubs better than any man in the country.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I reached for his hand again, and gave it a grip. That was all I could do
    for him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Jack!&rsquo; he said at the door of the brake-van. &lsquo;Good-bye,
    Andy!&mdash; keep those bullocks on their feet.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The cattle-train went on towards the Blue Mountains. Andy and I sat silent
    for a while, watching the guard fry three eggs on a plate over a coal-stove
    in the centre of the van.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Does the boss never go to Sydney?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Very seldom,&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;and then only when he has to,
    on business. When he finishes his business with the stock agents, he takes
    a run out to Waverley Cemetery perhaps, and comes home by the next train.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>After a while I said, &lsquo;He told me about the drink, Andy&mdash; about
    his being on the spree when the children were lost.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, Jack,&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the thing that&rsquo;s
    been killing him ever since, and it happened over ten years ago.&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ABushDance"></a>A Bush Dance</b></h2>
  <p>&lsquo;Tap, tap, tap, tap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The little schoolhouse and residence in the scrub was lighted brightly in
    the midst of the &lsquo;close&rsquo;, solid blackness of that moonless December
    night, when the sky and stars were smothered and suffocated by drought haze.</p>
  <p>It was the evening of the school children&rsquo;s &lsquo;Feast&rsquo;. That
    is to say that the children had been sent, and &lsquo;let go&rsquo;, and
    the younger ones  &lsquo;fetched&rsquo; through the blazing heat to the school,
    one day early in the holidays, and raced&mdash;sometimes in couples tied
    together by the legs&mdash;and caked, and bunned, and finally improved upon
    by the local Chadband, and got rid of. The schoolroom had been cleared for
    dancing, the maps rolled and tied, the desks and blackboards stacked against
    the wall outside. Tea was over, and the trestles and boards, whereon had
    been spread better things than had been provided for the unfortunate youngsters,
    had been taken outside to keep the desks and blackboards company.</p>
  <p>On stools running end to end along one side of the room sat about twenty
    more or less blooming country girls of from fifteen to twenty odd.</p>
  <p>On the rest of the stools, running end to end along the other wall, sat
    about twenty more or less blooming chaps.</p>
  <p>It was evident that something was seriously wrong. None of the girls spoke
    above a hushed whisper. None of the men spoke above a hushed oath. Now and
    again two or three sidled out, and if you had followed them you would have
    found that they went outside to listen hard into the darkness and to swear.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tap, tap, tap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The rows moved uneasily, and some of the girls turned pale faces nervously
    towards the side-door, in the direction of the sound.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tap&mdash;tap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The tapping came from the kitchen at the rear of the teacher&rsquo;s residence,
    and was uncomfortably suggestive of a coffin being made: it was also accompanied
    by a sickly, indescribable odour&mdash;more like that of warm cheap glue
    than anything else.</p>
  <p>In the schoolroom was a painful scene of strained listening. Whenever one
    of the men returned from outside, or put his head in at the door, all eyes
    were fastened on him in the flash of a single eye, and then withdrawn hopelessly.
    At the sound of a horse&rsquo;s step all eyes and ears were on the door,
    till some one muttered, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only the horses in the paddock.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Some of the girls&rsquo; eyes began to glisten suspiciously, and at last
    the belle of the party&mdash;a great, dark-haired, pink-and-white Blue Mountain
    girl, who had been sitting for a full minute staring before her, with blue
    eyes unnaturally bright, suddenly covered her face with her hands, rose,
    and started blindly from the room, from which she was steered in a hurry
    by two sympathetic and rather &lsquo;upset&rsquo; girl friends, and as she
    passed out she was heard sobbing hysterically&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t help it! I did want to dance! It&rsquo;s a sh-shame!
    I can&rsquo;t help it! I&mdash;I want to dance! I rode twenty miles to dance&mdash;and&mdash;and
    I want to dance!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A tall, strapping young Bushman rose, without disguise, and followed the
    girl out. The rest began to talk loudly of stock, dogs, and horses, and other
    Bush things; but above their voices rang out that of the girl from the outside&mdash;being
    man comforted&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Jack! I did want to dance! I&mdash;I had such&mdash;such&mdash;a
    job&mdash;to get mother&mdash;and&mdash;and father to let me come&mdash;and&mdash;and
    now!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The two girl friends came back. &lsquo;He sez to leave her to him,&rsquo; they
    whispered, in reply to an interrogatory glance from the schoolmistress.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s no use, Jack!&rsquo; came the voice of
    grief. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know what&mdash; what father and mother&mdash;is.
    I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t&mdash;be able&mdash;to ge-get away&mdash;  again&mdash;for&mdash;for&mdash;not
    till I&rsquo;m married, perhaps.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The schoolmistress glanced uneasily along the row of girls. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    take her into my room and make her lie down,&rsquo; she whispered to her
    sister, who was staying with her. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll start some of the other
    girls presently&mdash; it&rsquo;s just the weather for it,&rsquo; and she
    passed out quietly. That schoolmistress was a woman of penetration.</p>
  <p>A final &lsquo;tap-tap&rsquo; from the kitchen; then a sound like the squawk
    of a hurt or frightened child, and the faces in the room turned quickly in
    that direction and brightened. But there came a bang and a sound like &lsquo;damn!&rsquo; and
    hopelessness settled down.</p>
  <p>A shout from the outer darkness, and most of the men and some of the girls
    rose and hurried out. Fragments of conversation heard in the darkness&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s two horses, I tell you!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s three, you&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lay you&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Put the stuff up!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>A clack of gate thrown open.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Who is it, Tom?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Voices from gatewards, yelling, &lsquo;Johnny Mears! They&rsquo;ve got Johnny
    Mears!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Then rose yells, and a cheer such as is seldom heard in scrub-lands.</p>
  <p>Out in the kitchen long Dave Regan grabbed, from the far side of the table,
    where he had thrown it, a burst and battered concertina, which he had been
    for the last hour vainly trying to patch and make air-tight; and, holding
    it out towards the back-door, between his palms, as a football is held, he
    let it drop, and fetched it neatly on the toe of his riding-boot. It was
    a beautiful kick, the concertina shot out into the blackness, from which
    was projected, in return, first a short, sudden howl, then a face with one
    eye glaring and the other covered by an enormous brick-coloured hand, and
    a voice that wanted to know who shot &lsquo;that lurid loaf of bread?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But from the schoolroom was heard the loud, free voice of Joe Matthews,
    M.C.,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Take yer partners! Hurry up! Take yer partners! They&rsquo;ve got
    Johnny Mears with his fiddle!&rsquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBuckJumper"></a>The Buck-Jumper</b></h2>
  <p>Saturday&nbsp;afternoon.</p>
  <p>There were about a dozen Bush natives, from anywhere, most of them lanky
    and easy-going, hanging about the little slab-and-bark hotel on the edge
    of the scrub at Capertee Camp (a teamster&rsquo;s camp) when Cob &amp; Co.&rsquo;s
    mail-coach and six came dashing down the siding from round Crown Ridge, in
    all its glory, to the end of the twelve-mile stage. Some wiry, ill-used hacks
    were hanging to the fence and to saplings about the place. The fresh coach-horses
    stood ready in a stock-yard close to the shanty. As the coach climbed the
    nearer bank of the creek at the foot of the ridge, six of the Bushmen detached
    themselves from verandah posts, from their heels, from the clay floor of
    the verandah and the rough slab wall against which they&rsquo;d been resting,
    and joined a group of four or five who stood round one. He stood with his
    back to the corner post of the stock-yard, his feet well braced out in front
    of him, and contemplated the toes of his tight new &rsquo;lastic-side boots
    and whistled softly. He was a clean-limbed, handsome fellow, with riding-cords,
    leggings, and a blue sash; he was Graeco-Roman-nosed, blue-eyed, and his
    glossy, curly black hair bunched up in front of the brim of a new cabbage-tree
    hat, set well back on his head.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Do it for a quid, Jack?&rsquo; asked one.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Damned if I will, Jim!&rsquo; said the young man at the post. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    do it for a fiver&mdash;not a blanky sprat less.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jim took off his hat and &lsquo;shoved&rsquo; it round, and &lsquo;bobs&rsquo; were  &lsquo;chucked&rsquo; into
    it. The result was about thirty shillings.</p>
  <p>Jack glanced contemptuously into the crown of the hat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not me!&rsquo; he said, showing some emotion for the first time. &lsquo;D&rsquo;yer
    think I&rsquo;m going to risk me blanky neck for your blanky amusement for
    thirty blanky bob. I&rsquo;ll ride the blanky horse for a fiver, and I&rsquo;ll
    feel the blanky quids in my pocket before I get on.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile the coach had dashed up to the door of the shanty. There were
    about twenty passengers aboard&mdash;inside, on the box-seat, on the tail-board,
    and hanging on to the roof&mdash;most of them Sydney men going up to the
    Mudgee races. They got down and went inside with the driver for a drink,
    while the stablemen changed horses. The Bushmen raised their voices a little
    and argued.</p>
  <p>One of the passengers was a big, stout, hearty man&mdash; a good-hearted,
    sporting man and a racehorse-owner, according to his brands. He had a round
    red face and a white cork hat. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s those chaps got on outside?&rsquo;  he
    asked the publican.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s a bet they&rsquo;ve got on about riding a horse,&rsquo; replied
    the publican. &lsquo;The flash-looking chap with the sash is Flash Jack,
    the horse-breaker; and they reckon they&rsquo;ve got the champion outlaw
    in the district out there&mdash; that chestnut horse in the yard.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The sporting man was interested at once, and went out and joined the Bushmen.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, chaps! what have you got on here?&rsquo; he asked cheerily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Jim carelessly, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only a bit of a
    bet about ridin&rsquo;  that blanky chestnut in the corner of the yard there.&rsquo; He
    indicated an ungroomed chestnut horse, fenced off by a couple of long sapling
    poles in a corner of the stock-yard. &lsquo;Flash Jack there&mdash;he reckons
    he&rsquo;s the champion horse-breaker round here&mdash;Flash Jack reckons
    he can take it out of that horse first try.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s up with the horse?&rsquo; inquired the big, red-faced
    man. &lsquo;It looks quiet enough. Why, I&rsquo;d ride it myself.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Would yer?&rsquo; said Jim, who had hair that stood straight up,
    and an innocent, inquiring expression. &lsquo;Looks quiet, does he?&nbsp;<i>You</i>&nbsp;ought
    to know more about horses than to go by the looks of &rsquo;em. He&rsquo;s
    quiet enough just now, when there&rsquo;s no one near him; but you should
    have been here an hour ago. That horse has killed two men and put another
    chap&rsquo;s shoulder out&mdash;besides breaking a cove&rsquo;s leg. It took
    six of us all the morning to run him in and get the saddle on him; and now
    Flash Jack wants to back out of it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Euraliar!&rsquo; remarked Flash Jack cheerfully. &lsquo;I said I&rsquo;d
    ride that blanky horse out of the yard for a fiver. I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
    risk my blanky neck for nothing and only to amuse you blanks.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He said he&rsquo;d ride the horse inside the yard for a quid,&rsquo; said
    Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And get smashed against the rails!&rsquo; said Flash Jack. &lsquo;I
    would be a fool. I&rsquo;d rather take my chance outside in the scrub&mdash;and
    it&rsquo;s rough country round here.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, how much do you want?&rsquo; asked the man in the mushroom
    hat.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A fiver, I said,&rsquo; replied Jack indifferently. &lsquo;And the
    blanky stuff in my pocket before I get on the blanky horse.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you frightened of us running away without paying you?&rsquo;  inquired
    one of the passengers who had gathered round.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m frightened of the horse bolting with me without me being
    paid,&rsquo; said Flash Jack. &lsquo;I know that horse; he&rsquo;s got a
    mouth like iron. I might be at the bottom of the cliff on Crown Ridge road
    in twenty minutes with my head caved in, and then what chance for the quids?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t want &rsquo;em then,&rsquo; suggested a passenger. &lsquo;Or,
    say!&mdash;  we&rsquo;d leave the fiver with the publican to bury you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Flash Jack ignored that passenger. He eyed his boots and softly whistled
    a tune.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;All right!&rsquo; said the man in the cork hat, putting his hand
    in his pocket. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll start with a quid; stump up, you chaps.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The five pounds were got together.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll lay a quid to half a quid he don&rsquo;t stick on ten
    minutes!&rsquo;  shouted Jim to his mates as soon as he saw that the event
    was to come off. The passengers also betted amongst themselves. Flash Jack,
    after putting the money in his breeches-pocket, let down the rails and led
    the horse into the middle of the yard.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Quiet as an old cow!&rsquo; snorted a passenger in disgust. &lsquo;I
    believe it&rsquo;s a sell!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Wait a bit,&rsquo; said Jim to the passenger, &lsquo;wait a bit and
    you&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They waited and saw.</p>
  <p>Flash Jack leisurely mounted the horse, rode slowly out of the yard, and
    trotted briskly round the corner of the shanty and into the scrub, which
    swallowed him more completely than the sea might have done.</p>
  <p>Most of the other Bushmen mounted their horses and followed Flash Jack to
    a clearing in the scrub, at a safe distance from the shanty; then they dismounted
    and hung on to saplings, or leaned against their horses, while they laughed.</p>
  <p>At the hotel there was just time for another drink. The driver climbed to
    his seat and shouted, &lsquo;All aboard!&rsquo; in his usual tone. The passengers
    climbed to their places, thinking hard. A mile or so along the road the man
    with the cork hat remarked, with much truth&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Those blanky Bushmen have got too much time to think.&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>The Bushmen returned to the shanty as soon as the coach was out of sight,
    and proceeded to &lsquo;knock down&rsquo; the fiver.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="JimmyGrimshawsWooing"></a>Jimmy Grimshaw&rsquo;s
      Wooing.</b></h2>
  <p>The&nbsp;Half-way House at Tinned Dog (Out-Back in Australia) kept Daniel
    Myers&mdash;licensed to retail spirituous and fermented liquors&mdash; in
    drink and the horrors for upward of five years, at the end of which time
    he lay hidden for weeks in a back skillion, an object which no decent man
    would care to see&mdash;or hear when it gave forth sound. &lsquo;Good accommodation
    for man and beast&rsquo;; but few shanties save his own might, for a consideration,
    have accommodated the sort of beast which the man Myers had become towards
    the end of his career. But at last the eccentric Bush doctor, &lsquo;Doc&rsquo; Wild&rsquo; (who
    perhaps could drink as much as Myers without its having any further effect
    upon his temperament than to keep him awake and cynical), pronounced the
    publican dead enough to be buried legally; so the widow buried him, had the
    skillion cleaned out, and the sign altered to read, &lsquo;Margaret Myers,
    licensed, &amp;c.&rsquo;, and continued to conduct the pub. just as she had
    run it for over five years, with the joyful and blessed exception that there
    was no longer a human pig and pigstye attached, and that the atmosphere was
    calm. Most of the regular patrons of the Half-way House could have their
    horrors decently, and, comparatively, quietly&mdash;or otherwise have them
    privately&mdash;in the Big Scrub adjacent; but Myers had not been one of
    that sort.</p>
  <p>Mrs Myers settled herself to enjoy life comfortably and happily, at the
    fixed age of thirty-nine, for the next seven years or so. She was a pleasant-faced
    dumpling, who had been baked solid in the droughts of Out-Back without losing
    her good looks, and had put up with a hard life, and Myers, all those years
    without losing her good humour and nature. Probably, had her husband been
    the opposite kind of man, she would have been different&mdash; haggard, bad-tempered,
    and altogether impossible&mdash;for of such is woman. But then it might be
    taken into consideration that she had been practically a widow during at
    least the last five years of her husband&rsquo;s alleged life.</p>
  <p>Mrs Myers was reckoned a good catch in the district, but it soon seemed
    that she was not to be caught.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It would be a grand thing,&rsquo; one of the periodical boozers of
    Tinned Dog would say to his mates, &lsquo;for one of us to have his name
    up on a pub.; it would save a lot of money.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t save you anything, Bill, if I got it,&rsquo; was
    the retort. &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t come round chewing my lug then. I&rsquo;d
    give you one drink and no more.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The publican at Dead Camel, station managers, professional shearers, even
    one or two solvent squatters and promising cockatoos, tried their luck in
    vain. In answer to the suggestion that she ought to have a man to knock round
    and look after things, she retorted that she had had one, and was perfectly
    satisfied. Few trav&rsquo;lers on those tracks but tried &lsquo;a bit of
    bear-up&rsquo;  in that direction, but all to no purpose. Chequemen knocked
    down their cheques manfully at the Half-way House&mdash;to get courage and
    goodwill and &lsquo;put it off&rsquo;  till, at the last moment, they offered
    themselves abjectly to the landlady; which was worse than bad judgment on
    their part&mdash;it was very silly, and she told them so.</p>
  <p>One or two swore off, and swore to keep straight; but she had no faith in
    them, and when they found that out, it hurt their feelings so much that they &lsquo;broke
    out&rsquo; and went on record-breaking sprees.</p>
  <p>About the end of each shearing the sign was touched up, with an extra coat
    of paint on the &lsquo;Margaret&rsquo;, whereat suitors looked hopeless.</p>
  <p>One or two of the rejected died of love in the horrors in the Big Scrub&mdash; anyway,
    the verdict was that they died of love aggravated by the horrors. But the
    climax was reached when a Queensland shearer, seizing the opportunity when
    the mate, whose turn it was to watch him, fell asleep, went down to the yard
    and hanged himself on the butcher&rsquo;s gallows&mdash; having first removed
    his clothes, with some drink-lurid idea of leaving the world as naked as
    he came into it. He climbed the pole, sat astride on top, fixed the rope
    to neck and bar, but gave a yell&mdash; a yell of drunken triumph&mdash;before
    he dropped, and woke his mates.</p>
  <p>They cut him down and brought him to. Next day he apologised to Mrs Myers,
    said, &lsquo;Ah, well! So long!&rsquo; to the rest, and departed&mdash; cured
    of drink and love apparently. The verdict was that the blanky fool should
    have dropped before he yelled; but she was upset and annoyed, and it began
    to look as though, if she wished to continue to live on happily and comfortably
    for a few years longer at the fixed age of thirty-nine, she would either
    have to give up the pub. or get married.</p>
  <p>Her fame was carried far and wide, and she became a woman whose name was
    mentioned with respect in rough shearing-sheds and huts, and round the camp-fire.</p>
  <p>About thirty miles south of Tinned Dog one James Grimshaw, widower&mdash; otherwise
    known as &lsquo;Old Jimmy&rsquo;, though he was little past middle age&mdash;  had
    a small selection which he had worked, let, given up, and tackled afresh
    (with sinews of war drawn from fencing contracts) ever since the death of
    his young wife some fifteen years agone. He was a practical, square-faced,
    clean-shaven, clean, and tidy man, with a certain &lsquo;cleanness&rsquo; about
    the shape of his limbs which suggested the old jockey or hostler. There were
    two strong theories in connection with Jimmy&mdash;one was that he had had
    a university education, and the other that he couldn&rsquo;t write his own
    name. Not nearly such a ridiculous nor simple case Out-Back as it might seem.</p>
  <p>Jimmy smoked and listened without comment to the &lsquo;heard tells&rsquo; in
    connection with Mrs Myers, till at last one night, at the end of his contract
    and over a last pipe, he said quietly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go up to Tinned
    Dog next week and try my luck.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>His mates and the casual Jims and Bills were taken too suddenly to laugh,
    and the laugh having been lost, as Bland Holt, the Australian actor would
    put it in a professional sense, the audience had time to think, with the
    result that the joker swung his hand down through an imaginary table and
    exclaimed&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;By God! Jimmy&rsquo;ll do it.&rsquo; (Applause.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>So one drowsy afternoon at the time of the year when the breathless day
    runs on past 7&nbsp;P.M., Mrs Myers sat sewing in the bar parlour, when a
    clean-shaved, clean-shirted, clean-neckerchiefed, clean-moleskinned, greased-bluchered&mdash;altogether
    a model or stage swagman came up, was served in the bar by the half-caste
    female cook, and took his way to the river-bank, where he rigged a small
    tent and made a model camp.</p>
  <p>A couple of hours later he sat on a stool on the verandah, smoking a clean
    clay pipe. Just before the sunset meal Mrs Myers asked, &lsquo;Is that trav&rsquo;ler
    there yet, Mary?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes, missus. Clean pfellar that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The landlady knitted her forehead over her sewing, as women do when limited
    for &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; or wondering whether a section has been cut wrong&mdash; or
    perhaps she thought of that other who hadn&rsquo;t been a &lsquo;clean pfellar&rsquo;.
    She put her work aside, and stood in the doorway, looking out across the
    clearing.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-day, mister,&rsquo; she said, seeming to become aware of him
    for the first time.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-day, missus!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hot!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Hot!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Pause.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Trav&rsquo;lin&rsquo;?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, not particular!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She waited for him to explain. Myers was always explaining when he wasn&rsquo;t
    raving. But the swagman smoked on.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Have a drink?&rsquo; she suggested, to keep her end up.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, thank you, missus. I had one an hour or so ago. I never take
    more than two a-day&mdash;one before breakfast, if I can get it, and a night-cap.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>What a contrast to Myers! she thought.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come and have some tea; it&rsquo;s ready.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you. I don&rsquo;t mind if I do.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They got on very slowly, but comfortably. She got little out of him except
    the facts that he had a selection, had finished a contract, and was  &lsquo;just
    having a look at the country.&rsquo; He politely declined a &lsquo;shake-down&rsquo;,
    saying he had a comfortable camp, and preferred being out this weather. She
    got his name with a &lsquo;by-the-way&rsquo;, as he rose to leave, and he
    went back to camp.</p>
  <p>He caught a cod, and they had it for breakfast next morning, and got along
    so comfortable over breakfast that he put in the forenoon pottering about
    the gates and stable with a hammer, a saw, and a box of nails.</p>
  <p>And, well&mdash;to make it short&mdash;when the big Tinned Dog shed had
    cut-out, and the shearers struck the Half-way House, they were greatly impressed
    by a brand-new sign whereon glistened the words:</p>
  <p align="center">HALF-WAY HOUSE HOTEL<br>
      <font size="+1">By</font><br>
    JAMES GRIMSHAW<br>
  <i>GOOD STABLING</i></p>
  <p>The last time I saw Mrs Grimshaw she looked about thirty-five.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AtDeadDingo"></a>At Dead Dingo</b></h2>
  <p>It was blazing hot outside and smothering hot inside the weather-board and
    iron shanty at Dead Dingo, a place on the Cleared Road, where there was a
    pub. and a police-station, and which was sometimes called  &lsquo;Roasted&rsquo;,
    and other times &lsquo;Potted Dingo&rsquo;&mdash;nicknames suggested by the
    everlasting drought and the vicinity of the one-pub. township of Tinned Dog.</p>
  <p>From the front verandah the scene was straight-cleared road, running right
    and left to Out-Back, and to Bourke (and ankle-deep in the red sand dust
    for perhaps a hundred miles); the rest blue-grey bush, dust, and the heat-wave
    blazing across every object.</p>
  <p>There were only four in the bar-room, though it was New Year&rsquo;s Day.
    There weren&rsquo;t many more in the county. The girl sat behind the bar&mdash;the
    coolest place in the shanty&mdash;reading &lsquo;Deadwood Dick&rsquo;. On
    a worn and torn and battered horse-hair sofa, which had seen cooler places
    and better days, lay an awful and healthy example, a bearded swagman, with
    his arms twisted over his head and his face to the wall, sleeping off the
    death of the dead drunk. Bill and Jim &mdash;shearer and rouseabout&mdash;sat
    at a table playing cards. It was about three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon,
    and they had been gambling since nine&mdash;and the greater part of the night
    before&mdash;so they were, probably, in a worse condition morally (and perhaps
    physically) than the drunken swagman on the sofa.</p>
  <p>Close under the bar, in a dangerous place for his legs and tail, lay a sheep-dog
    with a chain attached to his collar and wound round his neck.</p>
  <p>Presently a thump on the table, and Bill, unlucky gambler, rose with an
    oath that would have been savage if it hadn&rsquo;t been drawled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stumped?&rsquo; inquired Jim.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Not a blanky, lurid deener!&rsquo; drawled Bill.</p>
  <p>Jim drew his reluctant hands from the cards, his eyes went slowly and hopelessly
    round the room and out the door. There was something in the eyes of both,
    except when on the card-table, of the look of a man waking in a strange place.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Got anything?&rsquo; asked Jim, fingering the cards again.</p>
  <p>Bill sucked in his cheeks, collecting the saliva with difficulty, and spat
    out on to the verandah floor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I got,&rsquo; he drawled. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s gone
    now.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jim leaned back in his chair, twisted, yawned, and caught sight of the dog.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That there dog yours?&rsquo; he asked, brightening.</p>
  <p>They had evidently been strangers the day before, or as strange to each
    other as Bushmen can be.</p>
  <p>Bill scratched behind his ear, and blinked at the dog. The dog woke suddenly
    to a flea fact.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; drawled Bill, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s mine.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m going Out-Back, and I want a dog,&rsquo; said Jim,
    gathering the cards briskly. &lsquo;Half a quid agin the dog?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Half a quid be&mdash;&mdash;!&rsquo; drawled Bill. &lsquo;Call it
    a quid?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Half a blanky quid!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A gory, lurid quid!&rsquo; drawled Bill desperately, and he stooped
    over his swag.</p>
  <p>But Jim&rsquo;s hands were itching in a ghastly way over the cards.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Alright. Call it a&mdash;&mdash;quid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The drunkard on the sofa stirred, showed signs of waking, but died again.
    Remember this, it might come in useful.</p>
  <p>Bill sat down to the table once more.</p>
  <p>Jim rose first, winner of the dog. He stretched, yawned &lsquo;Ah, well!&rsquo; and
    shouted drinks. Then he shouldered his swag, stirred the dog up with his
    foot, unwound the chain, said &lsquo;Ah, well&mdash;so long!&rsquo; and drifted
    out and along the road toward Out-Back, the dog following with head and tail
    down.</p>
  <p>Bill scored another drink on account of girl-pity for bad luck, shouldered
    his swag, said, &lsquo;So long, Mary!&rsquo; and drifted out and along the
    road towards Tinned Dog, on the Bourke side.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A long, drowsy, half hour passed&mdash;the sort of half hour that is as
    long as an hour in the places where days are as long as years, and years
    hold about as much as days do in other places.</p>
  <p>The man on the sofa woke with a start, and looked scared and wild for a
    moment; then he brought his dusty broken boots to the floor, rested his elbows
    on his knees, took his unfortunate head between his hands, and came back
    to life gradually.</p>
  <p>He lifted his head, looked at the girl across the top of the bar, and formed
    with his lips, rather than spoke, the words:</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Put up a drink?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She shook her head tightly and went on reading.</p>
  <p>He staggered up, and, leaning on the bar, made desperate distress signals
    with hand, eyes, and mouth.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No!&rsquo; she snapped. &lsquo;I means no when I says no! You&rsquo;ve
    had too many last drinks already, and the boss says you ain&rsquo;t to have
    another. If you swear again, or bother me, I&rsquo;ll call him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He hung sullenly on the counter for a while, then lurched to his swag, and
    shouldered it hopelessly and wearily. Then he blinked round, whistled, waited
    a moment, went on to the front verandah, peered round, through the heat,
    with bloodshot eyes, and whistled again. He turned and started through to
    the back-door.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What the devil do you want now?&rsquo; demanded the girl, interrupted
    in her reading for the third time by him. &lsquo;Stampin&rsquo; all over
    the house. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t go through there! It&rsquo;s privit! I
    do wish to goodness you&rsquo;d git!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where the blazes is that there dog o&rsquo; mine got to?&rsquo; he
    muttered.  &lsquo;Did you see a dog?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No! What do I want with your dog?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He whistled out in front again, and round each corner. Then he came back
    with a decided step and tone.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Look here! that there dog was lyin&rsquo; there agin the wall when
    I went to sleep. He wouldn&rsquo;t stir from me, or my swag, in a year, if
    he wasn&rsquo;t dragged. He&rsquo;s been blanky well touched [stolen], and
    I wouldn&rsquo;ter lost him for a fiver. Are you sure you ain&rsquo;t seen
    a dog?&rsquo; then suddenly, as the thought struck him: &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s
    them two chaps that was playin&rsquo; cards when I wenter sleep?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why!&rsquo; exclaimed the girl, without thinking, &lsquo;there was
    a dog, now I come to think of it, but I thought it belonged to one of them
    chaps. Anyway, they played for it, and the other chap won it and took it
    away.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He stared at her blankly, with thunder gathering in the blankness.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What sort of a dog was it?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Dog described; the chain round the neck settled it.</p>
  <p>He scowled at her darkly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Now, look here,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve allowed gamblin&rsquo; in
    this bar&mdash;  your boss has. You&rsquo;ve got no right to let spielers
    gamble away a man&rsquo;s dog. Is a customer to lose his dog every time he
    has a doze to suit your boss? I&rsquo;ll go straight across to the police
    camp and put you away, and I don&rsquo;t care if you lose your licence. I
    ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to lose my dog. I wouldn&rsquo;ter taken a ten-pound
    note for that blanky dog! I&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She was filling a pewter hastily.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here! for God&rsquo;s sake have a drink an&rsquo; stop yer row.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He drank with satisfaction. Then he hung on the bar with one elbow and scowled
    out the door.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Which blanky way did them chaps go?&rsquo; he growled.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The one that took the dog went towards Tinned Dog.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I&rsquo;ll haveter go all the blanky way back after him, and
    most likely lose me shed! Here!&rsquo; jerking the empty pewter across the
    bar, &lsquo;fill that up again; I&rsquo;m narked properly, I am, and I&rsquo;ll
    take twenty-four blanky hours to cool down now. I wouldn&rsquo;ter lost that
    dog for twenty quid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He drank again with deeper satisfaction, then he shuffled out, muttering,
    swearing, and threatening louder every step, and took the track to Tinned
    Dog.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Now the man, girl, or woman, who told me this yarn has never quite settled
    it in his or her mind as to who really owned the dog. I leave it to you.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TellingMrsBaker"></a>Telling Mrs Baker</b></h2>
  <p>Most&nbsp;Bushmen who hadn&rsquo;t &lsquo;known Bob Baker to speak to&rsquo;,
    had &lsquo;heard tell of him&rsquo;. He&rsquo;d been a squatter, not many
    years before, on the Macquarie river in New South Wales, and had made money
    in the good seasons, and had gone in for horse-racing and racehorse-breeding,
    and long trips to Sydney, where he put up at swell hotels and went the pace.
    So after a pretty severe drought, when the sheep died by thousands on his
    runs, Bob Baker went under, and the bank took over his station and put a
    manager in charge.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d been a jolly, open-handed, popular man, which means that he&rsquo;d
    been a selfish man as far as his wife and children were concerned, for they
    had to suffer for it in the end. Such generosity is often born of vanity,
    or moral cowardice, or both mixed. It&rsquo;s very nice to hear the chaps
    sing &lsquo;For he&rsquo;s a jolly good fellow&rsquo;, but you&rsquo;ve mostly
    got to pay for it twice&mdash;first in company, and afterwards alone. I once
    heard the chaps singing that I was a jolly good fellow, when I was leaving
    a place and they were giving me a send-off. It thrilled me, and brought a
    warm gush to my eyes; but, all the same, I wished I had half the money I&rsquo;d
    lent them, and spent on &rsquo;em, and I wished I&rsquo;d used the time I&rsquo;d
    wasted to be a jolly good fellow.</p>
  <p>When I first met Bob Baker he was a boss-drover on the great north-western
    route, and his wife lived at the township of Solong on the Sydney side. He
    was going north to new country round by the Gulf of Carpentaria, with a big
    mob of cattle, on a two years&rsquo; trip; and I and my mate, Andy M&lsquo;Culloch,
    engaged to go with him. We wanted to have a look at the Gulf Country.</p>
  <p>After we had crossed the Queensland border it seemed to me that the Boss
    was too fond of going into wayside shanties and town pubs. Andy had been
    with him on another trip, and he told me that the Boss was only going this
    way lately. Andy knew Mrs Baker well, and seemed to think a deal of her. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
    a good little woman,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;One of the right stuff. I worked
    on their station for a while when I was a nipper, and I know. She was always
    a damned sight too good for the Boss, but she believed in him. When I was
    coming away this time she says to me, &ldquo;Look here, Andy, I&rsquo;m afraid
    Robert is drinking again. Now I want you to look after him for me, as much
    as you can&mdash; you seem to have as much influence with him as any one.
    I want you to promise me that you&rsquo;ll never have a drink with him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I promised,&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll keep my word.&rsquo; Andy
    was a chap who could keep his word, and nothing else. And, no matter how
    the Boss persuaded, or sneered, or swore at him, Andy would never drink with
    him.</p>
  <p>It got worse and worse: the Boss would ride on ahead and get drunk at a
    shanty, and sometimes he&rsquo;d be days behind us; and when he&rsquo;d catch
    up to us his temper would be just about as much as we could stand. At last
    he went on a howling spree at Mulgatown, about a hundred and fifty miles
    north of the border, and, what was worse, he got in tow with a flash barmaid
    there&mdash;one of those girls who are engaged, by the publicans up country,
    as baits for chequemen.</p>
  <p>He went mad over that girl. He drew an advance cheque from the stock-owner&rsquo;s
    agent there, and knocked that down; then he raised some more money somehow,
    and spent that&mdash;mostly on the girl.</p>
  <p>We did all we could. Andy got him along the track for a couple of stages,
    and just when we thought he was all right, he slipped us in the night and
    went back.</p>
  <p>We had two other men with us, but had the devil&rsquo;s own bother on account
    of the cattle. It was a mixed-up job all round. You see it was all big runs
    round there, and we had to keep the bullocks moving along the route all the
    time, or else get into trouble for trespass. The agent wasn&rsquo;t going
    to go to the expense of putting the cattle in a paddock until the Boss sobered
    up; there was very little grass on the route or the travelling-stock reserves
    or camps, so we had to keep travelling for grass.</p>
  <p>The world might wobble and all the banks go bung, but the cattle have to
    go through&mdash;that&rsquo;s the law of the stock-routes. So the agent wired
    to the owners, and, when he got their reply, he sacked the Boss and sent
    the cattle on in charge of another man. The new Boss was a drover coming
    south after a trip; he had his two brothers with him, so he didn&rsquo;t
    want me and Andy; but, anyway, we were full up of this trip, so we arranged,
    between the agent and the new Boss, to get most of the wages due to us&mdash; the
    Boss had drawn some of our stuff and spent it.</p>
  <p>We could have started on the back track at once, but, drunk or sober, mad
    or sane, good or bad, it isn&rsquo;t Bush religion to desert a mate in a
    hole; and the Boss was a mate of ours; so we stuck to him.</p>
  <p>We camped on the creek, outside the town, and kept him in the camp with
    us as much as possible, and did all we could for him.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How could I face his wife if I went home without him?&rsquo; asked
    Andy, &lsquo;or any of his old mates?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The Boss got himself turned out of the pub. where the barmaid was, and then
    he&rsquo;d hang round the other pubs., and get drink somehow, and fight,
    and get knocked about. He was an awful object by this time, wild-eyed and
    gaunt, and he hadn&rsquo;t washed or shaved for days.</p>
  <p>Andy got the constable in charge of the police station to lock him up for
    a night, but it only made him worse: we took him back to the camp next morning
    and while our eyes were off him for a few minutes he slipped away into the
    scrub, stripped himself naked, and started to hang himself to a leaning tree
    with a piece of clothes-line rope. We got to him just in time.</p>
  <p>Then Andy wired to the Boss&rsquo;s brother Ned, who was fighting the drought,
    the rabbit-pest, and the banks, on a small station back on the border. Andy
    reckoned it was about time to do something.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the Boss hadn&rsquo;t been quite right in his head before he started
    drinking&mdash;he had acted queer some time, now we came to think of it;
    maybe he&rsquo;d got a touch of sunstroke or got brooding over his troubles&mdash; anyway
    he died in the horrors within the week.</p>
  <p>His brother Ned turned up on the last day, and Bob thought he was the devil,
    and grappled with him. It took the three of us to hold the Boss down sometimes.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, towards the end, he&rsquo;d be sensible for a few minutes and
    talk about his &lsquo;poor wife and children&rsquo;; and immediately afterwards
    he&rsquo;d fall a-cursing me, and Andy, and Ned, and calling us devils. He
    cursed everything; he cursed his wife and children, and yelled that they
    were dragging him down to hell. He died raving mad. It was the worst case
    of death in the horrors of drink that I ever saw or heard of in the Bush.</p>
  <p>Ned saw to the funeral: it was very hot weather, and men have to be buried
    quick who die out there in the hot weather&mdash;especially men who die in
    the state the Boss was in. Then Ned went to the public-house where the barmaid
    was and called the landlord out. It was a desperate fight: the publican was
    a big man, and a bit of a fighting man; but Ned was one of those quiet, simple-minded
    chaps who will carry a thing through to death when they make up their minds.
    He gave that publican nearly as good a thrashing as he deserved. The constable
    in charge of the station backed Ned, while another policeman picked up the
    publican. Sounds queer to you city people, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>
  <p>Next morning we three started south. We stayed a couple of days at Ned Baker&rsquo;s
    station on the border, and then started on our three-hundred-mile ride down-country.
    The weather was still very hot, so we decided to travel at night for a while,
    and left Ned&rsquo;s place at dusk. He parted from us at the homestead gate.
    He gave Andy a small packet, done up in canvas, for Mrs Baker, which Andy
    told me contained Bob&rsquo;s pocket-book, letters, and papers. We looked
    back, after we&rsquo;d gone a piece along the dusty road, and saw Ned still
    standing by the gate; and a very lonely figure he looked. Ned was a bachelor. &lsquo;Poor
    old Ned,&rsquo; said Andy to me. &lsquo;He was in love with Mrs Bob Baker
    before she got married, but she picked the wrong man&mdash;girls mostly do.
    Ned and Bob were together on the Macquarie, but Ned left when his brother
    married, and he&rsquo;s been up in these God-forsaken scrubs ever since.
    Look, I want to tell you something, Jack: Ned has written to Mrs Bob to tell
    her that Bob died of fever, and everything was done for him that could be
    done, and that he died easy&mdash; and all that sort of thing. Ned sent her
    some money, and she is to think that it was the money due to Bob when he
    died. Now I&rsquo;ll have to go and see her when we get to Solong; there&rsquo;s
    no getting out of it, I&rsquo;ll have to face her&mdash; and you&rsquo;ll
    have to come with me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Damned if I will!&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have
    to stick to me; you&rsquo;re surely not crawler enough to desert a mate in
    a case like this? I&rsquo;ll have to lie like hell&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have
    to lie as I never lied to a woman before; and you&rsquo;ll have to back me
    and corroborate every lie.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d never seen Andy show so much emotion.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s plenty of time to fix up a good yarn,&rsquo; said Andy.
    He said no more about Mrs Baker, and we only mentioned the Boss&rsquo;s name
    casually, until we were within about a day&rsquo;s ride of Solong; then Andy
    told me the yarn he&rsquo;d made up about the Boss&rsquo;s death.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And I want you to listen, Jack,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and remember
    every word&mdash; and if you can fix up a better yarn you can tell me afterwards.
    Now it was like this: the Boss wasn&rsquo;t too well when he crossed the
    border. He complained of pains in his back and head and a stinging pain in
    the back of his neck, and he had dysentery bad,&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t
    matter; it&rsquo;s lucky I ain&rsquo;t supposed to tell a woman all the symptoms.
    The Boss stuck to the job as long as he could, but we managed the cattle
    and made it as easy as we could for him. He&rsquo;d just take it easy, and
    ride on from camp to camp, and rest. One night I rode to a town off the route
    (or you did, if you like) and got some medicine for him; that made him better
    for a while, but at last, a day or two this side of Mulgatown, he had to
    give up. A squatter there drove him into town in his buggy and put him up
    at the best hotel. The publican knew the Boss and did all he could for him&mdash; put
    him in the best room and wired for another doctor. We wired for Ned as soon
    as we saw how bad the Boss was, and Ned rode night and day and got there
    three days before the Boss died. The Boss was a bit off his head some of
    the time with the fever, but was calm and quiet towards the end and died
    easy. He talked a lot about his wife and children, and told us to tell the
    wife not to fret but to cheer up for the children&rsquo;s sake. How does
    that sound?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d been thinking while I listened, and an idea struck me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why not let her know the truth?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
    sure to hear of it sooner or later; and if she knew he was only a selfish,
    drunken blackguard she might get over it all the sooner.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t know women, Jack,&rsquo; said Andy quietly. &lsquo;And,
    anyway, even if she is a sensible woman, we&rsquo;ve got a dead mate to consider
    as well as a living woman.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;But she&rsquo;s sure to hear the truth sooner or later,&rsquo; I
    said, &lsquo;the Boss was so well known.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And that&rsquo;s just the reason why the truth might be kept from
    her,&rsquo;  said Andy. &lsquo;If he wasn&rsquo;t well known&mdash;and nobody
    could help liking him, after all, when he was straight&mdash;if he wasn&rsquo;t
    so well known the truth might leak out unawares. She won&rsquo;t know if
    I can help it, or at least not yet a while. If I see any chaps that come
    from the North I&rsquo;ll put them up to it. I&rsquo;ll tell M&lsquo;Grath,
    the publican at Solong, too: he&rsquo;s a straight man&mdash;he&rsquo;ll
    keep his ears open and warn chaps. One of Mrs Baker&rsquo;s sisters is staying
    with her, and I&rsquo;ll give her a hint so that she can warn off any women
    that might get hold of a yarn. Besides, Mrs Baker is sure to go and live
    in Sydney, where all her people are&mdash; she was a Sydney girl; and she&rsquo;s
    not likely to meet any one there that will tell her the truth. I can tell
    her that it was the last wish of the Boss that she should shift to Sydney.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We smoked and thought a while, and by-and-by Andy had what he called a &lsquo;happy
    thought&rsquo;. He went to his saddle-bags and got out the small canvas packet
    that Ned had given him: it was sewn up with packing-thread, and Andy ripped
    it open with his pocket-knife.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What are you doing, Andy?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ned&rsquo;s an innocent old fool, as far as sin is concerned,&rsquo; said
    Andy. &lsquo;I guess he hasn&rsquo;t looked through the Boss&rsquo;s letters,
    and I&rsquo;m just going to see that there&rsquo;s nothing here that will
    make liars of us.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He looked through the letters and papers by the light of the fire. There
    were some letters from Mrs Baker to her husband, also a portrait of her and
    the children; these Andy put aside. But there were other letters from barmaids
    and women who were not fit to be seen in the same street with the Boss&rsquo;s
    wife; and there were portraits &mdash;one or two flash ones. There were two
    letters from other men&rsquo;s wives too.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And one of those men, at least, was an old mate of his!&rsquo; said
    Andy, in a tone of disgust.</p>
  <p>He threw the lot into the fire; then he went through the Boss&rsquo;s pocket-book
    and tore out some leaves that had notes and addresses on them, and burnt
    them too. Then he sewed up the packet again and put it away in his saddle-bag.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Such is life!&rsquo; said Andy, with a yawn that might have been
    half a sigh.</p>
  <p>We rode into Solong early in the day, turned our horses out in a paddock,
    and put up at M&lsquo;Grath&rsquo;s pub. until such time as we made up our
    minds as to what we&rsquo;d do or where we&rsquo;d go. We had an idea of
    waiting until the shearing season started and then making Out-Back to the
    big sheds.</p>
  <p>Neither of us was in a hurry to go and face Mrs Baker. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll
    go after dinner,&rsquo; said Andy at first; then after dinner we had a drink,
    and felt sleepy&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t used to big dinners of roast-beef
    and vegetables and pudding, and, besides, it was drowsy weather&mdash; so
    we decided to have a snooze and then go. When we woke up it was late in the
    afternoon, so we thought we&rsquo;d put it off till after tea. &lsquo;It
    wouldn&rsquo;t be manners to walk in while they&rsquo;re at tea,&rsquo; said
    Andy&mdash; &lsquo;it would look as if we only came for some grub.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But while we were at tea a little girl came with a message that Mrs Baker
    wanted to see us, and would be very much obliged if we&rsquo;d call up as
    soon as possible. You see, in those small towns you can&rsquo;t move without
    the thing getting round inside of half an hour.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll have to face the music now!&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;and
    no get out of it.&rsquo; He seemed to hang back more than I did. There was
    another pub. opposite where Mrs Baker lived, and when we got up the street
    a bit I said to Andy&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Suppose we go and have another drink first, Andy? We might be kept
    in there an hour or two.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want another drink,&rsquo; said Andy, rather short. &lsquo;Why,
    you seem to be going the same way as the Boss!&rsquo; But it was Andy that
    edged off towards the pub. when we got near Mrs Baker&rsquo;s place. &lsquo;All
    right!&rsquo; he said.  &lsquo;Come on! We&rsquo;ll have this other drink,
    since you want it so bad.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>We had the drink, then we buttoned up our coats and started across the road&mdash; we&rsquo;d
    bought new shirts and collars, and spruced up a bit. Half-way across Andy
    grabbed my arm and asked&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;How do you feel now, Jack?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh,&nbsp;<i>I&rsquo;m</i>&nbsp;all right,&rsquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake!&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t put your
    foot in it and make a mess of it.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t, if you don&rsquo;t.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Baker&rsquo;s cottage was a little weather-board box affair back in
    a garden. When we went in through the gate Andy gripped my arm again and
    whispered&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake stick to me now, Jack!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll stick all right,&rsquo; I said&mdash;&lsquo;you&rsquo;ve
    been having too much beer, Andy.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I had seen Mrs Baker before, and remembered her as a cheerful, contented
    sort of woman, bustling about the house and getting the Boss&rsquo;s shirts
    and things ready when we started North. Just the sort of woman that is contented
    with housework and the children, and with nothing particular about her in
    the way of brains. But now she sat by the fire looking like the ghost of
    herself. I wouldn&rsquo;t have recognised her at first. I never saw such
    a change in a woman, and it came like a shock to me.</p>
  <p>Her sister let us in, and after a first glance at Mrs Baker I had eyes for
    the sister and no one else. She was a Sydney girl, about twenty-four or twenty-five,
    and fresh and fair&mdash; not like the sun-browned women we were used to
    see. She was a pretty, bright-eyed girl, and seemed quick to understand,
    and very sympathetic. She had been educated, Andy had told me, and wrote
    stories for the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;and other Sydney papers.
    She had her hair done and was dressed in the city style, and that took us
    back a bit at first.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very good of you to come,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker in a weak,
    weary voice, when we first went in. &lsquo;I heard you were in town.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We were just coming when we got your message,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;We&rsquo;d
    have come before, only we had to see to the horses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker.</p>
  <p>They wanted us to have tea, but we said we&rsquo;d just had it. Then Miss
    Standish (the sister) wanted us to have tea and cake; but we didn&rsquo;t
    feel as if we could handle cups and saucers and pieces of cake successfully
    just then.</p>
  <p>There was something the matter with one of the children in a back-room,
    and the sister went to see to it. Mrs Baker cried a little quietly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You mustn&rsquo;t mind me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be
    all right presently, and then I want you to tell me all about poor Bob. It&rsquo;s
    seeing you, that saw the last of him, that set me off.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy and I sat stiff and straight, on two chairs against the wall, and held
    our hats tight, and stared at a picture of Wellington meeting Bl&uuml;cher
    on the opposite wall. I thought it was lucky that that picture was there.</p>
  <p>The child was calling &lsquo;mumma&rsquo;, and Mrs Baker went in to it,
    and her sister came out. &lsquo;Best tell her all about it and get it over,&rsquo; she
    whispered to Andy. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll never be content until she hears all
    about poor Bob from some one who was with him when he died. Let me take your
    hats. Make yourselves comfortable.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>She took the hats and put them on the sewing-machine. I wished she&rsquo;d
    let us keep them, for now we had nothing to hold on to, and nothing to do
    with our hands; and as for being comfortable, we were just about as comfortable
    as two cats on wet bricks.</p>
  <p>When Mrs Baker came into the room she brought little Bobby Baker, about
    four years old; he wanted to see Andy. He ran to Andy at once, and Andy took
    him up on his knee. He was a pretty child, but he reminded me too much of
    his father.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you&rsquo;ve come, Andy!&rsquo; said Bobby.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you, Bobby?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes. I wants to ask you about daddy. You saw him go away, didn&rsquo;t
    you?&rsquo; and he fixed his great wondering eyes on Andy&rsquo;s face.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He went up among the stars, didn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And he isn&rsquo;t coming back to Bobby any more?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;But Bobby&rsquo;s going to him by-and-by.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Baker had been leaning back in her chair, resting her head on her hand,
    tears glistening in her eyes; now she began to sob, and her sister took her
    out of the room.</p>
  <p>Andy looked miserable. &lsquo;I wish to God I was off this job!&rsquo; he
    whispered to me.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is that the girl that writes the stories?&rsquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, staring at me in a hopeless sort of way, &lsquo;and
    poems too.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Is Bobby going up among the stars?&rsquo; asked Bobby.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy&mdash;&lsquo;if Bobby&rsquo;s good.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And auntie?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And mumma?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you going, Andy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy hopelessly.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Did you see daddy go up amongst the stars, Andy?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy, &lsquo;I saw him go up.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And he isn&rsquo;t coming down again any more?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Because he&rsquo;s going to wait up there for you and mumma, Bobby.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>There was a long pause, and then Bobby asked&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Are you going to give me a shilling, Andy?&rsquo; with the same expression
    of innocent wonder in his eyes.</p>
  <p>Andy slipped half-a-crown into his hand. &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo; came in and
    told him he&rsquo;d see Andy in the morning and took him away to bed, after
    he&rsquo;d kissed us both solemnly; and presently she and Mrs Baker settled
    down to hear Andy&rsquo;s story.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Brace up now, Jack, and keep your wits about you,&rsquo; whispered
    Andy to me just before they came in.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Poor Bob&rsquo;s brother Ned wrote to me,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker, &lsquo;but
    he scarcely told me anything. Ned&rsquo;s a good fellow, but he&rsquo;s very
    simple, and never thinks of anything.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy told her about the Boss not being well after he crossed the border.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I knew he was not well,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker, &lsquo;before he left.
    I didn&rsquo;t want him to go. I tried hard to persuade him not to go this
    trip. I had a feeling that I oughtn&rsquo;t to let him go. But he&rsquo;d
    never think of anything but me and the children. He promised he&rsquo;d give
    up droving after this trip, and get something to do near home. The life was
    too much for him&mdash;riding in all weathers and camping out in the rain,
    and living like a dog. But he was never content at home. It was all for the
    sake of me and the children. He wanted to make money and start on a station
    again. I shouldn&rsquo;t have let him go. He only thought of me and the children!
    Oh! my poor, dear, kind, dead husband!&rsquo; She broke down again and sobbed,
    and her sister comforted her, while Andy and I stared at Wellington meeting
    Blucher on the field of Waterloo. I thought the artist had heaped up the
    dead a bit extra, and I thought that I wouldn&rsquo;t like to be trod on
    by horses, even if I was dead.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind,&rsquo; said Miss Standish, &lsquo;she&rsquo;ll
    be all right presently,&rsquo; and she handed us the&nbsp;<i>Illustrated
    Sydney Journal</i>. This was a great relief, &mdash;we bumped our heads over
    the pictures.</p>
  <p>Mrs Baker made Andy go on again, and he told her how the Boss broke down
    near Mulgatown. Mrs Baker was opposite him and Miss Standish opposite me.
    Both of them kept their eyes on Andy&rsquo;s face: he sat, with his hair
    straight up like a brush as usual, and kept his big innocent grey eyes fixed
    on Mrs Baker&rsquo;s face all the time he was speaking. I watched Miss Standish.
    I thought she was the prettiest girl I&rsquo;d ever seen; it was a bad case
    of love at first sight, but she was far and away above me, and the case was
    hopeless. I began to feel pretty miserable, and to think back into the past:
    I just heard Andy droning away by my side.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;So we fixed him up comfortable in the waggonette with the blankets
    and coats and things,&rsquo; Andy was saying, &lsquo;and the squatter started
    into Mulgatown. . . . It was about thirty miles, Jack, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; he
    asked, turning suddenly to me. He always looked so innocent that there were
    times when I itched to knock him down.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;More like thirty-five,&rsquo; I said, waking up.</p>
  <p>Miss Standish fixed her eyes on me, and I had another look at Wellington
    and Blucher.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They were all very good and kind to the Boss,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;They
    thought a lot of him up there. Everybody was fond of him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker. &lsquo;Nobody could help liking
    him. He was one of the kindest men that ever lived.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tanner, the publican, couldn&rsquo;t have been kinder to his own
    brother,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;The local doctor was a decent chap, but
    he was only a young fellow, and Tanner hadn&rsquo;t much faith in him, so
    he wired for an older doctor at Mackintyre, and he even sent out fresh horses
    to meet the doctor&rsquo;s buggy. Everything was done that could be done,
    I assure you, Mrs Baker.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I believe it,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker. &lsquo;And you don&rsquo;t know
    how it relieves me to hear it. And did the publican do all this at his own
    expense?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t take a penny, Mrs Baker.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He must have been a good true man. I wish I could thank him.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, Ned thanked him for you,&rsquo; said Andy, though without meaning
    more than he said.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have fancied that Ned would have thought of that,&rsquo;  said
    Mrs Baker. &lsquo;When I first heard of my poor husband&rsquo;s death, I
    thought perhaps he&rsquo;d been drinking again&mdash;that worried me a bit.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He never touched a drop after he left Solong, I can assure you, Mrs
    Baker,&rsquo; said Andy quickly.</p>
  <p>Now I noticed that Miss Standish seemed surprised or puzzled, once or twice,
    while Andy was speaking, and leaned forward to listen to him; then she leaned
    back in her chair and clasped her hands behind her head and looked at him,
    with half-shut eyes, in a way I didn&rsquo;t like. Once or twice she looked
    at me as if she was going to ask me a question, but I always looked away
    quick and stared at Blucher and Wellington, or into the empty fireplace,
    till I felt that her eyes were off me. Then she asked Andy a question or
    two, in all innocence I believe now, but it scared him, and at last he watched
    his chance and winked at her sharp. Then she gave a little gasp and shut
    up like a steel trap.</p>
  <p>The sick child in the bedroom coughed and cried again. Mrs Baker went to
    it. We three sat like a deaf-and-dumb institution, Andy and I staring all
    over the place: presently Miss Standish excused herself, and went out of
    the room after her sister. She looked hard at Andy as she left the room,
    but he kept his eyes away.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Brace up now, Jack,&rsquo; whispered Andy to me, &lsquo;the worst
    is coming.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When they came in again Mrs Baker made Andy go on with his story.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&mdash;he died very quietly,&rsquo; said Andy, hitching round,
    and resting his elbows on his knees, and looking into the fireplace so as
    to have his face away from the light. Miss Standish put her arm round her
    sister. &lsquo;He died very easy,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;He was a bit off
    his head at times, but that was while the fever was on him. He didn&rsquo;t
    suffer much towards the end&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think he suffered at all.
    . . . He talked a lot about you and the children.&rsquo; (Andy was speaking
    very softly now.) &lsquo;He said that you were not to fret, but to cheer
    up for the children&rsquo;s sake. . . . It was the biggest funeral ever seen
    round there.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Baker was crying softly. Andy got the packet half out of his pocket,
    but shoved it back again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The only thing that hurts me now,&rsquo; says Mrs Baker presently, &lsquo;is
    to think of my poor husband buried out there in the lonely Bush, so far from
    home. It&rsquo;s&mdash;cruel!&rsquo; and she was sobbing again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Mrs Baker,&rsquo; said Andy, losing his
    head a little. &lsquo;Ned will see to that. Ned is going to arrange to have
    him brought down and buried in Sydney.&rsquo; Which was about the first thing
    Andy had told her that evening that wasn&rsquo;t a lie. Ned had said he would
    do it as soon as he sold his wool.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s very kind indeed of Ned,&rsquo; sobbed Mrs Baker. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have dreamed he was so kind-hearted and thoughtful. I misjudged him
    all along. And that is all you have to tell me about poor Robert?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Andy&mdash;then one of his &lsquo;happy thoughts&rsquo; struck
    him.  &lsquo;Except that he hoped you&rsquo;d shift to Sydney, Mrs Baker,
    where you&rsquo;ve got friends and relations. He thought it would be better
    for you and the children. He told me to tell you that.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He was thoughtful up to the end,&rsquo; said Mrs Baker. &lsquo;It
    was just like poor Robert&mdash;always thinking of me and the children. We
    are going to Sydney next week.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy looked relieved. We talked a little more, and Miss Standish wanted
    to make coffee for us, but we had to go and see to our horses. We got up
    and bumped against each other, and got each other&rsquo;s hats, and promised
    Mrs Baker we&rsquo;d come again.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Thank you very much for coming,&rsquo; she said, shaking hands with
    us.  &lsquo;I feel much better now. You don&rsquo;t know how much you have
    relieved me. Now, mind, you have promised to come and see me again for the
    last time.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Andy caught her sister&rsquo;s eye and jerked his head towards the door
    to let her know he wanted to speak to her outside.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Good-bye, Mrs Baker,&rsquo; he said, holding on to her hand. &lsquo;And
    don&rsquo;t you fret. You&rsquo;ve&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got the children yet.
    It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s all for the best; and, besides, the Boss said
    you wasn&rsquo;t to fret.&rsquo; And he blundered out after me and Miss Standish.</p>
  <p>She came out to the gate with us, and Andy gave her the packet.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want you to give that to her,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
    his letters and papers. I hadn&rsquo;t the heart to give it to her, somehow.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell me, Mr M&rsquo;Culloch,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve
    kept something back&mdash;  you haven&rsquo;t told her the truth. It would
    be better and safer for me to know. Was it an accident&mdash;or the drink?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It was the drink,&rsquo; said Andy. &lsquo;I was going to tell you&mdash; I
    thought it would be best to tell you. I had made up my mind to do it, but,
    somehow, I couldn&rsquo;t have done it if you hadn&rsquo;t asked me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Tell me all,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It would be better for me to
    know.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Come a little farther away from the house,&rsquo; said Andy. She
    came along the fence a piece with us, and Andy told her as much of the truth
    as he could.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll hurry her off to Sydney,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;We can
    get away this week as well as next.&rsquo; Then she stood for a minute before
    us, breathing quickly, her hands behind her back and her eyes shining in
    the moonlight. She looked splendid.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I want to thank you for her sake,&rsquo; she said quickly. &lsquo;You
    are good men! I like the Bushmen! They are grand men&mdash;they are noble!
    I&rsquo;ll probably never see either of you again, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rsquo; and
    she put her white hand on Andy&rsquo;s shoulder and kissed him fair and square
    on the mouth. &lsquo;And you, too!&rsquo; she said to me. I was taller than
    Andy, and had to stoop. &lsquo;Good-bye!&rsquo; she said, and ran to the
    gate and in, waving her hand to us. We lifted our hats again and turned down
    the road.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t think it did either of us any harm.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AHeroinDingoScrubs"></a>A Hero in Dingo-Scrubs</b></h2>
  <p>This&nbsp;is a story&mdash;about the only one&mdash;of Job Falconer, Boss
    of the Talbragar sheep-station up country in New South Wales in the early
    Eighties&mdash;when there were still runs in the Dingo-Scrubs out of the
    hands of the banks, and yet squatters who lived on their stations.</p>
  <p>Job would never tell the story himself, at least not complete, and as his
    family grew up he would become as angry as it was in his easy-going nature
    to become if reference were made to the incident in his presence. But his
    wife&mdash;little, plump, bright-eyed Gerty Falconer&mdash; often told the
    story (in the mysterious voice which women use in speaking of private matters
    amongst themselves&mdash;but with brightening eyes) to women friends over
    tea; and always to a new woman friend. And on such occasions she would be
    particularly tender towards the unconscious Job, and ruffle his thin, sandy
    hair in a way that embarrassed him in company&mdash;made him look as sheepish
    as an old big-horned ram that has just been shorn and turned amongst the
    ewes. And the woman friend on parting would give Job&rsquo;s hand a squeeze
    which would surprise him mildly, and look at him as if she could love him.</p>
  <p>According to a theory of mine, Job, to fit the story, should have been tall,
    and dark, and stern, or gloomy and quick-tempered. But he wasn&rsquo;t. He
    was fairly tall, but he was fresh-complexioned and sandy (his skin was pink
    to scarlet in some weathers, with blotches of umber), and his eyes were pale-grey;
    his big forehead loomed babyishly, his arms were short, and his legs bowed
    to the saddle. Altogether he was an awkward, unlovely Bush bird&mdash;on
    foot; in the saddle it was different. He hadn&rsquo;t even a &lsquo;temper&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>The impression on Job&rsquo;s mind which many years afterwards brought about
    the incident was strong enough. When Job was a boy of fourteen he saw his
    father&rsquo;s horse come home riderless&mdash;circling and snorting up by
    the stockyard, head jerked down whenever the hoof trod on one of the snapped
    ends of the bridle-reins, and saddle twisted over the side with bruised pommel
    and knee-pad broken off.</p>
  <p>Job&rsquo;s father wasn&rsquo;t hurt much, but Job&rsquo;s mother, an emotional
    woman, and then in a delicate state of health, survived the shock for three
    months only. &lsquo;She wasn&rsquo;t quite right in her head,&rsquo; they
    said, &lsquo;from the day the horse came home till the last hour before she
    died.&rsquo; And, strange to say, Job&rsquo;s father (from whom Job inherited
    his seemingly placid nature) died three months later. The doctor from the
    town was of the opinion that he must have &lsquo;sustained internal injuries&rsquo; when
    the horse threw him. &lsquo;Doc. Wild&rsquo; (eccentric Bush doctor) reckoned
    that Job&rsquo;s father was hurt inside when his wife died, and hurt so badly
    that he couldn&rsquo;t pull round. But doctors differ all over the world.</p>
  <p>Well, the story of Job himself came about in this way. He had been married
    a year, and had lately started wool-raising on a pastoral lease he had taken
    up at Talbragar: it was a new run, with new slab-and-bark huts on the creek
    for a homestead, new shearing-shed, yards&mdash;wife and everything new,
    and he was expecting a baby. Job felt brand-new himself at the time, so he
    said. It was a lonely place for a young woman; but Gerty was a settler&rsquo;s
    daughter. The newness took away some of the loneliness, she said, and there
    was truth in that: a Bush home in the scrubs looks lonelier the older it
    gets, and ghostlier in the twilight, as the bark and slabs whiten, or rather
    grow grey, in fierce summers. And there&rsquo;s nothing under God&rsquo;s
    sky so weird, so aggressively lonely, as a deserted old home in the Bush.</p>
  <p>Job&rsquo;s wife had a half-caste gin for company when Job was away on the
    run, and the nearest white woman (a hard but honest Lancashire woman from
    within the kicking radius in Lancashire&mdash;wife of a selector) was only
    seven miles away. She promised to be on hand, and came over two or three
    times a-week; but Job grew restless as Gerty&rsquo;s time drew near, and
    wished that he had insisted on sending her to the nearest town (thirty miles
    away), as originally proposed. Gerty&rsquo;s mother, who lived in town, was
    coming to see her over her trouble; Job had made arrangements with the town
    doctor, but prompt attendance could hardly be expected of a doctor who was
    very busy, who was too fat to ride, and who lived thirty miles away.</p>
  <p>Job, in common with most Bushmen and their families round there, had more
    faith in Doc. Wild, a weird Yankee who made medicine in a saucepan, and worked
    more cures on Bushmen than did the other three doctors of the district together&mdash;maybe
    because the Bushmen had faith in him, or he knew the Bush and Bush constitutions&mdash;or,
    perhaps, because he&rsquo;d do things which no  &lsquo;respectable practitioner&rsquo; dared
    do. I&rsquo;ve described him in another story. Some said he was a quack,
    and some said he wasn&rsquo;t. There are scores of wrecks and mysteries like
    him in the Bush. He drank fearfully, and &lsquo;on his own&rsquo;, but was
    seldom incapable of performing an operation. Experienced Bushmen preferred
    him three-quarters drunk: when perfectly sober he was apt to be a bit shaky.
    He was tall, gaunt, had a pointed black moustache, bushy eyebrows, and piercing
    black eyes. His movements were eccentric. He lived where he happened to be&mdash;in
    a town hotel, in the best room of a homestead, in the skillion of a sly-grog
    shanty, in a shearer&rsquo;s, digger&rsquo;s, shepherd&rsquo;s, or boundary-rider&rsquo;s
    hut; in a surveyor&rsquo;s camp or a black-fellows&rsquo; camp&mdash; or,
    when the horrors were on him, by a log in the lonely Bush. It seemed all
    one to him. He lost all his things sometimes&mdash;  even his clothes; but
    he never lost a pigskin bag which contained his surgical instruments and
    papers. Except once; then he gave the blacks 5 Pounds to find it for him.</p>
  <p>His patients included all, from the big squatter to Black Jimmy; and he
    rode as far and fast to a squatter&rsquo;s home as to a swagman&rsquo;s camp.
    When nothing was to be expected from a poor selector or a station hand, and
    the doctor was hard up, he went to the squatter for a few pounds. He had
    on occasions been offered cheques of &pound;50 and &pound;100 by squatters
    for &lsquo;pulling round&rsquo;  their wives or children; but such offers
    always angered him. When he asked for  &pound;5 he resented being offered
    a &pound;10 cheque. He once sued a doctor for alleging that he held no diploma;
    but the magistrate, on reading certain papers, suggested a settlement out
    of court, which both doctors agreed to&mdash;the other doctor apologising
    briefly in the local paper. It was noticed thereafter that the magistrate
    and town doctors treated Doc. Wild with great respect&mdash;even at his worst.
    The thing was never explained, and the case deepened the mystery which surrounded
    Doc. Wild.</p>
  <p>As Job Falconer&rsquo;s crisis approached Doc. Wild was located at a shanty
    on the main road, about half-way between Job&rsquo;s station and the town.
    (Township of Come-by-Chance&mdash;expressive name; and the shanty was the &lsquo;Dead
    Dingo Hotel&rsquo;, kept by James Myles&mdash;known as &lsquo;Poisonous Jimmy&rsquo;,
    perhaps as a compliment to, or a libel on, the liquor he sold.) Job&rsquo;s
    brother Mac. was stationed at the Dead Dingo Hotel with instructions to hang
    round on some pretence, see that the doctor didn&rsquo;t either drink himself
    into the &lsquo;D.T.&rsquo;s&rsquo; or get sober enough to become restless;
    to prevent his going away, or to follow him if he did; and to bring him to
    the station in about a week&rsquo;s time. Mac. (rather more careless, brighter,
    and more energetic than his brother) was carrying out these instructions
    while pretending, with rather great success, to be himself on the spree at
    the shanty.</p>
  <p>But one morning, early in the specified week, Job&rsquo;s uneasiness was
    suddenly greatly increased by certain symptoms, so he sent the black boy
    for the neighbour&rsquo;s wife and decided to ride to Come-by-Chance to hurry
    out Gerty&rsquo;s mother, and see, by the way, how Doc. Wild and Mac. were
    getting on. On the arrival of the neighbour&rsquo;s wife, who drove over
    in a spring-cart, Job mounted his horse (a freshly broken filly) and started.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be anxious, Job,&rsquo; said Gerty, as he bent down to
    kiss her.  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll be all right. Wait! you&rsquo;d better take
    the gun&mdash; you might see those dingoes again. I&rsquo;ll get it for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The dingoes (native dogs) were very bad amongst the sheep; and Job and Gerty
    had started three together close to the track the last time they were out
    in company&mdash;without the gun, of course. Gerty took the loaded gun carefully
    down from its straps on the bedroom wall, carried it out, and handed it up
    to Job, who bent and kissed her again and then rode off.</p>
  <p>It was a hot day&mdash;the beginning of a long drought, as Job found to
    his bitter cost. He followed the track for five or six miles through the
    thick, monotonous scrub, and then turned off to make a short cut to the main
    road across a big ring-barked flat. The tall gum-trees had been ring-barked
    (a ring of bark taken out round the butts), or rather &lsquo;sapped&rsquo;&mdash;that
    is, a ring cut in through the sap &mdash;in order to kill them, so that the
    little strength in the  &lsquo;poor&rsquo; soil should not be drawn out by
    the living roots, and the natural grass (on which Australian stock depends)
    should have a better show. The hard, dead trees raised their barkless and
    whitened trunks and leafless branches for three or four miles, and the grey
    and brown grass stood tall between, dying in the first breaths of the coming
    drought. All was becoming grey and ashen here, the heat blazing and dancing
    across objects, and the pale brassy dome of the sky cloudless over all, the
    sun a glaring white disc with its edges almost melting into the sky. Job
    held his gun carelessly ready (it was a double-barrelled muzzle-loader, one
    barrel choke-bore for shot, and the other rifled), and he kept an eye out
    for dingoes. He was saving his horse for a long ride, jogging along in the
    careless Bush fashion, hitched a little to one side&mdash; and I&rsquo;m
    not sure that he didn&rsquo;t have a leg thrown up and across in front of
    the pommel of the saddle&mdash;he was riding along in the careless Bush fashion,
    and thinking fatherly thoughts in advance, perhaps, when suddenly a great
    black, greasy-looking iguana scuttled off from the side of the track amongst
    the dry tufts of grass and shreds of dead bark, and started up a sapling. &lsquo;It
    was a whopper,&rsquo; Job said afterwards; &lsquo;must have been over six
    feet, and a foot across the body. It scared me nearly as much as the filly.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The filly shied off like a rocket. Job kept his seat instinctively, as was
    natural to him; but before he could more than grab at the rein&mdash; lying
    loosely on the pommel&mdash;the filly &lsquo;fetched up&rsquo; against a
    dead box-tree, hard as cast-iron, and Job&rsquo;s left leg was jammed from
    stirrup to pocket. &lsquo;I felt the blood flare up,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
    I knowed that that&rsquo; &mdash;(Job swore now and then in an easy-going
    way)&mdash;&lsquo;I knowed that that blanky leg was broken alright. I threw
    the gun from me and freed my left foot from the stirrup with my hand, and
    managed to fall to the right, as the filly started off again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>What follows comes from the statements of Doc. Wild and Mac. Falconer, and
    Job&rsquo;s own &lsquo;wanderings in his mind&rsquo;, as he called them. &lsquo;They
    took a blanky mean advantage of me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when they had
    me down and I couldn&rsquo;t talk sense.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The filly circled off a bit, and then stood staring&mdash;as a mob of brumbies,
    when fired at, will sometimes stand watching the smoke. Job&rsquo;s leg was
    smashed badly, and the pain must have been terrible. But he thought then
    with a flash, as men do in a fix. No doubt the scene at the lonely Bush home
    of his boyhood started up before him: his father&rsquo;s horse appeared riderless,
    and he saw the look in his mother&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
  <p>Now a Bushman&rsquo;s first, best, and quickest chance in a fix like this
    is that his horse go home riderless, the home be alarmed, and the horse&rsquo;s
    tracks followed back to him; otherwise he might lie there for days, for weeks&mdash;till
    the growing grass buries his mouldering bones. Job was on an old sheep-track
    across a flat where few might have occasion to come for months, but he did
    not consider this. He crawled to his gun, then to a log, dragging gun and
    smashed leg after him. How he did it he doesn&rsquo;t know. Half-lying on
    one side, he rested the barrel on the log, took aim at the filly, pulled
    both triggers, and then fell over and lay with his head against the log;
    and the gun-barrel, sliding down, rested on his neck. He had fainted. The
    crows were interested, and the ants would come by-and-by.</p>
  <p>Now Doc. Wild had inspirations; anyway, he did things which seemed, after
    they were done, to have been suggested by inspiration and in no other possible
    way. He often turned up where and when he was wanted above all men, and at
    no other time. He had gipsy blood, they said; but, anyway, being the mystery
    he was, and having the face he had, and living the life he lived&mdash;and
    doing the things he did&mdash; it was quite probable that he was more nearly
    in touch than we with that awful invisible world all round and between us,
    of which we only see distorted faces and hear disjointed utterances when
    we are &lsquo;suffering a recovery&rsquo;&mdash;or going mad.</p>
  <p>On the morning of Job&rsquo;s accident, and after a long brooding silence,
    Doc. Wild suddenly said to Mac. Falconer&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Git the hosses, Mac. We&rsquo;ll go to the station.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mac., used to the doctor&rsquo;s eccentricities, went to see about the horses.</p>
  <p>And then who should drive up but Mrs Spencer&mdash;Job&rsquo;s mother-in-law&mdash;  on
    her way from the town to the station. She stayed to have a cup of tea and
    give her horses a feed. She was square-faced, and considered a rather hard
    and practical woman, but she had plenty of solid flesh, good sympathetic
    common-sense, and deep-set humorous blue eyes. She lived in the town comfortably
    on the interest of some money which her husband left in the bank. She drove
    an American waggonette with a good width and length of &lsquo;tray&rsquo; behind,
    and on this occasion she had a pole and two horses. In the trap were a new
    flock mattress and pillows, a generous pair of new white blankets, and boxes
    containing necessaries, delicacies, and luxuries. All round she was an excellent
    mother-in-law for a man to have on hand at a critical time.</p>
  <p>And, speaking of mother-in-law, I would like to put in a word for her right
    here. She is universally considered a nuisance in times of peace and comfort;
    but when illness or serious trouble comes home! Then it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Write
    to Mother! Wire for Mother! Send some one to fetch Mother! I&rsquo;ll go
    and bring Mother!&rsquo; and if she is not near: &lsquo;Oh, I wish Mother
    were here! If Mother were only near!&rsquo; And when she is on the spot,
    the anxious son-in-law: &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;go, Mother!
    You&rsquo;ll stay, won&rsquo;t you, Mother?&mdash;till we&rsquo;re all right?
    I&rsquo;ll get some one to look after your house, Mother, while you&rsquo;re
    here.&rsquo; But Job Falconer was fond of his mother-in-law, all times.</p>
  <p>Mac. had some trouble in finding and catching one of the horses. Mrs Spencer
    drove on, and Mac. and the doctor caught up to her about a mile before she
    reached the homestead track, which turned in through the scrubs at the corner
    of the big ring-barked flat.</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild and Mac. followed the cart-road, and as they jogged along in the
    edge of the scrub the doctor glanced once or twice across the flat through
    the dead, naked branches. Mac. looked that way. The crows were hopping about
    the branches of a tree way out in the middle of the flat, flopping down from
    branch to branch to the grass, then rising hurriedly and circling.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Dead beast there!&rsquo; said Mac. out of his Bushcraft.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No&mdash;dying,&rsquo; said Doc. Wild, with less Bush experience
    but more intellect.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There&rsquo;s some steers of Job&rsquo;s out there somewhere,&rsquo; muttered
    Mac. Then suddenly, &lsquo;It ain&rsquo;t drought&mdash;it&rsquo;s the ploorer
    at last! or I&rsquo;m blanked!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mac. feared the advent of that cattle-plague, pleuro-pneumonia, which was
    raging on some other stations, but had been hitherto kept clear of Job&rsquo;s
    run.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll go and see, if you like,&rsquo; suggested Doc. Wild.</p>
  <p>They turned out across the flat, the horses picking their way amongst the
    dried tufts and fallen branches.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Theer ain&rsquo;t no sign o&rsquo; cattle theer,&rsquo; said the
    doctor; &lsquo;more likely a ewe in trouble about her lamb.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, the blanky dingoes at the sheep,&rsquo; said Mac. &lsquo;I wish
    we had a gun&mdash; might get a shot at them.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild hitched the skirt of a long China silk coat he wore, free of a
    hip-pocket. He always carried a revolver. &lsquo;In case I feel obliged to
    shoot a first person singular one of these hot days,&rsquo; he explained
    once, whereat Bushmen scratched the backs of their heads and thought feebly,
    without result.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We&rsquo;d never git near enough for a shot,&rsquo; said the doctor;
    then he commenced to hum fragments from a Bush song about the finding of
    a lost Bushman in the last stages of death by thirst,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;&rdquo;The crows kept flyin&rsquo; up, boys!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crows kept flyin&rsquo; up!<br>
    The dog, he seen and whimpered, boys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he was but a pup.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;It must be something or other,&rsquo; muttered Mac. &lsquo;Look at
    them blanky crows!&rsquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;&rdquo;The lost was found, we brought him round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And took him from the place,<br>
    While the ants was swarmin&rsquo; on the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the crows was sayin&rsquo; grace!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;My God! what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; cried Mac., who was a little in
    advance and rode a tall horse.</p>
  <p>It was Job&rsquo;s filly, lying saddled and bridled, with a rifle-bullet
    (as they found on subsequent examination) through shoulders and chest, and
    her head full of kangaroo-shot. She was feebly rocking her head against the
    ground, and marking the dust with her hoof, as if trying to write the reason
    of it there.</p>
  <p>The doctor drew his revolver, took a cartridge from his waistcoat pocket,
    and put the filly out of her misery in a very scientific manner; then something&mdash;professional
    instinct or the something supernatural about the doctor&mdash;led him straight
    to the log, hidden in the grass, where Job lay as we left him, and about
    fifty yards from the dead filly, which must have staggered off some little
    way after being shot. Mac. followed the doctor, shaking violently.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, my God!&rsquo; he cried, with the woman in his voice&mdash;and
    his face so pale that his freckles stood out like buttons, as Doc. Wild said&mdash;&lsquo;oh,
    my God! he&rsquo;s shot himself!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;No, he hasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the doctor, deftly turning Job into
    a healthier position with his head from under the log and his mouth to the
    air: then he ran his eyes and hands over him, and Job moaned. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
    got a broken leg,&rsquo; said the doctor. Even then he couldn&rsquo;t resist
    making a characteristic remark, half to himself: &lsquo;A man doesn&rsquo;t
    shoot himself when he&rsquo;s going to be made a lawful father for the first
    time, unless he can see a long way into the future.&rsquo; Then he took out
    his whisky-flask and said briskly to Mac., &lsquo;Leave me your water-bag&rsquo; (Mac.
    carried a canvas water-bag slung under his horse&rsquo;s neck),  &lsquo;ride
    back to the track, stop Mrs Spencer, and bring the waggonette here. Tell
    her it&rsquo;s only a broken leg.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mac. mounted and rode off at a break-neck pace.</p>
  <p>As he worked the doctor muttered: &lsquo;He shot his horse. That&rsquo;s
    what gits me. The fool might have lain there for a week. I&rsquo;d never
    have suspected spite in that carcass, and I ought to know men.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But as Job came round a little Doc. Wild was enlightened.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the filly?&rsquo; cried Job suddenly between groans.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right,&rsquo; said the doctor.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop her!&rsquo; cried Job, struggling to rise&mdash;&lsquo;stop
    her!&mdash;oh God! my leg.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Keep quiet, you fool!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop her!&rsquo; yelled Job.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Why stop her?&rsquo; asked the doctor. &lsquo;She won&rsquo;t go
    fur,&rsquo; he added.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;She&rsquo;ll go home to Gerty,&rsquo; shouted Job. &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s
    sake stop her!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;O&mdash;h!&rsquo; drawled the doctor to himself. &lsquo;I might have
    guessed that. And I ought to know men.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t take me home!&rsquo; demanded Job in a semi-sensible
    interval.  &lsquo;Take me to Poisonous Jimmy&rsquo;s and tell Gerty I&rsquo;m
    on the spree.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>When Mac. and Mrs Spencer arrived with the waggonette Doc. Wild was in his
    shirt-sleeves, his Chinese silk coat having gone for bandages. The lower
    half of Job&rsquo;s trouser-leg and his &rsquo;lastic-side boot lay on the
    ground, neatly cut off, and his bandaged leg was sandwiched between two strips
    of bark, with grass stuffed in the hollows, and bound by saddle-straps.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all I kin do for him for the present.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Spencer was a strong woman mentally, but she arrived rather pale and
    a little shaky: nevertheless she called out, as soon as she got within earshot
    of the doctor&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s Job been doing now?&rsquo; (Job, by the way, had never
    been remarkable for doing anything.)</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s got his leg broke and shot his horse,&rsquo; replied the
    doctor.  &lsquo;But,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;whether he&rsquo;s been a hero
    or a fool I dunno. Anyway, it&rsquo;s a mess all round.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They unrolled the bed, blankets, and pillows in the bottom of the trap,
    backed it against the log, to have a step, and got Job in. It was a ticklish
    job, but they had to manage it: Job, maddened by pain and heat, only kept
    from fainting by whisky, groaning and raving and yelling to them to stop
    his horse.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Lucky we got him before the ants did,&rsquo; muttered the doctor.
    Then he had an inspiration&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;You bring him on to the shepherd&rsquo;s hut this side the station.
    We must leave him there. Drive carefully, and pour brandy into him now and
    then; when the brandy&rsquo;s done pour whisky, then gin&mdash;keep the rum
    till the last&rsquo; (the doctor had put a supply of spirits in the waggonette
    at Poisonous Jimmy&rsquo;s).  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take Mac.&rsquo;s horse and
    ride on and send Peter&rsquo; (the station hand) &lsquo;back to the hut to
    meet you. I&rsquo;ll be back myself if I can.&nbsp;<i>This business will
    hurry up things at the station</i>.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Which last was one of those apparently insane remarks of the doctor&rsquo;s
    which no sane nor sober man could fathom or see a reason for&mdash; except
    in Doc. Wild&rsquo;s madness.</p>
  <p>He rode off at a gallop. The burden of Job&rsquo;s raving, all the way,
    rested on the dead filly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Stop her! She must not go home to Gerty! . . . God help me shoot!
    . . . Whoa!&mdash;whoa, there! . . . &ldquo;Cope&mdash;cope&mdash;cope&rdquo;&mdash;Steady,
    Jessie, old girl. . . . Aim straight&mdash;aim straight! Aim for me, God!&mdash; I&rsquo;ve
    missed! . . . Stop her!&rsquo;  &amp;c.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I never met a character like that,&rsquo; commented the doctor afterwards, &lsquo;inside
    a man that looked like Job on the outside. I&rsquo;ve met men behind revolvers
    and big mustarshes in Califo&rsquo;nia; but I&rsquo;ve met a derned sight
    more men behind nothing but a good-natured grin, here in Australia. These
    lanky sawney Bushmen will do things in an easy-going way some day that&rsquo;ll
    make the old world sit up and think hard.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He reached the station in time, and twenty minutes or half an hour later
    he left the case in the hands of the Lancashire woman&mdash; whom he saw
    reason to admire&mdash;and rode back to the hut to help Job, whom they soon
    fixed up as comfortably as possible.</p>
  <p>They humbugged Mrs Falconer first with a yarn of Job&rsquo;s alleged phenomenal
    shyness, and gradually, as she grew stronger, and the truth less important,
    they told it to her. And so, instead of Job being pushed, scarlet-faced,
    into the bedroom to see his first-born, Gerty Falconer herself took the child
    down to the hut, and so presented Uncle Job with my first and favourite cousin
    and Bush chum.</p>
  <p>Doc. Wild stayed round until he saw Job comfortably moved to the homestead,
    then he prepared to depart.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rsquo; said Job, who was still weak&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    sorry for that there filly. I was breaking her in to side-saddle for Gerty
    when she should get about. I wouldn&rsquo;t have lost her for twenty quid.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Never mind, Job,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;I, too, once shot
    an animal I was fond of&mdash;and for the sake of a woman&mdash;but that
    animal walked on two legs and wore trousers. Good-bye, Job.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And he left for Poisonous Jimmy&rsquo;s.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLittleWorldLeftBehind"></a>The Little World
      Left Behind</b></h2>
  <p>I&nbsp;lately revisited a western agricultural district in Australia after
    many years. The railway had reached it, but otherwise things were drearily,
    hopelessly, depressingly unchanged. There was the same old grant, comprising
    several thousands of acres of the richest land in the district, lying idle
    still, except for a few horses allowed to run there for a shilling a-head
    per week.</p>
  <p>There were the same old selections&mdash;about as far off as ever from becoming
    freeholds&mdash;shoved back among the barren ridges; dusty little patches
    in the scrub, full of stones and stumps, and called farms, deserted every
    few years, and tackled again by some little dried-up family, or some old
    hatter, and then given best once more. There was the cluster of farms on
    the flat, and in the foot of the gully, owned by Australians of Irish or
    English descent, with the same number of stumps in the wheat-paddock, the
    same broken fences and tumble-down huts and yards, and the same weak, sleepy
    attempt made every season to scratch up the ground and raise a crop. And
    along the creek the German farmers&mdash; the only people there worthy of
    the name&mdash;toiling (men, women, and children) from daylight till dark,
    like slaves, just as they always had done; the elder sons stoop-shouldered
    old men at thirty.</p>
  <p>The row about the boundary fence between the Sweeneys and the Joneses was
    unfinished still, and the old feud between the Dunderblitzens and the Blitzendunders
    was more deadly than ever&mdash;it started three generations ago over a stray
    bull. The O&rsquo;Dunn was still fighting for his great object in life, which
    was not to be &lsquo;onneighborly&rsquo;, as he put it. &lsquo;I <i>don&rsquo;t</i> want
    to be onneighborly,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;ll be aven wid some
    of &rsquo;em yit. It&rsquo;s almost impossible for a dacent man to live in
    sich a neighborhood and not be onneighborly, thry how he will. But I&rsquo;ll
    be aven wid some of &rsquo;em yit, marruk my wurrud.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Jones&rsquo;s red steer&mdash;it couldn&rsquo;t have been the same red steer&mdash; was
    continually breaking into Rooney&rsquo;s &lsquo;whate an&rsquo; bringin&rsquo; ivery
    head av the other cattle afther him, and ruinin&rsquo; him intirely.&rsquo; The
    Rooneys and M&lsquo;Kenzies were at daggers drawn, even to the youngest child,
    over the impounding of a horse belonging to Pat Rooney&rsquo;s brother-in-law,
    by a distant relation of the M&lsquo;Kenzies, which had happened nine years
    ago.</p>
  <p>The same sun-burned, masculine women went past to market twice a-week in
    the same old carts and driving much the same quality of carrion. The string
    of overloaded spring-carts, buggies, and sweating horses went whirling into
    town, to &lsquo;service&rsquo;, through clouds of dust and broiling heat,
    on Sunday morning, and came driving cruelly out again at noon. The neighbours&rsquo; sons
    rode over in the afternoon, as of old, and hung up their poor, ill-used little
    horses to bake in the sun, and sat on their heels about the verandah, and
    drawled drearily concerning crops, fruit, trees, and vines, and horses and
    cattle; the drought and &lsquo;smut&rsquo; and &lsquo;rust&rsquo; in wheat,
    and the &lsquo;ploorer&rsquo;  (pleuro-pneumonia) in cattle, and other cheerful
    things; that there colt or filly, or that there cattle-dog (pup or bitch)
    o&rsquo; mine (or &lsquo;Jim&rsquo;s&rsquo;). They always talked most of
    farming there, where no farming worthy of the name was possible&mdash;except
    by Germans and Chinamen. Towards evening the old local relic of the golden
    days dropped in and announced that he intended to &lsquo;put down a shaft&rsquo;  next
    week, in a spot where he&rsquo;d been going to put it down twenty years ago&mdash;and
    every week since. It was nearly time that somebody sunk a hole and buried
    him there.</p>
  <p>An old local body named Mrs Witherly still went into town twice a-week with
    her &lsquo;bit av prodjuce&rsquo;, as O&rsquo;Dunn called it. She still drove
    a long, bony, blind horse in a long rickety dray, with a stout sapling for
    a whip, and about twenty yards of clothes-line reins. The floor of the dray
    covered part of an acre, and one wheel was always ahead of the other&mdash;or
    behind, according to which shaft was pulled. She wore, to all appearances,
    the same short frock, faded shawl, men&rsquo;s &rsquo;lastic sides, and white
    hood that she had on when the world was made. She still stopped just twenty
    minutes at old Mrs Leatherly&rsquo;s on the way in for a yarn and a cup of
    tea&mdash;as she had always done, on the same days and at the same time within
    the memory of the hoariest local liar. However, she had a new clothes-line
    bent on to the old horse&rsquo;s front end&mdash; and we fancy that was the
    reason she didn&rsquo;t recognise us at first. She had never looked younger
    than a hard hundred within the memory of man. Her shrivelled face was the
    colour of leather, and crossed and recrossed with lines till there wasn&rsquo;t
    room for any more. But her eyes were bright yet, and twinkled with humour
    at times.</p>
  <p>She had been in the Bush for fifty years, and had fought fires, droughts,
    hunger and thirst, floods, cattle and crop diseases, and all the things that
    God curses Australian settlers with. She had had two husbands, and it could
    be said of neither that he had ever done an honest day&rsquo;s work, or any
    good for himself or any one else. She had reared something under fifteen
    children, her own and others; and there was scarcely one of them that had
    not given her trouble. Her sons had brought disgrace on her old head over
    and over again, but she held up that same old head through it all, and looked
    her narrow, ignorant world in the face&mdash;and &lsquo;lived it down&rsquo;.
    She had worked like a slave for fifty years; yet she had more energy and
    endurance than many modern city women in her shrivelled old body. She was
    a daughter of English aristocrats.</p>
  <p>And we who live our weak lives of fifty years or so in the cities&mdash;  we
    grow maudlin over our sorrows (and beer), and ask whether life is worth living
    or not.</p>
  <p>I sought in the farming town relief from the general and particular sameness
    of things, but there was none. The railway station was about the only new
    building in town. The old signs even were as badly in need of retouching
    as of old. I picked up a copy of the local&nbsp;<i>Advertiser</i>, which
    newspaper had been started in the early days by a brilliant drunkard, who
    drank himself to death just as the fathers of our nation were beginning to
    get educated up to his style. He might have made Australian journalism very
    different from what it is. There was nothing new in the&nbsp;<i>Advertiser</i>&mdash;there
    had been nothing new since the last time the drunkard had been sober enough
    to hold a pen. There was the same old &lsquo;enjoyable trip&rsquo; to Drybone
    (whereof the editor was the hero), and something about an on-the-whole very
    enjoyable evening in some place that was tastefully decorated, and where
    the visitors did justice to the good things provided, and the small hours,
    and dancing, and our host and hostess, and respected fellow-townsmen; also
    divers young ladies sang very nicely, and a young Mr Somebody favoured the
    company with a comic song.</p>
  <p>There was the same trespassing on the valuable space by the old subscriber,
    who said that &lsquo;he had said before and would say again&rsquo;, and he
    proceeded to say the same things which he said in the same paper when we
    first heard our father reading it to our mother. Farther on the old subscriber
    proceeded to &lsquo;maintain&rsquo;, and recalled attention to the fact that
    it was just exactly as he had said. After which he made a few abstract, incoherent
    remarks about the &lsquo;surrounding district&rsquo;, and concluded by stating
    that he &lsquo;must now conclude&rsquo;, and thanking the editor for trespassing
    on the aforesaid valuable space.</p>
  <p>There was the usual leader on the Government; and an agitation was still
    carried on, by means of horribly-constructed correspondence to both papers,
    for a bridge over Dry-Hole Creek at Dustbin&mdash; a place where no sane
    man ever had occasion to go.</p>
  <p>I took up the &lsquo;unreliable contemporary&rsquo;, but found nothing there
    except a letter from &lsquo;Parent&rsquo;, another from &lsquo;Ratepayer&rsquo;,
    a leader on the Government, and &lsquo;A Trip to Limeburn&rsquo;, which latter
    I suppose was made in opposition to the trip to Drybone.</p>
  <p>There was nothing new in the town. Even the almost inevitable gang of city
    spoilers hadn&rsquo;t arrived with the railway. They would have been a relief.
    There was the monotonous aldermanic row, and the worse than hopeless little
    herd of aldermen, the weird agricultural portion of whom came in on council
    days in white starched and ironed coats, as we had always remembered them.
    They were aggressively barren of ideas; but on this occasion they had risen
    above themselves, for one of them had remembered something his grandfather
    (old time English alderman) had told him, and they were stirring up all the
    old local quarrels and family spite of the district over a motion, or an
    amendment on a motion, that a letter&mdash;from another enlightened body
    and bearing on an equally important matter (which letter had been sent through
    the post sufficiently stamped, delivered to the secretary, handed to the
    chairman, read aloud in council, and passed round several times for private
    perusal)&mdash;over a motion that such letter be received.</p>
  <p>There was a maintenance case coming on&mdash;to the usual well-ventilated
    disgust of the local religious crank, who was on the jury; but the case differed
    in no essential point from other cases which were always coming on and going
    off in my time. It was not at all romantic. The local youth was not even
    brilliant in adultery.</p>
  <p>After I had been a week in that town the Governor decided to visit it, and
    preparations were made to welcome him and present him with an address. Then
    I thought that it was time to go, and slipped away unnoticed in the general
    lunacy.</p>

  <h1 align="center"><b>The Romance of the Swag </b></h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRomanceoftheSwag"></a>The Romance of the
      Swag</b></h2>
  <p>The&nbsp;Australian swag fashion is the easiest way in the world of carrying
    a load. I ought to know something about carrying loads: I&rsquo;ve carried
    babies, which are the heaviest and most awkward and heartbreaking loads in
    this world for a boy or man to carry, I fancy. God remember mothers who slave
    about the housework (and do sometimes a man&rsquo;s work in addition in the
    bush) with a heavy, squalling kid on one arm! I&rsquo;ve humped logs on the
    selection,  &ldquo;burning-off,&rdquo; with loads of fencing-posts and rails
    and palings out of steep, rugged gullies (and was happier then, perhaps);
    I&rsquo;ve carried a shovel, crowbar, heavy &ldquo;rammer,&rdquo; a dozen
    insulators on an average (strung round my shoulders with raw flax)&mdash;to
    say nothing of soldiering kit, tucker-bag, billy and climbing spurs&mdash;all
    day on a telegraph line in rough country in New Zealand, and in places where
    a man had to manage his load with one hand and help himself climb with the
    other; and I&rsquo;ve helped hump and drag telegraph-poles up cliffs and
    sidings where the horses couldn&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;ve carried a portmanteau
    on the hot dusty roads in green old jackeroo days. Ask any actor who&rsquo;s
    been stranded and had to count railway sleepers from one town to another!
    he&rsquo;ll tell you what sort of an awkward load a portmanteau is, especially
    if there&rsquo;s a broken-hearted man underneath it. I&rsquo;ve tried knapsack
    fashion&mdash;one of the least healthy and most likely to give a man sores;
    I&rsquo;ve carried my belongings in a three-bushel sack slung over my shoulder&mdash;blankets,
    tucker, spare boots and poetry all lumped together. I tried carrying a load
    on my head, and got a crick in my neck and spine for days. I&rsquo;ve carried
    a load on my mind that should have been shared by editors and publishers.
    I&rsquo;ve helped hump luggage and furniture up to, and down from, a top
    flat in London. And I&rsquo;ve carried swag for months out back in Australia&mdash;and
    it was life, in spite of its &ldquo;squalidness&rdquo; and meanness and wretchedness
    and hardship, and in spite of the fact that the world would have regarded
    us as &ldquo;tramps&rdquo;&mdash;and a free life amongst&nbsp;<i>men</i>&nbsp;from
    all the world</p>
  <p>The Australian swag was born of Australia and no other land&mdash;of the
    Great Lone Land of magnificent distances and bright heat; the land of self-reliance,
    and never-give-in, and help-your-mate. The grave of many of the world&rsquo;s
    tragedies and comedies&mdash;royal and otherwise. The land where a man out
    of employment might shoulder his swag in Adelaide and take the track, and
    years later walk into a hut on the Gulf, or never be heard of any more, or
    a body be found in the bush and buried by the mounted police, or never found
    and never buried&mdash;what does it matter?</p>
  <p>The land I love above all others&mdash;not because it was kind to me, but
    because I was born on Australian soil, and because of the foreign father
    who died at his work in the ranks of Australian pioneers, and because of
    many things. Australia! My country! Her very name is music to me. God bless
    Australia! for the sake of the great hearts of the heart of her! God keep
    her clear of the old-world shams and social lies and mockery, and callous
    commercialism, and sordid shame! And heaven send that, if ever in my time
    her sons are called upon to fight for her young life and honour, I die with
    the first rank of them and be buried in Australian ground.</p>
  <p>But this will probably be called false, forced or &ldquo;maudlin sentiment&rdquo; here
    in England, where the mawkish sentiment of the music-halls, and the popular
    applause it receives, is enough to make a healthy man sick, and is only equalled
    by music-hall vulgarity. So I&rsquo;ll get on.</p>
  <p>In the old digging days the knapsack, or straps-across-the chest fashion,
    was tried, but the load pressed on a man&rsquo;s chest and impeded his breathing,
    and a man needs to have his bellows free on long tracks in hot, stirless
    weather. Then the &ldquo;horse-collar,&rdquo; or rolled military overcoat
    style&mdash;swag over one shoulder and under the other arm&mdash;was tried,
    but it was found to be too hot for the Australian climate, and was discarded
    along with Wellington boots and leggings. Until recently, Australian city
    artists and editors&mdash;who knew as much about the bush as Downing Street
    knows about the British colonies in general&mdash;seemed to think the horse-collar
    swag was still in existence; and some artists gave the swagman a stick, as
    if he were a tramp of civilization with an eye on the backyard and a fear
    of the dog. English artists, by the way, seem firmly convinced that the Australian
    bushman is born in Wellington boots with a polish on &rsquo;em you could
    shave yourself by.</p>
  <p>The swag is usually composed of a tent  &ldquo;fly&rdquo; or strip of calico
    (a cover for the swag and a shelter in bad weather&mdash;in New Zealand it
    is oilcloth or waterproof twill), a couple of blankets, blue by custom and
    preference, as that colour shows the dirt less than any other (hence the
    name &ldquo;bluey&rdquo; for swag), and the core is composed of spare clothing
    and small personal effects. To make or &ldquo;roll up&rdquo; your swag: lay
    the fly or strip of calico on the ground, blueys on top of it; across one
    end, with eighteen inches or so to spare, lay your spare trousers and shirt,
    folded, light boots tied together by the laces toe to heel, books, bundle
    of old letters, portraits, or whatever little knick-knacks you have or care
    to carry, bag of needles, thread, pen and ink, spare patches for your pants,
    and bootlaces. Lay or arrange the pile so that it will roll evenly with the
    swag (some pack the lot in an old pillowslip or canvas bag), take a fold
    over of blanket and calico the whole length on each side, so as to reduce
    the width of the swag to, say, three feet, throw the spare end, with an inward
    fold, over the little pile of belongings, and then roll the whole to the
    other end, using your knees and judgment to make the swag tight, compact
    and artistic; when within eighteen inches of the loose end take an inward
    fold in that, and bring it up against the body of the swag. There is a strong
    suggestion of a roley-poley in a rag about the business, only the ends of
    the swag are folded in, in rings, and not tied. Fasten the swag with three
    or four straps, according to judgment and the supply of straps. To the top
    strap, for the swag is carried (and eased down in shanty bars and against
    walls or veranda-posts when not on the track) in a more or less vertical
    position&mdash;to the top strap, and lowest, or lowest but one, fasten the
    ends of the shoulder strap (usually a towel is preferred as being softer
    to the shoulder), your coat being carried outside the swag at the back, under
    the straps. To the top strap fasten the string of the nose-bag, a calico
    bag about the size of a pillowslip, containing the tea, sugar and flour bags,
    bread, meat, baking-powder and salt, and brought, when the swag is carried
    from the left shoulder, over the right on to the chest, and so balancing
    the swag behind. But a swagman can throw a heavy swag in a nearly vertical
    position against his spine, slung from one shoulder only and without any
    balance, and carry it as easily as you might wear your overcoat. Some bushmen
    arrange their belongings so neatly and conveniently, with swag straps in
    a sort of harness, that they can roll up the swag in about a minute, and
    unbuckle it and throw it out as easily as a roll of wall-paper, and there&rsquo;s
    the bed ready on the ground with the wardrobe for a pillow. The swag is always
    used for a seat on the track; it is a soft seat, so trousers last a long
    time. And, the dust being mostly soft and silky on the long tracks out back,
    boots last marvellously. Fifteen miles a day is the average with the swag,
    but you must travel according to the water: if the next bore or tank is five
    miles on, and the next twenty beyond, you camp at the five-mile water to-night
    and do the twenty next day. But if it&rsquo;s thirty miles you have to do
    it. Travelling with the swag in Australia is variously and picturesquely
    described as &ldquo;humping bluey,&rdquo; &ldquo;walking Matilda,&rdquo; &ldquo;humping
    Matilda,&rdquo; &ldquo;humping your drum,&rdquo; &ldquo;being on the wallaby,&rdquo;  &ldquo;jabbing
    trotters,&rdquo; and &ldquo;tea and sugar burglaring,&rdquo; but most travelling
    shearers now call themselves trav&rsquo;lers, and say simply &ldquo;on the
    track,&rdquo; or  &ldquo;carrying swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And there you have the Australian swag. Men from all the world have carried
    it<i>&mdash;</i>lords and low-class Chinamen, saints and world martyrs, and
    felons, thieves, and murderers, educated gentlemen and boors who couldn&rsquo;t
    sign their mark, gentlemen who fought for Poland and convicts who fought
    the world, women, and more than one woman disguised as a man. The Australian
    swag has held in its core letters and papers in all languages, the honour
    of great houses, and more than one national secret, papers that would send
    well-known and highly-respected men to jail, and proofs of the innocence
    of men going mad in prisons, life tragedies and comedies, fortunes and papers
    that secured titles and fortunes, and the last pence of lost fortunes, life
    secrets, portraits of mothers and dead loves, pictures of fair women, heart-breaking
    old letters written long ago by vanished hands, and the pencilled manuscript
    of more than one book which will be famous yet.</p>
  <p>The weight of the swag varies from the light rouseabout&rsquo;s swag, containing
    one blanket and a clean shirt, to the  &ldquo;royal Alfred,&rdquo; with tent
    and all complete, and weighing part of a ton. Some old sundowners have a
    mania for gathering, from selectors&rsquo; and shearers&rsquo; huts, and
    dust-heaps, heart-breaking loads of rubbish which can never be of any possible
    use to them or anyone else. Here is an inventory of the contents of the swag
    of an old tramp who was found dead on the track, lying on his face on the
    sand, with his swag on top of him, and his arms stretched straight out as
    if he were embracing the mother earth, or had made, with his last movement,
    the sign of the cross to the blazing heavens</p>
  <p>Rotten old tent in rags. Filthy blue blanket, patched with squares of red
    and calico. Half of &ldquo;white blanket&rdquo; nearly black now, patched
    with pieces of various material and sewn to half of red blanket. Three-bushel
    sack slit open. Pieces of sacking. Part of a woman&rsquo;s skirt. Two rotten
    old pairs of moleskin trousers. One leg of a pair of trousers. Back of a
    shirt. Half a waistcoat. Two tweed coats, green, old and rotting, and patched
    with calico. Blanket, etc. Large bundle of assorted rags for patches, all
    rotten. Leaky billy-can, containing fishingline, papers, suet, needles and
    cotton, etc. Jam-tin, medicine bottles, corks on strings, to hang to his
    hat to keep the flies off (a sign of madness in the bush, for the corks would
    madden a sane man sooner than the flies could). Three boots of different
    sizes, all belonging to the right foot, and a left slipper. Coffeepot, without
    handle or spout, and quart-pot full of rubbish&mdash;broken knives and forks,
    with the handles burnt off, spoons, etc., picked up on rubbish-heaps; and
    many rusty nails, to be used as buttons, I suppose.</p>
  <p>Broken saw blade, hammer, broken crockery, old pannikins, small rusty frying-pan
    without a handle, children&rsquo;s old shoes, many bits of old bootleather
    and greenhide, part of yellowback novel, mutilated English dictionary, grammar
    and arithmetic book, a ready reckoner, a cookery book, a bulgy angloforeign
    dictionary, part of a Shakespeare, book in French and book in German, and
    a book on etiquette and courtship. A heavy pair of blucher boots, with uppers
    parched and cracked, and soles so patched (patch over patch) with leather,
    boot protectors, hoop-iron and hobnails that they were about two inches thick,
    and the boots weighed over five pounds. (If you don&rsquo;t believe me go
    into the Melbourne Museum, where, in a glass case in a place of honour, you
    will see a similar, perhaps the same, pair of bluchers labelled &ldquo;An
    example of colonial industry.&rdquo;) And in the core of the swag was a sugar-bag
    tied tightly with a whip-lash, and containing another old skirt, rolled very
    tight and fastened with many turns of a length of clothes-line, which last,
    I suppose, he carried to hang himself with if he felt that way. The skirt
    was rolled round a small packet of old portraits and almost indecipherable
    letters&mdash;one from a woman who had evidently been a sensible woman and
    a widow, and who stated in the letter that she did not intend to get married
    again as she had enough to do already, slavin&rsquo; her finger-nails off
    to keep a family, without having a second husband to keep. And her answer
    was &ldquo;final for good and all,&rdquo; and it wasn&rsquo;t no use comin&rsquo; &ldquo;bungfoodlin&rsquo;&rdquo; round
    her again. If he did she&rsquo;d set Satan on to him. &ldquo;Satan&rdquo; was
    a dog, I suppose.</p>
  <p>The letter was addressed to &ldquo;Dear Bill,&rdquo;  as were others. There
    were no envelopes. The letters were addressed from no place in particular,
    so there weren&rsquo;t any means of identifying the dead man. The police
    buried him under a gum, and a young trooper cut on the tree the words:</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">An Australian Story </p>
  <h3 align="center">PROLOGUE</h3>
  <p>Old&nbsp;Abel Albury had a genius for getting the bull by the tail with
    a tight grip, and holding on with both hands and an obstinacy born of ignorance&mdash;and
    not necessarily for the sake of selfpreservation or selfishness&mdash;while
    all the time the bull might be, so to speak, rooting up life-long friendships
    and neighbourly relations, and upsetting domestic customs and traditions
    with his horns.</p>
  <p>Yes, Uncle Abel was always grasping the wrong end of things, and sticking
    to it with that human mulishness which is often stronger, and more often
    wearies and breaks down the opposition than an intelligent man&rsquo;s arguments.
    He was&mdash;or professed to be, the family said&mdash;unable for a long
    time to distinguish between his two grand-nephews, one of whom was short
    and fat, while the other was tall and thin, the only points of resemblance
    between them being that each possessed the old family nose and eyes. When
    they were boys he used to lay the strap about one in mistake for the other.
    They had a saying that Uncle Abel saw with ten squinting eyes.</p>
  <p>Also, he could never&mdash;or would not, as the family said&mdash;remember
    names. He referred to Mrs Porter, a thin, haggard selector&rsquo;s wife,
    as &ldquo;Mrs Stout&rdquo; and he balanced matters by calling Mrs Southwick &ldquo;Mrs
    Porterwicket&rdquo;&mdash;when he didn&rsquo;t address her as &ldquo;Mrs
    What&rsquo;s-the-woman&rsquo;s-name&rdquo;&mdash;and he succeeded in deeply
    offending both ladies.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel was Mrs Carey&rsquo;s uncle. Down at the lower end of Carey&rsquo;s
    selection at Rocky Rises, in the extreme corner of the lower or outer paddock,
    were sliprails opening into the main road, which ran down along the siding,
    round the foot of a spur from ridge, and out west. These sliprails were called &ldquo;The
    Lower Sliprails&rdquo; by the family, and it occurred to Uncle Abel to refer
    to them as &ldquo;Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,&rdquo; for no other reason apparently
    than that Buckolts&rsquo; farm lay in that direction. The farm was about
    a mile further on, on the other side of the creek, and the gate leading to
    it from the main road was round the spur, out of sight of Carey&rsquo;s selection.
    It is quite possible that Uncle Abel reasoned the thing out for days, for
    of such material are some human brains. Sliprails, or a slip-panel, is a
    panel of fencing of which the rails are made to be slipped out of the mortise
    holes in the posts so as to give passage to horses, vehicles and cattle.
    I suppose Abel called it a gate, because he was always going to hang a proper
    gate there some day. The family were unaware of his new name for the Lower
    Sliprails, and after he had, on one or two occasions, informed the boys that
    they would find a missing cow or horse at the Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, and they
    had found it calmly camped at the Lower Sliprails, and after he had made
    several appointments to meet parties at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, and had been
    found leaning obstinately on the fence by the Lower Sliprails with no explanation
    to offer other than that he was waiting at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate, they began
    to fear that he was becoming weak in his mind.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;I</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was New Year&rsquo;s Eve at Rocky Rises. There was no need for fireworks
    nor bonfires, for the bush-fires were out all along the ranges to the east,
    and, as night came on, lines and curves of lights&mdash;clear lights, white
    lights, and, in the nearer distance, red lights and smoky lights-marked the
    sidings and ridges of a western spur of the Blue Mountain Range, and seemed
    suspended against a dark sky, for the stars and the loom of the hills were
    hidden by smoke and drought haze.</p>
  <p>There was a dance at Careys&rsquo;. Old Carey was a cheerful, broad-minded
    bushman, haunted at times by the memories of old days, when he was the beau
    of the bush balls, and so when he built his new slab-and-bark barn he had
    it properly floored with hard-wood, and the floor well-faced &ldquo;to give
    the young people a show when they wanted a dance,&rdquo; he said. The floor
    had a spring in it, and bush boys and girls often rode twenty miles and more
    to dance on that floor. The girls said it was a lovely floor.</p>
  <p>On this occasion Carey had stacked his wheat outside until after the New
    Year. Spring-carts, and men and girls on horseback came in from miles round. &ldquo;Sperm&rdquo; candles
    had been cut up and thrown on the floor during the afternoon, and rubbed
    over by feet eased tightly in  &rsquo;lastic-sides; and hoops were hung horizontally
    from the tie-beams, with candles stuck round them. There were fresh-faced
    girls, and sweet, freckled-faced girls, and jolly girls, and shy girls&mdash;all
    sorts of girls except sulky, &ldquo;toney&rdquo; girls&mdash;and lanky chaps,
    most of them sawney, and weird, whiskered agriculturists, who watched the
    dancers with old, old time-worn smiles, or stood, or sat on their heels yarning,
    with their pipes, outside, where two boilers were slung over a log-fire to
    boil water for tea; and there were leathery women, with complexions like
    dried apples, who gossiped&mdash;for the first time in months perhaps&mdash;and
    watched the young people, and thought at times, no doubt, of other days&mdash;of
    other days when they were girls. (And not so far distant either, in some
    cases, for women dry quickly in the bush.)</p>
  <p>And there were one or two old soldiers and their wives, whose eyes glistened
    when Jim Bullock played &ldquo;The Girl I Left Behind Me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock was there with his concertina. He sat on a stool in front of
    a bench, on which was a beer-keg, piles of teacups and saucers, several big
    tin teapots, and plates of sandwiches, sponge-cakes, and tarts. Jim sat in
    his shirt-sleeves, with his flat-brimmed, wire-bound, &ldquo;hard-hitter&rdquo; hat
    on, slanting over his weaker eye. He held one leg loosely and the other rigid,
    with the concertina on his knee, and swanked away at the instrument by the
    hour, staring straight in front of him with the expression of a cod-fish,
    and never moving a muscle except the muscles of his great hairy arms and
    big chapped and sunblotched hands; while chaps in tight  &ldquo;larstins&rdquo; (elastic-side
    boots), slop suits of black, bound with braid, and with coats too short in
    the neck and arms, and trousers bell-mouthed at the bottoms, and some with
    paper collars, narrow red ribbon ties, or scarfs through walnut shells, held
    their partners rigidly, and went round the room with their eyes&mdash;most
    of them&mdash;cocked at the rafters in semi-idiotic ecstasy.</p>
  <p>But there was tall, graceful, pink-and-white Bertha Buckolt, blue-eyed and
    blue-black-haired, and little Mary Carey with the kind, grey eyes and red-gold
    hair; there was Mary&rsquo;s wild brother Jim, with curly black hair and
    blue eyes and dimples of innocence; and there was Harry Dale, the drover,
    Jim&rsquo;s shearing and droving mate, a tall, good-looking, brown-eyed and
    brown-haired young fellow, a &ldquo;better-class&rdquo;  bushman and the
    best dancer in the district. Uncle Abel usurped the position of M.C., and
    roared &ldquo;Now then! take yer partners!&rdquo; and bawled instructions
    and interrupted and tangled up the dancers, until they got used to taking
    no notice of his bull voice. Mary Carey was too shy&mdash;because she loved
    him, and secretly and fondly hoped and doubted that he cared for her&mdash;to
    be seen dancing more than once with Harry Dale, so he shared Bertha Buckolt,
    the best girl dancer there, with Jim Carey, who danced with his sister when
    Harry was dancing with Bertha Buckolt, and who seemed, for some reason best
    known to himself, to be perfectly satisfied with the arrangement. Poor little
    Mary began to fret presently, and feel a little jealous of Bertha, her old
    schoolmate. She was little and couldn&rsquo;t dance like Bertha, and she
    couldn&rsquo;t help noticing how well Bertha looked to-night, and what a
    well-matched pair she and Harry made; and so, when twelve o&rsquo;clock came
    and they all went outside to watch the Old Year out and the New Year in&mdash;with
    a big bonfire on the distant ridge where the grass fires had reached a stretch
    of dry scrub&mdash;and to join hands all round and sing &ldquo;Auld Lang
    Syne,&rdquo; little Mary was not to be found, for she was sitting on a log
    round behind the cow-yard, crying softly to herself.</p>
  <p>And when about three o&rsquo;clock they all started home, Mary gave Bertha
    her check to kiss instead of her mouth, and that hurt Bertha, who had&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;cry
    riding home, to the astonishment and irritation of her brother Jack, who
    rode home with her.</p>
  <p>But when they were all gone Mary was missing again and when her mother called
    her, and, after a pause, the voice of Harry Dale said, respectfully, in the
    darkness, &ldquo;She&rsquo;s here, Mrs Carey, she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; the
    two were discovered sitting on a convenient log of the wood-heap, with an
    awkward and overacted interval of log between them.</p>
  <p>Old Carey liked Harry Dale, and seemed very well satisfied with the way
    things appeared to be going. He pressed Harry to stay at the selection overnight. &ldquo;The
    missus will make you a shake-down on the floor,&rdquo; he said. Harry had
    no appointments, and stayed cheerfully, and old Carey, having had a whisky
    or two, insisted on Mary making the shake-down, and the old folks winked
    at each other behind the young folks&rsquo; backs to see how poor little
    Mary spread a spare mattress, with redhot, averted face, and found an extra
    pillow and a spare pair of ironed sheets for the shake-down.</p>
  <p>At sunrise she stole out to milk the cows, which was her regular duty; there
    was no other way out from her room than through the dining-room, where Harry
    lay on his back, with his arms folded, resting peacefully. He seemed sound
    asleep and safe for a good two hours, so she ventured. As she passed out
    she paused a moment looking down on him with all the lovelight in her eyes,
    and, obeying a sudden impulse, she stooped softly and touched his forehead
    with her lips, then she slipped out. Harry stretched, opened his eyes, winked
    solemnly at the ceiling, and then, after a decent interval, he got up, dressed,
    and went out to help her to milk.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Harry Dale and Jim Carey were going out to take charge of a mob of bullocks
    going north-west, away up in Queensland, and as they had lost a day and night
    to be at the dance, they decided to start in the cool of the evening and
    travel all night. Mary walked from the homestead to the Lower Sliprails between
    her brother, who rode&mdash;because he was her brother&mdash;and led a packhorse
    on the other side, and Harry, who walked and led his horse&mdash;because
    he was her sweetheart, avowed only since last night.</p>
  <p>There were thunderstorms about, and Mary had repented sufficiently with
    regard to Bertha Buckolt to wear on her shoulders a cape which Bertha had
    left behind her last night.</p>
  <p>When they reached the Lower Sliprails Jim said he&rsquo;d go on and that
    Harry needn&rsquo;t hurry: he stooped over his horse&rsquo;s neck, kissed
    his sister, promised to keep away from the drink, not to touch a card, and
    to leave off fighting, and rode on. And when he rounded the Spur he saw a
    tall, graceful figure slipping through the trees from the creek towards Buckolts&rsquo; Gate.</p>
  <p>Then came the critical time at the Lower Sliprails. The shadows from the
    setting sun lengthened quickly on the siding, and then the sun slipped out
    of sight over a &ldquo;saddle&rdquo; in the ridges, and all was soon dusk
    save the sunlit peaks of the Blue Mountains away to the east over the sweeps
    of blue-grey bush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well! Mary,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I must make a start now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll&mdash;you&rsquo;ll look after Jim, won&rsquo;t you,
    Harry?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will, Mary, for your sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Her mouth began to twitch, her chin to tremble, and her eyes brimmed suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You must cheer up, Mary,&rdquo; he said with her in his arms. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    be back before you know where you are, and then we&rsquo;ll be married right
    off at once and settle down for life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She smiled bravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Harry!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He led his horse through the rails and lifted them, with trembling hands,
    and shot them home. Another kiss across the top rail and he got on his horse.
    She mounted the lower rail, and he brought his horse close alongside the
    fence and stooped to kiss her again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cheer up, Mary!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll
    do&mdash;when I come back I&rsquo;ll whistle when I reach the Spur and you
    be here to let the sliprails down for me. I&rsquo;ll time myself to get here
    about sundown. I&rsquo;ll whistle &lsquo;Willie Riley,&rsquo; so you&rsquo;ll
    know it&rsquo;s me. Good-bye, little girl! I must go now. Don&rsquo;t fret&mdash;the
    time will soon go by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He turned, swung his horse, and rode slowly down the track, turning now
    and again to wave his hand to her, with a farewell flourish of his hat as
    he rounded the Spur. His track, five hundred miles, or perhaps a thousand,
    into the great north-west; his time, six months, or perhaps a year. Hers
    a hundred yards or so back to the dusty, dreary drudgery of selection life.</p>
  <p>The daylight faded into starlight, the sidings grew very dim, and a faint
    white figure blurred against the bars of the slippanel.</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;II</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was the last day of the threshing&mdash;shortly after New Year&mdash;at
    Rocky Rises. The green boughs, which had been lashed to the veranda-posts
    on Christmas Eve, had withered and been used for firewood. The travelling
    steamer had gone with its gang of men, and the family sat down to tea, the
    men tired with hard work and heat, and with prickly heat and irritating wheaten
    chaff and dust under their clothes&mdash;and with smut (for the crop had
    been a smutty one) &ldquo;up their brains&rdquo; as Uncle Abel said&mdash;the
    women worn out with cooking for a big gang of shearers.</p>
  <p>Good-humoured Aunt Emma&mdash;who was Uncle Abel&rsquo;s niece&mdash;recovered
    first, and started the conversation. There were one or two neighbours&rsquo; wives
    who had lent crockery and had come over to help with the cooking in their
    turns. Jim Carey&rsquo;s name came up incidentally, but was quickly dropped,
    for ill reports of Jim had come home. Then Aunt Emma mentioned Harry Dale,
    and glanced meaningly at Mary, whose face flamed as she bent over her plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Mary,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nothing
    to be ashamed of. We were all girls once. There&rsquo;s many a girl would
    jump at Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who says I&rsquo;m ashamed?&rdquo; said Mary, straightening up indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tease her, Emma,&rdquo; said Mrs Carey, mildly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yer what,&rdquo; said young Tom Carey, frankly, &ldquo;Mary
    got a letter from him to-day. I seen her reading it behind the house. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Mary&rsquo;s face flamed again and went down over her plate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; said her mother, with sudden interest, &ldquo;did Harry
    say anything of Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, mother,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s why I didn&rsquo;t
    tell you about the letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause. Then Tommy said, with that delightful tact which usually
    characterizes young Tommies:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mary needn&rsquo;t be so cocky about Harry Dale, anyhow. I
    seen him New Year&rsquo;s Eve when we had the dance. I seen him after the
    dance liftin&rsquo; Bertha Buckolt onter her horse in the dark&mdash;as if
    she couldn&rsquo;t get on herself&mdash;she&rsquo;s big enough. I seen him
    lift her on, an&rsquo; he took her right up an&rsquo; lifted her right inter
    the saddle, &rsquo;stead of holdin&rsquo; his hand for her to tread on like
    that new-chum jackeroo we had. An&rsquo;, what&rsquo;s more, I seen him hug
    her an&rsquo; give her a kiss before he lifted her on. He told her he was
    as good as her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he mean by that, Tommy?&rdquo; asked Mrs Porter, to break
    an awkward pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;m I ter know what he means?&rdquo; said Tommy, politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, Tommy, I seen Harry Dale give young Tommy Carey a lick with
    a strap the day before New Year&rsquo;s Eve for throwing his sister&rsquo;s
    cat into the dam,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, coming to poor Mary&rsquo;s rescue.  &ldquo;Never
    mind, Mary, my dear, he said goodbye to you last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&nbsp;<i>he didn&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo; roared Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>They were used to Uncle Abel&rsquo;s sudden bellowing, but it startled them
    this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried both Aunt Emma and Mrs Carey, &ldquo;whatever
    do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What I means is that I ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to have the feelin&rsquo;s
    of a niece of mine trifled with. What I means is that I seen Harry Dale with
    Bertha Buckolt on New Year&rsquo;s night after he left here. That&rsquo;s
    what I means&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak so loud, Abel, we&rsquo;re not deaf,&rdquo; interrupted
    Carey, as Mary started up white-faced. &ldquo;What do you want to always
    shout for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I speak loud because I want people to hear me!&rdquo; roared Uncle
    Abel, turning on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go on, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary, &ldquo;tell me what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I mean,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, lowering his voice a little, &ldquo;that
    I seen Harry Dale and Bertha Buckolt at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate that night&mdash;I
    seen it all&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At&nbsp;<i>Buckolts&rsquo;</i>&nbsp;Gate!&rdquo;  cried Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Yes!</i>&nbsp;at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate! Ain&rsquo;t I speakin&rsquo; loud
    enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And where were you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind wheers I was. I was comin&rsquo;  home along the ridges,
    and I seen them. I seen them say good-bye; I seen them hug an&rsquo; kiss&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel!&rdquo; exclaimed Aunt Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use Uncle Abelin&rsquo; me. What I sez I sez. I ain&rsquo;t
    a-goin&rsquo; to have a niece of mine bungfoodled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried Mary, staring at him wild-eyed, &ldquo;do
    be careful what you say. You must have made a mistake. Are you sure it was
    Bertha and Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Am I sure my head&rsquo;s on me neck?&rdquo; roared Uncle Abel. &ldquo;Would
    I see &rsquo;em if I didn&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em? I tell you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now wait a moment, Uncle Abel,&rdquo;  interrupted Mary, with dangerous
    calmness. &ldquo;Listen to me. Harry Dale and I are engaged to be married,
    and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got the writin&rsquo;s!&rdquo; shouted Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The what?&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The writin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s where you are,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, triumphantly. &ldquo;If
    you had the writin&rsquo;s you could sue him for breach of contract.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel, who couldn&rsquo;t read, had no faith whatever in verbal agreements
    (he wouldn&rsquo;t sign one, he said), all others he referred to as &ldquo;writings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, listen to me, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary, trembling now. &ldquo;Are
    you sure you saw Harry Dale and Bertha Buckolt at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate after
    he left here that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, I seen young Tommy there ridin&rsquo; on
    his pony along by the Spur a little while after, an&rsquo; he muster seen
    them too, if he&rsquo;s got a tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary turned quickly to her brother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say,&rdquo; said Tommy, quietened now, &ldquo;is
    that I seen&nbsp;<i>her</i>&nbsp;at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate that night. I was
    comin&rsquo; home from Two-Mile Flat, and I met Jim with his packhorse about
    a mile the other side of Buckolts&rsquo;, and while we was talkin&rsquo; Harry
    Dale caught up, so I jist said &lsquo;So-long&rsquo; an&rsquo; left &rsquo;em.
    And when I got to Buckolt&rsquo;s Gate I seen Bertha Buckolt. She was standin&rsquo; under
    a tree, and she looked as if she was cryin&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary got her bonnet and started out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where are you going to, Mary?&rdquo; asked her mother, starting up
    nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going across to Buckolts&rsquo; to find out the truth,&rdquo; said
    Mary, and she went out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better let her go, Lizzie,&rdquo; said Aunt Emma, detaining her sister. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
    done it now, Uncle Abel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t she get the writin&rsquo;s?&rdquo;  retorted
    Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>Half-way to Buckolts&rsquo; Mary met Bertha Buckolt herself, coming over
    to the selection for the first time since the night of the party. Bertha
    started forward to kiss Mary, but stopped short as Mary stood stock-still
    and faced her, with her hands behind her back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! whatever is the matter, Mary?&rdquo;  exclaimed Bertha.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know very well, Bertha.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! Whatever do you mean? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What haven&rsquo;t you done? You&rsquo;ve&mdash;you&rsquo;ve broken
    my heart.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious me! Whatever are you talking about? Tell me what it
    is, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You met him at your gate that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bertha! How could you be so mean and deceitful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mean and deceitful! What do you mean by that? Whatever are you talking
    about? I suppose I&rsquo;ve got as good a right to meet him as anyone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; retorted Mary, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
    only stringing him on. You only did it to spite me. You helped him to deceive
    me. You ought to be ashamed to look me in the face.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good gracious! Whatever are you talking about? Ain&rsquo;t I good
    enough for him? I ought to be, God knows! I suppose he can marry who he likes,
    and if I&rsquo;m poor fool enough to love him and marry him, what then? Mary,
    you ought to be the last to speak&mdash;speak to&mdash;to me like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. He can marry all the girls in the country for all I care. I
    never want to see either him or you any more. You&rsquo;re a cruel, deceitful,
    brazen-faced hussy, and he&rsquo;s a heartless, deceiving blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mary! I believe you&rsquo;re mad,&rdquo; said Bertha, firmly. &ldquo;How
    dare you speak to me like that! And as for him being a blackguard. Why, you
    ought to be the last in the world to say such a thing; you ought to be the
    last to say a word against him. Why, I don&rsquo;t believe you ever cared
    a rap for him in spite of all your pretence. He could go to the devil for
    all you cared.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough, Bertha Buckolt!&rdquo; cried Mary. &ldquo;<i>You</i>&mdash;you!
    Why, you&rsquo;re a barefaced girl, that&rsquo;s what you are! I don&rsquo;t
    want to see your brazen face again.&rdquo; With that she turned and stumbled
    blindly in the direction of home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send back my cape,&rdquo; cried Bertha as she too turned away.</p>
  <p>Mary walked wildly home and fled to her room and locked the door. Bertha
    did likewise.</p>
  <p>Mary let Aunt Emma in after a while, ceased sobbing and allowed. herself
    to be comforted a little. Next morning she was out milking at the usual time,
    but there were dark hollows under her eyes, and her little face was white
    and set. After breakfast she rolled the cape up very tight in a brown-paper
    parcel, addressed it severely to&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center">MISS BERTHA BUCKOLT<br>
    Eurunderee Creek</p>
  <p>and sent it home by one of the school-children.</p>
  <p>She wrote to Harry Dale and told him that she knew all about it (not stating
    what), but she forgave him and hoped he&rsquo;d be happy. She never wanted
    to see his face again, and enclosed his portrait.</p>
  <p>Harry, who was as true and straight as a bushman could be, puzzled it out
    and decided that some one of his old love affairs must have come to Mary&rsquo;s
    ears, and wrote demanding an explanation.</p>
  <p>She never answered that letter.</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;III</h3>
  <p>It&nbsp;was Christmas Day at Rocky Rises. The plum puddings had been made,
    as usual, weeks beforehand, and hung in rags to the tie-beams and taken down
    and boiled again. Poultry had been killed and plucked and cooked, and all
    the toil had been gone through, and every preparation made for a red-hot
    dinner on a blazing hot day&mdash;and for no other reason than that our great-grandmothers
    used to do it in a cold climate at Christmas-times that came in mid-winter.
    Merry men hadn&rsquo;t gone forth to the wood to gather in the mistletoe
    (if they ever did in England, in the olden days, instead of sending shivering,
    wretched vassals in rags to do it); but Uncle Abel had gone gloomily up the
    ridge on Christmas Eve, with an axe on his shoulder (and Tommy unwillingly
    in tow, scowling and making faces behind his back), and had cut young pines
    and dragged them home and lashed them firmly to the veranda-posts, which
    was the custom out there.</p>
  <p>There was little goodwill or peace between the three or four farms round
    Rocky Rises that Christmas Day, and Uncle Abel had been the cause of most
    of the ill-feeling, though they didn&rsquo;t know, and he was least aware
    of it of any.</p>
  <p>It all came about in this way.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Shortly after last New Year Ryan&rsquo;s bull had broken loose and gone
    astray for two days and nights, breaking into neighbours&rsquo; paddocks
    and filling himself with hay and damaging other bulls, and making love by
    night and hiding in the scrub all day. On the second night he broke through
    and jumped over Reid&rsquo;s fences, and destroyed about an acre of grape-vines
    and adulterated Reid&rsquo;s stock, besides interfering with certain heifers
    which were not of a marriageable age. There was a &pound;5 penalty on a stray
    bull. Reid impounded the bull and claimed heavy damages. Ryan, a small selector
    of little account, was always pulling some neighbour to court when he wasn&rsquo;t
    being &ldquo;pulled&rdquo; himself, so he went to court over this case.</p>
  <p>Now, it appears that the bull, on his holiday, had spent a part of the first
    night in Carey&rsquo;s lower paddock, and Uncle Abel (who was out mooching
    about the bush at all hours, &ldquo;havin&rsquo; a look at some timber&rdquo; or
    some &ldquo;indercations&rdquo; [of gold], or on some mysterious business
    or fad, the mystery of which was of his own making)&mdash;Uncle Abel saw
    the bull in the paddock at daylight and turned it out the sliprails, and
    talked about it afterwards, referring to the sliprails as &ldquo;Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,&rdquo; of
    course, and spoke mysteriously of the case, and put on an appearance of great
    importance, and allowed people to get an idea that he knew a lot if he only
    liked to speak; and finally he got himself &ldquo;brought up&rdquo; as a
    witness for Ryan.</p>
  <p>He had a lot of beer in town before he went to the courthouse. All he knew
    would have been of no use to either party, but he swore that he had seen
    Ryan&rsquo;s bull inside Buckolts&rsquo; Gate at daylight (on the day which
    wasn&rsquo;t in question) and had turned him out. Uncle Abel mixed up the
    court a good deal, and roared like the bull, and became more obstinate the
    more he was cross-examined, and narrowly escaped being committed for contempt
    of court.</p>
  <p>Ryan, who had a high opinion of the breed of his bull, got an idea that
    the Buckolts had enticed or driven the bull into their paddock for stock-raising
    purposes, instead of borrowing it honestly or offering to pay for the use
    of it. Then Ryan wanted to know why Abel had driven his bull out of Buckolts&rsquo; Gate,
    and the Buckolts wanted to know what business Abel Albury had to drive Ryan&rsquo;s
    bull out of their paddock, if the bull had really ever been there. And so
    it went on till Rocky Rises was ripe for a tragedy.</p>
  <p>The breach between the Careys and the Buckolts was widened, the quarrel
    between Ryan and Reid intensified. Ryan got a down on the Careys because
    he reckoned that Uncle Abel had deliberately spoilt his case with his evidence;
    and the Reids and Careys were no longer on speaking terms, because nothing
    would convince old Reid that Abel hadn&rsquo;t tried to prove that Ryan&rsquo;s
    bull had never been in Reid&rsquo;s paddock at all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Well, it was Christmas Day, and the Carey family and Aunt Emma sat down
    to dinner. Jim was present, having arrived overnight, with no money, as usual,
    and suffering a recovery. The elder brother, Bob (who had a selection up-country),
    and his wife were there. Mrs Carey moved round with watchful eyes and jealous
    ears, lest there should be a word or a look which might hurt the feelings
    of her wild son&mdash;for of such are mothers.</p>
  <p>Dinner went on very moodily, in spite of Aunt Emma, until at last Jim spoke&mdash;almost
    for the first time, save for a long-whispered and, on his part, repentant
    conversation with his mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Mary!&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;What did you throw Harry
    Dale over for?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot! What did he do to you? I&rsquo;m your brother&rdquo;  (with
    a glance at Bob), &ldquo;and I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, then, ask Bertha Buckolt. She saw him last.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue, Jim! You&rsquo;ll make her cry,&rdquo; said Aunt
    Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s it all about, anyway?&rdquo;  demanded Jim. &ldquo;All
    I know is that Mary wrote to Harry and threw him over, and he ain&rsquo;t
    been the same man since. He swears he&rsquo;ll never come near the district
    again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell Jim, Aunt Emma,&rdquo; said Mary. And Aunt Emma started to tell
    the story as far as she knew.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saw her at Buckolt&rsquo;s sliprails!&rdquo; cried Jim, starting
    up. &ldquo;Well, he couldn&rsquo;t have had time to more than say good-bye
    to her, for I was with her there myself, and Harry caught up to me within
    a mile of the gate&mdash;and I rode pretty fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He had a jolly long good-bye with her,&rdquo;  shouted Uncle Abel. &ldquo;Look
    here, Jim! I ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to stand by and see a nephew of mine
    bungfoodled by no girl; an&rsquo;, I tell you I seen &rsquo;em huggin&rsquo; and
    kissin&rsquo;  and canoodlin&rsquo; for half an hour at Buckolts&rsquo; Gate!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash; Look here, Uncle Abel, be careful
    what you say. You&rsquo;ve got the bull by the tail again, that&rsquo;s what
    it is!&rdquo; Jim&rsquo;s face grew whiter&mdash;and it had been white enough
    on account of the drink. &ldquo;How did you know it was them? You&rsquo;re
    always mistaking people. It might have been someone else.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Harry Dale on horseback two miles off!&rdquo; roared Uncle
    Abel. &ldquo;And I knowed her by her cape.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Mary&rsquo;s turn to gasp and stare at Uncle Abel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Uncle Abel,&rdquo; she managed to say, &ldquo;Uncle Abel! Wasn&rsquo;t
    it at our Lower Sliprails you saw them and not Buckolts&rsquo; Gate?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; bellowed Uncle Abel. &ldquo;You might call &rsquo;em
    the &lsquo;Lower Sliprails,&rsquo; but I calls &rsquo;em Buckolts&rsquo; Gate!
    They lead to&rsquo;r&rsquo;ds Buckolts&rsquo;, don&rsquo;t they? Hey? Them
    other sliprails&rdquo;&mdash;jerking his arms in the direction of the upper
    paddock&mdash;&ldquo;them theer other sliprails that leads outer Reid&rsquo;s
    lane I calls Reid&rsquo;s Sliprails. I don&rsquo;t know nothing about no
    upper or lower, or easter or wester, or any other la-di-dah names you like
    to call &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, uncle,&rdquo; cried Mary, trembling like a leaf, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
    you explain this before? Why didn&rsquo;t you tell us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What cause have I got to tell any of you everything I sez or does
    or thinks? It &rsquo;ud take me all me time. Ain&rsquo;t you got any more
    brains than Ryan&rsquo;s bull, any of you? Hey!&mdash;You&rsquo;ve got heads,
    but so has cabbages. Explain! Why, if the world wasn&rsquo;t stuffed so full
    of jumped-up fools there&rsquo;d be never no need for explainin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mary left the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Mary?&rdquo; cried Aunt Emma.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going across to Bertha,&rdquo; said Mary, putting on her
    hat with trembling hands. &ldquo;It was me Uncle Abel saw. I had Bertha&rsquo;s
    cape on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; cried Aunt Emma,  &ldquo;whatever have you
    done?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Uncle Abel, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t she get the
    writin&rsquo;s as I told her? It&rsquo;s to be hoped she won&rsquo;t make
    such a fool of herself next time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Half an hour later, or thereabouts, Mary sat on Bertha Buckolt&rsquo;s bed,
    with Bertha beside her and Bertha&rsquo;s arm round her, and they were crying
    and laughing by turns.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me it was Jim?&rdquo; said
    Mary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me it was Harry, Mary?&rdquo; asked Bertha. &ldquo;It
    would have saved all this year of misery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t see Harry Dale at all that night,&rdquo; said Bertha. &ldquo;I
    was&mdash;I was crying when Jim left me, and when Harry came along I slipped
    behind a tree until he was past. And now, look here, Mary, I can&rsquo;t
    marry Jim until he steadies down, but I&rsquo;ll give him another chance.
    But, Mary, I&rsquo;d sooner lose him than you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Bertha walked home with Mary, and during the afternoon she took Jim aside
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jim, I&rsquo;ll give you another chance&mdash;for a year.
    Now I want you to ride into town and send a telegram to Harry Dale. How long
    would it take him to get here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t get here before New Year,&rdquo;  said Jim.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Bertha, and Jim went to catch his horse.</p>
  <p>Next day Harry&rsquo;s reply came: &ldquo;Coming.&rdquo;</p>
  <h3 align="center">Act&nbsp;IV</h3>
  <p>New&nbsp;Year&rsquo;s Eve. The dance was at Buckolts&rsquo; this year, but
    Bertha didn&rsquo;t dance much; she was down by the gate most of the time
    with little Mary Carey, waiting, and watching the long, white road, and listening
    for horses&rsquo; feet, and disappointed often as other horsemen rode by
    or turned up to the farm.</p>
  <p>And in the hot sunrise that morning, within a hundred miles of Rocky Rises,
    a tired, dusty drover camped in the edge of a scrub, boiled his quart-pot,
    broiled a piece of mutton on the coals, and lay down on the sand to rest
    an hour or so before pushing on to a cattle station he knew to try and borrow
    fresh horses. He had ridden all night.</p>
  <p>Old Buckolt and Carey and Reid smoked socially under the grape-vines, with
    bottles of whisky and glasses, and nudged each other and coughed when they
    wanted to laugh at Old Abel Albury, who was, for about the first time in
    his life, condescending to explain. He was explaining to them what thund&rsquo;rin&rsquo; fools
    they had been.</p>
  <p>Later on they sent a boy on horseback with a bottle of whisky and a message
    to Ryan, who turned up in time to see the New Year in with them and contradict
    certain slanders concerning the breed of his bull.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Bertha comforted Mary, and at last persuaded her to go home. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    sure to be here to-morrow, Mary,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you need to
    look fresh and happy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary didn&rsquo;t sleep that night; she was up before daylight, had
    the kettle on and some chops ready to fry, and at daybreak she was down by
    the sliprails again. She was turning away for the second time when she heard
    a clear whistle round the Spur&mdash;then the tune of  &ldquo;Willie Riley,&rdquo; and
    the hobblechains and camp-ware on the packhorse jingling to the tune.</p>
  <p>She pulled out the rails with eager, trembling hands and leaned against
    the tree.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An hour later a tired drover lay on his back, in his ragged, track-worn
    clothes and dusty leggings, on Mary&rsquo;s own little bed in the skillion
    off the living-room, and rested. Mary bustled round getting breakfast ready,
    and singing softly to herself; once she slipped in, bent over Harry and kissed
    him gently on the lips, and ran out as he stirred.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Uncle Abel, poking round
    early and catching a glimpse of Harry through the open door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Harry, Uncle Abel,&rdquo; said Mary.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abel peered in again to make sure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, be sure you git the writin&rsquo;s this time,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="SquatterAndSelector"></a>I<br>
    Squatter And Selector</b></h3>
  <p>Wall&nbsp;was a squatter and a hard man. There had been long years of drought
    and loss, and then came the rabbit pest&mdash;the rabbits swarmed like flies
    over his run, and cropped the ground bare where even the poor grass might
    have saved thousands of sheep&mdash;and the rabbits cost the squatter hundreds
    of pounds in &ldquo;rabbit-proof&rdquo; fences, trappers&rsquo; wages, etc.,
    just to keep them down. Then came arrangements with the bank. And then Wall&rsquo;s
    wife died. Wall started to brood over other days, and the days that had gone
    between, and developed a temper which drove his children from home one by
    one, till only Mary was left. She managed the lonely home with the help of
    a half-caste. Then in good seasons came the selectors.</p>
  <p>Men remembered Wall as a grand boss and a good fellow, but that was in the
    days before rabbits and banks, and syndicates and &ldquo;pastoralists,&rdquo; or
    pastoral companies instead of good squatters.</p>
  <p>Runs were mostly pastoral leases for which the squatter paid the Government
    so much per square mile (almost a nominal rent). Selections were small holdings
    taken up by farmers under residential and other conditions and paid for by
    instalments. If you were not ruined by the drought, and paid up long enough,
    the land became freehold. The writer is heir to a dusty patch of three hundred
    acres or so in the scrub which was taken up thirty years ago and isn&rsquo;t
    freehold yet.</p>
  <p>Selectors were allowed to take up land on runs or pastoral leases as well
    as on unoccupied Crown lands, and as they secured the best bits of land,
    and on water frontages if they could, and as, of course, selections reduced
    the area of the run, the squatters loved selectors like elder brothers. One
    man is allowed to select only a certain amount of land, and required by law
    to live on it, so the squatters bought as much freehold about the homestead
    as they could afford, selected as much as they are allowed to by law, and
    sometimes employed &ldquo;dummy&rdquo; selectors to take up choice bits about
    the runs and hold them for them. They fought selectors in many various ways,
    and, in some cases, annoyed and persecuted them with devilish ingenuity.</p>
  <p>Ross was a selector, and a very hard man physically. He was a short, nuggety
    man with black hair and frill beard (a little dusty), bushy black eyebrows,
    piercing black eyes, horny knotted hands, and the obstinacy or pluck of a
    dozen men to fight drought and the squatter. Ross selected on Wall&rsquo;s
    run, in a bend of Sandy Creek, a nice bit of land with a black soil, flat
    and red soil sidings from the ridges, which no one had noticed before, and
    with the help of his boys he got the land cleared and fenced in a year or
    two&mdash;taking bush contracts about the district between whiles to make &ldquo;tucker&rdquo; for
    the family until he got his first crop off.</p>
  <p>Wall was never accused of employing dummies, or underhanded methods in dealings
    with selectors, but he had been through so much and had brooded so long that
    he had grown very hard and bitter and suspicious, and the reverse of generous&mdash;as
    many men do who start out in life too soft and goodhearted and with too much
    faith in human nature. He was a tall, dark man. He ordered Ross&rsquo;s boys
    off the run, impounded Ross&rsquo;s stock&mdash;before Ross had got his fencing
    finished, summoned Ross for trespass, and Ross retaliated as well as he could,
    until at last it mightn&rsquo;t have been safe for one of those men to have
    met the other with a gun. The impounding of the selector&rsquo;s cattle led
    to the last bad quarrel between Wall and his son Billy, who was a tall, good-natured
    Cornstalk, and who reckoned that Australia was big enough for all of us.
    One day in the drought, and in an extra bitter mood, Wall heard that some
    of his sheep had been dogged in the vicinity of Ross&rsquo;s selection, and
    he ordered Billy to take a station-hand and watch Ross&rsquo;s place all
    night, and, if Ross&rsquo;s cattle put their noses over the boundary, to
    drive them to the pound, fifteen miles away; also to lay poisoned baits for
    the dogs all round the selection. And Billy flatly refused.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know Ross and the boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t
    believe they dogged the sheep. Why, they&rsquo;ve only got a Newfoundland
    pup and an old lame, one-eyed sheep-dog that couldn&rsquo;t hurt a flea.
    Now, father, this sort of thing has been going on long enough. What difference
    does a few paltry acres make to us? The country is big enough, God knows!
    Ross is a straight man and&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, give the man a chance
    to get his ground fenced in; he&rsquo;s doing it as fast as he can, and he
    can&rsquo;t watch his cattle day and night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you going to do as I tell you, or are you not?&rdquo; shouted
    Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if it comes to that, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said Billy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    not going to sneak round a place all night and watch for a chance to pound
    a poor man&rsquo;s cows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was an awful row, down behind the wool-shed, and things looked so bad
    that old Peter, the station-hand, who was a witness, took off his coat and
    rolled up his sleeves, ready, as he said afterwards, &ldquo;to roll into&rdquo; either
    the father or the son if one raised a hand against the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; said Billy, though rather sobered by the sight of
    his father&rsquo;s trembling, choking passion, &ldquo;do you call yourself
    an Englishman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; yelled Wall, furiously. &ldquo;What the hell do you call
    yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If it comes to that I&rsquo;m an Australian,&rdquo; said Billy, and
    he turned away and went to catch his horse. He went up-country and knocked
    about in the north-west for a year or two.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="RomeoAndJuliet"></a>II<br>
    Romeo And Juliet</b></h3>
  <p>Mary Wall was twenty-five. She was an Australian bush girl every inch of
    her five-foot-nine; she had a pink-and-white complexion, dark blue eyes,
    blue-black hair, and &ldquo;the finest figure in the district,&rdquo; on
    horseback or afoot. She was the best girl-rider too (saddle or bare-back),
    and they say that when she was a tomboy she used to tuck her petticoats under
    her and gallop man-fashion through the scrub after horses or cattle. She
    said she was going to be an old maid.</p>
  <p>There came a jackeroo on a visit to the station. He was related to the bank
    with which Wall had relations. He was a dude, with an expensive education
    and no brains. He was very vain of his education and prospects. He regarded
    Mary with undisguised admiration, and her father had secret hopes. One evening
    the jackeroo was down by the homestead-gate when Mary came cantering home
    on her tall chestnut. The gate was six feet or more, and the jackeroo raised
    his hat and hastened to open it, but Mary reined her horse back a few yards
    and the  &ldquo;dood&rdquo; had barely time to jump aside when there was
    a scuffle of hoofs on the road, a &ldquo;Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; in mid-air, a landing
    thud, and the girl was away up the home-track in a cloud of dust.</p>
  <p>A few days later the jackeroo happened to be at Kelly&rsquo;s, a wayside
    shanty, watching a fight between two bushmen, when Mary rode up. She knew
    the men. She whipped her horse in between them and struck at first one and
    then the other with her riding-whip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and
    both married men, too!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It evidently struck them that way, for after a bit they shook hands and
    went home.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t have married that girl for a thousand pounds,&rdquo;  said
    the jackeroo, relating the incidents to some friends in Sydney.</p>
  <p>Mary said she wanted a man, if she could get one.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>There was no life at home nowadays, so Mary went to all the bush dances
    in the district. She thought nothing of riding twenty or thirty miles to
    a dance, dancing all night, and riding home again next morning. At one of
    these dances she met young Robert Ross, a clean-limbed, good-looking young
    fellow about her own age. She danced with him and liked him, and danced with
    him again, and he rode part of the way home with her. The subject of the
    quarrel between the two homes came up gradually.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boss,&rdquo; said Robert, meaning his father, &ldquo;the boss
    is always ready to let bygones be bygones. It&rsquo;s a pity it couldn&rsquo;t
    be fixed up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mary, looking at him (Bob looked very well on horseback), &ldquo;it
    is a pity.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They met several times, and next Prince of Wales&rsquo;s birthday they rode
    home from the races together. Both had good horses, and they happened to
    be far ahead of the others on the wide, straight clear road that ran between
    the walls of the scrub. Along, about dusk, they became very confidential
    indeed&mdash;Mary had remarked what a sad and beautiful sunset it was. The
    horses got confidential, too, and shouldered together, and touched noses,
    and, after a long interval in the conversation, during which Robert, for
    one, began to breathe quickly, he suddenly leaned over, put his arm round
    her waist and made to kiss her. She jerked her body away, threw up her whiphand,
    and Robert ducked instinctively; but she brought her whip down on her horse&rsquo;s
    flank instead, and raced ahead. Robert followed&mdash;or, rather, his horse
    did: he thought it was a race, and took the bit in his teeth. Robert kept
    calling, appealing:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a while, Mary! I want to explain! I want to apologize! For God&rsquo;s
    sake listen to me, Mary!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Mary didn&rsquo;t hear him. Perhaps she misunderstood the reason of
    the chase and gave him credit for a spice of the devil in his nature. But
    Robert grew really desperate; he felt that the thing must be fixed up now
    or never, and gave his horse a free rein. Her horse was the fastest, and
    Robert galloped in the dust from his heels for about a mile and a half; then
    at the foot of a rise Mary&rsquo;s horse stumbled and nearly threw her over
    his head, and then he stopped like the good horse he was.</p>
  <p>Robert got down feeling instinctively that he might best make his peace
    on foot, and approached Mary with a face of misery&mdash;she had dropped
    her whip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Bob!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m knocked out;&rdquo; and
    she slipped down into his arms and stayed there a while.</p>
  <p>They sat on a log and rested, while their horses made inquiries of each
    other&rsquo;s noses, and compared notes.</p>
  <p>And after a good while Mary said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Bob, it&rsquo;s no use talking of marrying just yet. I like you.
    Bob, but I could never marry you while things are as they are between your
    father and mine. Now, that&rsquo;ll do. Let me get on my horse, Bob. I&rsquo;ll
    be safer there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Bob.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Bob, and don&rsquo;t be stupid.&rdquo; She met him often
    and &ldquo;liked&rdquo;  him.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="ATrampsMatchAndWhatItDid"></a>III<br>
    A Tramp&rsquo;s Match And What It Did</b></h3>
  <p>It was Christmas Eve at Wall&rsquo;s, but there was no score or so of buggies
    and horses and dozens of strange dogs round the place as of old. The glasses
    and decanters were dusty on the heavy old-fashioned sideboard in the dining-room;
    and there was only a sullen, brooding man leaning over the hurdles and looking
    at his rams in the yard, and a sullen, brooding halfcaste at work in the
    kitchen. Mary had ridden away that morning to visit a girl chum.</p>
  <p>It was towards the end of a long drought, and the country was like tinder
    for hundreds of miles round&mdash;the ground for miles and miles in the broiling
    scrubs &ldquo;as bare as your hand,&rdquo; or covered with coarse, dry tufts.
    There was feed grass in places, but you had to look close to see it.</p>
  <p>Shearing had finished the day before, but there was a black boy and a station-hand
    or two about the yards and six or eight shearers and rouseabouts, and a teamster
    camped in the men&rsquo;s huts&mdash;they were staying over the holidays
    to shear stragglers and clean up generally. Old Peter and a jackeroo were
    out on the run watching a bush-fire across Sandy Creek.</p>
  <p>A swagman had happened to call at the station that morning; he asked for
    work and then for tucker. He irritated Wall, who told him to clear out. It
    was the first time that a swagman had been turned away from the station without
    tucker.</p>
  <p>Swaggy went along the track some miles, brooding over his wrongs, and crossed
    Sandy Creek. He struck a match and dropped it into a convenient tuft of grass
    in a likely patch of tufts, with dead grass running from it up into the scrubby
    ridges&mdash;then he hurried on.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Did you ever see a bush-fire? Not sheets of flame sweeping and roaring from
    tree-top to tree-top, but the snaky, hissing grassfire of hardwood country.</p>
  <p>The whole country covered with thin blue smoke so that you never know in
    what direction the fire is travelling. At night you see it like the lighted
    streets of cities, in the distant ranges. It roars up the hollows of dead
    trees and gives them the appearance of factory chimneys in the dusk. It climbs,
    by shreds of bark, the trunks of old dead white-box and blue-gums&mdash;solid
    and hard as cast-iron&mdash;and cuts off the limbs. And where there&rsquo;s
    a piece of recently ringbarked country, with the dead leaves still on the
    trees, the fire will roar from bough to bough&mdash;a fair imitation of a
    softwood forest fire. The bush-fire travels through the scrubs for hundreds
    of miles, taking the grass to the roots, scorching the living bush but leaving
    it alive&mdash;for gumbush is hardest of any to kill. Where there is no undergrowth,
    and the country seems bare as a road for miles, the fire will cross, licking
    up invisible straws of grass, dusty leaves, twigs and shreds of bark on the
    hard ground already baking in the drought. You hear of a fire miles away,
    and next day, riding across the head of a gully, you hear a hissing and crackling
    and there is the fire running over the ground in lines and curves of thin
    blue smoke, snakelike, with old logs blazing on the blackened ground behind.
    Did you ever&nbsp;<i>hear</i>&nbsp;a fire where a fire should not be? There
    is something hellish in the sound of it. When the breeze is, say, from the
    east the fire runs round western spurs, up sheltered gullies&mdash;helped
    by an &ldquo;eddy&rdquo; in the wind perhaps&mdash;and appears along the
    top of the ridge, ready, with a change in the wind, to come down on farms
    and fields of ripe wheat, with a &ldquo;front&rdquo; miles long.</p>
  <p>A selector might be protected by a wide sandy creek in front and wide cleared
    roads behind, and, any hour in the day or night, a shout from the farther
    end of the wheat paddock, and&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, my God! the wheat!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wall didn&rsquo;t mind this fire much; most of his sheep were on their way
    out back, to a back run where there was young grass; and the dry ridges along
    the creek would be better for a burning-off&mdash;only he had to watch his
    fences.</p>
  <p>But, about dusk, Mary came galloping home in her usual breackneck fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;turn out the men and send them at
    once. The fire is all down by Ross&rsquo;s farm, and he has ten acres of
    wheat standing, and no one at home but him and Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; growled Wall. Then suddenly and suspiciously,  &ldquo;Have
    you been there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I came home that way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;let Ross look after his own,&rdquo; snarled the father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he can&rsquo;t, father. They&rsquo;re fighting the fire now,
    and they&rsquo;ll be burnt out before the morning if they don&rsquo;t get
    help&mdash;for God&rsquo;s sake, father, act like a Christian and send the
    men. Remember it is Christmas-time, father. You&rsquo;re surely not going
    to see a neighbour burnt out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; shouted Wall. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see every
    selector in the country burnt out, hut and all! Get off that horse and go
    inside. If a man leaves the station to-night he needn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo; (This
    last for the benefit of the men&rsquo;s hut.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get off that horse and go inside,&rdquo; roared Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; He darted forward as though to drag her from the saddle,
    but she swung her horse away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop! Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To help Ross,&rdquo; said Mary. &ldquo;He had no one to send for
    help.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then go the same way as your brother!&rdquo; roared her father; &ldquo;and
    if you show your nose back again I&rsquo;ll horse-whip you off the run!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, father,&rdquo; said Mary, and she was away.</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b><a name="TheFireAtRosssFarm"></a>IV<br>
    The Fire At Ross&rsquo;s Farm</b></h3>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s farm was in a corner between the ridges and the creek. The
    fire had come down from the creek, but the siding on that side was fairly
    clear, and they had stopped the fire there. It went behind the ridge and
    ran up and over. The ridge was covered thickly with scrub and dead grass;
    the wheat-field went well up the siding, and along the top was a bush face
    with only a narrow bridle-track between it and the long dead grass. Everything
    depended on the wind. Mary saw Ross and Mrs Ross and the daughter Jenny,
    well up the siding above the fence, working desperately, running to and fro,
    and beating out the fire with green boughs. Mary left her horse, ran into
    the hut, and looked hurriedly round for something to wear in place of her
    riding-skirt. She only saw a couple of light print dresses. She stepped into
    a skillion room, which happened to be Bob&rsquo;s room, and there caught
    sight of a pair of trousers and a coat hanging on the wall.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Bob Ross, beating desperately along a line of fire that curved down-hill
    to his right, and half-choked and blinded with the smoke, almost stumbled
    against a figure which was too tall to be his father.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me, Bob,&rdquo; said Mary, and she lifted her bough
    again.</p>
  <p>Bob stared. He was so astonished that he almost forgot the fire and the
    wheat. Bob was not thin&mdash;but&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look at me, Bob!&rdquo; said Mary, hurriedly. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    going to be married, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Let us save the wheat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was no time to waste; there was a breeze now from over the ridges,
    light, but enough to bear the fire down on them. Once, when they had breathing
    space, Mary ran to the creek for a billy of water. They beat out the fire
    all along the siding to where a rib of granite came down over the ridge to
    the fence, and then they thought the wheat was safe. They came together here,
    and Ross had time to look and see who the strange man was; then he stared
    at Mary from under his black, bushy eyebrows. Mary, choking and getting her
    breath after her exertions, suddenly became aware, said &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; and
    fled round the track beyond the point of granite. She felt a gust of wind
    and looked up the ridge. The bush fence ended here in a corner, where it
    was met by a new wire fence running up from the creek. It was a blind gully
    full of tall dead grass, and, glancing up, Mary saw the flames coming down
    fast. She ran back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;come on! The fire&rsquo;s the other
    side of the rocks!&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Back at the station, Wall walked up and down till he cooled. He went inside
    and sat down, but it was no use. He lifted his head and saw his dead wife&rsquo;s
    portrait on the wall. Perhaps his whole life ran before him in detail&mdash;but
    this is not a psychological study.</p>
  <p>There were only two tracks open to him now: either to give in, or go on
    as he was going&mdash;to shut himself out from human nature and become known
    as  &ldquo;Mean Wall,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hungry Wall,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Mad Wall,
    the Squatter.&rdquo; He was a tall, dark man of strong imagination and more
    than ordinary intelligence. And it was the great crisis of his ruined life.
    He walked to the top of a knoll near the homestead and saw the fire on the
    ridges above Ross&rsquo;s farm. As he turned back he saw a horseman ride
    up and dismount by the yard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, boss. The fences is all right.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been near Ross&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. He&rsquo;s burnt out by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Wall walked to and fro for a few minutes longer. Then he suddenly stopped
    and called, &ldquo;Peter!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ay, ay!&rdquo; from the direction of the huts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turn out the men!&rdquo; and Wall went into a shed and came out with
    his saddle on his arm.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The fire rushed down the blind gully. Showers of sparks fell on the bush
    fence, it caught twice, and they put it out, but the third time it blazed
    and roared and a fire-engine could not have stopped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The wheat must go,&rdquo; said Ross. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done our
    best,&rdquo; and he threw down the blackened bough and leaned against a tree,
    and covered his eyes with a grimy hand.</p>
  <p>The wheat was patchy in that corner&mdash;there were many old stumps of
    trees, and there were bare strips where the plough had gone on each side
    of them. Mary saw a chance, and climbed the fence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Bob,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;we might save it yet. Mr Ross,
    pull out the fence along there,&rdquo; and she indicated a point beyond the
    fire. They tramped down and tore up the wheat where it ran between the stumps&mdash;the
    fire was hissing and crackling round and through it, and just as it ran past
    them in one place there was a shout, a clatter of horses&rsquo; hoofs on
    the stones, and Mary saw her father riding up the track with a dozen men
    behind him. She gave a shriek and ran straight down, through the middle of
    the wheat, towards the hut.</p>
  <p>Wall and his men jumped to the ground, wrenched green boughs from the saplings,
    and, after twenty minutes&rsquo; hard fighting, the crop was saved&mdash;save
    for a patchy acre or so.</p>
  <p>When it was all over Ross sat down on a log and rested his head on his hands,
    and his shoulders shook.</p>
  <p>Presently he felt a hand on his shoulder, looked up, and saw Wall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shake hands, Ross,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>And it was Christmas Day.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>But in after years they used to nearly chaff the life out of Mary.  &ldquo;You
    were in a great hurry to put on the breeches, weren&rsquo;t you, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Bob&rsquo;s
    best Sunday-go-meetin&rsquo;s, too, wasn&rsquo;t they, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Rather
    tight fit, wasn&rsquo;t they, Mary?&rdquo; &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em
    on now, could you, Mary?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; reflected old Peter apart to some cronies, &ldquo;it
    ain&rsquo;t every young chap as gits an idea of the shape of his wife afore
    he marries her&mdash;is it? An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And old Peter was set down as being an innercent sort of ole cove.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHousethatwasNeverBuilt"></a>The House that
      was Never Built</b></h2>
  <p>There&nbsp;had been heavy rain and landslips all along the branch railway
    which left the Great Western Line from Sydney just beyond the Blue Mountains,
    and ran through thick bush and scrubby ridgy country and along great alluvial
    sidings&mdash;where the hills on the opposite side of the wide valleys (misty
    in depths) faded from deep blue into the pale azure of the sky&mdash;and
    over the ends of western spurs to the little farming, mining and pastoral
    town of Solong, situated in a circle of blue hills on the banks of the willow-fringed
    Cudgegong River.</p>
  <p>The line was hopelessly blocked, and some publicans at Solong had put on
    the old coach-road a couple of buggies, a wagonette, and an old mail coach&mdash;relic
    of the days of Cobb &amp; Co., which had been resurrected from some backyard
    and tinkered up&mdash;to bring the train passengers on from the first break
    in the line over the remaining distance of forty miles or so. Capertee Station
    (old time, &ldquo;Capertee Camp&rdquo;&mdash;a teamster&rsquo;s camp) was
    the last station before the first washout, and there the railway line and
    the old road parted company for the last time before reaching Solong&mdash;the
    one to run round by the ends of the western spurs that spread fanlike, and
    the other to go through and over the rough country.</p>
  <p>The train reached Capertee about midnight in broad moonlight that was misty
    in the valleys and round the blue of Crown Ridge. I got a &ldquo;box-seat&rdquo;  beside
    the driver on the old coach. It was a grand old road&mdash;one of the old
    main coach-roads of New South Wales&mdash;broad and white, metalled nearly
    all the way, and in nearly as good condition as on the day when the first
    passenger train ran into Solong and the last-used section of the old road
    was abandoned. It dated back to the bushranging days&mdash;right back to
    convict times: it ran through tall dark bush, up over gaps or &ldquo;saddles&rdquo; in
    high ridges, down across deep dark gullies, and here and there across grey,
    marshy, curlew-haunted flats. Cobb  &amp; Co&rsquo;s coach-and-six, with &ldquo;Royal
    Mail&rdquo; gilded on the panels, had dashed over it in ten and twelve-mile
    stages in the old days, the three head-lamps flashing on the wild dark bush
    at night, and maybe twenty-four passengers on board. The biggest rushes to
    richest goldfields in the west had gone over this old road on coaches, on
    carts, on drays, on horse and bullock wagons, on horseback, and on foot;
    new chums from all the world and from all stations in life.</p>
  <p class="note">When many a step was on the mountains,<br>
    Marching west to the land of gold.</p>
  <p>And a few came back rich&mdash;red, round-faced and jolly&mdash;on the box-seat
    of Cobb &amp; Co&rsquo;s, treating the driver and all hands, &ldquo;going
    home&rdquo; to sweethearts or families. (Home people will never feel the
    meaning of those two words, &ldquo;going home,&rdquo; as it is felt in a
    new land.) And many came back broken men, tramping in rags, and carrying
    their swags through the dusty heat of the drought in December or the bitter,
    pelting rain in the mountains in June. Some came back grey who went as boys;
    and there were many who never came back.</p>
  <p>I remembered the old mile-trees, with a section of bark cut away and the
    distances cut in Roman letters in the hardened sap&mdash;the distance from
    Bowenfels, the railway terminus then. It was a ghostly old road, and if it
    wasn&rsquo;t haunted it should have been. There was an old decaying and nearly
    deserted coaching town or two; there were abandoned farms and halfway inns,
    built of stone, with the roofs gone and nettles growing high between the
    walls; the remains of an orchard here and there&mdash;a few gnarled quince-trees&mdash;and
    the bush reclaiming its own again. It was a haunted ride for me, because
    I had last ridden over this old road long ago when I was young&mdash;going
    to see the city for the first time&mdash;and because I was now on my way
    to attend the funeral of one of my father&rsquo;s blood from whom I had parted
    in anger.</p>
  <p>We slowly climbed, and almost as slowly descended, the steep siding of a
    great hill called Aaron&rsquo;s Pass, and about a mile beyond the foot of
    the hill I saw a spot I remembered passing on the last journey down, long
    ago. Rising back from the road, and walled by heavy bush, was a square clearing,
    and in the background I saw plainly, by the broad moonlight, the stone foundations
    for a large house; from the front an avenue of grown pines came down to the
    road.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I exclaimed, turning to the driver, &ldquo;was that house
    burnt down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said slowly. &ldquo;That house was never built.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I stared at the place again and caught sight of a ghostly-looking light
    between the lines of the foundations, which I presently made out to be a
    light in a tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone camping there,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the driver, &ldquo;some old swaggy or &lsquo;hatter.&rsquo; I
    seen him comin&rsquo; down. I don&rsquo;t know nothing about that there place.&rdquo; (I
    hadn&rsquo;t &ldquo;shouted&rdquo;  for him yet.)</p>
  <p>I thought and remembered. I remembered myself, as a boy, being sent a coach
    journey along this road to visit some relatives in Sydney. We passed this
    place, and the women in the coach began to talk of the fine house that was
    going to be built there. The ground was being levelled for the foundations,
    and young pines had been planted, with stakes round them to protect them
    from the cattle. I remembered being mightily interested in the place, for
    the women said that the house was to be a two-storied one. I thought it would
    be a wonderful thing to see a two-storied house there in the bush. The height
    of my ambition was to live in a house with stairs in it. The women said that
    this house was being built for young Brassington, the son of the biggest
    squatter then in the district, who was going to marry the daughter of the
    next biggest squatter. That was all I remember hearing the women say.</p>
  <p>Three or four miles along the road was a public-house, with a post office,
    general store, and blacksmith shop attached, as is usual in such places&mdash;all
    that was left of the old pastoral and coaching town of Ilford. I  &ldquo;shouted&rdquo; for
    the driver at the shanty, but got nothing further out of him concerning the
    fate of the house that was never built. I wanted that house for a story.</p>
  <p>However, while yarning with some old residents at Solong, I mentioned the
    Brassingtons, and picked up a few first links in the story. The young couple
    were married and went to Sydney for their honeymoon. The story went that
    they intended to take a trip to the old country and Paris, to be away a twelve-month,
    and the house was to be finished and ready for them on their return. Young
    Brassington himself had a big sheep-run round there. The railway wasn&rsquo;t
    thought of in those days, or if it was, no Brassington could have dreamed
    that the line could have been brought to Solong in any other direction than
    through the property of the &ldquo;Big Brassingtons,&rdquo; as they were
    called. Well, the young couple went to Sydney, but whether they went farther
    the old residents did not know. All they knew was that within a few weeks,
    and before the stone foundations for the brick walls of the house were completed,
    the building contract was cancelled, the workmen were dismissed, and the
    place was left as I last saw it; only the ornamental pines had now grown
    to trees. The Brassingtons and the bride&rsquo;s people were English families
    and reserved. They kept the story, if there was a story, to themselves. The
    girl&rsquo;s people left the district and squatted on new stations up-country.
    The Big Brassingtons came down in the world and drifted to the city, as many
    smaller people do, more and more every year. Neither young Brassington nor
    his wife was ever again seen or heard of in the district.</p>
  <p>I attended my relative&rsquo;s funeral, and next day started back for Sydney.</p>
  <p>Just as we reached Ilford, as it happened, the pin of the fore under-carriage
    of the coach broke, and it took the blacksmith several hours to set it right.
    The place was dull, the publican was not communicative&mdash;or else he harped
    on the old local grievance of the railway not having come that way&mdash;so
    about half an hour before I thought the coach would be ready, I walked on
    along the road to stretch by legs. I walked on and on until I came, almost
    unaware, to the site of the house that was never built. The tent was still
    there, in fact, it was a permanent camp, and I was rather surprised to see
    the man working with a trowel on a corner of the unfinished foundations of
    the house. At first I thought he was going to build a stone hut in the corner,
    but when I got close to him I saw that he was working carefully on the original
    plan of the building: he was building the unfinished parts of the foundation
    walls up to the required height. He had bricklayer&rsquo;s tools, a bag of
    lime, and a heap of sand, and had worked up a considerable quantity of mortar.
    It was a rubble foundation: he was knocking off the thin end of a piece of
    stone to make it fit, and the clanging of the trowel prevented his hearing
    my footsteps.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day, mate,&rdquo; I said, close beside him.</p>
  <p>I half expected he&rsquo;d start when I spoke, but he didn&rsquo;t: he looked
    round slowly, but with a haunted look in his eyes as if I might have been
    one of his ghosts. He was a tall man, gaunt and haggard-eyed, as many men
    are in the bush; he may have been but little past middle age, and grey before
    his time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; he said, and he set the stone in its place, carefully
    flush with the outer edge of the wall, before he spoke again. Then he looked
    at the sun, which was low, laid down his trowel, and asked me to come to
    the tent-fire. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s turning chilly,&rdquo; he said. It was a
    model camp, everything clean and neat both inside the tent and out; he had
    made a stone fireplace with a bark shelter over it, and a table and bench
    under another little shed, with shelves for his tin cups and plates and cooking
    utensils. He put a box in front of the fire and folded a flour-bag on top
    of it for a seat for me, and hung the billy over the fire. He sat on his
    heels and poked the burning sticks, abstractedly I thought, or to keep his
    hands and thoughts steady.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;re doing a bit of building,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, keeping his eyes on the fire; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    getting on with it slowly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t suppose he looked at me half a dozen times the whole while
    I was is his camp. When he spoke he talked just as if he were sitting yarning
    in a row of half a dozen of us. Presently he said suddenly, and giving the
    fire a vicious dig with his poker:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That house must be finished by Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked, taken by surprise. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be married in
    the New Year&mdash;to the best and dearest girl in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an awkward pause on my part, but presently I pulled myself together.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never finish it by yourself,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why
    don&rsquo;t you put on some men?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t trust them. Besides,
    how am I to get bricklayers and carpenters in a place like this?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I noticed all through that his madness or the past in his mind was mixed
    up with the real and the present.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you postpone the marriage?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; he exclaimed, starting to his feet. &ldquo;No!&rdquo; and
    he looked round wildly on the darkening bush. There was madness in his tone
    that time, the last &ldquo;No!&rdquo; sounding as if from a man who was begging
    for his life.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you run up a shanty then, to live in until the house
    is ready?&rdquo; I suggested, to soothe him.</p>
  <p>He gave his arm an impatient swing. &ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;d ask that
    girl to live in a hut?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She ought to live in a palace!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There seemed no way out of it, so I said nothing: he turned his back and
    stood looking away over the dark, low-lying sweep of bush towards sunset.
    He folded his arms tight, and seemed to me to be holding himself. After a
    while he let fall his arms and turned and blinked at me and the fire like
    a man just woke from a doze or rousing himself out of a deep reverie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I almost forgot the billy!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
    make some tea&mdash;you must be hungry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He made the tea and fried a couple of slices of ham; he laid the biggest
    slice on a thick slice of white baker&rsquo;s bread on a tin plate, and put
    it and a pint-pot full of tea on a box by my side. &ldquo;Have it here, by
    the fire,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s warmer and more comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I took the plate on my knee, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed that meal.
    The bracing mountain air and the walk had made me hungry. The hatter had
    his meal standing up, cutting his ham on a slice of bread with a clasp-knife.
    It was bush fashion, and set me thinking of some old times. He ate very little,
    and, as far as I saw, he didn&rsquo;t smoke. Non-smokers are very scarce
    in the bush.</p>
  <p>I saw by the way his tent was pitched and his camp arranged generally, and
    by the way he managed the cooking, that he must have knocked about the bush
    for some years.</p>
  <p>He put the plates and things away and came and sat down on the other empty
    gin-case by my side, and fell to poking the fire again. He never showed the
    least curiosity as to who I was, or where I came from, or what I was doing
    on this deserted track: he seemed to take me as a matter of course&mdash;but
    all this was in keeping with bush life in general.</p>
  <p>Presently he got up and stood looking upwards over the place where the house
    should have been.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think now,&rdquo; he said slowly, &ldquo;I made a mistake in not
    having the verandas carried all round the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I beg pardon!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I should have had the balcony all round instead of on two sides only,
    as the man who made the plan suggested; it would have looked better and made
    the house cooler in summer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I thought as I listened, and presently I saw that it was a case of madness
    within madness, so to speak: he was mad on the idea that he could build the
    house himself, and then he had moods when he imagined that the house had
    been built and he had been married and had reared a family.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You could easily get the balcony carried round,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;it
    wouldn&rsquo;t cost much&mdash;you can get good carpenters at Solong. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have it done after Christmas.&rdquo; Then
    he turned from the house and blinked down at me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s no one at home.
    I sent the wife and family to Sydney for a change. I&rsquo;ve got the two
    boys at the Sydney Grammar School. I think I&rsquo;ll send the eldest to
    King&rsquo;s School at Parramatta. The girls will have to get along with
    a governess at home and learn to help their mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so he went on talking away just as a man who has made money in the bush,
    and is married and settled down, might yarn to an old bachelor bush mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to get a good piano,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The
    girls must have some amusement: there&rsquo;ll be no end of balls and parties.
    I suppose the boys will soon be talking of getting &lsquo;fivers&rsquo; and &lsquo;tenners&rsquo; out
    of the  &lsquo;guvner&rsquo; or &lsquo;old man.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s the way
    of the world. And they&rsquo;ll marry and leave us. It&rsquo;s the way of
    the world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was awful to hear him go on like this, the more so because he never smiled&mdash;just
    talked on as if he had said the same thing over and over again. Presently
    he stopped, and his eyes and hands began to wander: he sat down on his heel
    to the fire again and started poking it. I began to feel uneasy; I didn&rsquo;t
    know what other sides there might be to his madness, and wished the coach
    would come along.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve knocked about the bush a good deal?&rdquo; I asked.
    I couldn&rsquo;t think of anything else to say, and I thought he might break
    loose if I let him brood too long.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been in Queensland and the Gulf country, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His tone and manner seemed a bit more natural. He had knocked about pretty
    well all over Australia, and had been in many places where I had been. I
    had got him on the right track, and after a bit he started telling bush yarns
    and experiences, some of them awful, some of them very funny, and all of
    them short and good; and now and then, looking at the side of his face, which
    was all he turned to me, I thought I detected the ghost of a smile.</p>
  <p>One thing I noticed about him; when he spoke as a madman, he talked like
    a man who had been fairly well educated (or sometimes, I fancied, like a
    young fellow who was studying to be a school-teacher); his speech was deliberate
    and his grammar painfully correct&mdash;far more so than I have made it;
    but when he spoke as an old bushman, he dropped his&nbsp;<i>g&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;and
    often turned his grammar back to front. But that reminds me that I have met
    English college men who did the same thing after being a few years in the
    bush; either they dropped their particular way of speaking because it was
    mimicked, because they were laughed and chaffed out of it, or they fell gradually
    into the habit of talking as rough bushmen do (they learnt Australian), as
    clean-mouthed men fall, in spite of themselves, into the habit of swearing
    in the heat and hurry and rough life of a shearing-shed. And, coming back
    into civilized life, these men, who had been well brought up, drop into their
    old manner and style of speaking as readily as the foulest-mouthed man in
    a shed or camp&mdash;who, amongst his fellows, cannot say three words without
    an oath&mdash;can, when he finds himself in a decent home in the woman-and-girl
    world, yarn by the hour without letting slip a solitary little damn.</p>
  <p>The hatter warmed up the tea-billy again, got out some currant buns, which
    he had baked himself in the camp-oven, and we were yarning comfortably like
    two old bushmen, and I had almost forgotten that he was  &ldquo;ratty,&rdquo; when
    we heard the coach coming. I jumped up to hurry down to the road. This seemed
    to shake him up. He gripped my hand hard and glanced round in his frightened,
    haunted way. I never saw the eyes of a man look so hopeless and helpless
    as his did just then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going,&rdquo; he said, in a hurried
    way. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re going. But&mdash;but they all go.
    Come again, come again&mdash;we&rsquo;ll all be glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I had to hurry off and leave him. &ldquo;We all,&rdquo; I suppose, meant
    himself and his ghosts.</p>
  <p>I ran down between the two rows of pines and reached the road just as the
    coach came up. I found the publican from Ilford aboard&mdash;he was taking
    a trip to Sydney. As the coach went on I looked up the clearing and saw the
    hatter standing straight behind the fire, with his arms folded and his face
    turned in our direction. He looked ghastly in the firelight, and at that
    distance his face seemed to have an expression of listening blindness. I
    looked round on the dark bush, with, away to the left, the last glow of sunset
    fading from the bed of it, like a bed of reddening coals, and I looked up
    at the black loom of Aaron&rsquo;s Pass, and thought that never a man, sane
    or mad, was left in such a depth of gloomy loneliness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve been yarning with him yonder,&rdquo; said the
    publican, who seemed to have relaxed wonderfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You know these parts, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. I was about here as a boy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He asked me what my name might be. I told him it was Smith. He blinked a
    while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never heard of anyone by the name of Smith in the district,&rdquo; he
    said.</p>
  <p>Neither had I. I told him that we lived at Solong, and didn&rsquo;t stay
    long. It saved time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever heard of the Big Brassingtons?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ever heard the yarn of the house that wasn&rsquo;t built?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I told him how much I had heard of it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s about all any on &rsquo;em knows. Have you any idea
    who that man back yonder is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, who do you think it is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is, or rather he was, young Brassington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve hit it!&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;I know&mdash;and
    a few others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And do you know what became of his wife?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said the shanty-keeper, who had a generous supply of
    whisky with him, and seemed to have begun to fill himself up for the trip.</p>
  <p>He said no more for a while, and when I had remained silent long enough,
    he went on, very deliberately and impressively</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One yarn is that the girl wasn&rsquo;t any good; that when she was
    married to Brassington, and as soon as they got to Sydney, she met a chap
    she&rsquo;d been carrying on with before she married Brassington (or that
    she&rsquo;d been married to in secret), an&rsquo; she cleared off with him,
    leaving her fortnight-old husband. That was one yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was it?&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the publican. &ldquo;That yarn was a lie.&rdquo; He
    opened a flask of whisky and passed it round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There was madness in the family,&rdquo; he said, after a nip.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Brassington&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the publican, in a tone that implied contempt at
    my ignorance, in spite of its innocence, &ldquo;the girl&rsquo;s. Her mother
    had been in a  &rsquo;sylum, and so had her grandmother. It was&mdash;it
    was heridited. Some madnesses is heridited, an&rsquo; some comes through
    worry and hard graft (that&rsquo;s mine), an&rsquo; some comes through drink,
    and some through worse, and, but as far as I&rsquo;ve heard, all madnesses
    is pretty much the same. My old man was a warder in a &rsquo;sylum. They
    have their madnesses a bit different, the same as boozers has their d.t&rsquo;s
    different; but, takin&rsquo; it by the lump, it&rsquo;s pretty much all the
    same. The difference is accordin&rsquo; to their natures when they&rsquo;re
    sane. All men are&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But about young Mrs Brassington,&rdquo; I interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young Mrs Brassington? Rosy Webb she was, daughter of Webb the squatter.
    Rosy was the brightest, best, good-heartedest, an&rsquo; most ladylike little
    girl in the district, an&rsquo; the heriditry business come on her in Sydney,
    about a week after she was married to young Brassington. She was only twenty.
    Here&mdash;&rdquo; He passed the flask round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what happened?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; he repeated. Then he pulled himself together,
    as if conscious that he had shown signs of whisky. &ldquo;Everything was
    done, but it was no use. She died in a year in a &rsquo;sylum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do I know that?&rdquo; he repeated in a tone of contempt. &ldquo;How
    do I know that? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you how. My old wife was in service
    at Brassington&rsquo;s station at the time&mdash;the oldest servant&mdash;an&rsquo; young
    Brassington wired to her from Sydney to come and help him in his trouble.
    Old Mrs Brassington was bedridden, an&rsquo; they kep&rsquo; it from her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And about young Brassington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About young Brassington? He took a swag an&rsquo; wandered through
    the bush. We&rsquo;ve had him at our place several times all these years,
    but he always wandered off again. My old woman tried everything with him,
    but it was all no use. Years ago she used to get him to talk of things as
    they was, in hopes of bringin&rsquo; his mind back, but he was always worse
    after. She does all she can for him even now, but he&rsquo;s mighty independent.
    The last five or six years he&rsquo;s been taken with the idea of buildin&rsquo; that
    cursed house. He&rsquo;ll stay there till he gets short of money, an&rsquo; then
    he&rsquo;ll go out back, shearin&rsquo;, stock-ridin&rsquo;, drovin&rsquo;,
    cookin&rsquo;, fencin&rsquo;&mdash;anything till he gets a few pounds. Then
    he&rsquo;ll settle down and build away at that bloody house. He&rsquo;s knocked
    about so much that he&rsquo;s a regular old bushman. While he&rsquo;s an
    old bushman he&rsquo;s all right an&rsquo; amusin&rsquo; an&rsquo;  good
    company; but when he&rsquo;s Brassington he&rsquo;s mad&mdash;Don&rsquo;t
    you ever let on to my old woman that I told you. I allers let my tongue run
    a bit when I get out of that hole we&rsquo;re living in. We&rsquo;ve kept
    the secret all these years, but what does it matter now?&mdash;I ask you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter much,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing matters much, it seems to me, nothing matters a damn. The
    Big Brassingtons come down years ago; the old people&rsquo;s gone, and the
    young scattered God knows where or how. The Webbs (the girl&rsquo;s people)
    are away up in new country, an&rsquo; the girls (they was mostly all girls)
    are married an&rsquo; settled down by this time. We kept the secret, an&rsquo; the
    Webbs kept the secret&mdash;even when the dirty yarns was goin&rsquo; round&mdash;so&rsquo;s
    not to spoil the chances of the other girls. What about the chances of their
    husbands? Some on &rsquo;em might be in the same hell as Brassington for
    all I know. The Brassingtons kept the secret because I suppose they reckoned
    it didn&rsquo;t matter much. Nothing matters much in this world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I was thinking of another young couple who had married long ago, whose
    married life was twenty long years of shameful quarrels, of useless brutal
    recrimination&mdash;not because either was bad, but because their natures
    were too much alike; of the house that was built, of the family that was
    reared, of the sons and daughters who &ldquo;went wrong,&rdquo; of the father
    and mother separated after twenty years, of the mother dead of a broken heart,
    of the father (in a lunatic asylum), whose mania was not to build houses,
    but to obtain and secrete matches for the purpose of burning houses down.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BarneyTakeMeHomeAgain"></a>&ldquo;Barney, Take
      Me Home Again&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>This&nbsp;is a sketch of one of the many ways in which a young married woman,
    who is naturally thick-skinned and selfish&mdash;as most women are&mdash;and
    who thinks she loves her husband, can spoil his life because he happens to
    be good-natured, generous, sensitive, weak or soft, whichever you like to
    call it.</p>
  <p>Johnson went out to Australia a good many years ago with his young wife
    and two children, as assisted emigrants. He should have left his wife and
    children with her mother, in a street off City Road, N., and gone out by
    himself and got settled down comfortably and strengthened in the glorious
    climate and democratic atmosphere of Australia, and in the knowledge that
    he could worry along a while without his wife, before sending for her. That
    bit of knowledge would have done her good also, and it would have been better
    for both of them. But no man knows the future, and few can prescribe for
    their own wives. If we saw our married lives as others see them, half of
    us would get divorced. But Johnson was sentimental, he could not bear to
    part from his wife for a little while. Moreover, man is instinctively against
    leaving his wife behind; it may be either a natural or a cowardly instinct&mdash;but
    we won&rsquo;t argue that. I don&rsquo;t believe that Johnson was a coward
    in that direction; I believe that he trusted his wife implicitly, or rather
    that he never dreamed of such a thing&mdash;as is the way with most married
    men. Sentiment is selfishness, perhaps, but we won&rsquo;t argue that, such
    arguments come to nothing.</p>
  <p>I heard from a fellow-passenger of Johnson&rsquo;s that he had &ldquo;a
    hell of a voyage&rdquo; because of his young wife&rsquo;s ignorant selfishness
    and his own sensitiveness; he bribed stewards for better food and accommodation
    for his wife and children, paid the stewardess to help with the children,
    got neither rest, nor peace, nor thanks for himself, and landed in Sydney
    a nervous wreck, with five pounds out of the ten he started with.</p>
  <p>Johnson was a carpenter. He got work from a firm of contractors in Sydney,
    who, after giving him a fortnight&rsquo;s trial, sent him up-country to work
    on the railway station buildings, at the little pastoral mining and farming
    town of Solong. The railway having come to Solong, things were busy in the
    building line, and Johnson settled there.</p>
  <p>Johnson was thin when he came to Solong; he had landed a living skeleton,
    he said, but he filled out later on. The democratic atmosphere soothed his
    mind and he soon loved the place for its unconventional hospitality. He worked
    hard and seemed to have plenty of energy&mdash;he said he got it in Australia.
    He said that another year of the struggle in London would have driven him
    mad. He fished in the river on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, and, perhaps
    for the first month or so, he thought that he had found peace. Johnson&rsquo;s
    wife was a rather stout, unsympathetic-looking young woman, with the knit
    of obstinacy in her forehead; she had that stamp of &ldquo;hardness&rdquo; on
    her face which is the rule amongst English and the exception amongst Australian
    women. We of Solong thought her hard, selfish and narrow-minded, and paltry;
    later on we thought she was a &ldquo;bit touched;&rdquo; but local people
    often think that of strangers.</p>
  <p>By her voice and her habit of whining she should have been a thin, sharp-faced,
    untidy, draggled-tailed woman in a back street in London, or a worn-out selector&rsquo;s
    wife in the bush. She whined about the climate. &ldquo;It will kill the children!
    It will kill the children! We&rsquo;ll never rear them here!&rdquo; She whined
    about the &ldquo;wretched hole in the bush&rdquo; that her husband had brought
    her to; and to the women whom she condescended to visit&mdash;because a woman
    must have a woman to talk to&mdash;she exaggerated the miseries of the voyage
    until the thing became a sing-song from repetition. Later on she settled
    down to endless accounts of her home in London, of her mother and sisters,
    of the way they lived. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll never see it any more. I&rsquo;ll
    never see them any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Solong climate was reckoned the best in Australia; the  &ldquo;wretched
    hole&rdquo; was a pretty little town on the banks of a clear, willow-bordered
    river, with vineyards on the slopes, and surrounded by a circle of blue hills
    and peaks. We knew nothing of London, so she had her own way there.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll feel a bit lonely at first, but she&rsquo;ll soon get
    used to Australia,&rdquo; said Johnson. He seemed to me to go out of his
    way to excuse his wife.</p>
  <p>Johnson had had a few contracts in England at one time; they had been in &ldquo;better
    circumstances&rdquo;&mdash;that was the time she looked back to in England;
    the last two years of bitter, black struggle at &ldquo;home&rdquo; seemed
    a blank in her mind&mdash;but that&rsquo;s how women jump over facts when
    they have a selfish fad.</p>
  <p>Johnson rented a cottage and garden on the bank of the sunny river. He said
    he took the place because there was ivy growing on the cottage, and it might
    cheer his wife; but he had lost sight of the fact that, while he had been
    born in an English village, his wife had been born and bred in London, and
    had probably never noticed ivy. She said it was worse than living in a slum.</p>
  <p>Johnson was clever at his trade, and at many other things, but his wife
    didn&rsquo;t seem aware of it. He was well liked, he grew to be popular,
    but she didn&rsquo;t seem proud of the fact; she never seemed interested
    in him or his prospects. She only wanted him to take her home again. We mustn&rsquo;t
    forget that while he had a rush of work to occupy his mind she had not.</p>
  <p>But Johnson grew stouter and prospered in spite of his wife&mdash;for a
    year or so. New schools were being built in the district and the town was
    practically re-built. Johnson took contracts for brickwork, plumbing and
    house-painting, as well as carpentering, and had at one time as many as ten
    men in his employ. He was making money.</p>
  <p>I was working at my trade then, house-painting, and worked for Johnson.
    I lodged at his cottage for a while, but soon got tired of hearing about
    London, and Mrs Johnson&rsquo;s mother and sisters, and the house they lived
    in, and the street it was in, and the parks where they used to take their
    babies, and the shopping on Saturday afternoon. That woman was terrible.
    She was at Johnson all the time about taking her home. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
    surely be able to go home this year, Will.&rdquo; &ldquo;You promised to
    take me home by the end of the year.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Mother says in her last
    letter that Jack says there&rsquo;s more building going on about London than
    ever.&rdquo; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do just as well in London as you&rsquo;ll
    do here.&rdquo;  &ldquo;What chance have the children got in a hole like
    this?&rdquo; And the rest of it&mdash;every night. When he took a new contract,
    it would be, &ldquo;What did you want to take that new contract for, Will,
    when we&rsquo;re going home? You know you promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t
    take any more contracts.&rdquo; First he&rsquo;d try to cheer her, then he&rsquo;d
    argue; but she&rsquo;d only sit with the knit in her forehead deep, looking
    as obstinate as a mule. Then she&rsquo;d sit down to a little harmonium he&rsquo;d
    bought her and play and sing &ldquo;Barney, take me Home again,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
    Old Folks at Home,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Swannie Ribber,&rdquo; till I felt
    like hanging myself&mdash;and&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t an exile. Sometimes
    Johnson would flare up and there&rsquo;d be a row and he&rsquo;d go to the
    pub. Gentle persuasion, argument, or swearing, it was all the same with her.</p>
  <p>Bosses and men were different towards each other in Solong to what they
    are in London; besides, when I wasn&rsquo;t Johnson&rsquo;s sub-contractor
    I was his foreman&mdash;so we often had a few drinks together; and one night
    over a beer (and after a breeze at home, I think) he said to me:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it out, Harry; there was nothing but struggle
    and worry and misery for us in England, and London was smothering me, my
    chest was bad and the wife was always in ill-health; but I suppose I&rsquo;ll
    have to take her home in the end or else she&rsquo;ll go melancholy mad!&rdquo; And
    he drew a breath that was more like a gasp than a sigh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why not send her home for a trip, or a year or so, boss?&rdquo; I
    asked. &ldquo;As likely as not she&rsquo;ll be just as eager to get back;
    and that will be the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that, Harry,&rdquo; said Johnson. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
    stay here and work alone. It would be like beginning life again; I&rsquo;ve
    started twice and couldn&rsquo;t start the third time. You&rsquo;ll understand
    when you&rsquo;re married, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Well, in the end, she wore Johnson out&mdash;or wore into him rather. He
    drank more, and once or twice I saw him drinking alone. Sometimes he&rsquo;d &ldquo;round
    on us&rdquo; at work for nothing at all, and at other times he&rsquo;d take
    no interest in the jobs&mdash;he&rsquo;d let the work go on anyhow. Some
    thought that Johnson was getting too big for his boots, that&rsquo;s how
    men are misjudged. He grew moody and melancholy and thin again. Johnson was
    homesick himself. No doubt it was the misery of his domestic life in Australia
    that made him so.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of the third or fourth year Johnson threw up a couple of
    contracts he had on hand, sacrificed a piece of land which he had bought
    and on which he had built a cottage in the short time he had been in Solong,
    and, one lovely day in June, when the skies were their fairest, the hills
    their bluest, the river its widest and clearest, and the grass was waving
    waist high after rain&mdash;one blue and green and golden day the Johnsons
    left Solong, with the trunks they had brought out with them, for Sydney,&nbsp;<i>en
    route</i>&nbsp;for smoky London.</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson was a woman transformed&mdash;she was happy and looked it. The
    last few weeks she had seemed in every way the opposite of the woman we had
    known: cheerful, kind to neighbours in sickness and trouble, even generous;
    she made many small presents in the way of mantelshelf ornaments, pictures,
    and house-linen. But then it was Johnson who had to pay for that in the end.</p>
  <p>He looked worn and worried at the railway station&mdash;more like himself
    as he was when he first came to Solong&mdash;and as the train moved off I
    thought he looked&mdash;well, frightened.</p>
  <p>That must have been nearly twenty years ago.</p>
  <p align="center">&nbsp;* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>London last winter. It was one of those days when London&rsquo;s lurid sun
    shows up for a little while like a smoky danger signal. The snow had melted
    from the house-tops and the streets were as London streets are after the
    first fall of snow of the season. But I could stand the flat no longer, I
    had to go out and walk. I was sun-sick&mdash;I was heart-sick for the sun,
    for the sunny South&mdash;for grassy plains, blue mountains, sweeps of mountain
    bush and sunny ocean beaches. I walked hard; I walked till I was mud-splashed
    to the shoulders; I walked through the squalid, maddening sameness of miles
    of dingy, grimy-walled blocks and rows of four-storied houses till I felt
    smothered&mdash;jailed, hopelessly. &ldquo;Best get home and in, and draw
    the blinds on it,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;or my brain will turn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was about to ask a policeman where I was when I saw, by the name on a
    corner of the buildings, that I was in City Road, North.</p>
  <p>All the willow-fringed rivers and the sunny hills of Solong flashed before
    me at the sight of the name of that street. I had not been able to recall
    the name of the street off City Road in which the Johnsons lived, though
    I had heard it often enough in the old days from the tongue of Mrs Johnson.</p>
  <p>I felt it would be a relief to see anyone who had been in Australia. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; I
    thought, &ldquo;if I walk along City Road and see the name of that street
    I&rsquo;ll remember it&rdquo;&mdash;and I did. It was a blind street, like
    the long, narrow yard of a jail, walled by dark houses, all alike. The next
    door but one to that at which I knocked to inquire was where the Johnsons
    lived; they lived in a four-storied house, or rather a narrow section of
    a four-storied terrace. I found later on that they paid the landlord, or
    nearly paid him, by letting lodgings. They lived in one room with the use
    of the parlour and the kitchen when the lodgers weren&rsquo;t using them,
    and the son shared a room with a lodger. The back windows looked out on the
    dead wall of a poorhouse of some kind, the front on rows of similar windows
    opposite&mdash;rows of the same sort of windows that run for miles and miles
    in London. In one a man sat smoking in his shirtsleeves, from another a slavey
    leaned out watching a fourwheeler that had stopped next door, in a third
    a woman sat sewing, and in a fourth a woman was ironing, with a glimpse of
    a bedstead behind her. And all outside was gloom and soot and slush.</p>
  <p>I would never have recognized the Johnsons. I have visited them several
    times since and their faces are familiar to me now, but I don&rsquo;t know
    whether any traces of the old likenesses worked up in my memory. I found
    Johnson an old man&mdash;old and grey before his time. He had a grizzly stubble
    round his chin and cheeks towards the end of the week, because he could only
    afford a shave on Saturday afternoon. He was working at some branch of his
    trade &ldquo;in the shop&rdquo; I understood, but he said he felt the work
    come heavier on him every winter. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve felt very poorly this
    last winter or two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very poorly indeed.&rdquo; He
    was very sad and gentle.</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson was old and thin-looking, but seemed cheerful and energetic.
    Some chest trouble kept her within doors most of the winter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind so long as I can manage,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but
    Johnson gets so depressed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They seemed very kind towards each other; they spoke little of Australia,
    and then only as an incident in their lives which was not of any importance&mdash;had
    long been past and done with. It was all &ldquo;before we went to Australia&rdquo; or &ldquo;after
    we came back from Australia,&rdquo; with Mrs Johnson.</p>
  <p>The son, whom I remembered as a bright, robust little fellow, was now a
    tall, white-faced, clean-shaven young man, a clerk on thirty shillings a
    week. He wore, on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, a tall hat and a frock
    coat and overcoat made cheaply in the latest fashion, so he couldn&rsquo;t
    afford to help the old folk much.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;David is very extravagant,&rdquo; said the old man, gently. &ldquo;He
    won&rsquo;t wear anything when once the gloss is off it. But,&rdquo; with
    a sad smile, &ldquo;I get the left-off overcoats.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He took me across to see his daughter. She had married a tradesman and they
    were having a hard struggle in three rooms in a workman&rsquo;s dwelling.
    She was twenty-five, thin, yellow, and looking ten years older.</p>
  <p>There were other children who had died. &ldquo;I think we might have done
    better for the children in Australia,&rdquo; said the old man to me, sadly,
    when we got outside, &ldquo;but we did our best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We went into a hotel and had a drink. Johnson had treated last time&mdash;twenty
    years before. We call treating &ldquo;shouting&rdquo; in Australia. Presently
    Johnson let fall a word or two of Australian slang, and brightened up wonderfully;
    we got back out into Australia at once and stayed there an hour or so. Being
    an old man, Johnson&rsquo;s memory for the long ago was better than mine,
    and I picked up links; and, in return, I told him what Solong was like now,
    and how some men he knew, who were going up, had gone down, and others, who
    were going to the dogs in his time, had gone up&mdash;and we philosophized.
    About one he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Ah, well! who&rsquo;d have thought it! I
    never thought that boy would come to any good;&rdquo; about another, &ldquo;Ah,
    well! and he might have been an independent man.&rdquo; How familiar that
    expression sounded!&mdash;I think it is used more often in Australia than
    in any other country: &ldquo;He might have been an independent man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When I left Johnson I felt less lonely in London, and rather humbled in
    spirit. He seemed so resigned&mdash;I had never seen such gentle sadness
    in a man&rsquo;s eyes, nor heard it in a man&rsquo;s voice. I could get back
    to Australia somehow and start life again, but Johnson&rsquo;s day had been
    dead for many years.  &ldquo;Besides, assisted emigration&rsquo;s done away
    with now,&rdquo; he said, with his sad, sad smile.</p>
  <p>I saw the Johnsons again later on. &ldquo;Things have been going very sadly
    with us, very sadly indeed,&rdquo; said the old man, when we&rsquo;d settled
    down. He had broken down at the beginning of the winter, he had dragged himself
    out of bed and to work and back again until he could do so no longer; he
    had been laid up most of the winter. Mrs Johnson had not been outside the
    door for months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It comes very hard on us,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m so
    poorly, and David out of work, too. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind if I could get
    about. But,&rdquo; she went on in her energetic manner, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    had the house full all the winter; we&rsquo;ve had very good luck with the
    lodgers, all respectable people, and one of them answers the door and that
    keeps me away from the draught&mdash;so it might be worse, mightn&rsquo;t
    it! But Johnson doesn&rsquo;t seem to mend at all, and he gets so terribly
    depressed. But the warm weather coming on, etc.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They and the Lord only knew how they managed to live, for they are honest
    people and the lodgers scarcely pay the rent of the house. There was only
    David between them and the poorhouse, as far as I could see.</p>
  <p>Johnson came out with me a piece and we had a drink or two together&mdash;his
    was gin hot. He talked a good deal about Australia, but sadly and regretfully
    on this occasion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We could have done well in Australia,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very
    well indeed. I might have been independent and the children well started
    in life. But we did things for the best. Mrs Johnson didn&rsquo;t like Australia,
    you know. It was a pity we didn&rsquo;t stay there, a great pity. We would
    have done far better than in England. I&rsquo;d go out again now if I had
    the money, but I&rsquo;m getting too old.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would Mrs Johnson go out?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. But I&rsquo;m afraid she wouldn&rsquo;t stand the voyage.
    . . . Things have been very sad with us ever since we came back to England,
    very sad indeed.&rdquo; And after a while he suddenly caught his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It takes me that way sometimes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I catch my
    breath just as if I was going to lose it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADrovingYarn"></a>A Droving Yarn</b></h2>
  <p>Andy Maculloch&nbsp;had heard that old Bill Barker, the well-known overland
    drover, had died over on the Westralian side, and Dave Regan told a yarn
    about Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bill Barker,&rdquo; said Dave, talking round his pipe stem, &ldquo;was
    the&nbsp;<i>quintessence</i>&nbsp;of a drover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whatter, Dave?&rdquo; came the voice of Jim Bentley, in startled
    tones, from the gloom on the far end of the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The quintessence,&rdquo; said Dave, taking his pipe out of his mouth.  &ldquo;You
    shut up, Jim. As I said, Bill Barker was the quintessence of a drover. He&rsquo;d
    been at the game ever since he was a nipper. He run away from home when he
    was fourteen and went up into Queensland. He&rsquo;s been all over Queensland
    and New South Wales and most of South Australia, and a good deal of the Western,
    too: over the great stock routes from one end to the other, Lord knows how
    many times. No man could keep up with him riding out, and no one could bring
    a mob of cattle or a flock of sheep through like him. He knew every trick
    of the game; if there was grass to be had Bill&rsquo;d get it, no matter
    whose run it was on. One of his games in a dry season was to let his mob
    get boxed with the station stock on a run where there was grass, and before
    Bill&rsquo;s men and the station-hands could cut &rsquo;em out, the travelling
    stock would have a good bellyful to carry them on the track. Billy was the
    daddy of the drovers. Some said that he could ride in his sleep, and that
    he had one old horse that could jog along in his sleep too, and that&mdash;travelling
    out from home to take charge of a mob of bullocks or a flock of sheep&mdash;Bill
    and his horse would often wake up at daylight and blink round to see where
    they were and how far they&rsquo;d got. Then Bill would make a fire and boil
    his quart-pot, and roast a bit of mutton, while his horse had a mouthful
    of grass and a spell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You remember Bill, Andy? Big dark man, and a joker of the loud sort.
    Never slept with a blanket over him&mdash;always folded under him on the
    sand or grass. Seldom wore a coat on the route&mdash;though he always carried
    one with him, in case he came across a bush ball or a funeral. Moleskins,
    flannel waistcoat, cabbage-tree hat and &rsquo;lastic-side boots. When it
    was roasting hot on the plains and the men swore at the heat, Jim would yell, &lsquo;Call
    this hot? Why, you blanks, I&rsquo;m freezin&rsquo;! Where&rsquo;s me overcoat?&rsquo; When
    it was raining and hailing and freezing on Bell&rsquo;s Line in the Blue
    Mountains in winter, and someone shivered and asked, &lsquo;Is it cold enough
    for yer now, Bill?&rsquo; &lsquo;Cold!&rsquo; Bill would bellow, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    sweatin&rsquo;!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember it well. I was little more than a youngster then&mdash;Bill
    Barker came past our place with about a thousand fat sheep for the Homebush
    sale-yards at Sydney, and he gave me a job to help him down with them on
    Bell&rsquo;s Line over the mountains, and mighty proud I was to go with him,
    I can tell you. One night we camped on the Cudgegong River. The country was
    dry and pretty close cropped and we&rsquo;d been &ldquo;sweating&rdquo; the
    paddocks all along there for our horses. You see, where there weren&rsquo;t
    sliprails handy we&rsquo;d just take the tomahawk and nick the top of a straight-grained
    fence-post, just above the mortise, knock out the wood there, lift the top
    rail out and down, and jump the horses in over the lower one&mdash;it was
    all two-rail fences around there with sheep wires under the lower rail. And
    about daylight we&rsquo;d have the horses out, lift back the rail, and fit
    in the chock that we&rsquo;d knocked out. Simple as striking matches, wasn&rsquo;t
    it?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the horses were getting a good bellyful in the police horse
    paddock at night, and Bill took the first watch with the sheep. It was very
    cold and frosty on the flat and he thought the sheep might make back for
    the ridges, it&rsquo;s always warmer up in the ridges in winter out of the
    frost. Bill roused me out about midnight. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s the sheep,&rsquo; he
    says, pointing to a white blur. &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve settled down. I think
    they&rsquo;ll be quiet till daylight. Don&rsquo;t go round them; there&rsquo;s
    no occasion to go near &rsquo;em. You can stop by the fire and keep an eye
    on &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The night seemed very long. I watched and smoked and toasted my shins,
    and warmed the billy now and then, and thought up pretty much the same sort
    of old things that fellers on night watch think over all over the world.
    Bill lay on his blanket, with his back to the fire and his arm under his
    head&mdash;freezing on one side and roasting on the other. He never moved.
    I itched once or twice to turn him over and bake the front of him&mdash;I
    reckoned he was about done behind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At last daylight showed. I took the billy and started down to the
    river to get some water to make coffee; but half-way down, near the sheep
    camp, I stopped and stared, I was never so surprised in my life. The white
    blur of sheep had developed into a couple of acres of long dead silver grass!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I woke Bill, and he swore as I never heard a man swear before&mdash;nor
    since. He swore at the sheep, and the grass, and at me; but it would have
    wasted time, and besides I was too sleepy and tired to fight. But we found
    those sheep scattered over a scrubby ridge about seven miles back, so they
    must have slipped away back of the grass and started early in Bill&rsquo;s
    watch, and Bill must have watched that blessed grass for the first half of
    the night and then set me to watch it. He couldn&rsquo;t get away from that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wondered what the chaps would say if it got round that Bill Barker,
    the boss overland drover, had lost a thousand sheep in clear country with
    fences all round; and I suppose he thought that way too, for he kept me with
    him right down to Homebush, and when he paid me off he threw in an extra
    quid, and he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, listen here, Dave! If I ever hear a word from anyone
    about watching that gory grass, I&rsquo;ll find you, Dave, and murder you,
    if you&rsquo;re in wide Australia. I&rsquo;ll screw your neck, so look out.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dead now, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>There was silence for some time after Dave had finished. The chaps made
    no comment on the yarn, either one way or the other, but sat smoking thoughtfully,
    and in a vague atmosphere as of sadness&mdash;as if they&rsquo;d just heard
    of their mother&rsquo;s death and had not been listening to an allegedly
    humorous yarn.</p>
  <p>Then the voice of old Peter, the station-hand, was heard to growl from the
    darkness at the end of the hut, where he sat on a three-bushel bag on the
    ground with his back to the slabs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s old Peter growlin&rsquo; about?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wants to know where Dave got that word,&rdquo; someone else replied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What word?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Quint-essents</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a chuckle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He got it out back, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell, the shearer. &ldquo;He
    got it from a new chum.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How much did yer give for it, Dave?&rdquo; growled Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Five shillings, Peter,&rdquo; said Dave, round his pipe stem. &ldquo;And
    stick of tobacco thrown in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter seemed satisfied, for he was heard no more that evening.</p>

  <p align="center" class="note">A Rather Fishy Yarn From The Bush<br>
    (As Told By&nbsp;James&nbsp;Nowlett, Bullock-Driver)</p>
  <p>You&nbsp;might work this yarn up. I&rsquo;ve often thought of doin&rsquo; it
    meself, but I ain&rsquo;t got the words. I knowed a lot of funny an&rsquo; rum
    yarns about the bush, an&rsquo; I often wished I had the gift o&rsquo; writin&rsquo;.
    I could tell a lot better yarns than the rot they put in books sometimes,
    but I never had no eddication. But you might be able to work this yarn up&mdash;as
    yer call it.</p>
  <p>There useter be a teamster&rsquo;s camp six or seven miles out of Mudgee,
    at a place called th&rsquo; Old Pipeclay, in the days before the railroad
    went round to Dubbo, an&rsquo; most of us bullickies useter camp there for
    the night. There was always good water in the crick, an&rsquo; sometimes
    we&rsquo;d turn the bullicks up in the ridges an&rsquo; gullies behind for
    grass, an&rsquo; camp there for a few days, and do our washin&rsquo; an&rsquo; mendin&rsquo;,
    and make new yokes perhaps, an&rsquo; tinker up the wagons.</p>
  <p>There was a woman livin&rsquo; on a farm there named Mrs Hardwick&mdash;an&rsquo;  she
    was a hard wick. Her husban&rsquo;, Jimmy Hardwick, was throwed from his
    horse agenst a stump one day when he was sober, an&rsquo; he was killed&mdash;an&rsquo; she
    was a widder. She had a tidy bit o&rsquo; land, an&rsquo; a nice bit of a
    orchard an&rsquo; vineyard, an&rsquo; some cattle, an&rsquo; they say she
    had a tidy bit o&rsquo; money in the bank. She had the worst tongue in the
    district, no one&rsquo;s character was safe with her; but she wasn&rsquo;t
    old, an&rsquo; she wasn&rsquo;t bad-lookin&rsquo;&mdash;only hard&mdash;so
    there was some fellers hangin&rsquo; round arter her. An&rsquo; Dave Regan&rsquo;s
    horse was hangin&rsquo; up outside her place as often as anybody else&rsquo;s.
    Dave was a native an&rsquo; a bushy, an&rsquo; a drover an&rsquo; a digger,
    an&rsquo; he was a bit soft in them days&mdash;he got hard enough arterwards.</p>
  <p>Mrs Hardwick hated bullick-drivers&mdash;she had a awful down on bullickies&mdash;I
    dunno why. We never interfered with her fowls, an&rsquo; as for swearin&rsquo;!
    why, she could swear herself. Jimmy Hardwick was a bullick-driver when she
    married him, an&rsquo; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps that helped to account for it.
    She wouldn&rsquo;t let us boil our billies at her kitchen fire, same as any
    other bushwoman, an&rsquo;  if one of our bullicks put his nose under her
    fence for a mouthful of grass, she&rsquo;d set her dogs onter him. An&rsquo; one
    of her dogs got something what disagreed with him one day, an&rsquo; she
    accused us of layin&rsquo; poisoned baits. An&rsquo;, arter that, she &rsquo;pounded
    some of our bullicks that got into her lucerne paddick one night when we
    was on the spree in Mudgee, an&rsquo; put heavy damages on &rsquo;em. She&rsquo;d
    left the sliprails down on purpose, I believe. She talked of puttin&rsquo; the
    police onter us, jest as if we was a sly-grog shop. (If&nbsp;<i>she&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;kept
    a sly-grog shop she&rsquo;d have had a different opinion about bullick-drivers.)
    An&rsquo;  all the bullick-drivers hated her because she hated bullickies.</p>
  <p>Well, one wet season half a dozen of us chaps was camped there for a fortnight,
    because the roads was too boggy to travel, an&rsquo; one night they got up
    a darnce at Peter Anderson&rsquo;s shanty acrost the ridges, an&rsquo; a
    lot of gals an&rsquo;  fellers turned up from all round about in spite of
    the pourin&rsquo; rain. Someone had kidded Dave Regan that Mother Hardwick
    was comin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he turned up, of course, in spite of a ragin&rsquo; toothache
    he had. He was always ridin&rsquo; the high horse over us bullickies. It
    was a very cold night, enough to cut the face an&rsquo;  hands off yer, so
    we had a roarin&rsquo; fire in the big bark-an&rsquo;-slab kitchen where
    the darncin&rsquo; was. It was one of them big, old-fashioned, clay-lined
    fire-places that goes right acrost the end of the room, with a twenty-five
    foot slab-an&rsquo;-tin chimbly outside.</p>
  <p>Dave Regan was pretty wild about being had, an&rsquo; we copped all the
    gals for darncin&rsquo;; he couldn&rsquo;t get one that night, an&rsquo; when
    he wasn&rsquo;t proddin&rsquo;  out his tooth with a red-hot wire someone
    was chaffin&rsquo; him about Mrs Hardwick. So at last he got disgusted an&rsquo; left;
    but before he went he got a wet three-bushel flour-bag an&rsquo; climbed
    up very quietly onter the roof by the battens an&rsquo; log weights an&rsquo; riders,
    an&rsquo; laid the wet bag very carefully acrost the top of the chimbly flue.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; we was a mortal hour tryin&rsquo; to find out what was the matter
    with that infernal chimbly, and tackin&rsquo; bits o&rsquo; tin an&rsquo; baggin&rsquo; acrost
    the top of the fire-place under the mantelshelf to try an&rsquo; stop it
    from smokin&rsquo;, an&rsquo;  all the while the gals set there with the
    water runnin&rsquo; out of their eyes. We took the green back log out an&rsquo; fetched
    in a dry one, but that chimbly smoked worse than ever, an&rsquo; we had to
    put the fire out altogether, an&rsquo; the gals set there shiverin&rsquo; till
    the rain held up a bit an&rsquo; the sky cleared, an&rsquo; then someone
    goes out an&rsquo; looks up an&rsquo; sings out, &ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s
    somethin&rsquo; acrost the top of the blazin&rsquo; chimbly!&rdquo; an&rsquo; someone
    else climbs up an&rsquo; fetches down the bag. But the darnce was spoilt,
    an&rsquo; the gals was so disgusted that they went off with their fellers
    while the weather held up. They reckoned some of us bullickies did it for
    a lark.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; arter that Dave&rsquo;d come ridin&rsquo; past, an&rsquo; sing
    out to know if we knew of a good cure for a smokin&rsquo; chimbly, an&rsquo; them
    sorter things. But he always got away before we could pull him off of his
    horse. Three of us chased him on horseback one day, but we didn&rsquo;t ketch
    him.</p>
  <p>So we made up our minds to git back on Dave some way or other, an&rsquo;  it
    come about this way.</p>
  <p>About six months arter the smoked-out darnce, four or five of us same fellers
    was campin&rsquo; on th&rsquo; Pipeclay agen, an&rsquo; it was a dry season.
    It was dryer an&rsquo; hotter than it was cold &lsquo;n&rsquo; wet the larst
    time. Dave was still hangin&rsquo; round Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s an&rsquo; doin&rsquo; odd
    jobs for her. Well, one very hot day we seen Dave ridin&rsquo; past into
    Mudgee, an&rsquo; we knowed he&rsquo;d have a spree in town that night, an&rsquo; call
    at Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s for sympathy comin&rsquo; out next day; an&rsquo;  arter
    he&rsquo;d been gone an hour or two, Tom Tarrant comes drivin&rsquo; past
    on his mail-coach, an&rsquo; drops some letters an&rsquo; papers an&rsquo; a
    bag o&rsquo; groceries at our camp.</p>
  <p>Tom was a hard case. I remember wonst I was drivin&rsquo; along a lonely
    bit o&rsquo; track, an&rsquo; it was a grand mornin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I felt
    great, an&rsquo; I got singin&rsquo;  an&rsquo; practisin&rsquo; a recitation
    that I allers meant to give at a bush darnce some night. (I never sung or
    spouted poetry unless I was sure I was miles away from anyone.) An&rsquo; I
    got worked up, an&rsquo; was wavin&rsquo; me arms about an&rsquo; throwin&rsquo; it
    off of me chest, when Tom&rsquo;s coach comes up behind, round a bend in
    the road, an&rsquo;  took me by surprise. An&rsquo; Tom looked at me very
    hard an&rsquo; he says, &ldquo;What are yer shoutin&rsquo; an&rsquo; swearin&rsquo; an&rsquo; darncin&rsquo; an&rsquo; goin&rsquo; on
    at the bullicks like that for, Jimmy? They seem to be workin&rsquo; all right.&rdquo; It
    took me back, I can tell yer. The coach was full of grinnin&rsquo; passengers,
    an&rsquo; the worst of it was that I didn&rsquo;t know how long Tom had been
    drivin&rsquo; slow behind me an&rsquo; takin&rsquo; me out of windin&rsquo;.
    There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; upsets a cove as can&rsquo;t sing so much as
    to be caught singin&rsquo; or spoutin&rsquo; poetry when he thinks he&rsquo;s
    privit&rsquo;.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; another time I remember Tom&rsquo;s coach broke down on the track,
    an&rsquo; he had to ride inter town with the mails on horseback; an&rsquo; he
    left a couple of greenhides, for Skinner the tanner at Mudgee, for me to
    take on in the wagon, an&rsquo; a bag of potatoes for Murphy the storekeeper
    at Home Rule, an&rsquo; a note that said: &ldquo;Render unto Murphy the things
    which is murphies, and unto Skinner them things which is skins.&rdquo; Tom
    was a hard case.</p>
  <p>Well, this day, when Tom handed down the tucker an&rsquo; letters, he got
    down to stretch his legs and give the horses a breathe. The coach was full
    of passengers, an&rsquo; I noticed they all looked extra glum and sulky,
    but I reckoned it was the heat an&rsquo; dust. Tom looked extra solemn, too,
    an&rsquo; no one was talkin&rsquo;. Then I suddenly began to notice something
    in the atmosphere, as if there was a dead beast not far away, an&rsquo; my
    mates started sniffin&rsquo; too. An&rsquo;  that reminds me, it&rsquo;s
    funny why some people allers sniff hard instead of keepin&rsquo; their noses
    shut when there&rsquo;s a stink; the more it stinks the more they sniff.
    Tom spit in the dust an&rsquo; thought a while; then he took a parcel out
    of the boot an&rsquo; put it on the corner post of the fence. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some fresh fish that come up from Sydney by train
    an&rsquo; Cobb &amp; Co&rsquo;s coach larst night. They&rsquo;re meant for
    White the publican at Gulgong, but they won&rsquo;t keep this weather till
    I git out there. Pity to waste them! you chaps might as well have a feed
    of &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll tell White they went bad an&rsquo; I had to throw
    them out,&rdquo; says Tom. Then he got on to the coach agen an&rsquo; drove
    off in a cloud of dust. We undone the brown paper, an&rsquo; the fish was
    in a small deal box, with a lid fastened by a catch. We nicked back the catch
    an&rsquo; the lid flew open, an&rsquo;  then we knowed where the smell comed
    from all right. There wasn&rsquo;t any doubt about that! We didn&rsquo;t
    have to put our noses in the box to see if the fish was bad. They was packed
    in salt, but that made no difference.</p>
  <p>You know how a smell will start sudden in the bush on a hot, still day,
    an&rsquo; then seem to take a spell, an&rsquo; then get to work agen stronger
    than ever. You might be clost alongside of a horse that has been dead a fortnight
    an&rsquo; smell nothin&rsquo; particular till you start to walk away, an&rsquo; the
    further you go the worse it stinks. It seems to smell most round in a circle
    of a hundred yards or so. But these fish smelt from the centre right out.
    Tom Tarrant told us arterwards that them fish started to smell as soon as
    he left Mudgee. At first they reckoned it was a dead horse by the road; but
    arter a while the passengers commenced squintin&rsquo; at each other suspicious
    like, an&rsquo; the conversation petered out, an&rsquo; Tom thought he felt
    all their eyes on his back, an&rsquo; it was very uncomfortable; an&rsquo; he
    sat tight an&rsquo; tried to make out where the smell come from; an&rsquo; it
    got worse every hundred yards&mdash;like as if the track was lined with dead
    horses, an&rsquo; every one dead longer than the last&mdash;till it was like
    drivin&rsquo; a funeral. An&rsquo; Tom never thought of the fish till he
    got down to stretch his legs and fetched his nose on a level with the boot.</p>
  <p>Well, we shut down the lid of that box quick an&rsquo; took it an&rsquo;  throwed
    it in the bushes a good way away from the camp, but next mornin&rsquo;, while
    we was havin&rsquo; breakfast, Billy Grimshaw got an idea, an&rsquo; arter
    breakfast he wetted a canvas bag he had an&rsquo; lit up his pipe, an&rsquo; went
    an&rsquo; got that there box o&rsquo; fish, an&rsquo; put it in the wet bag,
    an&rsquo; wrapped it tight round it an&rsquo; tied it up tight with string.
    Billy had a nipper of a nephew with him, about fourteen, named Tommy, an&rsquo; he
    was a sharp kid if ever there was one. So Billy says, &ldquo;Look here, Tommy,
    you take this fish up to Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s an&rsquo; tell her that Dave
    Regan sent &rsquo;em with his compliments, an&rsquo; he hopes she&rsquo;ll
    enjoy &rsquo;em. Tell her that Dave fetched &rsquo;em from Mudgee, but he&rsquo;s
    gone back to look for a pound note that he dropped out of a hole in his pocket
    somewheers along the road, an&rsquo; he asked you to take the fish up.&rdquo; So
    Tommy takes the fish an&rsquo; goes up to the house with &rsquo;em. When
    he come back he says that Mrs Hardwick smiled like a parson an&rsquo; give
    him a shillin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he didn&rsquo;t wait. We watched the
    house, an&rsquo; about half an hour arterwards we seen her run out of the
    kitchen with the open box in her hand, an&rsquo; run a good way away from
    the house an&rsquo; throw the fish inter the bushes, an&rsquo; then go back
    quick, holdin&rsquo; her nose.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; jest then, as luck would have it, we seen Dave Regan ridin&rsquo; up
    from the creek towards the house. He got down an&rsquo; went into the kitchen,
    an&rsquo;  then come backin&rsquo; out agen in a hurry with her in front
    of him. We could hear her voice from where we was, but we couldn&rsquo;t
    hear what she said. But we could see her arms wavin&rsquo; as if she was
    drivin&rsquo; fowls, an&rsquo; Dave backed all the way to his horse and gets
    on an&rsquo; comes ridin&rsquo; away quick, she screamin&rsquo; arter him
    all the time. When he got down opposite the camp we sung out to know what
    was the matter. &ldquo;What have you been doin&rsquo; to Mrs Hardwick, Dave?&rdquo; we
    says. &ldquo;We heerd her goin&rsquo; for yer proper jest now.&rdquo; &ldquo;Damned
    if I know,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t done nothin&rsquo; to her
    that I knows of. She&rsquo;s called me everything she can lay her tongue
    to, an&rsquo; she&rsquo;s ravin&rsquo; about my stinkin&rsquo; fish, or somethin&rsquo;.
    I can&rsquo;t make it out at all. I believe she&rsquo;s gone ratty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&nbsp;<i>must</i>&nbsp;have been doin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; to
    the woman,&rdquo; we says, &ldquo;or else she wouldn&rsquo;t have gone on
    at yer like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Dave swore he hadn&rsquo;t, an&rsquo; we talked it over for a while
    an&rsquo;  couldn&rsquo;t make head nor tail of it, an&rsquo; we come to
    the conclusion that it was only a touch o&rsquo; the sun.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Dave,&rdquo; we says. &ldquo;Go up agen in a day or two,
    when she&rsquo;s cooled down, an&rsquo; find out what the matter is. Or write
    to her. It might only have been someone makin&rsquo; mischief. That&rsquo;s
    what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Dave only sat an&rsquo; rubbed his head, an&rsquo; presently he started
    home to wherever he was hangin&rsquo; out. He wanted a quiet week to think.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her chimbly might have been smokin&rsquo;, Dave,&rdquo; we shouted
    arter him, but he was too dazed like to ketch on.</p>
  <p>Well, in a month or two we was campin&rsquo; there agen, an&rsquo; we found
    she&rsquo;d fenced in a lane to the crick she had no right to, an&rsquo; we
    had to take the bullicks a couple o&rsquo; miles round to grass an&rsquo; water.
    Well, the first mornin&rsquo; we seen her down in the corner of her paddick
    near the camp drivin&rsquo; some heifers, an&rsquo; Billy Grimshaw went up
    to the fence an&rsquo; spoke to her. Billy was the only one of us that dared
    face her and he was the only one she was ever civil to&mdash;p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
    because Billy had a squint an&rsquo; a wall eye and that put her out of countenance.</p>
  <p>Billy took off his hat very respectful an&rsquo; sings out, &ldquo;Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo; (It
    was Billy&rsquo;s bullicks she&rsquo;d &ldquo;pounded,&rdquo; by the way.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I want to speak to you, Mrs Hardwick,&rdquo; says Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, speak,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no time to waste
    talkin&rsquo; to bullick-drivers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is, Mrs Hardwick,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;that I
    want to explain somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; apologize for that young scamp
    of a nephew o&rsquo; mine, young Tommy. He ain&rsquo;t here or I&rsquo;d
    make him beg your pardon hisself, or I&rsquo;d cut him to pieces with the
    bullick-whip. I heard all about Dave Regan sendin&rsquo; you that stinkin&rsquo; fish,
    an&rsquo; I think it was a damned mean, dirty thing to do&mdash;to send stinkin&rsquo; fish
    to a woman, an&rsquo; especially to a widder an&rsquo; an unprotected woman
    like you, Mrs Hardwick. I&rsquo;ve had mothers an&rsquo; sisters of me own.
    An&rsquo; I want to tell you that I&rsquo;m sorry a relation o&rsquo; mine
    ever had anythin&rsquo; to do with it. As soon as I heerd of it I give young
    Tommy a lambastin&rsquo; he won&rsquo;t forgit in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did Tommy know the fish was bad?&rdquo; she says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter a rap,&rdquo; says Billy; &ldquo;he had no
    right to go takin&rsquo; messages from nobody to nobody.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Hardwick thought a while. Then she says: &ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps
    arter all Dave Regan didn&rsquo;t know the fish was bad. I&rsquo;ve often
    thought I might have been in too much of a hurry. Things goes bad so quick
    out here in this weather. An&rsquo;  Dave was always very friendly. I can&rsquo;t
    understand why he&rsquo;d do a dirty thing on me like that. I never done
    anything to Dave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now I forgot to tell you that Billy had a notion that Dave helped drive
    his bullicks to pound that time, though I didn&rsquo;t believe it. So Billy
    says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that for a minute, Mrs Hardwick. Dave knew
    what he was a-doin&rsquo; of all right; an&rsquo; if I ketch him I&rsquo;ll
    give him a beltin&rsquo; for it if no one else is man enough to stand up
    for a woman!&rdquo; says Billy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;yer know Dave knew?&rdquo; says Mrs Hardwick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know!&rdquo; says Billy. &ldquo;Why, he talked about it all over
    the district. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she screamed out, an&rsquo; I moved away from that there
    fence, for she had a stick to drive them heifers with. But Billy stood his
    ground. &ldquo;Is that the truth, Billy Grimshaw?&rdquo; she screams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take me oath on it. He blowed
    about it all over the district, as if it was very funny, an&rsquo; he says&mdash;&rdquo; An&rsquo; Billy
    stopped.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she shouted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;that I hardly like to
    tell it to a lady. I wouldn&rsquo;t like to tell yer, Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have to tell me, Billy Grimshaw,&rdquo; she screams. &ldquo;I
    have a right to know. If you don&rsquo;t tell me I&rsquo;ll pull him next
    week an&rsquo; have it dragged out of you in the witness-box!&rdquo; she
    says. &ldquo;An&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll have satisfaction out of him in the felon&rsquo;s
    dock of a court of law!&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What did the villain say?&rdquo; she
    screams.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;if yer must have it&mdash;an&rsquo;,
    anyway, I&rsquo;m hanged if I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to stand by an&rsquo; see
    a woman scandalized behind her back&mdash;if yer must have it I&rsquo;ll
    tell yer. Dave said that the fish didn&rsquo;t smell no worse than your place
    anyway.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We got away from there then. She cut up too rough altogether. I can&rsquo;t
    tell you what she said&mdash;I ain&rsquo;t got the words. She went up to
    the house, an&rsquo; we seen the farm-hand harnessin&rsquo; up the horse,
    an&rsquo; we reckoned she was goin&rsquo; to drive into town straight away
    an&rsquo; take out a summons agenst Dave Regan. An&rsquo; jest then Dave
    hisself comes ridin&rsquo; past&mdash;jest when he was most wanted, as usual.
    He always rode fast past Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s nowadays, an&rsquo; never stopped
    there, but Billy shouted after him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo, Dave! I want to speak to yer,&rdquo; shouts Billy. An&rsquo; Dave
    yanks his horse round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, Billy?&rdquo; he says.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Dave,&rdquo; says Billy. &ldquo;You had your little joke
    about the chimbly, an&rsquo; we had our little joke about the fish an&rsquo; Mrs
    Hardwick, so now we&rsquo;ll call it quits. A joke&rsquo;s a joke, but it
    can go too far, an&rsquo; this one&rsquo;s gettin&rsquo; too red-hot altogether.
    So we&rsquo;ve fixed it up with Mrs Hardwick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What fish an&rsquo; what joke?&rdquo; says Dave, rubbin&rsquo; his
    head. &ldquo;An&rsquo; what have yer fixed up with Mrs Hardwick? Whatever
    are yer talkin&rsquo; about, Billy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So Billy told him all about us sendin&rsquo; the stinkin&rsquo; fish to
    Mrs Hardwick by Tommy, an&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; Dave sent &rsquo;em&mdash;Dave
    rubbin&rsquo; the back of his neck an&rsquo; starin&rsquo; at Billy all the
    time. &ldquo;An&rdquo; now,&rdquo; says Billy, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say anything
    about them bullicks; but I went up and seen Mrs Hardwick this mornin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo; told her the whole truth about them fish, an&rsquo; how you knowed
    nothin&rsquo; about it, an&rsquo; I apologized an&rsquo; told her we was
    very sorry; an&rsquo; she says she was very sorry too on your account, an&rsquo; wanted
    to see yer. I promised to tell yer as soon as I seen yer. It ought to be
    fixed up. You ought to go right up to the house an&rsquo;  see her now. She&rsquo;s
    awfully cut up about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; says Dave, brightenin&rsquo; up. &ldquo;It was
    a dirty, mean trick anyway to play on a cove; but I&rsquo;ll go up an&rsquo; see
    her.&rdquo; An&rsquo; he went there  &lsquo;n&rsquo; then.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; about fifteen minutes arterwards he comes boltin&rsquo; back from
    the house one way an&rsquo; his horse the other. The horse acted as if it
    had a big scare, an&rsquo; so did Dave. Billy went an&rsquo; ketched Dave&rsquo;s
    horse for him, an&rsquo; I got Dave a towel to wipe the dirty dish-water
    off of his face an&rsquo; out of his hair an&rsquo; collar, an&rsquo; I give
    him a piece of soap to rub on the places where he&rsquo;d been scalded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, the woman must be ravin&rsquo; mad,&rdquo; I says. &ldquo;Whatever
    did yer say to her this time, Dave? Yer allers gettin&rsquo; inter hot water
    with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say nothin&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Dave. &ldquo;I jest
    went up laughin&rsquo; like, an&rsquo; says, &lsquo;How are yer, Mrs Hardwick?&rsquo; an&rsquo; she
    ups an&rsquo; lets me have a dish of dirty wash-up water, an&rsquo; then
    on top of that she let fly with a dipper of scaldin&rsquo;-hot, greasy water
    outer the boiler. She&rsquo;s gone clean ravin&rsquo; mad, I think.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s as mad as a hatter, right enough, Dave,&rdquo; says Billy
    Grimshaw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you go there no more, Dave, it ain&rsquo;t safe.&rdquo; An&rsquo; we
    lent Dave a hat an&rsquo; a clean shirt, an&rsquo; he went on inter town. &ldquo;You
    ought to have humoured her,&rdquo; says Billy, as Dave rode away. &ldquo;You
    ought to have told her to put a wet bag over her chimbly an&rsquo; hang the
    fish inside to smoke.&rdquo; But Dave was too stunned to ketch on. He went
    on inter the town an&rsquo; got on a howlin&rsquo; spree. An&rsquo;  while
    he was soberin&rsquo; up the thing began to dawn on him. An&rsquo; the nex&rsquo; time
    he met Billy they had a fight. An&rsquo; Dave got another woman to speak
    to Mrs Hardwick, an&rsquo; Mrs Hardwick ketched young Tommy goin&rsquo; past
    her place one day an&rsquo;  bailed him up an&rsquo; scared the truth out
    of him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; she says to him, &ldquo;I want the truth, the whole
    truth, an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but the truth about them fish, an&rsquo; if
    I don&rsquo;t get it outer you I&rsquo;ll wring her young neck for tryin&rsquo; to
    poison me, an&rsquo; save yer from the gallust!&rdquo;  she says to Tommy.</p>
  <p>So he told her the whole truth, swelp him, an&rsquo; got away; an&rsquo; he
    respected Mrs Hardwick arter that.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; next time we come past with the teams we seen Dave&rsquo;s horse
    hangin&rsquo; up outside Mrs Hardwick&rsquo;s, an&rsquo; we went some miles
    further along the road an&rsquo; camped in a new place where we&rsquo;d be
    more comfortable. An&rsquo; ever arter that we used to always whip up an&rsquo; drive
    past her place as if we didn&rsquo;t know her.</p>

      Gather at the River?&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">Told By Joe Wilson </p>
  <p class="note">God&rsquo;s preacher, of churches unheeded,<br>
    God&rsquo;s vineyard, though barren the sod,<br>
    Plain spokesman where spokesman is needed,<br>
    Rough link &rsquo;twixt the Bushman and God.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The
  Christ of the Never.</i></p>
  <p>I&nbsp;never&nbsp;told you about Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan. He was a sort of
    bush missionary up-country and out back in Australia, and before he died
    he was known from Riverina down south in New South Wales to away up through
    the Never-Never country in western Queensland.</p>
  <p>His past was a mystery, so, of course, there were all sorts of yarns about
    him. He was supposed to be a Scotchman from London, and some said that he
    had got into trouble in his young days and had had to clear out of the old
    country; or, at least, that he had been a ne&rsquo;e-er-do-well and had been
    sent out to Australia on the remittance system. Some said he&rsquo;d studied
    for the law, some said he&rsquo;d studied for a doctor, while others believed
    that he was, or had been, an ordained minister. I remember one man who swore
    (when he was drinking) that he had known Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan as a medical
    student in a big London hospital, and that he had started in practice for
    himself somewhere near Gray&rsquo;s Inn Road in London. Anyway, as I got
    to know him he struck me as being a man who had looked into the eyes of so
    much misery in his life that some of it had got into his own.</p>
  <p>He was a tall man, straight and well built, and about forty or forty-five,
    when I first saw him. He had wavy dark hair, and a close, curly beard. I
    once heard a woman say that he had a beard like you see in some Bible pictures
    of Christ. Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan seldom smiled; there was something in his
    big dark brown eyes that was scarcely misery, nor yet sadness&mdash;a sort
    of haunted sympathy.</p>
  <p>He must have had money, or else he got remittances from home, for he paid
    his way and helped many a poor devil. They said that he gave away most of
    his money. Sometimes he worked for a while himself as bookkeeper at a shearing-shed,
    wool-sorter, shearer, even rouseabout; he&rsquo;d work at anything a bushman
    could get to do. Then he&rsquo;d go out back to God-forgotten districts and
    preach to bushmen in one place, and get a few children together in another
    and teach them to read. He could take his drink, and swear a little when
    he thought it necessary. On one occasion, at a rough shearing-shed, he called
    his beloved brethren &ldquo;damned fools&rdquo; for drinking their cheques.</p>
  <p>Towards the end of his life if he went into a &ldquo;rough&rdquo; shed or
    shanty west of the Darling River&mdash;and some of them were rough&mdash;there
    would be a rest in the language and drinking, even a fight would be interrupted,
    and there would be more than one who would lift their hats to Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.
    A bushman very rarely lifts his hat to a man, yet the worst characters of
    the West have listened bareheaded to Peter when he preached.</p>
  <p>It was said in our district that Peter only needed to hint to the squatter
    that he wanted fifty or a hundred pounds to help someone or something, and
    the squatter would give it to him without question or hesitation.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d nurse sick boundary-riders, shearers, and station-hands, often
    sitting in the desolate hut by the bedside of a sick man night after night.
    And, if he had time, he&rsquo;d look up the local blacks and see how they
    were getting on. Once, on a far out back sheep station, he sat for three
    nights running, by the bedside of a young Englishman, a B.A. they said he
    was, who&rsquo;d been employed as tutor at the homestead and who died a wreck,
    the result of five years of life in London and Paris. The poor fellow was
    only thirty. And the last few hours of his life he talked to Peter in French,
    nothing but French. Peter understood French and one or two other languages,
    besides English and Australian; but whether the young wreck was raving or
    telling the story of a love, or his life, none of us ever knew, for Peter
    never spoke of it. But they said that at the funeral Peter&rsquo;s eyes seemed
    haunted more than usual.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the yarn about Peter and the dying cattle at Piora Station
    one terrible drought, when the surface was as bare as your hand for hundreds
    of miles, and the heat like the breath of a furnace, and the sheep and cattle
    were perishing by thousands. Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan was out on the run helping
    the station-hands to pull out cattle that had got bogged in the muddy waterholes
    and were too weak to drag themselves out, when, about dusk, a gentlemanly  &ldquo;piano-fingered&rdquo; parson,
    who had come to the station from the next town, drove out in his buggy to
    see the men. He spoke to Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you not think we should offer
    up a prayer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Peter, standing in his shirt sleeves, a rope
    in his hands and mud from head to foot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For? Why, for rain, brother,&rdquo; replied the parson, a bit surprised.</p>
  <p>Peter held up his finger and said &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Now, with a big mob of travelling stock camped on the plain at night, there
    is always a lowing, soughing or moaning sound, a sound like that of the sea
    on the shore at a little distance; and, altogether, it might be called the
    sigh or yawn of a big mob in camp. But the long, low moaning of cattle dying
    of hunger and thirst on the hot barren plain in a drought is altogether different,
    and, at night, there is something awful about it&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t
    describe it. This is what Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan heard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you hear that?&rdquo; he asked the other preacher.</p>
  <p>The little parson said he did. Perhaps he only heard the weak lowing of
    cattle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think that God will hear us when He does not hear that?&rdquo;  asked
    Peter.</p>
  <p>The parson stared at him for a moment and then got into his buggy and drove
    away, greatly shocked and deeply offended. But, later on, over tea at the
    homestead, he said that he felt sure that that &ldquo;unfortunate man,&rdquo; Peter
    M&lsquo;Laughlan, was not in his right mind; that his wandering, irregular
    life, or the heat, must have affected him.</p>
  <p>I well remember the day when I first heard Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan preach.
    I was about seventeen then. We used sometimes to attend service held on Sunday
    afternoon, about once a month, in a little slab-and-bark school-house in
    the scrub off the main road, three miles or so from our selection, in a barren
    hole amongst the western ridges of the Great Dividing Range. School was held
    in this hut for a few weeks or a few months now and again, when a teacher
    could be got to stay there and teach, and cook for himself, for a pound a
    week, more or less contributed by the parents. A parson from the farming
    town to the east, or the pastoral town over the ridges to the west, used
    to come in his buggy when it didn&rsquo;t rain and wasn&rsquo;t too hot to
    hold the service.</p>
  <p>I remember this Sunday. It was a blazing hot day towards the end of a long
    and fearful drought which ruined many round there. The parson was expected,
    and a good few had come to &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; in spring-carts, on horseback,
    and on foot; farmers and their wives and sons and daughters. The children
    had been brought here to Sunday-school, taught by some of the girls, in the
    morning. I can see it all now quite plain: The one-roomed hut, for it was
    no more, with the stunted blue-grey gum scrub all round. The white, dusty
    road, so hot that you could cook eggs in the dust. The horses tied up, across
    the road, in the supposed shade under clumps of scraggy saplings along by
    the fence of a cattle-run. The little crowd outside the hut: selectors in
    washed and mended tweeds, some with paper collars, some wearing starched
    and ironed white coats, and in blucher boots, greased or blackened, or the
    young men wearing &ldquo;larstins&rdquo;  (elastic-side boots). The women
    and girls in prints and cottons (or cheap  &ldquo;alpaca,&rdquo; etc.), and
    a bright bit of ribbon here and there amongst the girls. The white heat blazed
    everywhere, and &ldquo;dazzled&rdquo; across light-coloured surfaces&mdash;dead
    white trees, fence-posts, and sand-heaps, like an endless swarm of bees passing
    in the sun&rsquo;s glare. And over above the dry box-scrub-covered ridges,
    the great Granite Peak, glaring like a molten mass.</p>
  <p>The people didn&rsquo;t like to go inside out of the heat and sit down before
    the minister came. The wretched hut was a rough school, sometimes with a
    clay fire-place where the teacher cooked, and a corner screened off with
    sacking where he had his bunk; it was a camp for tramps at other times, or
    lizards and possums, but to-day it was a house of God, and as such the people
    respected it.</p>
  <p>The town parson didn&rsquo;t turn up. Perhaps he was unwell, or maybe the
    hot, dusty ten-mile drive was too much for him to face. One of the farmers,
    who had tried to conduct service on a previous occasion on which the ordained
    minister had failed us, had broken down in the middle of it, so he was out
    of the question. We waited for about an hour, and then who should happen
    to ride along but Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, and one or two of the elder men
    asked him to hold service. He was on his way to see a sick friend at a sheep
    station over the ridges, but he said that he could spare an hour or two.
    (Nearly every man who was sick, either in stomach or pocket, was a friend
    of Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.) Peter tied up his horse under a bush shed at
    the back of the hut, and we followed him in.</p>
  <p>The &ldquo;school&rdquo; had been furnished with a rough deal table and
    a wooden chair for &ldquo;the teacher,&rdquo; and with a few rickety desks
    and stools cadged from an old &ldquo;provisional&rdquo; school in town when
    the new public school was built; and the desks and stools had been fastened
    to the floor to strengthen them; they had been made for &ldquo;infant&rdquo; classes,
    and youth out our way ran to length. But when grown men over six feet high
    squeezed in behind the desks and sat down on the stools the effect struck
    me as being ridiculous. In fact, I am afraid that on the first occasion it
    rather took my attention from the sermon, and I remember being made very
    uncomfortable by a school chum., Jack Barnes, who took a delight in catching
    my eye and winking or grinning. He could wink without changing a solemn line
    in his face and grin without exploding, and I couldn&rsquo;t. The boys usually
    sat on seats, slabs on blocks of wood, along the wall at the far end of the
    room, which was comfortable, for they had a rest for their backs. One or
    two of the boys were nearing six feet high, so they could almost rest their
    chins on their knees as they sat. But I squatted with some of my tribe on
    a stool along the wall by the teacher&rsquo;s table, and so could see most
    of the congregation.</p>
  <p>Above us bare tie-beams and the round sapling rafters (with the bark still
    on), and the inner sides of the sheets of stringybark that formed the roof.
    The slabs had been lined with sacking at one time, but most of it had fallen
    or dry-rotted away; there were wide cracks between the slabs and we could
    see the white glare of sunlight outside, with a strip of dark shade, like
    a deep trench in the white ground, by the back wall. Someone had brought
    a canvas water-bag and hung it to the beams on the other side of the minister&rsquo;s
    table, with a pint-pot over the tap, and the drip, drip from the bag made
    the whole place seem cooler.</p>
  <p>I studied Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan first. He was dressed in washed and mended
    tweed vest and trousers, and had on a long, lightcoloured coat of a material
    which we called &ldquo;Chinese silk.&rdquo; He wore a &ldquo;soft&rdquo; cotton
    shirt with collar attached, and blucher boots.</p>
  <p>He gave out a hymn in his quiet, natural way, said a prayer, gave out another
    hymn, read a chapter from the Bible, and then gave out another hymn. They
    liked to sing, out in those places. The Southwicks used to bring a cranky
    little harmonium in the back of their old dog-cart, and Clara Southwick used
    to accompany the hymns. She was a very pretty girl, fair, and could play
    and sing well. I used to think she had the sweetest voice I ever heard. But&mdash;ah,
    well&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Peter didn&rsquo;t sing himself, at first. I got an idea that he couldn&rsquo;t.
    While they were singing he stood loosely, with one hand in his trouser-pocket,
    scratching his beard with his hymn-book, and looking as if he were thinking
    things over, and only rousing himself to give another verse. He forgot to
    give it once or twice, but we got through all right. I noticed the wife of
    one of the men who had asked Peter to preach looking rather black at her
    husband, and I reckoned that he&rsquo;d get it hotter than the weather on
    the way home.</p>
  <p>Then Peter stood up and commenced to preach. He stood with both hands in
    his pockets, at first, his coat ruffled back, and there was the stem of a
    clay pipe sticking out of his waistcoatpocket. The pipe fascinated me for
    a while, but after that I forgot the pipe and was fascinated by the man.
    Peter&rsquo;s face was one that didn&rsquo;t strike you at first with its
    full strength, it grew on you; it grew on me, and before he had done preaching
    I thought it was the noblest face I had ever seen.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t preach much of hope in this world. How could he? The drought
    had been blazing over these districts for nearly a year, with only a shower
    now and again, which was a mockery&mdash;scarcely darkening the baked ground.
    Wheat crops came up a few inches and were parched by the sun or mown for
    hay, or the cattle turned on them; and last year there had been rust and
    smut in the wheat. And, on top of it all, the dreadful cattle plague, pleuro-pneumonia,
    had somehow been introduced into the district. One big farmer had lost fifty
    milkers in a week.</p>
  <p>Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan didn&rsquo;t preach much of hope in this world; how
    could he? There were men there who had slaved for twenty, thirty, forty years;
    worked as farmers have to work in few other lands&mdash;first to clear the
    stubborn bush from the barren soil, then to fence the ground, and manure
    it, and force crops from it&mdash;and for what? There was Cox, the farmer,
    starved off his selection after thirty years and going out back with his
    drays to work at tank-sinking for a squatter. There was his eldest son going
    shearing or droving&mdash;anything he could get to do&mdash;a stoop-shouldered,
    young-old man of thirty. And behind them, in the end, would be a dusty patch
    in the scrub, a fencepost here and there, and a pile of chimney-stones and
    a hardwood slab or two where the hut was&mdash;for thirty hard years of the
    father&rsquo;s life and twenty of the son&rsquo;s.</p>
  <p>I forget Peter&rsquo;s text, if he had a text; but the gist of his sermon
    was that there was a God&mdash;there was a heaven! And there were men there
    listening who needed to believe these things. There was old Ross from across
    the creek, old, but not sixty, a hard man. Only last week he had broken down
    and fallen on his knees on the baked sods in the middle of his ploughed ground
    and prayed for rain. His frightened boys had taken him home, and later on,
    the same afternoon, when they brought news of four more cows down with &ldquo;the
    pleuro&rdquo;  in an outer paddock, he had stood up outside his own door
    and shaken his fist at the brassy sky and cursed high heaven to the terror
    of his family, till his brave, sun-browned wife dragged him inside and soothed
    him. And Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan knew all about this.</p>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s family had the doctor out to him, and persuaded him to come
    to church this Sunday. The old man sat on the front seat, stooping forward,
    with his elbow resting on the desk and his chin on his hand, bunching up
    his beard over his mouth with his fingers and staring gloomily at Peter with
    dark, piercing eyes from under bushy eyebrows, just as I&rsquo;ve since seen
    a Scotchman stare at Max O&rsquo;Rell all through a humorous lecture called &ldquo;A
    nicht wi&rsquo; Sandy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ross&rsquo;s right hand resting on the desk was very eloquent horny, scarred
    and knotted at every joint, with broken, twisted nails, and nearly closed,
    as though fitted to the handle of an axe or a spade. Ross was an educated
    man (he had a regular library of books at home), and perhaps that&rsquo;s
    why he suffered so much.</p>
  <p>Peter preached as if he were speaking quietly to one person only, but every
    word was plain and every sentence went straight to someone. I believe he
    looked every soul in the eyes before he had done. Once he said something
    and caught my eye, and I felt a sudden lump in my throat. There was a boy
    there, a pale, thin, sensitive boy who was eating his heart out because of
    things he didn&rsquo;t understand. He was ambitious and longed for something
    different from this life; he&rsquo;d written a story or two and some rhymes
    for the local paper; his companions considered him a &ldquo;bit ratty&rdquo; and
    the grown-up people thought him a  &ldquo;bit wrong in his head,&rdquo; idiotic,
    or at least &ldquo;queer.&rdquo; And during his sermon Peter spoke of &ldquo;unsatisfied
    longings,&rdquo; of the hope of something better, and said that one had to
    suffer much and for long years before he could preach or write; and then
    he looked at that boy. I knew the boy very well; he has risen in the world
    since then.</p>
  <p>Peter spoke of the life we lived, of the things we knew, and used names
    and terms that we used. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether it was a blanky
    sermon or a blanky lecture,&rdquo; said long swanky Jim Bullock afterwards, &ldquo;but
    it was straight and hit some of us hard. It hit me once or twice, I can tell
    yer.&rdquo; Peter spoke of our lives: &ldquo;And there is beauty&mdash;even
    in this life and in this place,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nothing is wasted&mdash;nothing
    is without reason. There is beauty even in this place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I noticed something like a hint of a hard smile on Ross&rsquo;s face; he
    moved the hand on the desk and tightened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, as if in answer to Ross&rsquo;s expression
    and the movement of his hand, &ldquo;there is beauty in this life here. After
    a good season, and when the bush is tall and dry, when the bush-fires threaten
    a man&rsquo;s crop of ripened wheat, there are tired men who run and ride
    from miles round to help that man, and who fight the fire all night to save
    his wheat&mdash;and some of them may have been wrangling with him for years.
    And in the morning, when the wheat is saved and the danger is past, when
    the fire is beaten out or turned, there are blackened, grimy hands that come
    together and grip&mdash;hands that have not joined for many a long day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Palmer, Ross&rsquo;s neighbour, moved uneasily. He had once helped Ross
    to put a fire out, but they had quarrelled again since. Ross still sat in
    the same position, looking the hard man he was. Peter glanced at Ross, looked
    down and thought a while, and then went on again:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. When a man loses
    his farm, or his stock, or his crop, through no fault of his own, there are
    poor men who put their hands into their pockets to help him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Kurtz, over the ridge, had had his stacked crop of wheat in sheaf burned&mdash;some
    scoundrel had put a match to it at night&mdash;and the farmers round had
    collected nearly fifty pounds for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. In the blazing
    drought, when the cattle lie down and cannot rise from weakness, neighbours
    help neighbours to lift them. When one man has hay or chaff and no stock,
    he gives it or sells it cheaply to the poor man who has starving cattle and
    no fodder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I only knew one or two instances of this kind; but Peter was preaching of
    what man should do as well as what they did.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When a man meets with an accident, or dies, there are young men who
    go with their ploughs and horses and plough the ground for him or his widow
    and put in the crop.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock and one or two other young men squirmed. They had ploughed old
    Leonard&rsquo;s land for him when he met with an accident in the shape of
    a broken leg got by a kick from a horse. They had also ploughed the ground
    for Mrs Phipps when her husband died, working, by the way, all Saturday afternoon
    and Sunday, for they were very busy at home at that time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There is beauty even in this life and in this place. There are women
    who were friends in girlhood and who quarrelled bitterly over a careless
    word, an idle tale, or some paltry thing, who live within a mile of each
    other and have not spoken for years; yet let one fall ill, or lose husband
    or child, and the other will hurry across to her place and take off her bonnet
    and tuck up her sleeves, and set to work to help straighten things, and they
    will kiss, and cry in each other&rsquo;s arms, and be sisters again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I saw tears in the eyes of two hard and hard-faced women I knew; but they
    were smiling to each other through their tears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I want to talk to you about some
    other things. I am not preaching as a man who has been taught to preach comfortably,
    but as a man who has learned in the world&rsquo;s school. I know what trouble
    is. Men,&rdquo; he said, still speaking quietly, &ldquo;and women too! I
    have been through trouble as deep as any of yours&mdash;perhaps deeper. I
    know how you toil and suffer, I know what battles you fight, I know. I too
    fought a battle, perhaps as hard as any you fight. I carry a load and am
    fighting a battle still.&rdquo; His eyes were very haggard just them. &ldquo;But
    this is not what I wanted to talk to you about. I have nothing to say against
    a young man going away from this place to better himself, but there are young
    men who go out back shearing or droving, young men who are goodhearted but
    careless, who make cheques, and spend their money gambling or drinking and
    never think of the old folk at home until it is too late. They never think
    of the old people, alone, perhaps, in a desolate hut on a worked-out farm
    in the scrub.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim Bullock squirmed again. He had gone out back last season and made a
    cheque, and lost most of it on horse-racing and cards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They never think&mdash;they cannot think how, perhaps, long years
    agone in the old days, the old father, as a young man, and his brave young
    wife, came out here and buried themselves in the lonely bush and toiled for
    many years, trying&mdash;it does not matter whether they failed or not&mdash;trying
    to make homes for their children; toiled till the young man was bowed and
    grey, and the young wife brown and wrinkled and worn out. Exiles they were
    in the early days&mdash;boy-husbands and girl-wives some of them, who left
    their native lands, who left all that was dear, that seemed beautiful, that
    seemed to make life worth living, and sacrificed their young lives in drought
    and utter loneliness to make homes for their children. I want you young men
    to think of this. Some of them came from England, Ireland, Bonnie Scotland.&rdquo; Ross
    straightened up and let his hands fall loosely on his knees. &ldquo;Some
    from Europe&mdash;your foreign fathers&mdash;some from across the Rhine in
    Germany.&rdquo; We looked at old Kurtz. He seemed affected.</p>
  <p>Then Peter paused for a moment and blinked thoughtfully at Ross, then he
    took a drink of water. I can see now that the whole thing was a battle between
    Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and Robert Ross&mdash;Scot met Scot. &ldquo;It seemed
    to me,&rdquo; Jim Bullock said afterwards, &ldquo;that Peter was only tryin&rsquo; to
    make some of us blanky well blubber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And there are men,&rdquo; Peter went on, &ldquo;who have struggled
    and suffered and failed, and who have fought and failed again till their
    tempers are spoiled, until they grow bitter. They go in for self-pity, and
    self-pity leads to moping and brooding and madness; self-pity is the most
    selfish and useless thing on the face of God&rsquo;s earth. It is cruel,
    it is deadly, both to the man and to those who love him, and whom he ought
    to love. His load grows heavier daily in his imagination, and he sinks down
    until it is in him to curse God and die. He ceases to care for or to think
    of his children who are working to help him.&rdquo; (Ross&rsquo;s sons were
    good, steady, hard-working boys.) &ldquo;Or the brave wife who has been so
    true to him for many hard years, who left home and friends and country for
    his sake. Who bears up in the blackest of times, and persists in looking
    at the bright side of things for his sake; who has suffered more than he
    if he only knew it, and suffers now, through him and because of him, but
    who is patient and bright and cheerful while her heart is breaking. He thinks
    she does not suffer, that she cannot suffer as a man does. My God! he doesn&rsquo;t
    know. He has forgotten in her the bright, fresh-faced, loving lassie he loved
    and won long years agone&mdash;long years agone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a sob, like the sob of an over-ridden horse as it sinks down broken-hearted,
    and Ross&rsquo;s arms went out on the desk in front of him, and his head
    went down on them. He was beaten.</p>
  <p>He was steered out gently with his wife on one side of him and his eldest
    son on the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be alarmed, my friends,&rdquo; said Peter, standing by
    the water-bag with one hand on the tap and the pannikin in the other. &ldquo;Mr
    Ross has not been well lately, and the heat has been too much for him.&rdquo; And
    he went out after Ross. They took him round under the bush shed behind the
    hut, where it was cooler.</p>
  <p>When Peter came back to his place he seemed to have changed his whole manner
    and tone. &ldquo;Our friend, Mr Ross, is much better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
    will now sing&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced at Clara Southwick at the harmonium&mdash;&ldquo;we
    will now sing  &lsquo;Shall We Gather at the River?&rsquo;&rdquo; We all
    knew that hymn; it was an old favourite round there, and Clara Southwick
    played it well in spite of the harmonium.</p>
  <p>And Peter sang&mdash;the first and last time I ever heard him sing. I never
    had an ear for music; but I never before nor since heard a man&rsquo;s voice
    that stirred me as Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&rsquo;s. We stood like emus, listening
    to him all through one verse, then we pulled ourselves together.</p>
  <p class="note">Shall we gather at the River,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where bright angels&rsquo; feet have trod&mdash;</p>
  <p>The only rivers round there were barren creeks, the best of them only strings
    of muddy waterholes, and across the ridge, on the sheep-runs, the creeks
    were dry gutters, with baked banks and beds, and perhaps a mudhole every
    mile or so, and dead beasts rotting and stinking every few yards.</p>
  <p class="note">Gather with the saints at the River,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows by the throne of God.</p>
  <p>Peter&rsquo;s voice trembled and broke. He caught his breath, and his eyes
    filled. But he smiled then&mdash;he stood smiling at us through his tears.</p>
  <p class="note">The beautiful, the beautiful River, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows by the throne of God.</p>
  <p>Outside I saw women kiss each other who had been at daggers drawn ever since
    I could remember, and men shake hands silently who had hated each other for
    years. Every family wanted Peter to come home to tea, but he went across
    to Ross&rsquo;s, and afterwards down to Kurtz&rsquo;s place, and bled and
    inoculated six cows or so in a new way, and after tea he rode off over the
    gap to see his friend.</p>

  <p>I&nbsp;told&nbsp;you about Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, the bush missionary,
    and how he preached in the little slab-and-bark school-house in the scrub
    on Ross&rsquo;s Creek that blazing hot Sunday afternoon long ago, when the
    drought was ruining the brave farmers all round there and breaking their
    hearts. And how hard old Ross, the selector, broke down at the end of the
    sermon, and blubbered, and had to be taken out of church.</p>
  <p>I left home and drifted to Sydney, and &ldquo;back into the Great North-West
    where all the rovers go,&rdquo; and knocked about the country for six or
    seven years before I met Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan again. I was young yet, but
    felt old at times, and there were times, in the hot, rough, greasy shearing-shed
    on blazing days, or in the bare &ldquo;men&rsquo;s hut&rdquo; by the flicker
    of the stinking slushlamp at night, or the wretched wayside shanty with its
    drinkmadness and blasphemy, or tramping along the dusty, endless track&mdash;there
    were times when I wished I could fall back with all the experience I&rsquo;d
    got, and sit once more in the little slab-and-bark &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; on
    Ross&rsquo;s Creek and hear Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and the poor, struggling
    selectors sing &ldquo;Shall We Gather at the River?&rdquo; and then go out
    and start life afresh.</p>
  <p>My old school chum and bush mate, Jack Barnes, had married pretty little
    Clara Southwick, who used to play the portable harmonium in chapel. I nearly
    broke my heart when they were married, but then I was a young fool. Clara
    was a year or so older than I, and I could never get away from a boyish feeling
    of reverence for her, as if she were something above and out of my world.
    And so, while I was worshipping her in chapel once a month, and at picnics
    and parties in between, and always at a distance, Jack used to ride up to
    Southwick&rsquo;s place on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and on other days,
    and hang his horse up outside, or turn it in the paddock, and argue with
    old Southwick, and agree with the old woman, and court Clara on the sly.
    And he got her.</p>
  <p>It was at their wedding that I first got the worse for drink.</p>
  <p>Jack was a blue-eyed, curly black-haired, careless, popular young scamp;
    as good-hearted as he was careless. He could ride like a circus monkey, do
    all kinds of bush work, add two columns of figures at once, and write like
    copper-plate.</p>
  <p>Jack was given to drinking, gambling and roving. He steadied up when he
    got married and started on a small selection of his own; but within the year
    Clara was living in a back skillion of her father&rsquo;s house and Jack
    was up-country shearing. He was &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; of the shed at Piora
    Station one season and made a decent cheque; and within a fortnight after
    the shed &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; he turned up at home in a very bad state from
    drink and with about thirty shillings in his pockets. He had fallen from
    his horse in the creek near Southwick&rsquo;s, and altogether he was a nice
    sort of young husband to go home to poor, heart-broken Clara.</p>
  <p>I remember that time well. She stopped me one day as I was riding past to
    ask me if I&rsquo;d seen Jack, and I got off my horse. Her chin and mouth
    began to twitch and tremble and I saw her eyes filling with tears. She laid
    her hand on my arm and asked me to promise not to drink with Jack if I met
    him, but to try and persuade him to come home. And&mdash;well, have you,
    as a man, ever, with the one woman that you can&rsquo;t have, and no matter
    at what time or place, felt a sudden mad longing to take her in your arms
    and kiss her&mdash;and damn the world? I got on my horse again. She must
    have thought me an ignorant brute, but I felt safer there. And when I thought
    how I had nearly made a fool of myself, and been a cowardly brute, and a
    rotten mate to my mate, I rode ten miles to find Jack and get him home.</p>
  <p>He straightened up again after a bit and went out and got another shed,
    and they say that Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan got hold of him there. I don&rsquo;t
    know what Peter did to him then&mdash;Jack never spoke of it, even to me,
    his old mate; but, anyway, at the end of the shearing season Jack&rsquo;s
    cheque came home to Clara in a registered envelope, addressed in Peter&rsquo;s
    hand-writing, and about a week later Jack turned up a changed man.</p>
  <p>He got work as a temporary clerk in the branch government land office at
    Solong, a pretty little farming town in a circle of blue hills on the banks
    of a clear, willow-fringed river, where there were rich, black-soil, river-flat
    farms, and vineyards on the red soil slopes, and blue peaks in the distance.
    It was a great contrast to Ross&rsquo;s Creek. Jack paid a deposit on an
    allotment of land, a bit out of town, on the river bank, and built a little
    weather-board box of a cottage in spare times, and planted roses and grape-vines
    to hide its ugliness by and by. It wasn&rsquo;t much of a place, but Clara
    was mighty proud of it because it was &ldquo;our house.&rdquo; They were
    very happy, and she was beginning to feel sure of Jack. She seemed to believe
    that the miserable old time was all past and gone.</p>
  <p>When the work at the land&rsquo;s office gave out, Jack did all sorts of
    jobs about town, and at last, one shearing season, when there was a heavy
    clip of wool, and shearers were getting &pound;1. a hundred, he decided to
    go out back. I know that Clara was against it, but he argued that it was
    the only chance for him, and she persuaded herself that she could trust him.
    I was knocking about Solong at the time, and Jack and I decided to go out
    together and share his packhorse between us. He wrote to Beenaway Shed, about
    three hundred miles north-west in the Great Scrubs, and got pens for both
    of us.</p>
  <p>It was a fine fresh morning when we started; it was in a good season and
    the country looked grand. When I rode up to Jack&rsquo;s place I saw his
    horse and packhorse tied up outside the gate. He had wanted me to come up
    the evening before and have tea with them and camp at his place for the night. &ldquo;Come
    up! man alive!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo; We&rsquo;ll make you a shake-down!&rdquo; But
    I wouldn&rsquo;t; I said I had to meet a chap. Jack wouldn&rsquo;t have understood.
    I had been up before, but when I saw him and Clara so happy and comfortable,
    and thought of the past and my secret, and thought of myself, a useless,
    purposeless, restless, homeless sort of fellow, hanging out at a boarding-house,
    it nearly broke me up, and I had to have a drink or two afterwards. I often
    wonder if Clara guessed and understood. You never know how much a woman knows;
    but&mdash;ah, well!</p>
  <p>Jack had taken my things home with him and he and Clara had packed them.
    I found afterwards that she had washed, dried and ironed some collars and
    handkerchiefs of mine during the night. Clara and Jack came out to the gate,
    and as I wouldn&rsquo;t go in to have a cup of tea there was nothing for
    it but to say good-bye. She was dressed in a fresh-looking print blouse and
    dark skirt, and wore a white hood that fell back from her head; she was a
    little girl, with sweet, small, freckled features, and red-gold hair, and
    kind, sympathetic grey eyes. I thought her the freshest, and fairest, and
    daintiest little woman in the district.</p>
  <p>I was Jack&rsquo;s mate, so she always treated me as a sort of brother-in-law,
    and called me by my Christian name. Mates are closer than brothers in the
    bush.</p>
  <p>I turned my back and pretended to tighten the straps and girths on the packhorse
    while she said good-bye to Jack. I heard her speaking earnestly to him, and
    once I heard her mention Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&rsquo;s name. I thought Jack
    answered rather impatiently. &ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Clara,&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all over&mdash;past and gone. I wish you would
    believe it. You promised never to speak of that any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I know how it was. Jack never cared to hear about Peter; he was too ashamed
    of the past, perhaps; besides, deep down, we feel a sort of resentment towards
    any reference to a man who has helped or saved us in the past. It&rsquo;s
    human nature.</p>
  <p>Then they spoke in low tones for a while, and then Jack laughed, and kissed
    her, and said, &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be back before the time&rsquo;s up.&rdquo; Then
    he ran into the house to say good-bye to Mary&rsquo;s sister, who was staying
    with her, and who was laid up with a sprained ankle.</p>
  <p>Then Clara stepped up to me and laid her fingers on my shoulder. I trembled
    from head to foot and hoped she didn&rsquo;t notice it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; she said, looking at me with her big, searching grey
    eyes,  &ldquo;I believe I can trust you. I want you to look after Jack. You
    know why. Never let him have one drink if you can help it. One drink&mdash;the
    first drink will do it. I want you to promise me that you will never have
    a drink with Jack, no matter what happens or what he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I never will,&rdquo; I said, and I meant it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the first time he&rsquo;s been away from me since he gave
    up drinking, and if he comes back all right this time I will be sure of him
    and contented. But, Joe, if he comes back wrong it will kill me; it will
    break my heart. I want you to promise that if anything happens you will ride
    or wire for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan. I hear he&rsquo;s wool-sorting this year
    at Beenaway Station. Promise me that if anything happens you will ride for
    Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan and tell him, no matter what Jack says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>She half-held out her hand to me, but I kept both mine behind my back. I
    suppose she thought I didn&rsquo;t notice that she wanted to shake hands
    on the bargain; but the truth was that my hands shook so, and I didn&rsquo;t
    want her to notice&nbsp;<i>that</i>.</p>
  <p>I got on my horse and felt steadier. Then, &ldquo;Good-bye, Clara  &ldquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Good-bye,
    Jack.&rdquo; She bore up bravely, but I saw her eyes brimming. Jack got on
    his horse, and I bent over and shook hands with her. Jack bent down and kissed
    her while she stood on tiptoe. &ldquo;Good-bye, little woman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Cheer
    up, and I&rsquo;ll be back before you know where you are! You mustn&rsquo;t
    fret&mdash;you know why.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Jack!&rdquo;&mdash;she was breaking down.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack!&rdquo; I said, and we rode off, turning and waving
    our hats to her as she stood by the gate, looking a desolate little thing,
    I thought, till we turned down a bend of the road into the river.</p>
  <p>As we jogged along with the packhorse trotting behind us, and the quart-pots
    and hobble-chains jingling on the pack saddle, I pictured Clara running inside,
    to cry a while in her sister&rsquo;s arms, and then to bustle round and cheer
    up, for Jack&rsquo;s sake&mdash;and for the sake of something else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll christen him after you, Joe,&rdquo; said Jack, later on,
    when we&rsquo;d got confidential over our pipes after tea in our first camp.
    It never seemed to enter his head that there was the ghost of a chance that
    it might be a girl.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t come along when
    I was drinking,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>And as we lay rolled in our blankets under the stars I swore a big oath
    to myself.</p>
  <p>We got along comfortably and reached Beenaway Station in about a week, the
    day before the shearers&rsquo; roll-call. Jack never showed the slightest
    inclination to go into a shanty; and several times we talked about old times
    and what damned fools we&rsquo;d been throwing away our money over shanty
    bars shouting for loafers and cadgers. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this ever so much
    better, Joe?&rdquo; said Jack, as we lay on our blankets smoking one moonlight
    night. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in boozing, Joe, you can take it from
    me. Just you sling it for a year and then look back; you won&rsquo;t want
    to touch it again. You&rsquo;ve been straight for a couple of months. Sling
    it for good, Joe, before it gets a hold on you, like it did on me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>It was the morning after cut-out at Beenaway Shed, and we were glad. We
    were tired of the rush and roar and rattle and heat and grease and blasphemy
    of the big, hot, iron machine shed in that dusty patch in the barren scrubs.
    Swags were rolled up, saddle-bags packed, horses had been rounded up and
    driven in, the shearers&rsquo; cook and his mate had had their fight, and
    about a hundred men&mdash;shearers, rouseabouts, and wool-washers&mdash;were
    waiting round the little iron office to get their cheques.</p>
  <p>We were about half through when one bushman said to another: &ldquo;Stop
    your damned swearin&rsquo;, Jim. Here&rsquo;s Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan!&rdquo; Peter
    walked up and the men made way for him and he went into the office. There
    was always considerably less swearing for a few feet round about where Peter
    M&lsquo;Laughlan happened to be working in a shearing-shed. It seemed to
    be an understood thing with the men. He took no advantages, never volunteered
    to preach at a shed where he was working, and only spoke on union subjects
    when the men asked him to. He was  &ldquo;rep.&rdquo; (Shearers&rsquo; Union
    representative) at this shed, but squatters and station managers respected
    him as much as the men did.</p>
  <p>He seemed much greyer now, but still stood square and straight. And his
    eyes still looked one through.</p>
  <p>When Peter came out and the crowd had cleared away he took Jack aside and
    spoke to him in a low voice for a few minutes. I heard Jack say, &ldquo;Oh,
    that&rsquo;s all right, Peter! You have my word for it,&rdquo; and he got
    on his horse. I heard Peter say the one word, &ldquo;Remember!&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,
    that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Jack, and he shook hands with Peter,
    shouted, &ldquo;Come on, Joe!&rdquo; and started off with the packhorse after
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;wish I were going down with you, Joe.&rdquo;  said Peter to
    me, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t get away till to-morrow. I&rsquo;ve got that
    sick rouseabout on my hands, and I&rsquo;ll have to see him fixed up somehow
    and started off to the hospital&rdquo; (the nearest was a hundred miles away). &ldquo;And,
    by the way, I&rsquo;ve taken up a collection for him; I want a few shillings
    from you, Joe. I nearly forgot you. The poor fellow only got in about a fortnight&rsquo;s
    work, and there&rsquo;s a wife and youngsters in Sydney. I&rsquo;ll be down
    after you to-morrow. I promised to go to Comesomehow (there is a postal town
    in New South Wales called  &ldquo;Come-by-Chance&rdquo;) and get the people
    together and start an agitation for a half-time school there. Anyway, I&rsquo;ll
    be there by the end of the week. Good-bye, Joe. I must get some more money
    for the rouser from some of those chaps before they start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Comesomehow was a wretched cockatoo settlement, a bit off the track, about
    one hundred and fifty miles on our road home, where the settlers lived like
    savages and the children ran wild. I reckoned that Peter would have his work
    cut out to start a craving for education in that place.</p>
  <p>By saying he&rsquo;d be there I think he intended to give me a hint, in
    case anything happened. I believe now that Jack&rsquo;s wife had got anxious
    and had written to him.</p>
  <p>We jogged along comfortably and happily for three or four days, and as we
    passed shanty after shanty, and town after town, without Jack showing the
    slightest inclination to pull up at any of them, I began to feel safe about
    him.</p>
  <p>Then it happened, in the simplest way, as most things of this sort happen
    if you don&rsquo;t watch close.</p>
  <p>The third night it rained, rained heavens-hard, and rainy nights can be
    mighty cold out on those plains, even in mid-summer. Jack and I rigged up
    a strip of waterproof stuff we had to cover the swags on the packhorse, but
    the rain drove in, almost horizontally, and we got wet through, blankets,
    clothes and all. Jack got a bad cold and coughed fit to break himself; so
    about daylight, when the rain held up a bit, we packed up and rode on to
    the next pub, a wretched little weather board place in the scrub.</p>
  <p>Jack reckoned he&rsquo;d get some stuff for his cold there. I didn&rsquo;t
    like to speak, but before we reached the place I said, &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t
    touch a drink, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m a blanky fool?&rdquo; said Jack, and I shut
    up.</p>
  <p>The shanty was kept by a man who went by the name of Thomas, a notorious
    lamber-down (a shanty-keeper who entices cheque-men to drink), as I found
    out afterwards. He was a big, awkward bullock of a man, a selfish, ignorant
    brute, as anyone might have seen by his face; but he had a loud voice, and
    adopted a careless, rollicking, hail-fellow-well-met! come-in-and-sit-down-man-alive!
    clap-you-on-the-back style, which deceived a good many, or which a good many
    pretended to believe in. His &ldquo;missus&rdquo; was an animal of his own
    species, but she was duller and didn&rsquo;t bellow.</p>
  <p>He had a rather good-looking girl there&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know whether
    she was his daughter or not. They said that when he saw the shearers coming
    he&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;Run and titivate yourself, Mary; here comes the shearers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But what surprised me was that Jack Barnes didn&rsquo;t seem able to see
    through Thomas; he thought that he was all right, &ldquo;a bit of a rough
    diamond.&rdquo;  There are any amount of scoundrels and swindlers knocking
    about the world disguised as rough diamonds.</p>
  <p>Jack had a fit of coughing when we came in.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Jack!&rdquo; bellowed Thomas, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a regular
    churchyarder you&rsquo;ve got. Go in to the kitchen fire and I&rsquo;ll mix
    you a stiff toddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Thomas,&rdquo; said Jack, glancing at me rather sheepishly,
    I thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a hot cup of coffee presently, that&rsquo;ll
    do me more good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, man alive, one drink won&rsquo;t hurt you!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;I
    know you&rsquo;re on the straight, and you know I&rsquo;m the last man that &rsquo;ud
    try to get you off it. But you want something for that cold. You don&rsquo;t
    want to die on the track, do you? What would your missus say? That cough
    of yours is enough to bust a bullock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack isn&rsquo;t drinking, Thomas,&rdquo; I said rather shortly, &ldquo;and
    neither am I.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a cup of coffee at breakfast,&rdquo; said Jack; &ldquo;thank
    you all the same, Thomas.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right you are, Jack!&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; he roared
    at the girl,  &ldquo;chuck yerself about and get breakfast, and make a strong
    cup of coffee; and I say, missus&rdquo; (to his wife), &ldquo;git some honey
    and vinegar in a cup, will yer? or see if there&rsquo;s any of that cough
    stuff left in the bottle. Go into the kitchen, you chaps, and dry yourselves
    at the fire, you&rsquo;re wringing wet.&rdquo; Jack went through into the
    kitchen.</p>
  <p>I stepped out to see if the horses were all right, and as I came in again
    through the bar, Thomas, who had slipped behind the counter, crooked his
    finger at me and poured out a stiff whisky. &ldquo;I thought you might like
    to have it on the quiet,&rdquo; he whispered, with a wink.</p>
  <p>Now, there was this difference between Jack and me. When I was on the track,
    and healthy and contented, I could take a drink, or two drinks, and then
    leave it; or at other times I could drink all day, or all night, and be as
    happy as a lord, and be mighty sick and repentant all next day, and then
    not touch drink for a week; but if Jack once started, he was a lost man for
    days, for weeks, for months&mdash;as long as his cash or credit lasted. I
    felt a cold coming on me this morning, and wanted a whisky, so I had a drink
    with Thomas. Then, of course, I shouted in my turn, keeping an eye out in
    case Jack should come in. I went into the kitchen and steamed with Jack for
    a while in front of a big log fire, taking care to keep my breath away from
    him. Then we went in to breakfast. Those two drinks were all I meant to have,
    and we were going right on after breakfast.</p>
  <p>It was a good breakfast, ham and eggs, and we enjoyed it. The two whiskies
    had got to work. I hadn&rsquo;t touched drink for a long time. I shouldn&rsquo;t
    like to say that Thomas put anything in the drink he gave me. Before we started
    breakfast he put a glass down in front of me and said</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a good ginger-ale, it will warm you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I tasted it; it was rum, hot. I said nothing. What could I say?</p>
  <p>There was some joke about Jack being married and settled and steadied down,
    and me, his old mate, still on the wallaby; and Mrs Thomas said that I ought
    to follow Jack&rsquo;s example. And just then I felt a touch of that loneliness
    that some men feel when an old drinking mate turns teetotaller.</p>
  <p>Jack started coughing again, like an old cow with the pleuro.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That cough will kill you, Jack.&rdquo; said Thomas. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    put a drop of brandy in your coffee,&nbsp;<i>that</i>&nbsp;won&rsquo;t start
    you, anyhow; it&rsquo;s real &lsquo;Three Star.&rsquo; &ldquo; And he reached
    a bottle from the side-table.</p>
  <p>I should have stood up then, for my manhood, for my mate, and for little
    Clara, but I half rose from my chair, and Jack laughed and said, &ldquo;Sit
    down, Joe, you old fool, you&rsquo;re tanked. I know all about your seeing
    about the horses and your ginger ales. It&rsquo;s all right, old man. Do
    you think I&rsquo;m going on the booze? Why, I&rsquo;ll have to hold you
    on the horse all day.&rdquo; I sat down and took up my glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck, Joe!&rdquo; said Jack, laughing, and lifting up
    his cup of coffee with the brandy in it. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s luck, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then suddenly, and as clearly as I ever heard it, came Clara&rsquo;s voice
    to my ear: &ldquo;Promise me, whatever you do, that you will never have a
    drink with Jack.&rdquo; And I felt cold and sick to the stomach.</p>
  <p>I got up and went out. They thought that the drink had made me sick, but
    if I&rsquo;d stayed there another minute I would have tackled Thomas; and
    I knew that I needed a clear head to tackle a bullock like him. I walked
    about a bit, and when I came in again Jack and Thomas were in the bar, and
    Jack had a glass before him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Joe, you old bounder,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;come and
    have a whisky-and-soda; it will straighten you up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re drinking, Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;One drink won&rsquo;t
    hurt me. Do you think I&rsquo;m going on the booze? Have a soda and straighten
    up; we must make a start directly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I remember we had two or three whiskies, and then suddenly I tackled Thomas,
    and Jack was holding me back, and laughing and swearing at me at the same
    time, and I had a tussle with him; and then I was suddenly calmer and sensible,
    and we were shaking hands all round, and Jack was talking about just one
    more spree for the sake of old times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of a booze won&rsquo;t hurt me. Joe, you old fool,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have one more night of it, for the sake of Auld
    Lang Syne, and start at daylight in the morning. You go and see to the horses,
    it will straighten you up. Take the saddle off and hobble &rsquo;em out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But I insisted on starting at once, and Jack promised he would. We were
    gloriously happy for an hour or so, and then I went to sleep.</p>
  <p>When I woke it was late in the afternoon. I was very giddy and shaky; the
    girl brought me a whisky-and-soda, and that steadied me. Some more shearers
    had arrived, and Jack was playing cards with two of them on top of a cask
    in the bar. Thomas was dead drunk on the floor, or pretending to be so, and
    his wife was behind the bar. I went out to see to the horses; I found them
    in a bush yard at the back. The packhorse was rolling in the mud with the
    pack-saddle and saddlebags on. One of the chaps helped me take off the saddles
    and put them in the harness-room behind the kitchen.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ll pass over that night. It wouldn&rsquo;t be very edifying to the
    great, steady-living, sober majority, and the others, the ne&rsquo;er-do-wells,
    the rovers, wrecks and failures, will understand only too well without being
    told&mdash;only too well, God help them!</p>
  <p>When I woke in the morning I couldn&rsquo;t have touched a drink to save
    my life. I was fearfully shaky, and swimming about the head, but I put my
    head over a tub under the pump and got the girl to pump for a while, and
    then I drank a pint of tea and managed to keep it down, and felt better.</p>
  <p>All through the last half of the night I&rsquo;d kept saying, in a sort
    of drink nightmare, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan in the
    morning. I&rsquo;ll go for Peter as soon as I can stand! &ldquo; and repeating
    Clara Barnes&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Ride for Peter if anything happens. Ride
    for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were drunken shearers, horsemen and swagmen sleeping all over the
    place, and in all sorts of odd positions; some on the veranda with their
    heads on their swags, one sitting back against the wall, and one on the broad
    of his back with his head on the bare boards and his mouth open. There was
    another horse rolling in its saddle, and I took the saddle off. The horse
    belonged to an English University man.</p>
  <p>I went in to see how Jack was. He was lying in the parlour on a little,
    worn-out, horse-hair sofa, that might have seen better days in some clean
    home in the woman-and-girl world. He had been drinking and playing cards
    till early that morning, and he looked awful&mdash;he looked as if he&rsquo;d
    been boozing for a month.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See what you&rsquo;ve done!&rdquo; he said, sitting up and glaring
    at me; then he said, &ldquo;Bring me a whisky-and-soda, Joe, for God&rsquo;s
    sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got a whisky-and-soda from the girl and took it to him.</p>
  <p>I talked to him for a while, and at last he said, &ldquo;Well, go and get
    the horses and we&rsquo;ll start.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got the horses ready and brought them round to the front, but by that
    time he&rsquo;d had more drink, and he said he wanted to sleep before he
    started. Next he was playing cards with one of the chaps, and asked me to
    wait till he&rsquo;d finished that game. I knew he&rsquo;d keep promising
    and humbugging me till there was a row, so at last I got him aside and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack, I&rsquo;m going for Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to hell!&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>I put the other horses back in the yard, the saddles in the skillion, got
    on my horse and rode off. Thomas and the others asked me no questions, they
    took no notice. In a place like that a man could almost do anything, short
    of hanging himself, without anyone interfering or being surprised. And probably,
    if he did hang himself, they&rsquo;d let him swing for a while to get a taste
    of it.</p>
  <p>Comesomehow was about fifteen miles back on a track off the main road. I
    reckoned that I could find Peter and bring him on by the afternoon, and I
    rode hard, sick as I was. I was too sick to smoke.</p>
  <p>As it happened, Peter had started early from his last camp and I caught
    him just as he was turning off into Comesomehow track.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Joe?&rdquo; he asked as I rode up to him&mdash;but
    he could see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack Barnes is on the booze at Thomas&rsquo;s,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>Peter just looked right through me. Then he turned his horse&rsquo;s head
    without a word, and rode back with me. And, after a while, he said, as if
    to himself:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Clara! Poor little lassie!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By the time we reached the shanty it was well on in the afternoon. A fight
    was stopped in the first round and voices lowered when the chaps caught sight
    of us. As Peter walked into the bar one or two drunks straightened themselves
    and took off their hats with drunken sentiment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is Jack Barnes, Thomas?&rdquo; asked Peter, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in there if you want to see him,&rdquo; said Thomas, jerking
    his head towards the parlour.</p>
  <p>We went in, and when Peter saw Jack lying there I noticed that swift, haunted
    look came into his eyes, as if he&rsquo;d seen a ghost of the past.</p>
  <p>He sat down by the sofa to wait until Jack woke. I thought as he sat there
    that his eyes were like a woman&rsquo;s for sympathy and like a dog&rsquo;s
    for faithfulness. I was very shaky.</p>
  <p>Presently Thomas looked in. &ldquo;Is there anything I can do for you, M&lsquo;Laughlan?&rdquo; he
    asked in as civil a tone as he could get to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;bring me a flask of your best whisky&mdash;your
    own, mind&mdash;and a glass.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We shall need the whisky for him on the track, Joe,&rdquo; said Peter,
    when the flask came. &ldquo;Get another glass and a bottle of soda; you want
    a nip.&rdquo;  He poured out a drink for himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The first thing we&rsquo;ve got to do is to get him away; then I&rsquo;ll
    soon put him on his feet. But we&rsquo;ll let him sleep a while longer. I
    find I&rsquo;ve got business near Solong, and I&rsquo;m going down with you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>By and by Jack woke up and glared round, and when he caught sight of Peter
    he just reached for his hands and said, &ldquo;Peter! Thank God you&rsquo;ve
    come!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;But I must have a drink first, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Jack, you shall have a drink,&rdquo; said Peter; and he
    gave him a stiff nobbler. It steadied Jack a bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now listen to me, Jack,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;How much money
    have you got left?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    got a cheque for twenty pounds here, sewn inside my shirt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but you drew thirty-six in three cheques. Where&rsquo;s the
    rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thomas has ten,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;and the six-well, the six
    is gone. I was playing cards last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter stepped out into the bar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Thomas,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got
    a ten-pound cheque from Barnes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, how much of it does he owe you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The whole, and more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean to tell me that? He has only been here since yesterday
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes; but he&rsquo;s been shoutin&rsquo; all round. Look at all these
    chaps here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They only came yesterday afternoon,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;Here,
    you had best take this and give me the cheque;&rdquo; and Peter laid a five-pound
    note on the bar. Thomas bucked at first, but in the end he handed over the
    cheque&mdash;he had had several warnings from the police. Then he suddenly
    lost all control over himself; he came round from behind the bar and faced
    Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, you mongrel parson!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; do
    you mean by coming into my bar and interfering with me. Who the &mdash;&mdash; are
    you anyway? A &mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; He used the worst oaths that were used
    in the bush. &ldquo;Take off &mdash;&mdash; your coat!&rdquo; he roared at
    last, shaping up to Peter.</p>
  <p>Peter stepped back a pace and buttoned his coat and threw back his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No need to take off my coat, Thomas,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
    ready.&rdquo; He said it very quietly, but there was a danger-signal&mdash;a
    red light in his eyes. He was quiet-voiced but hard-knuckled, as some had
    reason to know.</p>
  <p>Thomas balked like a bull at a spread umbrella. Jack lurched past me as
    I stood in the parlour door, but I caught him and held him back; and almost
    at the same moment a wretched old boozer that we called &ldquo;Awful Example,&rdquo;  who
    had been sitting huddled, a dirty bundle of rags and beard and hair, in the
    corner of the bar, struggled to his feet, staggered forward and faced Thomas,
    looking once again like something that might have been a man. He snatched
    a thick glass bottle from the counter and held it by the neck in his right
    hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stand back, Thomas!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Lay a hand&mdash;lay
    a finger on Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, and I&rsquo;ll smash your head, as sure
    as there&rsquo;s a God above us and I&rsquo;m a ruined man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter took &ldquo;Awful&rdquo; gently by the shoulders and sat him down. &ldquo;You
    keep quiet, old man,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;nothing is going to happen.&rdquo; Thomas
    went round behind the bar muttering something about it not being worth his
    while to, etc.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You go and get the horses ready, Joe,&rdquo; said Peter to me; &ldquo;and
    you sit down, Jack, and keep quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He can get the horses,&rdquo; growled Thomas, from behind the bar, &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;m damned if he gets the saddles. I&rsquo;ve got them locked up, and
    I&rsquo;ll something well keep them till Barnes is sober enough to pay me
    what he owes me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then a tall, good-looking chap, with dark-blue eyes and a long, light-coloured
    moustache, stepped into the bar from the crowd on the veranda.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this, Thomas?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that got to do with you, Gentleman Once?&rdquo; shouted
    Thomas.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s got something to do with me,&rdquo; said Gentleman
    Once.  &ldquo;Now, look here, Thomas; you can do pretty well what you like
    with us poor devils, and you know it, but we draw the line at Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan.
    If you really itch for the thrashing you deserve you must tempt someone else
    to give it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What the &mdash;&mdash; are you talking about?&rdquo; snorted Thomas. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    drunk or ratty!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble, M&lsquo;Laughlan?&rdquo; asked Gentleman
    Once, turning to Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No trouble at all, Gentleman Once,&rdquo; said Peter; &ldquo;thank
    you all the same. I&rsquo;ve managed worse men than our friend Thomas. Now,
    Thomas, don&rsquo;t you think it would pay you best to hand over the key
    of the harness-room and have done with this nonsense? I&rsquo;m a patient
    man&mdash;a very patient man&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve not always been so, and
    the old blood comes up sometimes, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thomas couldn&rsquo;t stand this sort of language, because he couldn&rsquo;t
    understand it. He threw the key on the bar and told us to clear out.</p>
  <p>We were all three very quiet riding along the track that evening. Peter
    gave Jack a nip now and again from the flask, and before we turned in in
    camp he gave him what he called a soothing draught from a little medicine
    chest that he carried in his saddle-bag. Jack seemed to have got rid of his
    cough; he slept all night, and in the morning, after he&rsquo;d drunk a pint
    of mutton-broth that Peter had made in one of the billies, he was all right&mdash;except
    that he was quiet and ashamed. I had never known him to be so quiet, and
    for such a length of time, since we were boys together. He had learned his
    own weakness; he&rsquo;d lost all his cocksureness. I know now just exactly
    how he felt. He felt as if his sober year had been lost and he would have
    to live it all over again.</p>
  <p>Peter didn&rsquo;t preach. He just jogged along and camped with us as if
    he were an ordinary, every-day mate. He yarned about all sorts of things.
    He could tell good yarns, and when he was fairly on you could listen to him
    all night. He seemed to have been nearly all over the world. Peter never
    preached except when he was asked to hold service in some bush pub, station-homestead
    or bush church. But in a case like ours he had a way of telling a little
    life story, with something in it that hit the young man he wanted to reform,
    and hit him hard. He&rsquo;d generally begin quietly, when we were comfortable
    with our pipes in camp after tea, with &ldquo;I once knew a young man&mdash;&rdquo; or &ldquo;That
    reminds me of a young fellow I knew&mdash;&rdquo; and so on. You never knew
    when he was going to begin, or when he was going to hit you. In our last
    camp, before we reached Solong, he told two of his time-fuse yarns. I haven&rsquo;t
    time to tell them now, but one stuffed up my pipe for a while, and made Jack&rsquo;s
    hand tremble when he tried to light his. I&rsquo;m glad it was too dark to
    see our faces. We lay a good while afterwards, rolled in our blankets, and
    couldn&rsquo;t get to sleep for thinking; but Peter seemed to fall asleep
    as soon as he turned in.</p>
  <p>Next day he told Jack not to tell Clara that he&rsquo;d come down with us.
    He said he wouldn&rsquo;t go right into Solong with us; he was going back
    along another road to stay a day or two with an old friend of his.</p>
  <p>When we reached Solong we stopped on the river-bank just out of sight of
    Jack&rsquo;s house. Peter took the ten-pound cheque from his pocket and gave
    it to Jack. Jack hadn&rsquo;t seen Peter give the shanty-keeper the five-pound
    note.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I owed Thomas something,&rdquo; said Jack, staring. &ldquo;However
    did you manage to get the cheque out of him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Jack, I managed,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>Jack sat silent for a while, then he began to breathe hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to say, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say nothing, Jack. Only promise me that you will give Clara the cheques
    as soon as you go home, and let her take care of the cash for a while.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>Jack looked down at the ground for a while, then he lifted his head and
    looked Peter in the eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Peter,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t speak. I&rsquo;m ashamed
    to make a promise; I&rsquo;ve broken so many. I&rsquo;ll try to thank you
    in a year&rsquo;s time from now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ask for no promises,&rdquo; said Peter, and he held out his hand.
    Jack gripped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you coming home with me, Joe?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into town. See you in the
    morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack rode on. When he got along a piece Peter left his horse and moved up
    to the head of the lane to watch Jack, and I followed. As Jack neared the
    cottage we saw a little figure in a cloak run out to the front gate. She
    had heard the horses and the jingle of the camp-ware on the pack-saddle.
    We saw Jack jump down and take her in his arms. I looked at Peter, and as
    he watched them, something, that might have been a strange look of the old
    days, came into his eyes.</p>
  <p>He shook hands with me. &ldquo;Good-bye, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He rode across the river again. He took the track that ran along the foot
    of the spurs by the river, and up over a gap in the curve of blue hills,
    and down and out west towards the Big Scrubs. And as he rounded the last
    spur, with his packhorse trotting after him, I thought he must have felt
    very lonely. And I felt lonely too.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStoryofGentlemanOnce"></a>The Story of  &ldquo;Gentleman
      Once&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="note">They learn the world from black-sheep,<br>
    Who know it all too well.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Out
  Back.</i></p>
  <p>Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan, bush missionary, Joe Wilson and his mate, Jack Barnes,
    shearers for the present, and a casual swagman named Jack Mitchell, were
    camped at Cox&rsquo;s Crossing in a bend of Eurunderee Creek.</p>
  <p>It was a grassy little flat with gum-trees standing clear and clean like
    a park. At the back was the steep grassy siding of a ridge, and far away
    across the creek to the south a spur from the Blue Mountain range ran west,
    with a tall, blue granite peak showing clear in the broad moonlight, yet
    dream-like and distant over the sweeps of dark green bush.</p>
  <p>There was the jingle of hobble-chains and a crunching at the grass where
    the horses moved in the soft shadows amongst the trees. Up the creek on the
    other side was a surveyors&rsquo; camp, and from there now and again came
    the sound of a good voice singing verses of old songs; and later on the sound
    of a violin and a cornet being played, sometimes together and sometimes each
    on its own.</p>
  <p>Wilson and Barnes were on their way home from shearing out back in the great
    scrubs at Beenaway Shed. They had been rescued by Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan
    from a wayside shanty where they had fallen, in spite of mutual oaths and
    past promises, sacred and profane, because they had got wringing wet in a
    storm on the track and caught colds, and had been tempted to take just one
    drink.</p>
  <p>They were in a bad way, and were knocking down their cheques beautifully
    when Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan came along. He rescued them and some of their
    cash from the soulless shantykeeper, and was riding home with them, on some
    pretence, because he had known them as boys, because Joe Wilson had a vein
    of poetry in him&mdash;a something in sympathy with something in Peter; because
    Jack Barnes had a dear little girl-wife who was much too good for him, and
    who was now anxiously waiting for him in the pretty little farming town of
    Solong amongst the western spurs. Because, perhaps, of something in Peter&rsquo;s
    early past which was a mystery. Simply and plainly because Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan
    was the kindest, straightest and truest man in the West&mdash;a &ldquo;white
    man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They all knew Mitchell and welcomed him heartily when he turned up in their
    camp, because he was a pathetic humorist and a kindly cynic&mdash;a &ldquo;joker&rdquo;  or &ldquo;hard
    case&rdquo; as the bushmen say.</p>
  <p>Peter was about fifty and the other three were young men.</p>
  <p>There was another man in camp who didn&rsquo;t count and was supposed to
    be dead. Old Danny Quinn, champion &ldquo;beer chewer&rdquo; of the district,
    was on his way out, after a spree, to one of Rouse&rsquo;s stations, where,
    for the sake of past services&mdash;long past&mdash;and because of old times,
    he was supposed to be working. He had spent his last penny a week before
    and had clung to his last-hope hotel until the landlord had taken him in
    one hand and his swag in the other and lifted them clear of the veranda.
    Danny had blundered on, this far, somehow; he was the last in the world who
    could have told how, and had managed to light a fire; then he lay with his
    head on his swag and enjoyed nips of whisky in judicious doses and at reasonable
    intervals, and later on a tot of mutton-broth, which he made in one of the
    billies.</p>
  <p>It was after tea. Peter sat on a log by the fire with Joe and Jack Mitchell
    on one side and Jack Barnes on the other. Jack Mitchell sat on the grass
    with his back to the log, his knees drawn up, and his arms abroad on them:
    his most comfortable position and one which seemed to favour the flow of
    his philosophy. They talked of bush things or reflected, sometimes all three
    together, sometimes by turns.</p>
  <p>From the surveyors&rsquo; camp,&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The house where I was born,<br>
    The little window where the sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came peeping in at morn&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The breeze from the west strengthened and the voice was blown away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That chap seems a bit sentimental but he&rsquo;s got a good voice,&rdquo;  said
    Mitchell. Then presently he remarked, round his pipe,&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder if old Danny remembers?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And presently Peter said quietly, as if the thought had just occurred to
    him</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way, Mitchell, I forgot to ask after your old folk. I knew
    your father, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re all right, Peter, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Heard from them lately?&rdquo; asked Peter, presently, in a lazy
    tone.</p>
  <p>Mitchell straightened himself up. &ldquo;N&mdash;no. To tell the truth,
    Peter, I haven&rsquo;t written for&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know how long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter smoked reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember your father well, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He was
    a big-hearted man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Danny was heard remonstrating loudly with spirits from a warmer clime
    than Australia, and Peter stepped over to soothe him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d get it, directly after I opened my mouth,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell. &ldquo;I suppose it will be your turn next, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Joe, resignedly. The wind fell.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it gives me little joy,<br>
    To think I&rsquo;m further off from heaven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than when I was a boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Peter came back another thought seemed to have occurred to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your mother getting on, Joe?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;She
    shifted to Sydney after your father died, didn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s getting on all right!&rdquo; said Joe, without elaboration.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Keeping a boarding-house, isn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hard to make ends meet, I suppose?&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    almost a harder life than it could have been on the old selection, and there&rsquo;s
    none of the old independence about it. A woman like your mother must feel
    it, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s used
    to it by this time. I manage to send her a few pounds now and again. I send
    her all I can,&rdquo; he added resentfully.</p>
  <p>Peter sat corrected for a few moments. Then he seemed to change the subject.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some time since you were in Sydney last, isn&rsquo;t it,
    Joe?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter,&rdquo; said Joe. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been there for
    two years. I never did any good there. I&rsquo;m far better knocking about
    out back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some men seem to get on better in one place, some in another,&rdquo;  reflected
    Mitchell, lazily. &ldquo;For my part, I seem to get on better in another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter blinked, relit his pipe with a stick from the fire and reflected.</p>
  <p>The surveyor&rsquo;s song had been encored:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I remember, I remember&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Perhaps Peter remembered. Joe did, but there were no vines round the house
    where he was born, only drought and dust, and raspy voices raised in recrimination,
    and hardship most times.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Peter, quietly, &ldquo;I remember a young
    fellow at home in the old country. He had every advantage. He had a first-class
    education, a great deal more money than he needed&mdash;almost as much as
    he asked for, and nearly as much freedom as he wanted. His father was an
    English gentleman and his mother an English lady. They were titled people,
    if I remember rightly. The old man was proud, but fond of his son; he only
    asked him to pay a little duty or respect now and again. We don&rsquo;t understand
    these things in Australia&mdash;they seem formal and cold to us. The son
    paid his respects to his father occasionally&mdash;a week or so before he&rsquo;d
    be wanting money, as a rule. The mother was a dear lady. She idolized her
    son. She only asked for a little show of affection from him, a few days or
    a week of his society at home now and then&mdash;say once in three months.
    But he couldn&rsquo;t spare her even that&mdash;his time was taken up so
    much in fashionable London and Paris and other places. He would give the
    world to be able to take his proud, soft old father&rsquo;s hand now and
    look into his eyes as one man who understands another. He would be glad and
    eager to give his mother twelve months out of the year if he thought it would
    make her happier. It has been too late for more than twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Danny called for Peter.</p>
  <p>Mitchell jerked his head approvingly and gave a sound like a sigh and chuckle
    conjoined, the one qualifying the other. &ldquo;I told you you&rsquo;d get
    it, Joe,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it hits me,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But it hit all the same, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose it did,&rdquo; said Joe, after a short pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have hit you so hard if you hadn&rsquo;t tried
    to parry,&rdquo;  reflected Mitchell. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s your turn now, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes said nothing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now I know that Peter would do anything for a woman or child, or
    an honest, straight, hard-up chap,&rdquo; said Mitchell, straightening out
    his legs and folding his arms, &ldquo;but I can&rsquo;t quite understand
    his being so partial to drunken scamps and vagabonds, black sheep and ne&rsquo;er-do-wells.
    He&rsquo;s got a tremendous sympathy for drunks. He&rsquo;d do anything to
    help a drunken man. Ain&rsquo;t it marvellous? It&rsquo;s my private opinion
    that Peter must have been an awful boozer and scamp in his time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The other two only thought. Mitchell was privileged. He was a young man
    of freckled, sandy complexion, and quizzical grey eyes. &ldquo;Sly Joker&rdquo;  &ldquo;could
    take a rise out of anyone on the quiet;&rdquo; &ldquo;You could never tell
    when he was getting at you;&rdquo; &ldquo;Face of a born comedian,&rdquo; as
    bushmen said of Mitchell. But he would probably have been a dead and dismal
    failure on any other stage than that of wide Australia.</p>
  <p>Peter came back and they sat and smoked, and maybe they reflected along
    four very different back-tracks for a while.</p>
  <p>The surveyor started to sing again:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;I have heard the mavis singing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love-song to the morn.<br>
    I have seen the dew-drop clinging<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the rose just newly born.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They smoked and listened in silence all through to the end. It was very
    still. The full moon was high. The long white slender branches of a box-tree
    stirred gently overhead; the she-oaks in the creek sighed as they are always
    sighing, and the southern peak seemed ever so far away.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;That has made me thine for ever!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bonny Mary of Argyle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blarst my pipe!&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell, suddenly. &ldquo;I beg
    your pardon, Peter. My pipe&rsquo;s always getting stuffed up,&rdquo; and
    he proceeded to shell out and clear his pipe.</p>
  <p>The breeze had changed and strengthened. They heard the violin playing &ldquo;Annie
    Laurie.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They must be having a Scotch night in that camp tonight,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell. The voice came again:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Maxwelton Braes are bonny&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where early fa&rsquo;s the dew,<br>
    For &rsquo;twas there that Annie Laurie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gie me her promise true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell threw out his arm impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish they wouldn&rsquo;t play and sing those old songs,&rdquo; he
    said.  &ldquo;They make you think of damned old things. I beg your pardon,
    Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter sat leaning forward, his elbows resting on his knees and his hands
    fingering his cold pipe nervously. His sad eyes had grown haggard and haunted.
    It is in the hearts of exiles in new lands that the old songs are felt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take no thought of the morrow, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Peter, abstractedly. &ldquo;I
    beg your pardon, Mitchell. I mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
    right; to-morrow is the past, as far as I&rsquo;m concerned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter blinked down at him as if he were a new species.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an odd young man, Mitchell,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
    have to take care of that head of yours or you&rsquo;ll be found hanging
    by a saddle-strap to a leaning tree on a lonely track, or find yourself in
    a lunatic asylum before you&rsquo;re forty-five.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or else I&rsquo;ll be a great man,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But&mdash;ah,
    well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter turned his eyes to the fire and smiled sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not enjoyment and not sorrow, is our destined end or way,&rdquo; he
    repeated to the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But we get there just the same,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;destined
    or not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;But to live, that each to-morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finds us further than to-day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, that just fits my life, Peter,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    might have to tramp two or three hundred miles before I get a cut (a pen,
    or &ldquo;stand&rdquo; in a shearing shed) or a job, and if to-morrow didn&rsquo;t
    find me nearer than to-day I&rsquo;d starve or die of thirst on a dry stretch.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you get married and settle down, Mitchell?&rdquo; asked
    Peter, a little tired. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a teetotaller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I got married I couldn&rsquo;t settle down,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    reckon I&rsquo;d be the loneliest man in Australia.&rdquo; Peter gave him
    a swift glance.  &ldquo;I reckon I&rsquo;d be single no matter how much married
    I might be. I couldn&rsquo;t get the girl I wanted, and&mdash;ah, well!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell&rsquo;s expression was still quaintly humorous round the lower
    part of his face, but there was a sad light in his eyes. The strange light
    as of the old dead days, and he was still young.</p>
  <p>The cornet had started in the surveyors&rsquo; camp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Their blooming tunes seem to fit in just as if they knew what we
    were talking about,&rdquo; remarked Mitchell.</p>
  <p>The cornet:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break my heart, you little bird,<br>
    That sings upon the flowering thorn&mdash;<br>
    Thou mind &rsquo;st me of departed joys,<br>
    Departed never to return.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damn it all,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sitting up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting
    sentimental.&rdquo; Then, as if voicing something that was troubling him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    you think a woman pulls a man down as often as she lifts him up, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some say so,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some say so, and they write it, too,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Sometimes
    it seems to me as if women were fated to drag a man down ever since Adam&rsquo;s
    time. If Adam hadn&rsquo;t taken his wife&rsquo;s advice&mdash;but there,
    perhaps he took her advice a good many times and found it good, and, just
    because she happened to be wrong this time, and to get him into a hole, the
    sons of Adam have never let the daughters of Eve hear the last of it. That&rsquo;s
    human nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes, the young husband, who was suffering a recovery, had been very
    silent all the evening. &ldquo;I think a man&rsquo;s a fool to always listen
    to his wife&rsquo;s advice,&rdquo; he said, with the unreasonable impatience
    of a man who wants to think while others are talking. &ldquo;She only messes
    him up, and drives him to the devil as likely as not, and gets a contempt
    for him in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter gave him a surprised, reproachful look, and stood up. He paced backwards
    and forwards on the other side of the fire, with his hands behind his back
    for a while; then he came and settled himself on the log again and filled
    his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a man can always find excuses for himself
    when his conscience stings him. He puts mud on the sting. Man at large is
    beginning all over the world to rake up excuses for himself; he disguises
    them as  &lsquo;Psychological studies,&rsquo; and thinks he is clean and
    clever and cultured, or he calls &rsquo;em problems&mdash;the sex problem,
    for instance, and thinks he is brave and fearless. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Danny was in trouble again, and Peter went to him. He complained that when
    he lay down he saw the faces worse, and he wanted to be propped up somehow,
    so Peter got a pack-saddle and propped the old man&rsquo;s shoulders up with
    that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; Peter began, when be came back to the fire, &ldquo;I
    remember a young man who got married&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell hugged himself. He knew Jack Barnes. He knew that Jack had a girl-wife
    who was many times too good for him; that Jack had been wild, and had nearly
    broken her heart, and he had guessed at once that Jack had broken out again,
    and that Peter M&lsquo;Laughlan was shepherding him home. Mitchell had worked
    as mates with Jack, and liked him because of the good heart that was in him
    in spite of all; and, because he liked him, he was glad that Jack was going
    to get a kicking, so to speak, which might do him good. Mitchell saw it coming,
    as he said afterwards, and filled his pipe, and settled himself comfortably
    to listen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I remember the case of a naturally selfish young man who got married&rdquo; said
    Peter. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know he was selfish; in fact, he thought he
    was too much the other way&mdash;but that doesn&rsquo;t matter now. His name
    was&mdash;well, we&rsquo;ll call him&mdash;we&rsquo;ll call him, &lsquo;Gentleman
    Once.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you mean Gentleman Once that we saw drinking back at Thomas&rsquo;s
    shanty?&rdquo; asked Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;not him. There have been more than
    one in the bush who went by the nickname of &lsquo;Gentleman Once.&rsquo; I
    knew one or two. It&rsquo;s a big clan, the clan of Gentleman Once, and scattered
    all over the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;excuse me for interrupting,
    Peter&mdash;but wasn&rsquo;t old Danny, there, a gentleman once? I&rsquo;ve
    heard chaps say he was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know he was,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once! Who&rsquo;s talking about Gentleman Once?&rdquo; said
    an awful voice, suddenly and quickly. &ldquo;About twenty or thirty years
    ago I was called Gentleman Once or Gentleman Jack, I don&rsquo;t know which&mdash;Get
    out!&nbsp;<i>Get out</i>, I say! It&rsquo;s all lies, and you&rsquo;re the
    devil. There&rsquo;s four devils sitting by the fire. I see them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Two of the four devils by the fire looked round, rather startled.</p>
  <p>Danny was sitting up, his awful bloodshot eyes glaring in the firelight,
    and his ruined head looking like the bloated head of a hairy poodle that
    had been drowned and dried. Peter went to the old man and soothed him by
    waving off the snakes and devils with his hands, and telling them to go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard Danny on the Gentleman Once racket before,&rdquo; remarked
    Mitchell. &ldquo;Seems funny, doesn&rsquo;t it, for a man to be proud of
    the fact that he was called &lsquo;Gentleman Once&rsquo; about twenty years
    ago?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Seems more awful than funny to me,&rdquo; said Joe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Joe,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But the saddest
    things are often funny.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Peter came back he went on with his story, and was only interrupted
    once or twice by Danny waking up and calling him to drive off the snakes,
    and green and crimson dogs with crocodile heads, and devils with flaming
    tails, and those unpleasant sorts of things that force their company on boozers
    and madmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;he came from the old country
    with a good education and no character. He disgraced himself and family once
    too often and came, or was sent, out to Australia to reform. It&rsquo;s a
    great mistake. If a man is too far gone, or hasn&rsquo;t the strength to
    live the past down and reform at home, he won&rsquo;t do it in a new country,
    unless a combination of circumstances compels him to it. A man rises by chance;
    just as often he falls by chance. Some men fall into the habit of keeping
    steady and stick to it, for the novelty of it, until they are on their feet
    and in their sane minds and can look at the past, present and future sensibly.
    I knew one case&mdash; But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the story.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once came out on the remittance system. That system is
    fatal in nine cases out of ten. The remittance system is an insult to any
    manhood that may be left in the black sheep, and an insult to the land he
    is sent to. The cursed quarterly allowance is a stone round his neck which
    will drag him down deeper in a new land than he would have fallen at home.
    You know that remittance men are regarded with such contempt in the bush
    that a man seldom admits he is one, save when he&rsquo;s drunk and reckless
    and wants money or credit. When a ne&rsquo;er-do-well lands in Melbourne
    or Sydney without a penny he will probably buck-up and do something for himself.
    When he lands with money he will probably spend it all in the first few months
    and then straighten up, because he has to. But when he lands on the remittance
    system he drinks, first to drown homesickness. He decides that he&rsquo;ll
    wait till he gets his next quarter&rsquo;s allowance and then look round.
    He persuades himself that it&rsquo;s no use trying to do anything: that,
    in fact, he can&rsquo;t do anything until he gets his money. When he gets
    it he drifts into one &lsquo;last&rsquo; night with chums he has picked up
    in second and third-rate hotels. He drinks from pure selfishness. No matter
    what precautions his friends at home take, he finds means of getting credit
    or drawing on his allowance before it is due&mdash;until he is two or three
    quarters behind. He drinks because he feels happy and jolly and clever and
    good-natured and brave and honest while he is drinking. Later on he drinks
    because he feels the reverse of all these things when he is sober. He drinks
    to drown the past and repentance. He doesn&rsquo;t know that a healthy-minded
    man doesn&rsquo;t waste time in repenting. He doesn&rsquo;t know how easy
    it is to reform, and is too weakwilled to try. He gets a muddled idea that
    the past can&rsquo;t be mended. He finds it easy to get drink and borrow
    money on the strength of his next quarter&rsquo;s allowance, so he soon gets
    a quarter or two behind, and sometimes gets into trouble connected with borrowed
    money. He drifts to the bush and drinks, to drown the past only. The past
    grows blacker and blacker until it is a hell without repentance; and often
    the black sheep gets to that state when a man dreads his sober hours. And
    the end? Well, you see old Danny there, and you saw old Awful Example back
    at Thomas&rsquo;s shanty&mdash;he&rsquo;s worse than Danny, if anything.
    Sometimes the end comes sooner. I saw a young new-land-new-leaf man dying
    in a cheap lodging-house in Sydney. He was a schoolmate of mine, by the way.
    For six weeks he lay on his back and suffered as I never saw a man suffer
    in this world; and I&rsquo;ve seen some bad cases. They had to chloroform
    him every time they wanted to move him. He had affected to be hard and cynical,
    and I must say that he played it out to the end. It was a strong character,
    a strong mind sodden and diseased with drink. He never spoke of home and
    his people except when he was delirious. He never spoke, even to me, of his
    mental agony. That was English home training. You young Australians wouldn&rsquo;t
    understand it; most bushmen are poets and emotional.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My old schoolmate was shifted to the Sydney Hospital at last, and
    consented to the amputation of one leg. But it was too late. He was gone
    from the hips down. Drink&mdash;third-rate hotel and bush shanty drink&mdash;and
    low debauchery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes drew up his leg and rubbed it surreptitiously. He had  &ldquo;pins
    and needles.&rdquo; Mitchell noticed and turned a chuckle into a grunt.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once was a remittance man,&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;But
    before he got very far he met an Australian girl in a boarding-house. Her
    mother was the landlady. They were bush people who had drifted to the city.
    The girl was pretty, intelligent and impulsive. She pitied him and nursed
    him. He wasn&rsquo;t known as Gentleman Once then, he hadn&rsquo;t got far
    enough to merit the nickname.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter paused. Presently he jerked his head, as if he felt a spasm of pain,
    and leaned forward to get a stick from the fire to light his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the girl who marries a man to reform him, and
    when she has reformed him never lets him hear the last of it. Sometimes,
    as a woman, she drives him back again. But this was not one of that sort
    of girls. I once held a theory that sometimes a girl who has married a man
    and reformed him misses in the reformed man the something which attracted
    her in the careless scamp, the something which made her love him&mdash;and
    so she ceases to love him, and their married life is a far more miserable
    one than it would have been had he continued drinking. I hold no theory of
    that kind now. Such theories ruin many married lives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter jerked his head again as if impatient with a thought, and reached
    for a fire-stick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with the story. When Gentleman
    Once reformed his natural selfishness came back. He saw that he had made
    a mistake. It&rsquo;s a terrible thing for a young man, a few months, perhaps
    a few weeks after his marriage, to ask himself the question, &lsquo;Have
    I made a mistake?&rsquo; But Gentleman Once wasn&rsquo;t to be pitied. He
    discovered that he had married beneath him in intellect and education. Home
    training again. He couldn&rsquo;t have discovered that he had married beneath
    him as far as birth was concerned, for his wife&rsquo;s father had been a
    younger son of an older and greater family than his own&mdash; But Gentleman
    Once wouldn&rsquo;t have been cad enough to bother about birth. I&rsquo;ll
    do him that much justice. He discovered, or thought he did, that he and his
    wife could never have one thought in common; that she couldn&rsquo;t possibly
    understand him. I&rsquo;ll tell you later on whether he was mistaken or not.
    He was gloomy most times, and she was a bright, sociable, busy little body.
    When she tried to draw him out of himself he grew irritable. Besides, having
    found that they couldn&rsquo;t have a thought in common he ceased to bother
    to talk to her. There are many men who don&rsquo;t bother talking to their
    wives; they don&rsquo;t think their wives feel it&mdash;because the wives
    cease to complain after a while; they grow tired of trying to make the man
    realize how they suffer. Gentleman Once tried his best&mdash;according to
    his lights&mdash;and weakness. Then he went in for self-pity and all the
    problems. He liked to brood, and his poor little wife&rsquo;s energy and
    cheerfulness were wearying to him. He wanted to be left alone. They were
    both high-spirited, in different ways; she was highly strung and so was he&mdash;because
    of his past life mostly. They quarrelled badly sometimes. Then he drank again
    and she stuck to him. Perhaps the only time he seemed cheerful and affectionate
    was when he had a few drinks in him. It was a miserable existence&mdash;a
    furnished room in a cheap lodging-house, and the use of the kitchen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He drank alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now a dipsomaniac mostly thinks he is in the right&mdash;except,
    perhaps, after he has been forced to be sober for a week. The noblest woman
    in the world couldn&rsquo;t save him&mdash;everything she does to reform
    him irritates him; but a strong friend can save him sometimes&mdash;a man
    who has been through it himself. The poor little wife of Gentleman Once went
    through it all. And she stuck to him. She went into low pubs after him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter shuddered again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She went through it all. He swore promises. He&rsquo;d come home
    sober and fill her with hope of future happiness, and swear that he&rsquo;d
    never take another glass. &lsquo;And we&rsquo;ll be happy yet, my poor boy,&rsquo; she&rsquo;d
    say, &lsquo;we&rsquo;ll be happy yet. I believe you, I trust you&rsquo; (she
    used to call him her &lsquo;bonny boy&rsquo;  when they were first married).
    And next night he&rsquo;d come home worse than ever. And one day he&mdash;he
    struck her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter shuddered, head and shoulders, like a man who had accidentally smashed
    his finger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And one day he struck her. He was sober when he did it&mdash;anyhow
    he had not taken drink for a week. A man is never sober who gets drunk more
    than once a week, though he might think he is. I don&rsquo;t know how it
    happened, but anyway he struck her, and that frightened him. He got a billet
    in the Civil Service up-country. No matter in what town it was. The little
    wife hoped for six months.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a cruel thing that a carelessly selfish young
    man cannot realize how a sensitive young wife suffers for months after he
    has reformed. How she hopes and fears, how she dreads the moment he has to
    leave her, and frets every hour he is away from home&mdash;and suffers mental
    agony when he is late. How the horror of the wretched old past time grows
    upon her until she dares not think of it. How she listens to his step and
    voice and watches his face, when he comes home, for a sign of drink. A young
    man, a mate of mine, who drank hard and reformed, used to take a delight
    in pretending for a few minutes to be drunk when he came home. He was goodhearted,
    but dense. He said he only did it to give his wife a pleasant surprise afterwards.
    I thought it one of the most cruel things I had ever seen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gentleman Once found that he could not stand the routine of office
    work and the dull life in that place. He commenced to drink again, and went
    on till he lost his billet. They had a little boy, a bright little boy, yet
    the father drank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last spree was a terrible one. He was away from home a fortnight,
    and in that fortnight he got down as deep as a man could get. Then another
    man got hold of him and set him on his feet, and straightened him up. The
    other man was a ruined doctor, a wreck whose devil was morphia. I don&rsquo;t
    hold that a man&rsquo;s salvation is always in his own hands; I&rsquo;ve
    seen mates pull mates out of hell too often to think that.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then Gentleman Once saw the past as he had never seen it before&mdash;he
    saw hope for the future with it. And he swore an oath that he felt he would
    keep.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He suffered from reaction on his way home, and, as he neared the
    town, a sudden fear, born of his nervous state, no doubt, sent a cold, sick
    emptiness through him: &lsquo;Was it too late?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As he turned into the street where he lived, he noticed a little
    group of bush larrikins standing at the corner. And they moved uneasily when
    they caught sight of him, and, as he passed, they touched and lifted their
    hats to him. Now he knew that he had lost the respect even of bush larrikins;
    and he knew enough of the bush to know that a bushman never lifts his hat
    to a man&mdash;only to death, and a woman sometimes. He hurried home and
    read the truth in his wife&rsquo;s eyes. His little boy was dead. He went
    down under the blow, and she held his head to her breast and kept saying, &lsquo;My
    poor boy, my poor boy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was he that she meant, not the boy she had lost. She knew him,
    she understood him better than he did himself, and, heart-broken as she was,
    she knew how he was going to suffer, and comforted him. &lsquo;My poor boy,
    my poor, foolish boy!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He mended the past, as far as he could, during the next two years,
    and she seemed happy. He was very gentle, he was very kind to her. He was
    happy, too, in a new, strange way. But he had learned what it was to suffer
    through his own fault, and now he was to learn what it was to suffer through
    no fault of his own, and without the consolation of saying &lsquo;I was wrong!
    I was to blame!&rsquo; At the end of the two years there was another child,
    and his wife died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The four sat silently smoking until Jack Barnes asked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what did he do then, Peter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; said Peter, abstractedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Gentleman Once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter roused himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve told the story, and it is about time to turn in,
    he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say exactly what Gentleman Once did when his
    wife died. He might have gone down to a deeper depth than Danny&rsquo;s.
    He might have risen higher than he had ever been before. From what I knew
    of his character he would never have gone down an easy slope as Danny has
    done. He might have dropped plump at first and then climbed up. Anyway, he
    had the memory of the last two years to help him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s the reformed drunkard who has trained himself
    to take a drink when he needs it, to drink in moderation&mdash;he&rsquo;s
    the strongest character of all, I think&mdash;but it&rsquo;s time to turn
    in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The cornet up the creek was playing a march.</p>
  <p>Peter walked across and looked at Danny, who seemed to be sleeping as peacefully
    as could be expected of him.</p>
  <p>Jack Barnes got up and walked slowly down the creek in the moonlight. He
    wanted to think.</p>
  <p>Peter rolled out his blankets on the grass and arranged his saddle-bags
    for a pillow. Before he turned in Mitchell shook hands with him, a most unusual
    and unnecessary proceeding in camp. But there&rsquo;s something in the bush
    grip which means &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Joe Wilson rolled out his blankets close to Mitchell&rsquo;s camp; he wanted
    to enjoy some of Mitchell&rsquo;s quiet humour before he went to sleep, but
    Mitchell wasn&rsquo;t in a philosophical mood. He wanted to reflect.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder who Gentleman Once was?&rdquo; said Joe to Mitchell. &ldquo;Could
    he have been Danny, or old Awful Example back there at the shanty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Mitchell. He puffed three long puffs at his pipe,
    and then said, reflectively</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard men tell their own stories before to-night Joe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was Joe who wanted to think now.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>About four o&rsquo;clock Mitchell woke and stood up. Peter was lying rolled
    in his blanket with his face turned to the west. The moon was low, the shadows
    had shifted back, and the light was on Peter&rsquo;s face. Mitchell stood
    looking at him reverently, as a grown son might who sees his father asleep
    for the first time. Then Mitchell quietly got some boughs and stuck them
    in the ground at a little distance from Peter&rsquo;s head, to shade his
    face from the bright moonlight; and then he turned in again to sleep till
    the sun woke him.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGhostsofManyChristmases"></a>The Ghosts of
      Many Christmases</b></h2>
  <p>Did&nbsp;you ever trace back your Christmas days?&mdash;right back to the
    days when you were innocent and Santa Claus was real. At times you thought
    you were very wicked, but you never realize how innocent you were until you&rsquo;ve
    grown up and knocked about the world.</p>
  <p>Let me think!</p>
  <p>Christmas in an English village, with bare hedges and trees, and leaden
    skies that lie heavy on our souls as we walk, with overcoat and umbrella,
    sons of English exiles and exiles in England, and think of bright skies and
    suns overhead, and sweeps of country disappearing into the haze, and blue
    mountain ranges melting into the azure of distant lower skies, and curves
    of white and yellow sand beaches, and runs of shelving yellow sandstone sea-walls&mdash;and
    the glorious Pacific! Sydney Harbour at sunrise, and the girls we took to
    Manly Beach.</p>
  <p>Christmas in a London flat. Gloom and slush and soot. It is not the cold
    that affects us Australians so much, but the horrible gloom. We get heart-sick
    for the sun.</p>
  <p>Christmas at sea&mdash;three Christmases, in fact&mdash;one going saloon
    from Sydney to Westralia early in the Golden Nineties with funds; and one,
    the Christmas after next, coming back steerage with nothing but the clothes
    we&rsquo;d slept in. All of which was bad judgment on our part&mdash;the
    order and manner of our going and coming should have been reversed.</p>
  <p>Christmas in a hessian tent in &ldquo;th&rsquo; Westren,&rdquo; with so
    many old mates from the East that it was just old times oven again. We had
    five pounds of corned beef and a kerosene-tin to boil it in; and while we
    were talking of old things the skeleton of a kangaroo-dog grabbed the beef
    out of the boiling water and disappeared into the scrub&mdash;which made
    it seem more like old times than ever.</p>
  <p>Christmas going to New Zealand, with experience, by the s.s.&nbsp;<i>Tasmania</i>.
    We had plum duff, but it was too &ldquo;soggy&rdquo; for us to eat. We dropped
    it overboard, lest it should swamp the boat&mdash;and it sank to the ooze.
    The&nbsp;<i>Tasmania</i>&nbsp;was saved on that occasion, but she foundered
    next year outside Gisborne. Perhaps the cook had made more duff. There was
    a letter from a sweetheart of mine amongst her mails when she went down;
    but that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with it, though it made some difference
    in my life.</p>
  <p>Christmas on a new telegraph line with a party of lining gangmen in New
    Zealand. There was no duff nor roast because there was no firewood within
    twenty miles. The cook used to pile armfuls of flax-sticks under the billies,
    and set light to them when the last man arrived in camp.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Sydney, with a dozen invitations out to dinner. The one we
    accepted was to a sensible Australian Christmas dinner; a typical one, as
    it should be, and will be before the Commonwealth is many years old. Everything
    cold except the vegetables, the hose playing on the veranda and vines outside,
    the men dressed in sensible pyjama-like suits, and the women and girls fresh
    and cool and jolly, instead of being hot and cross and looking like boiled
    carrots, and feeling like boiled rags, and having headaches after dinner,
    as would have been the case had they broiled over the fire in a hot kitchen
    all the blazing forenoon to cook a scalding, indigestible dinner, as many
    Australian women do, and for no other reason than that it was the fashion
    in England. One of those girls was very pretty and&mdash;ah, well!&mdash;</p>
  <p>Christmas dinner in a greasy Sydney sixpenny restaurant, that opened a few
    days before with brass band going at full blast at the door by way of advertisement. &ldquo;Roast-beef,
    one! Cabbage and potatoes, one! Plum pudding, two!&rdquo; (That was the first
    time I dined to music.) The Christmas dinner was a good one, but my appetite
    was spoilt by the expression of the restaurant keeper, a big man with a heavy
    jowl, who sat by the door with a cold eye on the sixpences, and didn&rsquo;t
    seem to have much confidence in human nature.</p>
  <p>Christmas&mdash;no, that was New Year&mdash;on the Warrego River, out back
    (an alleged river with a sickly stream that looked like bad milk). We spent
    most of that night hunting round in the dark and feeling on the ground for
    camel and horse droppings with which to build fires and make smoke round
    our camp to keep off the mosquitoes. The mosquitoes started at sunset and
    left off at daybreak, when the flies got to work again.</p>
  <p>Christmas dinner under a brush shearing-shed. Mutton and plum pudding&mdash;and
    fifty miles from beer!</p>
  <p>An old bush friend of mine, one Jimmy Nowlett, who ranked as a bullock-driver,
    told me of a Christmas time he had. He was cut off by the floods with his
    team, and had nothing to eat for four days but potatoes and honey. He said
    potatoes dipped in honey weren&rsquo;t so bad; but he had to sleep on bullock
    yokes laid on the ground to keep him out of the water, and he got a toothache
    that paralysed him all down one side.</p>
  <p>And speaking of plum pudding, I consider it one of the most barbarous institutions
    of the British. It is a childish, silly, savage superstition; it must have
    been a savage inspiration, looking at it all round&mdash;but then it isn&rsquo;t
    so long since the British were savages.</p>
  <p>I got a letter last year from a mate of mine in Western Australia&mdash;prospecting
    the awful desert out beyond White Feather&mdash;telling me all about a &ldquo;perish&rdquo; he
    did on plum pudding. He and his mates were camped at the Boulder Soak with
    some three or four hundred miles&mdash;mostly sand and dust&mdash;between
    them and the nearest grocer&rsquo;s shop. They ordered a case of mixed canned
    provisions from Perth to reach them about Christmas. They didn&rsquo;t believe
    in plum pudding&mdash;there are a good many British institutions that bushmen
    don&rsquo;t believe in&mdash;but the cook was a new chum, and he said he&rsquo;d
    go home to his mother if he didn&rsquo;t have plum pudding for Christmas,
    so they ordered a can for him. Meanwhile, they hung out on kangaroo and damper
    and the knowledge that it couldn&rsquo;t last for ever. It was in a terrible
    drought, and the kangaroos used to come into the &ldquo;Soak&rdquo; for water,
    and they were too weak to run. Later on, when wells were dug, the kangaroos
    used to commit suicide in them&mdash;there was generally a kangaroo in the
    well in the morning.</p>
  <p>The storekeeper packed the case of tinned dog, etc., but by some blunder
    he or his man put the label on the wrong box, and it went per rail, per coach,
    per camel, and the last stage per boot, and reached my friends&rsquo; camp
    on Christmas Eve, to their great joy. My friend broke the case open by the
    light of the camp-fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here, Jack!&rdquo; he said, tossing out a can, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
    your plum pudding.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held the next can in his hand a moment longer and read the label twice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! he&rsquo;s sent two,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m sure
    I only ordered one. Never mind&mdash;Jack&rsquo;ll have a tuck-out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He held the next can close to the fire and blinked at it hard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m damned if he hasn&rsquo;t sent three tins of plum pudding.
    Never mind, we&rsquo;ll manage to scoff some of it between us. You&rsquo;re
    in luck&rsquo;s way this trip, Jack, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He looked harder still at the fourth can; then he read the labels on the
    other tins again to see if he&rsquo;d made a mistake.</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t tell me what he said then, but a milder mate suggested that
    the storekeeper had sent half a dozen tins by mistake. But when they reached
    the seventh can the language was not even fit to be written down on a piece
    of paper and handed up to the magistrate. The storekeeper had sent them an
    unbroken case of canned plum pudding, and probably by this time he was wondering
    what had become of that blanky case of duff.</p>
  <p>The kangaroos disappeared about this time and my friend tells me that he
    and his mates had to live for a mortal fortnight on canned plum pudding.
    They tried it cold and they tried it boiled, they tried it baked, they had
    it fried, and they had it toasted, they had it for breakfast, dinner and
    tea. They had nothing else to think, or talk, or argue and quarrel about;
    and they dreamed about it every night, my friend says. It wasn&rsquo;t a
    joke&mdash;it gave them the nightmare and day-horrors.</p>
  <p>They tried it with salt. They picked as many of the raisins out as they
    could and boiled it with salt kangaroo. They tried to make Yorkshire pudding
    out of it; but it was too rich.</p>
  <p>My friend was experimenting and trying to discover a simple process for
    separating the ingredients of plum pudding when a fresh supply of provisions
    came along. He says he was never so sick of anything in his life, and he
    has had occasion to be sick of a good many things.</p>
  <p>The new-chum jackeroo is still alive, but he won&rsquo;t ever eat plum pudding
    any more, he says. It cured him of home-sickness. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat it
    even if his bride made it.</p>

  <p>Christmas on the goldfields in the last of the roaring days, in the palmy
    days of Gulgong and those fields. Let&rsquo;s see! it must be nearly thirty
    years ago! Oh, how the time goes by!</p>
  <p>Santa Claus, young, fresh-faced and eager; Santa Claus, blonde and flaxen;
    Santa Claus, dark; Santa Claus with a brogue and Santa Claus speaking broken
    English; Santa Claus as a Chinaman (Sun Tong Lee &amp; Co. storekeepers),
    with strange, delicious sweets that melted in our mouths, and rum toys and
    Chinese dolls for the children.</p>
  <p>Lucky diggers who were with difficulty restrained from putting pound notes
    and nuggets and expensive lockets and things into the little ones&rsquo;  stockings.
    Santa Claus in flannel shirt and clay-covered moleskins. Diggers who bought
    lollies by the pound and sent the little ones home with as much as they could
    carry.</p>
  <p>Diggers who gave a guinea or more for a toy for a child that reminded them
    of some other child at home. Diggers who took as many children as they could
    gather on short notice into a store, slapped a five-pound note down on the
    counter and told the little ones to call for whatever they wanted. Who set
    a family of poor children side by side on the counter and called for a box
    of mixed children&rsquo;s boots&mdash;the best-and fitted them on with great
    care and anxiety and frequent inquiries as to whether they pinched. Who stood
    little girls and boys on the counter and called for the most expensive frocks,
    the latest and best in sailor suits, and the brightest ribbons; and things
    came long distances by bullock dray and were expensive in those days. Impressionable
    diggers&mdash;and most of them were&mdash;who threw nuggets to singers, and
    who, sometimes, slipped a parcel into the hands of a little boy or girl,
    with instructions to give it to an elder sister (or young mother, perhaps)
    whom the digger had never spoken to, only worshipped from afar off. And the
    elder sister or young mother, opening the parcel, would find a piece of jewellery
    or a costly article of dress, and wonder who sent it.</p>
  <p>Ah, the wild generosity of luck-intoxicated diggers of those days! and the
    reckless generosity of the drinkers. &ldquo;We thought it was going to last
    for ever!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t spend it on the bairns I&rsquo;ll spend it on the
    drink,&rdquo;  Sandy Burns used to say. &ldquo;I ha&rsquo; nane o&rsquo; me
    own, an&rsquo; the lass who was to gi&rsquo; me bairns, she couldn&rsquo;t
    wait.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Sandy had kept steady and travelled from one end of the world to the other,
    and roughed it and toiled for five years, and the very day he bottomed his
    golden hole on the Brown Snake Lead at Happy Valley he got a letter from
    his girl in Scotland to say she had grown tired of waiting and was married.
    Then he drank, and drink and luck went together.</p>
  <p>Gulgong on New Year&rsquo;s Eve! Rows and rows of lighted tents and camp-fires,
    with a clear glow over it all. Bonfires on the hills and diggers romping
    round them like big boys. Tin kettling&mdash;gold dishes and spoons, and
    fiddles, and hammers on pointing anvils, and sticks and empty kerosene-tins
    (<i>they</i>&nbsp;made a row); concertinas and cornets, shot-guns, pistols
    and crackers, all sorts of instruments, and &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; in
    one mighty chorus.</p>
  <p>And now&mdash;a wretched little pastoral town; a collection of glaring corrugated-iron
    hip-roofs, and maybe a rotting propped-up bark or weather-board humpy or
    two&mdash;relics of the roaring days; a dried-up storekeeper and some withered
    hags; a waste of caved-in holes with rain-washed mullock heaps and quartz
    and gravel glaring in the sun; thistles and burrs where old bars were; drought,
    dryness, desolation and goats.</p>
  <p>Lonely graves in the bush and grey old diggers here and there, anywhere
    in the world, doing anything for a living, lonely yet because of the girls
    who couldn&rsquo;t wait, but prospecting and fossicking here and there, and
    dreaming still.</p>
  <p>They thought it was going to last for ever.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>Christmas at Eurunderee Creek, amongst the old selection farms in the western
    spurs of the Blue Mountains. They used to call it &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Pipeclay&rdquo;  thirty
    years ago, but the old black names have been restored. They make plum puddings
    yet, weeks beforehand, and boil them for hours and hang them in cloths to
    the rafters to petrify; then they take them down and boil them again. On
    Christmas Eve the boys cut boughs or young pines on the hills, and drag them
    home and lash them to the veranda-posts.</p>
  <p>Ted has turned up with his wife and children from his selection out back.
    The wheat is in and shearing is over on the big stations. Tom&mdash;steady-going
    old Tom&mdash;clearing or fencing or dam-sinking up-country, hides his tools
    in the scrub and gets his horse and rides home. Aunt Emma (to everyone&rsquo;s
    joy) has arrived from Sydney with presents (astonishing bargains in frocks,
    etc.) and marvellous descriptions of town life.</p>
  <p>Joe, &ldquo;poor&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s husband, who has been droving in Queensland
    since the Christmas before last&mdash;while poor Mary, who is afraid to live
    alone, shared a skillion and the family quarrels at home&mdash;Joe rides
    day and night and reaches home at sunrise on Christmas morning, tired and
    dusty, gaunt and haggard, but with his last cheque intact. He kisses his
    wife and child and throws himself on the bed to sleep till dinner-time, while
    Mary moves round softly, hushes the baby, dresses it and herself, lays out
    Joe&rsquo;s clean things, and bends over him now and then, and kisses him,
    perhaps, as he sleeps.</p>
  <p>In the morning the boys and some of the men go down to the creek for a swim
    in the big shady pool under the she-oaks and take their Sunday clothes with
    them and dress there.</p>
  <p>Some of them ride into town to church, and some of the women and children
    drive in in spring-carts&mdash;the children to go to Sunday school, leaving
    mother and the eldest daughter&mdash;usually a hard-worked, disappointed,
    short-tempered girl&mdash;at home to look after the cooking.</p>
  <p>There is some anxiety (mostly on mother&rsquo;s part) about Jim, who is  &ldquo;wild,&rdquo; and
    is supposed to be somewhere out back. There was &ldquo;a piece of blue paper&rdquo; out
    for Jim on account of sweating (illegally using) a horse, but his mother
    or father has got a hint&mdash;given in a kindly way by the police-sergeant&mdash;that
    Jim is free to come home and stay at home if he behaves himself. (There is
    usually a horse missing when Jim goes out back.)</p>
  <p>Jim turns up all right&mdash;save that he has no money&mdash;and is welcomed
    with tearful affection by his favourite sister Mary, shakes hands silently
    with his father, and has a long whispered conversation with his mother, which
    leaves him very subdued. His brothers forbear to sneer at him, partly because
    it is Christmas, partly on mother&rsquo;s account, and thirdly, because Jim
    can use his hands. Aunt Emma, who is fond of him, cheers him up wonderfully.</p>
  <p>The family sit down to dinner. &ldquo;An old mate of your father&rsquo;s&rdquo;&mdash;a
    bearded old digger&mdash;has arrived and takes the place of honour. (&rdquo;I
    knowed yer father, sonny, on the diggings long afore any of you was ever
    thought on.&rdquo;)</p>
  <p>The family have only been a few hours together, yet there is an undercurrent
    of growling, that, to the stranger, mysterious yet evident undercurrent of
    nastiness and resentment which goes on in all families and drags many a promising
    young life down. But Aunt Emma and the old mate make things brighter, and
    so the dinner&mdash;of hot roast and red-hot plum pudding&mdash;passes off
    fairly well.</p>
  <p>The men sleep the afternoon away and wake up bathed in perspiration and
    helpless; some of the women have headaches. After tea they gather on the
    veranda in the cool of the evening, and that&rsquo;s the time when the best
    sides of their natures and the best parts of the past have a chance of coming
    uppermost, and perhaps they begin to feel a bit sorry that they are going
    to part again.</p>
  <p>The local races or &ldquo;sports&rdquo; on Boxing Day. There is nothing
    to keep the boys home over New Year. Ted and his wife go back to their lonely
    life on their selection; Tom returns to his fencing or tank-sinking contract;
    Jim, who has borrowed &ldquo;a couple of quid&rdquo; from Tom, goes out back
    with strong resolutions for the New Year, and shears &ldquo;stragglers,&rdquo; breaks
    in horses, cooks and clerks for survey parties, and gambles and drinks, and
    gets into trouble again. Maybe Joe &ldquo;knocks about&rdquo; the farm a
    bit before going into the Great North-West with another mob of cattle.</p>
  <p>The last time I saw the Old Year out at Eurunderee the bushfires were burning
    all over the ranges, and looked like great cities lighted up. No need for
    bonfires then.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Bourke, the metropolis of the great pastoral scrubs and plains,
    five hundred miles west, with the thermometer one-hundred-and-something-scarey
    in the shade. The rough, careless shearers come in from stations many dusty
    miles out in the scrubs to have their Christmas sprees, to drink and &ldquo;shout&rdquo; and
    fight&mdash;and have the horrors some of them&mdash;and be run in and locked
    up with difficulty, within sound of a church-going bell.</p>
  <p>The Bourke Christmas is a very beery and exciting one. The hotels shut up
    in front on Christmas Day to satisfy the law (or out of consideration for
    the feelings of the sergeant in charge of the police station), and open behind
    to satisfy the public, who are supposed to have made the law.</p>
  <p>Sensible cold dinners are the fashion in Bourke, I think, with the hose
    going, and free-and-easy costumes.</p>
  <p>The free males take their blankets and sleep in the &ldquo;park;&rdquo; the
    women sleep with doors and windows open, and the married men on mattresses
    on the verandas across the open doors&mdash;in case of accidents.</p>
  <p>Christmas in Sydney, though Christmas holidays are not so popular as Easter,
    or even Anniversary Day, in the Queen city of the South. Buses, electric,
    cable and the old steam trams crowded with holiday-makers with baskets. Harbour
    boats loaded down to the water&rsquo;s edge with harbour picnic-parties. &ldquo;A
    trip round the harbour and to the head of Middle Harbour one shilling return!&rdquo; Strings
    of tourist trains running over the Blue Mountains and the Great Zigzag, and
    up the coast to Gosford and Brisbane Water, and down the south coast to beautiful
    Illawarra, until after New Year. Hundreds of young fellows going out with
    tents to fish in lonely bays or shoot in the mountains, and rough it properly
    like bushmen&mdash;not with deck chairs, crockery, a piano and servants.
    For you can camp in the grand and rugged solitude of the bush within a stone&rsquo;s
    throw of the city, so to speak.</p>
  <p>Jolly camps and holiday parties all round the beautiful bays of the harbour,
    and up and down the coast, and all close to home. Camps in the moonlight
    on sandy beaches under great dark bluffs and headlands, where yellow, shelving,
    sandstone cliffs run, broken only by sandy-beached bays, and where the silver-white
    breakers leap and roar.</p>
  <p>And Manly Beach on a holiday! Thousands of people in fresh summer dress,
    hundreds of bare-legged, happy children running where the &ldquo;blue sea
    over the white sand rolls,&rdquo; racing in and out with the rollers, playing
    with the glorious Pacific. Manly&mdash;&ldquo;Our Village&rdquo;&mdash;Manly
    Beach, where we used to take our girls, with the most beautiful harbour in
    the world on one side, and the width of the grandest ocean on the other.
    Ferny gullies and &ldquo;fairy dells&rdquo; to north and south, and every
    shady nook its merry party or happy couple.</p>
  <p>Manly Beach&mdash;I remember five years ago (oh, how the time goes by!)&mdash;and
    two names that were written together in the sand when the tide was coming
    in.</p>
  <p>And the boat home in the moonlight, past the Heads, where we felt the roll
    of the ocean, and the moonlit harbour&mdash;and the harbour lights of Sydney&mdash;the
    grandest of them all.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h1 align="center"><b>The Rising of the Court </b></h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheRisingoftheCourt"></a>The Rising of the Court</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Oh, then tell us, Kings and Judges, where our meeting is to
    be,<br>
    When the laws of men are nothing, and our spirits all are free&mdash;<br>
    When the laws of men are nothing, and no wealth can hold the fort,<br>
    There&rsquo;ll be thirst for mighty brewers at the Rising of the Court.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;The same&nbsp;dingy court room, deep and dim, like a well, with the
    clock high up on the wall, and the doors low down in it; with the bench,
    which, with some gilding, might be likened to a gingerbread imitation of
    a throne; the royal arms above it and the little witness box to one side,
    where so many honest poor people are bullied, insulted and laughed at by
    third-rate blackguardly little &ldquo;lawyers,&rdquo; and so many pitiful,
    pathetic and noble lies are told by pitiful sinners and disreputable heroes
    for a little liberty for a lost self, or for the sake of a friend&mdash;of
    a &ldquo;pal&rdquo; or a &ldquo;cobber.&rdquo; The same overworked and underpaid
    magistrate trying to keep his attention fixed on the same old miserable scene
    before him; as a weary, overworked and underpaid journalist or author strives
    to keep his attention fixed on his proofs. The same row of big, strong, healthy,
    good-natured policemen trying not to grin at times; and the police-court
    solicitors (&ldquo;the place stinks with &rsquo;em,&rdquo; a sergeant told
    me) wrangling over some miserable case for a crust, and the &ldquo;reporters,&rdquo; shabby
    some of them, eager to get a brutal joke for their papers out of the accumulated
    mass of misery before them, whether it be at the expense of the deaf; blind,
    or crippled man, or the alien.</p>
  <p>And opposite the bench, the dock, divided by a partition, with the women
    to the left and the men to the right, as it is on the stairs or the block
    in polite society. They bring children here no longer. The same shaking,
    wild-eyed, blood-shot-eyed and blear-eyed drunks and disorderlies, though
    some of the women have nerves yet; and the same decently dressed, but trembling
    and conscience-stricken little wretch up for petty larceny or something,
    whose motor car bosses of a big firm have sent a solicitor, &ldquo;manager,&rdquo; or
    some understrapper here to prosecute and give evidence.</p>
  <p>But, over there, on a form to one side of the bench&mdash;opposite the witness
    box&mdash;and as the one bright spot in this dark, and shameful, and useless
    scene&mdash;and in a patch of sunlight from the skylight as it happens&mdash;sit
    representatives of the Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Society, Prison Gate and Rescue
    Brigades, etc. (one or two of the ladies in nurses&rsquo; uniforms), who
    are come to help us and to fight for us against the Law of their Land and
    of ours, God help us!</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson, of Red Rock Lane, is here, and her rival in revolution, One-Eyed
    Kate, and Cock-Eyed Sal, and one or two of the other aristocrats of the alley.
    And the weeping bedraggled remains of what was once, and not so long ago,
    a pretty, slight, fair-haired and blue-eyed Australian girl. She is up for
    inciting One-Eyed Kate to resist the police. Also, Three-Pea Ginger, Stousher,
    and Wingy, for some participation in the row amongst the aforementioned ladies.
    (Wingy, by the way, is a ratty little one-armed man, whose case is usually
    described in the head-line, as &ldquo;A &rsquo;Armless Case,&rdquo; by one
    of our great dailies.) And their pals are waiting outside in the vestibule&mdash;Frowsy
    Kate (The Red Streak), Boko Bill, Pincher and his &ldquo;piece,&rdquo;  etc.,
    getting together the stuff for the possible fines, and the ten-bob fee for
    the lawyer, in one case, and ready to swear to anything, if called upon.
    And I myself&mdash;though I have not yet entered Red Rock Lane Society&mdash;on
    bail, on a charge of &ldquo;plain drunk.&rdquo; It was &ldquo;drunk and disorderly&rdquo; by
    the way, but a kindly sergeant changed it to plain drunk(though I always
    thought my drunk was ornamental).</p>
  <p>Yet I am not ashamed&mdash;only comfortably dulled and a little tired&mdash;dully
    interested and observant, and hopeful for the sunlight presently. We low
    persons get too great a contempt for things to feel much ashamed at any time;
    and this very contempt keeps many of us from &ldquo;reforming.&rdquo; We
    hear too many lies sworn that we&nbsp;<i>know</i>&nbsp;to be lies, and see
    too many unjust and brutal things done that we know to be brutal and unjust.</p>
  <p>But let us go back a bit, and suppose we are still waiting for the magistrate,
    and think of Last Night. &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo;&rsquo;but from no human voice
    this time. The whispering, shuffling, and clicking of the court typewriter
    ceases, the scene darkens, and the court is blotted out as a scene is blotted
    out from the sight of a man who has thrown himself into a mesmeric trance.
    And:</p>
  <p>Drink&mdash;lurid recollection of being &ldquo;searched&rdquo;&mdash;clang
    of iron cell door, and I grope for and crawl on to the slanting plank. Period
    of oblivion&mdash;or the soul is away in some other world. Clang of cell
    door again, and soul returns in a hurry to take heed of another soul, belonging
    to a belated drunk on the plank by my side. Other soul says:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gotta match?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So we&rsquo;re not in hell yet.</p>
  <p>We fumble and light up. They leave us our pipes, tobacco and matches; presently,
    one knocks with his pipe on the iron trap of the door and asks for water,
    which is brought in a tin pint-pot. Then follow intervals of smoking, incoherent
    mutterings that pass for conversation, borrowings of matches, knockings with
    the pannikin on the cell door wicket or trap for more water, matches, and
    bail; false and fitful starts into slumber perhaps&mdash;or wild attempts
    at flight on the part of our souls into that other world that the sober and
    sane know nothing of; and, gradually, suddenly it seems, reason (if this
    world is reasonable) comes back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. Bomb outrage, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Drunk?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s yours?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Same boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But presently he is plainly uneasy (and I am getting that way, too, to tell
    the truth), and, after moving about, and walking up and down in the narrow
    space as well as we can, he &ldquo;rings up&rdquo; another policeman, who
    happens to be the fat one who is to be in charge all night.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s up here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What have I been up to?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Killin&rsquo; a Chinaman. Go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Policeman peers in at me inquiringly, but I forbear to ask questions.</p>
  <p>Blankets are thrown in by a friend of mine in the force, though we are not
    entitled to them until we are bailed or removed to the &ldquo;paddock&rdquo; (the
    big drunks&rsquo; dormitory and dining cell at the Central), and we proceed
    to make ourselves comfortable. My mate wonders whether he asked them to send
    to his wife to get bail, and hopes he didn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>They have left our wicket open, seeing, or rather hearing, that we are quiet.
    But they have seemingly left some other wickets open also, for from a neighbouring
    cell comes the voice of Mrs Johnson holding forth. The locomotive has apparently
    just been run into the cleaning sheds, and her fires have not had time to
    cool. They say that Mrs Johnson was a &ldquo;lady once,&rdquo; like many
    of her kind; that she is not a &ldquo;bad woman&rdquo;&mdash;that is, not
    a woman of loose character&mdash;but gets money sent to her from somewhere&mdash;from
    her &ldquo;family,&rdquo; or her husband, perhaps. But when she lets herself
    loose&mdash;or, rather, when the beer lets her loose&mdash;she is a tornado
    and a terror in Red Rock Lane, and it is only her fierce, practical kindness
    to her unfortunate or poverty-stricken sisters in her sober moments that
    keeps her forgiven in that classic thoroughfare. She can certainly speak &ldquo;like
    a lady&rdquo; when she likes, and like an intelligent, even a clever, woman&mdash;not
    like a &ldquo;woman of the world,&rdquo; but as a woman who knew and knows
    the world, and is in hell. But now her language is the language of a rough
    shearer in a &ldquo;rough shed&rdquo; on a blazing hot day.</p>
  <p>After a while my mate calls out to her:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake give it a rest!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Whereupon Mrs Johnson straightway opens on him and his ancestry, and his
    mental, moral, and physical condition&mdash;especially the latter. She accuses
    him of every crime known to Christian countries and some Asiatic and ancient
    ones. She wants to know how long he has been out of jail for kicking his
    wife to pieces that time when she was up as a witness against him, and whether
    he is in for the same thing again? (She has never set eyes on him, by the
    way, nor he on her.)</p>
  <p>He calls back that she is not a respectable woman, and he knows all about
    her.</p>
  <p>Thereupon she shrieks at him and bangs and kicks at her door, and demands
    his name and address. It would appear that she is a respectable woman, and
    hundreds can prove it, and she is going to make him prove it in open court.</p>
  <p>He calls back that his name is Percy Reginald Grainger, and his town residence
    is &ldquo;The Mansions,&rdquo; Macleay Street, next to Mr Isaacs, the magistrate,
    and he also gives her the address of his solicitor.</p>
  <p>She bangs and shrieks again, and states that she will get his name from
    the charge sheet in the morning and have him up for criminal libel, and have
    his cell mate up as a witness&mdash;and hers, too. But just here a policeman
    comes along and closes her wicket with a bang and cuts her off, so that her
    statements become indistinct, or come only as shrieks from a lost soul in
    an underground dungeon. He also threatens to cut us off and smother us if
    we don&rsquo;t shut up. I wonder whether they&rsquo;ve got her in the padded
    cell.</p>
  <p>We settle down again, but presently my fellow captive nudges me and says: &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; From
    another cell comes the voice of a woman singing&mdash;the girl who is in
    for &ldquo;inciting to resist, your worship,&rdquo; in fact. &ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he
    says, &ldquo;that woman could sing once.&rdquo; Her voice is low and sweet
    and plaintive, as of a woman who had been a singer but had lost her voice.
    And what do you think it is?</p>
  <p class="note">The crowd in accents hushed reply&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson&rsquo;s cell is suddenly silent. Then, not mimickingly, mockingly,
    or scornfully, but as if the girl is a champion of Jesus of Nazareth, and
    is hurt at the ignorance of the multitude, and pities&nbsp;<i>Him</i>:</p>
  <p class="note">Now who is this Jesus of Nazareth, say?</p>
  <p>The policeman, coming along the passage, closes the wicket in her door,
    but softly this time, and not before we catch the plaintive words again.</p>
  <p class="note">The crowd in accents hushed reply&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Jesus of Nazareth passeth by.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>My fellow felon throws the blanket off him impatiently, sits up with a jerk,
    and gropes for his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But this is red hot! Have you got another
    match?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I wonder what the Nazarene would have to say about it.</p>
  <p>Sleep for a while. I wonder whether they&rsquo;ll give us time, or we&rsquo;ll
    be able to sleep some of our sins off in the end, as we sleep our drink off
    here? Then &ldquo;The Paddock&rdquo; and daylight; but there&rsquo;s little
    time for the Paddock here, for we must soon be back in court. The men borrow
    and lend and divide tobacco, lend even pipes, while some break up hard tobacco
    and roll cigarettes with bits of newspaper. If it is Sunday morning, even
    those who have no hope for bail, and have a long horrible day and night before
    them, will sometimes join in a cheer as the more fortunate are bailed. But
    the others have tea and bread and butter brought to them by one of the Prisoners&rsquo; Aid
    Societies, who ask for no religion in return. They come to save bodies, and
    not to fish for souls. The men walk up and down and to and fro, and cross
    and recross incessantly, as caged men and animals always do&mdash;and as
    some uncaged men do too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any of you gentlemen want breakfast?&rdquo; Those who have money
    and appetites order; some order for the sake of the tea alone; and some &ldquo;shout&rdquo; two
    or three extra breakfasts for those who had nothing on them when they were
    run in. We low people can be very kind to each other in trouble. But now
    it&rsquo;s time to call us out by the lists, marshal us up in the passage,
    and draft us into court. Ladies first. But I forgot that I am out on bail,
    and that the foregoing belongs to another occasion. Or was it only imagination,
    or hearsay? Journalists have got themselves run in before now, in order to
    see and hear and feel and smell for themselves&mdash;and write.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silence! Order in the Court.&rdquo; I come like a shot out of my
    nightmare, or trance, or what you will, and we all rise as the magistrate
    takes his seat. None of us noticed him come in, but he&rsquo;s there, and
    I&rsquo;ve a quaint idea that he bowed to his audience. Kindly, humorous
    Mr Isaacs, whom we have lost, always gave me that idea. And, while he looks
    over his papers, the women seem to group themselves, unconsciously as it
    were, with Mrs Johnson as front centre, as though they depended on her in
    some vague way. She has slept it off and tidied, or been tidied, up, and
    is as clear-headed as she ever will be. Crouching directly behind her, supported
    and comforted on one side by One-Eyed Kate, and on the other by Cock-Eyed
    Sal, is the poor bedraggled little resister of the Law, sobbing convulsively,
    her breasts and thin shoulders heaving and shaking under her openwork blouse&mdash;the
    girl who seemed to pity Jesus of Nazareth last night in her cell. There&rsquo;s
    very little inciting to resist about her now. Most women can cry when they
    like, I know, and many have cried men to jail and the gallows; but&nbsp;<i>here</i>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>this
    place</i>, if a woman&rsquo;s tears can avail her anything, who, save perhaps
    a police-court solicitor and gentleman-by-Act-of-Parliament, would, or dare,
    raise a sneer.</p>
  <p>I wonder what the Nazarene would have to say about it if He came in to speak
    for her. But probably they&rsquo;d send Him to the receiving house as a person
    of unsound mind, or give Him worse punishment for drunkenness and contempt
    of court.</p>
  <p>His Worship looks up.</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson (from the dock): &ldquo;Good morning, Mr Isaacs. How do you
    do? You&rsquo;re looking very well this morning, Mr Isaacs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His Worship (from the Bench): &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs Johnson. I&rsquo;m feeling
    very well this morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a pause, but there is no &ldquo;laughter.&rdquo; The would
    be satellites don&rsquo;t know whom the laugh might be against. His Worship
    bends over the papers again, and I can see that he is having trouble with
    that quaintly humorous and kindly smile, or grin, of his. He has as hard
    a job to control his smile and get it off his face as some magistrates have
    to get a smile on to theirs. And there&rsquo;s a case coming by and by that
    he&rsquo;ll have to look a bit serious over. However&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jane Johnson!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson is here present, and reminds the Sergeant that she is.</p>
  <p>Then begins, or does begin in most courts, the same dreary old drone, like
    the giving out of a hymn, of the same dreary old charge:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&mdash;Are&mdash;Charged&mdash;With&mdash;Being&mdash;Drunk&mdash;And&mdash;Disorderly&mdash;In&mdash;Such&mdash;And&mdash;Such&mdash;A&mdash;Street&mdash;How&mdash;Do&mdash;You&mdash;Plead&mdash;Guilty&mdash;Or&mdash;Not&mdash;Guilty?&rdquo;  But
    they are less orthodox here. The &ldquo;disorderly&rdquo; has dropped out
    of Mrs Johnson&rsquo;s charge somehow, on the way from the charge room&mdash;I
    don&rsquo;t know what has been going on behind the scenes, but, anyway, it
    is Christmas-time, and the Sergeant seems anxious to let Mrs Johnson off
    lightly. It means anything from twenty-four hours or five shillings to three
    months on the Island for her. The lawyers and the police&mdash;especially
    the lawyers&mdash;are secretly afraid of Mrs Johnson.</p>
  <p>However, again&mdash;</p>
  <p>The Sergeant: &ldquo;This woman has not been here for six weeks, your Worship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Johnson (who has him set and has been waiting for him for a year or
    so): &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a damned lie, Mr Isaacs. I was here last Wednesday!&rdquo; Then,
    after a horrified pause in the Court &ldquo;But I beg&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;pardon,
    Mr Isaacs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His Worship&rsquo;s head goes down again. The &ldquo;laughter&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t
    come here, either. There is a whispered consultation, and (it being Christmas-time)
    they compromise with Mrs Johnson for &ldquo;five shillings or the risin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and
    she thanks his Worship and is escorted out, rather more hurriedly than is
    comportable with her dignity, for she remarks about it.</p>
  <p>The members of the Johnsonian sisterhood have reason to be thankful for
    the &ldquo;lift&rdquo; she has given them, for they all get off lightly,
    and even the awful resister of Law-an&rsquo;-order is forgiven. Mrs Johnson
    has money and is waiting outside to stand beers for them; she always shouts
    for the boys when she has it. And&mdash;what good does it all do?</p>
  <p>It is very hard to touch the heart of a woman who is down, though they are
    intensely sympathetic amongst themselves. It is nearly as hard as it is to
    combat the pride of a hard-working woman in poverty. It was such women as
    Mrs Johnson, One-Eyed Kate, and their sisters who led Paris to Versailles,
    and a King and a Queen died for it. It is such women as Mrs Johnson and One-Eyed
    Kate and their sisters who will lead a greater Paris to a greater Versailles
    some day, and many &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; kings and queens, and their princes
    and princesses shall die for it. And that reminds me of two reports in a
    recent great daily:</p>
  <p class="note">Miss Angelina De Tapps, the youngest daughter of the well-known
    great family of brewers, was united in the holy bonds of matrimony to Mr
    Reginald Wells&mdash;(here follows a long account of the smart society wedding).
    The happy pair leave en route for Europe per the &mdash;&mdash; next Friday.</p>
  <p class="note">Jane Johnson, an old offender, again faced the music before
    Mr Isaacs, S.M., at the Central yesterday morning&mdash;(here follows a &ldquo;humorous&rdquo; report
    of the case).</p>
  <p>Next time poor Mrs Johnson will leave en route for &ldquo;Th&rsquo; Island&rdquo;  and
    stay there three months.</p>
  <p>The sisters join Mrs Johnson, who has some money and takes them to a favourite
    haunt and shouts for them&mdash;as she does for the boys sometimes. Their
    opinions on civilization are not to be printed.</p>
  <p>Ginger and Wingy get off with the option, and, though the fine is heavy,
    it is paid. They adjourn with Boko Bill, and their politics are lurid.</p>
  <p>Squinny Peters (plain drunk-five bob or the risin&rsquo;), who is peculiar
    for always paying his fine, elects to take it out this time. It appears that
    the last time Squinny got five bob or the risin&rsquo; he ante&rsquo;d up
    the splosh like a man, and the court rose immediately, to Squinny&rsquo;s
    intense disgust. He isn&rsquo;t taking any chances this time.</p>
  <p>Wild-Flowers-Charley, who recently did a fortnight, and has been out on
    bail, has had a few this morning, and, in spite of warnings from and promises
    to friends, insists on making a statement, though by simply pleading guilty
    he might get off easily. The statement lasts some ten minutes. Mr Isaacs
    listens patiently and politely and remarks:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fourteen days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Charley saw the humour of it afterwards, he says.</p>
  <p>But what good does it all do?</p>
  <p>I had no wish to treat drunkenness frivolously in beginning this sketch;
    I have seen women in the horrors&mdash;that ought to be enough.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="RollUpatTalbragar"></a>&ldquo;Roll Up at Talbragar&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Jack Denver died at Talbragar when Christmas Eve began,<br>
    And there was sorrow round the place, for Denver was a man;<br>
    Jack Denver&rsquo;s wife bowed down her head&mdash;her daughter&rsquo;s grief
    was wild,<br>
    And big Ben Duggan by the bed stood sobbing like a child.<br>
    But big Ben Duggan saddled up, and galloped fast and far,<br>
    To raise the longest funeral ever seen on Talbragar.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;<i>Ben Duggan.</i></p>
  <p>Both&nbsp;funerals belonged to Big Ben Duggan in a way, though Jack Denver
    was indirectly the cause of both.</p>
  <p>Jack Denver was reckoned the most popular man in the district (outside the
    principal township)&mdash;a white man and a straight man&mdash;a white boss
    and a straight sportsman. He was a squatter, though a small one; a real squatter
    who lived on his run and worked with his men&mdash;no dummy, super, manager
    for a bank, or swollen cockatoo about Jack Denver. He was on the committees
    at agricultural shows and sports, great at picnics and dances, beloved by
    school children at school feasts (I wonder if they call them feasts still),
    giver of extra or special prizes, mostly sovs. and half-sovs., for foot races,
    etc.; leading spirit for the scrub district in electioneering campaigns&mdash;they
    went as right as men could go in the politics of those days who watched and
    went the way Jack Denver went; header of subscription lists for burnt-out,
    flooded-out, sick, hurt, dead or killed or otherwise knocked-out selectors
    and others, or their families; barracker and agitator for new provisional
    schools, assister of his Reverence and little bush chapels, friend of all
    manner of wanderers&mdash;careless, good-hearted scamps in trouble, broken-hearted
    new chums, wrecks and failures and outcasts of any colour or creed, and especially
    of old King Jimmy and the swiftly vanishing remnant of his tribe. His big
    slab-and-shingle and brick-floored kitchen, with its skillions, built on
    more generous plans and specifications than even the house itself, was the
    wanderer&rsquo;s goal and home in bad weather. And&mdash;yes, owner, on a
    small scale, of racehorses, and a keen sportsman.</p>
  <p>Jack Denver and Big Ben Duggan were boys together on the old selections,
    and at the new provisional bark school at Pipeclay; they went into the Great
    North-West together &ldquo;where all the rovers go&rdquo;&mdash;stock-riding
    and droving and over-landing, and came back after a few years bronzed and
    seasoned and with wild yarns.</p>
  <p>Jack married and settled down on a small run his father had bought near
    Talbragar, and his generous family of tall, straight bush boys and tall,
    straight bush girls grew up and had their sweethearts. But, when Jack married,
    Big Ben Duggan went back again, up into Queensland and the Great NorthWest,
    with a makeshift mate who had also lost his mate through marriage. Ever and
    again, after one, and two, and three years&mdash;the periods of absence lengthening
    as the years went on&mdash;Big Ben Duggan would come back home, and stay
    a while (till the Great North-West began to call insistently) at Denver&rsquo;s,
    where he would be welcomed jubilantly by all&mdash;even the baby who had
    never seen him&mdash;for there was &ldquo;something about the man.&rdquo; And,
    until late on the night of his return, he and Jack would sit by the fire
    in winter, or outside on the woodheap in summer, and yarn long and fondly
    about the Wide Places, and strange things they knew and understood.</p>
  <p>How sudden things are! Ben was back (just in time for the holidays and the
    Mudgee races) out of the level lands, where distance dwells in her halls
    of shimmering haze, after following her for five years.</p>
  <p>They were riding home from the races, the women and children in carts and
    buggies, the men and boys on horseback&mdash;of course. They raced each other
    along the road, across short cuts, through scrub and timber, and back to
    the slow-coming overloaded vehicles again, some riding wildly and recklessly.
    Jack Denver was amongst them, his heart warmed with good luck at the races,
    good whisky to wet it, and the return of his old mate. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
    as good as the best of the young &rsquo;uns yet, Ben!&rdquo; he cried, as
    they swung through the trees.  &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we, you old&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then and there it happened.</p>
  <p>A new chum suggested that Jack had more than he thought aboard and was thrown
    from his horse; but the new chum was repudiated with scorn and bad words
    and indignation by bushmen and bushwomen alike&mdash;as indeed he would be
    by any bushman who had seen a drunken rider ride.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I learnt him to ride when he was a kiddy about so high,&rdquo; said
    old Break-the-News Fosbery, resentfully gasping and gulping, &ldquo;and Jack
    wasn&rsquo;t thrown.&rdquo; It was thought at first that his horse had shied
    and run him against a tree, or under an overhanging branch; but Ben Duggan
    had seen it, and explained the thing to the doctor with that strange calmness
    or quietness that comes to men in the midst of a life&rsquo;s grief. Jack
    was riding loosely, and swung forward just as the filly, a fresh young thing,
    threw back her head; and it struck him with sledge-hammer force, full in
    the face.</p>
  <p>He was dead, even before they got him to Anderson&rsquo;s Halfway Inn. There
    was wild racing back to town for doctors, and some accidents; one horse was
    killed and another ridden to death. Others went as a forlorn hope in search
    of Doc. Wild, eccentric Yankee bush &ldquo;quack,&rdquo; who had once saved
    one of Denver&rsquo;s little girls from diphtheria; others, again, for Peter
    M&lsquo;Laughlan, bush missionary, to face the women&mdash;for they couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>Big Ben Duggan, blubbering unashamed by the bedside, put his hand on Mrs
    Denver&rsquo;s shoulder, as she crouched there, wildeyed, like a hunted thing.  &ldquo;Nev&mdash;never
    mind, Mrs Denver!&rdquo; he blurted out, with a note as of indignation and
    defiance&mdash;just for all the world as if Jack Denver had done a wrong
    thing and the district was down on him&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll have the
    longest funeral ever seen in these parts! Leave that to me.&rdquo; Then some
    of the women took her out to her daughter&rsquo;s. Big Ben Duggan gave terse
    instructions to some of the young riders about, and then, taking the best
    and freshest horse, the crosscountry scrub swallowed him&mdash;west. The
    young men jumped on their horses and rode, fan-like, east.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They took Jack Denver home. They always took their dead home first, whenever
    possible, and no matter the distance, before taking them to their last long
    home; and they do it yet, I suppose. They are not always so particular about
    it in cities, from what I&rsquo;ve seen.</p>
  <p>But this was a strange funeral. They had arranged mattress and sheet in
    the bottom of a four-wheeler, and covered him with sheet, blanket, and quilt,
    though the weather was warm; and over the body, from side to side of the
    trap, they had stretched the big dark-green table-cloth from Anderson&rsquo;s
    dining-room. The long, ghostly, white, cleared government road between the
    dark walls of timber in the moonlight. The buggies and carts behind, and
    the dead-white faces and glistening or despairingly staring eyes of the women&mdash;wife,
    daughters, and nieces, and those who had come to help and comfort. The men&mdash;sons
    and brothers, and few mates and chums and sweethearts&mdash;riding to right
    and left like a bodyguard, to comfort and be comforted who needed comfort.</p>
  <p>Now and again a brother or son&mdash;mostly a brother&mdash;riding close
    to the wheel, would suddenly throw out his arm on the mud splasher of buggy
    or cart, and, laying his head on it, sob as he rode, careless of tyre and
    spokes, till a woman pushed him off gently:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take care of the wheel, Jim&mdash;mind the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The eldest son held the most painful position, by his mother&rsquo;s side
    in the first buggy, supported by an aunt on the other side, while somebody
    led his horse. In the next buggy, between two daughters, sat a young fellow
    who was engaged to one of them&mdash;they were to be married after the holidays.
    The poor girls were white and worn out; he had an arm round each, and now
    and again they rested their heads on his shoulders. The younger girl would
    sleep by fits and starts, the sleep of exhaustion, and start up half laughing
    and happy, to be stricken wild-eyed the next moment by terrible reality.
    Some couldn&rsquo;t realize it at all&mdash;and to most of them all things
    were very dreamy, unreal and far away on that lonely, silent road in the
    moonlight&mdash;silent save for the slow, stumbling hoofs of tired horses,
    and the deliberate, half-hesitating clack-clack of wheel-boxes on the axles.</p>
  <p>Ben Duggan rode hard, as grief-stricken men ride&mdash;and walk. At Cooyal
    he woke up the solitary storekeeper and told him the news; then along that
    little-used old road for some miles both ways, and back again, rousing prospectors
    and fossickers, the butcher of the neighbourhood, clearers, fencers, and
    timber-getters, in hut and tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ben Duggan! Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead! Killed ridin&rsquo; home from
    the races! Funeral&rsquo;s to-morrow. Roll up at Talbragar or the nearest
    point you can get to on the government road. Tell the neighbours and folks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God! How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the hoofs of Ben&rsquo;s horse would be clattering or thudding away
    into the distance.</p>
  <p>He struck through to Dunne&rsquo;s selection&mdash;his brother-in-law, who
    had not been to the races; then to Ross&rsquo;s farm&mdash;Old Ross was against
    racing, but struck a match at once and said something to his auld wife about
    them black trousers that belonged to the black coat and vest.</p>
  <p>Then Ben swung to the left and round behind the spurs to the school at Old
    Pipeclay, where he told the schoolmaster. Then west again to Morris&rsquo;s
    and Schneider&rsquo;s lonely farms in the deep estuary of Long Gully, and
    through the gully to the Mudgee-Gulgong road at New Pipeclay. The long, dark,
    sullenly-brooding gully through which he had gone to school in the glorious
    bush sunshine with Jack Denver, and his sweetheart&mdash;now but three hours
    his hopelessly-stricken widow; Bertha Lambert, Ben&rsquo;s sweetheart&mdash;married
    now, and newly a grandmother; Harry Dale&mdash;drowned in the Lachlan; Lucy
    Brown&mdash;Harry&rsquo;s school-day and boy-and-girl sweetheart&mdash;dead;
    and&mdash;and all the rest of them. Far away, far away&mdash;and near away:
    up in Queensland and out on the wastes of the Never-Never. Riding and camping,
    hardship and comfort, monotony and adventure, drought, flood, blacks, and
    fire; sprees and&mdash;the rest of it. Long dry stretches on Dead Man&rsquo;s
    Track. Cutting across the country in No Man&rsquo;s Land where there were
    no tracks into the Unknown. Chancing it and damning it. Ill luck and good
    luck. Laughing at it afterwards and joking at it always; he and Jack&mdash;always
    he and Jack&mdash;till Jack got married. The children used to say Long Gully
    was haunted, and always hurried through it after sunset. It was haunted enough
    now all right.</p>
  <p>But, raising the gap at the head of the gully, he woke suddenly and came
    back from the hazy, lazy plains; the</p>
  <p class="note">Level lands where Distance hides in her halls of shimmering
    haze,<br>
    And where her toiling dreamers ride towards her all their days;</p>
  <p>where &ldquo;these things&rdquo; are ever far away, and Distance ever near&mdash;and
    whither he had drifted, the last hour, with Jack Denver, from the old Slab
    School.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder whether old Fosbery&rsquo;s got through yet?&rdquo; he muttered,
    with nervous anxiety, as he looked down on the cluster of farms and scattered
    fringe of selections in the broad moonlight. &ldquo;I wonder if he&rsquo;s
    got there yet?&rdquo;  Then, as if to reassure himself: &ldquo;He must have
    started an hour before me, and the old man can ride yet.&rdquo; He rode down
    towards a farm on Pipeclay Creek, about the centre of the cluster of farms,
    vineyards, and orchards.</p>
  <p>Old Fosbery&mdash;otherwise Break-the-News&mdash;was a character round there.
    If he was handy and no woman to be had, he was always sent to break the news
    to the wife of a digger or bushman who had met with an accident. He was old,
    and world-wise, and had great tact&mdash;also great experience in such matters.
    Bad news had been broken to him so many times that he had become hardened
    to it, and he had broken bad news so often that he had come to take a decided
    sort of pleasure in it&mdash;just as some bushmen are great at funerals and
    will often travel miles to advise, and organize, and comfort, and potter
    round a burying and are welcomed. They had broken the news to old Fosbery
    when his boy went wrong and was &ldquo;taken&rdquo; (&ldquo;when they took
    Jim&rdquo;). They had broken the news to old Fosbery when his daughter, Rose,
    went wrong, and bolted with Flash Jack Redmond. They had broken the news
    to the old man when young Ted was thrown from his horse and killed. They
    had broken the news to the old man when the unexpected child of his old age
    and hopes was accidentally burnt to death. So the old man knew how it felt.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The farm was the home of one of Jack Denver&rsquo;s married sisters, and,
    as there was no woman to go so far in the night, they had sent old Fosbery
    to tell her. Folks were most uneasy and anxious, by the way, when they saw
    old Fosbery coming unexpectedly, and sometimes some of them got a bad start&mdash;but
    it helped break the news.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, if he ain&rsquo;t there, I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to do it,&rdquo; thought
    Ben as he passed quietly through the upper sliprails and neared the house. &ldquo;The
    old man might have knocked up or got drunk after all. Anyway, no one might
    come in the morning till it&rsquo;s too late&mdash;it always happens that
    way&mdash;and&mdash;besides, the women&rsquo;ll want time to look up their
    black things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But, turning the corner of the cow-yard, he gave a sigh of relief as he
    saw old Fosbery&rsquo;s horse tied up. They were up, and the big kitchen
    lighted; he caught a glimpse of a shock of white hair and bushy white eyebrows
    that could have belonged to no one except old Break-the-News. They were sitting
    at the table, the tearful wife pouring out tea, and by the tokens Ben knew
    that old Fosbery had been very successful. He rode quietly to the lower sliprails,
    let them down softly, led his horse carefully over them, put them up cautiously,
    and stood in a main road again. He paused to think, leaning one arm on his
    saddle and tickling the nape of his neck with his little finger; his jaw
    dropped, reflecting and grief forgotten in the business on hand, and the
    horse  &ldquo;gave&rdquo; to him, thinking he was about to mount. He was
    tired&mdash;weary with that strange energetic weariness that cannot rest.
    It was five miles from Mudgee and the news was known there and must have
    spread a bit already; but the bulk of the Gulgong and Gulgong Road race-goers
    had passed here before the accident. Anyway, he thought he might as well
    go over and tell old Buckolts, of the big vineyard, across the creek, who
    was a great admirer of Jack Denver and had been drinking with him at the
    races that day. Old Buckolts was a man of weight in the district, and was
    always referred to by all from his old wife down, as &ldquo;der boss,&rdquo; and
    by no other term. The old slab farmhouse and skillions and out-houses, and
    the new square brick house built in front, were all asleep in the moonlight.
    The dogs woke the old man first (as was generally the case), as Ben opened
    the big white home gate and passed through without dismounting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s dat? Who voss die [there]?&rdquo; shouted the old man
    as the horse&rsquo;s hoofs crunched on the white creek-bed gravel between
    the two houses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ben Duggan!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vot voss der matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead&mdash;killed riding home from the races.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Vot dat you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben repeated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go avay! Go home and go to sleep! You voss shoking&mdash;and trunk.
    Vat for you gum by my house mit a seely cock mit der bull shtory at dis hour
    of der night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only too true, Mr Buckolts,&rdquo; said Ben. &ldquo;I
    wish to God it wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got der yoomps, Pen. Go to der poomp and poomp on your
    head and den turn in someveers till ter morning. I tells von of der pot&rsquo;s
    to gif you a nip and show you a poonk. Vy! I trink mit Shack Denver not twelf
    hour ago!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Ben persisted: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not drunk, Mr Buckolts, and I ain&rsquo;t
    got the horrors&mdash;I wish to God I was an&rsquo; had. Poor Jack was killed
    near Anderson&rsquo;s, riding home, about six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Though Ben couldn&rsquo;t see him, he could feel and hear by his tones,
    that old Buckolts sat up in bed suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Mein Gott!</i>&nbsp;How did it happen, Pen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ven and veer voss der funeral?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben told him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Frett! Shonny! Villie! Sharley!&rdquo; shouted the old man at the
    top of his voice to the boys sleeping in the old house. &ldquo;Get up and
    pring all der light horses in from der patticks, and gif dem a goot feet
    mit plenty corn; and get der double-parrelled puggy ant der sinkle puggy
    and der three spring carts retty. Dere vill pe peoples vanting lifts to-morrow.
    Ant get der harnesses and sattles retty. Vake up, olt vomans!&rdquo; (Mrs
    Buckolts must have been awake by this time.) &ldquo;Call der girls ant see
    to dere plack tresses. Py Gott, ve&nbsp;<i>moost</i>&nbsp;do dis thing in
    style. Does his poor sister know over dere across the creeks, Pen? Durn out!
    you lazy, goot-for-noddings, or I will chain you up on an ants&rsquo; bed
    mit a rope like a tog; do you not hear that Shack Denver voss dett?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vill sent some of der girls over dere first thing in der morning.
    Holt on, Pen, ant I vill sent you out some vine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben rode with the news to Lee&rsquo;s farm where Maurice Lee&mdash;at feud
    with Buckolts and a silent man&mdash;was, for he had known Denver all his
    life, and had gone, in his young days, on a long droving trip with him and
    Ben Duggan.</p>
  <p>A little later Ben returned to the main road on a fresh horse. He turned
    towards Gulgong, and rode hard, past the new bark provisional school and
    along the sidings. He left the news at Con O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s lonely
    tin grocery and sly-grog shop, perched on the hillside&mdash;(&ldquo;God
    forgive us all!&rdquo; said Con O&rsquo;Donnell). He left the news at the
    tumble-down public-house, among the huts and thistles and goats that were
    left of the Log Paddock Rush. There were goats on the veranda and the place
    seemed dead; but there were startled replies and inquiries and matches struck.
    He left the news at Newton&rsquo;s selection, and Old Bones Farm, and at
    Foley&rsquo;s at the foot of Lowe&rsquo;s Peak, close under the gap between
    Peak and Granite Ridge. Then he turned west, at right angles to the main
    road, and took a track that was deserted except for one farm and on every
    alternate Sunday. He passed the lonely little slab bush &ldquo;chapel&rdquo; of
    the locality, that broke startlingly out of the scrub by the track side as
    he reached it; and left the news at Southwick&rsquo;s farm at the end of
    the blind track. At more than one farm he left the bushwoman hurriedly looking
    up her  &ldquo;black things.&rdquo; and at more than one, one of the boys
    getting his bridle to catch his horse and ride elsewhere with the news.</p>
  <p>Ben rode back, through the moonlight and the moon-shadow haunted paddocks,
    and the naked, white, ringbarked trees, along Snakes Creek, parallel with
    the main road he had recently travelled till he struck Pipeclay Creek again
    lower down. He turned down the track towards the river, and at the junction
    left word at Lowe&rsquo;s&mdash;one of the old land-grant families. The dogs
    woke an old handy man (who had been &ldquo;sent out&rdquo; in past ages for &ldquo;knocking
    a donkey off a hen-roost&rdquo;&mdash;as most of them were) and Ben told
    him to tell the family.</p>
  <p>At Belinfante&rsquo;s Bridge across the Cudgegong Ben struck a big camp
    of bullock-drivers, some going down with wool and some going back for more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold on, Ben,&rdquo; cried Jimmy Nowlett, from his hammock under
    his wagon as Ben was riding off&mdash;&ldquo;Hold on a minute! I want to
    look at yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jimmy got his head out of his bunk very cautiously and carefully. and his
    body after it&mdash;there were nut ends of bolts, a heavy axle, and extremely
    hard projections, points, and corners within a very few short inches of his
    chaff-filled sugar-bag pillow. Slipping cannily on to his hands, and knees,
    he crawled out under the tail-board, dragging his &ldquo;moles&rdquo; after
    him, and stood outside in the moonlight shaking himself into his trousers.</p>
  <p>Jimmy was a little man who always wore a large size in moleskins&mdash;for
    some reason best known to himself&mdash;or more probably for no reason at
    all; or because of a habit he&rsquo;d got into accidentally years ago&mdash;or
    because of the motherly trousers his mother used to build for him when he
    was a boy. And he always shook himself into his pants after the manner of
    a woman shaking a pillow into a clean slip; his chin down on his chest and
    his jaw dropped, as if he&rsquo;d take himself in his teeth, after the manner
    of the woman with a pillow, were he not prevented by sound anatomical reasons.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You look reg&rsquo;lerly tuckered out, Ben,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; yer
    horse could do with a spell too. Git down, man, and have a pint er tea and
    a bite.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben got down wearily and knew at once how knocked up he was. He sat right
    down on the hard ground, embracing and drawing up his knees, and felt as
    if he&rsquo;d like never to get up again: while Jimmy shook some chaff and
    corn that he carried for his riding hack into a box for the horse, and his
    travelling mate, Billy Grimshaw, lifted his big namesake half full of cold
    tea, on to the glowing coals by the burning log-looking just like an orang-outang
    in a Crimean shirt.</p>
  <p>Ben got a fresh horse at Alfred Gentle&rsquo;s farm under the shadow of
    Granite Ridge, and then on to Canadian (th&rsquo; Canadian Lead of the roaring
    days), which had been saved from the usual fate by becoming a farming township.
    Here he roused and told the storekeeper. Then up the creek to Home Rule,
    dreariest of deserted diggings.</p>
  <p>He struck across the ages-haunted bush, and up Chinaman&rsquo;s Creek, past &ldquo;the
    Chinamen&rsquo;s Graves,&rdquo; and through the scrub and over the ridges
    for the Talbragar Road. For he had to see Jack Denver home from start to
    finish.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Glaring, hot and dusty, lay the long, white road; coated with dust that
    felt greasy to the touch and taste. The coffin was in a four-wheeled trap,
    for the solitary hearse that Mudgee boasted then was to meet them some three
    miles out of town&mdash;at the racecourse, as it happened, by one of those
    eternal ironies of fate. (Jones, the undertaker, had had another job that
    morning.) The long string of buggies and carts and horsemen; other buggies
    and carts and horsemen drawn respectfully back amongst the trees here and
    there along the route; male hats off and held rigidly vertical with right
    ears as the coffin passed; and drivers waiting for a chance to draw into
    the line.</p>
  <p>Think of it; up early on the first morning, a long day at the races, a long
    journey home, awake and up all night with grief and sympathy. Some of the
    men had ridden till daylight; the women, worn out and exhausted, had perhaps
    an hour or so of sleep towards morning&mdash;yet they were all there, except
    Ben Duggan, on the long, hot, dusty road back, heads swimming in the heat
    and faces and hands coated with perspiration and dust&mdash;and never, never
    once breaking out of a slow walk. It would have been the same had it been
    pouring with rain. I have seen funerals trotting fast in London, and they
    are trotting more and more in Australian cities, with only &ldquo;the time&rdquo; for
    an excuse. But in the bush I have never seen a funeral faster than the slowest
    of walks no matter who or what might wait, or what might happen or be lost.
    They stood by their dead well out there. Maybe some of the big, simple souls
    had a sort of vague idea that the departed would stand a better show if accompanied
    as far as possible by the greatest possible number of friends&mdash;&ldquo;barrackers,&rdquo; so
    to speak.</p>
  <p>Here all the shallow and involuntary sham of it, the shirking of a dull
    and irksome duty&mdash;a bore, though the route be only a mile or so. The
    satisfied undertaker, and the hard-up professional mutes and mourners in
    seedy, mouldy, greenyblack, and with boozers&rsquo; faces and noses and a
    constant craving for beer to help them bear up against their grief and keep
    their mock solemn faces. Out there you were carried to the hearse or trap
    from your home, and from the hearse or trap to your grave&mdash;and with
    infinite carefulness and gentleness&mdash;on the shoulders of men, and of
    men who had known and loved you.</p>
  <p>There had been wonder and waiting in the morning for Ben Duggan; and the
    women especially, on the way home, when free from restraint, were greatly
    indignant against him. To think that he should break out and go on the drunk
    on this day of all days, when his oldest mate and friend was being carried
    to his grave. The men, knowing how he had ridden all night, found great excuses;
    but later on some grew anxious and wondered what could have become of him.</p>
  <p>Some, returning home by a short cut, passed over Dead&rsquo; Man&rsquo;s
    Gap beyond Lowe&rsquo;s Peak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what could have become of Ben Duggan,&rdquo; mused one, as
    they rode down.</p>
  <p>There and then their wonders ceased.</p>
  <p>A party of road-clearers had been at work along the bottom, and there was
    much smoke from the burning-off, which must have made the track dim and vague
    and uncertain at night. Just at the foot of the gap, clear of the rough going,
    a newly-fallen tree lay across the track. It was stripped&mdash;had been
    stripped late the previous afternoon, in fact; and, well, you won&rsquo;t
    know what a log like that is when the sap is well up until you have stepped
    casually on to it to take a look round. A confident skip, with your boot
    soles well greased, on to the ice in a glaciarium for the first time would
    be nothing to it in its results, I fancy. (I remember we children used to
    scrape the sap off, and eat it with satisfaction, if not with relish&mdash;white
    box I think the trees were.)</p>
  <p>Ben must have broken into a canter as he reached the level, as indeed his
    horse&rsquo;s tracks showed he did, and the horse must have blundered in
    the smoke, or jumped too long or too short; anyway, his long slithering shoe
    marks were in the sap on the log, and he lay there with a broken leg and
    shoulder. He had struck it near the stump and the sharp edge of an outcrop
    of rock.</p>
  <p>There was more breakneck riding, and they got a cart and some bedding and
    carried Ben to Anderson&rsquo;s, which was handiest, if not nearest, and
    there was more wild and reckless riding for the doctor.</p>
  <p>One got a gun, and rode back to shoot the horse.</p>
  <p>Ben&rsquo;s case was hopeless from the first. He was hurt close to that
    big heart of his, as well as having a fractured skull. He talked a lot of
    the selections and old John Tierney, of the old bark school, and the Never-Never
    country with Jack&mdash;and, later on, of the present. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    Ben sayin&rsquo; now, Jim?&rdquo;  asked one young bushman as another came
    out of the room with an awestruck face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sayin&rsquo; that Jack Denver&rsquo;s dead, killed ridin&rsquo; home
    from the races, an&rsquo; that the funeral&rsquo;s to-morrow, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;re
    to roll up at Talbragar!&rdquo;  answered the other, with wide eyes, a blank
    face and in an awed voice. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s thinkin&rsquo; to-day&rsquo;s
    yisterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But towards the end, under the ministrations of the doctor, Ben became conscious.
    He rolled his head a little on the pillow after he woke, and then, seeming
    to remember all that happened up to his stunning fall, he asked quietly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What sort of a funeral did Jack have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They told him it was the biggest ever seen in the district.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Muster bin more &rsquo;n a mile long,&rdquo; said one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Watcher talkin&rsquo; about, Jim?&rdquo; put in another. &ldquo;Yer
    talkin&rsquo; through yer socks. It was more&rsquo;n a mile an&rsquo; a half,
    Ben, if it was er inch. Some of the chaps timed it an&rsquo; measured it
    an&rsquo; compared notes as well as they could. Why, the head was at the
    Racecourse when the tail was at Old&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Ben sank back satisfied and a little later took the track that Jack Denver
    had taken.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WantedbythePolice"></a>Wanted by the Police</b></h2>
  <p>Could&nbsp;it have been the Soul of Man and none higher that gave spoken
    and written word to the noblest precepts of human nature? For the deeper
    you sound it the more noble it seems, in spite of all the wrong, injustice,
    sin, sorrow, pain, religion, atheism, and cynics in the world. We make (or
    are supposed to make, or allow others to make) laws for the protection of
    society, or property, or religion, or what you will; and we pay thousands
    of men like ourselves to protect those laws and see them carried out; and
    we build and maintain expensive offices, police stations, court-houses and
    jails for the protecting and carrying out of those laws, and the punishing
    of men&mdash;like ourselves&mdash;who break them. Yet, in our heart of hearts
    we are antagonistic to most of the laws, and to the Law as a whole (which
    we regard as an ass), and to the police magistrates and the judges. And we
    hate lawyers and loathe spies, pimps, and informers of all descriptions and
    the hangman with all our soul. For the Soul of Man says: Thou shalt not refuse
    refuge to the outcast, and thou shalt not betray the wanderer.</p>
  <p>And those who do it we make outcast.</p>
  <p>So we form Prisoners&rsquo; Aid Societies, and Prisoners&rsquo; Defence
    Societies, and subscribe to them and praise them and love them and encourage
    them to protect or defend men from the very laws that we pay so dearly to
    maintain. And how many of us, in the case of a crime against property&mdash;and
    though the property be public and ours&mdash;would refuse tucker to the hunted
    man, and a night&rsquo;s shelter from the pouring rain and the scowling,
    haunting, threatening, and terrifying darkness? Or show the police in the
    morning the track the poor wretch had taken? I know I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
  <p>The Heart of Man says: Thou shalt not.</p>
  <p>At country railway stations, where the trains stop for refreshments, when
    a prisoner goes up or down in charge of a policeman, a native delicacy prevents
    the local loafers from seeming to notice him; but at the last moment there
    is always some hand to thrust in a clay pipe and cake of tobacco, and maybe
    a bag of sandwiches to the policeman.</p>
  <p>And, when a prisoner escapes, in the country at least&mdash;unless he be
    a criminal maniac in for a serious offence, and therefore a real danger to
    society&mdash;we all honestly hope that they won&rsquo;t catch him, and we
    don&rsquo;t hide it. And, if put in a corner, most of us would help them
    not to catch him.</p>
  <p>The thing came down through the ages and survived through the dark Middle
    Ages, as all good things come down through the ages and survive through the
    blackest ages. The hunted man in the tree, or cave, or hole, and strangers
    creeping to him with food in the darkness, and in fear and trembling; though
    he was, as often happened, an enemy to their creed, country, or party. For
    he was outcast, and hungry and a wanderer whom men sought to kill.</p>
  <p>These were mostly poor people or peasants; but it was so with the rich and
    well-to-do in the bloody Middle Ages. The Catholic country gentleman helping
    the Protestant refugee to escape disguised as a manservant (or a maidservant),
    and the Protestant country gentleman doing likewise by a hunted Catholic
    in his turn, as the battles went. Rebel helping royalist, and royalist helping
    rebel. And always, here and there, down through those ages, the delicate
    girl standing with her back to a door and her arms outstretched across it,
    and facing, with flashing eyes, the soldiers of the king or of the church&mdash;or
    entertaining and bluffing them with beautiful lies&mdash;to give some poor
    hunted devil time to hide or escape, though she a daughter of royalists and
    the church, and he a rebel to his king and a traitor to his creed. For they
    sought to kill him.</p>
  <p>There was sanctuary in those times, in the monkeries and the churches, where
    the soldiers of the king dared not go, for fear of God. There has been sanctuary
    since, in London and other places, where His or Her Majesty&rsquo;s police
    dared not go because of the fear of man. The &ldquo;Rocks&rdquo; was really
    sanctuary, even in my time&mdash;also Woollomooloo. Now the only sanctuary
    is the jail.</p>
  <p>And, not so far away, my masters! Down close to us in history, and in Merrie
    England, during Judge Jeffreys&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bloody Assize,&rdquo; which
    followed on the Monmouth rebellion and formed the blackest page in English
    history, &ldquo;a worthy widow named Elizabeth Gaunt was burned alive at
    Tyburn, for having sheltered a wretch who himself gave evidence against her.
    She settled the fuel about herself with her own hands, so that the flames
    should reach her quickly; and nobly said, with her last breath, that she
    had obeyed the sacred command of God, to give refuge to the outcast and not
    to betray the wanderer.&rdquo; (Charles Dickens&rsquo;s&nbsp;<i>History of
    England</i>.)</p>
  <p>Note, I am not speaking of rebel to rebel, or loyalist to loyalist, or comrade
    to comrade, or clansman to clansman in trouble&mdash;that goes without saying&mdash;but
    of&nbsp;<i>man and woman to man and woman in trouble</i>, the highest form
    of clannishness, the clannishness that embraces the whole of this wicked
    world&mdash;the Clan of Mankind!</p>
  <p>French people often helped English prisoners of war to escape to the coast
    and across the water, and English people did likewise by the French; and
    none dared raise the cry of &ldquo;traitors.&rdquo; It was the highest form
    of patriotism on both sides. And, by the way, it was, is, and shall always
    be the women who are first to pity and help the rebel refugee or the fallen
    enemy.</p>
  <p>Succour thine enemy.</p>

  <p>There must have been a lot of human kindness under the smothering, stifling
    cloud of the &ldquo;System&rdquo; and behind the iron clank and swishing &ldquo;cat&rdquo;  strokes
    of brutality&mdash;a lot of soul light in the darkness of our dark past&mdash;a
    page that has long since been closed down&mdash;when innocent men and women
    were transported to shame, misery, and horror; when mere boys were sent out
    on suspicion of stealing a hare from the squire&rsquo;s preserves, and mere
    girls on suspicion of lifting a ribband from the merchant&rsquo;s counter.
    But the many kindly and self-sacrificing and even noble things that free
    and honest settlers did, in those days of loneliness and hardship, for wretched
    runaway convicts and others, are closed down with the pages too. My old grandmother
    used to tell me tales, but&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t suppose a wanted man
    (or a man that wasn&rsquo;t wanted, for that matter) ever turned away from
    her huts, far back in the wild bush, without a quart of coffee and a &ldquo;feed&rdquo; inside
    his hunted carcass, or went short of a bit of bread and meat to see him on,
    and a gruff but friendly hint, maybe, from the old man himself. And they
    were a type of the early settlers, she an English lady and the daughter of
    a clergyman. Ah! well&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Do you ever seem to remember things that you could not possibly remember?
    Something that happened in your mother&rsquo;s life, maybe, if you are a
    girl, or your father&rsquo;s, if you are a boy&mdash;that happened&nbsp;<i>to</i>&nbsp;your
    mother or father some years, perhaps, before you were born. I have many such
    haunting memories&mdash;as of having once witnessed a murder, or an attempt
    at murder, for instance, and once seeing a tree fall on a man&mdash;and as
    a child I had a memory of having been a man myself once before. But here
    is one of the pictures.</p>
  <p>A hut in a dark gully; slab and stringy-bark, two rooms and a detached kitchen
    with the boys&rsquo; room roughly partitioned off it. Big clay fire-place
    with a big log fire in it. The settler, or selector, and his wife; another
    man who might have been &ldquo;uncle,&rdquo; and a younger woman who might
    have been &ldquo;aunt;&rdquo; two little boys and the baby. It was raining
    heavens hard outside, and the night was as black as pitch. The uncle was
    reading a report in a paper (that seemed to have come, somehow, a long way
    from somewhere) about two men who were wanted for sheep- and cattle-stealing
    in the district. I decidedly remember it was during the reign of the squatters
    in the nearer west. There came a great gust that shook the kitchen and caused
    the mother to take up the baby out of the rough gin-case cradle. The father
    took his pipe from his mouth and said: &ldquo;Ah, well! poor devils.&rdquo; &ldquo;I
    hope they&rsquo;re not out in a night like this, poor fellows,&rdquo; said
    the mother, rocking the child in her arms. &ldquo;And I hope they&rsquo;ll
    never catch &rsquo;em,&rdquo; snapped her sister. &ldquo;The squatters has
    enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wonder where poor Jim is?&rdquo; the mother moaned, rocking the
    baby, and with two of those great, silent tears starting from her haggard
    eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t start about Jim again, Ellen,&rdquo; said her sister
    impatiently. &ldquo;He can take care of himself. You were always rushing
    off to meet trouble half-way&mdash;time enough when they come, God knows.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Ellen,&rdquo; put in Uncle Abe, soothingly, &ldquo;he
    was up in Queensland doing well when we last heerd of him. Ain&rsquo;t yer
    never goin&rsquo; to be satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim was evidently another and a younger uncle, whose temperament from boyhood
    had given his family constant cause for anxiety.</p>
  <p>The father sat smoking, resting his elbow on his knee, bunching up his brush
    of red whiskers, and looking into the fire&mdash;and back into his own foreign
    past in his own foreign land perhaps: and, it may be, thinking in his own
    language.</p>
  <p>Silence and smoke for a while; then the mother suddenly straightened up
    and lifted a finger:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush! What&rsquo;s that? I thought I heard someone outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Poley coughin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe, after they&rsquo;d
    listened a space. &ldquo;She must be pretty bad&mdash;oughter give her a
    hot bran mash.&rdquo; (Poley was the best milker.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I fancied I heard horses at the sliprails,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old Prince,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe. &ldquo;Oughter let him into the
    shed. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the mother, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s someone outside.&rdquo; There
    was a step, as of someone retreating after peeping through a crack in the
    door, but it was not old Poley&rsquo;s step; then, from farther off, a cough
    that was like old Poley&rsquo;s cough, but had a rack in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See who it is, Peter,&rdquo; said the mother. Uncle Abe, who was
    dramatic and an ass, slipped the old double-barrelled muzzle-loader from
    its leathers on the wall and stood it in the far corner and sat down by it.
    The mother, who didn&rsquo;t seem to realize anything, frowned at him impatiently.
    The coughing fit started again. It was a man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there? Anyone outside there?&rdquo; said the settler
    in a loud voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Is the boss there? I want to speak to him,&rdquo;  replied
    a voice with no cough in it. The tone was reassuring, yet rather strained,
    as if there had been an accident&mdash;or it might be a cautious policeman
    or bushranger reconnoitring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better see what he wants, Peter,&rdquo; said his sister-in-law quietly.  &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
    the matter&mdash;it may be the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Peter threw an empty bag over his shoulders, took the peg from the door,
    opened it and stepped out. The racking fit of coughing burst forth again,
    nearer. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a church-yarder!&rdquo; commented Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>The settler came inside and whispered to the others, who started up, interested.
    The coughing started again outside. When the fit was over the mother said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute till I get the boys out of the road and then bring
    them in.&rdquo; The boys were bundled into the end room and told to go to
    bed at once. They knelt up on the rough bed of slabs and straw mattress,
    instead, and applied eyes and ears to the cracks in the partition.</p>
  <p>The mother called to the father, who had gone outside again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell them to come inside, Peter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better bring the horses into the yard first and put them under the
    shed,&rdquo; said the father to the unknown outside in the rain and darkness.
    Clatter of sliprails let down and tired hoofs over them, and sliprails put
    up again; then they came in.</p>
  <p>Wringing wet and apparently knocked up, a tall man with black curly hair
    and beard, black eyes and eyebrows that made his face seem the whiter; dressed
    in tweed coat, too small for him and short at the sleeves, strapped riding-pants,
    leggings, and lace-up boots, all sodden. The other a mere boy, beardless
    or clean shaven, figure and face of a native, but lacking in something; dressed
    like his mate like drovers or stockmen. Arms and legs of riders, both of
    them; cabbage-tree hats in left hands&mdash;as though the right ones had
    to be kept ready for something (and looking like it)&mdash;pistol butts probably.
    The young man had a racking cough that seemed to wrench and twist his frame
    as the settler steered him to a seat on a stool by the fire. (In the intervals
    of coughing he glared round like a watched and hunted sneak-thief&mdash;as
    if the cough was something serious against the law, and he must try to stop
    it.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take that wet coat off him at once, Peter,&rdquo; said the settler&rsquo;s
    wife, &ldquo;and let me dry it.&rdquo; Then, on second thoughts: &ldquo;Take
    this candle and take him into the house and get some dry things on him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dark man, who was still standing in the doorway, swung aside to let
    them pass as the settler steered the young man into the &ldquo;house;&rdquo; then
    swung back again. He stood, drooping rather, with one hand on the door-post;
    his big, wild, dark eyes kept glancing round and round the room and even
    at the ceiling, seeming to overlook or be unconscious of the faces after
    the first keen glance, but always coming back to rest on the door in the
    partition of the boys&rsquo; room opposite.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down by the fire and rest and dry yourself?&rdquo; asked
    the settler&rsquo;s wife, rather timidly, after watching him for a moment.</p>
  <p>He looked at the door again, abstractedly it seemed, or as if he had not
    heard her.</p>
  <p>Then Uncle Abe (who, by the way, was supposed to know more than he should
    have been supposed to know) spoke out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Set down, man! Set down and dry yerself. There&rsquo;s no-one there
    except the boys&mdash;that&rsquo;s the boys&rsquo; room. Would yer like to
    look through?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The man seemed to rouse himself from a reverie. He let his arm and hand
    fall from the doorpost to his side like dead things. &ldquo;Thank you, missus,&rdquo;  he
    said, apparently unconscious of Uncle Abe, and went and sat down in front
    of the fire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t you better take your wet coat off and let me dry it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; He took off his coat, and, turning the sleeves
    inside out, hung it from his knees with the lining to the fire; then he leaned
    forward, with his hands on his knees, and stared at the burning logs and
    steam. He was unarmed, or, if not, had left his pistols in the saddle-bag
    outside.</p>
  <p>Andy Page, general handy-man (who was there all the time, but has not been
    mentioned yet, because he didn&rsquo;t mention anything himself which seemed
    necessary to this dark picture), now remarked to the stranger, with a wooden-face
    expression but a soft heart, that the rain would be a good thing for the
    grass, mister, and make it grow; a safe remark to make under the present,
    or, for the matter of that, under any circumstances.</p>
  <p>The stranger said, &ldquo;Yes, it would.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It will make it spring up like anything,&rdquo; said Andy.</p>
  <p>The stranger admitted that it would.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abe joined in, or, rather, slid in, and they talked about the drought
    and the rain and the state of the country, in monosyllables mostly, with &ldquo;Jesso,&rdquo; and &ldquo;So
    it is,&rdquo; and &ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; till the settler
    came back with the young man dressed in rough and patched, but dry, clothes.
    He took another stool by his mate&rsquo;s side at the fire, and had another
    fit of coughing. When it was over, Uncle Abe remarked:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a regular church-yarder yer got, young feller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young fellow, too exhausted to speak, even had he intended doing so,
    turned his head in a quick, half-terrified way and gave it two short jerky
    nods.</p>
  <p>The settler had brought a bottle out&mdash;it was gin they kept for medicine.
    They gave him some hot, and he took it in his sudden, frightened, half-animal
    way, like a dog that was used to ill-usage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He ought to be in the hospital,&rdquo; said the mother.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He ought to be in bed right now at once,&rdquo; snapped the sister.  &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t
    you stay till morning, or at least till the rain clears up?&rdquo; she said
    to the elder man. &ldquo;No one ain&rsquo;t likely to come near this place
    in this weather.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If we did he&rsquo;d stand a good chance to get both hospital and
    a bed pretty soon, and for a long stretch, too,&rdquo; said the dark man
    grimly. &ldquo;No, thank you all the same, miss&mdash;and missus&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
    get him fixed up all right and safe before morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The father came into the end room with a couple of small feed boxes and
    both boys tumbled under the blankets. The father emptied some chaff, from
    a bag in the corner, into the boxes, and then dished some corn from another
    bag into the chaff and mixed it well with his hands. Then he went out with
    the boxes under his arms, and the boys got up again.</p>
  <p>The mother had brought two chairs from the front room (I remember the kind
    well: black painted hardwood that were always coming to pieces. and with
    apples painted on the backs). She stood them with their backs to the fire
    and, taking up the young man&rsquo;s wet clothes, which the settler had brought
    out under his arm and thrown on a stool, arranged them over the backs of
    chairs and the stool to dry. He lost some of his nervousness or scared manner
    under the influence of the gin, and answered one or two questions with reference
    to his complaint.</p>
  <p>The baby was in the cradle asleep. The sister drew boiling water from the
    old-fashioned fountain over one side of the fire and made coffee. The mother
    laid the coarse brownish cloth and set out the camp-oven bread, salt beef,
    tin plates, and pintpots. This was always called &ldquo;setting the table&rdquo; in
    the bush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better have it by the fire,&rdquo; said the bush-wife
    to the dark man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, missus,&rdquo; he said, as he moved to a bench by the
    table,  &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s plenty warm enough here. Come on, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack, under the influence of another tot, was in a fit state to sit down
    to a table something like a Christian, instead of coming to his food like
    a beaten dog.</p>
  <p>The hum of bush common-places went on. One of the boys fell across the bed
    and into deep slumber; the other watched on awhile, but must have dozed.</p>
  <p>When he was next aware, he saw, through the cracks, the taller man putting
    on his dried coat by the fire; then he went to a rough &ldquo;sofa&rdquo; at
    the side of the kitchen, where the young man was sleeping&mdash;with his
    head and shoulders curled in to the wall and his arm over his face, like
    a possum hiding from the light&mdash;and touched him on the shoulder.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Jack,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;wake up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jack sprang to his feet with a blundering rush, grappled with his mate,
    and made a break for the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Jack,&rdquo; said the other, gently yet firmly,
    holding and shaking him. &ldquo;Go in with the boss and get into your own
    clothes&mdash;we&rsquo;ve got to make a start.&rdquo; The other came to himself
    and went inside quietly with the settler. The dark man stretched himself,
    crossed the kitchen and looked down at the sleeping child; he returned to
    the fire without comment. The wildness had left his eyes. The bushwoman was
    busy putting some tucker in a sugar-bag.  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s tea and sugar
    and salt in these mustard tins, and they won&rsquo;t get wet,&rdquo;  she
    said, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s some butter too; but I don&rsquo;t know how
    you&rsquo;ll manage about the bread&mdash;I&rsquo;ve wrapped it up, but you&rsquo;ll
    have to keep it dry as well as you can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you, missus, but that&rsquo;ll be all right. I&rsquo;ve got
    a bit of oil-cloth,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>They spoke lamely for a while, against time; then the bushwoman touched
    the spring, and their voices became suddenly low and earnest as they drew
    together. The stranger spoke as at a funeral, but the funeral was his own.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about myself so much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for
    I&rsquo;m tired of it, and&mdash;and&mdash;for the matter of that I&rsquo;m
    tired of everything; but I&rsquo;d like to see poor Jack right, and I&rsquo;ll
    try to get clear myself, for his sake. You&rsquo;ve seen him. I can&rsquo;t
    blame myself, for I took him from a life that was worse than jail. You know
    how much worse than animals some brutes treat their children in the bush.
    And he was an &ldquo;adopted.&rdquo; You know what that means. He was idiotic
    with ill-treatment when I got hold of him. He&rsquo;s sensible enough when
    away with me, and true as steel. He&rsquo;s about the only living human thing
    I&rsquo;ve got to care for, or to care for me, and I want to win out of this
    hell for his sake.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paused, and they were all silent. He was measuring time, as his next
    words proved: &ldquo;Jack must be nearly ready now.&rdquo; Then he took a
    packet from some inside pocket of his blue dungaree shirt. It was wrapped
    in oil-cloth, and he opened it and laid it on the table; there was a small
    Bible and a packet of letters&mdash;and portraits, maybe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, missus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t think me soft,
    and I&rsquo;m neither a religious man nor a hypocrite. But that Bible was
    given to me by my mother, and her hand-writing is in it, so I couldn&rsquo;t
    chuck it away. Some of the letters are hers and some&mdash;someone else&rsquo;s.&nbsp;<i>You</i>&nbsp;can
    read them if you like. Now, I want you to take care of them for me and dry
    them if they are a little damp. If I get clear I&rsquo;ll send for them some
    day, and, if I don&rsquo;t&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t want them to be taken
    with me. I don&rsquo;t want the police to know who I was, and what I was,
    and who my relatives are and where they are. You wouldn&rsquo;t have known,
    if you&nbsp;<i>do</i>&nbsp;know now, only your husband knew me on the diggings,
    and happened to be in the court when I got off on that first cattle-stealing
    charge, and recognized me again to-night. I can&rsquo;t thank you enough,
    but I want you to remember that I&rsquo;ll never forget. Even if I&rsquo;m
    taken and have to serve my time I&rsquo;ll never forget it, and I&rsquo;ll
    live to prove it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we don&rsquo;t want no thanks, an&rsquo; we don&rsquo;t
    want no proofs,&rdquo; said the bushwoman, her voice breaking.</p>
  <p>The sister, her eyes suspiciously bright, took up the packet in her sharp,
    practical way, and put it in a work-box she had in the kitchen.</p>
  <p>The settler brought the young fellow out dressed in his own clothes. The
    elder shook hands quietly all round, or, rather, they shook hands with him. &ldquo;Now,
    Jack!&rdquo; he said. They had fastened an oilskin cape round Jack&rsquo;s
    shoulders.</p>
  <p>Jack came forward and shook hands with a nervous grip that he seemed to
    have trouble to take off. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t forget it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    all I can say&mdash;I won&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo; Then they went out with
    the settler. The rain had held up a little. Clatter of sliprails down and
    up, but the settler didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what Peter&rsquo;s doing?&rdquo; said the wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Showin&rsquo; &rsquo;em down the short cut,&rdquo; said Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>But, presently, clatter of sliprails down again, and cattle driven over
    them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wonder what he&rsquo;s doing with the cows,&rdquo; said the wife.</p>
  <p>They waited in wonder, and with growing anxiety, for some quarter of an
    hour; then Abe and Andy, going out to see, met the settler coming back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What in thunder are you doing with the cows, Peter?&rdquo; asked
    Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, just driving them out and along a bit over those horse tracks;
    we might get into trouble,&rdquo; said Peter.</p>
  <p>When the boys woke it was morning, and the mother stood by the bed. &ldquo;You
    needn&rsquo;t get up yet, and don&rsquo;t say anyone was here last night
    if you&rsquo;re asked,&rdquo; she whispered, and went out. They were up on
    their knees at once with their eyes to the cracks, and got the scare of their
    young lives. Three mounted troopers were steaming their legs at the fire&mdash;their
    bodies had been protected by oilskin capes. The mother was busy about the
    table and the sister changing the baby. Presently the two younger policemen
    sat down to bread and bacon and coffee, but their senior (the sergeant) stood
    with his back to the fire, with a pint-pot of coffee in his hand, eating
    nothing, but frowning suspiciously round the room.</p>
  <p>Said one of the young troopers to Aunt Annie, to break the lowering silence, &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t remember me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I do; you were at Brown&rsquo;s School at Old Pipeclay&mdash;but
    I was only there a few months.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You look as if you didn&rsquo;t get much sleep,&rdquo; said the senior-sergeant,
    bluntly, to the settler&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;and your sister too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so would you,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, sharply, &ldquo;if you
    were up with a sick baby all night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sad affair that, about Brown the schoolmaster,&rdquo; said the younger
    trooper to Aunt Annie.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;it was indeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The senior-sergeant stood glowering. Presently he said brutally&mdash;&ldquo;The
    baby don&rsquo;t seem to be very sick; what&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The young troopers move uneasily, and one impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You should have seen her&rdquo; (the baby) &ldquo;about twelve o&rsquo;clock
    last night,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;we never thought she would live
    till the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said the senior-sergeant, in a half-and-half
    tone.</p>
  <p>The mother took the baby and held it so that its face was hidden from the
    elder policeman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What became of Brown&rsquo;s family, miss?&rdquo; asked the young
    trooper.  &ldquo;Do you remember Lucy Brown?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Aunt Annie, &ldquo;all
    I know is that they went to Sydney. But I think I heard that Lucy was married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then Uncle Abe and Andy came in to breakfast. Andy sat down in the
    corner with a wooden face, and Uncle Abe, who was a tall man, took up a position
    with his back to the fire, by the side of the senior trooper, and seemed
    perfectly at home and at ease. He lifted up his coat behind, and his face
    was a study in bucolic unconsciousness. The settler passed through to the
    boys&rsquo; room (which was harness room, feed room, tool house, and several
    other things), and as he passed out with a shovel the sergeant said, &ldquo;So
    you haven&rsquo;t seen anyone along here for three days?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the settler.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except Jimmy Marshfield that took over Barker&rsquo;s selection in
    Long Gully,&rdquo; put in Aunt Annie. &ldquo;He was here yesterday. Do you
    want him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; them three fellers on horseback as rode past the corner
    of the lower paddock the day afore yesterday,&rdquo; mumbled Uncle Abe, &ldquo;but
    one of &rsquo;em was one of the Coxes&rsquo; boys, I think. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>At the sound of Uncle Abe&rsquo;s voice both women started and paled, and
    looked as if they&rsquo;d like to gag him, but he was safe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What were they like?&rdquo; asked the constable.</p>
  <p>The women paled again, but Uncle Abe described them. He had imagination,
    and was only slow where the truth was concerned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which way were they going?&rdquo; asked the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Towards Mudgee&rdquo; (the police-station township), said Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>The constable gave his arm an impatient jerk and dropped Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abe looked as if he wanted badly to wink hard at someone, but there
    was no friendly eye in the line of wink that would be safe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s strange,&rdquo; said the sergeant, &ldquo;that the
    men we&rsquo;re after didn&rsquo;t look up an out-of-the-way place like this
    for tucker, or horse-feed, or news, or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re neither
    cattle duffers nor sympathizers; we&rsquo;re honest, hard-working people,
    and God knows we&rsquo;re glad enough to see a strange face when it comes
    to this lonely hole; and if you only want to insult us you&rsquo;d better
    stop it at once. I tell you there&rsquo;s nobody been here but old Jimmy
    Marshfield for three days, and we haven&rsquo;t seen a stranger for over
    a fortnight, and that&rsquo;s enough. My sister&rsquo;s delicate and worried
    enough without you.&rdquo; She had a masculine habit of putting her hand
    up on something when holding forth, and as it happened it rested on the work-box
    on the shelf that contained the cattle-stealer&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s Bible;
    but if put to it, Aunt Annie would have sworn on the Bible itself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh well, no offence, no offence,&rdquo; said the constable. &ldquo;Come
    on, men, if you&rsquo;ve finished, it&rsquo;s no use wasting time round here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The two young troopers thanked the mother for their breakfast, and strange
    to say, the one who had spoken to her went up to Aunt Annie and shook hands
    warmly with her. Then they went out, and mounting, rode back in the direction
    of Mudgee.</p>
  <p>Uncle Abe winked long and hard and solemnly at Andy Page, and Andy winked
    back like a mechanical wooden image. The two women nudged and smiled and
    seemed quite girlish, not to say skittish, all the morning. Something had
    come to break the cruel hopeless monotony of their lives. And even the settler
    became foolishly cheerful.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>Five years later: same hut, same yard, and a not much wider clearing in
    the gully, and a little more fencing&mdash;the women rather more haggard
    and tired looking, the settler rather more horny-handed and silent, and Uncle
    Abe rather more philosophical. The men had had to go out and work on the
    stations. With the settler and his wife it was, &ldquo;If we only had a few
    pounds to get the farm cleared and fenced, and another good plough horse,
    and a few more cows.&rdquo; That had been the burden of their song for the
    five years and more.</p>
  <p>Then, one evening, the mail boy left a parcel. It was a small parcel, in
    cloth-paper, carefully tied and sealed. What could it be? It couldn&rsquo;t
    be the Christmas number of a weekly they subscribed to, for it never came
    like that. Aunt Annie cut the discussion short by cutting the string with
    a table knife and breaking the wax.</p>
  <p>And behold, a clean sugar-bag tightly folded and rolled.</p>
  <p>And inside a strong whitey-brown envelope.</p>
  <p>And on the envelope written or rather printed the words: &ldquo;For horse-feed,
    stabling, and supper.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And underneath, in smaller letters, &ldquo;Send Bible and portraits to  &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; (Here
    a name and address.)</p>
  <p>And inside the envelope a roll of notes. &ldquo;Count them,&rdquo; said
    Aunt Annie.</p>
  <p>But the settler&rsquo;s horny and knotty hands trembled too much, and so
    did his wife&rsquo;s withered ones; so Aunt Annie counted them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; mused the settler, scratching his head in a
    perplexed way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fifty pounds!&rdquo; gasped his wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Aunt Annie sharply, &ldquo;fifty pounds!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get it settled between yer some day!&rdquo; drawled
    Uncle Abe.</p>
  <p>Later, after thinking comfortably over the matter, he observed:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Cast yer coffee an&rsquo; bread an&rsquo; bacon upon the waters&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Uncle
    Abe never hurried himself or anybody else.</p>

  <p>The moral&nbsp;should be revived. Therefore, this is a story with a moral.
    The lower end of Bill Street&mdash;otherwise William&mdash;overlooks Blue&rsquo;s
    Point Road, with a vacant wedge-shaped allotment running down from a Scottish
    church between Bill Street the aforesaid and the road, and a terrace on the
    other side of the road. A cheap, mean-looking terrace of houses, flush with
    the pavement, each with two windows upstairs and a large one in the middle
    downstairs, with a slit on one side of it called a door&mdash;looking remarkably
    skully in ghastly dawns, afterglows, and rainy afternoons and evenings. The
    slits look as if the owners of the skulls got it there from an upward blow
    of a sharp tomahawk, from a shorter man&mdash;who was no friend of theirs&mdash;just
    about the time they died. The slits open occasionally, and mothers of the
    nation, mostly holding their garments together at neck or bosom, lean out&mdash;at
    right angles almost&mdash;and peer up and down the road, as if they are casually
    curious as to what is keeping the rent collector so late this morning. Then
    they shut up till late in the day, when a boy or two comes home from work.
    The terrace should be called &ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s Terrace&rdquo; if the road
    is not &ldquo;James&rsquo;s&rdquo; Road, because no bills ever seem to be
    paid there as they are in our street&mdash;and for other reasons. There are
    four houses, but seldom more than two of them occupied at one time&mdash;often
    only one. Tenants never shift in, or at least are never seen to, but they
    get there. The sign is a furtive candle light behind an old tablecloth, a
    skirt, or any rag of dark stuff tacked across the front bedroom window, upstairs,
    and a shadow suggestive of a woman making up a bed on the floor.</p>
  <p>If more than two of the houses are occupied there is almost certain to be
    an old granny with ragged grey hair, who folds her arms tight under her ragged
    old breasts, and bends her tough old body, and sticks her ragged grey old
    head out of the slit called a door, and squints up and down the road, but
    not in the interests of mischief-making&mdash;they are never here long enough&mdash;only
    out of mild, ragged, grey-headed curiosity regarding the health or affairs
    of the rent collector.</p>
  <p>Perhaps there are no bills to be collected in Skull Terrace because no credit
    is given. No jugs are put out, because there is no place to put them, except
    on the pavement, or on the narrow window ledges, where they would be in great
    and constant danger from the feet or elbows of passers-by. There are no tradesmen&rsquo;s
    entrances to the houses in Skull Terrace.</p>
  <p>Tenants and sub-tenants often leave on Friday morning in the full glare
    of the day. Granny throws down garments from the top window to hurry things,
    and the wife below ties up much in an old allegedly green or red table-cloth,
    on the pavement, at the last moment. Van of the &ldquo;bottle ho&rdquo;  variety.
    It is all done very quickly, and nobody takes any notice&mdash;they are never
    there long enough. Landlord, landlady, or rent collector&mdash;or whatever
    it is&mdash;calls later on; maybe, knocks in a tired, even bored, way; makes
    inquiries next door, and goes away, leaving the problem to take care of itself&mdash;all
    kind of casual. The business people of North Sydney, especially removers
    and labourers, are very casual. Down old Blue&rsquo;s Point Road the folk
    get so casual that they just exist, but don&rsquo;t seem to do so.</p>
  <p>One thing I never could make out about Skull Terrace is that when one house
    becomes vacant from a house agent&rsquo;s point of view&mdash;there is a
    permanent atmosphere of vacancy about the whole terrace&mdash;the people
    of another move into it. And there&rsquo;s not the slightest difference between
    the houses. It is because the removal is such a small affair, I suppose,
    and the change is the main thing. I always do better for awhile in a new
    house&mdash;but then I always did seem to get on better somewhere else.</p>
  <p>There are many points, or absence of points, about Skull Terrace that fit
    in with Jim&rsquo;s casualness as against Bill&rsquo;s character, therefore
    Blue&rsquo;s Point Road ought to be James&rsquo;s Street.</p>
  <p>But just now, in the heat of summer, the terrace happens to be full, and
    all the blinds are decent&mdash;the two new-comers are newly come down to
    Skull Terrace, and the other blinds are looked up, washed, and fixed up by
    force of example or from very shame&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>All of which seems to have nothing whatever to do with the story, except
    that the scene is down opposite my balcony as I think and smoke, and it is
    a blur on one of the most beautiful harbour views in the world.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>I had been working hard all day, mending the fence, putting up a fowl-house
    and some lattice work and wiry netting, and limewashing and painting. Labours
    of love. I&rsquo;d rather build a fowl-house than a &ldquo;pome&rdquo; or
    story, any day. And when finished&mdash;the fowl-house, I mean&mdash;I sit
    and contemplate my handiwork with pure and unadulterated joy. And I take
    a candle out several times, after dark, to look at it again. I never got
    such pleasure out of rhyme, story, or first-class London Academy notice.
    I find it difficult to drag myself from the fowl-house, or whatever it is,
    to meals, and harder to this work, and I lie awake planning next day&rsquo;s
    work until I fall asleep in the sleep of utter happy weariness. And I&rsquo;m
    up and at it, before washing, at daylight. But I was a carpenter and housepainter
    first.</p>
  <p>Well, it had been a long, close day, and I was very dirty and tired, but
    with the energy and restlessness of healthy, happy tiredness when work is
    unfinished. But I was out of two-inch nails, and the shops were shut.</p>
  <p>Then it struck me to start up the copper and have a real warm bath after
    my own heart and ideas. The bathroom is outside, next the wash-house and
    copper. There were plenty of splinters and ends of softwood that were mine
    by right of purchase and labour. My landlady is, and always has been, sensitive
    on the subject of firewood. She&rsquo;ll buy anything else to make the house
    comfortable and beautiful. She has been known to buy a piano for one of her
    nieces and burn rubbish in the stove the same day. I knew she was uneasy
    about the softwood odds and ends, but I couldn&rsquo;t help that&mdash;she&rsquo;d
    still be sentimental about them if she had a stack of firewood as big as
    the house. There&rsquo;s at least one thing that most folk hate to buy&mdash;mine&rsquo;s
    boot-laces or bone studs, so long as I can make pins or inked string do.</p>
  <p>I put a bucket of water in the copper, started a fire under that sent sparks
    out of the wash-house flue at an alarming rate, filled the copper to the
    brim, and, in the absence of a lid, covered it with a piece of flattened
    galvanized iron I had.</p>
  <p>I tacked the side edge of a strip of canvas to the matchboard wall along
    over the inner edge of the bath, fastened a short piece of gas-pipe to the
    outer edge, with pieces of string through holes made in it, and let it hang
    down over the bath, leaving a hole at the head for my head and shoulders.
    I was going to have a long, comfortable, and utterly lazy and drowsy hot
    water and steam bath, you know.</p>
  <p>I fastened a piece of clothes-line round and over the head of the bath,
    and twisted an old toilet-table cover and a towel round it where it sagged
    into the bath, for a head rest&mdash;also to be soaped for where I couldn&rsquo;t
    get at my back with my hands.</p>
  <p>I went up to my room for some things, and it struck me to arrange two chairs
    by the bed-candle and matches and tobacco on one side, and a pile of Jack
    London, Kipling, and Yankee magazines on the other, with the last&nbsp;<i>Lone
    Hand</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;on top.</p>
  <p>Going down with pyjamas, towel, and soap, it struck me to have a kettle
    and a saucepan full of water on the stove to use as the water from the copper
    cooled.</p>
  <p>I took a roomy, hard-bottomed kitchen chair into the bathroom; on it I placed
    a carefully scraped, cleared, and filled pipe, matches, more tobacco, tooth-brush,
    saucer with a lump of whiting and salt, piece of looking-glass&mdash;to see
    progress of the teeth&mdash;and knife for finger and toe nails. And I knocked
    up a few three-inch iron nails in the wall to hang things on. I placed a
    clean suit of pyjamas over the back of the chair, and over them the towels.</p>
  <p>I arranged with the landlady to have a good cup of coffee made, as she knows
    how to make it, ready to hand in round the edge of the door when I should
    be in the bath. There&rsquo;s nothing in that. I&rsquo;ve been with her for
    years, and on account of the canvas it would be just the same as if I were
    in bed. On second thought I asked her to hand in some toast&mdash;or bread
    and butter and bloater paste&mdash;at the same time. I fed the fire with
    judgment, and the copper boiled just as the last blaze died down. I got a
    pail and carried the water to the bath, pouring it in through the opening
    at the head. The last few pints I dipped into the pail with a cup. I covered
    the opening with a towel to keep the steam and heat in until I was ready.
    I got the boiling water from the kitchen into the bucket, covered it with
    another towel, and stood it in a handy corner in the bathroom.</p>
  <p>I made an opening, turned on the cold water, and commenced to undress. I
    hung my clothes on the wall, till morning, for I intended to go straight
    from the bath to bed in my pyjamas and to lie there reading.</p>
  <p>I turned off the cold water tap to be sure, lifted the towel off, and put
    my good right foot in to feel the temperature&mdash;into about three inches
    of cold water, and that was vanishing.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d forgotten to put in the plug.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;m deaf, you know, and the landlady, hearing the water run, thought
    I was flushing out the bath (we were new tenants) and wondered vaguely why
    I was so long at it.</p>
  <p>I dressed rather hurriedly in my working clothes, went inside, and spread
    myself dramatically on the old cane lounge and covered my face with my oldest
    hat, to show that it was come and I took it that way. But my landlady was
    so full of sympathy, condolence, and self-reproach (because she failed to
    draw my attention to the gurgling) that she let the coffee and toast burn.</p>
  <p>I went up and lay on my bed, and was so tired and misty and far away that
    I went to sleep without undressing, or even washing my face and hands.</p>
  <p>How many, in this life, forget the plug!</p>
  <p>And how many, ah! how many, who passed through, and are passing through
    Skull Terrace, commenced life as confidently, carefree, and clear headed,
    and with such easily exercised, careful, intelligent, practised, and methodical
    attention to details as I did the bath business arrangements&mdash;and forgot
    to put in the plug.</p>
  <p>And many because they were handicapped physically.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="InstinctGoneWrong"></a>Instinct Gone Wrong</b></h2>
  <p>Old Mac&nbsp;used to sleep in his wagon in fine weather, when he had no
    load, on his blankets spread out on the feed-bags; but one time he struck
    Croydon, flush from a lucky and good back trip, and looked in at the (say)
    Royal Hotel to wet his luck&mdash;as some men do with their sorrow&mdash;and
    he &ldquo;got there all right.&rdquo; Next morning he had breakfast in the
    dining-room, was waited on as a star boarder, and became thoroughly demoralized;
    and his mind was made up (independent of himself, as it were) to be a gentleman
    for once in his life. He went over to the store and bought the sloppiest
    suit of reach-me-downs of glossiest black, and the stiffest and stickiest
    white shirt they had to show&mdash;also four bone studs, two for the collar
    and two for the cuffs. Then he gave his worn &ldquo;larstins&rdquo; to the
    stable-boy (with half a crown) to clean, and&mdash;proceeded. He put the
    boots on during the day, one at a time between drinks, gassing all the time,
    and continued. He concluded about midnight, after a very noisy time and interviews
    with everyone on sight (slightly interrupted by drinks) concerning &ldquo;his
    room.&rdquo; It was show time, you see, and all the rooms were as full as
    he was&mdash;he was too full even to share the parlour or billiard room with
    others; but he consented at last to a shake-down on the balcony, the barmaid
    volunteering to spread the couch with her own fair hands.</p>
  <p>Towards daylight he woke, for one of the reasons why men do wake. It is
    well known, to people who know, that old campers-out (and young men new to
    it, too) will wake&nbsp;<i>once</i>&mdash;if in a party, each at different
    times&mdash;to tend to their cattle, or listen for the hobbles of their horses,
    or simply to rise on their elbows and have a look round&mdash;the last, I
    suppose, from an instinct born in old dangerous times. Mac woke up, and it
    was dark. He reached out and his hand fell, instinctively, on the rail of
    the balcony, which was to him (instinctively&mdash;and that shows how instinct
    errs) the rail of the side of his wagon, in which as I have said, he was
    wont to sleep. So he drew himself up on his knees and to his feet, with the
    instinctive intention of getting down to (say) put some chaff and corn in
    the feed-bags stretched across the shafts for the horses; for he intended,
    by instinct, to make an early start. Which shows how instinct can never be
    trusted to travel with memory, but will get ahead of it&mdash;or behind it.
    (Say it was instinct mixed with or adulterated by drink.) He got a long,
    hairy leg over and felt (instinctively) for the hub of the wheel; his foot
    found and rested on the projecting ledge of the balcony floor outside, and
    that, to him, was the hub all right. He swung his other leg over and expected
    to drop lightly on to the grass or dust of the camp; but, being instinctively
    rigid, he fell heavily some fifteen feet into a kerbed gutter.</p>
  <p>As a result of his howls lights soon flickered in windows and fanlights;
    and with prompt, eager, anxious, and awed bush first-aid and assistance,
    they carried a very sober, battered and blasphemous driver inside and spread
    mattresses on the floor. And, some six weeks afterwards, an image, mostly
    of plaster-of-Paris and bandages, reclined, much against its will, on a be-cushioned
    cane lounge on the hospital veranda; and, from the only free and workable
    corner of its mouth, when the pipe was removed, came shockingly expressed
    opinions of them &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; newfangled &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;!
    two-story &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;! &ldquo;night houses&rdquo;  (as it called
    them). And, thereafter, when he had a load on, or the weather was too bad
    for sleeping in or under his wagon, the veranda of a one-storied shanty (if
    he could get to it) was good enough for MacSomething, the carrier.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHypnotizedTownship"></a>The Hypnotized Township</b></h2>
  <p>They&nbsp;said that Harry Chatswood, the mail contractor would do anything
    for Cobb &amp; Co., even to stretching fencing-wire across the road in a
    likely place: but I don&rsquo;t believe that&mdash;Harry was too good-hearted
    to risk injuring innocent passengers, and he had a fellow feeling for drivers,
    being an old coach driver on rough out-back tracks himself. But he did rig
    up fencing-wire for old Mac, the carrier, one night, though not across the
    road. Harry, by the way, was a city-born bushman, who had been everything
    for some years. Anything from six-foot-six to six-foot-nine, fourteen stone,
    and a hard case. He is a very successful coach-builder now, for he knows
    the wood, the roads, and the weak parts in a coach.</p>
  <p>It was in the good seasons when competition was keen and men&rsquo;s hearts
    were hard&mdash;not as it is in times of drought, when there is no competition,
    and men&rsquo;s hearts are soft, and there is all kindness and goodwill between
    them. He had had much opposition in fighting Cobb &amp; Co., and his coaches
    had won through on the outer tracks. There was little malice in his composition,
    but when old Mac, the teamster, turned his teams over to his sons and started
    a light van for parcels and passengers from Cunnamulla&mdash;that place which
    always sounds to me suggestive of pumpkin pies&mdash;out in seeming opposition
    to Harry Chatswood, Harry was annoyed.</p>
  <p>Perhaps Mac only wished to end his days on the road with parcels that were
    light and easy to handle (not like loads of fencing wire) and passengers
    that were sociable; but he had been doing well with his teams, and, besides,
    Harry thought he was after the mail contract: so Harry was annoyed more than
    he was injured. Mac was mean with the money he had&mdash;not because of the
    money he had a chance of getting; and he mostly slept in his van, in all
    weathers, when away from home which was kept by his wife about half-way between
    the half-way house and the next &ldquo;township.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>One dark, gusty evening, Harry Chatswood&rsquo;s coach dragged, heavily
    though passengerless, into Cunnamulla, and, as he turned into the yard of
    the local &ldquo;Royal,&rdquo; he saw Mac&rsquo;s tilted four-wheeler (which
    he called his &ldquo;van&rdquo;) drawn up opposite by the kerbing round the
    post office. Mac always chose a central position&mdash;with a vague idea
    of advertisement perhaps. But the nearness to the P.O. reminded Harry of
    the mail contracts, and he knew that Mac had taken up a passenger or two
    and some parcels in front of him (Harry) on the trip in. And something told
    Harry that Mac was asleep inside his van. It was a windy night; with signs
    of rain, and the curtains were drawn close.</p>
  <p>Old Mac was there all right, and sleeping the sleep of a tired driver after
    a long drowsy day on a hard box-seat, with little or no back railing to it.
    But there was a lecture on, or an exhibition of hypnotism or mesmerism&mdash;&ldquo;a
    blanky spirit rappin&rsquo; fake,&rdquo; they called it, run by &ldquo;some
    blanker&rdquo;  in &ldquo;the hall;&rdquo; and when old Mac had seen to his
    horses, he thought he might as well drop in for half an hour and see what
    was going on. Being a Mac, he was, of course, theological, scientific, and
    argumentative. He saw some things which woke him up, challenged the performer
    to hypnotize him, was &ldquo;operated&rdquo; on or  &ldquo;fooled with&rdquo; a
    bit, had a &ldquo;numb sorter light-headed feelin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and was
    told by a voice from the back of the hall that his &ldquo;leg was being pulled,
    Mac,&rdquo; and by another buzzin&rsquo; far-away kind of &ldquo;ventrillick&rdquo; voice
    that he would make a good subject, and that, if he only had the will power
    and knew how (which he would learn from a book the professor had to sell
    for five shillings) he would be able to drive his van without horses or anything,
    save the pole sticking straight out in front. These weren&rsquo;t the professor&rsquo;s
    exact words&mdash; But, anyway, Mac came to himself with a sudden jerk, left
    with a great Scottish snort of disgust and the sound of heavy boots along
    the floor; and after a resentful whisky at the Royal, where they laughed
    at his scrooging bushy eyebrows, fierce black eyes and his deadly-in-earnest
    denunciation of all humbugs and imposters, he returned to the aforesaid van,
    let down the flaps, buttoned the daft and  &ldquo;feekle&rdquo; world out,
    and himself in, and then retired some more and slept, as I have said, rolled
    in his blankets and overcoats on a bed of cushions and chaff-bag.</p>
  <p>Harry Chatswood got down from his empty coach, and was helping the yard
    boy take out the horses, when his eye fell on the remnant of a roll of fencing
    wire standing by the stable wall in the light of the lantern. Then an idea
    struck him unexpectedly, and his mind became luminous. He unhooked the swinglebar,
    swung it up over his &ldquo;leader&rsquo;s&rdquo; rump (he was driving only
    three horses that trip), and hooked it on to the horns of the hames. Then
    he went inside (there was another light there) and brought out a bridle and
    an old pair of spurs that were hanging on the wall. He buckled on the spurs
    at the chopping block, slipped the winkers off the leader and the bridle
    on, and took up the fencing-wire, and started out the gate with the horse.
    The boy gaped after him once, and then hurried to put up the other two horses.
    He knew Harry Chatswood, and was in a hurry to see what he would be up to.</p>
  <p>There was a good crowd in town for the show, or the races, or a stock sale,
    or land ballot, or something; but most of them were tired, or at tea&mdash;or
    in the pubs&mdash;and the corners were deserted. Observe how fate makes time
    and things fit when she wants to do a good turn&mdash;or play a practical
    joke. Harry Chatswood, for instance, didn&rsquo;t know anything about the
    hypnotic business.</p>
  <p>It was the corners of the main street or road and the principal short cross
    street, and the van was opposite the pub stables in the main street. Harry
    crossed the streets diagonally to the opposite corner, in a line with the
    van. There he slipped the bar down over the horse&rsquo;s rump, and fastened
    one end of the wire on to the ring of it. Then he walked back to the van,
    carrying the wire and letting the coils go wide, and, as noiselessly as possible,
    made a loop in the loose end and slipped it over the hooks on the end of
    the pole. (&rdquo;Unnecessary detail!&rdquo; my contemporaries will moan, &ldquo;Overloaded
    with uninteresting details!&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s because they haven&rsquo;t
    got the details&mdash;and it&rsquo;s the details that go.) Then Harry skipped
    back to his horse, jumped on, gathered up the bridle reins, and used his
    spurs. There was a swish and a clang, a scrunch and a clock-clock and rattle
    of wheels, and a surprised human sound; then a bump and a shout&mdash;for
    there was no underground drainage, and the gutters belonged to the Stone
    Age. There was a swift clocking and rattle, more shouts, another bump, and
    a yell. And so on down the longish main street. The stable-boy, who had left
    the horses in his excitement, burst into the bar, shouting, &ldquo;The Hypnertism&rsquo;s
    on, the Mesmerism&rsquo;s on! Ole Mac&rsquo;s van&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo;  away
    with him without no horses all right!&rdquo; The crowd scuffled out into
    the street; there were some unfortunate horses hanging up of course at the
    panel by the pub trough, and the first to get to them jumped on and rode;
    the rest ran. The hall&mdash;where they were clearing the willing professor
    out in favour of a  &ldquo;darnce&rdquo;&mdash;and the other pubs decanted
    their contents, and chance souls skipped for the verandas of weather-board
    shanties out of which other souls popped to see the runaway. They saw a weird
    horseman, or rather, something like a camel (for Harry rode low, like Tod
    Sloan with his long back humped&mdash;for effect)&mdash;apparently fleeing
    for its life in a veil of dust, along the long white road, and some forty
    rods behind, an unaccountable tilted coach careered in its own separate cloud
    of dust. And from it came the shouts and yells. Men shouted and swore, women
    screamed for their children, and kids whimpered. Some of the men turned with
    an oath and stayed the panic with:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only one of them flamin&rsquo; motor-cars, you fools.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It might have been, and the yells the warning howls of a motorist who had
    burst or lost his honk-konk and his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s runnin&rsquo; away!&rdquo; or &ldquo;The toff&rsquo;s
    mad or drunk!&rdquo; shouted others.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll break its crimson
    back over the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let it!&rdquo; was the verdict of some. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the
    crimson carnal things are good for.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But the riders still rode and the footmen ran. There was a clatter of hoofs
    on the short white bridge looming ghostly ahead, and then, at a weird interval,
    the rattle and rumble of wheels, with no hoof-beats accompanying. The yells
    grew fainter. Harry&rsquo;s leader was a good horse, of the rather heavy
    coachhorse breed, with a little of the racing blood in her, but she was tired
    to start with, and only excitement and fright at the feel of the &ldquo;pull&rdquo; of
    the twisting wire kept her up to that speed; and now she was getting winded,
    so half a mile or so beyond the bridge Harry thought it had gone far enough,
    and he stopped and got down. The van ran on a bit, of course, and the loop
    of the wire slipped off the hooks of the pole. The wire recoiled itself roughly
    along the dust nearly to the heels of Harry&rsquo;s horse. Harry grabbed
    up as much of the wire as he could claw for, took the mare by the neck with
    the other hand, and vanished through the dense fringe of scrub off the road,
    till the wire caught and pulled him up; he stood still for a moment, in the
    black shadow on the edge of a little clearing, to listen. Then he fumbled
    with the wire until he got it untwisted, cast it off, and moved off silently
    with the mare across the soft rotten ground, and left her in a handy bush
    stockyard, to be brought back to the stables at a late hour that night&mdash;or
    rather an early hour next morning&mdash;by a jackeroo stable-boy who would
    have two half-crowns in his pocket and afterthought instructions to look
    out for that wire and hide it if possible.</p>
  <p>Then Harry Chatswood got back quickly, by a roundabout way, and walked into
    the bar of the Royal, through the back entrance from the stables, and stared,
    and wanted to know where all the chaps had gone to, and what the noise was
    about, and whose trap had run away, and if anybody was hurt.</p>
  <p>The growing crowd gathered round the van, silent and awestruck, and some
    of them threw off their hats, and lost them, in their anxiety to show respect
    for the dead, or render assistance to the hurt, as men do, round a bad accident
    in the bush. They got the old man out, and two of them helped him back along
    the road, with great solicitude, while some walked round the van, and swore
    beneath their breaths, or stared at it with open mouths, or examined it curiously,
    with their eyes only, and in breathless silence. They muttered, and agreed,
    in the pale moonlight now showing, that the sounds of the horses&rsquo; hoofs
    had only been &ldquo;spirit-rappin&rsquo; sounds;&rdquo; and, after some
    more muttering, two of the stoutest, with subdued oaths, laid hold of the
    pole and drew the van to the side of the road, where it would be out of the
    way of chance night traffic. But they stretched and rubbed their arms afterwards,
    and then, and on the way back, they swore to admiring acquaintances that
    they felt the &ldquo;blanky &rsquo;lectricity&rdquo;  runnin&rsquo; all up
    their arms and &ldquo;elbers&rdquo; while they were holding the pole, which,
    doubtless, they did&mdash;in imagination.</p>
  <p>They got old Mac back to the Royal, with sundry hasty whiskies on the way.
    He was badly shaken, both physically, mentally, and in his convictions, and,
    when he&rsquo;d pulled himself together, he had little to add to what they
    already knew. But he confessed that, when he got under his possum rug in
    the van, he couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of the professor and his creepy
    (it was  &ldquo;creepy,&rdquo; or &ldquo;uncanny,&rdquo; or &ldquo;awful,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rum&rdquo; with &rsquo;em
    now)&mdash;his blanky creepy hypnotism; and he (old Mac) had just laid on
    his back comfortable, and stretched his legs out straight, and his arms down
    straight by his sides, and drew long, slow breaths, and tried to fix his
    mind on nothing&mdash;as the professor had told him when he was &ldquo;operatin&rsquo; on
    him&rdquo; in the hall. Then he began to feel a strange sort of numbness
    coming over him, and his limbs went heavy as lead, and he seemed to be gettin&rsquo; light-headed.
    Then, all on a sudden, his arms seemed to begin to lift, and just when he
    was goin&rsquo; to pull &rsquo;em down the van started as they had heard
    and seen it. After a while he got on to his knees and managed to wrench a
    corner of the front curtain clear of the button and get his head out. And
    there was the van going helter-skelter, and feeling like Tam o&rsquo;Shanter&rsquo;s
    mare (the old man said), and he on her barebacked. And there was no horses,
    but a cloud of dust&mdash;or a spook&mdash;on ahead, and the bare pole steering
    straight for it, just as the professor had said it would be. The old man
    thought he was going to be taken clear across the Never-Never country and
    left to roast on a sandhill, hundreds of miles from anywhere, for his sins,
    and he said he was trying to think of a prayer or two all the time he was
    yelling. They handed him more whisky from the publican&rsquo;s own bottle.
    Hushed and cautious inquiries for the Professor (with a big P now) elicited
    the hushed and cautious fact that he had gone to bed. But old Mac caught
    the awesome name and glared round, so they hurriedly filled out another for
    him, from the boss&rsquo;s bottle. Then there was a slight commotion. The
    housemaid hurried scaredly in to the bar behind and whispered to the boss.
    She had been startled nearly out of her wits by the Professor suddenly appearing
    at his bedroom door and calling upon her to have a stiff nobbler of whisky
    hot sent up to his room. The jackeroo yard-boy, aforesaid, volunteered to
    take it up, and while he was gone there were hints of hysterics from the
    kitchen, and the boss whispered in his turn to the crowd over the bar. The
    jackeroo just handed the tray and glass in through the partly opened door,
    had a glimpse of pyjamas, and, after what seemed an interminable wait, he
    came tiptoeing into the bar amongst its awe-struck haunters with an air of
    great mystery, and no news whatever.</p>
  <p>They fixed old Mac on a shake-down in the Commercial Room, where he&rsquo;d
    have light and some overflow guests on the sofas for company. With a last
    whisky in the bar, and a stiff whisky by his side on the floor, he was understood
    to chuckle to the effect that he knew he was all right when he&rsquo;d won  &ldquo;the
    keystone o&rsquo; the brig.&rdquo; Though how a wooden bridge with a level
    plank floor could have a keystone I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;and they were
    too much impressed by the event of the evening to inquire. And so, with a
    few cases of hysterics to occupy the attention of the younger women, some
    whimpering of frightened children and comforting or chastened nagging by
    mothers, some unwonted prayers muttered secretly and forgettingly, and a
    good deal of subdued blasphemy, Cunnamulla sank to its troubled slumbers&mdash;some
    of the sleepers in the commercial and billiard-rooms and parlours at the
    Royal, to start up in a cold sweat, out of their beery and hypnotic nightmares,
    to find Harry Chatswood making elaborate and fearsome passes over them with
    his long, gaunt arms and hands, and a flaming red table-cloth tied round
    his neck.</p>
  <p>To be done with old Mac, for the present. He made one or two more trips,
    but always by daylight, taking care to pick up a swagman or a tramp when
    he had no passenger; but his &ldquo;conveections&rdquo; had had too much
    of a shaking, so he sold his turnout (privately and at a distance, for it
    was beginning to be called &ldquo;the haunted van&rdquo;) and returned to
    his teams&mdash;always keeping one of the lads with him for company. He reckoned
    it would take the devil&rsquo;s own hypnotism to move a load of fencing-wire,
    or pull a wool-team of bullocks out of a bog; and before he invoked the ungodly
    power, which he let them believe he could&mdash;he&rsquo;d stick there and
    starve till he and his bullocks died a &ldquo;natural&rdquo;  death. (He
    was a bit Irish&mdash;as all Scots are&mdash;back on one side.)</p>
  <p>But the strangest is to come. The Professor, next morning, proved uncomfortably
    unsociable, and though he could have done a roaring business that night&mdash;and
    for a week of nights after, for that matter&mdash;and though he was approached
    several times, he, for some mysterious reason known only to himself, flatly
    refused to give one more performance, and said he was leaving the town that
    day. He couldn&rsquo;t get a vehicle of any kind, for fear, love, or money,
    until Harry Chatswood, who took a day off, volunteered, for a stiff consideration,
    to borrow a buggy and drive him (the Professor) to the next town towards
    the then railway terminus, in which town the Professor&rsquo;s fame was not
    so awesome, and where he might get a lift to the railway. Harry ventured
    to remark to the Professor once or twice during the drive that &ldquo;there
    was a rum business with old Mac&rsquo;s van last night,&rdquo; but he could
    get nothing out of him, so gave it best, and finished the journey in contemplative
    silence.</p>
  <p>Now, the fact was that the Professor had been the most surprised and startled
    man in Cunnamulla that night; and he brooded over the thing till he came
    to the conclusion that hypnotism was a dangerous power to meddle with unless
    a man was physically and financially strong and carefree&mdash;which he wasn&rsquo;t.
    So he threw it up.</p>
  <p>He learnt the truth, some years later, from a brother of Harry Chatswood,
    in a Home or Retreat for Geniuses, where &ldquo;friends were paying,&rdquo; and
    his recovery was so sudden that it surprised and disappointed the doctor
    and his friend, the manager of the home. As it was, the Professor had some
    difficulty in getting out of it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheExciseman"></a>The Exciseman</b></h2>
  <p>Harry Chatswood, mail contractor (and several other things), was driving
    out from, say, Georgeville to Croydon, with mails, parcels, and only one
    passenger&mdash;a commercial traveller, who had shown himself unsociable,
    and close in several other ways. Nearly half-way to a place that was half-way
    between the halfway house and the town, Harry overhauled &ldquo;Old Jack,&rdquo; a
    local character (there are many well-known characters named &ldquo;Old Jack&rdquo;),
    and gave him a lift as a matter of course.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hello! Is that you, Jack?&rdquo; in the gathering dusk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then jump up here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harry was good-natured and would give anybody a lift if he could.</p>
  <p>Old Jack climbed up on the box-seat, between Harry and the traveller, who
    grew rather more stand- (or rather&nbsp;<i>sit</i>-) offish, wrapped himself
    closer in his overcoat, and buttoned his cloak of silence and general disgust
    to the chin button. Old Jack got his pipe to work and grunted, and chatted,
    and exchanged bush compliments with Harry comfortably. And so on to where
    they saw the light of a fire outside a hut ahead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let me down here, Harry,&rdquo; said Old Jack uneasily, &ldquo;I
    owe Mother Mac fourteen shillings for drinks, and I haven&rsquo;t got it
    on me, and I&rsquo;ve been on the spree back yonder, and she&rsquo;ll know
    it, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t want to face her. I&rsquo;ll cut across through
    the paddock and you can pick me up on the other side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Harry thought a moment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit still, Jack,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fix that all right.&rdquo; He
    twisted and went down into his trouser-pocket, the reins in one hand, and
    brought up a handful of silver. He held his hand down to the coach lamp,
    separated some of the silver from the rest by a sort of sleight of hand&mdash;or
    rather sleight of fingers&mdash;and handed the fourteen shillings over to
    Old Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here y&rsquo;are, Jack. Pay me some other time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks, Harry!&rdquo; grunted Old Jack, as he twisted for&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;pocket.</p>
  <p>It was a cold night, the hint of a possible shanty thawed the traveller
    a bit, and he relaxed with a couple of grunts about the weather and the road,
    which were received in a brotherly spirit. Harry&rsquo;s horses stopped of
    their own accord in front of the house, an old bark-and-slab whitewashed
    humpy of the early settlers&rsquo; farmhouse type, with a plank door in the
    middle, one bleary-lighted window on one side, and one forbiddingly blind
    one, as if death were there, on the other. It might have been. The door opened,
    letting out a flood of lamp-light and firelight which blindly showed the
    sides of the coach and the near pole horse and threw the coach lamps and
    the rest into the outer darkness of the opposing bush.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is that you, Harry?&rdquo; called a voice and tone like Mrs Warren&rsquo;s
    of the Profession.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A stoutly aggressive woman appeared. She was rather florid, and looked,
    moved and spoke as if she had been something in the city in other years,
    and had been dumped down in the bush to make money in mysterious ways; had
    married, mated&mdash;or got herself to be supposed to be married&mdash;for
    convenience, and continued to make money by mysterious means. Anyway, she
    was &ldquo;Mother Mac&rdquo;  to the bush, but, in the bank in the &ldquo;town,&rdquo; and
    in the stores where she dealt, she was Mrs Mac, and there was always a promptly
    propped chair for her. She was, indeed, the missus of no other than old Mac,
    the teamster of hypnotic fame, and late opposition to Harry Chatswood. Hence,
    perhaps, part of Harry&rsquo;s hesitation to pull up, farther back, and his
    generosity to Old Jack.</p>
  <p>Mrs or Mother Mac sold refreshments, from a rough bush dinner at eighteenpence
    a head to passengers, to a fly-blown bottle of ginger-ale or lemonade, hot
    in hot weather from a sunny fly-specked window. In between there was cold
    corned beef, bread and butter, and tea, and (best of all if they only knew
    it) a good bush billy of coffee on the coals before the fire on cold wet
    nights. And outside of it all, there was cold tea, which, when confidence
    was established, or they knew one of the party, she served hushedly in cups
    without saucers; for which she sometimes apologized, and which she took into
    her murderous bedroom to fill, and replenish, in its darkest and most felonious
    corner from homicidal-looking pots, by candle-light. You&rsquo;d think you
    were in a cheap place, where you shouldn&rsquo;t be, in the city.</p>
  <p>Harry and his passengers got down and stretched their legs, and while Old
    Jack was guardedly answering a hurriedly whispered inquiry of the traveller,
    Harry took the opportunity to nudge Mrs Mac, and whisper in her ear</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look out, Mrs Mac!&mdash;Exciseman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The devil he is!&rdquo; whispered she.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-e-es!&rdquo; whispered Harry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Harry!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Never a word! I&rsquo;ll
    take care of him, bless his soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After a warm at the wide wood fire, a gulp of coffee and a bite or two at
    the bread and meat, the traveller, now thoroughly thawed, stretched himself
    and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, Mrs Mac, haven&rsquo;t you got anything else to offer us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what more would you be wanting?&rdquo; she snapped. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t
    the bread and meat good enough for you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he suggested lamely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Know?&mdash;I know!&mdash;What do&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;know?&rdquo; A
    pause, then, with startling suddenness, &ldquo;Phwat d&rsquo;y&rsquo; mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No offence, Mrs Mac&mdash;no offence; but haven&rsquo;t you got something
    in the way of&mdash;of a drink to offer us?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dhrink! Isn&rsquo;t the coffee good enough for ye? I paid two and
    six a pound for ut, and the milk new from the cow this very evenin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; th&rsquo; water
    rain-water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;you know what I mean, Mrs Mac.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I&nbsp;<i>doan&rsquo;</i>t know what ye mean.&nbsp;<i>Phwat
      do ye mean?</i>&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve asked ye that before. What are ye dhrivin&rsquo; at,
      man&mdash;out with it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I mean a little drop of the right stuff,&rdquo; he said, nettled.
    Then he added: &ldquo;No offence&mdash;no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O-o-oh!&rdquo; she said, illumination bursting in upon her brain. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
    the dirrty drink ye&rsquo;re afther, is it? Well, I&rsquo;ll tell ye, first
    for last, that we doan&rsquo;t keep a little drop of the right stuff nor
    a little drop of the wrong stuff in this house. It&rsquo;s a honest house,
    an&rsquo; me husband&rsquo;s a honest harrd-worrkin&rsquo; carrier, as he&rsquo;d
    soon let ye know if he was at home this cold night, poor man. No dirrty drink
    comes into this house, nor goes out of it, I&rsquo;d have ye know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, now, Mrs Mac, between friends, I meant no offence; but it&rsquo;s
    a cold night, and I thought you might keep a bottle for medicine or in case
    of accident&mdash;or snake-bite, you know&mdash;they mostly do in the bush.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Medicine! And phwat should we want with medicine? This isn&rsquo;t
    a five-guinea private hospital. We&rsquo;re clean, healthy people, I&rsquo;d
    have ye know. There&rsquo;s a bottle of painkiller, if that&rsquo;s what
    ye want, and a packet of salts left&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;d do ye some good.
    An&rsquo; a bottle of eye-water, an&rsquo; something to put in your ear for
    th&rsquo; earache&mdash;maybe ye&rsquo;ll want &rsquo;em both before ye go
    much farther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But, Mrs Mac&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no more of it!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I tell ye that if it&rsquo;s
    a nip ye&rsquo;re afther, t&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll have to go on fourteen miles
    to the pub in the town. Ye&rsquo;re coffee&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo; cowld, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
    eighteenpence each to passengers I charge on a night like this; Harry Chatswood&rsquo;s
    the driver an&rsquo; welcome, an&rsquo; Ould Jack&rsquo;s an ould friend.&rdquo; And
    she flounced round to clatter her feelings amongst the crockery on the dresser&mdash;just
    as men make a great show of filling and lighting their pipes in the middle
    of a barney. The table, by the way, was set on a brown holland cloth, with
    the brightest of tin plates for cold meals, and the brightest of tin pint-pots
    for the coffee (the crockery was in reserve for hot meals and special local
    occasions) and at one side of the wide fire-place hung an old-fashioned fountain,
    while in the other stood a camp-oven; and billies and a black kerosene-tin
    hung evermore over the fire from sooty chains. These, and a big bucket-handled
    frying-pan and a few rusty convict-time arms on the slab walls, were mostly
    to amuse jackeroos and jackerooesses, and let them think they were getting
    into the Australian-dontcherknow at last.</p>
  <p>Harry Chatswood took the opportunity (he had a habit of taking opportunities
    of this sort) to whisper to Old Jack:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pay her the fourteen bob, Jack, and have done with it. She&rsquo;s
    got the needle to-night all right, and damfiknow what for. But the sight
    of your fourteen bob might bring her round.&rdquo; And Old Jack&mdash;as
    was his way&mdash;blundered obediently and promptly right into the hole that
    was shown him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs Mac,&rdquo; he said, getting up from the table and slipping
    his hand into his pocket. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s come over
    yer to-night, but, anyway&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here he put the money down
    on the table. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the money I owe yer for&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For what?&rdquo; she demanded, turning on him with surprising swiftness
    for such a stout woman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The&mdash;the fourteen bob I owed for them drinks when Bill Hogan
    and me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t owe me no fourteen bob for dhrinks, you dirty blaggard!
    Are ye mad? You got no drink off of me. Phwat d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Beg&mdash;beg pardin, Mrs Mac,&rdquo; stammered Old Jack, very much
    taken aback; &ldquo;but the&mdash;yer know&mdash;the fourteen bob, anyway,
    I owed you when&mdash;that night when me an&rsquo; Bill Hogan an&rsquo; yer
    sister-in-law, Mary Don&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What? Well, I&mdash;Git out of me house, ye low blaggard! I&rsquo;m
    a honest, respictable married woman, and so is me sister-in-law, Mary Donelly;
    and to think!&mdash;Git out of me door!&rdquo; and she caught up the billy
    of coffee. &ldquo;Git outside me door, or I&rsquo;ll let ye have it in ye&rsquo;r
    ugly face, ye low woolscourer&mdash;an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s nearly bilin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Jack stumbled dazedly out, and blind instinct got him on to the coach
    as the safest place. Harry Chatswood had stood with his long, gaunt figure
    hung by an elbow to the high mantelshelf, all the time, taking alternate
    gulps from his pint of coffee and puffs from his pipe, and very calmly and
    restfully regarding the scene.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if the&nbsp;<i>gentleman&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;done,
    I&rsquo;d thank him to pay&mdash;it&rsquo;s eighteenpence&mdash;an&rsquo; git
    his overcoat on. I&rsquo;ve had enough dirty insults this night to last me
    a lifetime. To think of it&mdash;the blaggard!&rdquo; she said to the table, &ldquo;an&rsquo; me
    a woman alone in a place like this on a night like this!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The traveller calmly put down a two-shilling piece, as if the whole affair
    was the most ordinary thing in the world (for he was used to many bush things)
    and comfortably got into his overcoat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs Mac, I never thought Old Jack was mad before,&rdquo; said
    Harry Chatswood. &ldquo;And I hinted to him,&rdquo; he added in a whisper. &ldquo;Anyway&rdquo; (out
    loudly), &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll lend me a light, Mrs Mac, to have a look at
    that there swingle-bar of mine?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With pleasure, Harry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for you&rsquo;re a
    white man, anyway. I&rsquo;ll bring ye a light. An&rsquo; all the lights
    in heaven if I could, an&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; in the other place if they&rsquo;d
    help ye.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When he&rsquo;d looked to the swingle-bar, and had mounted to his place
    and untwisted the reins from a side-bar, she cried:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; as for them two, Harry, shpill them in the first creek
    you come to, an&rsquo; God be good to you! It&rsquo;s all they&rsquo;re fit
    for, the low blaggards, to insult an honest woman alone in the bush in a
    place like this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, Mrs Mac,&rdquo; said Harry, cheerfully. &ldquo;Good night,
    Mrs Mac.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Harry, an&rsquo; God go with ye, for the creeks are risen
    after last night&rsquo;s storm.&rdquo; And Harry drove on and left her to
    think over it.</p>
  <p>She thought over it in a way that would have been unexpected to Harry, and
    would have made him uneasy, for he was really good-natured. She sat down
    on a stool by the fire, and presently, after thinking over it a bit, two
    big, lonely tears rolled down the lonely woman&rsquo;s fair, fat, blonde
    cheeks in the firelight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; to think of Old Jack,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The very
    last man in the world I&rsquo;d dreamed of turning on me. But&mdash;but I
    always thought Old Jack was goin&rsquo;  a bit ratty, an&rsquo; maybe I was
    a bit hard on him. God forgive us all!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Had Harry Chatswood seen her then he would have been sorry he did it. Swagmen
    and broken-hearted new chums had met worse women than Mother Mac.</p>
  <p>But she pulled herself together, got up and bustled round. She put on more
    wood, swept the hearth, put a parcel of fresh steak and sausages&mdash;brought
    by the coach&mdash;on to a clean plate on the table, and got some potatoes
    into a dish; for Chatswood had told her that her first and longest and favourite
    stepson was not far behind him with the bullock team. Before she had finished
    the potatoes she heard the clock-clock of heavy wheels and the crack of the
    bullock whip coming along the dark bush track.</p>
  <p>But the very next morning a man riding back from Croydon called, and stuck
    his head under the veranda eaves with a bush greeting, and she told him all
    about it.</p>
  <p>He straightened up, and tickled the back of his head with his little finger,
    and gaped at her for a minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t no excise officer.
    I know him well&mdash;I was drinking with him at the Royal last night afore
    we went to bed, an&rsquo; had a nip with him this morning afore we started.
    Why! that&rsquo;s Bobby Howell, Burns and Bridges&rsquo; traveller, an&rsquo; a
    good sort when he wakes up, an&rsquo; willin&rsquo; with the money when he
    does good biz, especially when there&rsquo;s a chanst of a drink on a long
    road on a dark night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That Harry Chatswood again! The infernal villain,&rdquo; she cried,
    with a jerk of her arm. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll be even with him, the dirrty
    blaggard. An&rsquo; to think&mdash;I always knew Old Jack was a white man
    an&rsquo;&mdash;to think! There&rsquo;s fourteen shillin&rsquo;s gone that

  <p>How&nbsp;we do misquote sayings, or misunderstand them when quoted rightly!
    For instance, we &ldquo;wait for something to turn up, like Micawber,&rdquo;  careless
    or ignorant of the fact that Micawber worked harder than all the rest put
    together for the leading characters&rsquo; sakes; he was the chief or only
    instrument in straightening out of the sadly mixed state of things&mdash;and
    he held his tongue till the time came. Moreover&mdash;and &ldquo;<i>Put a
    pin in that spot</i>, young man,&rdquo; as Dr &ldquo;Yark&rdquo; used to
    say&mdash;when there came a turn in the tide of the affairs of Micawber,
    he took it at the flood, and it led on to fortune. He became a hardworking
    settler, a pioneer&mdash;a respected early citizen and magistrate in this
    bright young Commonwealth of ours, my masters!</p>
  <p>And, by the way, and strictly between you and me, I have a shrewd suspicion
    that Uriah Heep wasn&rsquo;t the only cad in David Copperfield.</p>
  <p>Brutus, the originator of the saying, took the tide at the flood, and it
    led him and his friends on to death, or&mdash;well, perhaps, under the circumstances,
    it was all the same to Brutus and his old mate, Cassius.</p>
  <p class="note">And this, my masters, brings me home,<br>
    A Bush-born bard, to Ancient Rome.</p>
  <p>And there&rsquo;s little difference in the climate, or the men&mdash;save
    in the little matter of ironmongery&mdash;and no difference at all in the
    women.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ll pass over the accident that happened to Caesar. Such accidents
    had happened to great and little Caesars hundreds of times before, and have
    happened many times since, and will happen until the end of time, both in &ldquo;sport&rdquo; (in
    plays) and in earnest:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    . . . . How many ages hence<br>
    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over<br>
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,<br>
    That now at Pompey&rsquo;s basis lies along<br>
    No worthier than the dust!</p>
  <p>Shakespeare hadn&rsquo;t Australia and George Rignold in his mind&rsquo;s
    eye when he wrote that.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    So oft as that shall be,<br>
    So often shall the knot of us be call&rsquo;d<br>
    The men that gave their country liberty.</p>
  <p>Well, be that as it will, I&rsquo;m with Brutus too, irrespective of the
    merits of the case. Antony spoke at the funeral, with free and generous permission,
    and see what he made of it. And why shouldn&rsquo;t I? and see what I&rsquo;ll
    make of it.</p>
  <p>Antony, after sending abject and uncalled&mdash;for surrender, and grovelling
    unasked in the dust to Brutus and his friends as no straight mate should
    do for another, dead or alive&mdash;and after taking the blood-stained hands
    of his alleged friend&rsquo;s murderers&mdash;got permission to speak. To
    speak for his own ends or that paltry, selfish thing called &ldquo;revenge,&rdquo; be
    it for one&rsquo;s self or one&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Brutus, I want a word with you,&rdquo; whispered Cassius. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
    let him speak! You don&rsquo;t know how he might stir up the mob with what
    he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Brutus had already given his word:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Antony</i>:<br>
    That&rsquo;s all I seek:<br>
    And am moreover suitor that I may<br>
    Produce his body to the market place,<br>
    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,<br>
    Speak in the order of his funeral.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    You shall, Mark Antony.</p>
  <p>And now, strong in his right, as he thinks, and trusting to the honour of
    Antony, he only stipulates that he (Brutus) shall go on to the platform first
    and explain things; and that Antony shall speak all the good he can of Caesar,
    but not abuse Brutus and his friends.</p>
  <p>And Antony (mark you) agrees and promises and breaks his promise immediately
    afterwards. Maybe he was only gaining time for his good friend Octavius Caesar,
    but time gained by such foul means is time lost through all eternity. Did
    Mark think of these things years afterwards in Egypt when he was doubly ruined
    and doubly betrayed to his good friend Octavius by that hot, jealous, selfish,
    shallow, shifty, strumpet, Cleopatra, and Octavius was after his scalp with
    a certainty of getting it? He did&mdash;and he spoke of it, too.</p>
  <p>Brutus made his speech, a straightforward, manly speech in prose, and the
    gist of the matter was that he did what he did (killed Caesar), not because
    he loved Caesar less, but because he loved Rome more. And I believe he told
    the simple honest truth.</p>
  <p>Then he acts as Antony&rsquo;s chairman, or introducer, in a manly straightforward
    manner, and then he goes off and leaves the stage to him, which is another
    generous act; though it was lucky for Brutus, as it happened afterwards,
    that he was out of the way.</p>
  <p>Mark Antony gets all the limelight and blank verse. He had the  &ldquo;gift
    of the gab&rdquo; all right. Old Cassius referred to it later on in one of
    those &ldquo;words-before-blows&rdquo; barneys they had on the battlefield
    where they hurt each other a damned sight more with their tongues than they
    did with their swords afterwards.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ve all heard of Antony&rsquo;s speech</p>
  <p class="note">I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</p>
  <p>Which was a lie to start with.</p>
  <p class="note">The evil that men do lives after them,<br>
    The good is oft interred with their bones.</p>
  <p>Which is not so true in these days of newspapers and magazines. And so on.
    He says that Brutus and his friends are honourable men about nine times in
    his short speech. Now, was Mark Antony an honourable man?</p>
  <p>And then the flap-doodle about dead Caesar&rsquo;s wounds, and their poor
    dumb mouths, and the people kissing them, and dipping their handkerchiefs
    in his sacred blood. All worthy of our Purves trying to pump tears out of
    a jury.</p>
  <p>But it fetched the crowd; it always did, it always has done, it always does,
    and it always will do. And the hint of Caesar&rsquo;s will, and the open
    abuse of Brutus and Co. when he saw that he was safe, and the cheap anti-climax
    of the reading of the will. Nothing in this line can be too cheap for the
    crowd, as witness the melodramas of our own civilized and enlightened times.</p>
  <p>Antony was a noble Purves.</p>
  <p>And the mob rushed off to burn houses, as it has always done, and will always
    do when it gets a chance&mdash;it tried to burn mine more than once.</p>
  <p>The quarrel scene between Brutus and Cassius is one of the best scenes in
    Shakespeare. It is great from the sublime to the ridiculous&mdash;you must
    read it for yourself. It seems that Brutus objected to Cassius&rsquo;s, or
    one of his off-side friends&rsquo; methods of raising the wind&mdash;he reckoned
    it was one of the very things they killed Julius Caesar for; and Cassius,
    loving Brutus more than a brother, is very much hurt about it. I can&rsquo;t
    make out what the trouble really was about and I don&rsquo;t suppose either
    Cassius or Brutus was clear as to what it was all about either. It&rsquo;s
    generally the way when friends fall out. It seems also that Brutus thinks
    that Cassius refused to lend him a few quid to pay his legions; and, you
    know, it&rsquo;s an unpardonable crime for one mate to refuse another a few
    quid when he&rsquo;s in a hole; but it seems that the messenger was but a
    fool who brought Cassius&rsquo;s answer back. It is generally the messenger
    who is to blame, when friends make it up after a quarrel that was all their
    own fault. Messengers had an uncomfortable time in those days, as witness
    the case of the base slave who had to bring Cleopatra the news of Antony&rsquo;s
    marriage with Octavia.</p>
  <p>But the quarrel scene is great for its deep knowledge of the hearts of men
    in matters of man to man&mdash;of man friend to man friend&mdash;and it is
    as humanly simple as a barney between two old bush mates that threatens to
    end in a bloody fist-fight and separation for life, but chances to end in
    a beer. This quarrel threatened to end in the death of either Brutus or Cassius
    or a set-to between their two armies, just at the moment when they all should
    have been knit together against the forces of Mark Antony and Octavius Caesar;
    but it ended in a beer, or its equivalent, a bowl of wine.</p>
  <p>Earlier in the quarrel, where Brutus asks why, after striking down the foremost
    man in all the world for supporting land agents and others, should they do
    the same thing and contaminate their fingers with base bribes?</p>
  <p class="note">I&rsquo;d rather be a dog and bay the moon,<br>
    Than such a Roman&mdash;</p>
  <p>Cassius says:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">Brutus, bait not me<br>
    I&rsquo;ll not endure it: you forget yourself,<br>
    To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,<br>
    Older in practice, abler than yourself<br>
    To make conditions.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Go to, you are not, Cassius.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    I am.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    I say you are not.</p>
  <p>And so they get to it again until:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Is it come to this?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    You say you are a better soldier:<br>
    Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,<br>
    And it shall please me well: for mine own part,<br>
    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;<br>
    I said, an elder soldier, not a better.<br>
    Did I say better?</p>
  <p>(What big boys they were-and what big boys we all are!)</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    If you did, I care not.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    When Caesar lived he durst not thus have moved me.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Peace, peace! you durst not thus have tempted him.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    I durst not!</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    No.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    What! Durst not tempt him!</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    For your life you durst mot.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Do not presume too much upon my love;<br>
    I may do that I shall be sorry for.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    You have done that you should be sorry for.</p>
  <p>And so on till he gets to the matter of the refused quids, which is cleared
    up at the expense of the messenger.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    . . . . Brutus hath rived my heart:<br>
    A friend should bear his friend&rsquo;s infirmities,<br>
    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    I do not, till you practise them on me,<br>
    Cassius: You love me not.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    I do not like your faults.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    A friendly eye could never see such faults.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    A flatterer&rsquo;s would not, though they do appear<br>
    As huge as high Olympus.</p>
  <p>Then Cassius lets himself go. He calls on Antony and young Octavius and
    all the rest of &rsquo;em to come and be revenged on him alone, for he&rsquo;s
    tired of the world (&ldquo;Cassius is aweary of the world,&rdquo; he says).
    He&rsquo;s hated by one he loves (that&rsquo;s Brutus). He&rsquo;s braved
    by his &ldquo;brother&rdquo; (Brutus), checked like a bondman, and Brutus
    keeps an eye on all his faults and puts &rsquo;em down in a note-book, and
    learns &rsquo;em over and gets &rsquo;em off by memory to cast in his teeth.
    He offers Brutus his dagger and bare breast and wants Brutus to take out
    his heart, which, he says, is richer than all the quids&mdash;or rather gold&mdash;which
    Brutus said he wouldn&rsquo;t lend him. He wants Brutus to strike him as
    he did Caesar, for he reckons that when Brutus hated Caesar worst he loved
    him far better than ever he loved Cassius.</p>
  <p>Remember these men were Southerners, like ourselves, not cold-blooded Northerners&mdash;and,
    in spite of the seemingly effeminate Italian temperament, as brave as our
    men were at Elands River. The reason of Brutus&rsquo;s seeming coldness and
    hardness during the quarrel is set forth in a startling manner later on,
    as only the greatest poet in this world could do it.</p>
  <p>Brutus tells him kindly to put up his pig-sticker (and button his shirt)
    and he could be just as mad or good-tempered as he liked, and do what he
    liked, Brutus wouldn&rsquo;t mind him:</p>
  <p class="note">. . . . Dishonour shall be humour.<br>
    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb<br>
    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,<br>
    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark<br>
    And straight is cold again.</p>
  <p>Whereupon Cassius weeps because he thinks Brutus is laughing at him.</p>
  <p class="note">Hath Cassius lived<br>
    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,<br>
    When grief and blood ill-temper&rsquo;d vexeth him.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    When I spoke that, I was ill-temper&rsquo;d too.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    And my heart too.</p>
  <p>Then Cassius explains that he got his temper from his mother (as I did mine).</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    O Brutus!</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    What&rsquo;s the matter? [Shakespeare should have added &ldquo;now.&rdquo;]</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Have not you love enough to bear with me,<br>
    When that rash humour which my mother gave me<br>
    Makes me forgetful?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,<br>
    When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,<br>
    He&rsquo;ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.</p>
  <p>And all this on the brink of disaster and death.</p>
  <p>But here comes a rare touch, and we might as well quote it in full.</p>
  <p>Mind you, I am following Shakespeare, and not history, which is mostly lies.</p>
  <p>A great poet&rsquo;s instinct might be nearer the truth, after all. Of course
    scholars know that Macbeth (or Macbethad) reigned for upwards of twenty years
    in Scotland a wise and a generous king&mdash;so much so that he was called  &ldquo;Macbathad
    the Liberal,&rdquo; and it was Duncan who found his way to the throne by
    way of murder; but it didn&rsquo;t fit in with Shakespeare&rsquo;s plans,
    and&mdash;anyway that&rsquo;s only a little matter between the ghosts of
    Bill and Mac which was doubtless fixed up long ago. More likely they thought
    it such a one-millionth part of a trifle that they never dreamed of thinking
    of mentioning it.</p>

  <p>Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall inherit a black eye (<i>Lawson</i>).
    Shakespeare was ever rough on poets&mdash;but stay! Consider that this great
    world of Rome and all the men and women in it were created by a &ldquo;jingling
    fool&rdquo; and a master of bad&mdash;not to say execrable&mdash;rhymes,
    and his name was William Shakespeare. You need to sit down and think awhile
    after that.</p>
  <p>Brutus sends Lucilius and Titinius to bid the commanders lodge their companies
    for the night, and then all come to him. Then he gives Cassius a shock and
    strikes him to the heart for his share in the quarrel. It is almost directly
    after the row, when they have kicked out the &ldquo;jingling fool&rdquo; of
    a poet. Cassius does not know that Brutus has to-day received news of the
    death, in Rome, of his good and true wife Portia, who, during a fit of insanity,
    brought on by her grief and anxiety for Brutus, and in the absence of her
    attendant, has poisoned herself&mdash;or &ldquo;swallowed fire,&rdquo; as

    he has as much strength in bearing trouble as Brutus has, and yet he couldn&rsquo;t

  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Well, to our work alive. What do you think<br>
    Of marching on Philippi presently?</p>
  <p>Brutus was a strong man. Portia&rsquo;s spirit must bide a while. They discuss
    a plan of campaign. Cassius is for waiting for the enemy to seek them and
    so get through his tucker and knock his men up, while they rest in a good
    position; but Brutus argues that the enemy will gather up the country people
    between Philippi and their camp and come on refreshed with added numbers
    and courage, and it would be better for them to meet him at Philippi with
    these people at their back. The politics or inclination of the said country
    people didn&rsquo;t matter in those days. &ldquo;There is a tide in the affairs
    of men&rdquo;&mdash;and so they decide to take it at the flood and float
    high on to the rocks at Philippi. Ah well, it led on to immortality, if it
    didn&rsquo;t to fortune.</p>
  <p>Well, there&rsquo;s no more to say. Brutus thinks that the main thing now
    is a little rest&mdash;in which you&rsquo;ll agree with him; and he sends
    for his night-shirt.</p>
  <p class="note">Good night, Titinius: noble, noble Cassius,<br>
    Good night, and good repose!</p>
  <p>That old fool of a Cassius&mdash;remorseful old smooth-bore&mdash;is still
    a bit maudlin&mdash;maybe he had another swig at the wine when Shakespeare
    wasn&rsquo;t looking.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    O my dear brother!<br>
    This was an ill beginning of the night:<br>
    Never come such division &rsquo;tween our souls!<br>
    Let it not, Brutus.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Everything is well.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Good night, my lord.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Good night, good brother.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Titinius</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Messala</i>:<br>
    Good nigbt, Lord Brutus.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Farewell, every one.</p>
  <p>And Cassius is the man whom Caesar denounced as having a lean and hungry
    look: &ldquo;Let me have men about me that are fat . . . such men are dangerous.&rdquo; (Mr
    Archibald held with that&mdash;and he had a lean, if not a hungry, look too.)
    When Antony put in a word for Cassius, Caesar said that he wished he was
    fatter anyhow. &ldquo;He thinks too much,&rdquo; Caesar said to Antony. He
    read a lot; he could look through men; he never went to the theatre, and
    heard no music; he never smiled except as if grinning sarcastically at himself
    for &ldquo;being moved to smile at anything.&rdquo; Caesar said that such
    men were never at heart&rsquo;s ease while they could see a bigger man than
    themselves, and therefore such men were dangerous. &ldquo;Come on my right
    hand, for this ear is deaf, and tell me truly what thou think&rsquo;st of
    him.&rdquo; (That&rsquo;s a touch, for deafness in people affected that way
    is usually greater in the left ear.)</p>
  <p>When Lucilius returned from taking a message from Brutus to Cassius&nbsp;<i>re</i>&nbsp;the
    loan of the fivers aforementioned and other matters&mdash;and before the
    arrival of Cassius with his horse and foot, and the quarrel&mdash;Brutus
    asked Lucilius what sort of a reception he had, and being told  &ldquo;With
    courtesy and respect enough,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;Thou hast described
    a hot friend cooling,&rdquo; and so on. But Cassius will cool no more until
    death cools him to-morrow at Philippi.</p>
  <p>The rare gentleness of Brutus&rsquo;s character&mdash;and of the characters
    of thousands of other bosses in trouble&mdash;is splendidly, and ah! so softly,
    pictured in the tent with his servants after the departure of the others.
    It is a purely domestic scene without a hint of home, women, or children&mdash;save
    that they themselves are big children. The scene now has the atmosphere of
    a soft, sad nightfall, after a long, long, hot and weary day full of toil
    and struggle and trouble&mdash;though it is really well on towards morning.</p>
  <p>Lucius comes in with the gown. Brutus says, &ldquo;Give me the gown,&rdquo;  and
    asks where his (Lucius&rsquo;s) musical instrument is, and Lucius replies
    that it&rsquo;s here in the tent. Brutus notices that he speaks drowsily. &ldquo;Poor
    knave, I blame thee not, thou are o&rsquo;er-watched.&rdquo; He tells him
    to call Claudius and some other of his men: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have them sleep
    on cushions in my tent.&rdquo; They come. He tells them he might have to
    send them on business by and by to his &ldquo;brother&rdquo;  Cassius, and
    bids them lie down and sleep, calling them sirs. They say they&rsquo;ll stand
    and watch his pleasure. &ldquo;I will not have it so; lie down, good sirs.&rdquo; He
    finds, in the pocket of his gown, a book he&rsquo;d been hunting high and
    low for&mdash;and had evidently given Lucius a warm time about&mdash;and
    he draws Lucius&rsquo;s attention to the fact:</p>
  <p class="note">Look, Lucius, here&rsquo;s the book I sought for so:<br>
    I put it in the pocket of my gown.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Lucius</i>:<br>
    I was sure your lordship did not give it to me.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful, etc.</p>
  <p>He asks Lucius if he can hold up his heavy eyes and touch his instrument
    a strain or two. But better give it all&mdash;it&rsquo;s not long:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Lucius</i>:<br>
    Ay, my lord, an&rsquo;t please you.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    It does, my boy:<br>
    I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Lucius</i>:<br>
    It is my duty, sir.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    I should not urge thy duty past thy might;<br>
    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Lucius</i>:<br>
    I have slept, my lord, already.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;<br>
    I will not hold thee long: if I do live,<br>
    I will be good to thee. (<i>Music, and a song.</i>)<br>
    This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,<br>
    Lay&rsquo;st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy<br>
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good-night;<br>
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:<br>
    If thou dolt nod, thou break&rsquo;st thy instrument;<br>
    I&rsquo;ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good-night.<br>
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn&rsquo;d down<br>
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>He
  sits down.</i>)</p>
  <p>A man for all time! How natural it all reads! You must remember that he
    is a tired man after a long, strenuous day such as none of us ever know.
    The fate of Rome and his&mdash;a much smaller matter&mdash;are hanging on
    the balance, and tomorrow will decide; but he is so mind-dulled and shoulder-weary
    under the tremendous burden of great things and of many griefs that he is
    almost apathetic; and over all is the cloud of a loss that he has not yet
    had time to realize. He is self-hypnotized, so to speak, and his mind mercifully
    dulled for the moment on the Sea of Fatalism.</p>
  <p align="center" class="note"><i>Enter</i>&nbsp;Ghost of Caesar </p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?<br>
    I think it is the weakness of mine eyes<br>
    That shapes this monstrous apparition.<br>
    It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?<br>
    Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil<br>
    That makest my blood cold, and my hair to stare?<br>
    Speak to me what thou art?</p>
  <p>His very &ldquo;scare,&rdquo; or rather his cold blood and staring hair
    are as things apart, to be analysed and explained quickly and put aside.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Ghost</i>:<br>
    Thy evil spirit, Brutus.</p>
  <p>That was frank enough, anyway.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Why comest thou?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Ghost</i>:<br>
    To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Well; then I shall see thee again?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Ghost</i>:<br>
    Ay, at Philippi.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>Vanishes.</i>)</p>
  <p>That was very satisfactory, so far. But Brutus, having taken heart, as he
    says, would hold more talk with the &ldquo;ill spirit.&rdquo; A ghost always
    needs to be taken quietly&mdash;it&rsquo;s no use getting excited and threshing
    round. But Caesar&rsquo;s, being a new-chum ghost and bashful, was doubtless
    embarrassed by his cool, matter-of-fact reception, and left. It didn&rsquo;t
    matter much. They were to meet soon, above Philippi, on more level terms.</p>
  <p>But I cannot get away from the idea that Caesar&rsquo;s ghost&rsquo;s visit
    was made in a friendly spirit. Who knows? Perhaps Portia&rsquo;s spirit had
    sent it to comfort Brutus: her own being prevented from going for some reason
    only known to the immortal gods.</p>
  <p>Then Brutus wakes them all.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Lucius</i>:<br>
    The strings, my lord, are false.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    He thinks he is still at his instrument.<br>
    Lucius, awake!</p>
  <p>And after questioning them as to whether they cried out in their sleep,
    or saw anything, he bids the boy sleep again (it is easy for tired boys to
    sleep at will in camp) and sends two of the others to Cassius to bid him
    get his forces on the way early and he would follow.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;<br>
    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,<br>
    And we will follow.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Varro</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Claudius</i>:<br>
    It shall be done, my lord.</p>
  <p>For, being a wise soldier, as well as a brave and gentle one, he reckoned,
    no doubt, that it would be best to have a strong man in the rear until the
    field was actually reached, for the benefit of would-be deserters, and unconsidered
    trifles of country people&mdash;and maybe for another reason not totally
    disconnected with his erratic friend Cassius.</p>
  <p>Just one more scene, and a very different one, before we hurry on to the
    end, as they have done to Philippi. It&rsquo;s the only scene in which those
    two unlucky Romans, Cassius and Brutus, seem to score.</p>
  <p>It is during the barney, or as Shakespeare calls it, the &ldquo;parley&rdquo;  before
    the battle. Those parleys never seemed to do any good&mdash;except to make
    matters worse, if I might put it like that: it&rsquo;s the same, under similar
    circumstances, right up to to-day. Enter on one side Octavius Caesar, Mark
    Antony, and their pals and army; and, on the other, Brutus and Cassius and
    the friends and followers of their falling fortunes.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Octavius</i>:<br>
    Not that we love words better, as you do.</p>
  <p class="note">You see, Octavius starts it.</p>
  <p class="note">Brutus lays himself open</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Antony</i>:<br>
    In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:<br>
    Witness the hole you made in Caesar&rsquo;s heart,<br>
    Crying, &ldquo;Long live! hail, Caesar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This is one for Brutus, though it contains a lie. But Cassius comes to the
    rescue:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    Antony,<br>
    The posture of your blows are yet unknown,<br>
    But, for your words, they rob the Hybla bees<br>
    And leave them honeyless.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Antony</i>:<br>
    Not stingless too.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    O, yes, and soundless too;<br>
    For you have stol&rsquo;n their buzzing, Antony,<br>
    And very wisely threat before you sting.</p>
  <p>That was one for Antony, and he gets mad. &ldquo;Villains!&rdquo; he yells,
    and he abuses them about their vile daggers hacking one another in the sides
    of Caesar (a little matter that ought to be worn threadbare by now), and
    calls them apes and hounds and bondmen and curs, and O, flatterers (which
    seems to be worst of all in his opinion&mdash;for he isn&rsquo;t one, you
    know), and damns &rsquo;em generally.</p>
  <p>Old Cassius remarks, &ldquo;Flatterers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Octavius breaks loose, and draws his Roman chopper and waves it round,
    and spreads himself out over Caesar&rsquo;s three-and-thirty wounds&mdash;which
    ought to be given a rest by this time, but only seem to be growing in number&mdash;and
    swears that he won&rsquo;t put up said chopper till said wounds are avenged,</p>
  <p class="note">Or till another Caesar<br>
    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.</p>
  <p>Brutus says quietly that he cannot die by traitors unless he brings &rsquo;em
    with him. (He sent one to Egypt later on.) Octavius says he hopes he wasn&rsquo;t
    born to die on Brutus&rsquo;s sword; and Brutus says, in effect, that even
    if he was any good he couldn&rsquo;t die more honourably.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,<br>
    Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassius</i>:<br>
    A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,<br>
    Join &lsquo;d with a masker and a reveller!</p>
  <p>Octavius calls off his dogs, and tells them to come on to-day if they dare,
    or if not, when they have stomachs.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cassias</i>:<br>
    Why, now, blow wind, swell billow, and swim bark!<br>
    The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.</p>
  <p>Yes, I reckon old Cassius (&ldquo;old&rdquo; in an affectionate sense) and
    Brutus came out top dogs from that scrap anyway. And, yes, Antony&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;good
    at orating. He was great at orating over dead men&mdash;especially dead &ldquo;friends&rdquo; (as
    he called his rivals) and dead enemies. Brutus was &ldquo;the noblest Roman
    of them all&rdquo; when Antony came across him stiff later on. Now when I
    die&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>Octavius, by the way, orated over Antony and his dusky hussy later on in
    Egypt, and they were the most &ldquo;famous pair&rdquo; in the world. I wonder
    whether the grim humour of it struck Octavius&nbsp;<i>then</i>: but then
    that young man seemed to have but little brains and less humour.</p>
  <p>But now they go to see about settling the matter with ironmongery. You can
    imagine the fight; the heat and the dust, for it was spring in a climate
    like ours. The bullocking, sweating, grunting, slaughter, the crack and clash
    and rattle as of fire-irons in a fender. The bad Latin language; the running
    away and chasing&nbsp;<i>en masse</i>&nbsp;and by individuals. The mutual
    pauses, the truces or spells&mdash;&ldquo;smoke-ho&rsquo;s&rdquo; we&rsquo;d
    call &rsquo;em&mdash;between masses and individuals. The battered-in, lost,
    discarded or stolen helmets; the blood-stained, dinted, and loosened armour
    with bits missing, and the bloody and grotesque bandages. The confusion amongst
    the soldiers, as it is to-day&mdash;the ignorance of one wing as to the fate
    of the other, of one party as to the fate of the other, of one individual
    as to the fate of another:</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills [directions to officers]<br>
    Unto the legions on the other side:</p>
  <p>Poor Cassius, routed and in danger of being surrounded, and thinking Brutus
    is in the same plight, or a prisoner or dead&mdash;and that Titinius is taken
    or killed&mdash;gets his bondman, whose life he once saved, to kill him in
    return for his freedom.</p>
  <p class="note">Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;<br>
    And when my face is cover&rsquo;d, as &rsquo;tis now,<br>
    Guide thou the sword.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Caesar,
  thou art revenged,<br>
    Even with the sword that kill&rsquo;d thee.</p>
  <p>Good-bye, Cassius, old chap!</p>
  <p>Titinius and Messala, coming too late, find Cassius dead; and Titinius,
    being left alone while Messala takes the news to Brutus, kills himself with
    Cassius&rsquo;s sword. Titinius, farewell!</p>
  <p>Come Brutus and those that are left.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Messala</i>:<br>
    Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>: Titinius&rsquo; face is upward.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Cato</i>:<br>
    He is slain.</p>
  <p>Grim mates in a grim day in a grim hour. Then the cry of Brutus:</p>
  <p class="note">O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!</p>
  <p>But if he were, perhaps he only gathered old Cassius and Titinius to be
    sure of their company with him and Brutus amongst the gods a little later.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Friends, I owe more tears<br>
    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.<br>
    I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.</p>
  <p>And, after making arrangements for the removal of Cassius&rsquo;s body,
    they go to try their fortunes in a second fight.</p>
  <p>Young Cato is killed and good Lucilius taken. Comes Brutus beaten, with
    Dardanius his last friend, and his three servants, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.</p>
  <p>Strato, exhausted, goes to sleep, as man can sleep during a battle; and
    Brutus whispers the others, one after another, to kill him; but they are
    shocked and refuse: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll rather kill myself,&rdquo; &ldquo;I
    do such a deed?&rdquo;  etc. He begs Volumnius, his old schoolmate, to hold
    his sword-hilt while he runs on it, for their love of old.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Volumnius</i>:<br>
    That&rsquo;s not the office for a friend, my lord.</p>
  <p class="note">There are alarums, and they urge him to fly, for it&rsquo;s
    no use stopping there.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.<br>
    Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;<br>
    Farewell to thee too, Strato! Countrymen,<br>
    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life<br>
    I found no man but he was true to me.</p>
  <p>Ye gods! but it&rsquo;s grand. I wish to our God that I could say as much&mdash;or
    that man or woman ever found me untrue. Could Antony say as much, afterwards,
    in Egypt&mdash;or Octavius? with Antony then on his mind? Even Antony&rsquo;s
    last man and servant failed him in the end, killing himself rather than kill
    his master. But Strato&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>There are more alarums and voices calling to them to run. They urge Brutus
    again, and he tells them to go and he&rsquo;ll follow. They all run except
    Strato, who hesitates.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:<br>
    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;<br>
    Thy life hath had some snatch of honour in it:<br>
    Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,<br>
    While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Strato</i>:<br>
    Give me your hand first: fare you well, my lord.</p>
  <p class="note"><i>Brutus</i>:<br>
    Farewell, good Strato. Caesar, now be still:<br>
    I kill&rsquo;d not thee with half so good a will.</p>
  <p>Brutus, good night!</p>
  <p>I like Shakespeare&rsquo;s servants. They seem to show that he sprang from
    servants or common people rather than from lords and masters, for he deals
    with them very gently. It must be understood that servants, bond and free,
    were born unto the same house and served it for generations; and so down
    to modern England, where the old nurse and the tottering old gardener often
    nursed and played with &ldquo;Master Will,&rdquo; when his father, the dead
    and gone old squire, was a young man.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="SendRoundtheHat"></a>Send Round the Hat</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Now this is the creed from the Book of the Bush&mdash;<br>
    Should be simple and plain to a dunce:<br>
  &ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s in a hole you must pass round the hat&mdash;<br>
    Were he jail-bird or gentleman once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is&nbsp;it any harm to wake yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was about nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and, though it was Sunday
    morning, it was no harm to wake me; but the shearer had mistaken me for a
    deaf jackeroo, who was staying at the shanty and was something like me, and
    had good-naturedly shouted almost at the top of his voice, and he woke the
    whole shanty. Anyway he woke three or four others who were sleeping on beds
    and stretchers, and one on a shake-down on the floor, in the same room. It
    had been a wet night, and the shanty was full of shearers from Big Billabong
    Shed which had cut out the day before. My room mates had been drinking and
    gambling overnight, and they swore luridly at the intruder for disturbing
    them.</p>
  <p>He was six-foot-three or thereabout. He was loosely built, bony, sandy-complexioned
    and grey eyed. He wore a good-humoured grin at most times, as I noticed later
    on; he was of a type of bushman that I always liked&mdash;the sort that seem
    to get more good-natured the longer they grow, yet are hardknuckled and would
    accommodate a man who wanted to fight, or thrash a bully in a good-natured
    way. The sort that like to carry somebody&rsquo;s baby round, and cut wood,
    carry water and do little things for overworked married bushwomen. He wore
    a saddle-tweed sac suit two sizes too small for him, and his face, neck,
    great hands and bony wrists were covered with sunblotches and freckles.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope I ain&rsquo;t disturbin&rsquo; yer,&rdquo; he shouted, as
    he bent over my bunk, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a cove&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t shout!&rdquo; I interrupted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
    deaf.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I beg your pardon!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
    know I was yellin&rsquo;. I thought you was the deaf feller.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
    trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait till them other chaps is done swearin&rsquo; and I&rsquo;ll
    tell yer,&rdquo;  he said. He spoke with a quiet, good-natured drawl, with
    something of the nasal twang, but tone and drawl distinctly Australian&mdash;altogether
    apart from that of the Americans.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, spit it out for Christ&rsquo;s sake, Long&rsquo;un!&rdquo; yelled
    One-eyed Bogan, who had been the worst swearer in a rough shed, and he fell
    back on his bunk as if his previous remarks had exhausted him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that there sick jackeroo that was pickin&rsquo;-up at
    Big Billabong,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;He had to knock off the first
    week, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s been here ever since. They&rsquo;re sendin&rsquo; him
    away to the hospital in Sydney by the speeshall train. They&rsquo;re just
    goin&rsquo; to take him up in the wagonette to the railway station, an&rsquo; I
    thought I might as well go round with the hat an&rsquo; get him a few bob.
    He&rsquo;s got a missus and kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yer always goin&rsquo; round with yer gory hat!&rdquo; growled Bogan. &ldquo;Yer&rsquo;d
    blanky well take it round in hell!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what he&rsquo;s doing, Bogan,&rdquo; muttered Gentleman
    Once, on the shake-down, with his face to the wall.</p>
  <p>The hat was a genuine &ldquo;cabbage-tree,&rdquo; one of the sort that &ldquo;last
    a lifetime.&rdquo; It was well coloured, almost black in fact with weather
    and age, and it had a new strap round the base of the crown. I looked into
    it and saw a dirty pound note and some silver. I dropped in half a crown,
    which was more than I could spare, for I had only been a green-hand at Big
    Billabong.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now then, you fellers!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d keep your hat on your head, and your money in
    your pockets and your sympathy somewhere else,&rdquo; growled Jack Moonlight
    as he raised himself painfully on his elbow and felt under his pillow for
    two half-crowns.  &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s two half-carers.
    Chuck &rsquo;em in and let me sleep for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gentleman Once, the gambler, rolled round on his shakedown, bringing his
    good-looking, dissipated face from the wall. He had turned in in his clothes
    and, with considerable exertion he shoved his hand down into the pocket of
    his trousers, which were a tight fit. He brought up a roll of pound notes
    and could find no silver.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; he said to the Giraffe, &ldquo;I might as well lay a
    quid. I&rsquo;ll chance it anyhow. Chuck it in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got rats this mornin&rsquo;, Gentleman Once,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan.  &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a blanky horse race.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps I have,&rdquo; said Gentleman Once, and he turned
    to the wall again with his head on his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, Bogan, yer might as well chuck in somethin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the jackeroo?&rdquo; asked the Bogan,
    tugging his trousers from under the mattress.</p>
  <p>Moonlight said something in a low tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The &mdash;&mdash; he has!&rdquo; said Bogan. &ldquo;Well, I pity
    the &mdash;&mdash;! Here, I&rsquo;ll chuck in half a &mdash;&mdash; quid!&rdquo; and
    he dropped half a sovereign into the hat.</p>
  <p>The fourth man, who was known to his face as &ldquo;BarcooRot,&rdquo; and
    behind his back as &ldquo;The Mean Man,&rdquo; had been drinking all night,
    and not even Bogan&rsquo;s stump-splitting adjectives could rouse him. So
    Bogan got out of bed, and calling on us (as blanky female cattle) to witness
    what he was about to do, he rolled the drunkard over, prospected his pockets
    till he made up five shillings (or a &ldquo;caser&rdquo; in bush language),
    and &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; them into the hat.</p>
  <p>And Barcoo-Rot is probably unconscious to this day that he was ever connected
    with an act of charity.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe struck the deaf jackeroo in the next room. I heard the chaps
    cursing &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for waking them, and &ldquo;Deaf-&rsquo;un&rdquo; for
    being, as they thought at first, the indirect cause of the disturbance. I
    heard the Giraffe and his hat being condemned in other rooms and cursed along
    the veranda where more shearers were sleeping; and after a while I turned
    out.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was carefully fixing a mattress and pillows on the floor of
    a wagonette, and presently a man, who looked like a corpse, was carried out
    and lifted into the trap.</p>
  <p>As the wagonette started, the shanty-keeper&mdash;a fat, soulless-looking
    man&mdash;put his hand in his pocket and dropped a quid into the hat which
    was still going round, in the hands of the Giraffe&rsquo;s mate, little Teddy
    Thompson, who was as far below medium height as the Giraffe was above it.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe took the horse&rsquo;s head and led him along on the most level
    parts of the road towards the railway station, and two or three chaps went
    along to help get the sick man into the train.</p>
  <p>The shearing-season was over in that district, but I got a job of house-painting,
    which was my trade, at the Great Western Hotel (a two-story brick place),
    and I stayed in Bourke for a couple of months.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was a Victorian native from Bendigo. He was well known in Bourke
    and to many shearers who came through the great dry scrubs from hundreds
    of miles round. He was stakeholder, drunkard&rsquo;s banker, peacemaker where
    possible, referee or second to oblige the chaps when a fight was on, big
    brother or uncle to most of the children in town, final court of appeal when
    the youngsters had a dispute over a foot-race at the school picnic, referee
    at their fights, and he was the stranger&rsquo;s friend.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The feller as knows can battle around for himself,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d
    say.  &ldquo;But I always like to do what I can for a hard-up stranger cove.
    I was a green-hand jackeroo once meself, and I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re always bothering about other people, Giraffe,&rdquo; said
    Tom Hall, the shearers&rsquo; union secretary, who was only a couple of inches
    shorter than the Giraffe. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in it, you can take
    it from me&mdash;I ought to know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s a feller to do?&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
    only hangin&rsquo;  round here till shearin&rsquo; starts agen, an&rsquo; a
    cove might as well be doin&rsquo;  something. Besides, it ain&rsquo;t as
    if I was like a cove that had old people or a wife an&rsquo; kids to look
    after. I ain&rsquo;t got no responsibilities. A feller can&rsquo;t be doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo;.
    Besides, I like to lend a helpin&rsquo; hand when I can.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, all I&rsquo;ve got to say,&rdquo; said Tom, most of whose screw
    went in borrowed quids, etc. &ldquo;All I&rsquo;ve got to say is that you&rsquo;ll
    get no thanks, and you might blanky well starve in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no fear of me starvin&rsquo; so long as I&rsquo;ve
    got me hands about me; an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t a cove as wants thanks,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was always helping some-one or something. Now it was a bit of a  &ldquo;darnce&rdquo; that
    we was gettin&rsquo; up for the girls; again it was Mrs Smith, the woman
    whose husban&rsquo; was drowned in the flood in the Bogan River lars&rsquo; Crismas,
    or that there poor woman down by the Billabong&mdash;her husband cleared
    out and left her with a lot o&rsquo; kids. Or Bill Something, the bullocky,
    who was run over by his own wagon, while he was drunk, and got his leg broke.</p>
  <p>Toward the end of his spree One-eyed Bogan broke loose and smashed nearly
    all the windows of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, and next morning he was fined
    heavily at the police court. About dinner-time I encountered the Giraffe
    and his hat, with two half-crowns in it for a start.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but One-eyed
    Bogan carn&rsquo;t pay his fine, an&rsquo; I thought we might fix it up for
    him. He ain&rsquo;t half a bad sort of feller when he ain&rsquo;t drinkin&rsquo;.
    It&rsquo;s only when he gets too much booze in him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After shearing, the hat usually started round with the Giraffe&rsquo;s own
    dirty crumpled pound note in the bottom of it as a send-off, later on it
    was half a sovereign, and so on down to half a crown and a shilling, as he
    got short of stuff; till in the end he would borrow a &ldquo;few bob&rdquo;&mdash;which
    he always repaid after next shearing&mdash;&ldquo;just to start the thing
    goin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were several yarns about him and his hat. &rsquo;Twas said that the
    hat had belonged to his father, whom he resembled in every respect, and it
    had been going round for so many years that the crown was worn as thin as
    paper by the quids, halfquids, casers, half-casers, bobs and tanners or sprats&mdash;to
    say nothing of the scrums&mdash;that had been chucked into it in its time
    and shaken up.</p>
  <p>They say that when a new governor visited Bourke the Giraffe happened to
    be standing on the platform close to the exit, grinning good-humouredly,
    and the local toady nudged him urgently and said in an awful whisper, &ldquo;Take
    off your hat! Why don&rsquo;t you take off your hat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t hard up, is
    he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And they fondly cherish an anecdote to the effect that, when the One-Man-One-Vote
    Bill was passed (or Payment of Members, or when the first Labour Party went
    in&mdash;I forget on which occasion they said it was) the Giraffe was carried
    away by the general enthusiasm, got a few beers in him, &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; a
    quid into his hat, and sent it round. The boys contributed by force of habit,
    and contributed largely, because of the victory and the beer. And when the
    hat came back to the Giraffe, he stood holding it in front of him with both
    hands and stared blankly into it for a while. Then it dawned on him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blowed if I haven&rsquo;t bin an&rsquo; gone an&rsquo; took up a
    bloomin&rsquo; collection for meself!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>He was almost a teetotaller, but he stood his shout in reason. He mostly
    drank ginger beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a feller that boozes, but I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen
    chaps enjoyin&rsquo; themselves, so long as they don&rsquo;t go too far.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was common for a man on the spree to say to him:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here! here&rsquo;s five quid. Look after it for me, Giraffe, will
    yer, till I git off the booze.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His real name was Bob Brothers, and his bush names, &ldquo;Long-&rsquo;un,&rdquo;  &ldquo;The
    Giraffe,&rdquo; &ldquo;Send-round-the-hat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chuck-in-a-bob,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ginger-ale.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Some years before, camels and Afghan drivers had been imported to the Bourke
    district; the camels did very well in the dry country, they went right across
    country and carried everythink from sardines to flooring-boards. And the
    teamsters loved the Afghans nearly as much as Sydney furniture makers love
    the cheap Chinese in the same line. They love &rsquo;em even as union shearers
    on strike love blacklegs brought up-country to take their places.</p>
  <p>Now the Giraffe was a good, straight unionist, but in cases of sickness
    or trouble he was as apt to forget his unionism, as all bushmen are, at all
    times (and for all time), to forget their creed. So, one evening, the Giraffe
    blundered into the Carriers&rsquo; Arms&mdash;of all places in the world&mdash;when
    it was full of teamsters; he had his hat in his hand and some small silver
    and coppers in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, you fellers, there&rsquo;s a poor, sick Afghan in the camp
    down there along the&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A big, brawny bullock-driver took him firmly by the shoulders, or, rather
    by the elbows, and ran him out before any damage was done. The Giraffe took
    it as he took most things, good-humouredly; but, about dusk, he was seen
    slipping down towards the Afghan camp with a billy of soup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; remarked Tom Hall, &ldquo;that when the Giraffe
    goes to heaven&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the only one of us, as far as I can see,
    that has a ghost of a show&mdash;I believe that when he goes to heaven, the
    first thing he&rsquo;ll do will be to take his infernal hat round amongst
    the angels&mdash;getting up a collection for this damned world that he left
    behind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s so much to his credit, after
    all,&rdquo;  said Jack Mitchell, shearer. &ldquo;You see, the Giraffe is
    ambitious; he likes public life, and that accounts for him shoving himself
    forward with his collections. As for bothering about people in trouble, that&rsquo;s
    only common curiosity; he&rsquo;s one of those chaps that are always shoving
    their noses into other people&rsquo;s troubles. And, as for looking after
    sick men&mdash;why! there&rsquo;s nothing the Giraffe likes better than pottering
    round a sick man, and watching him and studying him. He&rsquo;s awfully interested
    in sick men, and they&rsquo;re pretty scarce out here. I tell you there&rsquo;s
    nothing he likes better&mdash;except, maybe, it&rsquo;s pottering round a
    corpse. I believe he&rsquo;d ride forty miles to help and sympathize and
    potter round a funeral. The fact of the matter is that the Giraffe is only
    enjoying himself with other people&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;that&rsquo;s all
    it is. It&rsquo;s only vulgar curiosity and selfishness. I set it down to
    his ignorance; the way he was brought up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days after the Afghan incident the Giraffe and his hat had a run of
    luck. A German, one of a party who were building a new wooden bridge over
    the Big Billabong, was helping unload some girders from a truck at the railway
    station, when a big log slipped on the skids and his leg was smashed badly.
    They carried him to the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, which was the nearest hotel,
    and into a bedroom behind the bar, and sent for the doctor. The Giraffe was
    in evidence as usual.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It vas not that at all,&rdquo; said German Charlie, when they asked
    him if he was in much pain. &ldquo;It vas not that at all. I don&rsquo;t
    cares a damn for der bain; but dis is der tird year&mdash;und I vas going
    home dis year&mdash;after der gontract&mdash;und der gontract yoost commence!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>That was the burden of his song all through, between his groans.</p>
  <p>There were a good few chaps sitting quietly about the bar and veranda when
    the doctor arrived. The Giraffe was sitting at the end of the counter, on
    which he had laid his hat while he wiped his face, neck, and forehead with
    a big speckled &ldquo;sweatrag.&rdquo; It was a very hot day.</p>
  <p>The doctor, a good-hearted young Australian, was heard saying something.
    Then German Charlie, in a voice that rung with pain:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Make that leg right, doctor&mdash;quick! Dis is der tird pluddy year&mdash;und
    I must go home!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The doctor asked him if he was in great pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neffer mind der pluddy bain, doctor! Neffer mind der pluddy bain!
    Dot vas nossing. Make dat leg well quick, doctor. Dis vas der last gontract,
    and I vas going home dis year.&rdquo; Then the words jerked out of him by
    physical agony: &ldquo;Der girl vas vaiting dree year, und&mdash;by Got!
    I must go home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The publican&mdash;Watty Braithwaite, known as &ldquo;Watty Broadweight,&rdquo; or,
    more familiarly, &ldquo;Watty Bothways&rdquo;&mdash;turned over the Giraffe&rsquo;s
    hat in a tired, bored sort of way, dropped a quid into it, and nodded resignedly
    at the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe caught up the hint and the hat with alacrity. The hat went all
    round town, so to speak; and, as soon as his leg was firm enough not to come
    loose on the road German Charlie went home.</p>
  <p>It was well known that I contributed to the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;and
    several other papers. The Giraffe&rsquo;s bump of reverence was very large,
    and swelled especially for sick men and poets. He treated me with much more
    respect than is due from a bushman to a man, and with an odd sort of extra
    gentleness I sometimes fancied. But one day he rather surprised me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to trouble yer,&rdquo; he said in a shamefaced way. &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t know as you go in for sportin&rsquo;, but One-eyed Bogan an&rsquo; Barcoo-Rot
    is goin&rsquo; to have a bit of a scrap down the Billybong this evenin&rsquo;,
    an&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of a what?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A bit of fight to a finish,&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;An&rsquo; the
    chaps is tryin&rsquo; to fix up a fiver to put some life into the thing.
    There&rsquo;s bad blood between One-eyed Bogan and BarcooRot, an&rsquo; it
    won&rsquo;t do them any harm to have it out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a great fight, I remember. There must have been a couple of score
    blood-soaked handkerchiefs (or &ldquo;sweat-rags&rdquo;) buried in a hole
    on the field of battle, and the Giraffe was busy the rest of the evening
    helping to patch up the principals. Later on he took up a small collection
    for the loser, who happened to be Barcoo-Rot in spite of the advantage of
    an eye.</p>
  <p>The Salvation Army lassie, who went round with the War Cry, nearly always
    sold the Giraffe three copies.</p>
  <p>A new-chum parson, who wanted a subscription to build or enlarge a chapel,
    or something, sought the assistance of the Giraffe&rsquo;s influence with
    his mates.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Giraffe, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a churchgoer
    meself. I ain&rsquo;t what you might call a religious cove, but I&rsquo;ll
    be glad to do what I can to help yer. I don&rsquo;t suppose I can do much.
    I ain&rsquo;t been to church since I was a kiddy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The parson was shocked, but later on he learned to appreciate the Giraffe
    and his mates, and to love Australia for the bushman&rsquo;s sake, and it
    was he who told me the above anecdote.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe helped fix some stalls for a Catholic Church bazaar, and some
    of the chaps chaffed him about it in the union office.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be taking up a collection for a joss-house down in the
    Chinamen&rsquo;s camp next,&rdquo; said Tom Hall in conclusion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; agen the Roming Carflics,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo; Father O&rsquo;Donovan&rsquo;s a very decent
    sort of cove. He stuck up for the unions all right in the strike anyway.&rdquo; (&ldquo;He
    wouldn&rsquo;t be Irish if he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; someone commented.) &ldquo;I
    carried swags once for six months with a feller that was a Carflick, an&rsquo; he
    was a very straight feller. And a girl I knowed turned Carflick to marry
    a chap that had got her into trouble, an&rsquo; she was always jes&rsquo;  the
    same to me after as she was before. Besides, I like to help everything that&rsquo;s
    goin&rsquo; on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall and one or two others went out hurriedly to have a drink. But we
    all loved the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>He was very innocent and very humorous, especially when he meant to be most
    serious and philosophical.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Some of them bush girls is regular tomboys,&rdquo; he said to me
    solemnly one day. &ldquo;Some of them is too cheeky altogether. I remember
    once I was stoppin&rsquo; at a place&mdash;they was sort of relations o&rsquo; mine&mdash;an&rsquo; they
    put me to sleep in a room off the verander, where there was a glass door
    an&rsquo; no blinds. An&rsquo; the first mornin&rsquo; the girls&mdash;they
    was sort o&rsquo; cousins o&rsquo; mine&mdash;they come gigglin&rsquo; and
    foolin&rsquo; round outside the door on the verander, an&rsquo; kep&rsquo; me
    in bed till nearly ten o&rsquo;clock. I had to put me trowsis on under the
    bed-clothes in the end. But I got back on &rsquo;em the next night,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you do that, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, I went to bed in me trowsis!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One day I was on a plank, painting the ceiling of the bar of the Great Western
    Hotel. I was anxious to get the job finished. The work had been kept back
    most of the day by chaps handing up long beers to me, and drawing my attention
    to the alleged fact that I was putting on the paint wrong side out. I was
    slapping it on over the last few boards when:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to trouble yer; I always seem to be troublin&rsquo;  yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there woman and them girls&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked down&mdash;about the first time I had looked down on him&mdash;and
    there was the Giraffe, with his hat brim up on the plank and two half-crowns
    in it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, Bob,&rdquo; I said, and I dropped in
    half a crown.</p>
  <p>There were shearers in the bar, and presently there was some barracking.
    It appeared that that there woman and them girls were strange women, in the
    local as well as the Biblical sense of the word, who had come from Sydney
    at the end of the shearing-season, and had taken a cottage on the edge of
    the scrub on the outskirts of the town. There had been trouble this week
    in connection with a row at their establishment, and they had been fined,
    warned off by the police, and turned out by their landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This is a bit too red-hot, Giraffe,&rdquo; said one of the shearers.  &ldquo;Them &mdash;&mdash;s
    has made enough out of us coves. They&rsquo;ve got plenty of stuff, don&rsquo;t
    you fret. Let &rsquo;em go to &mdash;&mdash;! I&rsquo;m blanked if I give
    a sprat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They ain&rsquo;t got their fares to Sydney,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;An&rsquo;,
    what&rsquo;s more, the little &rsquo;un is sick, an&rsquo; two of them has
    kids in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How the &mdash;&mdash; do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, one of &rsquo;em come to me an&rsquo; told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was an involuntary guffaw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Bob,&rdquo; said Billy Woods, the rouseabouts&rsquo; secretary,
    kindly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you make a fool of yourself. You&rsquo;ll have
    all the chaps laughing at you. Those girls are only working you for all you&rsquo;re
    worth. I suppose one of  &rsquo;em came crying and whining to you. Don&rsquo;t
    you bother about &rsquo;em. You don&rsquo;t know  &rsquo;em; they can pump
    water at a moment&rsquo;s notice. You haven&rsquo;t had any experience with
    women yet, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t come whinin&rsquo; and cryin&rsquo; to me,&rdquo; said
    the Giraffe, dropping his twanging drawl a little. &ldquo;She looked me straight
    in the face an&rsquo;  told me all about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I say, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, &ldquo;what have
    you been doin&rsquo;? You&rsquo;ve bin down there on the nod. I&rsquo;m surprised
    at yer, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; he pretends to be so gory soft an&rsquo; innocent, too,&rdquo; growled
    the Bogan. &ldquo;We know all about you, Giraffe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Mitchell the shearer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
    never have thought it of you. We all thought you were the only virgin youth
    west the river; I always thought you were a moral young man. You mustn&rsquo;t
    think that because your conscience is pricking you everyone else&rsquo;s
    is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t had anythin&rsquo; to do with them,&rdquo; said the
    Giraffe, drawling again. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a cove that goes in for that
    sort of thing. But other chaps has, and I think they might as well help &rsquo;em
    out of their fix.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re a rotten crowd,&rdquo; said Billy Woods. &ldquo;You
    don&rsquo;t know them, Bob. Don&rsquo;t bother about them&mdash;they&rsquo;re
    not worth it. Put your money in your pocket. You&rsquo;ll find a better use
    for it before next shearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better shout, Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks.</p>
  <p>Now in spite of the Giraffe&rsquo;s softness he was the hardest man in Bourke
    to move when he&rsquo;d decided on what he thought was &ldquo;the fair thing
    to do.&rdquo;  Another peculiarity of his was that on occasion, such for
    instance as &ldquo;sayin&rsquo; a few words&rdquo; at a strike meeting, he
    would straighten himself, drop the twang, and rope in his drawl, so to speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said now. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    know anything about them women. I s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;re bad, but I don&rsquo;t
    suppose they&rsquo;re worse than men has made them. All I know is that there&rsquo;s
    four women turned out, without any stuff, and every woman in Bourke, an&rsquo; the
    police, an&rsquo; the law agen &rsquo;em. An&rsquo;  the fact that they is
    women is agenst &rsquo;em most of all. You don&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;em to
    hump their swags to Sydney! Why, only I ain&rsquo;t got the stuff I wouldn&rsquo;t
    trouble yer. I&rsquo;d pay their fares meself. Look,&rdquo; he said, lowering
    his voice, &ldquo;there they are now, an&rsquo; one of the girls is cryin&rsquo;.
    Don&rsquo;t let &rsquo;em see yer lookin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I dropped softly from the plank and peeped out with the rest.</p>
  <p>They stood by the fence on the opposite side of the street, a bit up towards
    the railway station, with their portmanteaux and bundles at their feet. One
    girl leant with her arms on the fence rail and her face buried in them, another
    was trying to comfort her. The third girl and the woman stood facing our
    way. The woman was good-looking; she had a hard face, but it might have been
    made hard. The third girl seemed half defiant, half inclined to cry. Presently
    she went to the other side of the girl who was crying on the fence and put
    her arm round her shoulder. The woman suddenly turned her back on us and
    stood looking away over the paddocks.</p>
  <p>The hat went round. Billy Woods was first, then Box-o&rsquo;Tricks, and
    then Mitchell.</p>
  <p>Billy contributed with eloquent silence. &ldquo;I was only jokin&rsquo;,
    Giraffe,&rdquo; said Box-o&rsquo;-Tricks, dredging his pockets for a couple
    of shillings. It was some time after the shearing, and most of the chaps
    were hard up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; sighed Mitchell. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no help for
    it. If the Giraffe would take up a collection to import some decent girls
    to this God-forgotten hole there might be some sense in it. . . . It&rsquo;s
    bad enough for the Giraffe to undermine our religious prejudices, and tempt
    us to take a morbid interest in sick Chows and Afghans, and blacklegs and
    widows; but when he starts mixing us up with strange women it&rsquo;s time
    to buck.&rdquo; And he prospected his pockets and contributed two shillings,
    some odd pennies, and a pinch of tobacco dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind helping the girls, but I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll
    give a penny to help the old&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; said Tom Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, she was a girl once herself,&rdquo; drawled the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>The Giraffe went round to the other pubs and to the union offices, and when
    he returned he seemed satisfied with the plate, but troubled about something
    else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to do for them for to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;None
    of the pubs or boardin&rsquo;-houses will hear of them, an&rsquo; there ain&rsquo;t
    no empty houses, an&rsquo; the women is all agen &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not all,&rdquo; said Alice, the big, handsome barmaid from Sydney.  &ldquo;Come
    here, Bob.&rdquo; She gave the Giraffe half a sovereign and a look for which
    some of us would have paid him ten pounds&mdash;had we had the money, and
    had the look been transferable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, Bob,&rdquo; she said, and she went in to speak to
    the landlord.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an empty bedroom at the end of the store in the yard,&rdquo;  she
    said when she came back. &ldquo;They can camp there for to-night if they
    behave themselves. You&rsquo;d better tell &rsquo;em, Bob.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank yer, Alice,&rdquo; said the Giraffe.</p>
  <p>Next day, after work, the Giraffe and I drifted together and down by the
    river in the cool of the evening, and sat on the edge of the steep, drought-parched
    bank.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard you saw your lady friends off this morning, Bob,&rdquo; I
    said, and was sorry I said it, even before he answered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, they ain&rsquo;t no friends of mine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Only
    four poor devils of women. I thought they mightn&rsquo;t like to stand waitin&rsquo; with
    the crowd on the platform, so I jest offered to get their tickets an&rsquo; told &rsquo;em
    to wait round at the back of the station till the bell rung. . . . An&rsquo; what
    do yer think they did, Harry?&rdquo; he went on, with an exasperatingly unintelligent
    grin.  &ldquo;Why, they wanted to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. An&rsquo; they would have done it, too, if I hadn&rsquo;t been
    so long. . . . Why, I&rsquo;m blessed if they didn&rsquo;t kiss me hands.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s truth. Somehow I didn&rsquo;t like to go on the platform
    with them after that; besides, they was cryin&rsquo;, and I can&rsquo;t stand
    women cryin&rsquo;. But some of the chaps put them into an empty carriage.&rdquo; He
    thought a moment. Then:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers in the world,&rdquo; he
    reflected.</p>
  <p>I thought so too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a single man. Why don&rsquo;t
    you get married and settle down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no wife an&rsquo; kids,
    that&rsquo;s a fact. But it ain&rsquo;t my fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He may have been right about the wife. But I thought of the look that Alice
    had given him, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Girls seem to like me right enough,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but it
    don&rsquo;t go no further than that. The trouble is that I&rsquo;m so long,
    and I always seem to get shook after little girls. At least there was one
    little girl in Bendigo that I was properly gone on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And wouldn&rsquo;t she have you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ask her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I asked her right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, and what did she say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She said it would be redicilus for her to be seen trotting alongside
    of a chimbley like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t mean that. There are any amount of little
    women who like tall men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought of that too&mdash;afterwards. P&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps she didn&rsquo;t
    mean it that way. I s&rsquo;pose the fact of the matter was that she didn&rsquo;t
    cotton on to me, and wanted to let me down easy. She didn&rsquo;t want to
    hurt me feelin&rsquo;s, if yer understand&mdash;she was a very good-hearted
    little girl. There&rsquo;s some terrible tall fellers where I come from,
    and I know two as married little girls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed a hopeless case.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sometimes I wish that I wasn&rsquo;t
    so blessed long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s that there deaf jackeroo,&rdquo; he reflected presently. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
    something in the same fix about girls as I am. He&rsquo;s too deaf and I&rsquo;m
    too long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s got three
    girls, to my knowledge, and, as for being deaf, why, he gasses more than
    any man in the town, and knows more of what&rsquo;s going on than old Mother
    Brindle the washerwoman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, look at that now!&rdquo; said the Giraffe, slowly. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
    have thought it? He never told me he had three girls, an&rsquo; as for hearin&rsquo; news,
    I always tell him anything that&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; on that I think he doesn&rsquo;t
    catch. He told me his trouble was that whenever he went out with a girl people
    could hear what they was sayin&rsquo;&mdash;at least they could hear what
    she was sayin&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; draw their own conclusions, he said.
    He said he went out one night with a girl, and some of the chaps foxed &rsquo;em
    an&rsquo; heard her sayin&rsquo; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; to him, an&rsquo; put
    it all round town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did she say &lsquo;don&rsquo;t&rsquo; for?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell me that, but I s&rsquo;pose he was kissin&rsquo; her
    or huggin&rsquo; her or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bob,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;didn&rsquo;t you try the little
    girl in Bendigo a second time?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What was the use. She was a good little
    girl, and I wasn&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to go botherin&rsquo; her. I ain&rsquo;t
    the sort of cove that goes hangin&rsquo;  round where he isn&rsquo;t wanted.
    But somehow I couldn&rsquo;t stay about Bendigo after she gave me the hint,
    so I thought I&rsquo;d come over an&rsquo; have a knock round on this side
    for a year or two.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you never wrote to her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. What was the use of goin&rsquo; pesterin&rsquo; her with letters?
    I know what trouble letters give me when I have to answer one. She&rsquo;d
    have only had to tell me the straight truth in a letter an&rsquo; it wouldn&rsquo;t
    have done me any good. But I&rsquo;ve pretty well got over it by this time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A few days later I went to Sydney. The Giraffe was the last I shook hands
    with from the carriage window, and he slipped something in a piece of newspaper
    into my hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hope yer won&rsquo;t be offended,&rdquo; he drawled, &ldquo;but
    some of the chaps thought you mightn&rsquo;t be too flush of stuff&mdash;you&rsquo;ve
    been shoutin&rsquo; a good deal; so they put a quid or two together. They
    thought it might help yer to have a bit of a fly round in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>I was back in Bourke before next shearing. On the evening of my arrival
    I ran against the Giraffe; he seemed strangely shaken over something, but
    he kept his hat on his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would yer mind takin&rsquo; a stroll as fur as the Billerbong?&rdquo; he
    said. &ldquo;I got something I&rsquo;d like to tell yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His big, brown, sunburnt hands trembled and shook as he took a letter from
    his pocket and opened it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just got a letter,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A letter from
    that little girl at Bendigo. It seems it was all a mistake. I&rsquo;d like
    you to read it. Somehow I feel as if I want to talk to a feller, and I&rsquo;d
    rather talk to you than any of them other chaps.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It was a good letter, from a big-hearted little girl. She had been breaking
    her heart for the great ass all these months. It seemed that he had left
    Bendigo without saying good-bye to her. &ldquo;Somehow I couldn&rsquo;t bring
    meself to it,&rdquo; he said, when I taxed him with it. She had never been
    able to get his address until last week; then she got it from a Bourke man
    who had gone south. She called him &ldquo;an awful long fool,&rdquo; which
    he was, without the slightest doubt, and she implored him to write, and come
    back to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And will you go back, Bob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My oath! I&rsquo;d take the train to-morrer only I ain&rsquo;t got
    the stuff. But I&rsquo;ve got a stand in Big Billerbong Shed an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll
    soon knock a few quid together. I&rsquo;ll go back as soon as ever shearin&rsquo;s
    over. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to write away to her to-night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe was the &ldquo;ringer&rdquo; of Big Billabong Shed that season.
    His tallies averaged a hundred and twenty a day. He only sent his hat round
    once during shearing, and it was noticed that he hesitated at first and only
    contributed half a crown. But then it was a case of a man being taken from
    the shed by the police for wife desertion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s always that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;Those
    soft, good-hearted fellows always end by getting hard and selfish. The world
    makes  &rsquo;em so. It&rsquo;s the thought of the soft fools they&rsquo;ve
    been that finds out sooner or later and makes &rsquo;em repent. Like as not
    the Giraffe will be the meanest man out back before he&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When Big Billabong cut out, and we got back to Bourke with our dusty swags
    and dirty cheques, I spoke to Tom Hall:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Tom,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;That long fool, the Giraffe,
    has been breaking his heart for a little girl in Bendigo ever since he&rsquo;s
    been out back, and she&rsquo;s been breaking her heart for him, and the ass
    didn&rsquo;t know it till he got a letter from her just before Big Billabong
    started. He&rsquo;s going to-morrow morning. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>That evening Tom stole the Giraffe&rsquo;s hat. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;ll
    turn up in the mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the Giraffe. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    mind a lark,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but it does seem a bit red hot for the
    chaps to collar a cove&rsquo;s hat and a feller goin&rsquo;  away for good,
    p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps, in the mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell started the thing going with a quid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s worth it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to get rid of him. We&rsquo;ll
    have some peace now. There won&rsquo;t be so many accidents or women in trouble
    when the Giraffe and his blessed hat are gone. Anyway, he&rsquo;s an eyesore
    in the town, and he&rsquo;s getting on my nerves for one. . . . Come on,
    you sinners! Chuck &rsquo;em in; we&rsquo;re only taking quids and half-quids.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>About daylight next morning Tom Hall slipped into the Giraffe&rsquo;s room
    at the Carriers&rsquo; Arms. The Giraffe was sleeping peacefully. Tom put
    the hat on a chair by his side. The collection had been a record one, and,
    besides the packet of money in the crown of the hat, there was a silver-mounted
    pipe with case&mdash;the best that could be bought in Bourke, a gold brooch,
    and several trifles&mdash;besides an ugly valentine of a long man in his
    shirt walking the room with a twin on each arm.</p>
  <p>Tom was about to shake the Giraffe by the shoulder, when he noticed a great
    foot, with about half a yard of big-boned ankle and shank, sticking out at
    the bottom of the bed. The temptation was too great. Tom took up the hair-brush,
    and, with the back of it, he gave a smart rap on the point of an in-growing
    toe-nail, and slithered.</p>
  <p>We heard the Giraffe swearing good-naturedly for a while, and then there
    was a pregnant silence. He was staring at the hat we supposed.</p>
  <p>We were all up at the station to see him off. It was rather a long wait.
    The Giraffe edged me up to the other end of the platform.</p>
  <p>He seemed overcome.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s&mdash;there&rsquo;s some terrible good-hearted fellers
    in this world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t forgit &rsquo;em,
    Harry, when you make a big name writin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m
    blessed if I don&rsquo;t feel as if I was jist goin&rsquo; to blubber!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I was glad he didn&rsquo;t. The Giraffe blubberin&rsquo; would have been
    a spectacle. I steered him back to his friends.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to kiss me, Bob?&rdquo; said the Great Western&rsquo;s
    big, handsome barmaid, as the bell rang.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t mind kissin&rsquo; you, Alice,&rdquo; he said,
    wiping his mouth. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to be married, yer know.&rdquo; And
    he kissed her fair on the mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; like gettin&rsquo; into practice,&rdquo; he
    said, grinning round.</p>
  <p>We thought he was improving wonderfully; but at the last moment something
    troubled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, you chaps,&rdquo; he said, hesitatingly, with his hand
    in his pocket, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m going to do with
    all this stuff. There&rsquo;s that there poor washerwoman that scalded her
    legs liftin&rsquo; the boiler of clothes off the fire&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We shoved him into the carriage. He hung&mdash;about half of him&mdash;out
    the window, wildly waving his hat, till the train disappeared in the scrub.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>And, as I sit here writing by lamplight at midday, in the midst of a great
    city of shallow social sham, of hopeless, squalid poverty, of ignorant selfishness,
    cultured or brutish, and of noble and heroic endeavour frowned down or callously
    neglected, I am almost aware of a burst of sunshine in the room, and a long
    form leaning over my chair, and:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Excuse me for troublin&rsquo; yer; I&rsquo;m always troublin&rsquo; yer;
    but there&rsquo;s that there poor woman. . . .&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And I wish I could immortalize him!</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThatPrettyGirlintheArmy"></a>That Pretty Girl
      in the Army</b></h2>
  <p class="note">Now I often sit at Watty&rsquo;s, when the night is very near,<br>
    With a head that&rsquo;s full of jingles&mdash;and the fumes of bottled beer;<br>
    For I always have a fancy that, if I am over there<br>
    When the Army prays for Watty, I&rsquo;m included in the prayer.<br>
    It would take a lot of praying, lots of thumping on the drum,<br>
    To prepare our sinful, straying, erring souls for Kingdom Come.<br>
    But I love my fellow-sinners! and I hope, upon the whole,<br>
    That the Army gets a hearing when it prays for Watty&rsquo;s soul.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From - <i>When the World
  was Wide.</i></p>
  <p>The&nbsp;Salvation Army does good business in some of the outback towns
    of the great pastoral wastes of Australia. There&rsquo;s the thoughtless,
    careless generosity of the bushman, whose pockets don&rsquo;t go far enough
    down his trousers (that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with him), and who
    contributes to anything that comes along, without troubling to ask questions,
    like long Bob Brothers of Bourke, who, chancing to be &ldquo;a Protestant
    by rights,&rdquo; unwittingly subscribed towards the erection of a new Catholic
    church, and, being chaffed for his mistake, said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, I don&rsquo;t suppose it&rsquo;ll matter a hang in the
    end, anyway it goes. I ain&rsquo;t got nothink agenst the Roming Carflicks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the shearer, fresh with his cheque from a cut-out shed, gloriously
    drunk and happy, in love with all the world, and ready to subscribe towards
    any creed and shout for all hands&mdash;including Old Nick if he happened
    to come along. There&rsquo;s the shearer, half-drunk and inclined to be nasty,
    who has got the wrong end of all things with a tight grip, and who flings
    a shilling in the face of out-back conventionality (as he thinks) by chucking
    a bob into the Salvation Army ring. Then he glares round to see if he can
    catch anybody winking behind his back. There&rsquo;s the cynical joker, a
    queer mixture, who contributes generously and tempts the reformed boozer
    afterwards. There&rsquo;s the severe-faced old station-hand&mdash;in clean
    shirt and neckerchief and white moleskins&mdash;in for his annual or semiannual
    spree, who contributes on principle, and then drinks religiously until his
    cheque is gone and the horrors are come. There&rsquo;s the shearer, feeling
    mighty bad after a spree, and in danger of seeing things when he tries to
    go to sleep. He has dropped ten or twenty pounds over bar counters and at
    cards, and he now &ldquo;chucks&rdquo; a repentant shilling into the ring,
    with a very private and rather vague sort of feeling that something might
    come of it. There&rsquo;s the stout, contented, good-natured publican, who
    tips the Army as if it were a barrel-organ. And there are others and other
    reasons&mdash;black sheep and ne&rsquo;er-do-weels&mdash;and faint echoes
    of other times in Salvation Army tunes.</p>
  <p>Bourke, the metropolis of the Great Scrubs, on the banks of the Darling
    River, about five hundred miles from Sydney, was suffering from a long drought
    when I was there in ninety-two; and the heat may or may not have been another
    cause contributing to the success, from a business point of view, of the
    Bourke garrison. There was much beer boozing&mdash;and, besides, it was vaguely
    understood (as most things are vaguely understood out there in the drought-haze)
    that the place the Army came to save us from was hotter than Bourke. We didn&rsquo;t
    hanker to go to a hotter place than Bourke. But that year there was an extraordinary
    reason for the Army&rsquo;s great financial success there.</p>
  <p>She was a little girl, nineteen or twenty, I should judge, the prettiest
    girl I ever saw in the Army, and one of the prettiest I&rsquo;ve ever seen
    out of it. She had the features of an angel, but her expression was wonderfully
    human, sweet and sympathetic. Her big grey eyes were sad with sympathy for
    sufferers and sinners, and her poke bonnet was full of bunchy, red-gold hair.
    Her first appearance was somewhat dramatic&mdash;perhaps the Army arranged
    it so.</p>
  <p>The Army used to pray, and thump the drum, and sing, and take up collections
    every evening outside Watty Bothways&rsquo; Hotel, the Carriers&rsquo; Arms.
    They performed longer and more often outside Watty&rsquo;s than any other
    pub in town&mdash;perhaps because Watty was considered the most hopeless
    publican and his customers the hardest crowd of boozers in Bourke. The band
    generally began to play about dusk. Watty would lean back comfortably in
    a basket easy-chair on his wide veranda, and clasp his hands, in a calm,
    contented way, while the Army banged the drum and got steam up, and whilst,
    perhaps, there was a barney going on in the bar, or a bloodthirsty fight
    in the backyard. On such occasions there was something like an indulgent
    or fatherly expression on his fat and usually emotionless face. And by and
    by he&rsquo;d move his head gently and doze. The banging and the singing
    seemed to soothe him, and the praying, which was often very personal, never
    seemed to disturb him in the least.</p>
  <p>Well, it was about dusk one day; it had been a terrible day, a hundred and
    something startling in the shade, but there came a breeze after sunset. There
    had been several dozen of buckets of water thrown on the veranda floor and
    the ground outside. Watty was seated in his accustomed place when the Army
    arrived. There was no barney in the bar because there was a fight in the
    backyard, and that claimed the attention of all the customers.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed for Watty and his clients; then a reformed drunkard started
    to testify against publicans and all their works. Watty settled himself comfortably,
    folded his hands, and leaned back and dozed.</p>
  <p>The fight was over, and the chaps began to drop round to the bar. The man
    who was saved waved his arms, and danced round and howled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es!&rdquo; he shouted hoarsely. &ldquo;The publicans, and boozers,
    and gamblers, and sinners may think that Bourke is hot, but hell is a thousand
    times hotter! I tell you &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord!&rdquo; said Mitchell, the shearer, and he threw a penny
    into the ring.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ye-es! I tell you that hell is a million times hotter than Bourke!
    I tell you &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, look here,&rdquo; said a voice from the background, &ldquo;that
    won&rsquo;t wash. Why, don&rsquo;t you know that when the Bourke people die
    they send back for their blankets?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The saved brother glared round.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I hear a freethinker speaking, my friends,&rdquo; he said. Then,
    with sudden inspiration and renewed energy, &ldquo;I hear the voice of a
    freethinker. Show me the face of a freethinker,&rdquo; he yelled, glaring
    round like a hunted, hungry man. &ldquo;Show me the face of a freethinker,
    and I&rsquo;ll tell you what he is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Watty hitched himself into a more comfortable position and clasped his hands
    on his knee and closed his eyes again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ya-a-a-s!&rdquo; shrieked the brand. &ldquo;I tell you, my friends,
    I can tell a freethinker by his face. Show me the face of a&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At this point there was an interruption. One-eyed, or Wall-eyed, Bogan,
    who had a broken nose, and the best side of whose face was reckoned the ugliest
    and most sinister&mdash;One-eyed Bogan thrust his face forward from the ring
    of darkness into the torchlight of salvation. He had got the worst of a drawn
    battle; his nose and mouth were bleeding, and his good eye was damaged.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look at my face!&rdquo; he snarled, with dangerous earnestness. &ldquo;Look
    at my face! That&rsquo;s the face of a freethinker, and I don&rsquo;t care
    who knows it. Now! what have you got to say against my face, &lsquo;Man-without-a-Shirt?&rsquo; &ldquo;</p>
  <p>The brother drew back. He had been known in the northwest in his sinful
    days as &ldquo;Man-without-a-Shirt,&rdquo;&nbsp;<i>alias</i>&nbsp;&ldquo;Shirty,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The
    Dirty Man,&rdquo; and was flabbergasted at being recognized in speech. Also,
    he had been in a shearing-shed and in a shanty orgie with One-eyed Bogan,
    and knew the man.</p>
  <p>Now most of the chaps respected the Army, and, indeed, anything that looked
    like religion, but the Bogan&rsquo;s face, as representing free-thought,
    was a bit too sudden for them. There were sounds on the opposite side of
    the ring as from men being smitten repeatedly and rapidly below the belt,
    and long Tom Hall and one or two others got away into the darkness in the
    background, where Tom rolled helplessly on the grass and sobbed.</p>
  <p>It struck me that Bogan&rsquo;s face was more the result of free speech
    than anything else.</p>
  <p>The Army was about to pray when the Pretty Girl stepped forward, her eyes
    shining with indignation and enthusiasm. She had arrived by the evening train,
    and had been standing shrinkingly behind an Army lass of fifty Australian
    summers, who was about six feet high, flat and broad, and had a square face,
    and a mouth like a joint in boiler plates.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl stamped her pretty foot on the gravel, and her eyes flashed
    in the torchlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of yourselves,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Great
    big men like you to be going on the way you are. If you were ignorant or
    poor, as I&rsquo;ve seen people, there might be some excuse for you. Haven&rsquo;t
    you got any mothers, or sisters, or wives to think of? What sort of a life
    is this you lead? Drinking, and gambling, and fighting, and swearing your
    lives away! Do you ever think of God and the time when you were children?
    Why don&rsquo;t you make homes? Look at that man&rsquo;s face!&rdquo; (she
    pointed suddenly at Bogan, who collapsed and sidled behind his mates out
    of the light). &ldquo;Look at that man&rsquo;s face! Is it a face for a Christian?
    And you help and encourage him to fight. You&rsquo;re worse than he is. Oh,
    it&rsquo;s brutal. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s wicked. Great big men like
    you, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Long Bob Brothers&mdash;about six-foot-four&mdash;the longest and most innocent
    there, shrunk down by the wall and got his inquiring face out of the light.
    The Pretty Girl fluttered on for a few moments longer, greatly excited, and
    then stepped back, seemingly much upset, and was taken under the wing of
    the woman with the boiler-plate mouth.</p>
  <p>It was a surprise, and very sudden. Bogan slipped round to the backyard,
    and was seen bathing his battered features at the pump. The rest wore the
    expression of men who knew that something unusual has happened, but don&rsquo;t
    know what, and are waiting vacantly for developments.&mdash;Except Tom Hall,
    who had recovered and returned. He stood looking over the head of the ring
    of bushmen, and apparently taking the same critical interest in the girl
    as he would in a fight&mdash;his expression was such as a journalist might
    wear who is getting exciting copy.</p>
  <p>The Army had it all their own way for the rest of the evening, and made
    a good collection. The Pretty Girl stood smiling round with shining eyes
    as the bobs and tanners dropped in, and then, being shoved forward by the
    flat woman, she thanked us sweetly, and said we were good fellows, and that
    she was sorry for some things she&rsquo;d said to us. Then she retired, fluttering
    and very much flushed, and hid herself behind the hard woman&mdash;who, by
    the way, had an excrescence on her upper lip which might have stood for a
    rivet.</p>
  <p>Presently the Pretty Girl came from behind the big woman and stood watching
    things with glistening eyes. Some of the chaps on the opposite side of the
    ring moved a little to one side and all were careful not to meet her eye&mdash;not
    to be caught looking at her&mdash;lest she should be embarrassed. Watty had
    roused himself a little at the sound of a strange voice in the Army (and
    such a clear, sweet voice too!) and had a look; then he settled back peacefully
    again, but it was noticed that he didn&rsquo;t snore that evening.</p>
  <p>And when the Army prayed, the Pretty Girl knelt down with the rest on the
    gravel. One or two tall bushmen bowed their heads as if they had to, and
    One-eyed Bogan, with the blood washed from his face, stood with his hat off,
    glaring round to see if he could catch anyone sniggering.</p>
  <p>Mitchell, the shearer, said afterwards that the whole business made him
    feel for the moment like he felt sometimes in the days when he used to feel
    things.</p>
  <p>The town discussed the Pretty Girl in the Army that night and for many days
    thereafter, but no one could find out who she was or where she belonged to&mdash;except
    that she came from Sydney last. She kept her secret, if she had one, very
    close&mdash;or else the other S.-A. women were not to be pumped. She lived
    in skillion-rooms at the back of the big weather-board Salvation Army barracks
    with two other &ldquo;lassies,&rdquo; who did washing and sewing and nursing,
    and went shabby, and half starved themselves, and were baked in the heat,
    like scores of women in the bush, and even as hundreds of women, suffering
    from religious mania, slave and stint in city slums, and neglect their homes,
    husbands and children&mdash;for the glory of Booth.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was referred to as Sister Hannah by the Army people, and
    came somehow to be known by sinners as &ldquo;Miss Captain.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t
    know whether that was her real name or what rank she held in the Army, if
    indeed she held any.</p>
  <p>She sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>, and the circulation doubled in a day. One-eyed
    Bogan, being bailed up unexpectedly, gave her &ldquo;half a caser&rdquo; for
    a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>, and ran away without the paper or the change. Jack Mitchell
    bought a&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;for the first time in his life, and read it.
    He said he found some of the articles intensely realistic, and many of the
    statements were very interesting. He said he read one or two things in the&nbsp;<i>Cry</i>&nbsp;that
    he didn&rsquo;t know before. Tom Hall, taken unawares, bought three&nbsp;<i>Crys</i>&nbsp;from
    the Pretty Girl, and blushed to find it fame.</p>
  <p>Little Billy Woods, the Labourers&rsquo; Union secretary&mdash;who had a
    poetic temperament and more than the average bushman&rsquo;s reverence for
    higher things&mdash;Little Billy Woods told me in a burst of confidence that
    he generally had two feelings, one after the other, after encountering that
    girl. One was that unfathomable far-away feeling of loneliness and longing,
    that comes at odd times to the best of married men, with the best of wives
    and children&mdash;as Billy had. The other feeling, which came later on,
    and was a reaction in fact, was the feeling of a man who thinks he&rsquo;s
    been twisted round a woman&rsquo;s little finger for the benefit of somebody
    else. Billy said that he couldn&rsquo;t help being reminded by the shy, sweet
    smile and the shy, sweet &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; of the Pretty Girl in the
    Army, of the shy, sweet smile and the shy, sweet gratitude of a Sydney private
    barmaid, who had once roped him in, in the days before he was married. Then
    he&rsquo;d reckon that the Army lassie had been sent out back to Bourke as
    a business speculation.</p>
  <p>Tom Hall was inclined to reckon so too&mdash;but that was after he&rsquo;d
    been chaffed for a month about the three&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl was discussed from psychological points of view; not forgetting
    the sex problem. Donald Macdonald&mdash;shearer, union leader and labour
    delegate to other colonies on occasion&mdash;Donald Macdonald said that whenever
    he saw a circle of plain or ugly, dried-up women or girls round a shepherd,
    evangelist or a Salvation Army drum, he&rsquo;d say &ldquo;sexually starved!&rdquo;  They
    were hungry for love. Religious mania was sexual passion dammed out of its
    course. Therefore he held that morbidly religious girls were the most easily
    seduced.</p>
  <p>But this couldn&rsquo;t apply to Pretty Girl in the Army. Mitchell reckoned
    that she&rsquo;d either had a great sorrow&mdash;a lot of trouble, or a disappointment
    in love (the &ldquo;or&rdquo; is Mitchell&rsquo;s); but they couldn&rsquo;t
    see how a girl like her could possibly be disappointed in love&mdash;unless
    the chap died or got into jail for life. Donald decided that her soul had
    been starved somehow.</p>
  <p>Mitchell suggested that it might be only a craving for notoriety, the same
    thing that makes women and girls go amongst lepers, and out to the battlefield,
    and nurse ugly pieces of men back to life again; the same thing that makes
    some women and girls swear ropes round men&rsquo;s necks. The Pretty Girl
    might be the daughter of well-to-do people&mdash;even aristocrats, said Mitchell&mdash;she
    was pretty enough and spoke well enough. &ldquo;Every woman&rsquo;s a barmaid
    at heart,&rdquo; as the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;puts it, said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>But not even one of the haggard women of Bourke ever breathed a suspicion
    of scandal against her. They said she was too good and too pretty to be where
    she was. You see it was not as in an old settled town where hags blacken
    God&rsquo;s world with their tongues. Bourke was just a little camping town
    in a big land, where free, good-hearted democratic Australians, and the best
    of black sheep from the old world were constantly passing through; where
    husband&rsquo;s were often obliged to be away from home for twelve months,
    and the storekeepers had to trust the people, and mates trusted each other,
    and the folks were broad-minded. The mind&rsquo;s eye had a wide range.</p>
  <p>After her maiden speech the Pretty Girl seldom spoke, except to return thanks
    for collections&mdash;and she never testified. She had a sweet voice and
    used to sing.</p>
  <p>Now, if I were writing pure fiction, and were not cursed with an obstinate
    inclination to write the truth, I might say that, after the advent of the
    Pretty Girl, the morals of Bourke improved suddenly and wonderfully. That
    One-eyed Bogan left off gambling and drinking and fighting and swearing,
    and put on a red coat and testified and fought the devil only; that Mitchell
    dropped his mask of cynicism; that Donald Macdonald ate no longer of the
    tree of knowledge and ceased to worry himself with psychological problems,
    and was happy; and that Tom Hall was no longer a scoffer. That no one sneaked
    round through the scrub after dusk to certain necessary establishments in
    weather-board cottages on the outskirts of the town; and that the broad-minded
    and obliging ladies thereof became Salvation Army lassies.</p>
  <p>But none of these things happened. Drunks quieted down or got out of the
    way if they could when the Pretty Girl appeared on the scene, fights and
    games of &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; were adjourned, and weak,
    ordinary language was used for the time being, and that was about all.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, most of the chaps were in love with that Pretty Girl in the
    Army&mdash;all those who didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<i>worship</i>&nbsp;her privately.
    Long Bob Brothers hovered round in hopes, they said, that she&rsquo;d meet
    with an accident&mdash;get run over by a horse or something&mdash;and he&rsquo;d
    have to carry her in; he scared the women at the barracks by dropping firewood
    over the fence after dark. Barcoo-Rot, the meanest man in the back country,
    was seen to drop a threepenny bit into the ring, and a rumour was industriously
    circulated (by Tom Hall) to the effect that One-eyed Bogan intended to shave
    and join the Army disguised as a lassie.</p>
  <p>Handsome Jake Boreham (<i>alias</i>&nbsp;Bore-&rsquo;em), a sentimental
    shearer from New Zealand, who had read Bret Harte, made an elaborate attempt
    for the Pretty Girl, by pretending to be going to the dogs headlong, with
    an idea of first winning her sorrowful interest and sympathy, and then making
    an apparently hard struggle to straighten up for her sake. He mated his experience
    with the cheerful and refreshing absence of reserve which was characteristic
    of him, and is of most bushmen.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d had a few drinks,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and was having
    a spell under a gum by the river, when I saw the Pretty Girl and another
    Army woman coming down along the bank. It was a blazing hot day. I thought
    of Sandy and the Schoolmistress in Bret Harte, and I thought it would be
    a good idea to stretch out in the sun and pretend to be helpless; so I threw
    my hat on the ground and lay down, with my head in the blazing heat, in the
    most graceful position I could get at, and I tried to put a look of pained
    regret on my face, as if I was dreaming of my lost boyhood and me mother.
    I thought, perhaps, the Girl would pity me, and I felt sure she&rsquo;d stoop
    and pick up my hat and put it gently over my poor troubled head. Then I was
    going to become conscious for a moment, and look hopelessly round, and into
    her eyes, and then start and look sorrowful and ashamed, and stagger to my
    feet, taking off my hat like the Silver King does to the audience when he
    makes his first appearance drunk on the stage; and then I was going to reel
    off, trying to walk as straight as I could. And next day I was going to clean
    up my teeth and nails and put on a white shirt, and start to be a new man
    henceforth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, as I lay there with my eyes shut, I heard the footsteps come
    up and stop, and heard &rsquo;em whisper, and I thought I heard the Pretty
    Girl say  &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; or something that sounded like that;
    and just then I got a God-almighty poke in the ribs with an umbrella&mdash;at
    least I suppose it was aimed for my ribs; but women are bad shots, and the
    point of the umbrella caught me in the side, just between the bottom rib
    and the hip-bone, and I sat up with a click, like the blade of a pocketknife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The other lassie was the big square-faced woman. The Pretty Girl
    looked rather more frightened and disgusted than sentimental, but she had
    plenty of pluck, and soon pulled herself together. She said I ought to be
    ashamed of myself, a great big man like me, lying there in the dust like
    a drunken tramp&mdash;an eyesore and a disgrace to all the world. She told
    me to go to my camp, wherever that was, and sleep myself sober. The square-jawed
    woman said I looked like a fool sitting there. I did feel ashamed, and I
    reckon I did look like a fool&mdash;a man generally does in a fix like that.
    I felt like one, anyway. I got up and walked away, and it hurt me so much
    that I went over to West Bourke and went to the dogs properly for a fortnight,
    and lost twenty quid on a game of draughts against a blindfold player. Now
    both those women had umbrellas, but I&rsquo;m not sure to this day which
    of &rsquo;em it was that gave me the poke. It wouldn&rsquo;t have mattered
    much anyway. I haven&rsquo;t borrowed one of Bret Harte&rsquo;s books since.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jake reflected a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The worst of it was,&rdquo; he said ruefully, &ldquo;that I wasn&rsquo;t
    sure that the girl or the woman didn&rsquo;t see through me, and that worried
    me a bit. You never can tell how much a woman suspects, and that&rsquo;s
    the worst of &rsquo;em. I found that out after I got married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl in the Army grew pale and thin and bigger-eyed. The women
    said it was a shame, and that she ought to be sent home to her friends, wherever
    they were. She was laid up for two or three days, and some of the women cooked
    delicacies and handed &rsquo;em over the barracks fence, and offered to come
    in and nurse her; but the square woman took washing home and nursed the girl
    herself.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl still sold&nbsp;<i>War Crys</i>&nbsp;and took up collections,
    but in a tired, listless, half shamed-faced way. It was plain that she was
    tired of the Army, and growing ashamed of the Salvationists. Perhaps she
    had come to see things too plainly.</p>
  <p>You see, the Army does no good out back in Australia&mdash;except from a
    business point of view. It is simply there to collect funds for hungry headquarters.
    The bushmen are much too intelligent for the Army. There was no poverty in
    Bourke&mdash;as it is understood in the city; there was plenty of food; and
    camping out and roughing it come natural to the bushmen. In cases of sickness,
    accident, widows or orphans, the chaps sent round the hat, without banging
    a drum or testifying, and that was all right. If a chap was hard up he borrowed
    a couple of quid from his mate. If a strange family arrived without a penny,
    someone had to fix &rsquo;em up, and the storekeepers helped them till the
    man got work. For the rest, we work out our own salvation, or damnation&mdash;as
    the case is&mdash;in the bush, with no one to help us, except a mate, perhaps.
    The Army can&rsquo;t help us, but a fellow-sinner can, sometimes, who has
    been through it all himself. The Army is only a drag on the progress of Democracy,
    because it attracts many who would otherwise be aggressive Democrats&mdash;and
    for other reasons.</p>
  <p>Besides, if we all reformed the Army would get deuced little from us for
    its city mission.</p>
  <p>The Pretty Girl went to service for a while with the stock inspector&rsquo;s
    wife, who could get nothing out of her concerning herself or her friends.
    She still slept at the barracks, stuck to the Army, and attended its meetings.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It was Christmas morning, and there was peace in Bourke and goodwill towards
    all men. There hadn&rsquo;t been a fight since yesterday evening, and that
    had only been a friendly one, to settle an argument concerning the past ownership,
    and, at the same time, to decide as to the future possession of a dog.</p>
  <p>It had been a hot, close night, and it ended in a suffocating sunrise. The
    free portion of the male population were in the habit of taking their blankets
    and sleeping out in &ldquo;the Park,&rdquo; or town square, in hot weather;
    the wives and daughters of the town slept, or tried to sleep, with bedroom
    windows and doors open, while husbands lay outside on the verandas. I camped
    in a corner of the park that night, and the sun woke me.</p>
  <p>As I sat up I caught sight of a swagman coming along the white, dusty road
    from the direction of the bridge, where the cleared road ran across west
    and on, a hundred and thirty miles, through the barren, broiling mulga scrubs,
    to Hungerford, on the border of Sheol. I knew that swagman&rsquo;s walk.
    It was John Merrick (Jack Moonlight), one-time Shearers&rsquo; Union secretary
    at Coonamble, and generally &ldquo;Rep&rdquo; (shearers&rsquo; representative)
    in any shed where he sheared. He was a &ldquo;better-class shearer,&rdquo; one
    of those quiet, thoughtful men of whom there are generally two or three in
    the roughest of rough sheds, who have great influence, and give the shed
    a good name from a Union point of view. Not quiet with the resentful or snobbish
    reserve of the educated Englishman, but with a sad or subdued sort of quietness
    that has force in it&mdash;as if they fully realized that their intelligence
    is much higher than the average, that they have suffered more real trouble
    and heartbreak than the majority of their mates, and that their mates couldn&rsquo;t
    possibly understand them if they spoke as they felt and couldn&rsquo;t see
    things as they do&mdash;yet men who understand and are intensely sympathetic
    in their loneliness and sensitive reserve.</p>
  <p>I had worked in a shed with Jack Moonlight, and had met him in Sydney, and
    to be mates with a bushman for a few weeks is to know him well&mdash;anyway,
    I found it so. He had taken a trip to Sydney the Christmas before last, and
    when he came back there was something wanting. He became more silent, he
    drank more, and sometimes alone, and took to smoking heavily. He dropped
    his mates, took little or no interest in Union matters, and travelled alone,
    and at night.</p>
  <p>The Australian bushman is born with a mate who sticks to him through life&mdash;like
    a mole. They may be hundreds of miles apart sometimes, and separated for
    years, yet they are mates for life. A bushman may have many mates in his
    roving, but there is always one&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;mate, &ldquo;my mate;&rdquo;  and
    it is common to hear a bushman, who is, in every way, a true mate to the
    man he happens to be travelling with, speak of&nbsp;<i>his mate&rsquo;s mate</i>&mdash;&ldquo;Jack&rsquo;s
    mate&rdquo;&mdash;who might be in Klondyke or South Africa. A bushman has
    always a mate to comfort him and argue with him, and work and tramp and drink
    with him, and lend him quids when he&rsquo;s hard up, and call him a b&mdash;&mdash; fool,
    and fight him sometimes; to abuse him to his face and defend his name behind
    his back; to bear false witness and perjure his soul for his sake; to lie
    to the girl for him if he&rsquo;s single, and to his wife if he&rsquo;s married;
    to secure a &ldquo;pen&rdquo; for him at a shed where he isn&rsquo;t on the
    spot, or, if the mate is away in New Zealand or South Africa, to write and
    tell him if it&rsquo;s any good coming over this way. And each would take
    the word of the other against all the world, and each believes that the other
    is the straightest chap that ever lived&mdash;&ldquo;a white man!&rdquo; And
    next best to your old mate is the man you&rsquo;re tramping, riding, working,
    or drinking with.</p>
  <p>About the first thing the cook asks you when you come along to a shearers&rsquo; hut
    is, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your mate?&rdquo; I travelled alone for a while
    one time, and it seemed to me sometimes, by the tone of the inquiry concerning
    the whereabouts of my mate, that the bush had an idea that I might have done
    away with him and that the thing ought to be looked into.</p>
  <p>When a man drops mateship altogether and takes to &ldquo;hatting&rdquo; in
    the bush, it&rsquo;s a step towards a convenient tree and a couple of saddle-straps
    buckled together.</p>
  <p>I had an idea that I, in a measure, took the place of Jack Moonlight&rsquo;s
    mate about this time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jack!&rdquo; I hailed as he reached the corner of the
    park.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good morning, Harry!&rdquo; said Jack, as if he&rsquo;d seen me last
    yesterday evening instead of three months ago. &ldquo;How are you getting
    on?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We walked together towards the Union Office, where I had a camp in the skillion-room
    at the back. Jack was silent. But there&rsquo;s no place in the world where
    a man&rsquo;s silence is respected so much (within reasonable bounds) as
    in the Australian bush, where every man has a past more or less sad, and
    every man a ghost&mdash;perhaps from other lands that we know nothing of,
    and speaking in a foreign tongue. They say in the bush, &ldquo;Oh, Jack&rsquo;s
    only thinking! &ldquo; And they let him think. Generally you want to think
    as much as your mate; and when you&rsquo;ve been together some time it&rsquo;s
    quite natural to travel all day without exchanging a word. In the morning
    Jim says, &ldquo;Well, I think I made a bargain with that horse, Bill,&rdquo; and
    some time late in the afternoon, say twenty miles farther on, it occurs to
    Bill to &ldquo;rejoin,&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, I reckon the blank as sold it
    to you had yer proper!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I like a good thinking mate, and I believe that thinking in company is a
    lot more healthy and more comfortable, as well as less risky, than thinking
    alone.</p>
  <p>On the way to the Union Office Jack and I passed the Royal Hotel, and caught
    a glimpse, through the open door, of a bed room off the veranda, of the landlord&rsquo;s
    fresh, fair, young Sydney girl-wife, sleeping prettily behind the mosquito-net,
    like a sleeping beauty, while the boss lay on a mattress outside on the veranda,
    across the open door. (He wasn&rsquo;t necessary for publication, but an
    evidence of good faith.)</p>
  <p>I glanced at Jack for a grin, but didn&rsquo;t get one. He wore the pained
    expression of a man who is suddenly hit hard with the thought of something
    that might have been.</p>
  <p>I boiled the billy and fried a pound of steak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Been travelling all night, Jack?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;I camped at Emus yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He didn&rsquo;t eat. I began to reckon that he was brooding too much for
    his health. He was much thinner than when I saw him last, and pretty haggard,
    and he had something of the hopeless, haggard look that I&rsquo;d seen in
    Tom Hall&rsquo;s eyes after the last big shearing strike, when Tom had worked
    day and night to hold his mates up all through the hard, bitter struggle,
    and the battle was lost.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Jack!&rdquo; I said at last. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s up, Harry,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;What made you
    think so?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you got yourself into any fix?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
    the Hungerford track been doing to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right. How are you?&rdquo; And
    he pulled some string and papers and a roll of dusty pound notes from his
    pocket and threw them on the bunk.</p>
  <p>I was hard up just then, so I took a note and the billy to go to the Royal
    and get some beer. I thought the beer might loosen his mind a bit.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Better take a couple of quid,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;You look as
    if you want some new shirts and things.&rdquo; But a pound was enough for
    me, and I think he had reason to be glad of that later on, as it turned out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything new in Bourke?&rdquo; asked Jack as we drank the beer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;not a thing&mdash;except there&rsquo;s
    a pretty girl in the Salvation Army.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And it&rsquo;s about time,&rdquo; growled Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, Jack,&rdquo; I said presently, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s
    come over you lately at all? I might be able to help you. It&rsquo;s not
    a bit of use telling me that there&rsquo;s nothing the matter. When a man
    takes to brooding and travelling alone it&rsquo;s a bad sign, and it will
    end in a leaning tree and a bit of clothes-line as likely as not. Tell me
    what the trouble is. Tell us all about it. There&rsquo;s a ghost, isn&rsquo;t
    there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Jack. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got
    our ghosts for that matter. But never you mind, Harry; I&rsquo;m all right.
    I don&rsquo;t go interfering with your ghosts, and I don&rsquo;t see what
    call you&rsquo;ve got to come haunting mine. Why, it&rsquo;s as bad as kicking
    a man&rsquo;s dog.&rdquo; And he gave the ghost of a grin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me, Jack,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is it a woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Jack, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a woman. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it a girl?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>So there was no more to be said. I&rsquo;d thought it might have been a
    lot worse than a girl. I&rsquo;d thought he might have got married somewhere,
    sometime, and made a mess of it.</p>
  <p>We had dinner at Billy Woods&rsquo;s place, and a sensible Christmas dinner
    it was&mdash;everything cold, except the vegetables, with the hose going
    on the veranda in spite of the by-laws, and Billy&rsquo;s wife and her sister,
    fresh and cool-looking and jolly, instead of being hot and brown and cross
    like most Australian women who roast themselves over a blazing fire in a
    hot kitchen on a broiling day, all the morning, to cook scalding plum pudding
    and redhot roasts, for no other reason than that their grandmothers used
    to cook hot Christmas dinners in England.</p>
  <p>And in the afternoon we went for a row on the river, pulling easily up the
    anabranch and floating down with the stream under the shade of the river
    timber&mdash;instead of going to sleep and waking up helpless and soaked
    in perspiration, to find the women with headaches, as many do on Christmas
    Day in Australia.</p>
  <p>Mrs Woods tried to draw Jack out, but it was no use, and in the evening
    he commenced drinking, and that made Billy uneasy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid
    Jack&rsquo;s on the wrong track,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>After tea most of us collected about Watty&rsquo;s veranda. Most things
    that happened in Bourke happened at Watty&rsquo;s pub, or near it.</p>
  <p>If a horse bolted with a buggy or cart, he was generally stopped outside
    Watty&rsquo;s, which seemed to suggest, as Mitchell said, that most of the
    heroes drank at Watty&rsquo;s&mdash;also that the pluckiest men were found
    amongst the hardest drinkers. (But sometimes the horse fetched up against
    Watty&rsquo;s sign and lamppost&mdash;which was a stout one of &ldquo;iron-bark&rdquo;&mdash;and
    smashed the trap.) Then Watty&rsquo;s was the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, a union
    pub; and Australian teamsters are mostly hard cases: while there was something
    in Watty&rsquo;s beer which made men argue fluently, and the best fights
    came off in his backyard. Watty&rsquo;s dogs were the most quarrelsome in
    town, and there was a dog-fight there every other evening, followed as often
    as not by a man-fight. If a bushman&rsquo;s horse ran away with him the chances
    were that he&rsquo;d be thrown on to Watty&rsquo;s veranda, if he wasn&rsquo;t
    pitched into the bar; and victims of accidents, and sick, hard-up shearers,
    were generally carried to Watty&rsquo;s pub, as being the most convenient
    and comfortable for them. Mitchell denied that it was generosity or good
    nature on Watty&rsquo;s part, he said it was all business&mdash;advertisement.
    Watty knew what he was doing. He was very deep, was Watty. Mitchell further
    hinted that if&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;was sick he wouldn&rsquo;t be carried
    to Watty&rsquo;s, for Watty knew what a thirsty business a funeral was. Tom
    Hall reckoned that Watty bribed the Army on the quiet.</p>
  <p>I was sitting on a stool along the veranda wall with Donald Macdonald, Bob
    Brothers (the Giraffe) and Mitchell, and one or two others, and Jack Moonlight
    sat on the floor with his back to the wall and his hat well down over his
    eyes. The Army came along at the usual time, but we didn&rsquo;t see the
    Pretty Girl at first&mdash;she was a bit late. Mitchell said he liked to
    be at Watty&rsquo;s when the Army prayed and the Pretty Girl was there; he
    had no objection to being prayed for by a girl like that, though he reckoned
    that nothing short of a real angel could save him now. He said his old grandmother
    used to pray for him every night of her life and three times on Sunday, with
    Christmas Day extra when Christmas Day didn&rsquo;t fall on a Sunday; but
    Mitchell reckoned that the old lady couldn&rsquo;t have had much influence
    because he became more sinful every year, and went deeper in ways of darkness,
    until finally he embarked on a career of crime.</p>
  <p>The Army prayed, and then a thin &ldquo;ratty&rdquo; little woman bobbed
    up in the ring; she&rsquo;d gone mad on religion as women do on woman&rsquo;s
    rights and hundreds of other things. She was so skinny in the face, her jaws
    so prominent, and her mouth so wide, that when she opened it to speak it
    was like a ventriloquist&rsquo;s dummy and you could almost see the cracks
    open down under her ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They say I&rsquo;m cracked!&rdquo; she screamed in a shrill, cracked
    voice.  &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not cracked&mdash;I&rsquo;m only cracked on
    the Lord Jesus Christ! That&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m cracked on.&rdquo; And
    just then the Amen man of the Army&mdash;the Army groaner we called him,
    who was always putting both feet in it&mdash;just then he blundered forward,
    rolled up his eyes, threw his hands up and down as if he were bouncing two
    balls, and said, with deep feeling:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank the Lord she&rsquo;s got a crack in the right place!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall doubled up, and most of the other sinners seemed to think there
    was something very funny about it. And the Army, too, seemed struck with
    an idea that there was something wrong somewhere, for they started a hymn.</p>
  <p>A big American negro, who&rsquo;d been a night watchman in Sydney, stepped
    into the ring and waved his arms and kept time, and as he got excited he
    moved his hands up and down rapidly, as if he was hauling down a rope in
    a great hurry through a pulley block above, and he kept saying, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord!&rdquo; all through the hymn, like a bass accompaniment, &ldquo;Come
    down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord; come down, Lord!&rdquo; and
    the quicker he said it the faster he hauled. He was as good as a drum. And,
    when the hymn was over, he started to testify.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My frens!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was once black as der coals in
    der mined! I was once black as der ink in der ocean of sin! But now&mdash;thank
    an&rsquo; bless the Lord!&mdash;I am whiter dan der dribben snow!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall sat down on the edge of the veranda and leaned his head against
    a post and cried. He had contributed a bob this evening, and he was getting
    his money&rsquo;s worth.</p>
  <p>Then the Pretty Girl arrived and was pushed forward into the ring. She looked
    thinner and whiter than I&rsquo;d ever seen her, and there was a feverish
    brightness in her eyes that I didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Men!&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is Christmas Day.&rdquo; I didn&rsquo;t
    hear any more for, at the sound of her voice, Jack Moonlight jumped up as
    if he&rsquo;d sat on a baby. He started forward, stared at her for a moment
    as if he couldn&rsquo;t believe his eyes, and then said, &ldquo;Hannah!&rdquo; short
    and sharp. She started as if she was shot, gave him a wild look, and stumbled
    forward; the next moment he had her in his arms and was steering for the
    private parlour.</p>
  <p>I heard Mrs Bothways calling for water and smelling-salts; she was as fat
    as Watty, and very much like him in the face, but she was emotional and sympathetic.
    Then presently I heard, through the open window, the Pretty Girl say to Jack, &ldquo;Oh,
    Jack, Jack! Why did you go away and leave me like that? It was cruel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you told me to go, Hannah,&rdquo; said Jack.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t make any difference. Why didn&rsquo;t
    you write?&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because you never wrote to me, Hannah,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&mdash;that was no excuse!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was so
    k-k-k-cruel of you, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs Bothways pulled down the window. A new-comer asked Watty what the trouble
    was, and he said that the Army girl had only found her chap, or husband,
    or long-lost brother or something, but the missus was looking after the business;
    then he dozed again.</p>
  <p>And then we adjourned to the Royal and took the Army with us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way of it,&rdquo; said Donald Macdonald. &ldquo;With
    a woman it&rsquo;s love or religion; with a man it&rsquo;s love or the devil. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or with a man,&rdquo; said Mitchell, presently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    love and the devil both, sometimes, Donald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked at Mitchell hard, but for all his face expressed he might only
    have said, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s going to rain.&rdquo;</p>

  <p>The&nbsp;Imperial Hotel was rather an unfortunate name for an out-back town
    pub, for out back is the stronghold of Australian democracy; it was the out-back
    vote and influence that brought about &ldquo;One Man One Vote,&rdquo; &ldquo;Payment
    of Members,&rdquo; and most of the democratic legislation of late years,
    and from out back came the overwhelming vote in favour of Australian as Imperial
    Federation.</p>
  <p>The name Royal Hotel is as familiar as that of the Railway Hotel, and passes
    unnoticed and ungrowled at, even by bush republicans. The Royal Hotel at
    Bourke was kept by an Irishman, one O&rsquo;Donohoo, who was Union to the
    backbone, loudly in favour of &ldquo;Australia for the Australians,&rdquo; and,
    of course, against even the democratic New South Wales Government of the
    time. He went round town all one St Patrick&rsquo;s morning with a bunch
    of green ribbon fastened to his coat-tail with a large fish-hook, and wasn&rsquo;t
    aware of the fact till he sat down on the point of it. But that&rsquo;s got
    nothing to do with it.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel at Bourke was unpopular from the first. It was said that
    the very existence of the house was the result of a swindle. It had been
    built with money borrowed on certain allotments in the centre of the town
    and on the understanding that it should be built on the mortgaged land, whereas
    it was erected on a free allotment. Which fact was discovered, greatly to
    its surprise, by the building society when it came to foreclose on the allotments
    some years later. While the building was being erected the Bourke people
    understood, in a vague way, that it was to be a convent (perhaps the building
    society thought so, too), and when certain ornaments in brick and cement
    in the shape of a bishop&rsquo;s mitre were placed over the corners of the
    walls the question seemed decided. But when the place was finished a bar
    was fitted up, and up went the sign, to the disgust of the other publicans,
    who didn&rsquo;t know a licence had been taken out&mdash;for licensing didn&rsquo;t
    go by local option in those days. It was rumoured that the place belonged
    to, and the whole business was engineered by, a priest. And priests are men
    of the world.</p>
  <p>The Imperial Hotel was patronized by the pastoralists, the civil servants,
    the bank manager and clerks&mdash;all the scrub aristocracy; it was the headquarters
    of the Pastoralists&rsquo; Union in Bourke; a barracks for blacklegs brought
    up from Sydney to take the place of Union shearers on strike; and the new
    Governor, on his inevitable visit to Bourke, was banqueted at the Imperial
    Hotel. The editor of the local &ldquo;capitalistic rag&rdquo; stayed there;
    the pastoralists&rsquo; member was elected mostly by dark ways and means
    devised at the Imperial Hotel, and one of its managers had stood as a dummy
    candidate to split the Labour vote; the management of the hotel was his reward.
    In short, it was there that most of the plots were hatched to circumvent
    Freedom, and put away or deliver into the clutches of law and order certain
    sons of Light and Liberty who believed in converting blacklegs into jellies
    by force of fists when bribes, gentle persuasion and pure Australian language
    failed to convert them to clean Unionism. The Imperial Hotel was called the &ldquo;Squatters&rsquo; Pub,&rdquo; the  &ldquo;Scabbery,&rdquo; and
    other and more expressive names.</p>
  <p>The hotel became still more unpopular after Percy Douglas had managed it
    for a while. He was an avowed enemy of Labour Unionists. He employed Chinese
    cooks, and that in the height of the anti-Chinese agitation in Australia,
    and he was known to have kindly feelings towards the Afghans who, with their
    camels, were running white carriers off the roads. If an excited Unionist
    called a man a &ldquo;blackleg&rdquo; or &ldquo;scab&rdquo; in the Imperial
    bar he was run out&mdash;sometimes with great difficulty, and occasionally
    as far as the lock-up.</p>
  <p>Percy Douglas was a fine-looking man, &ldquo;wid a chest on him an&rsquo; well
    hung&mdash;a fine fee-<i>gure</i>&nbsp;of a man,&rdquo; as O&rsquo;Donohoo
    pronounced it. He was tall and erect, he dressed well, wore small side-whiskers,
    had an eagle nose, and looked like an aristocrat. Like many of his type,
    who start sometimes as billiard-markers and suddenly become hotel managers
    in Australia, nothing was known of his past. Jack Mitchell reckoned, by the
    way he treated his employees and spoke to workmen, that he was the educated
    son of an English farmer&mdash;gone wrong and sent out to Australia. Someone
    called him &ldquo;Lord Douglas,&rdquo; and the nickname caught on.</p>
  <p>He made himself well hated. He got One-eyed Bogan &ldquo;three months&rsquo;  hard&rdquo; for
    taking a bottle of whisky off the Imperial bar counter because he (Bogan)
    was drunk and thirsty and had knocked down his cheque, and because there
    was no one minding the bar at the moment.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas dismissed the barmaid, and, as she was leaving, he had her
    boxes searched and gave her in charge for stealing certain articles belonging
    to the hotel. The chaps subscribed to defend the case, and subsequently put
    a few pounds together for the girl. She proved her gratitude by bringing
    a charge of a baby against one of the chaps&mdash;but that was only one of
    the little ways of the world, as Mitchell said. She joined a Chinese camp
    later on.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas employed a carpenter to do some work about the hotel, and because
    the carpenter left before the job was finished, Lord Douglas locked his tools
    in an outhouse and refused to give them up; and when the carpenter, with
    the spirit of an Australian workman, broke the padlock and removed his tool-chest,
    the landlord gave him in charge for breaking and entering. The chaps defended
    the case and won it, and hated Lord Douglas as much as if he were their elder
    brother. Mitchell was the only one to put in a word for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been puzzling it out,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as he sat
    nursing his best leg in the Union Office, &ldquo;and, as far as I can see,
    it all amounts to this&mdash;we&rsquo;re all mistaken in Lord Douglas. We
    don&rsquo;t know the man. He&rsquo;s all right. We don&rsquo;t understand
    him. He&rsquo;s really a sensitive, good-hearted man who&rsquo;s been shoved
    a bit off the track by the world. It&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s fault&mdash;he&rsquo;s
    not to blame. You see, when he was a youngster he was the most good-natured
    kid in the school; he was always soft, and, consequently, he was always being
    imposed upon, and bullied, and knocked about. Whenever he got a penny to
    buy lollies he&rsquo;d count &rsquo;em out carefully and divide &rsquo;em
    round amongst his schoolmates and brothers and sisters. He was the only one
    that worked at home, and consequently they all hated him. His father respected
    him, but didn&rsquo;t love him, because he wasn&rsquo;t a younger son, and
    wasn&rsquo;t bringing his father&rsquo;s grey hairs down in sorrow to the
    grave. If it was in Australia, probably Lord Douglas was an elder son and
    had to do all the hard graft, and teach himself at night, and sleep in a
    bark skillion while his younger brothers benefited&mdash;they were born in
    the new brick house and went to boarding-schools. His mother had a contempt
    for him because he wasn&rsquo;t a black sheep and a prodigal, and, when the
    old man died, the rest of the family got all the stuff and Lord Douglas was
    kicked out because they could do without him now. And the family hated him
    like poison ever afterwards (especially his mother), and spread lies about
    him&mdash;because they had treated him shamefully and because his mouth was
    shut&mdash;they knew he wouldn&rsquo;t speak. Then probably he went in for
    Democracy and worked for Freedom, till Freedom trod on him once too often
    with her hob-nailed boots. Then the chances are, in the end, he was ruined
    by a girl or woman, and driven, against his will, to take refuge in pure
    individualism. He&rsquo;s all right, only we don&rsquo;t appreciate him.
    He&rsquo;s only fighting against his old ideals&mdash;his old self that comes
    up sometimes&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what makes him sweat his barmaids and
    servants, and hate us, and run us in; and perhaps when he cuts up extra rough
    it&rsquo;s because his conscience kicks him when he thinks of the damned
    soft fool he used to be. He&rsquo;s all right&mdash;take my word for it.
    It&rsquo;s all a mask. Why, he might be one of the kindest-hearted men in
    Bourke underneath.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tom Hall rubbed his head and blinked, as if he was worried by an idea that
    there might be some facts in Mitchell&rsquo;s theories.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re allers findin&rsquo; excuses for blacklegs an&rsquo; scabs,
    Mitchell,&rdquo;  said Barcoo-Rot, who took Mitchell seriously (and who would
    have taken a laughing jackass seriously). &ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;d find a
    white spot on a squatter. I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if you blacklegged
    yourself in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This was an unpardonable insult, from a Union point of view, and the chaps
    half-unconsciously made room on the floor for Barcoo-Rot to fall after Jack
    Mitchell hit him. But Mitchell took the insult philosophically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Barcoo-Rot,&rdquo; he said, nursing the other leg, &ldquo;for
    the matter of that, I did find a white spot on a squatter once. He lent me
    a quid when I was hard up. There&rsquo;s white spots on the blackest characters
    if you only drop prejudice and look close enough. I suppose even Jack-the-Ripper&rsquo;s
    character was speckled. Why, I can even see spots on your character, some
    times, Barcoo-Rot. I&rsquo;ve known white spots to spread on chaps&rsquo; characters
    until they were little short of saints. Sometimes I even fancy I can feel
    my own wings sprouting. And as for turning blackleg&mdash;well, I suppose
    I&rsquo;ve got a bit of the crawler in my composition (most of us have),
    and a man never knows what might happen to his principles.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot, &ldquo;I beg yer pardon&mdash;ain&rsquo;t
    that enough?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you ought to wear a three-bushel
    bag and ashes for three months, and drink water; but since the police would
    send you to an asylum if you did that, I think the best thing we can do is
    to go out and have a drink.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas married an Australian girl somewhere, somehow, and brought
    her to Bourke, and there were two little girls&mdash;regular little fairies.
    She was a gentle, kind-hearted little woman, but she didn&rsquo;t seem to
    improve him much, save that he was very good to her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mostly that way,&rdquo; commented Mitchell. &ldquo;When
    a boss gets married and has children he thinks he&rsquo;s got a greater right
    to grind his fellowmen and rob their wives and children. I&rsquo;d never
    work for a boss with a big family&mdash;it&rsquo;s hard enough to keep a
    single boss nowadays in this country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>After one stormy election, at the end of a long and bitter shearing strike,
    One-eyed Bogan, his trusty enemy, Barcoo-Rot, and one or two other enthusiastic
    reformers were charged with rioting, and got from one to three months&rsquo; hard.
    And they had only smashed three windows of the Imperial Hotel and chased
    the Chinese cook into the river.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to have some hopes for Democracy,&rdquo; commented Mitchell,  &ldquo;but
    I&rsquo;ve got none now. How can you expect Liberty, Equality or Fraternity&mdash;how
    can you expect Freedom and Universal Brotherhood and Equal Rights in a country
    where Sons of Light get three months&rsquo; hard for breaking windows and
    bashing a Chinaman? It almost makes me long to sail away in a gallant barque.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There were other cases in connection with the rotten-egging of Capitalistic
    candidates on the Imperial Hotel balcony, and it was partly on the evidence
    of Douglas and his friends that certain respectable Labour leaders got heavy
    terms of imprisonment for rioting and &ldquo;sedition&rdquo; and &ldquo;inciting,&rdquo; in
    connection with organized attacks on blacklegs and their escorts.</p>
  <p>Retribution, if it was retribution, came suddenly and in a most unexpected
    manner to Lord Douglas.</p>
  <p>It seems he employed a second carpenter for six months to repair and make
    certain additions to the hotel, and put him off under various pretences until
    he owed him a hundred pounds or thereabout. At last, immediately after an
    exciting interview with Lord Douglas, the carpenter died suddenly of heart
    disease. The widow, a strong-minded bushwoman, put a bailiff in the hotel
    on a very short notice&mdash;and against the advice of her lawyer, who thought
    the case hopeless&mdash;and the Lord Douglas bubble promptly burst. He had
    somehow come to be regarded as the proprietor of the hotel, but now the real
    proprietors or proprietor&mdash;he was still said to be a priest&mdash;turned
    Douglas out and put in a new manager. The old servants were paid after some
    trouble. The local storekeepers and one or two firms in Sydney, who had large
    accounts against the Imperial Hotel (and had trusted it, mainly because it
    was patronized by Capitalism and Fat), were never paid.</p>
  <p>Lord Douglas cleared out to Sydney, leaving his wife and children, for the
    present, with her brother, a hay-and-corn storekeeper, who also had a large
    and hopeless account against the hotel; and when the brother went broke and
    left the district she rented a two-roomed cottage and took in dressmaking.</p>
  <p>Dressmaking didn&rsquo;t pay so well in the bush then as it did in the old
    diggings days when sewing-machines were scarce and the possession of one
    meant an independent living to any girl&mdash;when diggers paid ten shillings
    for a strip of &ldquo;flannen&rdquo; doubled over and sewn together, with
    holes for arms and head, and called a shirt. Mrs Douglas had a hard time,
    with her two little girls, who were still better and more prettily dressed
    than any other children in Bourke. One grocer still called on her for orders
    and pretended to be satisfied to wait &ldquo;till Mr Douglas came back,&rdquo; and
    when she would no longer order what he considered sufficient provisions for
    her and the children, and commenced buying sugar, etc., by the pound, for
    cash, he one day sent a box of groceries round to her. He pretended it was
    a mistake.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;However,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be very much obliged if
    you could use  &rsquo;em, Mrs Douglas. I&rsquo;m overstocked now; haven&rsquo;t
    got room for another tin of sardines in the shop. Don&rsquo;t you worry about
    bills, Mrs Douglas; I can wait till Douglas comes home. I did well enough
    out of the Imperial Hotel when your husband had it, and a pound&rsquo;s worth
    of groceries won&rsquo;t hurt me now. I&rsquo;m only too glad to get rid
    of some of the stock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She cried a little, thought of the children, and kept the groceries.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll be sold up soon meself if things don&rsquo;t
    git brighter,&rdquo; said that grocer to a friend, &ldquo;so it doesn&rsquo;t
    matter much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The same with Foley the butcher, who had a brogue with a sort of drawling
    groan in it, and was a cynic of the Mitchell school.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s as proud as the devil,
    but when I send round a bit o&rsquo; rawst, or porrk, or the undercut o&rsquo; the
    blade-bawn, she thinks o&rsquo; the little gur-r-rls before she thinks o&rsquo; sendin&rsquo; it
    back to me. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;ve got the pull on her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Giraffe borrowed a horse and tip-dray one day at the beginning of winter
    and cut a load of firewood in the bush, and next morning, at daylight, Mrs
    Douglas was nearly startled out of her life by a crash at the end of the
    cottage, which made her think that the chimney had fallen in, or a tree fallen
    on the house; and when she slipped on a wrapper and looked out, she saw a
    load of short-cut wood by the chimney, and caught a glimpse of the back view
    of the Giraffe, who stood in the dray with his legs wide apart and was disappearing
    into the edge of the scrub; and soon the rapid clock-clock-clock of the wheels
    died away in the west, as if he were making for West Australia.</p>
  <p>The next we heard of Lord Douglas he had got two years&rsquo; hard for embezzlement
    in connection with some canvassing he had taken up. Mrs Douglas fell ill&mdash;a
    touch of brain-fever&mdash;and one of the labourers&rsquo; wives took care
    of the children while two others took turns in nursing. While she was recovering,
    Bob Brothers sent round the hat, and, after a conclave in the Union Office&mdash;as
    mysterious as any meeting ever called with the object of downing bloated
    Capitalism&mdash;it was discovered that one of the chaps&mdash;who didn&rsquo;t
    wish his name to be mentioned&mdash;had borrowed just twenty-five pounds
    from Lord Douglas in the old days and now wished to return it to Mrs Douglas.
    So the thing was managed, and if she had any suspicions she kept them to
    herself. She started a little fancy goods shop and got along fairly comfortable.</p>
  <p>Douglas, by the way, was, publicly, supposed, for her sake and because of
    the little girls, to be away in West Australia on the goldfields.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Time passes without much notice out back, and one hot day, when the sun
    hung behind the fierce sandstorms from the northwest as dully lurid as he
    ever showed in a London fog, Lord Douglas got out of the train that had just
    finished its five-hundred-miles&rsquo; run, and not seeing a new-chum porter,
    who started forward by force of habit to take his bag, he walked stiffly
    off the platform and down the main street towards his wife&rsquo;s cottage.</p>
  <p>He was very gaunt, and his eyes, to those who passed him closely, seemed
    to have a furtive, hunted expression. He had let his beard grow, and it had
    grown grey.</p>
  <p>It was within a few days of Christmas&mdash;the same Christmas that we lost
    the Pretty Girl in the Salvation Army. As a rule the big shearing-sheds within
    a fortnight of Bourke cut out in time for the shearers to reach the town
    and have their Christmas dinners and sprees&mdash;and for some of them to
    be locked up over Christmas Day&mdash;within sound of a church-going bell.
    Most of the chaps gathered in the Shearers&rsquo; Union Office on New Year&rsquo;s
    Eve and discussed Douglas amongst other things.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I vote we kick the cow out of the town!&rdquo; snarled One-eyed Bogan,
    viciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; said Bob Brothers (the Giraffe), speaking
    more promptly than usual. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s his wife and youngsters to
    consider, yer know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He something well deserted his wife,&rdquo; snarled Bogan, &ldquo;an&rsquo; now
    he comes crawlin&rsquo; back to her to keep him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, mildly, &ldquo;but we ain&rsquo;t all
    got as much against him as you have, Bogan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He made a crimson jail-bird of me!&rdquo; snapped Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;that didn&rsquo;t hurt you much,
    anyway; it rather improved your character if anything. Besides, he made a
    jail-bird of himself afterwards, so you ought to have a fellow-feeling&mdash;a
    feathered feeling, so to speak. Now you needn&rsquo;t be offended, Bogan,
    we&rsquo;re all jail-birds at heart, only we haven&rsquo;t all got the pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favour of blanky well tarrin&rsquo; an&rsquo; featherin&rsquo; him
    an&rsquo;  kickin&rsquo; him out of the town!&rdquo; shouted Bogan. &ldquo;It
    would be a good turn to his wife, too; she&rsquo;d be well rid of the &mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps she&rsquo;s fond of him,&rdquo; suggested Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
    known such cases before. I saw them sitting together on the veranda last
    night when they thought no one was looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He deserted her,&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan, in a climbingdown tone,  &ldquo;and
    left her to starve.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps the police were to blame for that,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You
    know you deserted all your old mates once for three months, Bogan, and it
    wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He seems to be a crimson pet of yours, Jack Mitchell,&rdquo; said
    Bogan, firing up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, all I know,&rdquo; said Mitchell, standing up and stretching
    himself wearily, &ldquo;all I know is that he looked like a gentleman once,
    and treated us like a gentleman, and cheated us like a gentleman, and ran
    some of us in like a gentleman, and, as far as I can see, he&rsquo;s served
    his time like a gentleman and come back to face us and live himself down
    like a man. I always had a sneaking regard for a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why, Mitchell, I&rsquo;m beginning to think you are a gentleman yourself,&rdquo; said
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I used to have a suspicion once
    that I had a drop of blue blood in me somewhere, and it worried me a lot;
    but I asked my old mother about it one day, and she scalded me&mdash;God
    bless her!&mdash;and father chased me with a stockwhip, so I gave up making
    inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll join the bloomin&rsquo; Capitalists next,&rdquo; sneered
    Oneeyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish I could, Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d take
    a trip to Paris and see for myself whether the Frenchwomen are as bad as
    they&rsquo;re made out to be, or go to Japan. But what are we going to do
    about Douglas?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kick the skunk out of town, or boycott him!&rdquo; said one or two. &ldquo;He
    ought to be tarred and feathered and hanged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do worse than hang him,&rdquo; commented Jake Boreham,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, we could,&rdquo; said Mitchell, sitting down, resting his
    elbows on his knees, and marking his points with one forefinger on the other.  &ldquo;For
    instance, we might boil him slow in tar. We might skin him alive. We might
    put him in a cage and poke him with sticks, with his wife and children in
    another cage to look on and enjoy the fun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The chaps, who had been sitting quietly listening to Mitchell, and grinning,
    suddenly became serious and shifted their positions uneasily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I can tell you what would hurt his feelings more than anything
    else we could do,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, what is it, Jack?&rdquo; said Tom Hall, rather impatiently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send round the hat and take up a collection for him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, &ldquo;enough to let him get away with his wife and children and
    start life again in some less respectable town than Bourke. You needn&rsquo;t
    grin, I&rsquo;m serious about it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a thoughtful pause, and one or two scratched their heads.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;His wife seems pretty sick,&rdquo; Mitchell went on in a reflective
    tone. &ldquo;I passed the place this morning and saw him scrubbing out the
    floor. He&rsquo;s been doing a bit of house-painting for old Heegard to-day.
    I suppose he learnt it in jail. I saw him at work and touched my hat to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Tom Hall, affecting to shrink from Mitchell in
    horror.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I didn&rsquo;t
    take my hat off. Now I know it&rsquo;s not bush religion for a man to touch
    his hat, except to a funeral, or a strange roof or woman sometimes; but when
    I meet a braver man than myself I salute him. I&rsquo;ve only met two in
    my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And who were they, Jack?&rdquo; asked Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said Mitchell&mdash;&ldquo;one is Douglas, and the other&mdash;well,
    the other was the man I used to be. But that&rsquo;s got nothing to do with
    it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But perhaps Douglas thought you were crowing over him when you took
    off your hat to him&mdash;sneerin&rsquo; at him, like, Mitchell,&rdquo; reflected
    Jake Boreham.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Jake,&rdquo; said Mitchell, growing serious suddenly. &ldquo;There
    are ways of doing things that another man understands. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>They all thought for a while.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;supposing we do take up a collection
    for him, he&rsquo;d be too damned proud to take it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s where we&rsquo;ve got the pull on him,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell, brightening up. &ldquo;I heard Dr Morgan say that Mrs Douglas wouldn&rsquo;t
    live if she wasn&rsquo;t sent away to a cooler place, and Douglas knows it;
    and, besides, one of the little girls is sick. We&rsquo;ve got him in a corner
    and he&rsquo;ll have to take the stuff. Besides, two years in jail takes
    a lot of the pride out of a man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m damned if I&rsquo;ll give a sprat to help the man
    who tried his best to crush the Unions!&rdquo; said One-eyed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Damned if I will either!&rdquo; said Barcoo-Rot.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, look here, One-eyed Bogan,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
    like to harp on old things, for I know they bore you, but when you returned
    to public life that time no one talked of kicking you out of the town. In
    fact, I heard that the chaps put a few pounds together to help you get away
    for a while till you got over your modesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No one spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I passed Douglas&rsquo;s place on my way here from my camp to-night,&rdquo;  Mitchell
    went on musingly, &ldquo;and I saw him walking up and down in the yard with
    his sick child in his arms. You remember that little girl, Bogan? I saw her
    run and pick up your hat and give it to you one day when you were trying
    to put it on with your feet. You remember, Bogan? The shock nearly sobered
    you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a very awkward pause. The position had become too psychological
    altogether and had to be ended somehow. The awkward silence had to be broken,
    and Bogan broke it.</p>
  <p>He turned up Bob Brothers&rsquo;s hat, which was lying on the table, and  &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; in
    a &ldquo;quid,&rdquo; qualifying the hat and the quid, and disguising his
    feelings with the national oath of the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough of this gory, maudlin, sentimental tommy-rot,&rdquo;  he
    said. &ldquo;Here, Barcoo, stump up or I&rsquo;ll belt it out of your hide!
    I&rsquo;ll&mdash;I&rsquo;ll take yer to pieces!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Douglas didn&rsquo;t leave the town. He sent his wife and children to
    Sydney until the heat wave was past, built a new room on to the cottage,
    and started a book and newspaper shop, and a poultry farm in the back paddock,
    and flourished.</p>
  <p>They called him Mr Douglas for a while, then Douglas, then Percy Douglas,
    and now he is well-known as Old Daddy Douglas, and the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Worker</i>,&nbsp;<i>Truth</i>,
    and&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>, and other democratic rags are on sale at his shop.
    He is big with schemes for locking the Darling River, and he gets his drink
    at O&rsquo;Donohoo&rsquo;s. He is scarcely yet regarded as a straight-out
    democrat. He was a gentleman once, Mitchell said, and the old blood was not
    to be trusted. But, last elections, Douglas worked quietly for Unionism,
    and gave the leaders certain hints, and put them up to various electioneering
    dodges which enabled them to return, in the face of Monopoly, a Labour member
    who is as likely to go straight as long as any other Labour member.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBlindnessofOneEyedBogan"></a>The Blindness
      of One-Eyed Bogan</b></h2>
  <p class="note">They judge not and they are not judged&mdash;&rsquo;tis their
    philosophy&mdash;<br>
    (There&rsquo;s something wrong with every ship that sails upon the sea).<br>
  &mdash;<i>The Ballad of the Rouseabout</i>.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&nbsp;what became of One-eyed Bogan?&rdquo; I asked Tom Hall when
    I met him and Jack Mitchell down in Sydney with their shearing cheques the
    Christmas before last.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better ask Mitchell, Harry,&rdquo; said Tom. &ldquo;He
    can tell you about Bogan better than I can. But first, what about the drink
    we&rsquo;re going to have?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>We turned out of Pitt Street into Hunter Street, and across George Street,
    where a double line of fast electric tramway was running, into Margaret Street
    and had a drink at Pfahlert&rsquo;s Hotel, where a counter lunch&mdash;as
    good as many dinners you get for a shilling&mdash;was included with a sixpenny
    drink. &ldquo;Get a quiet corner,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I like to
    hear myself cackle.&rdquo; So we took our beer out in the fernery and got
    a cool place at a little table in a quiet corner amongst the fern boxes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, One-eyed Bogan was a hard case, Mitchell,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t
    he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, putting down his &ldquo;long-beer&rdquo; glass, &ldquo;he
    was.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather a bad egg!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, a regular bad egg,&rdquo; said Mitchell, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I heard he got caught cheating at cards,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you!&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Well, I believe he did. Ah,
    well,&rdquo; he added reflectively, after another long pull, &ldquo;One-eyed
    Bogan won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is he dead then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;how did that happen?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lost the other eye,&rdquo; said Mitchell, and he took another
    drink.  &ldquo;Ah, well, he won&rsquo;t cheat at cards any more&mdash;unless
    there&rsquo;s cards invented for the blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;you see, Harry, it was this way.
    Bogan went pretty free in Bourke after the shearing before last, and in the
    end he got mixed up in a very ugly-looking business: he was accused of doing
    two new-chum jackeroos out of their stuff by some sort of confidence trick.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confidence trick,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never have thought
    that One-eyed Bogan had the brains to go in for that sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems he had, or else he used somebody else&rsquo;s brains;
    there&rsquo;s plenty of broken-down English gentlemen sharpers knocking about
    out back, you know, and Bogan might have been taking lessons from one. I
    don&rsquo;t know the rights of the case, it was hushed up, as you&rsquo;ll
    see presently; but, anyway, the jackeroos swore that Bogan had done &rsquo;em
    out of ten quid. They were both Cockneys and I suppose they reckoned themselves
    smart, but bushmen have more time to think. Besides, Bogan&rsquo;s one eye
    was in his favour. You see he always kept his one eye fixed strictly on whatever
    business he had in hand; if he&rsquo;d had another eye to rove round and
    distract his attention and look at things on the outside, the chances are
    he would never have got into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Jack,&rdquo; said Tom Hall. &ldquo;Harry wants to
    hear the yarn.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, to make it short, one of the jackeroos went to the police and
    Bogan cleared out. His character was pretty bad just then, so there was a
    piece of blue paper out for him. Bogan didn&rsquo;t seem to think the thing
    was so serious as it was, for he only went a few miles down the river and
    camped with his horses on a sort of island inside an anabranch, till the
    thing should blow over or the new chums leave Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Constable Campbell, got wind of Bogan&rsquo;s
    camp, and started out after him. He rode round the outside track and came
    in on to the river just below where the anabranch joins it, at the lower
    end of the island and right opposite Bogan&rsquo;s camp. You know what those
    billabongs are dry gullies till the river rises from the Queensland rains
    and backs them up till the water runs round into the river again and makes
    anabranches of &rsquo;em&mdash;places that you thought were hollows you&rsquo;ll
    find above water, and you can row over places you thought were hills. There&rsquo;s
    no water so treacherous and deceitful as you&rsquo;ll find in some of those
    billabongs. A man starts to ride across a place where he thinks the water
    is just over the grass, and blunders into a deep channel&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t
    there before&mdash;with a steady undercurrent with the whole weight of the
    Darling River funnelled into it; and if he can&rsquo;t swim and his horse
    isn&rsquo;t used to it&mdash;or sometimes if he can swim&mdash;it&rsquo;s
    a case with him, and the Darling River cod hold an inquest on him, if they
    have time, before he&rsquo;s burried deep in Darling River mud for ever.
    And somebody advertises in the missing column for Jack Somebody who was last
    heard of in Australia.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind that, Mitchell, go on,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, Campbell knew the river and saw that there was a stiff current
    there, so he hailed Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good day, Campbell,&rsquo; shouted Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I want you, Bogan,&rsquo; said Campbell. &lsquo;Come across
    and bring your horses.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m damned if I will,&rsquo; says Bogan. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
    not going to catch me death o&rsquo; cold to save your skin. If you want
    me you&rsquo;ll have to bloody well come and git me.&rsquo; Bogan was a good
    strong swimmer, and he had good horses, but he didn&rsquo;t try to get away&mdash;I
    suppose he reckoned he&rsquo;d have to face the music one time or another&mdash;and
    one time is as good as another out back.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell was no swimmer; he had no temptation to risk his life&mdash;you
    see it wasn&rsquo;t as in war with a lot of comrades watching ready to advertise
    a man as a coward for staying alive&mdash;so he argued with Bogan and tried
    to get him to listen to reason, and swore at him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll make
    it damned hot for you, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if I have to come over
    for you.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two can play at that game,&rsquo; says Bogan.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Look here, Bogan,&rdquo; said Campbell, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
    tell you what I&rsquo;ll do. If you give me your word that you&rsquo;ll come
    up to the police station to-morrow I&rsquo;ll go back and say nothing about
    it. You can say you didn&rsquo;t know a warrant was out after you. It will
    be all the better for you in the end. Better give me your word, man.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps Campbell knew Bogan better than any of us.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now then, Bogan,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t be a fool.
    Give your word like a sensible man, and I&rsquo;ll go back. I&rsquo;ll give
    you five minutes to make up your mind.&rsquo; And he took out his watch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But Bogan was nasty and wouldn&rsquo;t give his word, so there was
    nothing for it but for Campbell to make a try for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Campbell had plenty of pluck, or obstinacy, which amounts to the
    same thing. He put his carbine and revolver under a log, out of the rain
    that was coming on, saw to his handcuffs, and then spurred his horse into
    the water. Bogan lit his pipe with a stick from his camp-fire&mdash;so Campbell
    said afterwards&mdash;and sat down on his heels and puffed away, and waited
    for him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as Campbell&rsquo;s horse floundered into the current Bogan
    shouted to go back, but Campbell thought it was a threat and kept on. But
    Bogan had caught sight of a log coming down the stream, end on, with a sharp,
    splintered end, and before Campbell knew where he was, the sharp end of the
    log caught the horse in the flank. The horse started to plunge and struggle
    sideways, with all his legs, and Campbell got free of him as quick as he
    could. Now, you know, in some of those Darling River reaches the current
    will seem to run steadily for a while, and then come with a rush. (I was
    caught in one of those rushes once, when I was in swimming, and would have
    been drowned if I hadn&rsquo;t been born to be hanged.) Well, a rush came
    along just as Campbell got free from his horse, and he went down-stream one
    side of a snag and his horse the other. Campbell&rsquo;s pretty stout, you
    know, and his uniform was tight, and it handicapped him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as he was being washed past the lower end of the snag he caught
    hold of a branch that stuck out of the water and held on. He swung round
    and saw Bogan running down to the point opposite him. Now, you know there
    was always a lot of low cunning about Bogan, and I suppose he reckoned that
    if he pulled Campbell out he&rsquo;d stand a good show of getting clear of
    his trouble; anyway, if he didn&rsquo;t save Campbell it might be said that
    he killed him&mdash;besides, Bogan was a good swimmer, so there wasn&rsquo;t
    any heroism about it anyhow. Campbell was only a few feet from the bank,
    but Bogan started to strip&mdash;to make the job look as big as possible,
    I suppose. He shouted to Campbell to say he was coming, and to hold on.</p>
  <p>Campbell said afterwards that Bogan seemed an hour undressing. The weight
    of the current was forcing down the bough that Campbell was hanging on to,
    and suddenly, he said, he felt a great feeling of helplessness take him by
    the shoulders. He yelled to Bogan and let go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, it happened that Jake Boreham and I were passing away the time
    between shearings, and we were having a sort of fishing and shooting loaf
    down the river in a boat arrangement that Jake had made out of boards and
    tarred canvas. We called her the&nbsp;<i>Jolly Coffin</i>. We were just poking
    up the bank in the slack water, a few hundred yards below the billabong,
    when Jake said, &lsquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a horse or something in the river.&rsquo; Then
    he shouted,  &lsquo;No, by God, it&rsquo;s a man,&rsquo; and we poked the&nbsp;<i>Coffin</i>&nbsp;out
    into the stream for all she was worth. &lsquo;Looks like two men fighting
    in the water,&rsquo; Jake shouts presently. &lsquo;Hurry up, or they&rsquo;ll
    drown each other.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We hailed &rsquo;em, and Bogan shouted for help. He was treading
    water and holding Campbell up in front of him now in real professional style.
    As soon as he heard us he threw up his arms and splashed a bit&mdash;I reckoned
    he was trying to put as much style as he could into that rescue. But I caught
    a crab, and, before we could get to them, they were washed past into the
    top of a tree that stood well below flood-mark. I pulled the boat&rsquo;s
    head round and let her stern down between the branches. Bogan had one arm
    over a limb and was holding Campbell with the other, and trying to lift him
    higher out of the water. I noticed Bogan&rsquo;s face was bleeding&mdash;there
    was a dead limb stuck in the tree with nasty sharp points on it, and I reckoned
    he&rsquo;d run his face against one of them. Campbell was gasping like a
    codfish out of water, and he was the whitest man I ever saw (except one,
    and he&rsquo;d been drowned for a week). Campbell had the sense to keep still.
    We asked Bogan if he could hold on, and he said he could, but he couldn&rsquo;t
    hold Campbell any longer. So Jake took the oars and I leaned over the stern
    and caught hold of Campbell, and Jake ran the boat into the bank, and we
    got him ashore; then we went back for Bogan and landed him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We had some whisky and soon brought Campbell round; but Bogan was
    bleeding like a pig from a nasty cut over his good eye, so we bound wet handkerchiefs
    round his eyes and led him to a log and he sat down for a while, holding
    his hand to his eye and groaning. He kept saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m blind,
    mates, I&rsquo;m blind! I&rsquo;ve lost me other eye!&rsquo; but we didn&rsquo;t
    dream it was so bad as that: we kept giving him whisky. We got some dry boughs
    and made a big fire. Then Bogan stood up and held his arms stiff down to
    his sides, opening and shutting his hands as if he was in great pain. And
    I&rsquo;ve often thought since what a different man Bogan seemed without
    his clothes and with the broken bridge of his nose and his eyes covered by
    the handkerchiefs. He was clean shaven, and his mouth and chin are his best
    features, and he&rsquo;s clean limbed and well hung. I often thought afterwards
    that there was something of a blind god about him as he stood there naked
    by the fire on the day he saved Campbell&rsquo;s life&mdash;something that
    reminded me of a statue I saw once in the Art Gallery. (Pity the world isn&rsquo;t
    blinder to a man&rsquo;s worst points.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Presently Jake listened and said, &lsquo;By God, that&rsquo;s lucky!&rsquo; and
    we heard a steamer coming up-river and presently we saw her coming round
    the point with a couple of wool-barges in tow. We got Bogan aboard and got
    some clothes on him, and took him ashore at Bourke to the new hospital. The
    doctors did all they knew, but Bogan was blind for life. He never saw anything
    again&mdash;except &lsquo;a sort of dull white blur,&rsquo; as he called
    it&mdash;or his past life sometimes, I suppose. Perhaps he saw that for the
    first time. Ah, well!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s old enemy, Barcoo-Rot, went to see him in the hospital,
    and Bogan said, &lsquo;Well, Barcoo, I reckon we&rsquo;ve had our last fight.
    I owe you a hiding, but I don&rsquo;t see how I&rsquo;m going to pay you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never
    mind that, Bogan, old man,&rsquo; says Barcoo. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take it
    from anyone yer likes to appoint, if that worries yer; and, look here, Bogan,
    if I can&rsquo;t fight you I can fight for you&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you
    forget it!&rsquo; And Barcoo used to lead Bogan round about town in his spare
    time and tell him all that was going on; and I believe he always had an ear
    cocked in case someone said a word against Bogan&mdash;as if any of the chaps
    would say a word against a blind man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s case was hushed up. The police told us to fix it up
    the best way we could. One of the jackeroos, who reckoned that Bogan had
    swindled him, was a gentleman, and he was the first to throw a quid in the
    Giraffe&rsquo;s hat when it went round for Bogan, but the other jackeroo
    was a cur: he said he wanted the money that Bogan had robbed him of. There
    were two witnesses, but we sent &rsquo;em away, and Tom Hall, there, scared
    the jackeroo. You know Tom was always the best hand we had at persuading
    witnesses in Union cases to go home to see their mothers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How did you scare that jackeroo, Tom?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell you about it some other time,&rdquo; said Tom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;Bogan was always a good woolsorter,
    so, next shearing, old Baldy Thompson&mdash;(you know Baldy Thompson, Harry,
    of West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station)&mdash;Baldy had a talk with some of the
    chaps, and took Bogan out in his buggy with him to West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.
    Bogan would sit at the end of the rolling tables, in the shearing-shed, with
    a boy to hand him the fleeces, and he&rsquo;d feel a fleece and tell the
    boy what bin to throw it into; and by and by he began to learn to throw the
    fleeces into the bins himself. And sometimes Baldy would have a sheep brought
    to him and get him to feel the fleece and tell him the quality of it. And
    then again Baldy would talk, just loud enough for Bogan to overhear, and
    swear that he&rsquo;d sooner have Bogan, blind as he was, than half a dozen
    scientific jackeroo experts with all their eyes about them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of course Bogan wasn&rsquo;t worth anything much to Baldy, but Baldy
    gave him two pounds a week out of his own pocket, and another quid that we
    made up between us; so he made enough to pull him through the rest of the
    year.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was curious to see how soon he learned to find his way about the
    hut and manage his tea and tucker. It was a rough shed, but everybody was
    eager to steer Bogan about&mdash;and, in fact, two of them had a fight about
    it one day. Baldy and all of us&mdash;and especially visitors when they came&mdash;were
    mighty interested in Bogan; and I reckon we were rather proud of having a
    blind wool-sorter. I reckon Bogan had thirty or forty pairs of eyes watching
    out for him in case he&rsquo;d run against something or fall. It irritated
    him to be messed round too much&mdash;he said a baby would never learn to
    walk if it was held all the time. He reckoned he&rsquo;d learn more in a
    year than a man who&rsquo;d served a lifetime to blindness; but we didn&rsquo;t
    let him wander much&mdash;for fear he&rsquo;d fall into the big rocky waterhole
    there, by accident.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And after the shearing-season Bogan&rsquo;s wife turned up in Bourke&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bogan&rsquo;s wife!&rdquo; I exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, I never knew
    Bogan was married.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither did anyone else,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But he was.
    Perhaps that was what accounted for Bogan. Sometimes, in his sober moods,
    I used to have an idea that there must have been something behind the Bogan
    to account for him. Perhaps he got trapped&mdash;or got married and found
    out that he&rsquo;d made a mistake&mdash;which is about the worst thing a
    man can find out &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Except that his wife made the mistake, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom
    Hall.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or that both did,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell. &ldquo;Ah, well!&mdash;never
    mind&mdash;Bogan had been married two or three years. Maybe he got married
    when he was on the spree&mdash;I knew that he used to send money to someone
    in Sydney and I suppose it was her. Anyway, she turned up after he was blind.
    She was a hard-looking woman&mdash;just the sort that might have kept a third-rate
    pub or a sly-grog shop. But you can&rsquo;t judge between husband and wife,
    unless you&rsquo;ve lived in the same house with them&mdash;and under the
    same roofs with their parents right back to Adam for that matter. Anyway,
    she stuck to Bogan all right; she took a little two-roomed cottage and made
    him comfortable&mdash;she&rsquo;s got a sewing-machine and a mangle and takes
    in washing and sewing. She brought a carrotty-headed youngster with her,
    and the first time I saw Bogan sitting on the veranda with that youngster
    on his knee I thought it was a good thing that he was blind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because the youngster isn&rsquo;t his,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the look of it&mdash;and by the look on her face, once, when she
    caught me squinting from the kid&rsquo;s face to Bogan&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And whose was it!&rdquo; I asked, without thinking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How am I to know?&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It might be yours
    for all I know&mdash;it&rsquo;s ugly enough, and you never had any taste
    in women. But you mustn&rsquo;t speak of that in Bourke. But there&rsquo;s
    another youngster coming, and I&rsquo;ll swear that&rsquo;ll be Bogan&rsquo;s
    all right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A curious thing about Bogan is that he&rsquo;s begun to be fidgety
    about his personal appearance&mdash;and you know he wasn&rsquo;t a dood.
    He wears a collar now, and polishes his boots; he wears elasticsides, and
    polishes &rsquo;em himself&mdash;the only thing is that he blackens over
    the elastic. He can do many things for himself, and he&rsquo;s proud of it.
    He says he can see many things that he couldn&rsquo;t see when he had his
    eyes. You seldom hear him swear, save in a friendly way; he seems much gentler,
    but he reckons he would stand a show with Barcoo-Rot even now, if Barcoo
    would stand up in front of him and keep yelling&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;how did Bogan lose the sight of
    his other eye?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleeping out in the rain when he was drunk,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;He
    got a cold in his eye.&rdquo; Then he asked, suddenly:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did you ever see a blind man cry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;You know Bogan wears goggles
    to hide his eyes&mdash;his wife made him do that. The chaps often used to
    drop round and have a yarn with Bogan and cheer him up, and one evening I
    was sitting smoking with him, and yarning about old times, when he got very
    quiet all of a sudden, and I saw a tear drop from under one of his shutters
    and roll down his cheek. It wasn&rsquo;t the eye he lost saving Campbell&mdash;it
    was the old wall-eye he used to use in the days before he was called &lsquo;One-eyed
    Bogan.&rsquo; I suppose he thought it was dark and that I couldn&rsquo;t
    see his face. (There&rsquo;s a good many people in this world who think you
    can&rsquo;t see because they can&rsquo;t.) It made me feel like I used to
    feel sometimes in the days when I felt things&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on, Mitchell,&rdquo; said Tom Hall, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve had
    enough beer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think I have,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;Besides, I promised
    to send a wire to Jake Boreham to tell him that his mother&rsquo;s dead.
    Jake&rsquo;s shearing at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday; shearing won&rsquo;t be over
    for three or four weeks, and Jake wants an excuse to get away without offending
    old Baldy and come down and have a fly round with us before the holidays
    are over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Down at the telegraph-office Mitchell took a form and filled it in very
    carefully:&mdash;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Jacob Boreham. West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station. Bourke. <br>
    Come home at once. Mother is dead. In terrible trouble. Father dying.<br>
  &mdash;MARY&nbsp;BOREHAM.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think that will do,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;It ought to satisfy
    Baldy, and it won&rsquo;t give Jake too much of a shock, because he hasn&rsquo;t
    got a sister or sister-in-law, and his father and mother&rsquo;s been dead
    over ten years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, if I was running a theatre,&rdquo; said Mitchell, as we left
    the office, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give five pounds a night for the face Jake&rsquo;ll
    have on him when he takes that telegram to Baldy Thompson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TwoSundowners"></a>Two Sundowners</b></h2>
  <p>Sheep&nbsp;stations in Australia are any distance from twenty to a hundred
    miles apart, to keep well within the boundaries of truth and the great pastoral
    country. Shearing at any one shed only lasts a few weeks in the year; the
    number of men employed is according to the size of the shed&mdash;from three
    to five men in the little bough-covered shed of the small &ldquo;cockatoo,&rdquo; up
    to a hundred and fifty or two hundred hands all told in the big corrugated
    iron machine shed of a pastoral company.</p>
  <p>Shearing starts early up in northern Queensland, where you can get a &ldquo;January
    shed;&rdquo; and further south, in February, March or April sheds, and so
    on down into New South Wales, where shearing often lasts over Christmas.
    Shearers travel from shed to shed; some go a travel season without getting
    a pen, and an unlucky shearer might ride or tramp for several seasons and
    never get hands in wool; and all this explains the existence of the &ldquo;footman&rdquo; with
    his swag and the horseman with his packhorse. They have a rough life, and
    the Australian shearers are certainly the most democratic and perhaps the
    most independent, intelligent and generous body of workmen in the world.</p>
  <p>Shearers at a shed elect their own cook, pay him so much a head, and they
    buy their rations in the lump from the station store; and  &ldquo;travellers,&rdquo; i.e.
    shearers and rouseabouts travelling for work, are invited, as a matter of
    course, to sit down to the shearers&rsquo; table. Also a certain allowance
    of tea, sugar, flour or meat is still made to travellers at most Western
    station stores; so it would be rather surprising if there weren&rsquo;t some
    who travelled on the game. The swagman loafer, or &ldquo;bummer,&rdquo; times
    himself, especially in bad weather, to arrive at the shed just about sundown;
    he is then sure of &ldquo;tea,&rdquo; shelter for the night, breakfast, and
    some tucker from the cook to take him on along the track. Brummy and Swampy
    were sundowners.</p>
  <p>Swampy was a bummer born&mdash;and proud of it. Brummy had drifted down
    to loaferdom, and his nature was soured and his spirit revengeful against
    the world because of the memory of early years wasted at hard work and in
    being honest. Both were short and stout, and both had scrubby beards, but
    Brummy&rsquo;s beard was a dusty black and Swampy&rsquo;s fiery red&mdash;he
    indulged in a monkey-shave sometimes, but his lower face was mostly like
    a patch of coarse stubble with a dying hedge round it. They had travelled
    together for a long time. They seemed at times to hate each other with a
    murderous hatred, but they were too lazy to fight. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    tramp side by side and growl at each other by the hour, other times they&rsquo;d
    sulk for days; one would push on ahead and the other drop behind until there
    was a mile or two between them; but one always carried the billy, or the
    sugar, or something that was necessary to the comfort of the other, so they&rsquo;d
    come together at sundown. They had travelled together a long time, and perhaps
    that was why they hated each other. They often agreed to part and take different
    tracks, and sometimes they parted&mdash;for a while. They agreed in cadging,
    and cadged in turn. They carried a spare set of tucker-bags, and if, for
    instance, they were out of sugar and had plenty flour and tea, Brummy or
    Swampy would go to the store, boundary-rider&rsquo;s hut, or selector&rsquo;s,
    with the sugar-bag in his hand and the other bags in his shirt front on spec.
    He&rsquo;d get the sugar first, and then, if it looked good enough, the flour-bag
    would come out, then the tea-bag. And before he left he&rsquo;d remark casually
    that he and his mate hadn&rsquo;t had a smoke for two days. They never missed
    a chance. And when they&rsquo;d cadged more tucker than they could comfortably
    carry, they&rsquo;d camp for a day or two and eat it down. Sometimes they&rsquo;d
    have as much as a pound of tobacco, all in little &ldquo;borrowed&rdquo; bits,
    cut from the sticks or cakes of honest travellers. They never missed a chance.
    If a stranger gave Swampy his cake of tobacco with instructions to &ldquo;cut
    off a pipeful,&rdquo; Swampy would cut off as much as he thought judicious,
    talking to the stranger and watching his eye all the time, and hiding his
    palm as much as possible&mdash;and sometimes, when he knew he&rsquo;d cut
    off more than he could cram into his pipe, he&rsquo;d put his hand in his
    pocket for the pipe and drop some of the tobacco there. Then he&rsquo;d hand
    the plug to his mate, engage the stranger in conversation and try to hold
    his eye or detract his attention from Brummy so as to give Brummy a chance
    of cutting off a couple of pipefuls, and, maybe, nicking off a corner of
    the cake and slipping it into his pocket. I once heard a bushman say that
    no one but a skunk would be guilty of this tobacco trick&mdash;that it is
    about the meanest trick a man could be capable of&mdash;<i>because it spoils
    the chances of the next hard-up swaggy who asks the victim for tobacco</i>.</p>
  <p>When Brummy and Swampy came to a shed where shearing was in full swing,
    they&rsquo;d inquire, first thing, and with some show of anxiety, if there
    was any chance of gettin&rsquo; on; if the shed was full-handed they&rsquo;d
    growl about hard times, wonder what the country was coming to; talk of their
    missuses and kids that they&rsquo;d left in Sydney, curse the squatters and
    the Government, and, next morning, get a supply of rations from the cook
    and depart with looks of gloom. If, on the other hand, there was room in
    the shed for one or both of them, and the boss told them to go to work in
    the morning, they&rsquo;d keep it quiet from the cook if possible, and depart,
    after breakfast, unostentatiously.</p>
  <p>Sometimes, at the beginning of a drought, when the tall dead grass was like
    tinder for hundreds of miles and a carelessly-dropped match would set the
    whole country on fire, Swampy would strike a hard-faced squatter, manager
    or overseer with a cold eye, and the conversation would be somewhat as follows</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Good day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (shortly): &ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Any chance of a job?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Got all I want and we don&rsquo;t start for a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Can I git a bit o&rsquo; meat?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw! Don&rsquo;t kill till Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Pint o&rsquo; flour?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; tea or sugar, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw&mdash;what next?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Bit o&rsquo; baccer, boss. Ain&rsquo;t had a smoke for a
    week.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Naw. Ain&rsquo;t got enough for meself till the wagon comes
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Ah, well! It&rsquo;s hot, ain&rsquo;t it, boss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes&mdash;it&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Country very dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Yes. Looks like it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;A fire &rsquo;ud be very bad just now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now I&rsquo;m allers very careful with matches an&rsquo; fire
    when I&rsquo;m on the track.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are yer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. I never lights a fire near the grass&mdash;allers in
    the middle of the track&mdash;it&rsquo;s the safest place yer can get. An&rsquo; I
    allers puts the fire out afore I leaves the camp. If there ain&rsquo;t no
    water ter spare I covers the ashes with dirt. An&rsquo; some fellers are
    so careless with matches lightin&rsquo;  their pipes.&rdquo; (Reflective
    pause.)</p>
  <p>Boss: &ldquo;Are they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Swampy: &ldquo;Yes. Now, when I lights me pipe on the track in dry weather
    I allers rubs the match head up an&rsquo; drops it in the dust. I never drops
    a burnin&rsquo; match. But some travellers is so careless. A chap might light
    his pipe an&rsquo; fling the match away without thinkin&rsquo; an&rsquo; the
    match might fall in a dry tuft, an&rsquo;&mdash;there yer are!&rdquo; (with
    a wave of his arms). &ldquo;Hundreds of miles o&rsquo;  grass gone an&rsquo; thousands
    o&rsquo; sheep starvin&rsquo;. Some fellers is so careless&mdash;they never
    thinks. . . . An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, they don&rsquo;t care if they
    burn the whole country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Boss (scratching his head reflectively): &ldquo;Ah&mdash;umph!&mdash;You
    can go up to the store and get a bit of tucker. The storekeeper might let
    yer have a bit o&rsquo; tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>On one occasion, when they were out of flour and meat; Brummy and Swampy
    came across two other pilgrims camped on a creek, who were also out of flour
    and meat. One of them had tried a surveyors&rsquo; camp a little further
    down, but without success. The surveyors&rsquo; cook had said that he was
    short of flour and meat himself. Brummy tried him&mdash;no luck. Then Swampy
    said&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;go and have a try. As luck would have it,
    the surveyors&rsquo; cook was just going to bake; he had got the flour out
    in the dish, put in the salt and baking powder, mixed it up, and had gone
    to the creek for a billy of water when Swampy arrived. While the cook was
    gone Swampy slipped the flour out of the dish into his bag,&nbsp;<i>wiped</i>&nbsp;the
    dish, set it down again, and planted the bag behind a tree at a little distance.
    Then he stood waiting, holding a spare empty bag in his hand. When the cook
    came back he glanced at the dish, lowered the billy of water slowly to the
    ground, scratched his head, and looked at the dish again in a puzzled way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Blanked if I didn&rsquo;t think I got that flour out!&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, mate?&rdquo; asked Swampy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why! I could have sworn I got the flour out in the dish and mixed
    it before I went for the water,&rdquo; said the cook, staring at the dish
    again.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s rum what tricks your memory plays on you sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Swampy, showing interest, while the cook got some
    more flour out into the dish from a bag in the back of the tent. &ldquo;It
    is strange. I&rsquo;ve done the same thing meself. I suppose it&rsquo;s the
    heat that makes us all a bit off at times.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you cook, then?&rdquo; asked the surveyors&rsquo; cook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. I&rsquo;ve done a good bit of it in me time; but it&rsquo;s
    about played out. I&rsquo;m after stragglers now.&rdquo; (Stragglers are
    stray sheep missed in the general muster and found about the out paddocks
    and shorn after the general shearing.)</p>
  <p>They had a yarn and Swampy &ldquo;bit the cook&rsquo;s ear&rdquo; for a &ldquo;bit
    o&rsquo; meat an&rsquo; tea an&rsquo; sugar,&rdquo; not forgetting &ldquo;a
    handful of flour if yer can spare it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; said the cook, &ldquo;but I can only let you have about
    a pint. We&rsquo;re very short ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo; said Swampy, as he put the stuff
    into his spare bags. &ldquo;Thank you! Good day!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good day,&rdquo; said the cook.</p>
  <p>The cook went on with his work and Swampy departed, catching up the bag
    of flour from behind the tree as he passed it, and keeping the clump of timber
    well between him and the surveyors&rsquo; camp, lest the cook should glance
    round, and, noticing the increased bulk of his load, get some new ideas concerning
    mental aberration.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Nearly every bushman has at least one superstition, or notion, that lasts
    his time&mdash;as nearly every bushman has at least one dictionary word which
    lasts him all his life. Brummy had a gloomy notion&mdash;Lord knows how he
    got it!&mdash;that he should &rsquo;a&rsquo; gone on the boards if his people
    hadn&rsquo;t been so ignorant. He reckoned that he had the face and cut of
    an actor, could mimic any man&rsquo;s voice, and had wonderful control over
    his features. They came to a notoriously &ldquo;hungry&rdquo; station, where
    there was a Scottish manager and storekeeper. Brummy went up to &ldquo;government
    house&rdquo; in his own proper person, had a talk with the storekeeper, spoke
    of a sick mate, and got some flour and meat. They camped down the creek,
    and next morning Brummy started to shave himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever are you a-doin&rsquo; of, Brummy?&rdquo; gasped Swampy in
    great astonishment.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait and see,&rdquo; growled Brummy, with awful impressiveness, as
    if he were going to cut Swampy&rsquo;s throat after he&rsquo;d finished shaving.
    He shaved off his beard and whiskers, put on a hat and coat belonging to
    Swampy, changed his voice, dropped his shoulders, and went limping up to
    the station on a game leg. He saw the cook and got some &ldquo;brownie,&rdquo; a
    bit of cooked meat and a packet of baking powder. Then he saw the storekeeper
    and approached the tobacco question. Sandy looked at him and listened with
    some slight show of interest, then he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh that&rsquo;s all right now! But ye needn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; troublt
    shavin&rsquo; yer beard&mdash;the cold weather&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on! An&rsquo; yer
    mate&rsquo;s duds don&rsquo;t suit ye&mdash;they&rsquo;re too sma&rsquo;;
    an&rsquo; yer game leg doesn&rsquo;t fit ye either&mdash;it takes a lot o&rsquo; practice.
    Ha&rsquo; ye got ony tea an&rsquo; sugar? &ldquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy must have touched something responsive in that old Scot somewhere,
    but his lack of emotion upset Brummy somewhat, or else an old deep-rooted
    superstition had been severely shaken. Anyway he let Swampy do the cadging
    for several days thereafter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>But one bad season they were very hard up indeed&mdash;even for Brummy and
    Swampy. They&rsquo;d tramped a long hungry track, and had only met a few
    wretched jackeroos, driven out of the cities by hard times, and tramping
    hopelessly west. They were out of tobacco, and their trousers were so hopelessly &ldquo;gone&rdquo;  behind
    that when they went to cadge at a place where there was a woman they were
    moved to back and sidle and edge away again&mdash;and neither Brummy nor
    Swampy was over fastidious in matters of dress or personal appearance. It
    was absolutely necessary to earn a pound or two, so they decided to go to
    work for a couple of weeks. It wouldn&rsquo;t hurt them, and then there was
    the novelty of it.</p>
  <p>They struck West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, and the boss happened to want
    a rouseabout to pick up wool and sweep the floor for the shearers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I can put&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;of you on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Fix
    it up between yourselves and go to work in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy and Swampy went apart to talk it over.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here! Brum, old man,&rdquo; said Swampy, with great heartiness,  &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    been mates for a long while now, an&rsquo; shared an&rsquo; shared alike.
    You&rsquo;ve allers acted straight to me an&rsquo; I want to do the fair
    thing by you.&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;don&rsquo;t want to stand in&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;light.
    You take the job an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll be satisfied with a pair of pants out
    of it and a bit o&rsquo; tobacco now an&rsquo; agen. There yer are! I can&rsquo;t
    say no fairer than that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Brummy, resentfully, &ldquo;an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll
    always be throwin&rsquo; it up to me afterwards that I done you out of a
    job!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Swampy, hurriedly. &ldquo;But
    since you&rsquo;re so blasted touchy and suspicious about it,&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;take
    this job an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll take the next that turns up. How&rsquo;ll
    that suit you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy thought resentfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s settle it
    and have done with this damned sentimental tommy-rot. I&rsquo;ll tell you
    what I&rsquo;ll do&mdash;I&rsquo;ll give you the job and take my chance.
    The boss might want another man to-morrow. Now, are you satisfied?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But Swampy didn&rsquo;t look grateful or happy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled Brummy, &ldquo;of all the &mdash;&mdash; I ever
    travelled with you&rsquo;re the &mdash;&mdash;. What do you want anyway?
    What&rsquo;ll satisfy you? That&rsquo;s all I want to know. Hey?&mdash;can&rsquo;t
    yer speak?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s toss up for it,&rdquo; said Swampy, sulkily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Brummy, with a big oath, and he felt in his
    pocket for two old pennies he had. But Swampy had got a suspicion somehow
    that one of those pennies had two heads on it, and he wasn&rsquo;t sure that
    the other hadn&rsquo;t two tails&mdash;also, he suspected Brummy of some
    skill in &ldquo;palming,&rdquo; so he picked up a chip from the wood-heap,
    spat on it, and spun it into the air.  &ldquo;Sing out!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;wet
    or dry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dry,&rdquo; said Brummy, promptly. He had a theory that the wet side
    of the chip, being presumably heaviest, was more likely to fall downwards;
    but this time it was &ldquo;wet&rdquo; up three times in succession. Brummy
    ignored Swampy&rsquo;s hand thrown out in hearty congratulation; and next
    morning he went to work in the shed. Swampy camped down the river, and Brummy
    supplied him with a cheap pair of moleskin trousers, tucker and tobacco.
    The shed cut out within three weeks and the two sundowners took the track
    again, Brummy with two pounds odd in his pocket&mdash;he having negotiated
    his cheque at the shed.</p>
  <p>But now there was suspicion, envy, and distrust in the hearts of those two
    wayfarers. Brummy was now a bloated capitalist, and proud, and anxious to
    get rid of Swampy&mdash;at least Swampy thought so. He thought that the least
    that Brummy might have done was to have shared the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; with
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said reproachfully, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve
    shared and shared alike, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We never shared money,&rdquo; said Brummy, decidedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you think I want yer blasted money?&rdquo; retorted Swampy, indignantly. &ldquo;When
    did I ever ask yer for a sprat? Tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have got it if you had asked,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    uncompromisingly. &ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; with vehemence. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
    I keep yer in tobacco and buy yer gory pants? What are you naggin&rsquo; about
    anyway?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Swampy, &ldquo;all I was goin&rsquo; to say was
    that yer might let me carry one of them quids in case you lost one&mdash;yer
    know you&rsquo;re careless and lose things; or in case anything happened
    to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to lose it&mdash;if that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s
    fretting you,&rdquo; said Brummy, &ldquo;and there ain&rsquo;t nothing going
    to happen to me&mdash;and don&rsquo;t you forget it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the thanks I get for givin&rsquo; yer my gory job,&rdquo; said
    Swampy, savagely. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be sich a soft fool agen, I can tell
    yer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Brummy was silent, and Swampy dropped behind. He brooded darkly, and it&rsquo;s
    a bad thing for a man to brood in the bush. He was reg&rsquo;lar disgusted
    with Brummy. He&rsquo;d allers acted straight to him, and Brummy had acted
    like a  &ldquo;cow.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stand it no longer; but he&rsquo;d
    have some satisfaction. He wouldn&rsquo;t be a fool. If Brummy was mean skunk
    enough to act to a mate like that, Swampy would be even with him; he would
    wait till Brummy was asleep, collar the stuff, and clear. It was his job,
    anyway, and the money was his by rights. He&rsquo;d have his rights.</p>
  <p>Brummy, who carried the billy, gave Swampy a long tramp before he camped
    and made a fire. They had tea in silence, and smoked moodily apart until
    Brummy turned in. They usually slept on the ground, with a few leaves under
    them, or on the sand where there was any, each wrapped in his own blankets,
    and with their spare clothes, or rags rather, for pillows. Presently Swampy
    turned in and pretended to sleep, but he lay awake watching, and listening
    to Brummy&rsquo;s breathing. When he thought it was safe he moved cautiously
    and slipped his hand under Brummy&rsquo;s head, but Brummy&rsquo;s old pocket-book&mdash;in
    which he carried some dirty old letters in a woman&rsquo;s handwriting&mdash;was
    not there. All next day Swampy watched Brummy sharply every time he put his
    hands into his pockets, to try and find out in which pocket he kept his money.
    Brummy seemed very cheerful and sociable, even considerate, to his mate all
    day, and Swampy pretended to be happy. They yarned more than they had done
    for many a day. Brummy was a heavy sleeper, and that night Swampy went over
    him carefully and felt all his pockets, but without success. Next day Brummy
    seemed in high spirits&mdash;they were nearing Bourke, where they intended
    to loaf round the pubs for a week or two. On the third night Swampy waited
    till about midnight, and then searched Brummy, every inch of him he could
    get at, and tickled him with a straw of grass till he turned over, and ran
    his hands over the other side of him, and over his feet (Brummy slept with
    his socks on), and looked in his boots, and in the billy and in the tucker-bags,
    and felt in every tuft of grass round the camp, and under every bush, and
    down a hollow stump, and up a hollow log: but there was no pocket-book. Brummy
    couldn&rsquo;t have lost the money and kept it dark&mdash;he&rsquo;d have
    gone back to look for it at once. Perhaps he&rsquo;d thrown away the book
    and sewn the money in his clothes somewhere. Swampy crept back to him and
    felt the lining of his hat, and was running his hand over Brummy&rsquo;s
    chest when Brummy suddenly started to snore, and Swampy desisted without
    loss of time. He crept back to bed, breathing short, and thought hard. It
    struck him that there was something aggressive about that snore. He began
    to suspect that Brummy was up to his little game, and it pained him.</p>
  <p>Next morning Brummy was decidedly frivolous. At any other time Swampy would
    have put it down to a &ldquo;touch o&rsquo; the sun,&rdquo; but now he felt
    a growing conviction that Brummy knew what he&rsquo;d been up to the last
    three nights, and the more he thought of it the more it pained him&mdash;till
    at last he could stand it no longer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Brummy,&rdquo; he said frankly, &ldquo;where the hell
    do you keep that flamin&rsquo; stuff o&rsquo; yourn? I been tryin&rsquo; to
    git at it ever since we left West-o&rsquo;-Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I know you have, Swampy,&rdquo; said Brummy, affectionately&mdash;as
    if he considered that Swampy had done his best in the interests of mateship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;<i>knowed</i>&nbsp;yer knowed!&rdquo; exclaimed Swampy, triumphantly. &ldquo;But
    where the blazes did yer put it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Under&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;head, Swampy, old man,&rdquo; said Brummy,
    cheerfully.</p>
  <p>Swampy was hurt now. He commented in the language that used to be used by
    the bullock-punchers of the good days as they pranced up and down by their
    teams and lammed into the bullocks with saplings and crow-bars, and called
    on them to lift a heavy load out of a bog in the bed of a muddy creek.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, Swampy!&rdquo; said Brummy, soothingly, as his mate paused
    and tried to remember worse oaths. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t your fault.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But they parted at Bourke. Swampy had allers acted straight ter Brummy&mdash;share &rsquo;n&rsquo; share
    alike. He&rsquo;d do as much for a mate as any other man, an&rsquo;  put
    up with as much from a mate. He had put up with a lot from Brummy: he&rsquo;d
    picked him up on the track and learned him all he knowed; Brummy&mdash;would
    have starved many a time if it hadn&rsquo;t been for Swampy; Swampy had learned
    him how to  &ldquo;battle.&rdquo; He&rsquo;d stick to Brummy yet, but he
    couldn&rsquo;t stand ingratitude. He hated low cunnin&rsquo; an&rsquo; suspicion,
    and when a gory mate got suspicious of his own old mate and wouldn&rsquo;t
    trust him, an&rsquo; took to plantin&rsquo; his crimson money&mdash;it was
    time to leave him.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASketchofMateship"></a>A Sketch of Mateship</b></h2>
  <p>Bill&nbsp;and Jim, professional shearers, were coming into Bourke from the
    Queensland side. They were horsemen and had two packhorses. At the last camp
    before Bourke Jim&rsquo;s packhorse got disgusted and home-sick during the
    night and started back for the place where he was foaled. Jim was little
    more than a new-chum jackeroo; he was no bushman and generally got lost when
    he went down the next gully. Bill was a bushman, so it was decided that he
    should go back to look for the horse.</p>
  <p>Now Bill was going to sell his packhorse, a well-bred mare, in Bourke, and
    he was anxious to get her into the yards before the horse sales were over;
    this was to be the last day of the sales. Jim was the best  &ldquo;barracker&rdquo; of
    the two; he had great imagination; he was a very entertaining story-teller
    and conversationalist in social life, and a glib and a most impressive liar
    in business, so it was decided that he should hurry on into Bourke with the
    mare and sell her for Bill. Seven pounds, reserve.</p>
  <p>Next day Bill turned up with the missing horse and saw Jim standing against
    a veranda-post of the Carriers&rsquo; Arms, with his hat down over his eyes,
    and thoughtfully spitting in the dust. Bill rode over to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ullo, Bill. I see you got him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I got him.&rsquo;&rsquo; Pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d yer find him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout ten mile back. Near Ford&rsquo;s Bridge. He was just
    feedin&rsquo;  along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Pause. Jim shifted his feet and spat in the dust.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bill at last. &ldquo;How did you get on, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, all right,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I sold the mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;How much did she fetch?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eight quid;&rdquo; then, rousing himself a little and showing some
    emotion, &ldquo;An&rsquo; I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid for her if
    I hadn&rsquo;t been a dam&rsquo; fool.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s good enough,&rdquo; said Bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten quid if I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; waited.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use cryin&rsquo;. Eight quid is good enough.
    Did you get the stuff?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. They parted all right. If I hadn&rsquo;t been such a dam&rsquo; fool
    an&rsquo; rushed it, there was a feller that would &rsquo;a&rsquo; given
    ten quid for that mare.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t break yer back about it,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;Eight
    is good enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. But I could &rsquo;a&rsquo; got ten,&rdquo; said Jim, languidly,
    putting his hand in his pocket.</p>
  <p>Pause. Bill sat waiting for him to hand over the money; but Jim withdrew
    his hand empty, stretched, and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah, well, Bill, I done it in. Lend us a couple o&rsquo; notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jim had been drinking and gambling all night and he&rsquo;d lost the eight
    pounds as well as his own money.</p>
  <p>Bill didn&rsquo;t explode. What was the use? He should have known that Jim
    wasn&rsquo;t to be trusted with money in town. It was he who had been the
    fool. He sighed and lent Jim a pound, and they went in to have a drink.</p>
  <p>Now it strikes me that if this had happened in a civilized country (like
    England) Bill would have had Jim arrested and jailed for larceny as a bailee,
    or embezzlement, or whatever it was. And would Bill or Jim or the world have
    been any better for it?</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="OntheTuckerTrack"></a>On the Tucker Track</b><br>
      <b>A Steelman Story</b></h2>
  <p>Steelman&nbsp;and Smith, professional wanderers from New Zealand, took a
    run over to Australia one year to have a look at the country, and drifted
    out back, and played cards and &ldquo;headin&rsquo; &rsquo;em&rdquo; at the
    shearing-sheds (while pretending to be strangers to each other), and sold
    eye-water and unpatented medicine, and worked the tucker tracks. They struck
    a streak of bad luck at West-o&rsquo;-Sunday Station, where they were advised
    (by the boss and about fifty excited shearers) to go east, and not to stop
    till they reached the coast. They were tramping along the track towards Bourke;
    they were very hard up and had to &ldquo;battle&rdquo; for tucker and tobacco
    along the track. They came to a lonely shanty, about two camps west of Bourke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn off into the scrub and strike the track the other
    side of the shanty and come back to it,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;You
    see, if they see us coming into Bourke they&rsquo;ll say to themselves, &lsquo;Oh,
    we&rsquo;re never likely to see these chaps again,&rsquo; and they won&rsquo;t
    give us anything, or, perhaps, only a pinch of tea or sugar in a big lump
    of paper. There&rsquo;s some women that, can never see a tucker-bag, even
    if you hold it right under their noses. But if they see us going out back
    they&rsquo;ll reckon that we&rsquo;ll get a shed likely as not, and we&rsquo;ll
    be sure to call there with our cheques coming back. I hope the old man&rsquo;s
    got the lumbago, or sciatica, or something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because whenever I see an old man poking round the place on a stick
    I always make for him straight and inquire about his trouble; and no matter
    what complaint he&rsquo;s got, my old man suffered from it for years. It&rsquo;s
    pretty hard graft listening to an old man with a pet leg, but I find it pays;
    and I always finish up by advising him to try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil. Perhaps
    he&rsquo;s been trying it for years, but that doesn&rsquo;t matter; the consultation
    works out all right all the same, and there&rsquo;s never been a remedy tried
    yet but I&rsquo;ve got another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got a lot of Maori and blackfellow remedies in my mind,
    and when they fail I can fall back on the Chinese; and if that isn&rsquo;t
    enough I&rsquo;ve got a list of my grandmother&rsquo;s remedies that she
    wrote down for me when I was leaving home, and I kept it for a curiosity.
    It took her three days to write them, and I reckon they&rsquo;ll fill the
    bill.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want a shave. You look better with that stubble on.
    You needn&rsquo;t say anything; just stand by and wear your usual expression,
    and if they ask me what&rsquo;s the matter with my mate I&rsquo;ll fix up
    a disease for you to have, and get something extra on your account, poor
    beggar!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I wish we had a chap with us that could sing a bit and run the gamut
    on a fiddle or something. With a sickly-looking fish like you to stand by
    and look interesting and die slowly of consumption all the time, and me to
    do the talking, we&rsquo;d be able to travel from one end of the bush to
    the other and live on the fat of the land. I wouldn&rsquo;t cure you for
    a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They reached the shanty, and there, sure enough, was an old man pottering
    round with a list to starboard. He was working with a hoe inside a low paling
    fence round a sort of garden. Steelman and Smith stopped outside the fence. &ldquo;Good
    day, boss!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So far it was satisfactory.</p>
  <p>He was a little man, with a wiry, red beard. He might have been a Scandinavian.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You seem to be a bit lame,&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;Hurt your
    foot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old thing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Steelman, &ldquo;lumbago, I suppose? My father suffered
    cruel from it for years.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, moving closer to the fence. &ldquo;It
    ain&rsquo;t in me back; the trouble&rsquo;s with me leg.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;One a bit shorter than the other?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes. It seems to be wearin&rsquo; a bit shorter. I must see
    to it. &ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hip disease, perhaps?&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;A brother o&rsquo; mine
    had&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw, it&rsquo;s not in the hip,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;My
    leg&rsquo;s gone at the knee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh! stiff joint; I know what that is. Had a touch of it once myself.
    An uncle of mine was nearly crippled with it. He used to use St Jacob&rsquo;s
    oil. Ever try St Jacob&rsquo;s oil?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naw,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;not that I know of. I&rsquo;ve
    used linseed oil though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Linseed oil!&rdquo; said Steelman; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never heard
    of that for stiff knee. How do you use it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Use it raw,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Raw linseed oil; I&rsquo;ve
    rubbed it in, and I&rsquo;ve soaked me leg in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Soaked your leg in it!&rdquo; said Steelman. &ldquo;And did it do
    it any good?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, it seems to preserve it&mdash;keeps it from warping, and it
    wears better&mdash;and it makes it heavier. It seemed a bit too light before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Steelman nudged Smith under cover of the palings. The old man was evidently
    a bit ratty.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well I hope your leg will soon be all right, boss,&rdquo; said Steelman.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think
    there&rsquo;s much hope. I suppose you want some tucker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; said Steelman, rather taken aback by the old man&rsquo;s
    sudden way of putting it. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hard up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, come along to the house and I&rsquo;ll see if I can get yer
    something,&rdquo; said the old man; and they walked along outside the fence,
    and he hobbled along inside, till he came to a little gate at the corner.
    He opened the gate and stumped out. He had a wooden leg. He wore his trouser-leg
    down over it, and the palings had hidden the bottom from Steelman and Smith.</p>
  <p>He wanted them to stay to dinner, but Steelman didn&rsquo;t feel comfortable,
    and thanked him, and said they&rsquo;d rather be getting on (Steelman always
    spoke for Smith); so the old man gave them some cooked meat, bread, and a
    supply of tea and sugar. Steelman watched his face very close, but he never
    moved a muscle. But when they looked back he was leaning on his hoe, and
    seemed to be shaking.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Took you back a bit, Steely, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; suggested Smith.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you make that out?&rdquo; snorted Steelman, turning on him
    suddenly. &ldquo;I knew a carpenter who used to soak his planes in raw linseed
    oil to preserve them and give them weight. There&rsquo;s nothing funny about
    that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Smith rubbed his head.</p>

    me that the world was ended&mdash;an&rsquo; he hangs over the bar an&rsquo; chews
    me lug, an&rsquo; tries to speak, an&rsquo; breaks off inter a sort o&rsquo; low
    shriek, like a terrified woman, an&rsquo; he says, &ldquo;For Mother o&rsquo; Christ&rsquo;s
    sake, giv&rsquo; me a drink!&rdquo; An&rsquo; what am I to do? I bin there
    meself. I knows what the horrors is. He mighter blued his cheque at the last
    shanty. But what am I ter do? I put it ter you. If I let him go he might
    hang hisself ter the nex&rsquo;  leanin&rsquo; tree.</p>
  <p>What&rsquo;s a drink? yer might arst&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind a drink or
    two; but when it comes to half a dozen in a day it mounts up, I can tell
    yer. Drinks is sixpence here&mdash;I have to pay for it, an&rsquo; pay carriage
    on it. It&rsquo;s all up ter me in the end. I used sometimes ter think it
    was lucky I wasn&rsquo;t west o&rsquo; the sixpenny line, where I&rsquo;d
    lose a shillin&rsquo; on every drink I give away.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; supposen a sundowner comes along smokin&rsquo; tea-leaves, an&rsquo; ses
    ter me, &ldquo;Look her, boss! me an&rsquo; my mate ain&rsquo;t had a smoke
    for three days!&rdquo; What&rsquo;s a man ter do? I put it ter you! I&rsquo;m
    a heavy smoker meself, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve known what it is to be without
    a smoke on the track. But &ldquo;nail-rod&rdquo; is ninepence a stick out
    here, an&rsquo; I have ter pay carriage. It all mounts up, I can tell yer.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; supposen Ole King Billy an&rsquo; his ole black gin comes round
    at holiday time and squats on the verander, an&rsquo; blarneys an&rsquo; wheedles
    and whines and argues like a hundred Jews an&rsquo; ole Irishwomen put tergether,
    an&rsquo; accuses me o&rsquo; takin&rsquo; his blarsted country from him,
    an&rsquo; makes me an&rsquo; the missus laugh; an&rsquo; we gives him a bottl&rsquo;er
    rum an&rsquo; a bag of grub ter get rid of him an&rsquo; his rotten ole scarecrow
    tribe&mdash;It all tells up. I was allers soft on the blacks, an&rsquo;,
    beside, a ole gin nursed me an&rsquo; me mother when I was born, an&rsquo; saved
    me blessed life&mdash;not that that mounts to much. But it all tells up,
    an&rsquo; I got me licence ter pay. An&rsquo; some bloody skunk goes an&rsquo; informs
    on me for supplyin&rsquo; the haboriginalls with intossicatin&rsquo; liquor,
    an&rsquo; I have ter pay a fine an&rsquo; risk me licence. But what&rsquo;s
    a man ter do?</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; three or four herrin&rsquo;-gutted jackeroos comes along about
    dinner-time, when the table&rsquo;s set and the cookin&rsquo; smellin&rsquo;  from
    the kichen, with their belts done up three holes, an&rsquo; not the price
    of a feed on &rsquo;em. What&rsquo;s a man ter do? I&rsquo;ve known what
    it is ter do a perish on the track meself. It&rsquo;s not the tucker I think
    on. I don&rsquo;t care a damn for that. When the shearers come every one
    is free to go inter the kitchin an&rsquo; forage for hisself when he feels
    hungry&mdash;so long as he pays for his drink. But the jackeroos can&rsquo;t
    pay for drinks, an&rsquo; I have ter pay carriage on the flour an&rsquo; tea
    an&rsquo;  sugar an&rsquo; groceries&mdash;an&rsquo; it all tells up by the
    end o&rsquo; the year.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; a straight chap that knows me gets a job to take a flock o&rsquo; sheep
    or a mob o&rsquo; cattle ter the bloomin&rsquo; Gulf, or South Australia,
    or somewheers&mdash;an&rsquo; loses one of his horses goin&rsquo; out ter
    take charge, an&rsquo; borrers eight quid from me ter buy another. He&rsquo;ll
    turn up agen in a year or two an&rsquo; most likely want ter make me take
    twenty quid for that eight&mdash;an&rsquo; make everybody about the place
    blind drunk&mdash;but I&rsquo;ve got ter wait, an&rsquo; the wine an&rsquo;  sperit
    merchants an&rsquo; the brewery won&rsquo;t. They know I can&rsquo;t do without
    liquor in the place.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; lars&rsquo; rains Jimmy Nowlett, the bullick-driver, gets bogged
    over his axle-trees back there on the Blacksoil Plains between two flooded
    billerbongs, an&rsquo; prays till the country steams an&rsquo;  his soul&rsquo;s
    busted, an&rsquo; his throat like a lime-kiln. He taps a keg o&rsquo; rum
    or beer ter keep his throat in workin&rsquo; order. I don&rsquo;t mind that
    at all, but him an&rsquo; his mates git flood-bound for near a week, an&rsquo; broach
    more kegs, an&rsquo; go on a howlin&rsquo; spree in ther mud, an&rsquo; spill
    mor&rsquo;n they swipe, an&rsquo; leave a tarpaulin off a load, an&rsquo; the
    flour gets wet, an&rsquo; the sugar runs out of the bags like syrup, an&rsquo;&mdash; What&rsquo;s
    a feller ter do? Do yer expect me to set the law outer Jimmy? I&rsquo;ve
    knowed him all my life, an&rsquo; he knowed my father afore I was born. He&rsquo;s
    been on the roads this forty year, till he&rsquo;s as thin as a rat, and
    as poor as a myall black; an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s got a family ter keep back
    there in Bourke. No, I have ter pay for it in the end, an&rsquo; it all mounts
    up, I can tell yer.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; suppose some poor devil of a new-chum black sheep comes along,
    staggerin&rsquo; from one side of the track to the other, and spoutin&rsquo; poetry;
    dyin&rsquo; o&rsquo; heat or fever, or heartbreak an&rsquo; home-sickness,
    or a life o&rsquo; disserpation he&rsquo;d led in England, an&rsquo; without
    a sprat on him, an&rsquo;  no claim on the bush; an&rsquo; I ketches him
    in me arms as he stumbles inter the bar, an&rsquo; he wants me ter hold him
    up while he turns English inter Greek for me. An&rsquo; I put him ter bed,
    an&rsquo; he gits worse, an&rsquo; I have ter send the buggy twenty mile
    for a doctor&mdash;an&rsquo; pay him. An&rsquo; the jackeroo gits worse,
    an&rsquo; has ter be watched an&rsquo; nursed an&rsquo; held down sometimes;
    an&rsquo; he raves about his home an&rsquo;  mother in England, an&rsquo; the
    blarsted University that he was eddicated at&mdash;an&rsquo; a woman&mdash;an&rsquo; somethin&rsquo; that
    sounds like poetry in French; an&rsquo; he upsets my missus a lot, an&rsquo; makes
    her blubber. An&rsquo; he dies, an&rsquo; I have ter pay a man ter bury him
    (an&rsquo; knock up a sort o&rsquo; fence round the grave arterwards ter
    keep the stock out), an&rsquo; send the buggy agen for a parson, an&rsquo;&mdash;Well,
    what&rsquo;s a man ter do? I couldn&rsquo;t let him wander away an&rsquo; die
    like a dog in the scrub, an&rsquo; be shoved underground like a dog, too,
    if his body was ever found. The Government might pay ter bury him, but there
    ain&rsquo;t never been a pauper funeral from my house yet, an&rsquo; there
    won&rsquo;t be one if I can help it&mdash;except it be meself.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; then there&rsquo;s the bother goin&rsquo; through his papers to
    try an&rsquo; find out who he was an&rsquo; where his friends is. An&rsquo; I
    have ter get the missus to write a letter to his people, an&rsquo; we have
    ter make up lies about how he died ter make it easier for &rsquo;em. An&rsquo; goin&rsquo; through
    his letters, the missus comes across a portrait an&rsquo; a locket of hair,
    an&rsquo; letters from his mother an&rsquo; sisters an&rsquo; girl; an&rsquo; they
    upset her, an&rsquo; she blubbers agin, an&rsquo; gits sentimental-like she
    useter long ago when we was first married.</p>
  <p>There was one bit of poetry&mdash;I forgit it now&mdash;that that there
    jackeroo kep&rsquo; sayin&rsquo; over an&rsquo; over agen till it buzzed
    in me head; an&rsquo;, weeks after, I&rsquo;d ketch the missus mutterin&rsquo; it
    to herself in the kitchen till I thought she was goin&rsquo; ratty.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; we gets a letter from the jackeroo&rsquo;s friends that puts us
    to a lot more bother. I hate havin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; to do with letters.
    An&rsquo; someone&rsquo;s sure to say he was lambed down an&rsquo; cleaned
    out an&rsquo;  poisoned with bad bush liquor at my place. It&rsquo;s almost
    enough ter make a man wish there was a recorin&rsquo; angel.</p>
  <p>An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s the end of it? I got the blazin&rsquo; bailiff in
    the place now! I can&rsquo;t shot him out because he&rsquo;s a decent, hard-up,
    poor devil from Bourke, with consumption or somethin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s
    been talkin&rsquo; to the missus about his missus an&rsquo; kids; an&rsquo; I
    see no chance of gittin&rsquo;  rid of him, unless the shearers come along
    with their cheques from West-o&rsquo;-Sunday nex&rsquo; week and act straight
    by me. Like as not I&rsquo;ll have ter roll up me swag an&rsquo; take the
    track meself in the end. They say publicans are damned, an&rsquo; I think
    so, too; an&rsquo; I wish I&rsquo;d bin operated on before ever I seen a
    pub.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearersDream"></a>The Shearer&rsquo;s Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Mitchell&nbsp;and I rolled up our swags after New Year and started to tramp
    west. It had been a very bad season after a long drought. Old Baldy Thompson
    had only shorn a few bales of grass-seed and burrs, so he said, and thought
    of taking the track himself; but we hoped to get on shearing stragglers at
    West-o&rsquo;-Sunday or one of the stations of the Hungerford track.</p>
  <p>It was very hot weather, so we started after sunset, intending to travel
    all night. We crossed the big billabong, and were ploughing through the dust
    and sand towards West Bourke, when a buggy full of city girls and swells
    passed by. They were part of a theatrical company on tour in the Back-Blocks,
    and some local Johnnies. They&rsquo;d been driven out to see an artesian
    bore, or wool-shed, or something. The horses swerved, and jerked a little
    squawk out of one of the girls. Then another said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow-w! Two old swaggies. He! he! he!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I glanced at Mitchell to see if he was hit, and caught his head down; but
    he pulled himself up and pretended to hitch his swag into an easier position.</p>
  <p>About a hundred yards further on he gave me a side look and said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did that touch you, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; I said, and I laughed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re more to
    be pitied than blamed. It&rsquo;s their ignorance. In the first place, we&rsquo;re
    not two old tramps, as they think. We are professional shearers; and the
    Australian shearers are about the most independent and intelligent class
    of men in the world. We&rsquo;ve got more genius in one of our little fingers
    than there is in the whole of that wagonette-load of diddle-daddle and fiddle-faddle
    and giggles. Their intellects are on a level with the rotten dramas they
    travel with, and their lives about as false. They are slaves to the public,
    and their home is the pub-parlour, with sickly, senseless Johnnies to shout
    suppers and drink for them and lend their men money. If one of those girls
    is above the average, how she must despise those Johnnies&mdash;and the life!
    She must feel a greater contempt for them than the private-barmaid does for
    the boozer she cleans out. He gets his drink and some enjoyment, anyhow.
    And how she must loathe the life she leads! And what&rsquo;s the end of it
    as often as not? I remember once, when I was a boy, I was walking out with
    two aunts of mine&mdash;they&rsquo;re both dead now. God rest their fussy,
    innocent old souls!&mdash;and one of &rsquo;em said suddenly, &lsquo;Look!
    Quick, Jack! There&rsquo;s Maggie So-and-So, the great actress.&rsquo; And
    I looked and saw a woman training vines in a porch. It seemed like seeing
    an angel to me, and I never forgot her as she was then. The diggers used
    to go miles out of town to meet the coach that brought her, and take the
    horses out and drag it in, and throw gold in her lap, and worship her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The last time I was in Sydney I saw her sitting in the back parlour
    of a third-rate pub. She was dying of dropsy and couldn&rsquo;t move from
    her chair. She showed me a portrait of herself as I remembered her, and talked
    quite seriously about going on the stage again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, our home is about two thousand miles wide, and the world&rsquo;s
    our stage. If the worst comes to the worst we can always get tucker and wood
    and water for nothing. If we&rsquo;re camping at a job in a tent there&rsquo;s
    no house-cleaning to bother us. All we&rsquo;ve got to do when the camp gets
    too dirty is to shift the tent to a fresh place. We&rsquo;ve got time to
    think and we&rsquo;re free.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But then, agen,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s the world&rsquo;s
    point of view to be considered. Some day I might be flashing past in a buggy
    or saloon-carriage&mdash;or, the chances are it will be you&mdash;and you
    might look out the window and see an old swaggy tramping along in the dust,
    or camped under a strip of calico in the rain in the scrub. (And it might
    be me&mdash;old Mitchell&mdash;that really wrote your books, only the world
    won&rsquo;t know it.) And then you&rsquo;ll realize what a wretched, miserable
    life it was. We never realize the miseries of life till we look back&mdash;the
    mistakes and miseries that had to be and couldn&rsquo;t be helped. It&rsquo;s
    all luck&mdash;luck and chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But those girls seemed to have gravelled Mitchell, and he didn&rsquo;t seem
    able to talk himself round. He tramped on, brooding for a while, and then
    suddenly he said:</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look here, Harry! Those girls are giving a dance to-night, and if
    I liked to go back to Bourke and tog up and go to the dance I could pick
    out the prettiest, dance with her all the evening, and take her for a stroll
    afterwards, old tramp as they thought me. I&rsquo;ve lived&mdash;but it wouldn&rsquo;t
    be worth my while now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d seen Jack in a mood like this before, and thought it best to say
    nothing. Perhaps the terrible heat had affected him a little. We walked on
    in silence until we came to the next billabong. &ldquo;Best boil the billy
    here, Harry,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and have some tea before we go
    any further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I got some sticks together and made a fire and put the billy on. The country
    looked wretched&mdash;like the ghost of a burnt-out land&mdash;in the moonlight.
    The banks of the creek were like ashes, the thin, gnarled gum-bush seemed
    dry-rotting fast, and in many places the surface of the ground was cracked
    in squares where it had shrunk in the drought. In the bed of the creek was
    a narrow gutter of water that looked like bad milk.</p>
  <p>Mitchell sat on his swag, with his pint of tea on the ground by his foot,
    and chewed his pipe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up, Jack?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Have you got the blues?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, yes, Harry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally dull
    the first day on the track. The first day is generally the worst, anywhere
    or anytime&mdash;except, perhaps, when you&rsquo;re married. . . . I got&mdash;well,
    I got thinking of the time when a woman&rsquo;s word could have hurt me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Just then one of the &ldquo;travellers&rdquo; who were camped a bit up the
    creek suddenly commenced to sing. It was a song called &ldquo;The Shearer&rsquo;s
    Dream,&rdquo; and I suppose the buggy of girls, or the conversation they
    started, reminded him of it. He started his verses and most of his lines
    with a howl; and there were unexpected howls all through the song, and it
    wailed off, just as unexpectedly, in places where there was no pathos that
    I could see:</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Oh, I dreamt I shore in a shearer&rsquo;s shed, and
    it was a dream of joy,<br>
    For every one of the rouseabouts was a girl dressed up as a boy&mdash;<br>
    Dressed up like a page in a pantomime, and the prettiest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had flaxen hair, they had coal-black hair&mdash;and every shade between.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Every&rdquo; with sudden and great energy, a long drop on to &ldquo;shade,&rdquo; and
    a wail of intense sadness and regret running on into &ldquo;between,&rdquo; the
    dirge reaching its wailsomest in the &ldquo;tween&rdquo; in every case.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;The shed was cooled by electric fans that was over every &ldquo;shoot&rdquo;;<br>
    The pens was of polished ma-ho-gany, and ev&rsquo;rything else to suit;<br>
    The huts was fixed with spring-mattresses, and the tucker was simply grand,<br>
    And every Right by the biller-bong we darnced to a German band.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus, boys!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was short, plump girls, there was tall, slim girls,
    and the handsomest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They was four-foot-five, they was six-foot high, and hevery size between.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;Our pay was the wool on the jumbucks&rsquo; backs, so
    we shore till all was blue&mdash;<br>
    The sheep was washed afore they was shore (and the rams was scented too);<br>
    And we all of us cried when the shed cut out, in spite of the long, hot days,<br>
    For hevery hour them girls waltzed in with whisky and beer on tr-a-a-a-ys!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Chorus! you &mdash;&mdash;!</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;They had kind grey eyes, they had coal-black eyes, and
    the grandest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had plump pink hands, they had slim white hands, and hevery shape be-tw-e-e-n.</p>
  <p class="note">&ldquo;There was three of them girls to every chap, and as
    jealous as they could be&mdash;&ldquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ow! you &mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The singer&rsquo;s voice or memory seemed suddenly to have failed him at
    this point, but whether his mates hit him on the back of the head with a
    tomahawk, or only choked him, I do not know. Mitchell was inclined to think,
    from the sound of it, that they choked him.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLostSoulsHotel"></a>The Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel</b></h2>
  <p>Hungerford road, February. One hundred and thirty miles of heavy reddish
    sand, bordered by dry, hot scrubs. Dense cloud of hot dust. Four wool-teams
    passing through a gate in a &ldquo;rabbit proof&rdquo; fence which crosses
    the road. Clock, clock, clock of wheels and rattle and clink of chains, crack
    of whips and explosions of Australian language. Bales and every thing else
    coated with dust. Stink of old axle-grease and tarpaulins. Tyres hot enough
    to fry chops on: bows and chains so hot that it&rsquo;s a wonder they do
    not burn through the bullock&rsquo;s hides. Water lukewarm in blistered kegs
    slung behind the wagons. Bullocks dragging along as only bullocks do. Wheels
    ploughing through the deep sand, and the load lurching from side to side.
    Half-way on a &ldquo;dry-stretch&rdquo;  of seventeen miles. Big &ldquo;tank&rdquo; full
    of good water through the scrub to the right, but it is a private tank and
    a boundary-rider is shepherding it. Mulga scrub and sparse, spiky undergrowth.</p>
  <p>The carriers camp for dinner and boil their billies while the bullocks droop
    under their yokes in the blazing heat; one or two lie down and the leaders
    drag and twist themselves round under a dead tree, under the impression that
    there is shade there. The carriers look like Red Indians, with the masks
    of red dust &ldquo;bound&rdquo; with sweat on their faces, but there is an
    unhealthy-looking, whitish space round their eyes, caused by wiping away
    the blinding dust, sweat, and flies. The dry sticks burn with a pale flame
    and an almost invisible thin pale blue smoke. The sun&rsquo;s heat dancing
    and dazzling across every white fence-post, sandhill, or light-coloured object
    in the distance.</p>
  <p>One man takes off his boot and sock, empties half a pint of sand out of
    them, and pulls up his trouser-leg. His leg is sheathed to the knee in dust
    and sweat; he absently scrapes it with his knife, and presently he amuses
    himself by moistening a strip with his forefinger and shaving it, as if he
    were vaguely curious to see if he is still a white man.</p>
  <p>The Hungerford coach ploughs past in a dense cloud of dust.</p>
  <p>The teams drag on again like a &ldquo;wounded snake that dies at sundown,&rdquo; if
    a wounded snake that dies at sundown could revive sufficiently next morning
    to drag on again until another sun goes down.</p>
  <p>Hopeless-looking swagmen are met with during the afternoon, and one carrier&mdash;he
    of the sanded leg&mdash;lends them tobacco; his mates contribute &ldquo;bits
    o&rsquo;&rdquo; tea, flour, and sugar.</p>
  <p>Sundown and the bullocks done up. The teamsters unyoke them and drive them
    on to the next water&mdash;five miles&mdash;having previously sent a mate
    to reconnoitre and see that boundary rider is not round, otherwise, to make
    terms with him, for it is a squatter&rsquo;s bore. They hurry the bullocks
    down to the water and back in the twilight, and then, under cover of darkness,
    turn them into a clearing in the scrub off the road, where a sign of grass
    might be seen&mdash;if you look close. But the &ldquo;bullockies&rdquo; are
    better off than the horse-teamsters, for bad chaff is sold by the pound and
    corn is worth its weight in gold.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mitchell and I turned off the track at the rabbit-proof fence and made for
    the tank in the mulga. We boiled the billy and had some salt mutton and damper.
    We were making back for Bourke, having failed to get a cut in any of the
    sheds on the Hungerford track. We sat under a clump of mulga saplings, with
    our backs to the trunks, and got out our pipes. Usually, when the flies were
    very bad on the track, we had to keep twigs or wild-turkey-tail feathers
    going in front of our faces the whole time to keep the mad flies out of our
    eyes; and, when we camped, one would keep the feather going while the other
    lit his pipe&mdash;then the smoke would keep them away. But the flies weren&rsquo;t
    so bad in a good shade or in the darkened hut. Mitchell&rsquo;s pipe would
    have smoked out Old Nick; it was an ancient string-bound meerschaum, and
    strong enough to kill a blackfellow. I had one smoke out of it, once when
    I felt bad in my inside and wanted to be sick, and the result was very satisfactory.</p>
  <p>Mitchell looked through his old pocket-book&mdash;more by force of habit
    than anything else&mdash;and turned up a circular from Tattersall&rsquo;s.
    And that reminded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do you know what I&rsquo;d do, Harry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I
    won Tattersall&rsquo;s big sweep, or was to come into fifty or a hundred
    thousand pounds, or, better still, a million?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing, I suppose,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;except to get away to Sydney
    or some cooler place than this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;d do,&rdquo; said Mitchell, talking
    round his pipe. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d build a Swagman&rsquo;s Rest right here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A Swagman&rsquo;s Rest?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes. Right here on this very God-forsaken spot. I&rsquo;d build a
    Swagman&rsquo;s Rest and call it the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel, or the Sundowners&rsquo; Arms,
    or the Half-way House to &mdash;&mdash;, or some such name that would take
    the bushmen&rsquo;s fancy. I&rsquo;d have it built on the best plans for
    coolness in a hot country; bricks, and plenty of wide verandas with brick
    floors, and balconies, and shingles, in the old Australian style. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    have a sheet of corrugated iron about the place. And I&rsquo;d have old-fashioned
    hinged sashes with small panes and vines round &rsquo;em; they look cooler
    and more homely and romantic than the glaring sort that shove up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d dig a tank or reservoir for surface water as big as
    a lake, and bore for artesian water&mdash;and get it, too, if I had to bore
    right through to England; and I&rsquo;d irrigate the ground and make it grow
    horse-feed and fruit, and vegetables too, if I had to cart manure from Bourke.
    And every teamster&rsquo;s bullock or horse, and every shearer&rsquo;s hack,
    could burst itself free, but I&rsquo;d make travelling stock pay&mdash;for
    it belongs to the squatters and capitalists. All carriers could camp for
    one night only. And I&rsquo;d&mdash;no, I wouldn&rsquo;t have any flowers;
    they might remind some heart-broken, new-chum black sheep of the house where
    he was born, and the mother whose heart he broke&mdash;and the father whose
    grey hairs he brought down in sorrow to the grave&mdash;and break him up
    altogether.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But what about the old-fashioned windows and the vines?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I forgot them. On second thought,
    I think I would have some flowers; and maybe a bit of ivy-green. The new
    chum might be trying to work out his own salvation, and the sight of the
    roses and ivy would show him that he hadn&rsquo;t struck such a God-forgotten
    country after all, and help strengthen the hope for something better that&rsquo;s
    in the heart of every vagabond till he dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Puff, puff, puff, slowly and reflectively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Until he dies,&rdquo; repeated Mitchell. &ldquo;And, maybe,&rdquo; he
    said, rousing himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a little room fixed up like
    a corner of a swell restaurant, with silver and napkins on the table, and
    I&rsquo;d fix up a waiter, so that when a broken-down University wreck came
    along he might feel, for an hour or so, something like the man he used to
    be. But I suppose,&rdquo; Mitchell reflected, &ldquo;he wouldn&rsquo;t feel
    completely his old self without a lady friend sitting opposite to him. I
    might fix up a black gin for him, but I suppose he&rsquo;d draw the colour
    line. But that&rsquo;s nonsense.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All teamsters and travellers could camp there for one night only.
    I&rsquo;d have shower-baths; but I wouldn&rsquo;t force any man to have a
    bath against his will. They could sit down to a table and have a feed off
    a table-cloth, and sleep in sheets, and feel like they did before their old
    mothers died, or before they ran away from home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who? The mothers?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, in some cases,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have
    a nice, cool little summer-house down near the artificial lake, out of earshot
    of the house, where the bullock-drivers could sit with their pipes after
    tea, and tell yarns, and talk in their own language. And I&rsquo;d have boats
    on the lake, too, in case an old Oxford or Cambridge man, or an old sailor
    came along&mdash;it might put years on to his life to have a pull at the
    oars. You remember that old sailor we saw in charge of the engine back there
    at the government tank? You saw how he had the engine?&mdash;clean and bright
    as a new pin&mdash;everything spick-and-span and shipshape, and his hut fixed
    up like a ship&rsquo;s cabin. I believe he thinks he&rsquo;s at sea half
    his time, and shoving her through it, instead of pumping muddy water out
    of a hole in the baking scrubs for starving stock. Or maybe he reckons he&rsquo;s
    keeping her afloat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have fish in this lake of yours?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;and any ratty old shepherd
    or sundowner, that&rsquo;s gone mad of heat and loneliness&mdash;like the
    old codger we met back yonder&mdash;he could sit by the lagoon in the cool
    of the evening and fish to his heart&rsquo;s content with a string and a
    bent pin, and dream he&rsquo;s playing truant from school and fishing in
    the brook near his native village in England about fifty years ago. It would
    seem more real than fishing in the dust as some mad old bushmen do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;d draw the line somewhere?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;not even at poets. I&rsquo;d try
    to cure them, too, with good wholesome food and plenty of physical exercise.
    The Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would be a refuge for men who&rsquo;d been jail-birds
    once as well as men who were gentlemen once, and for physical wrecks and
    ruined drunkards as well as healthy honest shearers. I&rsquo;d sit down and
    talk to the boozer or felon just as if I thought he was as good a man as
    me&mdash;and he might be, for that matter&mdash;God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The sick man would be kept till he recovered, or died; and the boozer,
    suffering from a recovery, I&rsquo;d keep him till he was on his legs again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d have to have a doctor,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that up all right.
    I wouldn&rsquo;t bother much about a respectable medical practitioner from
    the city. I&rsquo;d get a medical wreck who had a brilliant career before
    him once in England and got into disgrace, and cleared out to the colonies&mdash;a
    man who knows what the d.t.&rsquo;s is&mdash;a man who&rsquo;s been through
    it all and knows it all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d want a manager, or a clerk or secretary,&rdquo; I
    suggested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose I would,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no
    head for figures. I suppose I&rsquo;d have to advertise for him. If an applicant
    came with the highest testimonials of character, and especially if one was
    signed by a parson, I&rsquo;d tell him to call again next week; and if a
    young man could prove that he came of a good Christian family, and went to
    church regularly, and sang in the choir, and taught Sunday-school, I&rsquo;d
    tell him that he needn&rsquo;t come again, that the vacancy was filled, for
    I couldn&rsquo;t trust him. The man who&rsquo;s been extra religious and
    honest and hard-working in his young days is most likely to go wrong afterwards.
    I&rsquo;d sooner trust some poor old devil of a clerk who&rsquo;d got into
    the hands of a woman or racing men when he was young, and went wrong, and
    served his time for embezzlement; anyway, I&rsquo;d take him out and give
    him another chance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about woman&rsquo;s influence?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I suppose there&rsquo;d have to be a woman, if only to keep the
    doctor on the line. I&rsquo;d get a woman with a past, one that hadn&rsquo;t
    been any better than she should have been, they&rsquo;re generally the most
    kind-hearted in the end. Say an actress who&rsquo;d come down in the world,
    or an old opera-singer who&rsquo;d lost her voice but could still sing a
    little. A woman who knows what trouble is. And I&rsquo;d get a girl to keep
    her company, a sort of housemaid, with a couple of black gins or half-castes
    to help her. I&rsquo;d get hold of some poor girl who&rsquo;d been deceived
    and deserted: and a baby or two wouldn&rsquo;t be an objection&mdash;the
    kids would amuse the chaps and help humanize the place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what if the manageress fell in love with the doctor?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I couldn&rsquo;t provide against love,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I
    fell in love myself more than once&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t suppose I&rsquo;d
    have been any worse off if I&rsquo;d have stayed in love. Ah, well! But suppose
    she did fall in love with the doctor and marry him, or suppose she fell in
    love with him and didn&rsquo;t marry him, for that matter&mdash;and suppose
    the girl fell in love with the secretary? There wouldn&rsquo;t be any harm
    done; it would only make them more contented with the home and bind them
    to it. They&rsquo;d be a happy family, and the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel would
    be more cheerful and homelike than ever.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But supposing they all fell in love with each other and cleared out,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what they&rsquo;d have to clear out for,&rdquo; said
    Mitchell.  &ldquo;But suppose they did. There&rsquo;s more than one medical
    wreck in Australia, and more than one woman with a past, and more than one
    broken old clerk who went wrong and was found out, and who steadied down
    in jail, and there&rsquo;s more than one poor girl that&rsquo;s been deceived.
    I could easily replace &rsquo;em. And the Lost Souls&rsquo;  Hotel might
    be the means of patching up many wrecked lives in that way&mdash;giving people
    with pasts the chance of another future, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d have music and books and pictures?&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;But I wouldn&rsquo;t have any
    bitter or sex-problem books. They do no good. Problems have been the curse
    of the world ever since it started. I think one noble, kindly, cheerful character
    in a book does more good than all the clever villains or romantic adventurers
    ever invented. And I think a man ought to get rid of his maudlin sentiment
    in private, or when he&rsquo;s drunk. It&rsquo;s a pity that every writer
    couldn&rsquo;t put all his bitterness into one book and then burn it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No; I&rsquo;d have good cheerful books of the best and brightest
    sides of human nature&mdash;Charles Dickens, and Mark Twain, and Bret Harte,
    and those men. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian pictures&mdash;showing the
    brightest and best side of Australian life. And I&rsquo;d have all Australian
    songs. I wouldn&rsquo;t have &lsquo;Swannie Ribber,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Home,
    Sweet Home,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Annie Laurie,&rsquo; or any of those old songs
    sung at the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel&mdash;they&rsquo;re the cause of more
    heartbreaks and drink and suicide in the bush than anything else. And if
    a jackeroo got up to sing,  &lsquo;Just before the battle, mother,&rsquo; or, &lsquo;Mother
    bit me in me sleep,&rsquo; he&rsquo;d find it was just before the battle
    all right. He&rsquo;d have to go out and sleep in the scrub, where the mosquitoes
    and bulldog ants would bite him out of his sleep. I hate the man who&rsquo;s
    always whining about his mother through his nose, because, as a rule, he
    never cared a rap for his old mother, nor for anyone else, except his own
    paltry, selfish little self.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have intellectual and elevating conversation for those
    that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d take charge of that department?&rdquo; I inquired hurriedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; reflected Mitchell, &ldquo;I did have an idea of taking
    it on myself for a while anyway; but, come to think of it, the doctor or
    the woman with the past would have more experience; and I could look after
    that part of the business at a pinch. Of course you&rsquo;re not in a position
    to judge as to my ability in the intellectual line; you see, I&rsquo;ve had
    no one to practise on since I&rsquo;ve been with you. But no matter&mdash;&mdash; There&rsquo;d
    be intellectual conversation for the benefit of black-sheep new chums. And
    any broken-down actors that came along could get up a play if they liked&mdash;it
    would brighten up things and help elevate the bullock-drivers and sundowners.
    I&rsquo;d have a stage fixed up and a bit of scenery. I&rsquo;d do all I
    could to attract shearers to the place after shearing, and keep them from
    rushing to the next shanty with their cheques, or down to Sydney, to be cleaned
    out by barmaids.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;d have the hero squashed in the last act for a selfish
    sneak, and marry the girl to the villain&mdash;he&rsquo;d be more likely
    to make her happy in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And what about the farm?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;d
    get some expert from the agricultural college to manage that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get some poor drought-ruined
    selector and put him in charge of the vegetation. Only, the worst of it is.&rdquo; he
    reflected, &ldquo;if you take a selector who has bullocked all his life to
    raise crops on dusty, stony patches in the scrubs, and put him on land where
    there&rsquo;s plenty of water and manure, and where he&rsquo;s only got to
    throw the seed on the ground and then light his pipe and watch it grow, he&rsquo;s
    apt to get disheartened. But that&rsquo;s human nature.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, of course, I&rsquo;d have to have a &lsquo;character&rsquo; about
    the place&mdash;a sort of identity and joker to brighten up things. I wouldn&rsquo;t
    get a man who&rsquo;d been happy and comfortable all his life; I&rsquo;d
    get hold of some old codger whose wife had nagged him till she died, and
    who&rsquo;d been sold off many times, and run in for drowning his sorrows,
    and who started as an undertaker and failed at that, and finally got a job
    pottering round&mdash;gardener, or gatekeeper, or something&mdash;in a lunatic
    asylum. I&rsquo;d get him. He&rsquo;d most likely be a humorist and a philosopher,
    and he&rsquo;d help cheer up the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel. I reckon the lost
    souls would get very fond of him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And would you have drink at Lost Souls&rsquo;?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mitchell. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have the best beer and
    spirits and wine to be had. After tea I&rsquo;d let every man have just enough
    to make him feel comfortable and happy, and as good and clever, and innocent
    and honest as any other man, but no more. But if a poor devil came along
    in the horrors, with every inch of him jumping, and snakes, and green-eyed
    yahoos, and flaming-nosed bunyips chasing him, we&rsquo;d take him in and
    give him soothing draughts, and nurse him, and watch him, and clear him out
    with purgatives, and keep giving him nips of good whisky, and, above all,
    we&rsquo;d sympathize with him, and tell him that we were worse than he was
    many a time. We wouldn&rsquo;t tell him what a weak, selfish man he was,
    or harp on his ruined life. We&rsquo;d try to make him out a good deal better
    morally than he really was. It&rsquo;s remorse that hurries most men to hell&mdash;especially
    in the Bush. When a man firmly believes he is a hopeless case, then there&rsquo;s
    no hope for him: but let him have doubts and there&rsquo;s a chance. Make
    him believe that there are far worse cases than his. We wouldn&rsquo;t preach
    the sin of dissipation to him, no&mdash;but we&rsquo;d try to show him the&nbsp;<i>folly</i>&nbsp;of
    a wasted life. I ought to be able to preach that, God knows.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, above all, we&rsquo;d try to drive out of his head the cursed
    old popular idea that it&rsquo;s hard to reform&mdash;that a man&rsquo;s
    got to fight a hard battle with himself to get away from drink&mdash;pity
    drunkards can&rsquo;t believe how easy it is. And we&rsquo;d put it to him
    straight whether his few hours&rsquo; enjoyment were worth the days he had
    to suffer hell for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And, likely as not,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;when you&rsquo;d put him
    on his feet he&rsquo;d take the nearest track to the next shanty, and go
    on a howling spree, and come back to Lost Souls&rsquo; in a week, raving
    and worse than ever. What would you do then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d take him in again, and build him up some more; and a third
    or fourth time if necessary. I believe in going right on with a thing once
    I take it in hand. And if he didn&rsquo;t turn up after the last spree we&rsquo;d
    look for him up the scrub and bring him in and let him die on a bed, and
    make his death as comfortable as possible. I&rsquo;ve seen one man die on
    the ground, and found one dead in the bush. We&rsquo;d bury him under a gum
    and put &lsquo;Sacred to the Memory of a Man who Died. (Let him R.I.P.)&rsquo; over
    him. I&rsquo;d have a nice little graveyard, with gums for tombstones&mdash;and
    I&rsquo;d have some original epitaphs&mdash;I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And how much gratitude would you expect to get out of the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel?&rdquo; I
    asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; said Mitchell, promptly. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be
    a Gratitude Discovery Syndicate. People might say that the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel
    was a den for kidnapping women and girls to be used as decoys for the purpose
    of hocussing and robbing bushmen, and the law and retribution might come
    after me&mdash;but I&rsquo;d fight the thing out. Or they might want to make
    a K.C.M.G., or a god of me, and worship me before they hung me. I reckon
    a philanthropist or reformer is lucky if he escapes with a whole skin in
    the end, let alone his character&mdash;&mdash; But there!&mdash;&mdash; Talking
    of gratitude: it&rsquo;s the fear of ingratitude that keeps thousands from
    doing good. It&rsquo;s just as paltry and selfish and cowardly as any other
    fear that curses the world&mdash;it&rsquo;s rather more selfish than most
    fears, in fact&mdash;take the fear of being thought a coward, or being considered
    eccentric, or conceited, or affected, or too good, or too bad, for instance.
    The man that&rsquo;s always canting about the world&rsquo;s ingratitude has
    no gratitude owing to him as a rule&mdash;generally the reverse&mdash;he
    ought to be grateful to the world for being let live. He broods over the
    world&rsquo;s ingratitude until he gets to be a cynic. He sees the world
    like the outside of a window, as it were, with the blind drawn and the dead,
    cold moonlight shining on it, and he passes on with a sour face; whereas,
    if he took the trouble to step inside he&rsquo;d most likely find a room
    full of ruddy firelight, and sympathy and cheerfulness, and kindness, and
    love, and gratitude. Sometimes, when he&rsquo;s right down on his uppers,
    and forced to go amongst people and hustle for bread, he gets a lot of surprises
    at the amount of kindness he keeps running against in the world&mdash;and
    in places where he&rsquo;d never have expected to find it. But&mdash;ah,
    well! I&rsquo;m getting maudlin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve forgot all about the Lost Souls&rsquo; Hotel,&rdquo; I
    said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d fix that
    up all right. As soon as I&rsquo;d got things going smoothly under a man
    I could trust, I&rsquo;d tie up every penny I had for the benefit of the
    concern; get some &lsquo;white men&rsquo; for trustees, and take the track
    again. I&rsquo;m getting too old to stay long in one place&mdash;(I&rsquo;m
    a lost soul that always got along better in another place). I&rsquo;m so
    used to the track that if I was shut up in a house I&rsquo;d get walking
    up and down in my room of nights and disturb the folk; and, besides, I&rsquo;d
    feel lost and light-shouldered without the swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;d put all your money in the concern?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;except a pound or two to go on the track with&mdash;for,
    who knows, I might come along there, dusty and tired, and ragged and hard
    up and old, some day, and be very glad of a night&rsquo;s rest at the Lost
    Souls&rsquo; Hotel. But I wouldn&rsquo;t let on that I was old Mitchell,
    the millionaire, who founded Lost Souls&rsquo;. They might be too officious,
    and I hate fuss. . . . But it&rsquo;s time to take the track, Harry.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There came a cool breeze with sunset; we stood up stiffly, shouldered our
    swags and tucker-bags, and pushed on, for we had to make the next water before
    we camped. We were out of tobacco, so we borrowed some from one of the bullock-drivers.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBoozersHome"></a>The Boozers&rsquo; Home</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;dipsomaniac,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Mitchell, &ldquo;needs sympathy
    and commonsense treatment. (Sympathy&rsquo;s a grand and glorious thing,
    taking it all round and looking at it any way you will: a little of it makes
    a man think that the world&rsquo;s a good world after all, and there&rsquo;s
    room and hope for sinners, and that life&rsquo;s worth living; enough of
    it makes him sure of it: and an overdose of sympathy makes a man&nbsp;<i>feel</i>&nbsp;weak
    and ashamed of himself, and so moves him to stop whining&mdash;and wining&mdash;and
    buck up.)</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;m not taking the case of a workman who goes on the spree
    on pay night and sweats the drink out of himself at work next day, nor a
    slum-bred brute who guzzles for the love of it; but a man with brains, who
    drinks to drown his intellect or his memory. He&rsquo;s generally a man under
    it all, and a sensitive, generous, gentle man with finer feelings as often
    as not. The best and cleverest and whitest men in the world seem to take
    to drink mostly. It&rsquo;s an awful pity. Perhaps it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re
    straight and the world&rsquo;s crooked and they can see things too plain.
    And I suppose in the bush the loneliness and the thoughts of the girl-world
    they left behind help to sink  &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now a drunkard seldom reforms at home, because he&rsquo;s always
    surrounded by the signs of the ruin and misery he has brought on the home;
    and the sight and thought of it sets him off again before he&rsquo;s had
    time to recover from the last spree. Then, again, the noblest wife in the
    world mostly goes the wrong way to work with a drunken husband&mdash;nearly
    everything she does is calculated to irritate him. If, for instance, he brings
    a bottle home from the pub, it shows that he wants to stay at home and not
    go back to the pub any more; but the first thing the wife does is to get
    hold of the bottle and plant it, or smash it before his eyes, and that maddens
    him in the state he is in then.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No. A dipsomaniac needs to be taken away from home for a while. I
    knew a man that got so bad that the way he acted at home one night frightened
    him, and next morning he went into an inebriate home of his own accord&mdash;to
    a place where his friends had been trying to get him for a year past. For
    the first day or two he was nearly dead with remorse and shame&mdash;mostly
    shame; and he didn&rsquo;t know what they were going to do to him next&mdash;and
    he only wanted them to kill him quick and be done with it. He reckons he
    felt as bad as if he was in jail. But there were ten other patients there,
    and one or two were worse than he was, and that comforted him a lot. They
    compared notes and sympathized and helped each other. They discovered that
    all their wives were noble women. He struck one or two surprises too&mdash;one
    of the patients was a doctor who&rsquo;d attended him one time, and another
    was an old boss of his, and they got very chummy. And there was a man there
    who was standing for Parliament&mdash;he was supposed to be having a rest
    down the coast. . . . Yes, my old mate felt very bad for the first day or
    two; it was all Yes, Nurse, and Thank you, Nurse, and Yes, Doctor, and No,
    Doctor, and Thank you, Doctor. But, inside a week, he was calling the doctor &lsquo;Ol&rsquo; Pill-Box&rsquo; behind
    his back, and making love to one of the nurses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he said it was pitiful when women relatives came to visit patients
    the first morning. It shook the patients up a lot, but I reckon it did &rsquo;em
    good. There were well-bred old lady mothers in black, and hard-working, haggard
    wives and loving daughters&mdash;and the expressions of sympathy and faith
    and hope in those women&rsquo;s faces! My old mate said it was enough in
    itself to make a man swear off drink for ever. . . . Ah, God&mdash;what a
    world it is!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Reminds me how I once went with the wife of another old mate of mine
    to see him. He was in a lunatic asylum. It was about the worst hour I ever
    had in my life, and I&rsquo;ve had some bad ones. The way she tried to coax
    him back to his old self. She thought she could do it when all the doctors
    had failed. But I&rsquo;ll tell you about him some other time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The old mate said that the principal part of the treatment was supposed
    to be injection of bi-chloride of gold or something, and it was supposed
    to be a secret. It might have been water and sugar for all he knew, and he
    thought it was. You see, when patients got better they were allowed out,
    two by two, on their honour&mdash;one to watch the other&mdash;and it worked.
    But it was necessary to have an extra hold on them; so they were told that
    if they were a minute late for &lsquo;treatment,&rsquo; or missed one injection,
    all the good would be undone. This was dinged into their ears all the time.
    Same as many things are done in the Catholic religion&mdash;to hold the people.
    My old mate said that, as far as the medical treatment was concerned, he
    could do all that was necessary himself. But it was the sympathy that counted,
    especially the sympathy between the patients themselves. They always got
    hold of a new patient and talked to him and cheered him up; he nearly always
    came in thinking he was the most miserable wretch in this world.. And it
    comforts a man and strengthens him and makes him happier to meet another
    man who&rsquo;s worse off or sicker, or has been worse swindled than he has
    been. That&rsquo;s human nature. . . . And a man will take draughts from
    a nurse and eat for her when he wouldn&rsquo;t do it for his own wife&mdash;not
    even though she had been a trained nurse herself. And if a patient took a
    bad turn in the night at the Boozers&rsquo; Home and got up to hunt the snakes
    out of his room, he wouldn&rsquo;t be sworn at, or laughed at, or held down;
    no, they&rsquo;d help him shoo the snakes out and comfort him. My old mate
    said that, when he got better, one of the new patients reckoned that he licked
    St Pathrick at managing snakes. And when he came out he didn&rsquo;t feel
    a bit ashamed of his experience. The institution didn&rsquo;t profess to
    cure anyone of drink, only to mend up shattered nerves and build up wrecked
    constitutions; give them back some will-power if they weren&rsquo;t too far
    gone. And they set my old mate on his feet all right. When he went in his
    life seemed lost, he had the horror of being sober, he couldn&rsquo;t start
    the day without a drink or do any business without it. He couldn&rsquo;t
    live for more than two hours without a drink; but when he came out he didn&rsquo;t
    feel as if he wanted it. He reckoned that those six weeks in the institution
    were the happiest he&rsquo;d ever spent in his life, and he wished the time
    had been longer; he says he&rsquo;d never met with so much sympathy and genius,
    and humour and human nature under one roof before. And he said it was nice
    and novel to be looked after and watched and physicked and bossed by a pretty
    nurse in uniform&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t suppose he told his wife that. And
    when he came out he never took the trouble to hide the fact that he&rsquo;d
    been in. If any of his friends had a drunkard in the family, he&rsquo;d recommend
    the institution and do his best to get him into it. But when he came out
    he firmly believed that if he took one drink he&rsquo;d be a lost man. He
    made a mania of that. One curious effect was that, for some time after he
    left the institution, he&rsquo;d sometimes feel suddenly in high spirits&mdash;with
    nothing to account for it&mdash;something like he used to feel when he had
    half a dozen whiskies in him; then suddenly he&rsquo;d feel depressed and
    sort of hopeless&mdash;with nothing to account for that either&mdash;just
    as if he was suffering a recovery. But those moods never lasted long and
    he soon grew out of them altogether. He didn&rsquo;t flee temptation. He&rsquo;d
    knock round the pubs on Saturday nights with his old mates, but never drank
    anything but soft stuff&mdash;he was always careful to smell his glass for
    fear of an accident or trick. He drank gallons of ginger beer, milk-and-soda,
    and lemonade; and he got very fond of sweets, too&mdash;he&rsquo;d never
    liked them before. He said he enjoyed the novelty of the whole thing and
    his mates amused him at first; but he found he had to leave them early in
    the evening, and, after a while, he dropped them altogether. They seemed
    such fools when they were drunk (they&rsquo;d never seemed fools to him before).
    And, besides, as they got full, they&rsquo;d get suspicious of him, and then
    mad at him, because he couldn&rsquo;t see things as they could. That reminds
    me that it nearly breaks a man&rsquo;s heart when his old drinking chum turns
    teetotaller&mdash;it&rsquo;s worse than if he got married or died. When two
    mates meet and one is drunk and the other sober there is only one of two
    things for them to do if they want to hit it together&mdash;either the drunken
    mate must get sober or the sober mate drunk. And that reminds me: Take the
    case of two old mates who&rsquo;ve been together all their lives, say they
    always had their regular sprees together and went through the same stages
    of drunkenness together, and suffered their recoveries and sobered up together,
    and each could stand about the same quantity of drink and one never got drunker
    than the other. Each, when he&rsquo;s boozing, reckons his mate the cleverest
    man and the hardest case in the world&mdash;second to himself. But one day
    it happens, by a most extraordinary combination of circumstances, that Bill,
    being sober, meets Jim very drunk, and pretty soon Bill is the most disgusted
    man in this world. He never would have dreamed that his old mate could make
    such a fool and such a public spectacle of himself. And Bill&rsquo;s disgust
    intensifies all the time he is helping Jim home, and Jim arguing with him
    and wanting to fight him, and slobbering over him and wanting to love him
    by turns, until Bill swears he&rsquo;ll give Jim a hammering as soon as ever
    he&rsquo;s able to stand steady on his feet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose your old boozing mate&rsquo;s wife was very happy when
    he reformed,&rdquo; I said to Mitchell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, no,&rdquo; said Mitchell, rubbing his head rather ruefully. &ldquo;I
    suppose it was an exceptional case. But I knew her well, and the fact is
    that she got more discontented and thinner, and complained and nagged him
    worse than she&rsquo;d ever done in his drinking days. And she&rsquo;d never
    been afraid of him. Perhaps it was this way: She loved and married a careless,
    good-natured, drinking scamp, and when he reformed and became a careful,
    hard-working man, and an honest and respected fellow-townsman, she was disappointed
    in him. He wasn&rsquo;t the man that won her heart when she was a girl. Or
    maybe he was only company for her when he was half drunk. Or maybe lots of
    things. Perhaps he&rsquo;d killed the love in her before he reformed&mdash;and
    reformed too late. I wonder how a man feels when he finds out for the first
    time that his wife doesn&rsquo;t love him any longer? But my old mate wasn&rsquo;t
    the nature to find out that sort of thing. Ah, well! If a woman caused all
    our trouble, my God! women have suffered for it since&mdash;and they suffer
    like martyrs mostly and with the patience of working bullocks. Anyway it
    goes, if I&rsquo;m the last man in the world, and the last woman is the worst,
    and there&rsquo;s only room for one more in Heaven, I&rsquo;ll step down
    at once and take my chances in Blazes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSexProblemAgain"></a>The Sex Problem Again</b></h2>
  <p>It&nbsp;was Mitchell&rsquo;s habit to take an evening off now and then from
    yarning or reflecting, and proceed, in a most methodical manner, to wash
    his spare shirts and patch his pants. I was in the habit of contributing
    to some Sydney papers, and every man is an editor at heart, so, at other
    times, Mitchell would take another evening off, and root out my swag, and
    go through my papers in the same methodical manner, and make alterations
    and additions without comment or reference to me; and sometimes he&rsquo;d
    read a little thing of my own which didn&rsquo;t meet his views, and accidentally
    drop it into the fire; and at other times he&rsquo;d get hold of some rhyme
    or sketch that was troubling me, and wrap it up and give it to a passing
    mailman unbeknown to me. The unexpected appearance of such articles in the
    paper, as well as the effects of the involuntary collaboration in other pieces,
    gave me several big surprises.</p>
  <p>It was in camp on a fencing contract west of Bourke. We had a book which
    we&rsquo;d borrowed from a library at Bourke for a year or two&mdash;never
    mind the name of it&mdash;it was in ninety-one or ninety-two, and the sex
    problem was booming then.</p>
  <p>I had been surreptitiously tearing some carefully-written slips of manuscript&mdash;leaves
    taken from an old pocket-book&mdash;into small pieces; I dropped them, with
    apparent carelessness, into the fire and stood with my back to it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet five pounds,&rdquo; said Mitchell, suddenly, &ldquo;that
    you&rsquo;ve been trying your hand on a sex-problem story.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I shifted uneasily and brought my hands from behind me into my pockets. &ldquo;Well,
    to tell you the truth,&rdquo; I admitted, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; exclaimed Mitchell. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be put
    to the expense of sending you to Sydney for medical treatment yet. You&rsquo;ve
    been having too easy times lately, plenty of hard graft and no anxiety about
    tucker or the future. What are the symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, taking a hand out to scratch the back of my
    head, &ldquo;the plot looked all right&mdash;at first sight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So there&rsquo;s a plot, is there? Well, in the first place, a plot
    is a problem. Well, what&rsquo;s the plot? . . . Come on, you needn&rsquo;t
    be frightened to tell an old mate like me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;the yarn looked all right at first sight;
    that article of &lsquo;T&rsquo;s&rsquo; in the&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&nbsp;turned
    me off it; listen and see what you think of it: There was a young fellow,
    a bit of a genius &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just so, it&rsquo;s the geniuses that build the sex problems. It&rsquo;s
    an autobiography. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, he married a girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell (<i>sotto voce</i>): &ldquo;God help her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loved her, and she loved him: but after they&rsquo;d been married
    a while he found out that, although he understood her, she didn&rsquo;t and
    couldn&rsquo;t possibly ever understand him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; commented Mitchell, &ldquo;and if he hadn&rsquo;t caught
    the sex problem, nor been reading about it, he would never have found that
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It was a terrible disappointment,&rdquo; I continued&mdash;I had
    got into the habit of taking Mitchell&rsquo;s interruptions and comments
    as matters of course&mdash;&ldquo;He saw that his life would be a hell with
    her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t strike him that her life would be a hell with
    him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They had no thought in common.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;She was in her right mind then.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But he couldn&rsquo;t leave her because he loved her, and because
    he knew that she loved him and would break her heart if he left her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Must have been a pretty cocksure sort of a fellow,&rdquo; remarked
    Mitchell, &ldquo;but all geniuses are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he was with her he saw all her obstinacy, unreason, and selfishness;
    but when he was away he only saw her good points.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Pity such men don&rsquo;t stop away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought and thought, and brooded over it till his life was a hell&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mitchell: &ldquo;Jes-so: thanks to the problemaniacs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He thought of killing her and himself, and so taking her with him&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Mitchell. &ldquo;He must have loved her a lot.
    . . . Good Lord! That shows the awful effects of the sex problem on the mind
    of a healthy young man like you;&rdquo; and Mitchell stood up.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He lay awake by her side at nights thinking and fighting the thing
    out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve been lying awake, thinking, with me and &lsquo;the
    Oracle&rsquo; by your side. We&rsquo;ll have to plant the tommy-hawk, and
    watch you by turns at night till you get over this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One night he rested on his elbow, and watched her sleeping, and tried
    to reconstruct his ideal out of her, and, just when he was getting into a
    happier frame of mind, her mouth fell open, and she snored. . . . I didn&rsquo;t
    get any further than the snore,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, of course you didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Mitchell,  &ldquo;and
    none of the sex problemers ever will&mdash;unless they get as far as &lsquo;blanky.&rsquo;  You
    might have made the snore cure him; did it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, it was making things worse in my idea of the yarn. He fell back
    and lay staring at the ceiling in a hopeless kind of a way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then he was a fit case for the lunatic asylum. . . . Now, look here,
    Harry, you&rsquo;re a good-natured, soft old fool when you&rsquo;re in your
    right mind; just you go on being a good-natured, soft old fool, and don&rsquo;t
    try to make a problem out of yourself or anybody else, or you&rsquo;ll come
    to a bad end. A pocket-book&rsquo;s to keep your accounts in, not to take
    notes in (you take them in your head and use &rsquo;em in your arms), not
    to write sex-problem rot in&mdash;that&rsquo;s spoilt many a good pocket-book,
    and many a good man. You&rsquo;ve got a girl you&rsquo;re talking about going
    back to as soon as we&rsquo;ve finished this contract. Don&rsquo;t you make
    a problem of her; make a happy wife and mother of her. . . . I was very clever
    when I was young&rdquo;&mdash;and here Mitchell&rsquo;s voice took a tinge
    of bitterness, or sadness. &ldquo;I used to make problems out of things.
    . . . I ain&rsquo;t much to boast of now. . . . Seems to me that a good many
    men want to make angels of their wives without first taking trouble of making
    saints of themselves. We want to make women&rsquo;s ways our ways&mdash;it
    would be just as fair to make our ways theirs. Some men want to be considered
    gods in their own homes; you&rsquo;ll generally find that sort of men very
    small potatoes outside; if they weren&rsquo;t they wouldn&rsquo;t bother
    so much about being cocks on their own little dunghills. . . . And again,
    old mates seldom quarrel, because they understand each other&rsquo;s moods.
    Now, if you went brooding round for any length of time I&rsquo;d say to you. &lsquo;Now
    then, Harry, what have I been doing to you? Spit it out, old man.&rsquo; And
    you&rsquo;d do the same by me; but how many men would take even that much
    trouble with their wives?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A breeze stirred the mulga and brought the sound of a good voice singing
    in the surveyors&rsquo; camp</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never brought to min&rsquo;?<br>
    Should old acquaintance be forgot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the days of Auld Lang Syne?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&nbsp;damned old tune will upset the Oracle&nbsp;for the rest
    of the night,&rdquo; I said.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s the Oracle,&rdquo; said Mitchell.  &ldquo;He was
    wronged by a woman as few men are wronged; his life was ruined&mdash;but
    he isn&rsquo;t the man to take any stock in sex problems on account of her.
    He thinks he&rsquo;s great on problems, but he isn&rsquo;t. It all amounts
    to this&mdash;that he&rsquo;s sorry for most men and all women and tries
    to act up to it to the best of his ability; and if he ain&rsquo;t a Christian,
    God knows what is&mdash;I don&rsquo;t. No matter what a woman does to you,
    or what you think she does to you, there come times, sooner or later, when
    you feel sorry for her&mdash;deep down in your heart&mdash;that is if you&rsquo;re
    a man. And, no matter what action or course you might take against her, and
    no matter how right or justified you might seem in doing it, there comes
    a time when, deep down in your heart, you feel mean and doubtful about your
    own part. You can take that as a general thing as regards men against women,
    and man against man, I think. And I believe that deep-down feeling of being
    doubtful, or mean, or sorry, that comes afterwards, when you are cooler and
    know more about the world, is a right and natural thing, and we ought to
    act more in accordance with it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Came the refrain from the surveyors&rsquo; camp:</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;We twa hae run about the braes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; pu&rsquo;d the gowans fine;<br>
    But we&rsquo;ve wandered mony a weary foot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin&rsquo; Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We feel sorry for our quarrels with our worst enemy when we see him
    lying still and quiet&mdash;dead. Why can&rsquo;t we try and feel a bit sorry
    beforehand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;For
    Auld Lang Syne.<br>
    We twa ha&rsquo; padl&rsquo;t i&rsquo; the burn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fra mornin&rsquo; sun till dine;<br>
    But seas between us braid ha&rsquo; roar&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sin&rsquo; Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I used to feel blazing bitter against things one time but it never
    hurt anybody but myself in the end. I argued and quarrelled with a girl once&mdash;and
    made a problem of the thing and went away. She&rsquo;s married to a brute
    now, and I&rsquo;m what I am. I made a problem of a good home or the world
    once, and went against the last man in God&rsquo;s world that I should have
    gone against, and turned my back on his hand, and left him. His hand was
    very cold the next time I took it in mine. We don&rsquo;t want problems to
    make us more bitter against the world than we get sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p class="note">&lsquo;And here&rsquo;s a han&rsquo; my trusty frien&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; gie&rsquo;s a han&rsquo; o&rsquo; thine,<br>
    We&rsquo;ll tak&rsquo; a cup o&rsquo; kindness yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Auld Lang Syne.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And that song&rsquo;s the answer of all problems,&rdquo; said Mitchell.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * * * * </p>
  <p>But it was I who lay awake and thought that night.</p>
