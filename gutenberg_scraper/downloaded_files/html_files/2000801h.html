  <p><i>Once</i><i>&nbsp;more I write a line to you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While darker shadows fall;<br>
    Dear friends of mine who have been true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And steadfast through it all.<br>
    If I have written bitter rhymes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many lines that halt,<br>
    And if I have been false at times<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not all my fault.</i></p>
  <p><i>To Heaven&rsquo;s decree I would not bow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I sank very low&mdash;<br>
    The bitter things are written now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we must let them go.<br>
    But I feel softened as I write;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The better spirit springs,<br>
    And I am very sad to-night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of many things.</i></p>
  <p><i>The friendships that I have abused,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trust I did betray,<br>
    The talents that I have misused,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gifts I threw away.<br>
    The things that did me little good,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;well my cheeks might burn&mdash;<br>
    The kindly letters that I should<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have answered by return.</i></p>
  <p><i>But you might deem them answered now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And answered from my heart;<br>
    And injured friends will understand<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis I who feel the smart.<br>
    But I have done with barren strife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dark imaginings,<br>
    And in my future work and life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will seek the better things.</i> </p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WhenIwasKing"></a>When I was King</b></h2>
  <p>The second&nbsp;time I lived on earth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was several hundred years ago;<br>
    And&mdash;royal by my second birth&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know as much as most men know.<br>
    I was a king who held the reins<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As never modern monarch can;<br>
    I was a king, and I had brains,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what was more, I was a man!</p>
  <p>Called to the throne in stormy times,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things were at their very worst,<br>
    I had to fight&mdash;and not with rhymes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own self and my kindred first;<br>
    And after that my friends and foes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And great abuses born of greed;<br>
    And when I&rsquo;d fairly conquered those,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ruled the land a king indeed.</p>
  <p>I found a deal of rottenness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as in modern towns we find;<br>
    I camped my poor in palaces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tents upon the plain behind.<br>
    I marked the hovels, dens and drums<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that fair city by the sea.<br>
    And burnt the miles of wretched slums<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And built the homes as they should be.</p>
  <p>I stripped the baubles from the State,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And on the land I spent the spoil;<br>
    I hunted off the sullen great,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to the farmers gave the soil.<br>
    My people were their own police;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My courts were free to everyone.<br>
    My priests were to preach love and peace;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Judges to see justice done.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d studied men and studied kings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No crawling cant would I allow;<br>
    I hated mean and paltry things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I can hate them even now.<br>
    A land of men I meant to see,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A strong and clean and noble race&mdash;<br>
    No subject dared kneel down to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But looked his king straight in the face</p>
  <p>Had I not been a king in fact,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A king in council-hall and tent,<br>
    I might have let them crawl and act<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The courtier to their heart&rsquo;s content;<br>
    But when I called on other kings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saw men kneel, I felt inclined<br>
    To gently tip the abject things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kick them very hard behind.</p>
  <p>My subjects were not slaves, I guess,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But though the women in one thing&mdash;<br>
    A question &rsquo;twas of healthy dress&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would dare to argue with their king<br>
    (I had to give in there, I own,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though none denied that I was strong),<br>
    Yet they would hear my telephone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything went very wrong.</p>
  <p>I also had some poets bright&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their songs were grand, I will allow&mdash;<br>
    They were, if I remember right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About as bad as bards are now.<br>
    I had to give them best at last,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let them booze and let them sing;<br>
    As it is now, so in the past,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d small respect for gods or king.</p>
  <p>I loved to wander through the streets&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I carried neither sword nor dirk&mdash;<br>
    And watch the building of my fleets,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And watch my artisans at work.<br>
    At times I would take off my coat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And show them how to do a thing&mdash;<br>
    Till someone, clucking in his throat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would stare and gasp, &lsquo;It is the king!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And I would say, &lsquo;Shut up, you fools!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it for this my towns I burn?<br>
    You don&rsquo;t know how to handle tools,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by my faith you&rsquo;ll have to learn!&rsquo;<br>
    I was a king, but what of that?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A king may warble in the spring<br>
    And carry eggs home in his hat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that he&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;a king.</p>
  <p>I loved to stroll about the town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With chums at night, and talk of things,<br>
    And, though I chanced to wear the crown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends, by intellect, were kings.<br>
    When I was doubtful, then I might<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discuss a matter quietly,<br>
    But when I felt that I was right<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No power on earth could alter me!</p>
  <p>And now and then it was no sin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor folly to relax a bit&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;d take my friends into an inn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And call for wine and pay for it.<br>
    And then of many things we&rsquo;d clack<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With loosened tongues and visions clear&mdash;<br>
    I often heard behind my back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whispered &lsquo;Peace, the king is here!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The women harped about a queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew they longed to have a court<br>
    And flaunt their feathers on the scene,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But hitherto I&rsquo;d held the fort.<br>
    My subjects wanted me, no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give the throne a son and heir&mdash;<br>
    (There were some little kings about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was neither here nor there).</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d no occasion for a wife&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A queen as yet was not my plan;<br>
    I&rsquo;d seen a lot of married life&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My sire had been a married man.<br>
  &lsquo;A son and heir be hanged!&rsquo; I said&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;How dare you ask for such a thing,<br>
  &lsquo;You fight it out when I am dead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And let the best man be the king!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Your Majesty, we love you well!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A candid friend would say to me&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;But there be tales that people tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Unfitted to thy dignity&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;My dignity be damned!&rsquo; I&rsquo;d say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Bring me no women&rsquo;s chattering!<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be a man while yet I may&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;When trouble comes I&rsquo;ll be a king!</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d kept my kingdom clean and strong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While other kingdoms were like ours&mdash;<br>
    I had no need to brook a wrong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feared not all the rotten Powers<br>
    I did not eat my heart out then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor feebly fight in verse or prose<br>
    I&rsquo;d take five hundred thousand men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To argue matters with my foes!</p>
  <p>It thrilled me through, the mighty tramp<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of arm&euml;d men, the thundering cheer&mdash;<br>
    The pregnant whisper through the camp<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At dead of night: &lsquo;The King is here!&rsquo;<br>
    And though we paid for victory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On some fields that were hard to hold,<br>
    The faith my soldiers had in me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oft strengthened mine a hundredfold.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;d chat with soldiers by the fires<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On rocky heights and river banks,<br>
    I&rsquo;d seek the brains that war requires,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take my captains from the ranks.<br>
    And so, until the storm was by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And came the peace just war can bring,<br>
    I bore me so that men might cry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all their hearts, &lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo;</p>
  <p><i>When I was king the world was wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was strong and I was free.<br>
    I knew no hatred, knew no pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No envy and no treachery.<br>
    I feared no lies. I feared no truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor any storm that time might bring.<br>
    I had my love, I had my youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world was mine when I was king.</i> </p>
  <p>Peace came at last&mdash;and strange is Fate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women begged just once alone<br>
    To see me robed in royal state<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seated on my father&rsquo;s throne.<br>
    I thought, &lsquo;Shall I this boon deny?&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said&mdash;and &rsquo;twas a paltry thing:<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll show the fools just once that I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Can look, as well as be, a king.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>They dusted out the castle old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And from the closet and the chest<br>
    They dug the jewels set in gold&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crown and robes and all the rest.<br>
    They came with eyes like stars of night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With diamonds set in raven hair,<br>
    They came with arms and bosoms white&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, Oh my God! but one was fair!</p>
  <p>They dressed me as the kings had been,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ancient royal purple spread,<br>
    And one that was to be my queen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She placed the circlet on my head.<br>
    They pressed their hearts and bowed to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They knelt with arms uplifted all.<br>
    I felt the rush of vanity&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride that goes before the fall.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>And then the banquet and the wine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Satan&rsquo;s music and the glance<br>
    Of siren eyes. Those captains mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were reeling in the maddening dance:<br>
    A finger writing on the wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While girls sang as the angels sing&mdash;<br>
  <i>A drunken boaster in the hall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fool that used to be a king</i>.</p>
  <p>I rose again&mdash;no matter how&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman, and a deeper fall&mdash;<br>
    I move amongst my people now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most degraded of them all.<br>
    But, if in centuries to come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I live once more and claim my own,<br>
    I&rsquo;ll see my subjects blind and dumb<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before they set me on a throne.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheAuthorsFarewelltotheBushmen"></a>The Author&rsquo;s Farewell to the Bushmen</b></h2>
  <p>Some&nbsp;carry their swags in the Great North-West,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the bravest battle and die,<br>
    And a few have gone to their last long rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a few have said: Good-bye!<br>
    The coast grows dim, and it may be long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the Gums again I see;<br>
    So I put my soul in a farewell song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the chaps who barracked for me.</p>
  <p>Their days are hard at the best of times,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And their dreams are dreams of care&mdash;<br>
    God bless them all for their big soft hearts,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the brave, brave grins they wear!<br>
    God keep me straight as a man can go,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And true as a man may be!<br>
    For the sake of the hearts that were always so,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the men who had faith in me!</p>
  <p>And a ship-side word I would say, you chaps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the blood of the Don&rsquo;t-give-in!<br>
    The world will call it a boast, perhaps&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;ll win, if a man can win!<br>
    And not for gold nor the world&rsquo;s applause&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though ways to the end they be&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some who will not answer yet awhile,<br>
    Some whose bones rot in the mulga or lie bleaching on the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Died of thirst to win the land another mile.<br>
    Thrown from horses, ripped by cattle, lost on deserts; and the weak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mad through loneliness or drink (no matter which),<br>
    Drowned in floods or dead of fever by the sluggish slimy creek&mdash;<br>

    Riding night-watch round the cattle in the pelting, freezing rain,<br>

    Where they never take white women&mdash;there they live the living death<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a half-caste or a black-gin for a mate.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the stinging, blinding blight is in men&rsquo;s
  eyes&mdash;<br>
    On the wretched, burnt selections, on the big runs further out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the sand-storm rises lurid to the skies.<br>
    Not to profit when the grass is waving waist-high after rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mighty clip of wool comes rolling in&mdash;<br>
    For the Wool-King goes to Paris with his family again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the gold that souls are sacrificed to win.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are banquets in the latest London style,<br>
    While the men who made Australia live on damper, junk and tea&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the quiet voices whisper, &lsquo;Wait a while!&rsquo;<br>
    For the sons of all Australia, they were born to conquer fate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, where charity and friendship are sincere,<br>
    Where a sinner is a brother and a stranger is a mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the future of a nation&rsquo;s written clear.</p>
  <p>Aye, the cities claim the triumphs of a land they do not know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all empty is the day they celebrate!<br>
    For the men who made Australia federated long ago,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the men to rule Australia&mdash;they can wait.<br>
    Though the bed may be the rough bunk or the gum leaves or the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the roof for half the year may be the sky&mdash;<br>
    There are men amongst the Bushmen who were born to save the land!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&rsquo;ll take their places sternly by-and-by.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a whisper on the desert though the sunset breeze hath died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the scrubs, though not a breath to stir a bough,<br>
    There&rsquo;s a murmur, not of waters, down the Lachlan River side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the spirit of Australia waking now!<br>
    There&rsquo;s the weird hymn of the drought-night on the western water-shed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the beds of unlocked rivers crack and parch;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the dead that we have buried, and our great unburied dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who are calling now on living men to march!</p>
  <p>Round the camp fire of the fencers by the furthest panel west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the men&rsquo;s hut by the muddy billabong,<br>
    On the Great North-Western Stock-routes where the drovers never rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are sorting out the right things from the wrong.<br>
    In the shearers&rsquo; hut the slush lamp shows a haggard, stern-faced man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preaching war against the Wool-King to his mates;<br>
    And wherever go the billy, water-bag and frying-pan,<br>

  <p>Just a little six-room&rsquo;d shanty built of corrugated tin,<br>

  <p>But the swagman, on his uppers, pulls an undertaker&rsquo;s mug,<br>
    And he leans across the counter and he breathes in Charlie&rsquo;s lug&mdash;<br>
    Tale of thirst and of misfortune. Charlie knows it, and&mdash;ah, well!<br>
    But it&rsquo;s very bad for business at the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s a drink or two?&rsquo; says Charlie, &lsquo;and you
    can&rsquo;t refuse a feed;&rsquo;<br>
    But there&rsquo;s many a drink unpaid for, many sticks of &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; weed;<br>
    And the poor old spineless bummer and the broken-hearted swell<br>
    Know that they are sure of tucker at the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the liquor and the license and the &lsquo;carriage&rsquo; and
    the rent,<br>
    And the sea or grave &rsquo;twixt Charlie and the fivers he has lent;<br>
    And I&rsquo;m forced to think in sorrow, for I know the country well,<br>
    That the end will be the bailiff in the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>But he&rsquo;ll pack up in a hurry and he&rsquo;ll seek a cooler clime,<br>
    If I make a rise in England and I get out there in time.<br>
    For a mate o&rsquo; mine is Charlie and I stayed there for a spell,<br>
    And I owe more than a jingle to the Bulletin Hotel.</p>
  <p>But there&rsquo;s lots of graft between us, there are many miles of sea,<br>
    So, if you should drop on Charlie, just shake hands with him for me;<br>
    Say I think the Bush less lonely than the great town where I dwell,<br>

    (Their drought-dried graves are seldom green<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where even mates can find them).<br>
    They know too little of the world<br>

    Haggard old eyes that turn to the west&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Boys will be boys, and he&rsquo;s gone with the rest!&rsquo;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in trouble and maybe hard-up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe in want of a bite or a sup;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead of the fever, or lost in the drought,<br>

  <p>Wiry old man at the tail of the plough,<br>
  &lsquo;Heard of Jack lately? and where is he now?&rsquo;<br>
    Pauses a moment his forehead to wipe,<br>
    Drops the rope reins while he feels for his pipe,<br>
    Scratches his grey head in sorrow or doubt:<br>
  &lsquo;Somewheers or others he&rsquo;s knocking about.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knocking about on the runs of the West,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding his own with the worst and the best<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breaking in horses and risking his neck,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Droving or shearing and making a cheque;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight as a sapling&mdash;six-foot and sound,<br>

  <p>&lsquo;Oh, I dreamt I shore in a shearin&rsquo; shed, and it was a dream
    of joy,<br>
    For every one of the rouseabouts was a girl dressed up as a boy&mdash;<br>
    Dressed up like a page in a pantomime, and the prettiest ever seen&mdash;<br>
    They had flaxen hair, they had coal black hair&mdash;and every shade between.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;There was short,
    plump girls, there was tall, slim girls, and the handsomest ever seen&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They was four-foot-five, they
  was six-foot high, and every size between.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;The shed was cooled by electric fans that was over every shoot;<br>
    The pens was of polished ma-ho-gany, and ev&rsquo;rything else to suit;<br>
    The huts was fixed with spring-mattresses, and the tucker was simply grand,<br>
    And every night by the biller-bong we darnced to a German band.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Our pay was the wool on the jumbucks&rsquo; backs, so we shore till
    all was blue&mdash;<br>
    The sheep was washed afore they was shore (and the rams was scented too);<br>
    And we all of us cried when the shed cut out, in spite of the long, hot days,<br>
    For every hour them girls waltzed in with whisky and beer on tr-a-a-ays!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;There was three of them girls to every chap, and as jealous as they
    could be&mdash;<br>
    There was three of them girls to every chap, and six of &rsquo;em picked
    on me;<br>
    We was draftin&rsquo; &rsquo;em out for the homeward track and sharin&rsquo; &rsquo;em
    round like steam,<br>
    When I woke with my head in the blazin&rsquo; sun to find &rsquo;twas a shearer&rsquo;s
    dream.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They had kind grey
    eyes, they had coal-black eyes, and the grandest ever seen&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had plump pink hands,
  they had slim white hands, and every shape be-tw-e-e-n.&rsquo;</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WithDickens"></a>With Dickens</b></h2>
  <p>In&nbsp;Windsor Terrace, number four,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve taken my abode&mdash;<br>
    A little crescent from the street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bight from City Road;<br>
    And, hard up and in exile, I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To many fancies yield;<br>
    For it was here Micawber lived<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And David Copperfield.</p>
  <p>A bed, a table, and a chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bottle and a cup.<br>
    The landlord&rsquo;s waiting even now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For something to turn up.<br>
    The landlady is spiritless&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both seem tired of life;<br>
    They cannot fight the battle like<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Micawber and his wife.</p>
  <p>But in the little open space<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lies back from the street,<br>
    The same old ancient, shabby clerk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is sitting on a seat.<br>
    The same sad characters go by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ragged children play&mdash;<br>
    And things have very little changed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Dickens passed away.</p>
  <p>Some seek religion in their grief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some for friendship yearn;<br>
    Some fly to liquor for relief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I to Dickens turn.<br>
    I find him ever fresh and new,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His lesson ever plain;<br>
    And every line that Dickens wrote<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve read and read again.</p>
  <p>The tavern&rsquo;s just across the &lsquo;wye,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And frowsy women there<br>
    Are gossiping and drinking gin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And twisting up their hair.<br>
    And grubby girls go past at times,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And furtive gentry lurk&mdash;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t think anyone has died<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Dickens did his work.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s Jingle, Tigg, and Chevy Slyme,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Weevle&mdash;whom you will;<br>
    And hard-up virtue proudly slinks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the pawnshop still.<br>
    Go east a bit from City Road,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the rest are there&mdash;<br>
    A friendly whistle might produce<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Chicken anywhere.</p>
  <p>My favourite author&rsquo;s heroes I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should love, but somehow can&rsquo;t.<br>
    I don&rsquo;t like David Copperfield<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As much as David&rsquo;s Aunt,<br>
    And it may be because my mind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been in many fogs&mdash;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t like Nicholas Nickleby<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So well as Newman Noggs.</p>
  <p>I don&rsquo;t like Richard Carstone, Pip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Martin Chuzzlewit,<br>
    And for the rich and fatherly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scarcely care a bit.<br>
    The honest, sober clods are bores<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cannot suffer much,<br>
    And with the Esther Summersons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never was in touch.</p>
  <p>The &lsquo;Charleys&rsquo; and the haggard wives,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind hearts in poverty&mdash;<br>
    And yes! the Lizzie Hexams, too&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are very near to me;<br>
    But men like Brothers Cheeryble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Madeline Bray divine,<br>
    And Nell, and Little Dorrit live<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a better world than mine.</p>
  <p>The Nicklebys and Copperfields,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do not stand the test;<br>
    And in my heart I don&rsquo;t believe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dickens loved them best.<br>
    I can&rsquo;t admire their ways and talk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not like their looks&mdash;<br>
    Those selfish, injured sticks that stalk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the Master&rsquo;s books.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;re mostly selfish in their love,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And selfish in their hate,<br>
    They marry Dora Spenlows, too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Agnes Wickfields wait;<br>
    And back they come to poor Tom Pinch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When hard-up for a friend;<br>
    They come to wrecks like Newman Nogga<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help them in the end.</p>
  <p>And&mdash;well, maybe I am unjust,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And maybe I forget;<br>
  <i>Some</i>&nbsp;of us marry dolls and jilt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Agnes Wickfields yet.<br>
    We seek our friends when fortune frowns&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been ever thus&mdash;<br>
    And we neglect Joe Gargery<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When fortune smiles on us.</p>
  <p>They get some rich old grandfather<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or aunt to see them through,<br>
    And you can trace self-interest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In nearly all they do.<br>
    And scoundrels like Ralph Nickleby,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of all their crimes,<br>
    And crawlers like Uriah Heep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Told bitter truths at times.</p>
  <p>But&mdash;yes, I love the vagabonds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And failures from the ranks,<br>
    And hard old files with hidden hearts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Wemmick and like Pancks.<br>
    And Jaggers had his &lsquo;poor dreams, too,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fond hopes like the rest&mdash;<br>
    But, somehow, somehow, all my life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve loved Dick Swiveller best!</p>
  <p>But, let us peep at Snagsby first<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As softly he lays down<br>
    Beside the bed of dying Joe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another half-a-crown.<br>
    And Nemo&rsquo;s wretched pauper grave&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we can let them be,<br>
    For Joe has said to Heaven: &lsquo;They<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wos werry good to me.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Wemmick with his aged P&mdash;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No doubt has his reward;<br>
    And Jaggers, hardest nut of all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will be judged by the Lord.<br>
    And Pancks, the rent-collecting screw,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With laurels on his brow,<br>
    Is loved by all the bleeding hearts<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Bleeding Heart Yard now.</p>
  <p>Tom Pinch is very happy now,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Magwitch is at rest,<br>
    And Newman Noggs again might hold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His head up with the best;<br>
    Micawber, too, when all is said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drank bravely Sorrow&rsquo;s cup&mdash;<br>
    Micawber worked to right them all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And something&nbsp;<i>did</i>&nbsp;turn up.</p>
  <p>How do &lsquo;John Edward Nandy, Sir!&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Plornish get along?<br>
    Why! if the old man is in voice<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Italian tongue.</p>
  <p>Before we go we&rsquo;ll ask about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor young John Chivery:<br>
  &lsquo;There never was a gentleman<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all his family.&rsquo;<br>
    His hopeless love, his broken heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to his rival true;<br>
    He came of Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But young John never knew.</p>

    Jack Bunsby stands by what he says<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Which isn&rsquo;t very clear),<br>
    And Toots with his own hopeless love&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As true as any here.</p>
  <p>And who that read has never felt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sorrow that it cost<br>
    When Captain Cuttle read the news<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &lsquo;Son and Heir&rsquo; was lost?<br>
    And who that read has not rejoiced<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With him and &lsquo;Heart&rsquo;s Delight,&rsquo;<br>
    And felt as Captain Cuttle felt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Wal&rsquo;r came that night?</p>
  <p>And yonder, with a broken heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That people thought was stone,<br>
    Deserted in his ruined home,<br>

  <p>The hints of the river below; and, away on the azure and green,<br>
    The old goldfield of Specimen Flat, and the township&mdash;a blotch on the
    scene;<br>
    The store, the hotels, and the bank&mdash;and the gaol and the people who
    come<br>
    With the weatherboard box and the tank&mdash;the Australian idea of home:</p>
  <p>The scribe&mdash;spirit-broken; the &lsquo;wreck,&rsquo; in his might-have-been
    or shame;<br>
    The townsman &lsquo;respected&rsquo; or worthy; the workman respectful and
    tame;<br>
    The boss of the pub with his fine sense of honour, grown moral and stout,<br>
    Like the spielers who came with the &lsquo;line,&rsquo; on the cheques that
    were made farther out.</p>
  <p>The clever young churchman, despised by the swaggering, popular man;<br>
    The doctor with hands clasped behind, and bowed head, as if under a ban;<br>
    The one man with the brains&mdash;with the power to lead, unsuspected and
    dumb,<br>
    Whom Fate sets apart for the Hour&mdash;the man for the hour that might come.</p>
  <p>The old local liar whose story was ancient when Egypt was young,<br>
    And the gossip who hangs on the fence and poisons God&rsquo;s world with
    her tongue;<br>
    The haggard bush mother who&rsquo;d nag, though a husband or child be divine,<br>
    And who takes a fierce joy in a rag of the clothes on the newcomer&rsquo;s
    line.</p>
  <p>And a lad with a cloud on his heart who was lost in a world vague and dim&mdash;<br>
    No one dreamed as he drifted apart that &rsquo;twas genius the matter with
    him;<br>
    Who was doomed, in that ignorant hole, to its spiritless level to sink,<br>
    Till the iron had entered his soul, and his brain found a refuge in drink.</p>

  <p>Perhaps I was bitter because of the tongues of disgrace in the town&mdash;<br>
    Of a boy-nature misunderstood and its nobler ambitions sneered<br>
    Of the sense of injustice that stings till it ends in the creed of the push&mdash;<br>
    I was born in that shadow that clings to the old gully homes in the bush.</p>
  <p>And I was ambitious. Perhaps as a boy I could see things too plain&mdash;<br>
    How I wished I could write of the truths&mdash;of the visions&mdash;that
    haunted my brain!<br>
    Of the bush-buried toiler denied e&rsquo;en the last loving comforts of all&mdash;<br>
    Of my father who slaved till he died in the scrub by his wedges and maul.</p>
  <p>Twenty years, and from daylight till dark&mdash;twenty years it was split,
    fence, and grub,<br>
    And the end was a tumble-down hut and a bare, dusty patch in the scrub.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the first time he&rsquo;d rested, they said, but the knit in his
  forehead was deep,<br>
    And to me the scarred hands of the dead seemed to&nbsp;<i>work</i>&nbsp;as
    I&rsquo;d seen them in sleep.</p>
  <p>And the mother who toiled by his side, through hardship and trouble and
    drought,<br>
    And who fought for the home when he died till her heart&mdash;not her spirit&mdash;wore
    out:<br>
    I am shamed for Australia and haunted by the face of the haggard bush wife&mdash;<br>
    She who fights her grim battle undaunted because she knows nothing of life.</p>
  <p>By the barren track travelled by few men&mdash;poor victims of commerce,
    unknown&mdash;<br>
    E&rsquo;en the troubles that woman tells woman she suffers, unpitied, alone;<br>
    Heart-dumbed and mind-dulled and benighted, Eve&rsquo;s beauty in girlhood
    destroyed!<br>
    Till the wrongs never felt shall be righted&mdash;and the peace never missed
    be enjoyed.</p>
  <p>There was no one to understand me. I was lonely and shy as a lad,<br>
    Or I lived in a world that was wider than ours; so of course I was &lsquo;mad.&rsquo;<br>
    Who is not understood is a &lsquo;crank&rsquo;&mdash;so I suffered the tortures
    of men<br>
    Doomed to think in the bush, till I drank and went wrong&mdash;I grew popular&nbsp;<i>then</i>.</p>
  <p>There was Doctor Lebenski, my friend&mdash;and the friend, too, of all who
    were down&mdash;<br>
    Clever, gloomy, and generous drunkard&mdash;the pride and disgrace of the
    town.<br>
    He had been through the glory and shame of a wild life by city and sea,<br>
    And the tales of the land whence he came had a strong fascination for me.</p>
  <p>And often in yarning or fancy, when she-oaks grew misty and dim,<br>
    From the forest and straight for the camp of the Cossack I&rsquo;ve ridden
    with him:<br>
    Ridden out in the dusk with a score, ridden back ere the dawning with ten&mdash;<br>
    Have struck at three kingdoms and Fate for the fair land of Poland again!</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;d a sorrow that drink couldn&rsquo;t drown&mdash;that his great
    heart was powerless to fight&mdash;<br>
    And I gathered the threads &rsquo;twixt the long, pregnant puffs of his last
    pipe at night;<br>
    For he&rsquo;d say to me, sadly: &lsquo;Jack Drew&rsquo;&mdash;then he&rsquo;d
    pause, as to watch the smoke curl&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;If a good girl should love you, be true&mdash;though you die for it&mdash;true
  to the girl!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;A man may be false to his country&mdash;a man may be false to his
    friend:<br>
  &lsquo;Be a vagabond, drunkard, a spieler&mdash;yet his soul may come right
  in the end;<br>
  &lsquo;But there is no prayer, no atonement, no drink that can banish the shade<br>
  &lsquo;From your side, if you&rsquo;ve one spark of manhood, of a dead girl
  that you have betrayed.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>&lsquo;One chance for a fortune,&rsquo; we&rsquo;re told, in the lives of
    the poorest of men&mdash;<br>
    There&rsquo;s a chance for a heaven on earth that comes over and over again!<br>
  &rsquo;Twas for Ruth, the bank manager&rsquo;s niece, that the wretched old
  goldfield grew fair,<br>
    And she came like an angel of peace in an hour of revengeful despair.</p>
  <p>A girl as God made her, and wise in a faith that was never estranged&mdash;<br>
    From childhood neglected and wronged, she had grown with her nature unchanged;<br>
    And she came as an angel of Hope as I crouched on Eternity&rsquo;s brink,<br>
    And the loaded revolver and rope were parts of the horrors of drink.</p>
  <p>I was not to be trusted, they said, within sight of a cheque or a horse,<br>
    And the worst that was said of my name all the gossips were glad to endorse.<br>
    But she loved me&mdash;she loved me! And why? Ask the she-oaks that sighed
    in the bends&mdash;<br>
    We had suffered alike, she and I, from the blindness of kinsfolk and friends.</p>
  <p>A girlhood of hardship and care, for she gave the great heart of a child<br>
    To a brother whose idol was Self, and a brother good-natured but &lsquo;wild;&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    And a father who left her behind when he&rsquo;d suffered too much from the
    moan<br>
    Of a mother grown selfish and blind in her trouble&mdash;&rsquo;twas always
    her own.</p>
  <p>She was brave, and she never complained, for the hardships of youth that
    had driven<br>
    My soul to the brink of perdition, but strengthened the girl&rsquo;s faith
    in Heaven.<br>
    In the home that her relatives gave she was tortured each hour of her life.<br>
    By her cruel dependence&mdash;the slave of her aunt, the bank-manager&rsquo;s
    wife.</p>
  <p>Does the world know how easy to lead and how hard to be driven are men?<br>
    She was leading me back with her love, to the faith of my childhood again!<br>
    To my boyhood&rsquo;s neglected ideal&mdash;to the hopes that were strangled
    at birth,<br>
    To the good and the truth of the real&mdash;to the good that was left on
    the earth.</p>
  <p>And the sigh of the oaks seemed a hymn, and the waters had music for me<br>
    As I sat on the grass at her feet, and rested my head on her knee;<br>
    And we seemed in a dreamland apart from the world&rsquo;s discontent and
    despair,<br>
    For the cynic went out of my heart at the touch of her hand on my hair.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>She would talk like a matron at times, and she prattled at times like a
    child:<br>
  &lsquo;I will trust you&mdash;I know you are good&mdash;you have only been
  careless and wild&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;You are clever&mdash;you&rsquo;ll rise in the world&mdash;you must think
  of your future and me&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;You will give up the drink for my sake, and you don&rsquo;t know how
  happy we&rsquo;ll be!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I can work, I will help you,&rsquo; she said, and she&rsquo;d plan
    out our future and home,<br>
    But I found no response in my heart save the hungry old craving to roam.<br>
    Would I follow the paths of the dead? I was young yet. Would I settle down<br>
    To the life that our parents had led by the dull, paltry-spirited town?</p>
  <p>For the ghost of the cynic was there, and he waited and triumphed at last&mdash;<br>
    One night&mdash;I&rsquo;d been drinking, because of a spectre that rose from
    the past&mdash;<br>
    My trust had so oft been betrayed: that at last I had turned to distrust&mdash;<br>
    My sense of injustice so keen that my anger was always unjust.</p>
  <p>Would I sacrifice all for a wife, who was free now to put on my hat<br>
    And to go far away from the life&mdash;from the home life of Specimen Flat?<br>
    Would I live as our fathers had lived to the finish? And what was it worth?<br>
    A woman&rsquo;s reproach in the end&mdash;of all things most unjust on the
    earth.</p>
  <p>The old rebel stirred in my blood, and he whispered, &lsquo;What matter?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why
    not?&rsquo;<br>
    And she trembled and paled, for the kiss that I gave her was reckless and
    hot.<br>
    And the angel that watched o&rsquo;er her slept, and the oaks sighed aloud
    in the creek<br>
    As we sat in a shadow that crept from a storm-cloud that rose on the Peak.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a voice warns the purest and best of their danger in love
    or in strife,<br>
    But that voice is a knell to her honour who loves with the love of her life!<br>
    And &lsquo;Ruth&mdash;Ruth!&rsquo; I whispered at last in a voice that was
    not like my own&mdash;<br>
    She trembled and clung to me fast with a sigh that was almost a moan.</p>
  <p>While you listen and doubt, and incline to the devil that plucks at your
    sleeve&mdash;<br>
    When the whispers of angels have failed&mdash;then Heaven speaks once I believe.<br>
    The lightning leapt out&mdash;in a flash only seen by those ridges and creeks,<br>
    And the darkness shut down with a crash that I thought would have riven the
    peaks.</p>
  <p>By the path through the saplings we ran, as the great drops came pattering
    down,<br>
    To the first of the low-lying ridges that lay between us and the town;<br>
    Where she suddenly drew me aside with that beautiful instinct of love<br>
    As the clatter of hoofs reached our ears&mdash;and a horseman loomed darkly
    above.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas the Doctor: he reined up and sat for the first moment pallid
    and mute,<br>
    Then he lifted his hand to his hat with his old-fashioned martial salute,<br>
    And he said with a glance at the ridge, looming black with its pine-tops
    awhirl,<br>
  &lsquo;Take my coat, you are caught in the storm!&rsquo; and he whispered, &lsquo;Be
  true to the girl!&rsquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>He rode on&mdash;to a sick bed, maybe some twenty miles back in the bush,<br>
    And we hurried on through the gloom, and I still seemed to hear in the &lsquo;woosh&rsquo;<br>
    Of the wind in the saplings and oaks, in the gums with their top boughs awhirl&mdash;<br>
    In the voice of the gathering tempest&mdash;the warning, &lsquo;Be true to
    the girl!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And I wrapped the coat round her, and held her so close that I felt her
    heart thump<br>
    When the lightning leapt out, as we crouched in the lee of the shell of a
    stump&mdash;<br>
    And there seemed a strange fear in her eyes and the colour had gone from
    her cheek&mdash;<br>
    And she scarcely had uttered a word since the hot brutal kiss by the creek.</p>
  <p>The storm rushed away to the west&mdash;to the ridges drought-stricken and
    dry&mdash;<br>
    To the eastward loomed far-away peaks &rsquo;neath the still starry arch
    of the sky;<br>
    By the light of the full moon that swung from a curtain of cloud like a lamp,<br>
    I saw that my tent had gone down in the storm, as we passed by the camp.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis a small thing, or chance, such as this, that decides between
    hero and cur<br>
    In one&rsquo;s heart. I was wet to the skin, and my comfort was precious
    to her.<br>
    And her aunt was away in the city&mdash;the dining-room fire was alight,<br>
    And the uncle was absent&mdash;he drank with some friends at the Royal that
    night.</p>
  <p>He came late, and passed to his room without glancing at her or at me&mdash;<br>
    Too straight and precise, be it said, for a man who was sober to be.<br>
    Then the drop of one boot on the floor (there was no wife to witness his
    guilt),<br>
    And a moment thereafter a snore that proclaimed that he slept on the quilt.</p>
  <p>Was it vanity, love, or revolt? Was it joy that came into my life?<br>
    As I sat there with her in my arms, and caressed her and called her &lsquo;My
    wife!&rsquo;<br>
    Ah, the coward! But my heart shall bleed, though I live on for fifty long
    years,<br>
    For she could not cry out, only plead with eyes that were brimming with tears.</p>
  <p>Not the passion so much brings remorse, but the thought of the treacherous
    part<br>
    I&rsquo;d have played in a future already planned out&mdash;ay! endorsed
    in my heart!<br>
    When a good woman falls for the sake of a love that has blinded her eyes,<br>
    There is pardon, perhaps, for his lust; but what heaven could pardon the
    lies?</p>
  <p>And &lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;You are mine, I am
    yours&mdash;and for life.<br>
  &lsquo;He is drunk and asleep&mdash;he won&rsquo;t hear, and to morrow you
  shall be my wife!&rsquo;<br>
    There&rsquo;s an hour in the memory of most that we hate ever after and loathe&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the daylight that came like a ghost to her window that startled
  us both.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>Twixt the door of her room and the door of the office I stood for a space,<br>
    When a treacherous board in the floor sent a crack like a shot through the
      place!&mdash;<br>
    Then the creak of a step and the click of a lock in the manager&rsquo;s room&mdash;<br>
    I grew cold to the stomach and sick, as I trembled and shrank in the gloom.</p>
  <p>He faced me, revolver in hand&mdash;&lsquo;Now I know you, you treacherous
    whelp!<br>
  &lsquo;Stand still, where you are, or I&rsquo;ll fire!&rsquo; and he suddenly
  shouted for help.<br>
  &lsquo;Help! Burglary!&rsquo; Yell after yell&mdash;such a voice would have
  wakened the tomb;<br>
    And I heard her scream once, and she fell like a log on the floor of her
    room!</p>
  <p>And I thought of her then like a flash&mdash;of the foul fiend of gossip
    that drags<br>
    A soul to perdition&mdash;I thought of the treacherous tongues of the hags;<br>
    She would sacrifice all for my sake&mdash;she would tell the whole township
    the truth.<br>
    I&rsquo;d escape, send the Doctor a message and die&mdash;ere they took me&mdash;for
    Ruth!</p>
  <p>Then I rushed him&mdash;a struggle&mdash;a flash&mdash;I was down with a
    shot in my arm&mdash;<br>
    Up again, and a desperate fight&mdash;hurried footsteps and cries of alarm!<br>
    A mad struggle, a blow on the head&mdash;and the gossips will fill in the
    blank<br>
    With the tale of the capture of Drew on the night he broke into the bank.</p>
  <p>In the cell at the lock-up all day and all night, without pause through
    my brain<br>
    Whirled the scenes of my life to the last one&mdash;and over and over again<br>
    I paced the small cell, till exhaustion brought sleep&mdash;and I woke to
    the past<br>
    Like a man metamorphosed&mdash;clear-headed, and strong in a purpose at last.</p>
  <p>She would sacrifice all for my sake&mdash;she would tell the whole township
    the truth&mdash;<br>
    In the mood I was in I&rsquo;d have given my life for a moment with Ruth;<br>
    But still, as I thought, from without came the voice of the constable&rsquo;s
    wife;<br>
  &lsquo;They say it&rsquo;s brain fever, poor girl, and the doctor despairs
  of her life.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;He has frightened the poor girl to death&mdash;such a pity&mdash;so
    pretty and young,&rsquo;<br>
    So the voice of a gossip chimed in: &lsquo;And the wretch! he deserves to
    be hung.<br>
  &lsquo;They were always a bad lot, the Drews, and I knowed he was more rogue
  than crank,<br>
  &lsquo;And he only pretended to court her so&rsquo;s to know his way into the
  bank!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Came the doctor at last with his voice hard and cold and a face like a stone&mdash;<br>
    Hands behind, but it mattered not then&mdash;&rsquo;twas a fight I must fight
    out alone:<br>
  &lsquo;You have cause to be thankful,&rsquo; he said, as though speaking a
  line from the past&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;She was conscious an hour; she is dead, and she called for you, Drew,
  till the last!</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Ay! And I knew the truth, but I lied. She fought for the truth, but
    I lied;<br>
  &lsquo;And I said you were well and were coming, and, listening and waiting,
  she died.<br>
  &lsquo;God forgive you! I warned you in time. You will suffer while reason
  endures:<br>
  &lsquo;For the rest, you will know only I have the key of her story&mdash;and
  yours.&rsquo;</p>

  <p>The curious crowd in the court seemed to me but as ghosts from the past,<br>
    As the words of the charge were read out, like a hymn from the first to the
      last;<br>
    I repeated the words I&rsquo;d rehearsed&mdash;in a voice that seemed strangely
    away&mdash;<br>
    In their place, &lsquo;I am guilty,&rsquo; I said; and again, &lsquo;I have
    nothing to say.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I realised then, and stood straight&mdash;would I shrink from the eyes of
    the clown&mdash;<br>
    From the eyes of the sawney who&rsquo;d boast of success with a girl of the
    town?<br>
    But there is human feeling in men which is easy, or hard, to define:<br>
    Every eye, as I glanced round the court, was cast down, or averted from mine.</p>
  <p>Save the doctor&rsquo;s&mdash;it seemed to me then as if he and I stood
    there alone&mdash;<br>
    For a moment he looked in my eyes with a wonderful smile in his own,<br>
    Slowly lifted his hand in salute, turned and walked from the court-room,
    and then<br>
    From the rear of the crowd came the whisper: &lsquo;The Doctor&rsquo;s been
    boozing again!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I could laugh at it then from the depth of the bitterness still in my heart,<br>
    At the ignorant stare of surprise, at the constables&rsquo; &lsquo;Arder
    in Car-rt!&rsquo;<br>
    But I know. Oh, I understand now how the poor tortured heart cries aloud<br>
    For a flame from High Heaven to wither the grin on the face of a crowd.</p>
  <p>Then the Judge spoke harshly; I stood with my fluttering senses awhirl:<br>
    My crime, he said sternly, had cost the young life of an innocent girl;<br>
    I&rsquo;d brought sorrow and death to a home, I was worse than a murderer
    now;<br>
    And the sentence he passed on me there was the worst that the law would allow.</p>

    Ah! the pain in my heart&mdash;as of old; and I know what it is&mdash;it
    is death.<br>
    It is death&mdash;it is rest&mdash;it is sleep. &rsquo;Tis the world and
    I drifting apart.<br>
    I have been through a sorrow too deep to have passed without breaking my
    heart.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a breeze! And a light without bars! Let me drink the free
    air till I drown.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the she-oaks&mdash;the Peak&mdash;and the stars. Lo, a dead angel&rsquo;s
  spirit floats down!<br>
    This will pass&mdash;aye, and all things will pass. Oh, my love, have you
    come back to me?<br>
    I am tired&mdash;let me lie on the grass at your feet, with my head on your
    knee.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I was wrong&rsquo;&mdash;the words lull me to sleep, like the words
    of a lullaby song&mdash;<br>
    I was wrong&mdash;but the iron went deep in my heart ere I knew I was wrong.<br>
    I rebelled, but I suffered in youth, and I suffer too deeply to live:<br>
    You&rsquo;ll forgive me, and pray for me, Ruth&mdash;for you loved me&mdash;and
    God will forgive.</p>

    The hottest drought that ever blazed could never parch the hearts of men;<br>
    And they were men in spite of all, and they were straight, and they were
    true,<br>
    The hat went round at trouble&rsquo;s call, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>They drank, when all is said and done, they gambled, and their speech was
    rough&mdash;<br>
    You&rsquo;d only need to say of one&mdash;&lsquo;He was my mate!&rsquo; that
    was enough.<br>
    To hint a bushman was not white, nor to his Union straight and true,<br>
    Would mean a long and bloody fight in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>The yard behind the Shearers&rsquo; Arms was reckoned best of battle grounds,<br>
    And there in peace and quietness they fought their ten or fifteen rounds;<br>
    And then they washed the blood away, and then shook hands, as strong men
    do&mdash;<br>
    And washed away the bitterness&mdash;in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>The Army on the grand old creek was mighty in those days gone by,<br>
    For they had sisters who could shriek, and brothers who could testify;<br>
    And by the muddy waterholes, they tackled sin till all was blue&mdash;<br>
    They took our bobs and damned our souls in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>By shanty bars and shearing sheds, they took their toll and did their work&mdash;<br>
    But now and then they lost their heads, and raved of hotter hells than Bourke:<br>
    The only message from the dead that ever came distinctly through&mdash;<br>
    Was&mdash;&lsquo;Send my overcoat to hell&rsquo;&mdash;it came to Bourke
    in Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>I know they drank, and fought, and died&mdash;some fighting fiends on blazing
    tracks&mdash;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t remember that they lied, or crawled behind each others&rsquo; backs;<br>
    I don&rsquo;t remember that they loafed, or left a mate to battle through&mdash;<br>
    Ah! men knew how to stick to men in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;re scattered wide and scattered far&mdash;by fan-like tracks,
    north, east, and west&mdash;<br>
    The cruel New Australian star drew off the bravest and the best.<br>
    The Cape and Klondyke claim their bones, the streets of London damned a few,<br>
    And jingo-cursed Australia mourns for Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>For ever westward in the land, Australians hear&mdash;and will not heed&mdash;<br>
    The murmur of the board-room, and the sure and stealthy steps of greed&mdash;<br>
    Bourke was a fortress on the track! and garrisons were grim and true<br>
    To hold the spoilers from Out Back, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>I hear it in the ridges lone, and in the dread drought-stricken wild&mdash;<br>
    I hear at times a woman&rsquo;s moan&mdash;the whimper of a hungry child:<br>
    And&mdash;let the cynics say the word: &lsquo;a godless gang, a drunken crew&rsquo;&mdash;<br>
    But these were things I never heard in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>

    quite:<br>
    They don&rsquo;t know how to drink and swear, they&rsquo;ve half forgotten
    how to fight;<br>
    They&rsquo;ve almost lost the strength to trust, the faith in mateship to
    be true&mdash;<br>
    The heart that grew in drought and dust in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>We&rsquo;ve learned to laugh the bitter laugh since then&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
    travelled, you and I;<br>
    The sneaking little paragraph, the dirty trick, the whispered lie<br>
    Are known to us&mdash;the little men&mdash;whose souls are rotten through
    and through&mdash;<br>
    We called them scabs and crawlers then, in Ninety-one and Ninety-two.</p>
  <p>And could I roll the summers back, or bring the dead time on again;<br>
    Or from the grave or world-wide track, call back to Bourke the vanished men,<br>
    With mind content I&rsquo;d go to sleep, and leave those mates to judge me
    true,<br>

    Over tracks that seemed hopeless, by bark hut and tent;<br>

  <p>Now still from the ridges, by ways that are dark,<br>

  <p>Ah, better the thud of the deadly gun, and the crash of the bursting shell,<br>
    Than the terrible silence where drought is fought out there in the western
      hell;<br>
    And better the rattle of rifles near, or the thunder on deck at sea,<br>
    Than the sound&mdash;most hellish of all to hear&mdash;of a fire where it
    should not be.</p>
  <p>On the runs to the west of the Dingo Scrubs there was drought, and ruin,
    and death,<br>
    And the sandstorm came from the dread north-east with the blast of a furnace-breath;<br>
    Till at last one day, at the fierce sunrise, a boundary-rider woke,<br>
    And saw, in the place of the distant haze, a curtain of light blue smoke.</p>
  <p>There is saddling-up by the cockey&rsquo;s hut, and out in the station yard,<br>
    And away to the north, north-east, north-west, the bushmen are riding hard.<br>
    The pickets are out and many a scout, and many a mulga wire,<br>
    While Bill and Jim, with their faces grim, are riding to meet the fire.</p>
  <p>It roars for days in the hopeless scrubs, and across, where the ground seems
    bare,<br>
    With a cackle and hiss, like the hissing of snakes, the fire is travelling
    there;<br>
    Till at last, exhausted by sleeplessness, and the terrible toil and heat,<br>
    The squatter is crying, &lsquo;My God! the wool!&rsquo; and the farmer, &lsquo;My
    God! the wheat!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>But there comes a drunkard (who reels as he rides), with the news from the
    roadside pub:&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Pat Murphy&mdash;the cockey&mdash;cut off by the fire!&mdash;way back
  in the Dingo Scrub!&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Let the wheat and the woolshed go to&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Well, they
  do as each great heart bids;<br>
    They are riding a race for the Dingo Scrub&mdash;for Pat and his wife and
    kids.</p>
  <p>And who is leading the race with death? An ill-matched three, you&rsquo;ll
    allow;<br>
    Flash Jim the breaker and Boozing Bill (who is riding steadily now),<br>
    And Constable Dunn, of the Mounted Police, is riding between the two<br>
    (He wants Flash Jim, but the job can wait till they get the Murphys through).</p>
  <p>As they strike the track through the blazing scrub, the trooper is heard
    to shout:<br>
  &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll take them on to the Two-mile Tank, if we cannot bring them
  out!&rsquo;<br>
    A half-mile more, and the rest rein back, retreating, half-choked, halfblind;<br>
    And the three are gone from the sight of men, and the bush fire roars behind.</p>
  <p>The Bushman wiped the tears of smoke, and like Bushmen wept and swore;<br>
  &lsquo;Poor Bill will be wanting his drink to-night as never he did before.<br>
  &lsquo;And Dunn was the best in the whole damned force!&rsquo; says a client
  of Dunn&rsquo;s, with pride;<br>

    other side.</p>

  <p>It is daylight again, and the fire is past, and the black scrub silent and
    grim,<br>
    Except for the blaze of an old dead tree, or the crash of a falling limb;<br>
    And the Bushmen are riding again on the run, with hearts and with eyes that
    fill,<br>
    To look for the bodies of Constable Dunn, Flash Jim, and Boozing Bill.</p>
  <p>They are found in the mud of the Two-mile Tank, where a fiend might scarce
    survive,<br>
    But the Bushmen gather from words they hear that the bodies are much alive.<br>
    There is Swearing Pat, with his grey beard singed, and his language of lurid
    hue,<br>
    And his tough old wife, and his half-baked kids, and the three who dragged
    them through.</p>
  <p>Old Pat is deploring his burnt-out home, and his wife the climate warm;<br>
    And Jim the loss of his favourite horse, and Dunn his uniform;<br>
    And Boozing Bill, with a raging thirst, is cursing the Dingo Scrub&mdash;<br>
    He&rsquo;ll only ask for the loan of a flask and a lift to the nearest pub.</p>

  <p>He shall&nbsp;live to the end of this mad old world, he has lived since

    He never has done any good for himself, but was good to every man.<br>
    He never has done any good for himself, and I&rsquo;m sure that he never
    will,<br>
    He drinks and he swears and he fights at times, and his name is mostly Bill.</p>
  <p>He carried a freezing mate to his cave, and nursed him, for all I know,<br>
    When Europe was mostly a sheet of ice, thousands of years ago.<br>
    He has stuck to many a mate since then, he is with us everywhere still<br>
    (He loves and gambles when he is young, and the girls stick up for Bill.)</p>
  <p>He has rowed to a wreck, when the lifeboat failed, with Jim in a crazy boat;<br>
    He has given his lifebelt many a time, and sunk that another might float.<br>
    He has &lsquo;stood &rsquo;em off&rsquo; while others escaped, when the niggers
    rushed from the hill,<br>
    And rescue parties who came too late have found what was left of Bill.</p>
  <p>He has thirsted on deserts that others might drink, he has given lest others
    should lack,<br>
    He has staggered half-blinded through fire or drought with a sick man on
    his back.<br>
    He is first to the rescue in tunnel or shaft, from Newcastle to Broken Hill,<br>
    When the water breaks in or the fire breaks out, Oh! a leader of men is Bill.</p>
  <p>No humane societies&rsquo; medals he wears for the fearful deaths he braved;<br>
    He seems ashamed of the good he did, and ashamed of the lives he saved.<br>
    If you chance to know of a noble deed he has done, you had best keep still;<br>
    If you chance to know of a kindly act, you mustn&rsquo;t let on to Bill.</p>
  <p>He is fierce at a wrong, he is firm in right, he is kind to the weak and
    mild;<br>
    He will slave all day and sit up all night by the side of a neighbour&rsquo;s
    child.<br>
    For a woman in trouble he&rsquo;d lay down his life, nor think as another
    man will;<br>
    He&rsquo;s a man all through, but no other man&rsquo;s wife has ever been
    worse for Bill.</p>
  <p>He is good for the noblest sacrifice, he can do what few other men can;<br>
    He can break his heart that the girl he loves may marry a better man.<br>
    There&rsquo;s many a mother and wife to-night whose heart and whose eyes
    will fill<br>
    When she thinks of the days of the long ago when she well might have stuck
    to Bill.</p>
  <p>Maybe he&rsquo;s in trouble or hard up now, and travelling far for work,<br>
    Or fighting a dead past down to-night in a lone camp west of Bourke.<br>
    When he&rsquo;s happy and flush, take your sorrow to him and borrow as much
    as you will;<br>
    But when he&rsquo;s in trouble or stony-broke, you never will hear from Bill.</p>
  <p>And when, because of its million sins, this earth is cracked like a shell,<br>
    He will stand by a mate at the Judgment Seat!&mdash;and comfort him down
    in&mdash;Well,<br>

    Perhaps God will fix up the world again for the sake of the likes of Bill.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Tall-hatted and frock-coated;<br>
  &lsquo;They trained it in from all the towns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The weird and hairy-throated;<br>
  &lsquo;They spoke in some outlandish tongue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They cut some comic capers,<br>
  &lsquo;And ilka man was wild to get<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;His name in all the papers.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They showed no gleam of intellect,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Those frauds who rushed before us;<br>
  &lsquo;They knew one verse of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&mdash;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The first one and the chorus:<br>
  &lsquo;They clacked the clack o&rsquo; Scotlan&rsquo;s Bard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They glibly talked of &ldquo;Rabby;&rdquo;<br>
  &lsquo;But what if he had come to them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Without a groat and shabby?</p>
  <p>&lsquo;They drank and wept for Robbie&rsquo;s sake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They stood and brayed like asses<br>
  &lsquo;(The living bard&rsquo;s a drunken rake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The dead one loved the lasses);<br>
  &lsquo;If Robbie Burns were here, they&rsquo;d sit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;As still as any mouse is;<br>
  &lsquo;If Robbie Burns should come their way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They&rsquo;d turn him out their houses.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Oh, weep for bonny Scotland&rsquo;s bard!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And praise the Scottish nation,<br>
  &lsquo;Who made him spy and let him die<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Heart-broken in privation:<br>
  &lsquo;Exciseman, so that he might live<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Through northern winters&rsquo; rigours&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Just as in southern lands they give<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The hard-up rhymer figures.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;We need some songs of stinging fun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;To wake the States and light &rsquo;em;<br>
  &lsquo;I wish a man like Robert Burns<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Were here to-day to write &rsquo;em!<br>
  &lsquo;But still the mockery shall survive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Till the Day o&rsquo; Judgment crashes&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The men we scorn when we&rsquo;re alive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;With praise insult our ashes.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And Scotty&rsquo;s ghost said: &lsquo;Never mind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The fleas that you inherit;<br>
  &lsquo;The living bard can flick them off&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;They cannot hurt his spirit.<br>
  &lsquo;The crawlers round the bardie&rsquo;s name<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Shall crawl through all the ages;<br>
  &lsquo;His work&rsquo;s the living thing, and they<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Are fly-dirt on the pages.&rsquo;</p>
