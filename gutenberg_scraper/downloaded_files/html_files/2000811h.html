  <p>A&nbsp;son&nbsp;of elder sons I am,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose boyhood days were cramped and scant,<br>
    Through ages of domestic sham<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And family lies and family cant.<br>
    Come, elder brothers mine, and bring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull loads of care that you have won,<br>
    And gather round me while I sing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ballad of the elder son.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas Christ who spake in parables&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To picture man was his intent;<br>
    A simple tale He simply tells,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And He Himself makes no comment.<br>
    A morbid sympathy is felt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For prodigals&mdash;the selfish ones&mdash;<br>
    The crooked world has ever dealt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unjustly by the elder sons.</p>
  <p>The elder son on barren soil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where life is crude and lands are new,<br>
    Must share the father&rsquo;s hardest toil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And share the father&rsquo;s troubles too.<br>
    With no child-thoughts to meet his own<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His childhood is a lonely one:<br>
    The youth his father might have known<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is seldom for the eldest son.</p>
  <p>It seems so strange, but fate is grim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Heaven&rsquo;s ways are hard to track,<br>
    Though ten young scamps come after him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rod falls heaviest on his back.<br>
    And, well I&rsquo;ll say it might be caused<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a half-sense of injustice done&mdash;<br>
    That vague resentment parents feel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So oft towards the eldest son.</p>
  <p>He, too, must bear the father&rsquo;s name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He loves his younger brother, too,<br>
    And feels the younger brother&rsquo;s shame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As keenly as his parents do.<br>
    The mother&rsquo;s prayers, the father&rsquo;s curse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sister&rsquo;s tears have all been done&mdash;<br>
    We seldom see in prose or verse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayers of the elder son.</p>
  <p>But let me to the parable<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With eyes on facts but fancy free;<br>
    And don&rsquo;t belie me if I tell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story as it seems to me&mdash;<br>
    For, mind, I do not mean to sneer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I was religious when a child),<br>
    I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Christ himself had sometimes smiled.</p>
  <p>A certain squatter had two sons<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up Canaan way some years ago.<br>
    The graft was hard on those old runs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was hot and life was slow.<br>
    The younger brother coolly claimed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion that he hadn&rsquo;t earned,<br>
    And sought the &lsquo;life&rsquo; for which untamed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And high young spirits always yearned.</p>
  <p>A year or so he knocked about,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spent his cheques on girls and wine,<br>
    And, getting stony in the drought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a job at herding swine,<br>
    And though he is a hog that swigs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fools with girls till all is blue&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas rather rough to shepherd pigs<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And have to eat their tucker too.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When he came to himself,&rdquo; he said<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I take my Bible from the shelf:<br>
    There&rsquo;s nothing like a feed of husks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring a young man to himself.<br>
    And when you&rsquo;re done with wine and girls&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here a moral seems to shine&mdash;<br>
    And are hard up, you&rsquo;ll find no pearls<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are cast by friends before your swine)&mdash;</p>
  <p>When he came to himself, he said&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reckoned pretty shrewdly, too&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;The rousers in my father&rsquo;s shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Have got more grub than they can chew;<br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve been a fool, but such is fate&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll talk the guv&rsquo;nor round:<br>
  &lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve acted cronk,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll tell him straight;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;(He&rsquo;s had his time too, I&rsquo;ll be
  bound).</p>
  <p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him straight I&rsquo;ve had my fling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been on
  the beer,<br>
  &lsquo;&ldquo;But put me on at anything,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll graft with any bounder here.&rdquo;&rsquo;<br>
    He rolled his swag and struck for home&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was by this time pretty slim<br>
    And, when the old man saw him come&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you know how he welcomed him.</p>
  <p>They&rsquo;ve brought the best robe in the house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ring, and killed the fatted calf,<br>
    And now they hold a grand carouse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eat and drink and dance and laugh:<br>
    And from the field the elder son&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose character is not admired&mdash;<br>
    Comes plodding home when work is done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And very hot and very tired.</p>
  <p>He asked the meaning of the sound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such unwonted revelry,<br>
    They said his brother had been &lsquo;found&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He&rsquo;d found himself it seemed to me);<br>
  &rsquo;Twas natural in the elder son<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take the thing a little hard<br>
    And brood on what was past and done<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While standing outside in the yard.</p>
  <p>Now he was hungry and knocked out<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And would, if they had let him be,<br>
    Have rested and cooled down, no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And hugged his brother after tea,<br>
    And welcomed him and hugged his dad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And filled the wine cup to the brim&mdash;<br>
    But, just when he was feeling bad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man came and tackled him.</p>
  <p>He well might say with bitter tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While music swelled and flowed the wine&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Lo, I have served thee many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Nor caused thee one grey hair of thine.<br>
  &lsquo;Whate&rsquo;er thou bad&rsquo;st me do I did<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;And for my brother made amends;<br>
  &lsquo;Thou never gavest me a kid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;That I might make merry with my friends.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>(He was no honest clod and glum<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could not trespass, sing nor dance&mdash;<br>
    He could be merry with a chum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed, if he had half a chance;<br>
    Perhaps, if further light we seek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He knew&mdash;and herein lay the sting&mdash;<br>
    His brother would clear out next week<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And promptly pop the robe and ring).</p>
  <p>The father said, &lsquo;The wandering one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The lost is found, this son of mine,<br>
  &lsquo;But thou art always with me, son&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Thou knowest all I have is thine.&rsquo;<br>
    (It seemed the best robe and the ring,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love and fatted calf were not;<br>
    But this was just a little thing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The old man in his joy forgot.)</p>
  <p>The father&rsquo;s blindness in the house,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mother&rsquo;s fond and foolish way<br>
    Have caused no end of ancient rows<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right back to Cain and Abel&rsquo;s day.<br>
    The world will blame the eldest born&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But&mdash;well, when all is said and done,<br>
    No coat has ever yet been worn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That had no colour more than one.</p>
  <p>Oh! if I had the power to teach&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strength for which my spirit craves&mdash;<br>
    The cant of parents I would preach<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slave and make their children slaves.<br>
    For greed of gain, and that alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their youth they steal, their hearts they break<br>
    And then, the wretched misers moan&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;We did it for our children&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&lsquo;And all I have&rsquo;&mdash;the paltry bribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he might slave contented yet<br>
    While envied by his selfish tribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The birthright he might never get:<br>
    The worked-out farm and endless graft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mortgaged home, the barren run&mdash;<br>
    The heavy, hopeless overdraft&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The portion of the elder son.</p>
  <p>He keeps his parents when they&rsquo;re old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He keeps a sister in distress,<br>
    His wife must work and care for them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bear with all their pettishness.<br>
    The mother&rsquo;s moan is ever heard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, whining for the worthless one,<br>
    She seldom has a kindly word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To say about her eldest son.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis he, in spite of sneer and jibe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who stands the friend when others fail:<br>
    He bears the burdens of his tribe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And keeps his brother out of jail.<br>
    He lends the quid and pays the fine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the family pride he smarts&mdash;<br>
    For reasons I cannot divine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate him in their heart of hearts.</p>
  <p>A satire on this world of sin&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where parents seldom understand&mdash;<br>
    That night the angels gathered in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firstborn of that ancient land.<br>
    Perhaps they thought, in those old camps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While suffering for the blow that fell,<br>
    They might have better spared the scamps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Josephs that they loved so well.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the Eldest takes the track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things at home have got too bad&mdash;<br>
    He comes not crawling, canting back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To seek the blind side of his dad.<br>
    He always finds a knife and fork<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meat between on which to dine,<br>
    And, though he sometimes deals in pork,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll never catch him herding swine.</p>
  <p>The happy home, the overdraft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His birthright and his prospects gay,<br>
    And likewise his share of the graft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaves the rest to grab. And they&mdash;<br>
    Who&rsquo;d always do the thing by halves,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything for him was done&mdash;<br>
    Would kill a score of fatted calves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To welcome home the eldest son.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThePrideThatComesAfter"></a>The Pride That Comes After</b></h2>
  <p>It knows&nbsp;it all, it knows it all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of groans and laughter,<br>
    It sneers of pride before a fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the bitter pride comes after:<br>
    So leave me and I&rsquo;ll seek you not,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So seek me and you&rsquo;ll find me&mdash;<br>
    But till I know your hand-grip&rsquo;s true<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll stand with hands behind me.</p>
  <p>It knows it all, it knows it all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world of lies and sorrow&mdash;<br>
    It prates of pride before a fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And of the humble morrow;<br>
    But shame and blame are but a name,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, heart that&rsquo;s hurt past curing!<br>
    We&rsquo;ll drink to-night the sinner&rsquo;s pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride that&rsquo;s most enduring.</p>
  <p>They know it all, they know it all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curs that pass the sentence.<br>
    They preach of pride before a fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter black repentance:<br>
    So leave me when my star is set,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll glory that you leave me,<br>
    While one has pride to love me yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s nought on earth shall grieve me.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AVoicefromtheCity"></a>A Voice from the City</b></h2>
  <p>On&nbsp;western plain and eastern hill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once my fancy ranged,<br>
    The station hands are riding still<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are little changed.<br>
    But I have lost in London gloom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glory of the day,<br>
    The grand perfume of wattle bloom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is faint and far away.</p>
  <p>Brown faces under broad-brimmed hats<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grip of wiry hands,<br>
    The gallops on the frosty flats,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem dreams of other lands;<br>
    The camp fire and the stars that blaze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above the mystic plain<br>
    Are but the thoughts of vanished days<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That never come again.</p>
  <p>The evening star I seldom view&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That led me on to roam&mdash;<br>
    I never see the morning star<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That used to draw me home.<br>
    But I have often longed for day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hide the few I see,<br>
    Because they only point and say<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most bitter things to me.</p>
  <p>I wear my life on pavement stones<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That drag me ever down,<br>
    A paltry slave to little things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By custom chained to town.<br>
    I&rsquo;ve lost the strength to strike alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart to do and dare&mdash;<br>
    I mind the day I&rsquo;d roll my swag<br>

  <p>When I should wait I wander out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I should go I bide&mdash;<br>
    I scarcely dare to think about<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The days when I could ride.<br>
    I would not mount before his eyes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Straight&rsquo; Bushman tall and tan&mdash;<br>
    I mind the day when I stood up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fought him like a man.</p>
  <p>I mind the time when I was shy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To meet the brown Bush girls&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;ve lunched with lords since then and I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been at home with earls:<br>
    I learned to smile and learned to bow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lie to ladies gay&mdash;<br>
    But to a gaunt Bushwoman now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d not know what to say.</p>
  <p>And if I sought her hard bare home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From scenes of show and sham,<br>
    I&rsquo;d sit all ill at ease and feel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The poor weak thing I am.<br>
    I could not meet her hopeless eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That look one through and through,<br>
    The haggard woman of the past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who once thought I was true.</p>
  <p>But nought on earth can last for aye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wild with care and pain,<br>
    Some day by chance I&rsquo;ll break away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seek the Bush again.<br>
    And find awhile from bitter years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest the Bush can bring,<br>
    And hear, perhaps, with truer ears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The songs it has to sing.</p>

  <p>&rsquo;Tis&nbsp;no tale of heroism, &rsquo;tis no tale of storm and strife,<br>
    But of ordinary boozing, and of dull domestic life&mdash;<br>
    Of the everlasting friction that most husbands must endure&mdash;<br>
    Tale of nagging and of drinking&mdash;and a secret whisky cure.</p>
  <p>Name of Jones&mdash;perhaps you know him&mdash;small house-agent here in
    town&mdash;<br>
    (Friend of Smith, you know him also&mdash;likewise Robinson and Brown),<br>
    Just a hopeless little husband, whose deep sorrows were obscure,<br>
    And a bitter nagging Missis&mdash;and death seemed the only cure.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas a common sordid marriage, and there&rsquo;s little new to tell&mdash;<br>
    Save the pub to him was Heaven and his own home was a hell:<br>
    With the office in between them&mdash;purgatory to be sure&mdash;<br>
    And, as far as Jones could make out&mdash;well, there wasn&rsquo;t any cure.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas drink and nag&mdash;or nag and drink&mdash;whichever you prefer&mdash;<br>
    Till at last she couldn&rsquo;t stand him any more than he could her.<br>
    Friends and relatives assisted, telling her (with motives pure)<br>
    That a legal separation was the only earthly cure.</p>
  <p>So she went and saw a lawyer, who, in accents soft and low,<br>
    Asked her firstly if her husband had a bank account or no;<br>
    But he hadn&rsquo;t and she hadn&rsquo;t, they in fact were very poor,<br>
    So he bowed her out suggesting she should try some liquor cure.</p>
  <p>She saw a drink cure advertised in the Sydney&nbsp;<i>Bulletin</i>&mdash;<br>
    Cure for brandy, cure for whisky, cure for rum and beer and gin,<br>
    And it could be given secret, it was tasteless, swift and sure&mdash;<br>
    So she purchased half a gallon of that Secret Whisky Cure.</p>
  <p>And she put some in his coffee, smiling sweetly all the while,<br>
    And he started for the office rather puzzled by the smile&mdash;<br>
    Smile or frown he&rsquo;d have a whisky, and you&rsquo;ll say he was a boor&mdash;<br>
    But perhaps his wife had given him an overdose of Cure.</p>
  <p>And he met a friend he hadn&rsquo;t seen for seven years or more&mdash;<br>
    It was just upon the threshold of a private bar-room door&mdash;<br>
    And they coalised and entered straight away, you may be sure&mdash;<br>
    But of course they hadn&rsquo;t reckoned with a Secret Whisky Cure.</p>
  <p>Jones, he drank, turned pale, and, gasping, hurried out the back way quick,<br>
    Where, to his old chum&rsquo;s amazement, he was violently sick;<br>
    Then they interviewed the landlord, but he swore the drink was pure&mdash;<br>
    It was only the beginning of the Secret Whisky Cure.</p>
  <p>For Jones couldn&rsquo;t stand the smell of even special whisky blends,<br>
    And shunned bar-rooms to the sorrow of his trusty drinking friends:<br>
    And they wondered, too, what evil genius had chanced to lure<br>
    Him from paths of booze and friendship&mdash;never dreaming of a Cure.</p>
  <p>He had noticed, too, with terror that a something turned his feet,<br>
    When a pub was near, and swung him to the other side the street,<br>
    Till he thought the devils had him, and his person they&rsquo;d immure<br>
    In a lunatic asylum where there wasn&rsquo;t any Cure.</p>
  <p>He consulted several doctors who were puzzled by the case&mdash;<br>
    As they mostly are, but never tell the patient to his face&mdash;<br>
    Some advised him &lsquo;Try the Mountains for this malady obscure:&rsquo;<br>
    But there wasn&rsquo;t one could diagnose a Secret Whisky Cure.</p>
  <p>And his wife, when he was sober?&mdash;Well, she nagged him all the more!<br>
    And he couldn&rsquo;t drown his sorrow in the pewter as of yore:<br>
    So he shot himself at Manly and was sat upon by Woore,<br>
    And found rest amongst the spirits from the Secret Whisky Cure.</p>

  <p>I&nbsp;was&nbsp;welcome in a palace when the ball was at my feet,<br>
    I was petted in a garden and my triumph was complete.<br>
    But for me above the alleys there forever shone a star,<br>
    Where the third-rate public houses and the dens of Venus are.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the third-rate public
  houses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fourth-rate lodging
  houses,<br>
    And the rag-shops and the pawn-shops and the dens of Venus are.</p>
  <p>I was born among the alleys, bred in darkness and in doubt,<br>
    And I wrote the truth in blindness and I struggled up and out;<br>
    And the world was fair before me and the way was wide and plain,<br>
    But the spirit of the alleys ever dragged me back again.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis a madness I inherit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a blind and reckless spirit.<br>
    Oh! the spirit of the alleys ever drags me down again!</p>
  <p>There were fair girls in the garden where the spring came in a day,<br>
    But the barmaids in the alleys know a wider world than they.<br>
    There were wise men in the palace who were born to rule the earth,<br>
    But the wrecks amongst the alleys know the world for what it&rsquo;s worth.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the pewter from the chalice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the slum from the palace,<br>
    Aye! the wrecks sunk in the alleys know the world for what it&rsquo;s worth!</p>
  <p>Poets who have done with puzzling&mdash;men who talk but dare not think&mdash;<br>
    Men who might have moulded nations had it not been for the drink!<br>
    Wicked stories full of humour&mdash;shafts of wit that seldom miss,<br>
    Shot from blighted lips of women that the bravest dare not kiss?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the worst girl lead the
  revels<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the reckless alley devils!&mdash;<br>
    Pure and virtuous women often, often drive men down to this.</p>
  <p>In the days of mental torture when my life was all a hell,<br>
    It was down amongst the alleys that I learnt the tales I tell,<br>
    From the black-sheep out from England, from the boozer in from Bourke,<br>
    From the tired haggard women bending over needle-work:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales of wrongs, that fire
  the spirit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tales of more than human merit,<br>
    Told in quiet tones and measured, bending over needle-work.</p>
  <p>Oh! the pathos and the humour of the shifts of poverty,<br>
    Oh! the sympathy of drunkards, wit and truth and charity,<br>
    Oh! the worn-out working women and the lives that they endure,<br>
    And the hard and callous kindness of the poor unto the poor!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Where they blame not&mdash;those
  who labour&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the prostitute&rsquo;s
  a neighbour)<br>
    Ah! the humour and the courage and the kindness of the poor!</p>
  <p>There is fire down in the alleys that has smouldered very long;<br>
    There is hatred in the alleys born of centuries of wrong;<br>
    And no prayer wins to heaven like a prayer from the slums,<br>
    And the thrones of empire totter when the alleys beat their drums.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ah! the world is very rotten!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my sins shall be forgotten<br>
    And my work shall be remembered when the alleys beat their drums.)</p>
  <p>It is down amongst the alleys, in the alleys dull and damp,<br>
    They find kindness in a scoundrel, they find good points in a scamp.<br>
    It is down amongst the alleys, now my star has ceased to shine,<br>
    I find sympathy with sinners and can hide what shame is mine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we trust and shield each
  other<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a sinner is a brother&mdash;<br>
    There are souls amongst the alleys who were lost the same as mine.</p>
  <p>And if you should some day miss me, and should care to wonder why,<br>
    Ask for me amongst the alleys by the name they knew me by:<br>
    Mind your head and pick your footsteps for you&rsquo;ll grope in alley gloom,<br>
    And the stairs are steep and narrow where they&rsquo;ll lead you to a room.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if floors are foul and
  dusty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the air is close and musty?<br>
    In the days when I was noble then I wrote in such a room.</p>
  <p>You will see a chair and table dimly shown by candle light,<br>
    And the pen I dropped for ever from the last line I shall write;<br>
    And some poor attempts at comfort, and a bottle&mdash;and maybe<br>
    You will find a bad girl crying over what is left of me:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call no friends&mdash;I shall
  not need them;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those in sorrow&rsquo;s ways;<br>
    I often wish my heart could break<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it did in those dead days.</p>
  <p>Along my track of storm and stress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is plain to trace,<br>
    I look back from the loneliness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the depth of my disgrace.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas fate and only fate I know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all mistakes are plain,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis sadder than the afterglow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More dreary than the rain.</p>
  <p>But still there lies a patch of sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That ne&rsquo;er will come again,<br>
    Those golden days when I was one<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen.<br>
    And if there is a memory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could break me down at last,<br>
    It sure would be the thought of this,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine in the past.</p>
  <p>But &rsquo;spite of sunshine on the track&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well the sun might shine&mdash;<br>
    My heart grows hard when I look back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From these dark days of mine.<br>
    A nobler child was never born<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all the Southern land&mdash;<br>
    The slave of selfish ignorance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could not understand.</p>
  <p>Oh, I had lived for many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a world of my ideal,<br>
    With no false laughter, no false tears,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it seemed very real.<br>
    But I was wakened from my dreams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learnt with hardening eyes<br>
    A world of selfish treachery,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of paltry shame and lies.</p>
  <p>I left the truest friends on earth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did not need my aid,<br>
    And worked for those who were not worth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sacrifice I made.<br>
    And while I blindly strove to raise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The coward and the clown,<br>
    They sneaked behind by shady ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tore my palace down.</p>
  <p>But let those faithless friends of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&rsquo;d think of me with scorn,<br>
    Remember that for many years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heavy load I&rsquo;ve borne.<br>
    And my true friends when all is done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my sad soul is gone,<br>
    Will think of battles I have won<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I lead rivals on.</p>
  <p>And though from spite and worldly things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I well should be exempt,<br>
    For little men and paltry men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I scarce can feel contempt.<br>
    They followed me with flattery<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the days when I was brave&mdash;<br>
    But for those who have been true to me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll strike back from the grave!</p>

    A poet had written his epitaph in numbers of sad regret,<br>
    And the passing-notice was pigeon-holed, and the last review was set.</p>
  <p>But the strength was in him to rise again to a greater height, he knew,<br>
    For the sake of the friends who were true to him and the work that he had
      to do;<br>

    It is General Greybeard Shrapnel who is riding round his lines.</p>
  <p>And the scarecrows from the trenches, haggard eyes and hollow cheeks,<br>
    War-stained uniforms and ragged that have not been off for weeks;<br>
    They salute him and they cheer him and they watch his face for signs;<br>
    Ah! they try to read old Greybeard while he&rsquo;s riding round the lines.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s a crack, crack, crack and rattle; there&rsquo;s a thud and
    there&rsquo;s a crash;<br>
    In the battery over yonder there is something gone to smash,<br>
    Then a hush and sudden movement, and its meaning he divines,<br>
    And he patches up a blunder while he&rsquo;s riding round his lines.</p>
  <p>Pushing this position forward, bringing that position back,<br>
    While his officers, with orders, ride like hell down hell&rsquo;s own track;<br>
    Making hay&mdash;and to what purpose?&mdash;while his sun of winter shines,<br>
    But his work is just beginning when he&rsquo;s ridden round his lines.</p>
  <p>There are fifty thousand rifles and a hundred batteries<br>
    All a-playing battle music, with his fingers on the keys,<br>
    And if for an hour, exhausted, on his camp bed he reclines,<br>
    In his mind he still is riding&mdash;he is riding round his lines.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;s the brains of fifty thousand, blundering at their country&rsquo;s
    call;<br>
    He&rsquo;s the one hope of his nation, and the loneliest man of all;<br>
    He is flesh and blood and human, though he never shews the signs:<br>
    He is General Greybeard Shrapnel who is fixing up his lines.</p>
  <p>It is thankless work and weary, and, for all his neighbour knows,<br>
    He may sometimes feel as if he doesn&rsquo;t half care how it goes;<br>
    But for all that can be gathered from his eyes of steely blue<br>
    He might be a great contractor who has some big job to do.</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s the son who died in action&mdash;it may be a week ago;<br>
    There&rsquo;s the wife and other troubles that most men have got to know&mdash;<br>
    (And we&rsquo;ll say the grey-haired mother underneath the porch of vines):<br>
    Does he ever think of these things while he&rsquo;s riding round his lines?</p>
  <p>He is bossed by bitter boobies who can never understand;<br>
    He is hampered by the asses and the robbers of the land,<br>
    And I feel inclined to wonder what his own opinions are<br>
    Of the Government, the country, of the war and of the Czar.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;s the same when he&rsquo;s advancing, he&rsquo;s the same in grim
    retreat;<br>
    For he wears one mask in triumph and the same mask in defeat;<br>
    Of the brave he is the bravest, he is strongest of the strong:<br>
    General Greybeard Shrapnel never shows that anything is wrong.</p>
  <p>But we each and all are lonely, and we have our work to do;<br>
    We must fight for wife and children or our country and our screw<br>
    In the everlasting struggle to the end that fate destines;<br>
    In the war that men call living we are riding round our lines.</p>
  <p>I ride round my last defences, where the bitter jibes are flung,<br>
    I am patching up the blunders that I made when I was young,<br>
    And I may be digging pitfalls and I may be laying mines;<br>
    For I sometimes feel like Shrapnel while I&rsquo;m riding round my lines.</p>

    Shall they marry and bear children to their parents&rsquo; martyrdom?<br>
    Make the city what it should be&mdash;and the bairns will come.</p>
  <p>Shall we give you sons and daughters to a life of never-rest,<br>
    Sacrificing all for nothing in the desert of the West,<br>
    To be driven to the city&rsquo;s squalid suburb and the slum?<br>
    Make the city what it should be&mdash;and the bairns will come.</p>
  <p>Don&rsquo;t you hear Australia calling for her children unconceived?<br>
    Don&rsquo;t you hear them calling to her while her heart is very grieved?<br>
    Give the best land to the farmers, make the barren West a home,<br>
    Save the rainfall, lock the rivers&mdash;and the bairns will come.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHeartofAustralia"></a>The Heart of Australia</b></h2>
  <p>When&nbsp;the wars of the world seemed ended, and silent the distant drum,<br>
    Ten years ago in Australia, I wrote of a war to come:<br>
    And I pictured Australians fighting as their fathers fought of old<br>
    For the old things, pride or country, for God or the Devil or gold.</p>
  <p>And they lounged on the rim of Australia in the peace that had come to last,<br>
    And they laughed at my &lsquo;cavalry charges&rsquo; for such things belonged
    to the past;<br>
    Then our wise men smiled with indulgence&mdash;ere the swift years proved
    me right&mdash;<br>
    Saying: &lsquo;What shall Australia fight for? And whom shall Australia fight?&rsquo;</p>
  <p>I wrote of the unlocked rivers in the days when my heart was full,<br>
    And I pleaded for irrigation where they sacrifice all for wool.<br>
    I pictured Australia fighting when the coast had been lost and won&mdash;<br>
    With arsenals west of the mountains and every spur its gun.</p>
  <p>And what shall Australia fight for? The reason may yet be found,<br>
    When strange shells scatter the wickets and burst on the football ground.<br>
    And &lsquo;Who shall invade Australia?&rsquo; let the wisdom of ages say<br>
  &lsquo;The friend of a further future&mdash;or the ally of yesterday!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>Aye! What must Australia fight for? In the strife that never shall cease,<br>
    She must fight for her work unfinished: she must fight for her life and peace,<br>
    For the sins of the older nations. She must fight for her own reward.<br>
  <i>She has taken the sword in her blindness and shall live or die by the sword.</i></p>
  <p>But the statesman, the churchman, the scholar still peer through their glasses
    dim<br>
    And they see no cloud on the future as they roost on Australia&rsquo;s rim:<br>
    Where the farmer works with the lumpers and the drover drives a dray,<br>
    And the shearer on Garden Island is shifting a hill to-day.</p>
  <p>Had we used the wealth we have squandered and the land that we kept from
    the plough,<br>
    A prosperous Federal City would be over the mountains now,<br>
    With farms that sweep to horizons and gardens where plains lay bare,<br>
    And the bulk of the population and the Heart of Australia there.</p>
  <p>Had we used the time we have wasted and the gold we have thrown away,<br>
    The pick of the world&rsquo;s mechanics would be over the range to-day&mdash;<br>
    In the Valley of Coal and Iron where the breeze from the bush comes down,<br>
    And where thousands of makers of all things should be happy in Factory Town.</p>
  <p>They droned on the rim of Australia, the wise men who never could learn;<br>
    Our substance we sent to the nations, and their shoddy we bought in return.<br>
    In the end, shall our soldiers fight naked, no help for them under the sun&mdash;<br>
    And never a cartridge to stick in the breech of a Brummagem gun?</p>
  <p>With the Wars of the World coming near us the wise men are waking today.<br>
    Hurry out ammunition from England! Mount guns on the cliffs while you may!<br>
    And God pardon our sins as a people if Invasion&rsquo;s unmerciful hand<br>
    Should strike at the heart of Australia drought-cramped on the verge of the
    land.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheGoodSamaritan"></a>The Good Samaritan</b></h2>
  <p>He comes&nbsp;from out the ages dim&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Samaritan;<br>
    I somehow never pictured him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fat and jolly man;<br>
    But one who&rsquo;d little joy to glean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little coin to give&mdash;<br>
    A sad-faced man, and lank and lean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who found it hard to live.</p>
  <p>His eyes were haggard in the drought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair was iron-grey&mdash;<br>
    His dusty gown was patched, no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where we patch pants to-day.<br>
    His faded turban, too, was torn&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But darned and folded neat,<br>
    And leagues of desert sand had worn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sandals on his feet.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;s been a fool, perhaps, and would<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have prospered had he tried,<br>
    But he was one who never could<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pass by the other side.<br>
    An honest man whom men called soft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While laughing in their sleeves&mdash;<br>
    No doubt in business ways he oft<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had fallen amongst thieves.</p>
  <p>And, I suppose, by track and tent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And other ancient ways,<br>
    He drank, and fought, and loved, and went<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pace in his young days.<br>
    And he had known the bitter year<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When love and friendship fail&mdash;<br>
    I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he had been in jail.</p>
  <p>A silent man, whose passions slept,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had no friends or foes&mdash;<br>
    A quiet man, who always kept<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hopes and sorrows close.<br>
    A man who very seldom smiled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And one who could not weep<br>
    Be it for death of wife or child<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or sorrow still more deep.</p>
  <p>But sometimes when a man would rave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of wrong, as sinners do,<br>
    He&rsquo;d say to cheer and make him brave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had my troubles too.&rsquo;<br>
    (They might be twittered by the birds,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And breathed high Heaven through,<br>
    There&rsquo;s beauty in those world-old words:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had my sorrows too.&rsquo;)</p>
  <p>And if he was a married man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As many are that roam,<br>
    I guess that good Samaritan<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was rather glum at home,<br>
    Impatient when a child would fret,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strict at times and grim&mdash;<br>
    A man whose kinsmen never yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appreciated him.</p>
  <p>Howbeit&mdash;in a study brown&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had for all we know,<br>
    His own thoughts as he journeyed down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The road to Jericho,<br>
    And pondered, as we puzzle yet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On tragedies of life&mdash;<br>
    And maybe he was deep in debt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And parted from his wife.</p>
  <p>(And so &lsquo;by chance there came that way,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reads not like romance&mdash;<br>
    The truest friends on earth to-day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They mostly come by chance.)<br>
    He saw a stranger left by thieves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sore hurt and like to die&mdash;<br>
    He also saw (my heart believes)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others pass him by.</p>
  <p>(Perhaps that good Samaritan<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knew Levite well, and priest)<br>
    He lifted up the wounded man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat him on his beast,<br>
    And took him on towards the inn&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Christ-like unawares&mdash;<br>
    Still pondering, perhaps, on sin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And virtue&mdash;and his cares.</p>
  <p>He bore him in and fixed him right<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Helped by the local drunk),<br>
    And wined and oiled him well all night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thought beside his bunk.<br>
    And on the morrow ere he went<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He left a quid and spoke<br>
    Unto the host in terms which meant&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Look after that poor bloke.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He must have known them at the inn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They must have known him too&mdash;<br>
    Perhaps on that same track he&rsquo;d seen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some other sick mate through;<br>
    For &lsquo;Whatsoe&rsquo;er thou spendest more&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The parable is plain)<br>
  &lsquo;I will repay,&rsquo; he told the host,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;When I return again.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>He seemed to be a good sort, too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boss of that old pub&mdash;<br>
    (As even now there are a few<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At shanties in the scrub).<br>
    The good Samaritan jogged on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through Canaan&rsquo;s dust and heat,<br>
    And pondered over various schemes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ways to make ends meet.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>He was no Christian, understand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Christ had not been born&mdash;<br>
  <i>He</i>&nbsp;journeyed later through the land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold the priests to scorn;<br>
    And tell the world of &lsquo;certain men&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like that Samaritan,<br>
    And preach the simple creed again&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man&rsquo;s duty! Man to man!</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>&lsquo;Once on a time there lived a man,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he has lived alway,<br>
    And that gaunt, good Samaritan<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is with us here to-day;<br>
    He passes through the city streets<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unnoticed and unknown,<br>
    He helps the sinner that he meets&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sorrows are his own.</p>
  <p>He shares his tucker on the track<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When things are at their worst<br>
    (And often shouts in bars outback<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For souls that are athirst).<br>
    To-day I see him staggering down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blazing water-course,<br>
    And making for the distant town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sick man on his horse.</p>
  <p>He&rsquo;ll live while nations find their graves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mortals suffer pain&mdash;<br>
    When colour rules and whites are slaves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And savages again.<br>
    And, after all is past and done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll rise up, the Last Man,<br>
    From tending to the last but one&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The good Samaritan.</p>

    Where the poet&rsquo;s heart is speaking to their hearts in every line,<br>
    Till the hardest curse and blubber at the thoughts of Auld Lang Syne;<br>
    Then a boozer lurches forward with an oath for all disguise&mdash;<br>
    Prayers and curses in his soul, and tears and liquor in his eyes&mdash;<br>
    Grasps the singer or reciter with a death-grip by the hand:<br>
  &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the truth, bloke! Sling it at &rsquo;em! Oh! Gorbli&rsquo;me,

    For the line of least resistance to the hearts of men he knows;<br>
    And he tracks their hearts in mateship, and he tracks them out alone&mdash;<br>
    Seeking for the power to sway them, till he finds it in his own,<br>
    Feels what they feel, loves what they love, learns to hate what they condemn,<br>
    Takes his pen in tears and triumph, and he writes it down for them.</p>

    I am out on the wallaby humping my drum,<br>
    And I came by the tracks where the sundowners come.</p>
  <p>It is nor&rsquo;-west and west o&rsquo;er the ranges and far<br>
    To the plains where the cattle and sheep stations are,<br>
    With the sky for my roof and the grass for my bunk,<br>
    And a calico bag for my damper and junk;<br>
    And scarcely a comrade my memory reveals,<br>
    Save the spiritless dingo in tow of my heels.</p>
  <p>But I think of the honest old light of my home<br>
    When the stars hang in clusters like lamps from the dome,<br>
    And I think of the hearth where the dark shadows fall,<br>
    When my camp fire is built on the widest of all;<br>
    But I&rsquo;m following Fate, for I know she knows best,<br>
    I follow, she leads, and it&rsquo;s nor&rsquo;-west by west.</p>

    He can hump his old bluey up country again.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBrassWell"></a>The Brass Well</b></h2>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis&nbsp;a legend of the bushmen from the days of Cunningham,<br>
    When he opened up the country and the early squatters came.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the old tale of a fortune missed by men who did seek,<br>
    And, perhaps, you haven&rsquo;t heard it&mdash;The Brass Well on Myall Creek.</p>
  <p>They were north of running rivers, they were south of Queensland rains,<br>
    And a blazing drought was scorching every grass-blade from the plains;<br>
    So the stockmen drove the cattle to the range where there was grass,<br>
    And a couple sunk a well and found what they believed was brass.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Here&rsquo;s some bloomin&rsquo; brass!&rsquo; they muttered when
    they found it in the clay,<br>
    And they thought no more about it and in time they went away;<br>
    But they heard of gold, and saw it, somewhere down by Inverell,<br>
    And they felt and weighed it, crying: &lsquo;Why! we found it in the well!&rsquo;</p>
  <p>And they worked about the station and at times they took the track,<br>
    Always meaning to save money, always meaning to go back&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Always meanin&rsquo;,&rsquo; like the bushmen, who go drifting round
  like wrecks,<br>
    And they&rsquo;d get half way to Myall, strike a pub and blew their cheques.</p>
  <p>Then they told two more about it and those other two grew old,<br>
    And they never found the brass well and they never found the gold.<br>
    For the scrub grows dense and quickly and, though many went to seek,<br>
    No one ever struck the lost track to the Well on Myall Creek.</p>
  <p>And the story is forgotten and I&rsquo;m sitting here, alas!<br>
    With a woeful load of trouble and a woeful lack of brass;<br>
    But I dream at times that I might find what many went to seek,<br>
    And my luck might lead my footsteps to the Well at Myall Creek.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Eureka"></a>Eureka</b></h2>
  <p align="center" class="note">(A Fragment)</p>
  <p>Roll up, Eureka&rsquo;s heroes, on that grand Old Rush afar,<br>
    For Lalor&rsquo;s gone to join you in the big camp where you are;<br>
    Roll up and give him welcome such as only diggers can,<br>
    For well he battled for the rights of miner and of man.<br>
    And there, in that bright, golden land that lies beyond our sight,<br>
    The record of his honest life shall be his Miner&rsquo;s Right.<br>
    Here many a bearded mouth shall twitch, and many a tear be shed,<br>
    And many a grey old digger sigh to hear that Lalor&rsquo;s dead.<br>
    But wipe your eyes, old fossickers, o&rsquo;er worked-out fields that roam,<br>
    You need not weep at parting from a digger going home.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>Now from the strange wild seasons past, the days of golden strife,<br>
    Now from the Roaring Fifties comes a scene from Lalor&rsquo;s life:<br>
    All gleaming white amid the shafts o&rsquo;er gully, hill, and flat<br>
    Again I see the tents that form the camp at Ballarat.<br>
    I hear the shovels and the picks, and all the air is rife<br>
    With the rattle of the cradles and the sounds of digger-life;<br>
    The clatter of the windlass-boles, as spinning round they go,<br>
    And then the signal to his mate, the digger&rsquo;s cry, &lsquo;Below!&rsquo;<br>
    From many a busy pointing forge the sound of labour swells,<br>
    The tinkling at the anvils is as clear as silver bells.</p>
  <p>I hear the broken English from the mouth at least of one<br>
    From every state and nation that is known beneath the sun;<br>
    The homely tongue of Scotland and the brogue of Ireland blend<br>
    With the dialects of England, from Berwick to Land&rsquo;s End;<br>
    And to the busy concourse here the West has sent a part,<br>
    The land of gulches that has been immortalised by&nbsp;Harte;<br>
    The land where long from mining-camps the blue smoke upward curled;<br>
    The land that gave that &lsquo;Partner&rsquo; true and &lsquo;Mliss&rsquo; unto
    the world;<br>
    The men from all the nations in the New World and the Old,<br>
    All side by side, like brethren here, are delving after gold;<br>
    But suddenly the warning cries are heard on every side<br>
    As, closing in around the field, a ring of troopers ride;<br>
    Unlicensed diggers are the game, their class and want are sins,<br>
    And so, with all its shameful scenes, the digger-hunt begins;<br>
    The men are seized who are too poor the heavy tax to pay,<br>
    And they are chained, as convicts were, and dragged in gangs away;<br>
    While in the eye of many a mate is menace scarcely hid&mdash;<br>
    The digger&rsquo;s blood was slow to boil, but scalded when it did.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>But now another match is held that sure must light the charge,<br>
    A digger murdered in the camp! his murderer at large!<br>
    Roll up! Roll up! the pregnant cry awakes the evening air,<br>
    And angry faces surge like waves around the speakers there.<br>
  &lsquo;What are our sins that we should be an outlawed class?&rsquo; they say,<br>
  &lsquo;Shall we stand by while mates are seized and dragged like &ldquo;lags,&rdquo; away?<br>
  &lsquo;Shall insult be on insult heaped? Shall we let these things go?<br>
    And on a roar of voices comes the diggers&rsquo; answer&mdash;&lsquo;No!&rsquo;<br>
    The day has vanished from the scene, but not the air of night<br>
    Can cool the blood that, ebbing back, leaves brows in anger white.<br>
    Lo! from the roof of Bentley&rsquo;s inn the flames are leaping high;<br>
    They write &lsquo;Revenge!&rsquo; in letters red across the smoke-dimmed
    sky.<br>
    Now the oppressed will drink no more humiliation&rsquo;s cup;<br>
    Call out the troops! Read martial law!&mdash;the diggers&rsquo; blood is
    up!</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>&lsquo;To arms! To arms!&rsquo; the cry is out; &lsquo;To arms if man thou
    art;<br>
  &lsquo;For every pike upon a pole will find a tyrant&rsquo;s heart!&rsquo;<br>
    Now Lalor comes to take the lead, the spirit does not lag,<br>
    And down the rough, wild diggers kneel beneath the Diggers&rsquo; Flag,<br>
    And, rising to their feet, they swear, while rugged hearts beat high,<br>
    To stand beside their leader and to conquer or to die!<br>
    Around Eureka&rsquo;s stockade now the shades of night close fast,<br>
    Three hundred sleep beside their arms, and thirty sleep their last.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>Around about fair Melbourne town the sounds of bells are borne<br>
    That call the citizens to prayer this fateful Sabbath morn;<br>
    But there, upon Eureka&rsquo;s hill, a hundred miles away,<br>
    The diggers&rsquo; forms lie white and still above the blood-stained clay.<br>
    The bells that ring the diggers&rsquo; death might also ring a knell<br>
    For those few gallant soldiers, dead, who did their duty well.<br>
    There&rsquo;s many a &lsquo;someone&rsquo;s&rsquo; heart shall ache, and
    many a someone care,<br>
    For many a &lsquo;someone&rsquo;s darling&rsquo; lies all cold and pallid
    there.<br>
    And now in smoking ruins lie the huts and tents around,<br>
    The diggers&rsquo; gallant flag is down and trampled in the ground.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>The sight of murdered heroes is to hero hearts a goad,<br>
    A thousand men are up in arms upon the Creswick road,<br>
    And wildest rumours in the air are flying up and down,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis said the men of Ballarat will march upon the town.<br>
    But not in vain those diggers died. Their comrades may rejoice,<br>
    For o&rsquo;er the voice of tyranny is heard the people&rsquo;s voice;<br>
    It says: &lsquo;Reform your rotten law, the diggers&rsquo; wrongs make right,<br>
  &lsquo;Or else with them, our brothers now, we&rsquo;ll gather in the fight.&rsquo;<br>
    And now before my vision flash the scenes that followed fast&mdash;<br>
    The trials, and the triumph of the diggers&rsquo; cause at last.<br>
    Twas of such stuff the men were made who saw our nation born,<br>
    And such as Lalor were the men who led their foot-steps on;<br>
    And of such men there&rsquo;ll many be, and of such leaders some,<br>
    In the roll-up of Australians on some dark day yet to come.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLastReview"></a>The Last Review</b></h2>
  <p>Turn&nbsp;the light down, nurse, and leave me, while I hold my last review,<br>
    For the Bush is slipping from me, and the town is going too:<br>
    Draw the blinds, the streets are lighted, and I hear the tramp of feet&mdash;<br>
    And I&rsquo;m weary, very weary, of the&nbsp;Faces in the Street.</p>
  <p>In the dens of Grind and Heartbreak, in the streets of Never-Rest,<br>
    I have lost the scent and colour and the music of the West:<br>
    And I would recall old faces with the memories they bring&mdash;<br>
    Where are Bill and Jim and Mary and the&nbsp;Songs They used to Sing?</p>
  <p>They are coming! They are coming! they are passing through the room<br>
    With the smell of gum leaves burning, and the scent of Wattle bloom!<br>
    And behind them in the timber, after dust and heat and toil,<br>
    Others sit beside the camp fire yarning while the billies boil.</p>
  <p>In the Gap above the ridges there&rsquo;s a flash and there&rsquo;s a glow&mdash;<br>
    Swiftly down the scrub-clad siding come the&nbsp;Lights of Cobb and Co.:<br>
    Red face from the box-seat beaming&mdash;Oh, how plain those faces come!<br>
    From his &lsquo;Golden-Hole&rsquo; &rsquo;tis Peter M&rsquo;Intosh who&rsquo;s
    going home.</p>
  <p>Dusty patch in desolation, bare slab walls and earthen floor,<br>
    And a blinding drought is blazing from horizons to the door:<br>
    Milkless tea and ration sugar, damper junk and pumpkin mash&mdash;<br>
    And a&nbsp;Day on our Selection&nbsp;passes by me in a flash.</p>
  <p>Rush of big wild-eyed store bullocks while the sheep crawl hoplessly,<br>
    And the loaded wool teams rolling, lurching on like ships at sea:<br>
    With his whip across his shoulder (and the wind just now abeam),<br>
    There goes Jimmy Nowlett ploughing through the dust beside his team!</p>
  <p>Sunrise on the diggings! (Oh! what life and hearts and hopes are here)<br>
    From a hundred pointing forges comes a tinkle, tinkle clear&mdash;<br>
    Strings of drays with wash to puddle, clack of countless windlass boles,<br>
    Here and there the red flag flying, flying over golden holes.</p>
  <p>Picturesque, unreal, romantic, chivalrous, and brave and free;<br>
    Clean in living, true in mateship&mdash;reckless generosity.<br>
    Mates are buried here as comrades who on fields of battle fall&mdash;<br>
    And&mdash;the dreams, the aching, hoping lover hearts beneath it all!</p>
  <p>Rough-built theatres and stages where the world&rsquo;s best actors trod&mdash;<br>
    Singers bringing reckless rovers nearer boyhood, home and God;<br>
    Paid in laughter, tears and nuggets in the play that fortune plays&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the palmy days of Gulgong&mdash;Gulgong&nbsp;in the Roaring Days.</p>
  <p>Pass the same old scenes before me&mdash;and again my heart can ache&mdash;<br>
    There the Drover&rsquo;s Wife sits watching (not as Eve did) for a snake.<br>
    And I see the drear deserted goldfields when the night is late,<br>
    And the stony face of Mason watching by his Father&rsquo;s Mate.</p>
  <p>And I see my Haggard Women plainly as they were in life,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the form of Mrs. Spicer and her friend, Joe Wilson&rsquo;s wife,<br>
    Sitting hand in hand &lsquo;Past Carin&rsquo;.&rsquo; not a sigh and not
    a moan,<br>
    Staring steadily before her and the tears just trickle down.</p>
  <p>It was&nbsp;No Place for a Woman&mdash;where the women worked like men&mdash;<br>
    From the Bush and Jones&rsquo; Alley come their haunting forms again.<br>
    And, let this thing be remembered when I&rsquo;ve answered to the roll,<br>
    That I pitied haggard women&mdash;wrote for them with all my soul.</p>
  <p>Narrow bed-room in the City in the hard days that are dead&mdash;<br>
    An alarm clock on the table, and a pale boy on the bed:<br>
    Arvie Aspinalls Alarm Clock&nbsp;with its harsh and startling call<br>
    Never more shall break his slumbers&mdash;<i>I</i>&nbsp;was Arvie Aspinall.</p>
  <p>Maoriland and Steelman,&nbsp;cynic, spieler, stiff-lipped, battler-through<br>
    (Kept a wife and child in comfort, but of course they never knew&mdash;<br>
    Thought he was an honest bagman)&mdash;Well, old man, you needn&rsquo;t hug&mdash;<br>
    Sentimental; you of all men!&mdash;Steelman, Oh! I&nbsp;<i>was</i>&nbsp;a
    mug!</p>
  <p>Ghostly lines of scrub at daybreak&mdash;dusty daybreak in the drought&mdash;<br>
    And a lonely swagman tramping on the track to Further Out:<br>
    Like a shade the form of Mitchell, nose-bag full and bluey up<br>
    And between the swag and shoulders lolls his foolish cattle-pup.</p>
  <p>Kindly cynic, sad comedian! Mitchell! when you&rsquo;ve left the Track,<br>
    And have shed your load of sorrow as we slipped our swags out back,<br>
    We shall have a yarn together in the land of Rest Awhile&mdash;<br>
    And across his ragged shoulder Mitchell smiles his quiet smile.</p>
  <p>Shearing sheds and tracks and shanties&mdash;girls that wait at homestead
    gates&mdash;<br>
    Camps and stern-eyed Union leaders, and&nbsp;Joe Wilson and his Mates<br>
    True and straight, and to my fancy, each one as he passes through<br>
    Deftly down upon the table slips a dusty &lsquo;note&rsquo; or two.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</b></p>
  <p>So at last the end has found me&mdash;(end of all the human push)<br>
    And again in silence round me come my&nbsp;Children of the Bush!&mdash;<br>
    Listen, who are young, and let them&mdash;if I in late and bitter days<br>
    Wrote some reckless lines&mdash;forget them&mdash;there is little there to
    praise.</p>
  <p>I was human, very human, and if in the days misspent<br>
    I have injured man or woman, it was done without intent.<br>
    If at times I blundered blindly&mdash;bitter heart and aching brow&mdash;<br>
    If I wrote a line unkindly&mdash;I am sorry for it now.</p>
  <p>Days in London like a nightmare&mdash;dreams of foreign lands and sea&mdash;<br>
    And Australia is the only land that seemeth real to me.<br>
    Tell the Bushmen to Australia and each other to be true&mdash;<br>
  &lsquo;Tell the boys to stick together!&rsquo; I have held my Last Review.</p>
