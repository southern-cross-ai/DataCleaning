  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheLonelyCrossing"></a>The Lonely Crossing</b></h2>
  <p>A man on foot came down to the river,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent man, on the road alone,<br>
    And dropped his swag with a chill-born shiver,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sat to rest on a wind-worn stone.</p>
  <p>He slid then down to the long grass, bending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His arms above as the resting do,<br>
    And watched a snow-white chariot trending<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its wind-made way o&rsquo;er the wedgewood blue.</p>
  <p>In it sat one of the fairest ladies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That mind could mould, in a crown of white,<br>
    But close beside came a fiend from Hades<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a chariot black as the heart of night.</p>
  <p>The man, he sighed as the fiend would clasp her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then smiled as the wind by a wise decree<br>
    Her white steeds turned to the streets of Jaspar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Satan drave to a sin-black sea.</p>
  <p>The wattles waved, and their sweet reflection<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In crystal fathoms responses made;<br>
    The sunlight silted each soft inflection<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fretted with silver the short&rsquo;ning shade.</p>
  <p>A restless fish made the thin reeds shiver,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A waking wind made the willows moan,<br>
    But the resting man by the noon-bright river<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay dreaming on, in the long grass prone.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>The bell-bird called to its tardy lover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grebe clouds all to the west had sped,<br>
    But the river of death had a soul crossed over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The man with the swag on the bank was dead.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ComingHome"></a>Coming Home</b></h2>
  <p>Going round the back street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the twilight lane,<br>
    While the folk at church meet &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming home again.</p>
  <p>Faded hat and creasy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long since it was new;<br>
    Tent-fly torn and greasy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluey showing through.</p>
  <p>Billy burnt and battered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boots all badly burst,<br>
    Lace and lace-holes shattered,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trousers at their worst.</p>
  <p>Blankets like a riddle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a streak of white<br>
    Down the threadbare middle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When against the light.</p>
  <p>Young face lined and sunburnt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hair just turning grey;<br>
    Many a lesson unlearnt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he went away.</p>
  <p>But he need not bother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s a bite and sup;<br>
    And for all the other &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mother&rsquo;ll fix him up.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="BackAgain"></a>Back Again</b></h2>
  <p>Oh, my boy, come in, do,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are back at last;<br>
    Years since last we saw you &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the time has passed!</p>
  <p>Have a bath and shave first?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No? A cup of tea?<br>
    Think you want a rest worst?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear, oh deary me!</p>
  <p>Look, dear, at your boots, too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All cut with the rocks;<br>
    And you haven&rsquo;t, have you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any mended socks?</p>
  <p>They are always tearing?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw them all away?<br>
    Alberts you are wearing?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodness, what are they?</p>
  <p>Felt that you were coming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I wrote to Bob;<br>
    He says things are humming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;ll get a job.</p>
  <p>Now, dear, don&rsquo;t come near me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re all over dust;<br>
    Can you smoke? Oh, dear me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you really must.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHourIsCome"></a>The Hour Is Come</b></h2>
  <p>How did she fight? She fought well.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did she light? Ah, she fell.<br>
    Why did she fall? God, who knows all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only
  can tell.</p>
  <p>Those she was fighting for &mdash; they<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surely would go to her? Nay!<br>
    What of her pain! Their&rsquo;s is the gain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever
  the way.</p>
  <p>Will they not help her to rise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is death in her eyes?<br>
    Can you not see? She made them free.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What
  if she dies ?</p>
  <p>Can we not help her? Oh, no!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In her good fight it is so<br>
    That all who work never must shirk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suff&rsquo;ring
  and woe.</p>
  <p>But she&rsquo;ll not ever lie down &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her head, in the dust, is a crown<br>
    Jewelled and bright, under whose light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;ll
  rise alone.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AFriendInNeed"></a>A Friend In Need</b></h2>
  <p>Friends will quickly leave you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slight you and deceive you,<br>
    Or will not believe you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
  you have a wrong.</p>
  <p>Those who hurt will hate you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enemies will slate you,<br>
    And as crank disrate you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
  you have a wrong.</p>
  <p>But if you are righted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who coolly slighted<br>
    Will be so delighted!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said
  so all along!</p>
  <p>But you then can show them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you would forego them,<br>
    As too well you know them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since
  you&rsquo;ve had a wrong.</p>
  <p>But your friends, God bless them!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take their hands and press them,<br>
    You&rsquo;ll not have to guess them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
  you&rsquo;ve had a wrong.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Twilight"></a>Twilight</b></h2>
  <p>Though labour may claim and cover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The best of our waking hours,<br>
    Whatever we owe another<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We feel that the dusk is ours.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Tis then that the hard views taken<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of things in the day-glare seen,<br>
    Will soften, and tint, and waken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tone &rsquo;neath a twilight screen.</p>
  <p>While the night-bird softly tenders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet trebles in monotone,<br>
    And the king of day surrenders<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the queen of night his throne &mdash;</p>
  <p>When the earth and the sky are lovers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And present and past are wed,<br>
    And the satisfied soul discovers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How surely God hath led.</p>
  <p>And then as the heart confesses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sins of a selfish way,<br>
    The spirit of pardon blesses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And closes the gates of day.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheHillOfDeath"></a>The Hill Of Death</b></h2>
  <p>No downward path to death we go,<br>
    Through no dark shades or valleys low,<br>
    But up and on, o&rsquo;er rises bright,<br>
    Toward the dawn of endless light.</p>
  <p>For not in lowlands can we see<br>
    The path that was, and that to be;<br>
    But on the height, just where the soul<br>
    Takes deeper breath to reach the goal.</p>
  <p>There we can see the winding way<br>
    That we have journeyed all our day;<br>
    Then turn and view, with spirits still,<br>
    Our future home beyond the hill.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheReformers"></a>The Reformers</b></h2>
  <p>We lead the way, we lead the way,<br>
    We rise alert to meet each day,<br>
    We start the fight, we head the fray,<br>
    We lead the way, we lead the way.</p>
  <p>We turn the sod, we stir the pool,<br>
    We point the way to those who rule.<br>
    We cheek the rogue, we chide the fool,<br>
    We point the way to those who rule.</p>
  <p>We bear reverse, we breast rebuff,<br>
    We force a way o&rsquo;er passes rough,<br>
    We stand the kick, we take the cuff,<br>
    Till Death&rsquo;s stern umpire calls &ldquo;Enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheDiggersDaughter"></a>The Digger&rsquo;s Daughter</b></h2>
  <p>The waratah has stained her cheek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her lips are even brighter;<br>
    Like virgin quartz without a streak<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her teeth are, but far whiter.<br>
    Her eyes are large, and soft, and dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And clear as running water;<br>
    And straight as any stringy bark<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Lil, the digger&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>She&rsquo;ll wash a prospect quick and well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And deftly use the ladle;<br>
    The weight of gold at sight she&rsquo;ll tell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work with tub and cradle.<br>
    She was her father&rsquo;s only mate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And wound up wash and water;<br>
    She worked all day and studied late,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all she knows he taught her.</p>
  <p>She stood alone above the shaft &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A test for woman, rather &mdash;<br>
    When I sprang to the windlass haft<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And helped her land her father.<br>
    She turned her pretty face to me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thank me, and I thought her<br>
    The grandest girl of all her race &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet Lil, the digger&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>And when my luck began to change<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew a trifle bolder<br>
    And told my love, but thought it strange<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew before I told her.<br>
    She said that she would be my wife;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then home I proudly brought her,<br>
    To be my loving mate for life, &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But still the digger&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ALibertine"></a>To A Libertine</b></h2>
  <p>There&rsquo;s blood in the ink of her writing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The paper is stiffened with tears,<br>
    And I with my conscience am fighting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And striving to quiet my fears.</p>
  <p>And these are the words she is saying:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;My life I no longer can bear,<br>
    For death I am constantly praying.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, when will God answer my prayer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>I met her when first the faint dawning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of womanhood tinted her youth,<br>
    She then had no past, like the morning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For she was all candour and truth.</p>
  <p>She knelt at my feet in confession,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And asked me for leading and light;<br>
    To right, where was no retrogression,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cleanse what was spotless and white.</p>
  <p>She held me in deep veneration,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked on me almost as God,<br>
    And gave her sweet life&rsquo;s conservation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of love to the vilest that trod.</p>
  <p>I taught her that love was the duty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And life of the angels of light,<br>
    Then spoiled her sweet spiritual beauty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turned her away from the right.</p>
  <p>I wooed her in delicate fashion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then sullied her soul with my lust;<br>
    I poisoned her life with my passion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And murdered her beautiful trust.</p>
  <p>And now her sweet spirit is flitting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To where other sweet spirits wait,<br>
    While I with soul-lepers am sitting<br>

  <p>I laugh ha, ha! and I laugh ho, ho!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I think it a goodly thing<br>
    To curse the high and to curse the low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to rule both Beggar and King.</p>
  <p>The light will fly from the brightest eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bloom from the fairest cheek;<br>

  <p>I take from its kind the brightest mind<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grim effigy done by Drink.</p>
  <p>I curse the lives of innocent wives<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who could never know ought of me;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the terrible wrongs I see?</p>
  <p>I bleach the hair and I line with care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many faces with thoughts of me;<br>
    And flout the prayer that my hand would spare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pride of the family tree.</p>
  <p>I curse the land, and I curse the sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the poets my praises sing;<br>

  <p>The tar-boy looked perplexed to see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Dawson cut the skin,<br>
    And Sweeper Bill remarked that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had nothing in the bin.</p>
  <p>His eyes for want of sleep were red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slow his shears did click,<br>
    And whispers went around the shed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That Dawson&rsquo;s wife was sick.</p>
  <p>Then kindly spoke old Daddy Tonk:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look so glum, my lad;<br>
    Is she, your missus, very cronk?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, mate,&rdquo; said Tom, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s &mdash; bad.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are there no women on the place ?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be two or three.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;There are, but in my poor wife&rsquo;s case<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say they&rsquo;re &lsquo;all at sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then bring a doctor,&rdquo; Daddy said;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let the woman die!&rdquo;<br>
    But Tommy Dawson hung his head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And made him no reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Get Pile to come out if you can,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll pull the missus through.<br>
    Spend all you have to save her, man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would if I were you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then Dawson looked up from the ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And white his features grew:<br>
  &ldquo;Look, mate! If you had not a pound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now tell me what you&rsquo;d do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What would it cost then, now, to send<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fetch out Dr. Pile?<br>
    Some of the men the cash would lend.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom groaned, &ldquo;A pound a mile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s stiff, by God!&rdquo; said Monty Styles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The doctor does it brown;<br>
    There&rsquo;s sixty-five, I know, good miles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between us and the town.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a &lsquo;coo-ey&rsquo; with her now,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Dawson, in despair.<br>
    I cannot save her anyhow &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m euchred everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then up sprang Maori, on the job &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here, look, see! There&rsquo;s my quid.<br>
    And here, look, see! So help me bob!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s two from Dick and Syd.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And in his hat the money fell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From willing hands and free.<br>
  &ldquo;A quid a mile,&rdquo; said Barney Bell;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Here goes&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll give yer three.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Boss said, &ldquo;Put me down for ten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And catch the blood mare, Ted &mdash;<br>
    And put her in the sulky then &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t wait till she is fed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now, wire the doctor, quick, to come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meet me mile for mile;<br>
    And, Tommy, man, hold up, old chum.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Poor Tommy tried to smile.)</p>
  <p>The squatter lit his pipe with care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drew his chin-strap in,<br>
    Then took his seat and touched the mare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And started for the spin.</p>
  <p>Then slow the hours of night went by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those around the shed,<br>
    For not a man had closed an eye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not one had gone to bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s sinking now,&rdquo; the women said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;She can&rsquo;t much longer last;<br>
    Before an hour she will be dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her strength is failing fast.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and let the sliprails down,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black boy slowly said,<br>
    For far along the road to town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard a horse&rsquo;s tread.</p>
  <p>Then everyone sprang up and bent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A watchful eye and ear,<br>
    And soon the boss a &ldquo;coo-ey&rdquo; sent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show that he was near.</p>
  <p>Then in the middle of the night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood mare, limping, came<br>
    All tucked and blown, and wet and white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And panting hard, but game.</p>
  <p>The doctor quick and silently<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then with the women went,<br>
    And very soon a baby&rsquo;s cry<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was heard in Dawson&rsquo;s tent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;My work is done,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Tommy&rsquo;s hand he pressed;<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve saved your wife and little son,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let Nature do the rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then they went into the shed &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The men and Dr. Pile &mdash;<br>
    And drank his health in Queensland red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And paid him &mdash; pound for mile.</p>

  <p>Sickness, sorrow, death, disgrace,<br>
    All of these I have to face;<br>
    Pain of body, fret of mind,<br>
    Poverty, with bread to find.</p>
  <p>Restless day and sleepless night,<br>
    Dread of darkness, fear of light.<br>
    Not a soul to care for me,<br>
    Not a friend on earth but thee.</p>
  <p>And thou hast a frightened stare<br>
  &rsquo;Neath thine eyelids, unaware.<br>
    And, like Him Who raised the dead,<br>

  <p>I wish now this heart with its pleading refrain<br>
    Would freeze and be still, then this tumult of pain<br>
    That mortals call living would end, and the cast<br>
    Of life be as nought but a pestilence past.</p>
  <p>This robe I am wearing, as white as a cloud,<br>
    With neatly sewn border, would do for a shroud,<br>
    And thus I&rsquo;d be ready, pain-shriven and meet,<br>
    With only to straighten my hands and my feet.</p>
  <p>No sign would I make when Death&rsquo;s hand on me lay,<br>
    No sob would I utter when passing away;<br>
    For those in the house need the rest, all too short,<br>
    To heal the fatigue that a hard day has brought.</p>
  <p>Out on the verandah, asleep on the floor,<br>
    With weary feet blistered, and aching and sore,<br>
    The tramp dreams of home with his head on his swag,<br>
    Nor recks he of drought, or the dry water-bag.</p>
  <p>And soundly asleep, with a sun-blistered face,<br>
    The drover now dreads not the &ldquo;breaks&rdquo; he must chase.<br>
    But he must be up at the first peep of light<br>
    To &ldquo;fetch up&rdquo; the yards for his cattle at night.</p>
  <p>And while all the sheep in the hurdles are snug<br>
    The black boy must rest on his old &rsquo;possum rug.<br>
    In dust and in heat he has shouted all day,<br>
    And sunrise must see him again on his way.</p>
  <p>I looked in the face of Death once, when alone,<br>
    And met the grim King without shudder or moan,<br>
    So I will not shiver nor shriek with affright<br>
    If I have to go with him into the night.</p>
  <p>And then they would take me to where I love best,<br>
    To where I know well that my spirit would rest,<br>
    Where gaudy birds chatter and wild cherries wave,<br>
    And sunset would throw a red haze o&rsquo;er my grave &mdash;</p>
  <p>Away on the gap, &rsquo;neath the big kurrajong<br>
    That stretches its branches the granites among,<br>
    And forms with its shelter a natural tomb<br>
    With rest in its stillness, and peace in its gloom.</p>
  <p>And some one among them, with grief in his breast,<br>
    Might register roughly the place of my rest<br>
    By carving in letters cut deep on its bole<br>
    These plain words: &ldquo;A Woman. May God rest her soul.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In ground that is hallowed let happy folk lie,<br>
    But give me a grave in the bush when I die.<br>
    For have I not lived, loved, and suffered alone?<br>
    Thus making it meet that my grave be unknown.</p>

  <h3 align="center"><b>Dream I</b></h3>
  <p>Just as the starving cattle come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To drink at fall of night,<br>
    They came to me with falt&rsquo;ring steps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And faces wan and white.</p>
  <p>And they were there at dawn of day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With streaming hair and eyes;<br>
    And piteous looks that seemed to say:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Help! help! ere all good dies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I lifted up my bleeding feet.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the red drops fall,<br>
    I raised the oaken yoke and showed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The big hot spots of gall.</p>
  <p>I said: &ldquo;I am myself a slave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bound by a man-made law.<br>
    I weep a fate that cannot save,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So plead with me no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They cried, &ldquo;Oh, sister! Hide your feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And let the hard yoke fall,<br>
    You tread the wine press all alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you are strong withal.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go to the rulers we have borne,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plead for the babes we bear,<br>
    Sue till the dusk from early morn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray till they needs MUST care.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go, while we watch, and weep, and wait,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave home, and love, and all,<br>
    But when you reach the outer gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call as the cattle call.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I yielded then, and sought alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A city near the main;<br>
    Where prejudice, on iron throne,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held universal reign.</p>
  <p>And oft I gave the conflict o&rsquo;er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fell, beset by pain<br>
    And cruel wrong and losses sore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then rose and fought again.</p>
  <p>Until one fatal day I fell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Methought to rise no more,<br>
    And years went by ere I was well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then not as before.</p>
  <p>A cripple in life&rsquo;s afternoon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside a dead, cold hearth.<br>
    With no glad joybell&rsquo;s lingering croon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or hope&rsquo;s bright aftermath.</p>
  <p>I listened to the leaden rain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drone through the dismal dusk;<br>
    And mourned my dreams of golden grain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mead of rue and rusk.</p>
  <p>I said: &ldquo;Oh, heart with sorrow sore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wait we, you and I?<br>
    The day is lost, and hope is o&rsquo;er,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not &lsquo;curse God and die?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then hark! a quick step nears my door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A woman&rsquo;s form I see,<br>
    She comes across my humble floor<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looks with joy on me.</p>
  <p>She gladly says: &ldquo;I come to thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this thrice-blessed day<br>
    To tell thee, sister, we are free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To kneel with thee and pray.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I quickly sank upon my knees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And looked the thanks I thought,<br>
    That He who e&rsquo;en a sparrow sees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had watched us as we fought.</p>
  <p>Then as I rose and dried my tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It surely did meseem<br>
    That they had helped me with their prayers &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The women of my dream.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h3 align="center"><b>Dream II</b></h3>
  <p>And now I see their forms again<br>
    All changed from those of yore,<br>
    Not like the slaves who sued in vain<br>
    For freedom, as before.</p>
  <p>Ah, not in sackcloth sit they now<br>
    With ashes on each head,<br>
    For freedom&rsquo;s crown adorns each brow &mdash;<br>
    Their dress is Royal Red.</p>
  <p>Their yokes are carved to standards light<br>
    Held in each firm right hand,<br>
    And floating free are letters bright:<br>
  &ldquo;For God and Native Land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And hopefully they speak and move,<br>
    And sing as on they go;<br>
    For they will save the land they love<br>
    From sin, and want, and woe.</p>

  <p>Last night as I lay on my bed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dreamed a strange, sad dream.<br>
    The pathway that I travelled led<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along a sunlit stream</p>
  <p>That mirrored, as it swept along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oaks that o&rsquo;er it bent;<br>
    And with their weird, tuneless song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its own sweet cadence blent.</p>
  <p>All things were bathed in golden light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers from many a nook<br>
    Bent down to kiss their faces bright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflected in the brook.</p>
  <p>A wondrous wealth of dark blue sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seemed fallen at my feet,<br>
    And o&rsquo;er its surface silently<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There sailed a snowy fleet</p>
  <p>Of fleecy clouds that gliding went<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward a bank beyond<br>
    A velvet sward, all thickly sprent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With star-like flower and frond.</p>
  <p>Reclining there I saw a form<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had not seen for years;<br>
    And o&rsquo;er me passed a sudden storm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of mingled hopes and fears.</p>
  <p>He quickly rose and came to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, &ldquo;Shall we be friends?<br>
    And oh, believe, the change in thee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My heart with sorrow rends!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I answered, &ldquo;Why dost thou desire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open wounds half healed,<br>
    And fan to flame a dying fire<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in my sad heart sealed?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sad heart,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;no longer sad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have found a balm<br>
    For every sorrow that I had,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For every storm a calm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I gave thee honour, due by right<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unto a jealous God,<br>
    And in thy causeless, sudden flight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kissed His chastening rod.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hast thou not blasted on my way<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne&rsquo;er held by another than thee.<br>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Justasthegreydawningganfaintlytobeam"></a>A Dream</b></h2>
  <p>Just as the grey dawning &rsquo;gan faintly to beam<br>
    One still summer&rsquo;s morning I dreamt a fair dream.<br>
    I thought that my body was tenantless clay,<br>
    And friends were preparing to lay it away,<br>
    They stood at my bedside, one weeping aloud,<br>
    While two with deft fingers placed on me a shroud.<br>
    And one who had loved me and knew all my care<br>
    Placed flowers about me and braided my hair,<br>
    And murmured, &ldquo;Poor creature, her troubles are o&rsquo;er,<br>
    And they who have vexed her can vex her no more.&rdquo;<br>
    Then tenderly crossing my hands on my breast<br>
    She kissed me and blessed me and left me to rest.<br>
    The kindest words only about me were said<br>
    And restfully thought I, &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis well to be dead.&rdquo;<br>
    I sighed with contentment, so safe did I seem &mdash;<br>
    Alas, for the sigh! for it banished my dream.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCityBird"></a>The City Bird</b></h2>
  <p>A city bird once in a desperate rage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threw over the bars of his screen<br>
    The whole of the seed that was put in his cage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it grew to a miniature green.</p>
  <p>Sometimes when my troubles come up in a mass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And fate a new sorrow doth send,<br>
    I turn my wet eyes to that bright bit of grass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I would to the face of a friend.</p>
  <p>For often it helps me to face a new day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Sydney at worst must be seen,<br>
    To look on the sparkling dew as it lay<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the blades of the city-yard green.</p>
  <p>Returning again at the end of the day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I sit myself wearily down,<br>
    The scent of the grass takes me ever away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fret of a dust-covered town.</p>
  <p>I wish when they lay me away to my rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bosom and brain are serene,<br>
    Some friend would remember to plant o&rsquo;er my breast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tuft of that city-yard green.</p>

  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Thewhiteconvolvulus"></a>In Memoriam</b></h2>
  <p>The white convolvulus, fair tenuous flower,<br>
    Opes its pure petals at day&rsquo;s tenderest hour.<br>
    And all who gaze into its virgin face<br>
    Know God is good, and take fresh heart of grace:<br>
    At morn a joy, at eve a memory sweet,<br>
    For it is smitten by the noontide heat;<br>
    How fair, how frail, how fated, and &mdash; ah me!<br>
    How true an emblem, dear dead girl, of thee.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="AGrave"></a>A Grave</b></h2>
  <p>In a quiet country churchyard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lilies grow tall and white,<br>
    And vie with the moist red roses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In tempting the bees to light:</p>
  <p>Where the big ripe briar berry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red bead-like and bright and gay,<br>
    Allures, with the native cherry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bright little birds to stay:</p>
  <p>Where butterflies black as aces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Detour from their dainty cones,<br>
    To beauty spot sculptured faces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And blot the white marble stones:</p>
  <p>There is in the path you enter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ideal burial plot &mdash;<br>
    Half way betwixt gate and centre, &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One badly neglected spot.</p>
  <p>A large heap covers the holding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spreads itself out all around;<br>
    As if in its girth enfolding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some treasure beneath the ground.</p>
  <p>No cross does it own, nor coping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No verdure, nor even shade;<br>
    But solid it is, and sloping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shield-like and undecayed.</p>
  <p>Time does not appear to lessen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This heap of unsightly stones,<br>
    Nor does it depend or rest on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its keeping of nameless bones.</p>
  <p>Who is he, I thought, that spurneth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The efforts of time to blight?<br>
    Who is it that mutely turneth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All steps to the left and right?</p>
  <p>I asked for the chart and read on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its pages yellow and stiff:<br>
  &ldquo;A Hermit, unknown, found dead on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rocks at the foot of the cliff.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of life&rsquo;s uncertain way.</p>
  <p>Thou&rsquo;rt resting here in perfect peace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind Heaven favoured thee,<br>
    In that it willed thee quick release<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all the cares that be.</p>
  <p>But thou wert ne&rsquo;er a child of earth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ne&rsquo;er like the noisy crowd<br>
    Who clustered round our father&rsquo;s hearth &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy voice was never loud.</p>
  <p>And sometimes when the moon at night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shines through the open door,<br>
    And casts a belt of silver light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across our humble floor &mdash;</p>
  <p>I fancy then, my sister dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That back to earth and me<br>
    Thy spirit floats; I feel thee near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though thee I cannot see.</p>
  <p>I stretch vain arms that would enfold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee in a fond embrace,<br>
    Forgetting long, long, years have rolled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I beheld thy face.</p>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas well thou could&rsquo;st not long remain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where care would be thy lot,<br>
    Nor would I have thee back again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God knows, dear, I would not.</p>
  <p>In vain in thought I backward stray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And search from year to year<br>
    To record find of e&rsquo;en a day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unclouded by a care.</p>
  <p>Joy never twined a wreath for me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May-day&rsquo;s sunniest hours,<br>
    But sorrow&rsquo;s tares were safe to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inwoven with the flowers.</p>
  <p>It hovers o&rsquo;er me through the night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And robs me of my rest,<br>
    Nor flies when morning sunbeams light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dew on nature&rsquo;s breast.</p>
  <p>But storms may beat about thy grave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rage above thy head;<br>
    It frets thee not how winds may rave &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe in thy silent bed.</p>
  <p>And I could oft without regret<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resign each cherished scheme<br>
    And rest with thee, so care beset<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And weary do I seem.</p>
  <p>But not while shines an harvest sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must slumber come to me,<br>
    At eve, with full day&rsquo;s labour done<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweeter the rest will be.</p>

  <p>I linger late alone to-night while all the household sleep,<br>
    And sadly o&rsquo;er the changeful past does memory backward sweep &mdash;<br>
    Recalling happy girlhood days that did too swiftly glide,<br>
    And ever &rsquo;midst their brightest scenes I find thee at my side.<br>
    Again in the secluded stream we gambol merrily;<br>
    Again we climb the mountain spur where sober she-oaks sigh,<br>
    To cull a wealth of wattle bloom, and seek the purple vine<br>
    That round the rugged ironbarks in velvet circles twine.<br>
    And stay we oft to trace o&rsquo;erhead the screeching cockatoo<br>
    Or, wond&rsquo;ring, watch the bounding pace of the startled kangaroo.<br>
    And, all unheeding flight of time, do farther hillward roam<br>
    Until the slanting shadows point toward our distant home.<br>
    Then hand in hand, with voices blent a school-learnt song we sing<br>
    Or make the silent mountain gorge with laughing echoes ring;<br>
    Thy cheerful, ever-hoping way had e&rsquo;er a charm for me,<br>
    And if, like mortal, thou had faults, I cared not them to see.<br>
    What it did suit thy will to do did ever mine behove<br>
    I hated what &rsquo;twas thine to hate, and loved what thou didst love;<br>
    And when I think that girlish form, with graces never told,<br>
    Lay out to-night &rsquo;neath wind and rain in Rookwood&rsquo;s greedy fold,<br>
    A storm of such deep grief and pain does surging o&rsquo;er me roll<br>
    That e&rsquo;en I bless the tears that now relieve my troubled soul.<br>
    But some will doubtless say such love &rsquo;twixt women could not be<br>
    So thou art safe, their unbelief will not discomfort me.<br>
    I try to think our Father&rsquo;s will in taking thee is best,<br>
    For after all an early grave, dear girl, is early rest.<br>
    And if it be, as I suppose, that after Heavenly birth<br>
    The spirit freed may share the thoughts of those still bound to earth,<br>
    Endowed with higher power to see the workings of each breast,<br>
    Then fondly thou&rsquo;lt enrol me with the few who loved thee best.</p>

    You say that you prayed, when she lingered in pain,<br>
    That God in His mercy would take her again.<br>
    He heeded your prayer, and a beautiful sleep<br>
    Stole over our darling; then why do you weep?<br>
    You tell how the angels sang paeans of love<br>
    To welcome her home to the mansions above,<br>
    Where lovingly over her spirit they keep<br>
    A bright watch forever; then why do you weep?<br>
    And have you not told us again and again<br>
    That we will yet see her set free from all pain,<br>
    Beyond the bright sun where no dark shadows creep?<br>

    Altho&rsquo; she is safe, and for ever at rest,<br>
    A yearning to see her will rise in my breast.<br>
    I pray and endeavour to quell it in vain,<br>
    But stronger it comes and yet stronger again,<br>
    Till all the bright thoughts of her happier lot<br>

    And while I thus yearn so intensely to see<br>
    This child that the angels are keeping for me,<br>
    I doubt for the time where her spirit has flown &mdash;<br>
    If the love e&rsquo;en of angels can fully atone<br>
    For the loss of a mother&rsquo;s, mysterious and deep.<br>

    What can it avail that beneath this sod<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My child lies deaf to my calling?&rdquo;</p>

  <p>But again he is on his midnight round,<br>
    And his words to me have a soothing sound;<br>

  <p>And have taught me what it was hard to know,<br>
