  <h2 align="center"><font size="+4"><b><a name="HenryLawsonBelongstoUs"></a>Henry Lawson Belongs to Us </b></font></h2>
  <p><b>We belong to him and to his traditions</b></p>
  <p>During the wild, turbulent decades of the last century, when the great questions
    were being decided&mdash;whether Australian Trade Unionism was to survive
    the attacks of employers and reactionary Governments, whether an independent
    political Labor Party was to be formed, whether the people were to build
    their strongholds before the trusts massed for the death-blow&mdash;Henry
    Lawson inspired the Australian masses with his poetry, wrote for Labor Journals,
    talked with Labor leaders, infiltrated our country with his creed of mateship.</p>
  <p>Henry Lawson belongs to the people, not to the money-bags; to the masses,
    not to the monopolists; to the shearers, not to the squatters; to rouseabouts,
    not to the overseas investor; to the spirit of Eureka.</p>
  <p>Lawson was the people&rsquo;s poet, not merely because he sympathised with
    the people, but because he supported Unions with them, agitated and organised
    during the crisis of the last century.</p>
  <p>When Lawson was born in 1867, women were breaking stones to earn money to
    support their families; men were tramping for work; the Benevolent Society
    was caring for 5880 families; a city night refuge and a soup kitchen had
    been opened.&nbsp; Immigration continued and unemployment increased.</p>
  <p>Mass meeting of unemployed demanded work&mdash;their protests against starving
    in city or country were the significant cries heard at the birth of a man
    who was to hear the echo of these cries throughout his life.</p>
  <p>So the direction of Lawson&rsquo;s experience was set. Amid all the temptations
    of fame, and the disillusionment of mistakes, Lawson never deserted the people.</p>
  <p>He linked the hardship of the small farmer to the sufferings of the city
    unemployed. He walked this continent. Before one clerk, shearer, railway
    worker or miner had been brought into a Labor League, Lawson had brought
    them into volumes of poetry, made them see their unity, pressed them within
    the covers of his understanding into a mass force. He sowed the seeds of
    inspiration in the hearts of many of the Labor pioneers of 1890.</p>
  <p>Against poverty, inequality, snobbery and injustice, Lawson railed with
    all the vigor and hopes of the &rsquo;nineties.</p>
  <p>There is a melancholy strain in Lawson&rsquo;s work. It comes both from
    the sadness of the Australian Bush and from his own feeling of frustration
    that the people were not responding rapidly enough to the demands of the
    moment. There is a note of despair mixed with anger as he records the &ldquo;sallow,
    sunken faces that are drifting through the street.&rdquo; There is also sustained
    loyalty&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m too old to rat!&rdquo;&mdash;and a rebellious
    faith that the day would dawn when the workers would assume their rightful
    place as the rulers of State and industry.</p>
  <p>It is because his genius was able to fan the embers that blazed into the
    undying fire of the Australian Labor Movement. . . . .</p>

  <p>To hand through time, through future years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remembrance down to men,<br>
    Who shall in bronze, with magic art,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make Lawson live again?<br>
    Who does so, must remember him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who trudged lone ways,<br>
    Lone ways and dry, with weary feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through hot and dusty days.</p>
  <p>Who does so must an image carve,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of one who did his best,<br>
    His vivid best, to sing and tell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Story of the West,<br>
    And something there of pity, too,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who carves his image must,<br>
    Contrive to hint of tears for folk<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast down and in the dust.</p>
  <p>Who carves his statue must reveal<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What all Australia knows,<br>
    And all Australia hails him for,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, in his song and prose,<br>
    For love of kind he did his best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For justice ever stood,<br>
    And dipped his pen into his heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To write of Brothergood.</p>

  <p align="center">* * * * *  </p>
  <p>I wonder would the apathy of wealthy men endure<br>
    Were all their windows level with the faces of the poor?<br>
    Ah! Mammon&rsquo;s slaves, your knees shall knock, your hearts in terror
    beat,<br>
    When God demands a reason for the sorrows of the street;<br>
    The wrong things and the bad things<br>
    And the sad things that we meet<br>
    In the filthy lane and alley, and the cruel, heartless street.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * </p>
  <p>But the curse of class distinction from our shoulders shall be hurled<br>
    An&rsquo; the sense of Human Kinship revolutionise the world</p>
  <p>Then we all will meet amidships on this stout old earthly craft,<br>
    An&rsquo; there won&rsquo;t be any friction &rsquo;twixt the classes fore-&rsquo;n
    aft.<br>
    We&rsquo;ll be brothers, fore-&rsquo;n aft!<br>
    Yes, an&rsquo; sisters, fore-&rsquo;n aft!<br>
    When the people work together, and there ain&rsquo;t no fore-&rsquo;n aft.</p>

    Its Purpose and Programme</b></h2>
  <p>The Henry Lawson Labor College has been created by the Australian Labor
    Party in New South Wales to fill a need; the need to produce more men and
    women trained to take their places as skilled fighters in the cause of achieving
    the Objective and Platform of the Party.</p>
  <p>Therefore, without overlooking the value of purely educational and cultural
    subjects, the College will place emphasis on an understanding of the way
    the economic system works; of the nature of government; of how public opinion
    is influenced; of the growth and administration of Trades Unionism and of
    the A.L.P. itself; and, above all, how to alter governmental and economic
    institutions to provide a better way of life for the Australian people.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Methodsand1945Programme"></a>Methods and 1945 Programme</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp; As soon as possible, the college will have it&rsquo;s own building,
    with its own class and lecture rooms, club and recreation facilities, library
    and bookshop.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile time marches, and we cannot wait. So in this, its first year,
    the college will conduct in the evenings at the Trades Hall, Goulburn Street:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Commencing Monday, February 19, four Popular Series of Lectures, each
      Series consisting of six lectures, details of which may be found overleaf.</li>
    <li>Tutorial Clases of a more formal and intensive character, starting on
      Wednesday, April 4, covering the following subjects:&nbsp; </li>
    <ol>

            <li>English, Journalism and Public Speaking.</li>
            <li>A.L.P and Trade Union History and Organisation; and Arbitration
              Court procedure.</li>
            <li>Australian Government (History, Structure, Methods).</li>
            <li>Elementary Economics.</li>
            <li>Theory and Practice of Socialism.</li>

    </ol>
  </ol>
  <p>Those who wish to make sure of being enrolled for one or more of these subjects
    should contact the A.L.P. Office, Trades Hall, Goulburn Street (MA3848),
    without delay. Those who wish to attend any one or more of the Series of
    Popular Lectures commencing Monday, February 19, should also contact the
    A.L.P. Office, and make sure of a seat by obtaining a Course Card, entitling
    them to attendance at all six lectures in any one Series. Course Cards are

  <p class="note">Closing date of applications for Foundation Membership of the College has
    been extended. Application forms may be obtained from Mr. J. Stewart, Secretary,
