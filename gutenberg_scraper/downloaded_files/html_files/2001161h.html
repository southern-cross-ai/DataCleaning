  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</b></h2>
  <p class="note">This little work is a collection of verses composed in leisure
    moments, many of them when at home on a western farm as I waited at night
    for the horses to finish feeding before turning them through the sliprails
    after a day at the plough. Some were composed by the camp fire, where I often
    sat alone watching the dying embers of boxwood when no sound broke the stillness
    of the night save, perhaps, the tinkle of a horse bell, or the distant cry
    of a curlew. Others were written in town and some in New Zealand.</p>
  <p class="note">I shall feel gratified if their perusal gives my old mates any pleasure.</p>
  <p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William
    Dean</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheWheatIsIn"></a>The Wheat Is In</b></h2>
  <p>The ploughs are propped by the farmyard fence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rust with the harrow tines,<br>
    The horses graze where the grass is best,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Untouched by the long plough lines.<br>
    Their shoulders heal with the rest, and hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will grow on the scars again,<br>
    The hames and collars are hung aside,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With many a work-worn chain.<br>
    The empty bags over the beams hang,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seed that was left stands by,<br>
    And no team halts at the head land fence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No ploughman the lines untie.</p>
  <p>No bell is heard, or the heavy thud<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of hoofs ere the break of day,<br>
    No ploughman&rsquo;s voice at the stable door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seldom a horse&rsquo;s neigh,<br>
    Men breakfast not by a candle light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rush with an eager haste,<br>
    To get to work ere the stars are gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No hour of the day to waste,<br>
    For with the seed in the drill at dawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though horses and man seemed thin,<br>
    The fanner vowed there would be no rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By day till the wheat was in!</p>
  <p>And now the rain on the roof above<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May fall, with a merry din,<br>
    The farmer sleeps through the winter nights<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Content that the wheat is in.<br>
    Or while the moon lights the frosty air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dreams of the hard blue-stone,<br>
    And talks aloud of the undressed wheat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For fields that he thinks unsown,<br>
    And jumps from bed as the clock strikes four<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To dress and the work begin,<br>
    But dozes off with the pleasant thought,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wheat&mdash;ah, the wheat is in!</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ThePostMiss"></a>The Post Miss</b></h2>
  <p>Across the rise where the wattles grow,<br>
    I often ride when the sun is low,<br>
    Along the rack where the cattle camp,<br>
    To get my mail &mdash; or a postage stamp.<br>
    To stay and chat for awhile with Kate,<br>
    Beneath the stars at the garden gate,<br>
    To whisper love, and my hope renew<br>
    By saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve letters overdue!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I take a paper, and every week<br>
    To Dingo Gully or Stoney Creek<br>
    I always write, for I never fail<br>
    To swell the bulk of the outward mail,<br>
    The mail is small, as you might suppose,<br>
    Some one must write or the post might close,<br>
    But still I get, do you understand,<br>
    No note addressed in a lady&rsquo;s hand!</p>
  <p>All iron will, and a strong right arm,<br>
    Will change my land to a fertile farm,<br>
    And this old life I will cast aside,<br>
    By making Kate at the post my bride.<br>
    And still some use of the post I&rsquo;ll make,<br>
    To send away for the wedding cake,<br>
    And then not worry so much (would you?)<br>
    For letters or papers overdue! </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheStationPet"></a>The Station Pet</b></h2>
  <p>Her father was leaving the station,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through some little thing he had done;<br>
    And turned from a brief altercation,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bid us good-bye on the run.<br>
    With frost laying white on the fences,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ice an inch thick on the dam,<br>
    That morning to cut down expenses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told Nell to part with her lamb.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We travel by train&mdash;cannot truck it,&rdquo;<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And oh! how the little one cried,<br>
  How often it drank from her bucket&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas her&rsquo;s when the mother had died.<br>
  I stood with my mate, Jack Mc&rsquo;Kibbou,<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sunday before and watched Nell,<br>
  Who playfully decked it with ribbon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adorning it&rsquo;s neck with a bell.</p>
  <p>She fed it the last time, and weeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said with her hand on the gate:<br>
  &ldquo;The lamb, Tom&mdash;I&rsquo;ll leave in your keeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll leave it to you and your mate.&rdquo;<br>
    And Nellie has gone, and when older,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When clover and grass spring again,<br>
    I fear that the lamb, growing bolder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will join the big flock on the plain.</p>
  <p>I trust, when from creek side and clearing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We muster for those in their &ldquo;stands,&rdquo;<br>
    That one of the flock at the shearing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Won&rsquo;t pass to a rough shearer&rsquo;s hands<br>
    To cut and to mangle to pieces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after for others to cram<br>
    Unknown with the other small fleeces,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fleece of that little girl&rsquo;s lamb.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="DeadDogPinch"></a>&ldquo;Dead Dog Pinch&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&rsquo;Twas simple how it got the name&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Brown, a shearing drummer,<br>
    On horseback with a rifle came<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along, in early summer.<br>
    A dog rushed out of Turner&rsquo;s hut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Tom, his bark to stifle<br>
    He turned and aimed with eyes half shut,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And downed him with his rifle.</p>
  <p>Old Turner caught him in the act<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And cried, &ldquo;A pound to square it!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;I shot the mongrel that&rsquo;s a fact,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pound, how can I spare it?<br>
  &rsquo;Twill pinch the youngsters much I fear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(To you it seems a trifle),<br>
    The missus gets no dress this year&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The devil take the rifle!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He paid it ere he moved an inch<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Don&rsquo;t everybody know it,)<br>
    The place is known as &ldquo;Dead Dog Pinch&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A dead dog lies below it).<br>
    And should it ever be a town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The name was through a trifle&mdash;<br>
    A careless word by Thomas Brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bullet from a rifle. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ProfessorStan"></a>&ldquo;Professor&rdquo;  Stan</b></h2>
  <p>If once you strike our boarding house<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll know him by his hair,<br>
    It&rsquo;s nearly seven inches long&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Like all the artists wear,&rdquo;<br>
    A kind of Barnum hard to beat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very cunning &ldquo;kid,&rdquo;<br>
    A fellow who accomplishes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What few men ever did,<br>
    He&rsquo;s short, and straight, and shaven clean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A funny little man&mdash;<br>
    One of a type you rarely meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is our &ldquo;Professor&rdquo; Stan.</p>
  <p>And Stanley shows us tricks at times<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pennies up his sleeve,<br>
    Then &rsquo;kerchiefs vanish from his palm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And billiard balls deceive.<br>
    He spins a plate above his head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you still insist<br>
    He takes a doll in either hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And turns ventriloquist.<br>
    He speaks of jugglers, long since dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how the breeding ran,<br>
    And he was quite a marvel &mdash; was<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The great grand dad of Stan?</p>
  <p>Now, Stanley in his cunning way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t give away his wit,<br>
    The men who meet him every day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have never dreamed of it.<br>
    But in the brain, beneath that hair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is much that&rsquo;s come to stay.<br>
    The time will come, he told me once,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The time when it will pay,<br>
    And he will take the people&rsquo;s cash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As not another can,<br>
    And all this arid Commonwealth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will know the worth of Stan!</p>
  <p>He hasn&rsquo;t faced the public yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it to the test,<br>
    But I, yes, I&rsquo;m the chosen one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will take him somewhere West,<br>
    To see the bush land after rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And goodness only knows,<br>
    A small marquee, with gaudy sides,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all the country shows.<br>
    At Dubbo, Bourke, and right away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Coonabarabran<br>
    Will people pay to hear the wit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And see the tricks of Stan!</p>
  <p>And should you read in papers soon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a risky trip,<br>
    Where masked men wait for one with cash,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With tire arms on each hip,<br>
    Remember, that across the plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By humpy, creek, and rut,<br>
    I go with one who looks as if<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hair was never cut.<br>
    So should you get descriptions of<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dusty caravan,<br>
    And of a man whose locks are long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll know I&rsquo;m out with Stan! </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="WhatsInAName"></a>What&rsquo;s In A Name?</b></h2>
  <p class="note">In 1902, the residents of Bocobble petitioned the authorities, and succeeded
    in getting the original and aboriginal name of that place changed to &ldquo;Pinecliff.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No longer startled brumbies will,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The piney brambles break,<br>
    Or Dingoes howl at dead of night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep a man awake.<br>
    The squatter&rsquo;s day has gone for aye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With wether, ewe, and lamb,<br>
    Dalgetty&rsquo;s station had it once&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The block, reserve, and dam,<br>
    All hugged by unselected land,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is it not a shame?<br>
    To kick the black man when he&rsquo;s down&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the native name.</p>
  <p>For well do I remember how,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With bush land everywhere,<br>
    We tightened girths and mounted in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A morning fresh and fair,<br>
    And brought the brumbies Gapward, aye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laughed, long after dark,<br>
    About the bucks in Finch&rsquo;s horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day at Noah&rsquo;s ark,<br>
    We &ldquo;took&rdquo; M&rsquo;c Nevin&rsquo;s fences, and:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some years did our best<br>
    To hold our own as riders &rsquo;gainst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The riders of the west,</p>
  <p>We saw the lather rising to<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wildest horses flanks,<br>
    And scared the kangaroos that bogged,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In slowly drying tanks,<br>
    But farms, and miles of clearing, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t seem the same&mdash;<br>
    Fresh blood, and someone then proposed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the native name.<br>
    In time, a school, and railway, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, at last it came&mdash;<br>
    The place is known as Pinecliff, they<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have changed the native name.</p>
  <p>The black man&rsquo;s grave is yonder, by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lofty yellow box,<br>
    A murdered aboriginal,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the days of Cox,<br>
    And here and there, by many trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the droughty west,<br>
  &rsquo;Neath little mounds, by native marks<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do black men lay at rest<br>
    And as the dingoes in the scrub,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For sheep-yard cease to sniff<br>
  &ldquo;Bocobble&rdquo; gap, reserve, and dam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The white man names &ldquo;Pinecliff'&rdquo;.</p>
  <p>Australia federated! what,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nation by and bye,<br>
    When &rsquo;possums cease to chatter, where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The startled curlews cry.<br>
    The black men die, the old hands go<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new man comes along,<br>
    Who knew not black: or pioneer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;puts to right&rdquo; the &ldquo;wrong.<br>
  &ldquo;Pinecliff&rdquo; is harsh in euphony,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And who have we to blame,<br>
    Ah, some one lately did it, dared<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To change the native name. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheOcean"></a>The Ocean</b></h2>
  <p>I stand by the heaving ocean,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And look o&rsquo;er the waves afar &mdash;<br>
    And watch the wide water&rsquo;s motion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away where the great ships are.<br>
    I gaze on the scene, and ponder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis blue as a summer sky;<br>
    But off in the distance yonder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark waves are mountains high.</p>
  <p>A change from the bush, a drover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just fresh from the bridle reins,<br>
    With the long miles ridden over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Away on the sandy plains;<br>
    A change from the horses tripping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In grass to the settler&rsquo;s door,<br>
    To look at the sea-foam dripping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From rocks where the breakers roar. </p>
  <p>A scene for a bushman splendid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think of when from the tanks,<br>
    Each overflow stream has wended<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its course to the river banks,<br>

  <p>Some bushmen rode one Summer day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a fiery sun<br>
    Through forest land some miles away<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From old M&rsquo;Ivor&rsquo;s run.</p>
  <p>All but the boy (who ventured there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M&rsquo;Donald close beside)<br>
    Tall, bearded men and bushmen were,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And well they all could ride.</p>
  <p>Young Bell had begged that morn that he<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Might go and join the chase,<br>
    That o&rsquo;er the waste land he might see<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Them test a wild mob&rsquo;s pace.</p>
  <p>Reluctantly they gave consent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just to test his pace,<br>
    And please the boy, M&rsquo;Donald lent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A horse that &ldquo;once could race.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>Then over gully, plain, and hill<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They rode, nor sought the shade<br>
    Although the sun grew hotter still &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their paces were not stayed.</p>
  <p>For out across some level land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brumbies they espied,<br>
    Then old M&rsquo;Donald made a stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told them how to ride.</p>
  <p>And soon they knew a stallion&rsquo;s stride&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black horse, &ldquo;Forest King,&rdquo;<br>
    That many bushmen far and wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had failed to catch and bring.</p>
  <p>And fearlessly they turned and rode<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As old M&rsquo;Donald planned,<br>
    But heat and pace too quickly showed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defeat on every hand.</p>
  <p>Defeat to all, save one alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boy who cleared the heath<br>
    To higher ground, where granite stone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went crashing down beneath.</p>
  <p>For Mac drew rein ere long, and cried:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go, Harry Bell&mdash;go on &mdash;<br>
    Your weight is light, and you can ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep them in sight&mdash;we&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>To  &ldquo;One Tree Hill&rdquo; the eager men<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then climbed to view the chase,<br>
    And saw the brumbies wheel again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slowly homeward pace.</p>
  <p>And soon they saw within a mile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward the stockyard wing,<br>
    The stripling in crack drover style,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close up on &ldquo;Forest King.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>He brought him down the track for home,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by the willowed tank&mdash;<br>
    His panting horse, with flakes of foam<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From bridle bit to flank. </p>
  <p>But he had made the pace too hard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too fast for one grass fed &mdash;<br>
    The brumby fell when near the yard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sulked, and soon lay dead.</p>
  <p>The run was o&rsquo;er, and with remorse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not many words spake they,<br>
    As each upon a knocked-out horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursued his homeward way.</p>
  <p>That day is past, but on a run,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Lachlan river&rsquo;s side,<br>

  <p>A letter came to Coady&rsquo;s, and he found it on the floor<br>
    On coming from the races, where he&rsquo;d spent a week or more.<br>
    And early in the morning, as he saddled up his mare,<br>
    He placed the letter in his hat above his unkempt hair.<br>
    And through the stony ridges, on by gully, gorge, and gap<br>
    He travelled in the broiling sun away to Charlie Tapp.<br>
    For years they knew each other, and this Tapp could write and read;<br>
    And when it came to business he was Coady&rsquo;s friend indeed.<br>
    And twenty miles was &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;&mdash;there and back was half
    a day;<br>
    And rarely, very rarely, Charlie Tapp would be away.<br>
    When Coady shook the letter from his hat at nine o&rsquo;clock<br>
    His neighbour merely turned and said, &ldquo;a form about your stock.<br>
    So come inside, old fellow, have a feed now, and a smoke,<br>
    You&rsquo;ll stay until to-morrow&mdash;take the saddle off your moke.&rdquo;<br>
    But Coady said, &ldquo;I cannot stay, &rsquo;twas waiting there for me<br>
    On coming from the races, and the coach will leave at three.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis all about your stock,&rdquo; said Tapp&mdash;&ldquo;the number
  and the breed.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Why, hang it all,&rdquo; said Coady, &ldquo;don't I wish that I could
  read.&rdquo;<br>
    And Tapp, with pen, and bottle of adulterated ink.<br>
    Sat down while neighbour Coady scratched his head, and tried to think.<br>
    He gave the nearest &ldquo;post town,&rdquo; and the acres in his land,<br>
    He named his &ldquo;run,&rsquo;&rsquo;and then he gave the letters of his
    brand.<br>
  &ldquo;A horse and pig is all I have, I&rsquo;m overseer, and boss.<br>
    And when you write my signature just say you want my &lsquo;cross,&rsquo; &rdquo;<br>
    And Coady since has married, and his children will be wise,<br>
    They get a bit o&rsquo; learning at the school across the rise;<br>
    And often does their father tell how once, in weather warm,<br>
    He travelled twenty miles for Tapp to fill a blessed form.<br>
  &ldquo;Remember, too, the stock I had when further west you roam,<br>

  <p>&rsquo;Twas early in the Summer, and the days were very hot,<br>
    The free selector&rsquo;s cattle made for every shaded spot:<br>
    And out among the stations boundary riders lay asleep,<br>
    With: &ldquo;Never mind the fences&mdash; or the squatter&rsquo;s blessed
    sheep,&rdquo;<br>
    When some one down the country heard of Meranburn afar,<br>
    Where five and thirty &ldquo;kiddys&rdquo; (some in shearing time could tar
    )<br>
    Had never one been christened, and the truth he meant to learn,<br>
    And sent a parson westward, on his way to Meranburn. <br>
    He crossed the old Canoblas, and in time was in the scrub,<br>
    And camped with a selector, who had just begun to grub;<br>
    And news of him to every home went through that very night,<br>
    And ere the moon, and stars above, gave way to greater light<br>
    The &ldquo;kids&rdquo; were gone, but none knew where, and men with whips
    and spurs <br>
    Rode down the winding bridle paths, and through the Bathurst burrs,<br>
    And women, milking, left the cows, and many left the churn:<br>
  &ldquo;They must be found, a parson&rsquo;s come,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;to
  Meranburn.&rdquo;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas late when Johnny Fletcher heard the news, which made him grin<br>
    (The chap that lately bolted with a Lachlan River gin);<br>
    He mounted on his horse at once, and rode as bushmen do<br>
    (The sheep dog through the scrub that ran he&rsquo;d got at Dandaloo,)<br>
    He searched the gullies, deep and wide, and cantered here and there,<br>
    And not a nag kept pace with him but Charlie Wilson&rsquo;s mare.<br>
    By Coate&rsquo;s creek, and everywhere, through mountain, scrub and fern,<br>
    They went, but failed to find that day the &ldquo;kids&rdquo; from Meranburn.<br>
    And when another morning broke they saw the dog was gone,<br>
    But took no heed, nor mentioned it, and still the search went on,<br>
    And when the sun grew hot above, they met their just reward&mdash;<br>
    They found the dog had mustered them, and had them in the yard!<br>
    And Charlie Wilson cantered home: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got &rsquo;em good in
    count.<br>
    The &lsquo;kids&rsquo; are five and thirty strong, and out at MacKie&rsquo;s
    Mount.&rdquo;<br>
    And though Jack Fletcher&rsquo;s wife <i>was</i> black, he did them such
    a &ldquo;turn &rdquo;<br>
    That he is held in high esteem, henceforth, at Meranburn.<br>
    The mothers named while thankful dads now ran &rsquo;em down the race,<br>
    The while the parson water splashed on every &ldquo;kiddy&rsquo;s&rdquo; face.<br>
    And now by settler&rsquo;s hearth and home, and by the teamster&rsquo;s log, <br>
    Do bushmen sit and spin the yarn of Johnny Fletcher&rsquo;s dog.<br>
    And Fletcher, though the dog is old, with no teeth in his mouth,<br>
    Still brags of him to shearer chaps, and fellows from the south.<br>

    Again and again he looked out at the rain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With, &ldquo;let not our plans be upset,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly pay off the parsonage debt.<br>
    It is true that we needed this glorious rain,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear the soft low laugh,<br>

  <p>I&rsquo;m very tired of city life, and wish that I was back,<br>
    To run the horses in again, along the bridle track&mdash;<br>
    To hear the bull-frog bell across the flat behind the hill,<br>
    To rise and early go to work with harrow, plough, or drill.<br>
    My love from home and western farm no town will ever win,<br>
    Where I arose at break of day to bring the horses in.<br>
    What though I rose to see a frost, and all the fences white,<br>
    I rode with pride the pony I had stabled overnight.<br>
    And every morning down the road, not far from Bates&rsquo;s well,<br>
    I used to stop and rub my hands, and listen for the bell.<br>
    And when the bell horse shook his head, in thought I hear it now,<br>
    The horses trotted straight for home &mdash; to feed, and then to plough.<br>
    I fancy I am back again among the flowers and bees,<br>
    With team of horses, fed and groomed, a plough and swingle trees,<br>
    A headland fifteen feet across, and pegs for &quot;striking&rdquo; out,<br>
    I&rsquo;d take it on and chance the rest, the rabbits, rust, and drought,<br>
    For I am worried as I write, and I am getting thin&mdash;<br>
    I&rsquo;m not as happy now as when I ran the horses in.<br>
    But surely I am dreaming that I&rsquo;ve been so long away,<br>
    Ah no, since I last turned a sod &rsquo;tis ten long years to-day.<br>
    But when I woke this morning and the frost was on the pane,<br>
    I thought the ground was white, and I was on the farm again;<br>
    And oft I fancy that I hear (when city streets are still)<br>
    The horse&rsquo;s bell somewhere upon the flat behind the hill.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADeadBargain"></a>A Dead Bargain</b></h2>
  <p>It happened on the Lachlan, not so many years ago,<br>
    When Jack M&rsquo;Creadie&rsquo;s Waratah had proved that he could go.<br>
    He had him at the races in the district once or twice,<br>
    And used to say he wouldn&rsquo;t sell the horse at any price,<br>
    For he could mount at peep of day, and ere there rose a star<br>
    Be ninety miles away from home, on good old Waratah.<br>
    Now Ned, his brother, lived across the river opposite,<br>
    And both were noted dealers, voted shady, day or night; <br>
    No Lachlan men were better known, and many who were &ldquo;had,&rdquo;<br>
    When dealing with M&rsquo;Creadies said the brothers both were bad.<br>
    Two lying men (their faces very often bore a scar),<br>
    And Ned, the youngest, coveted the creamy Waratah.<br>
    But still his brother stuck to him, and let each offer pass,<br>
    And turned him in the paddock, where he managed on the grass;<br>
    But after days of absence in a bog he found him dead,<br>
    And in the thick of trouble came the thought of brother Ned.<br>
    So when they met together, Jack said, &ldquo;now there you are.<br>
    I&rsquo;ll take your sporting offer for the creamy Waratah.&rdquo;<br>
    And Ned M&rsquo;Crealie bought, him, giving thirty quid in cash,<br>
    But since he purchased Waratah he doesn&rsquo;t seem so flash;<br>
    And Jack, when tales of cunning deals, he hears another spin<br>
    Thinks cunningly about the way he took his brother in.</p>

  <p>Out west the man on wages gets advice on every hand,<br>
  &ldquo;The best thing you can do, by far, is settle on the land.&rdquo;<br>
    No doubt that this is good advice from one who doesn&rsquo;t know,<br>
    But those who&rsquo;ve had experience would never reason so,<br>
    For though there&rsquo;s much for capital, &rsquo;tis little you will own<br>
    In fighting single handed on a block of land alone.<br>
    You toil beneath a burning sun a dozen hours a day,<br>
    And rarely see a neighbour, for they rarely come that way.<br>
    And when the gloom of night is there, and birds have gone to rest,<br>
    You sit and wish hard for the rain, and curse the rabbit pest.<br>
    Your supper done you read awhile, or think and youth recall<br>
    The while you watch the shadow of your figure on the wall.<br>
    Or vaguely count the rafters, through your grey tobacco smoke,<br>
    And listen to the knocking of the bell upon your moke;<br>
    Then watch the box wood burn beneath the hook of fencing wire<br>
    The while the water bubbles round the mutton on the fire,<br>
    Then rise and light the candle, which you cannot keep alight<br>
    For drafts that make your lonely hut a cheerless home at night.<br>
    Of course you mean to marry, but there&rsquo;s surely time enough,<br>
    A house will go up quickly when the place is not so rough.<br>
    You strike the township often, and you never miss a chance<br>
    In gaining invitations from a neighbour to a dance,<br>
    And that is how you meet her who will be your future wife,<br>
    When you&rsquo;re fighting &ldquo;double-handed&rdquo; on your block of land
    for life. </p>

    To search for gold, with an old mate, once, and worked for a time in vain.<br>

    The dingo&rsquo;s bay when the darkness reigned, and the curlews doleful

    Slowly, surely, growing weaker, weaker, till he sank and died.<br>
    Once he rallied, speaking softly to a comrade by his bed.<br>
  &ldquo;Will you write for me to mother, just a line or two?&rdquo; he said.<br>

  &ldquo;There&rsquo;s service at my house to-night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll join us sir, in prayer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I looked to see who owned the voice,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man it was, I saw,<br>
  &ldquo;Excuse me&rdquo; said the visitor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never met before &mdash;</p>
  <p>There&rsquo;s service here but thrice a year<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And though you weary be<br>
    I&rsquo;d like to have you in our midst,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So come along with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I pointed to my shabby dress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he said, &ldquo;Never mind,<br>
    Such things are never seen by those<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Religiously inclined.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So in I went, of worshippers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I counted twenty one,<br>
    The preacher was a local man;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think his name was Dunn.</p>
  <p>And when he preached the sermon through,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said with solemn air&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Go those who must, but all may stay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And join in private prayer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I didn&rsquo;t like to leave alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I thought I&rsquo;d stay,<br>
    I knelt upon the cold bare floor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest began to pray.</p>
  <p>And through the dimly lighted room<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In turn each prayed around,<br>
    And save the night wind&rsquo;s sobs without<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard no other sound.</p>
  <p>When all had prayed, the preacher said;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The stranger over there,<br>
    The stranger kneeling in the rear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will lead us please in prayer&mdash;</p>
  <p>These prayers go in a bottle, friend,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not idle talk,<br>
    Another one and it is full,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll hammer home the cork;</p>
  <p>You're with good friends, be not afraid&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An awful place is hell.&rdquo;<br>
    He paused, and through the room again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dreadful silence fell.</p>
  <p>And then I clasped my horny hands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man of want, and care,<br>
    And I who had not prayed for years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I uttered words of prayer.</p>
  <p>I prayed not long, and when I ceased<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the rush of feet,<br>
    Bush congregations part in haste,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they seldom meet.</p>
  <p>The night was wet, and through the trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I reached the camp again,<br>
    Upon the calico I heard<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceaseless beat of rain;</p>
  <p>But long I tossed upon my bunk<br>
    With feelings of despair,<br>
    I wondered what the fellow meant<br>
    By talk of bottled prayer.</p>
  <p>And when I thought of mine on top<br>
    It made me feel afraid,<br>
    I wondered if &rsquo;twould froth like yeast,<br>
    Or fiz like lemonade.</p>
  <p>I&rsquo;ve seen bush-women bottle jam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve purchased bottled beer,<br>
    But praise like pickles, in a jar&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It did seem rather queer.</p>
  <p>The man was sane he&rsquo;d preached for years<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet how could he dare<br>
    To tell the kneeling worshippers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He bottled people&rsquo;s prayer.</p>
  <p>Oh Lord (before it is too late)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make clear Thy way to him,<br>
    Throw light upon his narrow path&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pathway very dim.</p>
  <p>May good, and pious, clergymen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Replace such men as these<br>
    Who trifle with the word of God,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And men upon their knees.</p>
  <p>And they who leave for foreign lands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pray for heathen there,<br>
    May find in our own inland wilds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As great a need for prayer.</p>
  <p>Next morning as I rolled my swag,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To leave the lonely camp,<br>
    An unconverted man of years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To face a weary tramp.</p>
  <p>I heard a sharp and sudden crash<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shook the hills of pine.<br>
    A man I met said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a blast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Geebung railway line.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But often through the day I thought<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When many miles from there,<br>
    The bottle&rsquo;s bursted, &rsquo;Twouldn&rsquo;t keep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All through a swagman&rsquo;s prayer. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheShearersLove"></a>The Shearer&rsquo;s Love</b></h2>
  <p>Beside the rails on a western farm<br>
    In early spring, on a morning calm,<br>
    A bushman tall and a maiden fair<br>
    Spoke of the life that they meant to share;<br>
    A fervent kiss, and he rode that day<br>
  &nbsp;Across the river, and far away.</p>
  <p>The roll was called for the shearing &ldquo;stands.&rdquo;<br>
    The sharp blades flashed in his comrades&rsquo; hands<br>
    And down the board did they tally keep&mdash;<br>
    But not another could handle sheep<br>
    Like him who went to his &ldquo;stand&rdquo; to make<br>
    The shearing fast for a fair girl&rsquo;s sake.</p>
  <p>Her dainty notes as they came to hand<br>
    Renewed his strength as he held his &ldquo;stand,&rsquo;<br>
    And when for weeks not a line had come<br>
    He said, &ldquo;Ah! well I will soon be home.&rdquo;<br>
    The shearing done, he was free at last<br>
    He caught his horse and he travelled fast.</p>
  <p>A faithless girl, and a journey strange&mdash;<br>
    Now in his life came a wretched change.<br>
    Though envied long by a mate he knew,<br>
    He never thought she could prove untrue,<br>
    But finds it so, for the neighbours say:<br>
  &ldquo;She married another yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An old, old tale, that is often told&mdash;<br>
    His block of land to the squatter sold.<br>
    Devoid of hope, and in deep despair<br>
    He could not think now of living there<br>
    He said, he thought he would take a spell,<br>
  &ldquo;Now he humps his swag,&rdquo; the neighbours tell,</p>
  <p>And still in spring to a shed he goes<br>
    And works awhile, then the Job he throws,<br>
    For only there for a time works he,<br>
    Then raves to mates in a drunken spree<br>
    And ever speaks of the scented grove,<br>
    And the faithless girl he used to love.</p>
