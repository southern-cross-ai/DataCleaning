    Captain Amos Bennett Seeks A New Second Mate</b></h2>
  <p>The <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, of New Bedford, had just dropped anchor in the
    Bay of Islands, and Captain Amos Bennett, came ashore to look for men. But
    the skipper of the <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, was pretty well known, and although
    there were plenty of men, both whites and natives, to be had by any other
    whale-ship captain there was none anxious to try his luck in the <i>Passmore</i>.
    It was far better, they argued, for them to do another month or two of solid
    loafing ashore, where there was plenty of cheap grog and where the charms
    of very unconventional Maori female society were so easily available, and
    wait for another whale-ship to come along, than to ship in the <i>Kellet
    Passmore</i>. For it was pretty generally known, from Talcahuana on the west
    coast of South America to Kororareka in the Bay of Islands on the coast of
    New Zealand, that Captain Bennett wasn&rsquo;t a nice man to sail with, and
    those who did sail with him, whether the <i>Passmore</i> met with bad luck
    or &ldquo;greasy&rdquo; luck, generally left her at the first port she touched
    at after a cruise with broken noses, smashed jaws or fractured ribs, superinduced
    by knuckle-dusters, belaying-pins and other cheerless incentives to industry
    weilded by the unsparing hands of Captain Amos Bennett and the after-guard
    of his ship.</p>
  <p>Smoking an extremely long and very strong cigar, Captain Bennett slouched
    into the leading combined store and grog shanty which, in those days was
    the rendezvous of everyone living in the Bay, and in amiable tones invited
    every one present to &ldquo;come and hev suthin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Some twelve
    or fifteen men, whites, Kanakas and Maoris, who were loafing about the store
    in expectation of the captain&rsquo;s visit, accepted his invitation with
    sundry nods, pushes and winks among themselves, and after drinking a stiff
    tot of what was known locally as &ldquo;hell biled down to a small half-pint,&rdquo; Mauta,
    a Tongan half-caste boat-steerer, respectfully asked the captain if he had
    had much luck on his present cruise.</p>
  <p>This was Captain Bennett&rsquo;s opportunity, and for the following ten
    minutes he lied rapidly and artistically about the <i>Pasmore&rsquo;s</i> wonderful
    luck in past cruises, but admitted that on the present one, since he had
    left New Bedford five months before he had taken but three whales,  &ldquo;princerpully&rdquo; he
    said, &ldquo;on accaount of some passengers I hev aboard who are in a h&mdash; of
    a hurry ter get up ter Ponap&eacute; in the Caroline group.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Traders, Captain Bennett?&rdquo; asked the storekeeper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied the American, drawing up one of his long legs,
    clasping his long arms around his knee and shutting his left eye, &ldquo;missionaries
    from Bosting, agoin&rsquo;  daown ter the Carolines ter save the ragin&rsquo; heathen
    in his blindness from bowin&rsquo; daown ter wood an&rsquo; stone, and tew
    teach them ter charge a dollar each for a chicken tew the ungodly and Gentile
    sailor man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The men laughed, and Captain Bennett, without moving a muscle of his long,
    solemn visage, nodded to the storekeeper to fill the glasses again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No wonder you losa the whala, captain,&rdquo; said a short, muscular
    Portuguese, who wanted a ship but had no intention of trying the <i>Kellet
    Passmore</i> with her present commander, &ldquo;de dam missionara he bringa
    you bada lucka, eh?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal,&rdquo;  said Bennett, eyeing the speaker keenly through his
    half-closed eyes, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that, because its jest my own
    fault. Yew see, boys, its just this way. These here people &mdash;a man and
    two females&mdash;are darned anxious ter get down ter the Carolines, and
    the Bosting Board of Missions paid me five hundred dollars each for &rsquo;em
    to give &rsquo;em a passage in my ship. Consikently, although we saw whales
    often enough I only lowered after &rsquo;em three times, when they was close
    to. Yew see, these here people heving paid a big passage money, air entitled
    to get there ez quick ez I can take &rsquo;em.</p>
  <p>An incredulous grin went round among the men, which Bennett affected not
    to notice, then he resumed by remarking that as he always liked to do the
    square thing he was going to count the fifteen hundred dollars passage money
    as part of the ship&rsquo;s take.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That sounds square,&rdquo; whispered a white sailor to a young, seamanlike-man
    who sat upon a case at the further end of the store. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t
    be a bad sort. I&rsquo;m for one, if he wants men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lies,&rdquo;  said the young fellow, &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t let me
    stop you. I can tell you all about him though. He&rsquo;s the two ends and
    bight of a lying swab.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having given those present two drinks each, Captain Bennett got to business,
    and lighting another cigar, asked them if any of them wanted to try their
    luck in the <i>Passmore</i>.</p>
  <p>But although they drank his rum cheerfully and were willing to drink more,
    and listened with stolid complacency to his alluring inducements about a
    full ship in twelve months, he talked in vain.</p>
  <p>Then the deep fountains of Captain Amos Bennett&rsquo;s blasphemy were broken
    up, and having violently cursed each man separately and the lot collectively,
    and insinuated that they were not fit to tend cows, let alone kill whales,
    he withdrew to look for men elsewhere.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>An hour or two later he strode down towards his boat with five Maori hands
    in tow. When close to the beach some one hailed him from the rear, and the
    leathern-visaged Yankee, chawing fiercely at his Manilla, slewed round on
    his heel and, with needless profanity, asked the speaker what the &mdash; he
    wanted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I believe you want men, sir,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not the kinder men bummin&rsquo; around here, anyway,&rdquo; snarled
    Bennett, recognising in the man who spoke to him the young fellow who had
    sat upon the box in the corner of the store; and then looking at the bronzed
    face and muscular figure of his questioner, he asked,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Air yew one of them Yahoos I was talkin&rsquo; to while back?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was there,&rdquo; replied the young man quietly, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; and
    he stepped directly in front of the American, &ldquo;if you call me a Yahoo
    you&rsquo;ll lose a good man for the <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, and get a hell
    of a bashing into the bargain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The skipper of the <i>Passmore</i> was no coward, but he knew he would stand
    a poor show with the man before him, and he wanted men badly. His thin face
    underwent some hideous squirmings and contortions intended for an amused
    smile. &ldquo;Young feller, yew hev some spirit; I kin see that rightaway.
    Naow, I do want men, and yew want a ship, and the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> is
    jest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stow all that,&rdquo; said the man coolly. &ldquo;<i>I</i> know all
    about the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> and all about you, too. I&rsquo;m willing
    to go in her for a cruise. I think it&rsquo;ll take a smarter man than you
    to haze me&mdash;so don&rsquo;t try it on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The audacity of this speech seemed to stagger the Yankee considerably, but
    he soon recovered himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yew air mighty smart, young feller,&rdquo; he said presently, in
    a low, rasping voice, and his thin lips parted and showed his yellow teeth; &ldquo;and
    what sorter persition aboard of my ship may I hev the honor ev askin&rsquo; yew
    to take?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Any d&mdash;d thing you like. I hear you&rsquo;ve got a lot of cripples
    for boat-steerers; and you can&rsquo;t get a better man than me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do tell,&rdquo; and Bennett grinned sarcastically, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;ll
    be a darned different sort from any other Britisher that ever went whalin&rsquo;.
    Been in the business long, young feller?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten years or so, off and on,&rdquo; was the impatient reply.</p>
  <p>The skipper beckoned to his boat&rsquo;s crew, who lay upon their oars waiting
    for him, to back on to the beach, then with a quick glance at the other man,
    he said</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo;  come aboard, young feller; I guess we&rsquo;ll pull together.
    Seems to me your face is kinder familiar like tew me. What was your last
    ship?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The <i>Wanderer</i>, of Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Boat-steerer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, not in the <i>Wanderer</i>. I was boat-steerer six years ago
    in the <i>Prudence Hopkins</i>, of New Bedford. I was mate of the <i>Wanderer</i>.
    Got any more questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another attempt at a pleasant smile distorted Captain Bennett&rsquo;s features&mdash;&ldquo;Waal,
    naow, see here; this is surprisin&rsquo;! Why, I cert&rsquo;nly thought I
    reckernised yew. Yew was in the <i>Wanderer</i> in Vavau, daown in the Friendly
    Islands, &rsquo;bout a year ago. Why, I remember comin&rsquo; aboard ev that
    thar ship one day.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So do I,&rdquo; nonchantly replied the young man; &lsquo;a couple
    of your hands&mdash;Kanakas &mdash;swam off to our ship from yours and you
    wanted to get them back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s so, mister. I remember the circumstances exactly. Darned
    lazy cusses they were, too.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Think so? <i>I </i>don&rsquo;t. We had them with us on the <i>Wanderer</i> for
    ten months; better men never struck a fish. <i>You</i> could&rsquo;nt get
    anything out of them, though.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mister, I could not. They belonged to the Matelotas Islands, in the
    Carolines, and when my second mate started to rouse &rsquo;em around and
    knock some of their darned Kanaka laziness outer them, they actooaly driv
    a knife inter him, and darned near killed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Served him&mdash;well right,&rdquo; was the curt response.</p>
  <p>The American captain kept silence for a while, and nought broke the silence
    save the sound of the oars as the boat swept quickly over toward the <i>Kellet
    Passmore</i>.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
    On Board The &ldquo;<i>Kellet Passmore&rdquo;</i></b></h2>
  <p>In a few minutes the boat ranged alongside, the five new Maori hands, preceded
    by Captain Bennett and the other white man, clambered up on deck, and the
    boat was about to be passed astern, when the skipper called to the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Herrera, I reckon yew kin&rsquo; keep the boat alongside. Thar&rsquo;s
    goin&rsquo; ter be some changes aboard this ship in a few minutes, and thet
    boat&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; ashore agin.&rdquo; </p>
  <p>The mate, a dark-browed, black-whiskered man of thirty-five or so, whose
    regular features and olive complexion shewed him to be either a Spaniard
    or a Portuguese, answered the rasping accents of the Yankee skipper with
    a soft, modulated &ldquo;Aye, aye, sir,&rdquo; and nodding a &ldquo;Good-day,
    sir&rdquo; to the stranger, whom he could see, was, by his dress and demeanour,
    no common seaman, turned away to execute his captain&rsquo;s orders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come below, mister,&rdquo; said Bennett leading the way into the
    cabin.</p>
  <p>There was no one in the cabin but the mulatto steward, who was laying the
    table, and the captain, talking a seat, motioned his visitor to another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yew was sayin&rsquo; Mr.&mdash;; I disremember naow ef yew told
    me your name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Barrington  &mdash; John Barrington,&rdquo; said the other, looking
    directly into Bennett&rsquo;s eyes and stroking his well-trimmed and pointed
    beard.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, Mr. Barrington, I ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; ter go jaw long
    over this business. I want men, that&rsquo;s what I came in here to this
    rotten hole fur. Waal, I&rsquo;ve got five Maoris, and I reckon that&rsquo;s
    all I will get. But I want a second mate.&rdquo; Barrington nodded, and still
    stroking his beard, waited for more.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, look here. I rather think you&rsquo;ll suit me, although,&rdquo; and
    here the skipper scratched a bony cheek meditatively and squinted atrociously, &ldquo;although
    yew air a Britisher, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re a Down East Yank, used to Down East mates, and Dago
    second mates, and mangy greasers of all sorts. I&rsquo;m a Britisher, as
    you say; but if you don&rsquo;t want me, why the blazes did you bring me
    aboard? This rotten old crate of yours isn&rsquo;t the only whale-ship in
    the Pacific!&rdquo; and Barrington took up his hat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit daown, mister, sit daown, and don&rsquo;t yew use sich vi&rsquo;lent
    language,&rdquo; and Bennett indicated by a backward jerk of his dirty thumb
    and another villianous squint, a half-opened cabin door at his back, &ldquo;thar&rsquo;s
    females in thar, mister, &mdash;  females from Bosting,&rdquo; and he grinned.</p>
  <p>Barrington muttered an apology, not to the captain, but to the soft murmur
    of women&rsquo;s voices that he now heard for the first time.</p>
  <p>The hatchet-faced skipper pondered a moment, and then said briskly, &ldquo;Look
    here, naow, it&rsquo;s no use either you or me backin&rsquo; and fillin&rsquo; in
    this ridiklous kinder way. My second mate wants to leave, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t
    too dreadful anxious to stop him&mdash;he don&rsquo;t suit me by no means.
    Naow, yew want a ship an&rsquo; I want an officer. I ain&rsquo;t got but
    two boat-headers in the ship worth a cuss; so ef yew are willin&rsquo;, waal,
    I&rsquo;m willin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to make the cruise with you. I only want to get
    up to the Carolines. If you like to put me ashore anywhere near Ponap&eacute;,
    or Truk, or a little island called L&#335;sap, I&rsquo;m willing to do second
    mate&rsquo;s duty aboard. I don&rsquo;t want a &lsquo;cut in&rsquo; if we
    kill any whales between here and there&mdash;all I want is a passage to any
    one of the places I&rsquo;ve named.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young man, ef yew want a free passage in this ship, I recken yew
    hev got to pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as you like; I&rsquo;m able and willing to pay; but then, mind,
    I don&rsquo;t do a hand&rsquo;s turn aboard this ship if I pay my passage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What might be your objek, mister, in going daown thar at all, ef
    yew don&rsquo;t mind my askin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An angry reply was on the young man&rsquo;s lips; but he stopped it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what the devil it concerns you&mdash;if I go as
    a passenger, but I will tell you. I was trading down on Ponap&eacute; a little
    over two years ago, and got tired of it. I ran out of trade goods, and had
    no money to buy any. So I shipped again in the <i>Wanderer</i>, and the skipper
    landed my native wife at L&#335;sap, where her mother&rsquo;s people belong.
    She&rsquo;s to wait there till I return. Then I&rsquo;m going back to Ponap&eacute;,
    or Yap, or any other place where there&rsquo;s money to be made. I&rsquo;ve
    got no trade, but have money enough to buy some from the first ship that
    comes along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bennett considered a moment or two and then said, &ldquo;Waal, young fellow,
    I recken we can make a deal&mdash;whar do yew say yew want to go ashore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;L&#335;sap, if you happen to hit it. That&rsquo;s where my native
    wife is living; if not, Truk, or one of the islands thereabouts will do me.
    I&rsquo;m bound to get a passage to L&#335;sap from Truk in one of the big
    canoes that go there once a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal, mister, I&rsquo;ll send my second mate ashore here,
    and be darned to him, and yew can take his place. Ef we don&rsquo;t get set
    too fur to the eastward by the current&mdash; there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; but
    ragin&rsquo; calms and blarsted hurricanes up about there this time of the
    year&mdash;I&rsquo;ll land yew on L&#335;sap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right,&rdquo;  said Barrington, &ldquo;when you send the boat ashore
    here with your second mate, let your men get my chest from the store. It&rsquo;s
    all ready packed, and nothing to pay on it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naow, thet&rsquo;s business. I kin see that yew an&rsquo; me&rsquo;ll
    git along bully. Here, steward, bring us suthin&rsquo; to drink, an&rsquo; then
    tell Mr. Duggan I want him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having secured a man whom he was sure would prove a good officer, Captain
    Amos Bennett was now in a good temper, and in a few minutes after he had
    settled with Barrington he had told him all about the voyage of the <i>Kellet
    Passmore</i> since she had left New Bedford, and the shortcomings of his
    crew. Then his natural inborn curiosity asserted itself again, and he began
    to question Barrington as to his reasons for leaving the <i>Wanderer</i>, &ldquo;which,
    fer a colonial whaler was most extror&rsquo;nary lucky.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Drinking off his grog, the young man put his hand inside his coat, drew
    out some papers and laid them on the table. There was an angry light in his
    eye, which the inqusitive American was not slow to perceive, and he began&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, I don&rsquo;t want to pester yew onnesscessarily like, but
    I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington interrupted him,&mdash; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. I left
    the <i>Wanderer </i>in Sydney two months ago, and came over here to look
    out for another ship. Why I left her doesn&rsquo;t concern you. I was not
    asked to leave her, as that will show you, Captain Bennett,&rdquo; and he
    handed him a letter, &ldquo;do you know Captain Codrington? He&rsquo;s a countryman
    of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather think I did. He&rsquo;s from daown my way&mdash;Martha&rsquo;s
    Vineyard &mdash; an&rsquo; a real smart man, although he did take to whalin&rsquo; under
    the British flag,&rdquo; and Captain Bennett gave an amicable snort, and
    took the paper offered to him.</p>
  <p>It contained but a few lines, saying that the writer, William Codrington,
    regretted that Barrington had decided to leave the <i>Wanderer</i>, and urging
    him to reconsider the matter.</p>
  <p>Just then the steward came in, and Bennett, handing the letter back, said &ldquo;Wher&rsquo;s
    Mr. Duggan, steward?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On deck, sir,&rdquo; answered Herrera, the mate, who just then came
    in the cabin.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Send him down, then,&rdquo; and an unpleasant look came over Bennett&rsquo;s
    face.</p>
  <p>The mate, as he turned to go, passed the half-opened cabin door on the starboard
    side. He pulled it to gently, and, with something like a smile on his face,
    went on deck and called out &mdash; &ldquo;Mr. Duggan, come below, please.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few seconds a short, stout man tramped down the companion-way and stood
    in front of the captain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Duggan, yew don&rsquo;t suit me, and I&rsquo;m quite willin&rsquo; fur
    yew ter go ashore&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m d&mdash;d glad to get clear of you, and this rotten
    old hooker of a barque. You&rsquo;re a lying bully, and this ship ain&rsquo;t
    fit for a white man to sail in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not fur white-livered sort like yew, Duggan,&rdquo; snarled back
    Bennett. &ldquo;Why, yew ain&rsquo;t fit fur anything better&rsquo;n codfishin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is too good and honest a man to remain on board this ship, Captain
    Bennett,&rdquo;  said a soft voice and a young woman opened the cabin door
    that the mate had closed, and stepped into the main cabin. Bennett dropped
    his eyes and made no answer.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And so you are going, Mr. Duggan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my sister
    and I will miss you very much. Good-bye,&rdquo; and she put her white hand
    into Duggan&rsquo;s huge paw.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Miss Trenton, and God bless you, miss, and bring you safe
    home again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Almost ere Barrington could get more than a glance at the girl&rsquo;s pale
    face and deep hazel eyes, she had entered her cabin again and closed the
    door, and the second mate was addressing his farewell remarks to the captain,
    the which, once he was assured that the young lady was out of hearing, he
    concluded by consigning Bennett to flames and perdition in a vigorous but
    lucid manner. Then he tramped off on deck again, where the mate was awaiting
    him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Duggan,&rdquo; said Herrera, holding out his hand, &ldquo;I
    am sorry you and the old man can&rsquo;t agree; but you and I part friends,
    don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes&mdash;yes. I&rsquo;ve got nothing against you. You only knock
    the men about from force of habit; Bennett does it from pure natural cussedness.
    Well, anyway, I wish the ship luck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thanks. I don&rsquo;t like Bennett much myself, but I like the old <i>Passmore</i>.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Especially when there&rsquo;s a passenger like Nellie Trenton aboard.
    Look here, Herrera, just you mind your bearings. You ain&rsquo;t a fit man
    for a girl like that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dark, handsome face flushed, and with a curt &ldquo;good-bye,&rdquo; the
    mate walked away, and Duggan went down the side into the boat and was pulled
    ashore.</p>
  <p>By sunset the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> was underweigh again, heading for Tongatabu,
    in the Friendly Islands, where Bennett intended cruising for a few weeks
    before going to the northward.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Just before supper that evening, Barrington went below to get a pipe of
    tobacco. The lamp had not yet been lit, and the spacious cabin of the old
    barque was in semi-darkness. He was turning to go on deck again, when Captain
    Bennett, who was standing talking to some one, called him over and introduced
    him to the Reverend Hosea Parker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; muttered Barrington under his breath, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
    that meddlesome Yankee Baptist parson that was always worrying N&#257;dee
    about her soul;&rdquo; but he put out his hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How are you, Mr. Barrington? Is it well with you?&rdquo; said the
    missionary, who always affected a Scriptural style of address. &ldquo; &rsquo;Tis
    indeed strange we meet again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right, thank you. said Barrington quietly, and then
    he added &ldquo;I did not imagine it was you and Mrs. Parker who were on
    board; I trust she is well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well, I thank the Lord, Mr. Barrington, she will be here presently.
    And how comes it, Mr. Barrington, that we meet you here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m getting back again. And may I ask the same question
    of you, Mr. Parker. How comes it that you are so far away from Ponap&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It pleased Providence that the <i>Morning Star</i>, our missionary
    ship, should be cast away on Strong&rsquo;s Island, a year back. My wife
    and I, who were then in America, thus had no means of returning to our post,
    save by a whale-ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! I see,&rdquo; and Barrington, who had no wish to hear any more,
    went on deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Says it was Providence ez wrecked that thar brig, does he,&rdquo; said
    Captain Bennett to his new second mate, as he followed him on deck, &ldquo;waal,
    ef that ain&rsquo;t rich! Providence, hey? It was just because the darned
    wooden-headed galoot of a captin&rsquo; hed&rsquo;n&rsquo;t got sense enough
    ter try and tow her off when the current swep&rsquo;  her again&rsquo; the
    rocks; instead of doin&rsquo; which he let go his anchor in &rsquo;bout a
    mile deep of water, and trusted to Providence. Consikently when she swung
    round she bashed her starn inter pulp on the reef. I hain&rsquo;t got no
    patience with creatures that get inter a hell of a mess and then start yowlin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout
    the will of Providence and sich. It&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; sickenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Half an hour afterwards, when Barrington came down to supper, Helen Parker
    rose to meet him with extended hand. Her face was deadly pale, but the quick
    eye of Jos&eacute;  Herrera saw that her hand trembled and a deep rose colour
    momentarily flooded her face from brow to chin.</p>
  <p>Some mere common-place escaped her as Barrington took her hand, and she
    said, &ldquo;This is my sister, Mr. Barrington. I have just been telling
    her that you and I were not strangers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The hazel-eyed, curly-haired girl who sat by her rose and shook hands with
    the new officer, and said, with a straight look at the tan-hided countenance
    of Amos Bennett,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. Barrington. I am sorry Mr. Duggan has gone; but
    hope I will like you as much as I did him.&rdquo; The new second mate laughed,
    and even Bennett gave his cachinnatory snuffle; but Mrs. Parker kept her
    pale face bent over her plate, and never raised it again till supper was
    over.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Barrington that night to Herrera, as the two
    sat smoking in the latter&rsquo;s cabin for a few minutes, &ldquo;that that
    pretty girl is going down to the Carolines to marry some pasty-faced Yankee
    missionary like the Reverend Hosea Parker?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Herrera, who lay out at full length in his bunk smoking a Manilla, raised
    himself on one elbow and looked searchingly at his fellow-officer, his black
    eyes shining and sparkling in the darkness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not if I can help it, Mr. Barrington,&rdquo; he said.</p>
  <p>Barrington was startled, but said nothing; and then, Herrera, still leaning
    his black bearded chin upon his hand, spoke again in his soft, finely modulated
    voice.  &ldquo;Which, Mr. Barrington, think you is the most beautiful of
    the two.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; replied Barrington carelessly; &ldquo;both
    are good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good-looking! Mother of God! Both are lovely&mdash;and, Senor Barrington,
    the wife of that ugly devil of a padre looked at you in a way that I would
    give five years of my life for her sister to so look at me. My friend, that
    woman is in love with you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Mr. Herrera,&rdquo; said Barrington coldly, &ldquo;and
    I may as well tell you that I&rsquo;ve got a wife&mdash;as good a girl as
    ever I want; and it&rsquo;s not in my nature to run after any one else&rsquo;s
    wife; and I&rsquo;m going back to her now, poor little devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The dark-faced mate laid back again and smiled softly to himself.</p>
  <p>Presently he resumed, &ldquo;I do not want to ask impertinent questions
    of you, but is your wife young and beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington nodded.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah! Then you have no eyes for another woman. But, tell me: Is it
    not a very wonderful thing that such a beautiful woman as the padre&rsquo;s&mdash;parson
    as you call him&mdash;this padre&rsquo;s wife, should marry such a man? <i>Dios!</i> he
    is as ugly as a sunfish&mdash;and with no more brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I daresay he&rsquo;s a good enough man in his way,&rdquo; replied
    Barrington; &ldquo;but, as you say, he&rsquo;s got no brains.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate laughed&mdash;&ldquo;And she cares no more for him than she does
    for black Manuel, the ship&rsquo;s cook! Truly, it is wonderful that so sweet
    a woman should marry a miserable little priest.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
    The Wife Of The Reverend Hosea Parker</b></h2>
  <p>Certainly, there was something to wonder about, for the Reverend Hosea Parker
    was about the last man in the world one would expect to see marry a lively
    and intelligent woman, for, while possessing features as homely as a stone
    jug they were not half so expressive. Like a great many of his colleagues,
    however, he was not as bad as he looked, and honestly believed that Providence
    intended him for a great mission&mdash;<i>i.e</i>. to convert the heathen
    from his blindness. Until the age of thirty or so he had, to use his own
    words, been &ldquo;in the world, a worldly man&rdquo; earning a living as
    a compositor on a Boston religious newspaper largely devoted to alarmist
    statements about the vast numbers of South Sea Islanders who were hurrying
    to perdition for want of missionary effort. The confined nature of his occupation
    and a course of attendances at revival meetings, at one of which he fell
    down in a fit, led to a serious illness, from which he recovered a &ldquo;concerned&rdquo; man.
    Six months afterwards he was accepted as a labourer in the mission field;
    and a natural, rough eloquence he possessed so worked upon the feelings of
    Helen Trenton, one of the young members of a Boston church in which he was
    preaching one Sunday, that she&mdash;in her turn &mdash;went into hysterics.
    On being brought to she found the Rev. Hosea Parker and her mother by her
    side in her parents&rsquo; house, and they being very wealthy but pious people,
    requested the rugged-faced preacher to question her as to whether she was
    feeling &ldquo;concerned.&rdquo; The result was that &mdash;while under a
    sort of mild religious mania&mdash;twelve months later she became Mrs. Hosea
    and went out with him to the Caroline Islands. Six years&rsquo;  residence
    among the unconventional people of those parts convinced her that if her
    husband was intended for a saver of souls she was not, and that Providence
    or the tropical climate had dealt very hardly with her in the matter of her
    complexion. After a short visit to her native city, she was now returning
    with her husband with a despairing feeling in her heart that she wasn&rsquo;t
    so good a woman as her Boston friends supposed her to be, and that the advent
    of a young English trader to Ponap&eacute;, where she was engaged in hopelessly &ldquo;labouring&rdquo; to
    instruct the native girls in morality, had a good deal to do with it.</p>
  <p>But that was three or four years ago and the English trader had gone away
    out of her life altogether when one day a whale-ship called in to buy turtle
    and poultry and let the crew indulge in the usual amusements common to whalers&rsquo;  crews
    in the North Pacific Islands.</p>
  <p>That evening the Reverend Hosea Parker had told her in his solemn wooden-headed
    manner that the captain of the whaler had told him that he had lost one of
    his officers during the voyage, and had shipped Barrington in his place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And I really must say, Helen, that I am not sorry to see that young
    man go away from here. His manner of life here is a standing reproach to
    us both, and I have wrestled hard for him but without avail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is no worse than most of the white men in these islands, Hosea,&rdquo; she
    had said timidly. &ldquo;You must remember that by the native custom N&#257;dee
    is his wife&mdash;just as much as I am yours. I am afraid Hosea. that you
    and I are a little bit prejudiced against John Barrington.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Poor little woman! She wasn&rsquo;t prejudiced against the good-looking,
    devil-may-care English trader, but she included herself &mdash;merely as
    a salve to her wifely conscience.</p>
  <p>The Reverend Hosea sat down and placing his hands upon his knees looked
    into his wife&rsquo;s face with the same expression he was wont to employ
    when reprimanding one of his native girl pupils for indulging in the forbidden
    pleasures of a heathen dance on the beach by moonlight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have you possibly forgotten what that young man said to me when I
    called upon him with reference to the deplorable and wicked life he is leading?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Hosea had not forgotten. Indeed she had been present and within hearing
    on the occasion, and was not likely to forget the incident.</p>
  <p>However, being a wise woman, she said nothing, and when that evening Mr.
    John Barrington strolled nonchalantly up to the mission house to say good
    bye to the Reverend Hosea to whom, although he had always been at loggerheads
    with him, the trader bore no malice, pretty Mrs. Parker stifled her desire
    to cry, and said good-bye bravely enough. Then, when from the mission house
    verandah, she saw the <i>Tuscana</i> slowly sail out of Jakoits Harbour,
    she went back into the sitting room and sobbing softly to herself wondered
    what would have happened if she had met handsome Jack Barrington before the
    Reverend Hosea Parker had convinced her that she was a fitting colleague
    for him to help to save the souls of the &ldquo;perishing&rdquo; heathen
    in the Caroline Islands. And so, as she thought, the one man who could have
    been anything to her, passed away out of her life, and his absence seemed
    to accentuate the personal homeliness of feature of the Reverend Hosea more
    and more every day; so much so that one day during the voyage back she told
    her sister Kate, who was coming out to the islands with her to stay, that
    she didn&rsquo;t care a straw about either the dull-minded man she had married
    or the heathen in whom he took such a useless interest.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;The big hazel eyes of Kate Trenton opened in shocked surprise. The
    day had been close and sultry and the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> was lying becalmed
    with the pitch bubbling up between her deck planking, and the two women felt
    half stifled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Helen,&rdquo; said the girl stroking her sister&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;the
    weather has upset you&mdash;I know I feel it myself, Even Mr. Herrera is
    going about wearing a wide straw hat instead of his usual cap.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kate,&rdquo;  and Mrs. Parker sat up on the lounge where she had
    been lying down endeavoring to read, &ldquo;Kate, do you know that Mr. Herrera
    seems to take altogether too much interest in you. You surely would not be
    foolish enough to let yourself care for him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kate Trenton turned her face away for a moment or two from her sister&rsquo;s
    eyes, and made no answer but her cheek reddened visibly.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the older woman drew her down beside her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What a hypocrite I am, Kate, to talk like this to you. Of course
    I know you love him and he you, and &mdash; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl put her hand over her sister&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hush, Helen, don&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But I do say it, dear. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you? Don&rsquo;t make
    the horrible mistake that I have made&mdash;marry a man to please your parents
    and then meet some one that you like better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen!&rdquo;  and Kate put her arms lovingly around her, alarmed
    at something that sounded dangerously like the first break of a sob in her
    voice, &ldquo;surely, dear, you have never met anyone whom you have cared
    for in that way, but Hosea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mention of Hosea&rsquo;s name broke up Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s resolution
    never to tell Kate anything about the matter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; she whimpered, &ldquo;and the horrible part of
    it was that he lived quite close to us, and although he and I met very often
    I don&rsquo;t believe he ever gave me a thought, and when he went away the
    cruel wretch asked me if I would mind letting (sob) his wife stay with me
    (sob) until he came (sob) back for her.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen! what dreadful things you are telling me. What does it all
    mean. Who was this man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I might as well tell you all about it, Kate,&rdquo; she said wearily, &ldquo;I
    don&rsquo;t suppose I shall ever see him again and I want you to see what
    a silly fool I have been about a man that I suppose would have made game
    about &lsquo;the missionary&rsquo;s wife&rsquo;  among his rough associates
    had he known that I cared for him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Helen!&rdquo; and Kate Trenton&rsquo;s hand stole into hers.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;We Cannot Put New Wine Into Old Bottles&rdquo;</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;He was, or rather had been, a mate on a Sydney whaleship, but quarrelled
    with his captain&rdquo; &mdash;her face flushed scarlet&mdash; &ldquo;quarrelled
    over a native girl, and Barrington&mdash;that was his name&mdash;broke the
    captain&rsquo;s jaw with a blow of his fist and then deserted. All this took
    place at an island hundred of miles away from Ponap&eacute;. The ship sailed
    without him and a few months afterwards he turned up at a native village
    about four miles from the mission; he brought with him a young girl and an
    old hag. The natives took a great liking to him and he lived with them for
    a month or so until a trading ship called, and the captain sold him some
    trade goods; the next thing we heard was that the chief had built him a house &mdash;for
    himself and N&#257;dee, his native wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen! Surely you could never have cared for a man who would disgrace
    himself in that way, even had you been a free woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Parker laughed sarcastically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My dear Kate, when you have lived a few years in the islands you
    will hold different opinions about a man &lsquo;disgracing&rsquo; himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It <i>is</i> a disgrace, Helen,&rdquo; said the girl hotly, &ldquo;supposing
    one of our brothers married a colored woman, what would you and I&mdash;what
    would the world think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In America or Europe, that he had shocking bad taste&mdash;in the
    South Sea Islands that he meant to settle down and live decently.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen! How can you, a missionary&rsquo;s wife, say such things. What
    would your husband&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page072"></a><br>
  <img src="2001271h-images/page072.jpg" width="520" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;My husband, Kate, is only a unit in a vast crowd of silly people
    who throw away millions of dollars every year in sending out people sillier
    than themselves to worry heathen people about their souls.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, Helen. Is this the end of your once great hope. I remember
    how fervent you once were about coming out with Hosea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, so do I, Kate,&rdquo; she answered desperately, pushing back
    her hair wearily from her temples, &ldquo;but I know better now. I wish mother
    and father hadn&rsquo;t been quite so pious. Then I would never have met
    and married that estimable blockhead, the Reverend Ho&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For shame, Helen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sick and tired of it all, Kate. If you were not with me
    I would jump overboard. Perhaps if I hadn&rsquo;t met that wretched Englishman
    I would have gone on all right to the end in the laudable effort to put new
    wine into old bottles, meaning thereby to cram simple native minds with Boston-made
    theology.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;  and Kate Trenton wound her arms round her sister&rsquo;s
    waist, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, dear. Try and put this man out of your mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be such a little fool. Of course it&rsquo;s all finished
    long ago; but oh, Kit, I was sorry to see him go. He was so different from
    every other man I have ever met. Hosea disliked him intensely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite right, too,&rdquo; said Kate stoutly, &ldquo;how dared any
    man make love to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That is just what he did not do. He only came to the mission house
    occasionally and Hosea talked such dreadful twaddle to him in that hideously
    stupid, dull voice of his that he was glad to get away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What could such a man as he, Helen, have to talk about in common
    with your husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A good deal, Kit. He had a great deal of influence with the natives
    and Hosea was jealous and made no secret of it, Sometimes there would nearly
    be a quarrel,&rdquo;  and here she laughed, &ldquo;and I would enjoy it&mdash;anything
    was better than listening to Hosea&rsquo;s monotonous droning about the perversity
    of some chief or other who didn&rsquo;t want Christianity but did want square
    gin and axes and knives and muskets, and refused to cut down his harem to
    one. There, don&rsquo;t be shocked, dear, but just sit quietly and listen.
    It&rsquo;s such a relief for me to break out at last and let you see what
    a scandalous creature I am. But, oh, Kit, dear, just imagine what I have
    gone through for nearly six years. Night after night to sit in the front
    room of the mission house and listen to Hosea droning out his translations
    of the Scriptures to our native servants, then go to bed and wake up suddenly
    in the silence of the night and hear the droning of the surf&mdash;which
    was almost as bad as Hosea&rsquo;s&mdash; on the reef miles away. Sometimes
    I would get up and have a good cry and wish that I were dead. Perhaps if
    I had had a child to love, the life I lived would have been less horrible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Were there no other white men near you but that&mdash;that&mdash;man?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh yes, several. But none like him. There were three or four traders
    on the island, ignorant, rough men, but they never came near the mission,
    except on one occasion when one of them named Paddy Kerr called on behalf
    of his colleagues to tell Hosea that he was a meddlesome fool, and that if
    he or any of his native teachers &lsquo;came foolin&rsquo; around their way
    teachin&rsquo; natives that all white men, excep&rsquo; those that come in
    the <i>Morning Star</i>, missionary ship, was rogues,&rsquo; they (the traders)
    would duck Hosea in the lagoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The brutes,&rdquo; said Kate Trenton, indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not a bit of it my dear. There is a great deal to be said on both
    sides. We missionaries <i>are</i> a meddlesome lot, Kitty, and these English
    and American traders are <i>men</i>. Dreadful scamps, no doubt, many of them,
    but then they came here long before we did, and I don&rsquo;t think it right
    for us to prejudice the natives against them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen! How can you! I am afraid that this trading friend of yours
    has done you no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Parker laughed contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He has done me good, Kit&mdash;he and the rougher men he was associated
    with. I went to the islands a religious pedant, and my narrow-mindedness
    and silly bigotry received some severe shocks. There, dear, I won&rsquo;t
    shock you any more. Did you hear what Captain Bennett said to Hosea last
    night at supper about baptism by total immersion,&rdquo; and her eyes sparkled
    mischievously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, Helen, I hate the man and always get away from the table as quickly
    as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s very amusing. Hosea believes that
    total immersion is an all-important preliminary to future salvation, and
    asked Mr. Herrera&mdash;a Catholic, I suppose&mdash;  what his opinion was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Herrera say,&rdquo; asked Kate, showing interest enough
    now.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh nothing, merely bowed, said he didn&rsquo;t know, and asked Bennett
    if he intended bending on a new fore-topmast staysail. I suppose he wanted
    to get on deck after you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Helen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind, dear. Well, then Hosea asked Mr. Duggan, who only shook
    his head in agony and nearly choked himself with a piece of meat; then he
    asked Captain Bennett.</p>
  <p>&lsquo;Waal sir,&rsquo; said Bennett, &lsquo;may be yew air right and may
    be yew air wrong. Ez fur me, I was jest sprinkled in the ordinary way by
    old Parson Wicks, of Marblehead, an&rsquo; I reckon my old mother thought
    I had jest ez much chance of salvation ez if I&rsquo;d hev been anchored
    by the neck in the Mississippi fur a month.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>The younger woman smiled but then looked at her sister in surprise. She
    had never heard her talk like this before and never knew that her life had
    not been a happy one.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come on deck, Helen,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I hear them
    hauling the yards round and can feel the ship moving again. I am so glad.
    The language that man Bennett uses to the crew terrifies me and I will be
    glad when the voyage is over.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They went on deck, and as the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> heeled slightly to
    the breeze that came rippling over the water, the mate came up to them and,
    though he spoke to both, his eyes were for sweet-faced Kate Trenton alone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We have got the breeze at last ladies; by to-morrow morning we shall
    be in the Bay of Islands. Captain Bennett and Mr. Duggan have quarrelled
    again and we are going in there to try and get another officer in his place
    and some more men as well.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
    The First And Second Mates</b></h2>
  <p>Three months had passed; and the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> had crawled lazily
    along from the coast of New Zealand to the Friendly Islands, and then from
    the Friendlies northwards and westward towards the Carolines, till one morning
    she lay in sight of the little island group of L&#335;sap.</p>
  <p>The wind was light, so light that the old barque could scarce feel her helm
    as she rose and fell to the gentle ocean swell. The islands lay about three
    miles to windward&mdash;four small green spots of thickly clustering palms,
    encircled by a wide sweep of reef some ten or fifteen miles in circumference.
    On the north-east horn of the reef was the main island of the four, a thick
    mass of cocoanut trees and pandanus palms; and five miles away, at the extreme
    southern end, were the three smaller islets. These, too, were covered with
    vegetation &mdash;a dense and tangled fringe of low, light-green scrub, growing
    down to the beach; in the centre a few scattered clumps of cocoanuts, growing
    in twos and threes, lifted their stately plumes high above.</p>
  <p>Presently, John Barrington, who knew the place well, came aft, and after
    a turn or two along the deck, stopped and looked over toward the land.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lovely little spot, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he said, turning to Mrs.
    Hosea and her sister, who were sitting close together in two deckchairs.</p>
  <p>Kate Trenton smiled and nodded; she had grown to like Barrington; but her
    sister, save for a faint pink flush that came and vanished quickly, took
    no notice of his remark, and bent her face down over her book.</p>
  <p>Six weeks&rsquo; before, when she had met him first at the cabin table,
    her heart had leaped at the sight of him, only to die away within her when
    she found that, either designedly or from utter indifference, he scarcely
    spoke to her beyond the requirements of common courtesy. And from that evening
    to the present time he had seldom spoken to her directly. But that &lsquo;the
    little she-missionary,&rsquo; as he used mentally to call her, had ever&mdash;at
    any time &mdash;given him a thought, John Barrington never suspected, and
    while on the island in the olden days, he had never been nervous or embarrassed
    in her presence, he was so now, simply because he felt that both she and
    her sister were beings so immeasurably above him in their thoughts and life,
    that they could not but regard him with that feeling of antagonism natural
    to educated and refined women who come in contact with men of loose habits
    and South Sea morals generally, like himself. And no one knew better than
    he did his own failings. Had she come to him in his island home and preached
    to him on the evil of his ways, he would have given her a very sharp answer;
    but here, on board ship, it was a very different matter, and had she reproached
    him now about his past existence when he had lived near her and her husband
    at the mission station, he felt he would be utterly incapable of making any
    defence. Not that Mr. John Barrington was in the slightest degree ashamed
    of his manner of life as an Island trader, and indeed, he would express himself
    in very vigorous terms to the Reverend Hosea when that gentleman would make
    any allusion to the wickedness of white traders; but at the same time he
    was conscious that he could not use the same arguments to a young and pretty
    white lady as he could to her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are we going to send a boat ashore here, Mr. Barrington?&rdquo; asked
    Kate Trenton presently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I think so, Miss Trenton,&rdquo; he replied, and then, as the girl
    came over near him and placed her hand on the rail while she looked at the
    nearing land, he added in a lower voice and with a slight smile&mdash;</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page082"></a><br>
    <img src="2001271h-images/page082.jpg" width="525" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr. Parker wants Captain Bennett to let him go ashore and ascertain
    if the native chief will consent to a teacher landing here the next time
    the <i>Morning Star</i> missionary brig calls here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why do you laugh, Mr. Barrington. Is not my brother-in-law doing
    his duty to his conscience. I know you don&rsquo;t like him &mdash; neither
    does Mr. Herrera; but I am sure you must feel he is a good man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington was silent. He detested the jug-faced missionary most cordially,
    but wasn&rsquo;t going to say so to the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I was not laughing at his desire to go ashore, Miss Trenton; but
    because of Captain Bennett&rsquo;s remark when Mr. Parker asked him to lower
    a boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; said the girl with a bright smile, looking up
    into his face, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a horrible creature, but does say such amusing
    things. What did he say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington, shutting his left eye and scratching his cheek, imitated the
    captain&rsquo;s &ldquo;Down East&rdquo; drawl to perfection.</p>
  <p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Want to go ashore, hey? Waal, I don&rsquo;t mind,&rsquo; &nbsp;then,
    calling to the mate, &lsquo;Mr. Herrera, tell the third mate to get his boat
    ready. Mr. Parker wants to go ashore to indooce the natives to accept the
    Gawspil, and I want to buy some hogs.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kate smothered a laugh and turned away and just then Captain Bennett slouched
    up on deck, smoking, or rather chewing, his inevitable cigar. &ldquo;Howdy,
    ladies. Nice day, ain&rsquo;t it? Mr. Barrington, I&rsquo;m sendin&rsquo; two
    boats away&mdash;the third mate&rsquo;s and yours; and ez I believe that
    yew intend to stay here I&rsquo;ll feel obliged to yew if yew&rsquo;ll help
    Mr. Herrera to buy some hogs for the ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen Parker raised her face, and Kate saw that she was deathly pale. Neither
    of them knew that Barrington intended leaving the ship so soon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir. I think I can do that. I know the people pretty well.
    They are a rough lot, but I understand their ways.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He, he, he,&rdquo; sniggered Bennett, who was disposed to make himself
    pleasant to his officer, who only a week before had made fast to and killed
    the largest whale they had yet taken, &ldquo;he, he, he; so this is the island
    whar that nice young wife of yours ez livin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A quick glance at Kate Trenton and her sister showed Barrington that they
    had heard; they were both looking straight at him, wondering what his answer
    would be.</p>
  <p>The answer he made Bennett was given in such a low tone that neither of
    them caught more than the last words, which were &ldquo;and you mind your
    own &mdash;business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then with a black look on his face Barrington went on to the main deck to
    see to his boat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thet&rsquo;s a most ontractable young man,&rdquo; said Bennett to
    Hosea Parker who had now come up on deck in readiness to go ashore, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
    mighty techy about nothin&rsquo; &mdash; why, most everybody daown in these
    parts marries native wimmen. He ain&rsquo;t got no call to git so mad&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He will be called to account for it some day, my friend. It is terrible
    to think that men like him, engaged in such a dangerous avocation, and who
    may be cut off by the hand of Provi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Land alive, parson; yew do skeer me. I hope Providence ain&rsquo;t
    agoin&rsquo; to cut off any of my young men&mdash;an&rsquo; me with only
    two hundred and seventeen barrels of ile in the ship! Sech a possibility
    as thet jest gives me a cold chill daown the back,&rdquo; and the skipper
    of the <i>Passmore</i>, with a grin on his face, shambled away below again
    to get some trade goods together with which to buy the hogs he wanted. Hogs
    are not a pleasant subject; but hogs meant a great deal to Captain Amos Bennett,
    and indeed every body else on board the <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, for she was
    out of provisions.</p>
  <p>The original crew of the barque who had sailed with her from New Bedford,
    had deserted her either one by one or in batches at the various ports she
    had touched at, and when Bennett had put into the Bay of Island there was
    scarcely one of them remaining on board. Those who had been shipped in their
    places were either Chilenos or Portuguese&mdash;men whom it would not have
    been safe for Bennett to have knocked about as he did those who had run away.
    The use of foul language and reflections upon their parentage they accepted
    as a matter of course from the captain&mdash;especially if a whale was lost
    or a boat stove in &mdash; but a blow was quite another matter; and Bennett
    knew that as well as anyone on board, and regulated his conduct to them accordingly.
    And then, in the first mate, Joseph Herrera, many of them had, if not a countryman,
    one whom they regarded as such; and Amos Bennett knew too, that under that
    smooth-featured, effeminate-looking face there lurked the spirit of a tiger,
    and that although the mate was quick to come to his aid and uphold his authority
    when there was any trouble with the crew, that he was a dangerous man to
    insult or cross. Besides this, he was a good seaman and a splendid officer,
    and an able navigator&mdash;which Bennett was not. Therefore he valued him,
    but at the same time secretly despised him as a &ldquo;Dago,&rdquo; and took
    a malignant pleasure in always letting Hosea Parker know that Kate Trenton
    was on deck &ldquo;a-talking to that mate of mine,&rdquo; with the result
    that the pious Hosea would beckon her away and reprove her for wasting the
    officer&rsquo;s time. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6<br>
    Kate Trenton</b></h2>
  <p>And Herrera, although he did his duty with a smiling face and apparently
    took no notice of the daily mutterings of the crew about the bad food and
    the brutalities of the captain and the third and fourth mates only bided
    his time. He had, from the very day that Kate Trenton had come on board,
    fallen violently in love with her pink and white beauty, and as the voyage
    wore on had had plenty of opportunities of seeing her and talking to her
    alone. Long before the barque had let go the anchor in the Bay of Islands
    Amos Bennett noticed that a curious change had come over his chief mate,
    who always a reserved man, now seemed quieter than ever, and treated the
    wooden-faced Hosea Parker with such an affectation of respect that while
    it did not deceive Bennett, convinced the missionary that Joseph Herrera
    whom he at first considered a lost man&mdash; being a Papist&mdash;was about
    to be saved through his (Hosea&rsquo;s) instrumentality. And it suited the
    wily, handsome Bonin Island Portuguese to let him think so, for it gave him
    further chances to talk to the girl, and deepen in her the feeling of interest
    that he had aroused by his stories of the wild scenes and strange adventures
    he had passed through in his wanderings of twenty years in South Sea whalers.</p>
  <p>So it was no wonder that one evening as the old barque slid softly along
    under her shortened canvas, and the watch on deck lay about, looking up at
    the star-spangled heavens, and the warm breath of the trade wind fanned Kate
    Trenton&rsquo;s cheek that Herrera&rsquo;s chance came.</p>
  <p>She was just about to go below, and stopping for a moment at the companion
    way, held out her hand to the mate.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night, Mr. Herrera. I wish I could stay on deck. It is such
    a lovely night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>His brown, sinewy but shapely hand closed over hers and his black eyes glowed
    and shone with passionate ardour.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night&rdquo; he said, speaking in a voice scarce above a whisper,
    but still holding the girl&rsquo;s hand, and then he drew her unresistingly
    to him and kissed her on the lips.</p>
  <p>In another moment she had fled below and Jos&eacute; Herrera, with flashing
    eyes and his white teeth showing in a triumphant smile paced the deck and
    talked to himself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Holy Saints above! She is mine now. And to get her I am ready for
    anything&mdash;even to cutting the throat of the flat-faced Padre Parker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then as the ship rippled along over the star-lit sea he made up his
    plan of action. She could not leave her sister, he knew&mdash;at least not
    for a couple of years, and in a couple of years a great deal might happen &mdash; she
    might meet another man.</p>
  <p>From that evening Jos&eacute; Herrera began to ingratiate himself with some
    of the crew. He did not mean to resort to violence to attain the object he
    had in view if it could be managed quietly; if it could not&mdash;well, so
    much the worse for those who might oppose him. He simply meant to run away
    from the ship in one of her boats and take Kate Trenton away with him to
    his native land&mdash;the Bonin Islands. But to do this he would need the
    assistance of some of the crew. In a day or so more the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> would
    be at an island where he meant to put his plan into execution. And so, never
    doubting for a moment his power over Kate Trenton, he went about his work
    quite satisfied that the girl would come away with him when the time came.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We are sure to call off Truk,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and it will
    be easy enough to get away in my boat to one of the islands in Truk lagoon
    and hide there till the ship goes off without us. I don&rsquo;t think Amos
    Bennett would care to come and look for me and four other armed men&mdash;all
    of whom would willingly cut his lean throat rather than be taken back to
    the ship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Just as Amos Bennett went into his cabin to pick out some trade goods to
    send ashore in the boats, Mrs. Parker opened her cabin door and came out,
    followed by Kate Trenton and the Reverend Hosea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Captain Bennett, my sister and I would like to go ashore with Mr.
    Parker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, ladies, ef I was yew I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the captain,
    who was busily engaged in digging out cakes of tobacco from a small case
    with his pocket-knife, &ldquo;these here Loosap natives don&rsquo;t cotton
    much to strangers and ef anything onpleasant occurred, why, I should feel
    myself to blame fur lettin&rsquo; yew go in the boats. Yew see, ladies, these
    Loosap people air a very excitable lot, an&rsquo; the least thing might make
    an onpleasantness between them and my boats&rsquo; crews.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Hosea, don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; said Kate Trenton, &ldquo;Mr. Barrington,
    too, was telling me this morning that, unlike most of the Caroline Islanders,
    these natives do not care for visits from strangers, and that when he lived
    here some years ago the whale-ships that called for fresh provisions had
    great trouble in inducing the natives to sell them anything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The Reverend Hosea, however, was not alarmed. Already he could see in the
    Society&rsquo;s magazine an account stating how &ldquo;the Reverend Hosea
    Parker, the earnest and intrepid missionary, had planted the seed at L&#335;sap,&rdquo; and,
    indeed, the honest man had any amount of a stupid, tactless courage.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is my duty, Kate, and, besides that, I have long wished to see
    these people and give them the Light. This is the island, too, that that
    unfortunate girl N&#257;dee belongs too; perchance she may be here now, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s mouth hardened suddenly at the mention of the name of
    Barrington&rsquo;s native wife, and she interrupted her husband.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am determined to go ashore. Both Kate and I would go mad, cooped
    up on board. If it is only to put my foot on the beach for a moment, and
    then be capsized in the boat coming out, I would go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, jest as yew please, ladies. If Mr. Parker is willin&rsquo; I
    won&rsquo;t object. Oh, is that you, Mr. Barrington? Here&rsquo;s the terbacker
    and other things. These here ladies are a goin&rsquo; ashore with yew an&rsquo; Parson
    Parker.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington&rsquo;s face showed annoyance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is a bad landing place, Mrs. Parker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;What
    the devil did the women want to come for?&rdquo; he thought.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; she answered, coolly. &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll take
    all risks. You don&rsquo;t look very pleased, Mr. Barrington, at having our
    company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There was a sarcastic ring in the laugh that ended her speech and Barrington
    was nettled and showed it. He was not pleased at the prospect, for two reasons;
    the first was that the women might get drenched going over the reef; the
    second was that he did not want them to witness his meeting with his native
    wife.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Just as you please, Mrs. Parker; but in addition to the chances of
    us getting a wetting in going ashore and in coming out loaded up with turtle
    and pigs, I don&rsquo;t think you will like the people; they are very reserved
    and suspicious of strangers, and the women always retire till they are gone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh what a shame,&rdquo; said Miss Trenton, puckering up her dark
    eyebrows, &ldquo;and I so wanted to see them; I am told that they are very
    handsome. Are they, Mr. Barrington?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Barrington felt somewhat ashamed. Kate Trenton&rsquo;s innocent eyes, the
    reflex of her pure and innocent mind, always did make him feel ashamed when
    by any chance the talk turned upon native women. He thought that her sister
    disliked him strongly and had given her a pretty bad account of him; else
    why did she so pointedly avoid speaking to him when they met on deck. So,
    with something like a woman&rsquo;s blush, he answered &ldquo;Some of them
    are very handsome, Miss Trenton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But few so handsome as N&#257;dee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The second mate turned sharply and looked at the missionary&rsquo;s wife.
    She was sitting in the captain&rsquo;s chair, leaning her cheek upon one
    hand. There was a curious, defiant glitter in her eyes as she met his glance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;D&mdash;n her&rdquo; he said under his breath. &ldquo;She wants to
    show me up again before her sister. Why the &mdash; can&rsquo;t she leave
    me alone,&rdquo; then a quick feeling of anger came over him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As you say, Mrs. Parker, few are so handsome as N&#257;dee; and few
    or none are as good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The colour died away on Mrs. Parker&rsquo;s face and then with a little,
    sneering laugh she rose and went into her cabin.</p>
  <p>Something made Kate Trenton lift her honest brown eyes to Barrington&rsquo;s,
    and then she impulsively held out her hand to him. He took it quickly, pressed
    it, and then raising his hat to her, went up on deck.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear little woman &rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I do believe
    she&rsquo;d meet N&#257;dee and&mdash;and&mdash; not think she was such a
    terribly bad lot after all.&rdquo; By God if Herrera tries to harm her I&rsquo;ll
    spoil his beauty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>In the Reverend Hosea&rsquo;s cabin his wife was savagely drying her eyes
    with her handkerchief when Kate entered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are you ready, Helen?&rdquo; she began, and then she stopped and
    tears of sympathy filled her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen, dear. We will not go. You look quite ill. What is the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo;  she answered brusquely, &ldquo;only that I&rsquo;m
    a fool and only knew it thoroughly just now. Let us go by all means. I don&rsquo;t
    care a fig about the heathen, but I do want to go ashore, out of this miserable,
    stuffy cabin and get a walk on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The black beard and dark handsome face of the mate appeared over the skylight.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The boats are ready, ladies, Mr. Parker is getting quite impatient.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come Helen,&rdquo; her sister said in a whisper, &ldquo;you will
    feel better soon.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
    N&#257;dee</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a whale-ship, my mother, for when she lifts to the swell
    of the ocean I can see her many boats hoisted up high over her side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>N&#257;dee, standing out in front of the russet-thatched high-peaked house
    in the native village, leans her lithe young figure against the bole of a
    cocoanut tree, and shading her eyes against the glare of the morning sun
    with her little brown hands, looks steadily once more out eastward over the
    sea towards the ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come thou inside, child,&rdquo; answered a voice tremulous with age, &ldquo;who
    but thee, O one with little thought, would stand out there in the blazing
    sun to look at a ship. What hath the ship to do with thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl laughed joyously at the question of old Tariva, whom she called
    mother, but who was really her grandmother and the only one of her blood
    alive; then she answered, still shading her eyes as she watched the ship.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It may be mother, that my husband cometh. Who can tell? And twenty
    and five <i>mahins</i>&nbsp;  (Months) have come and gone since he left us,
    and he said that he would come again in twenty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Foolish child! And does it take thee five moons to learn that he
    is a liar and thou a fool?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s head drooped, her cloud of wavy hair fell around her face
    and she worked one of her bared feet slowly to and fro in the heated sand
    and broken coral pebble on which she stood. For a minute or so she made no
    answer, and then slowly walked towards the house, passed the opened door
    of thatch, and disappeared.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>Within, an old woman with wrinkled face and snow-white hair falling in ragged
    tails down her brown and naked back was seated cross-legged before a tiny
    fire of charcoal. With one hand she fanned the coals and with the other stirred
    some liquid that bubbled and frothed in a halved cocoanut shell set in among
    the embers.</p>
  <p>Softly but steadily the old grandam flapped the broad fan she held in her
    hand and peered anxiously into the shell and as she fanned she muttered and
    crooned to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did I not tell her so . . . J&#257;ki (Jack) is but as other white
    men. And the twenty <i>mahin</i> have passed and gone, and five more . .
    . Guk! the girl is a fool. He hath wearied of her and will return not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She lifted out the shell, and set it beside her, for the heat had now began
    to crack and warp it; then talking up another one from a number that lay
    beside her, she set it among the coals and poured back into it the liquid
    from the charred shell.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, they be all alike those white men . . . ah, it boileth again
    . . . N&#257;dee, come thou and see to it. Thy eyes are better than mine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer came from the girl, who, though the old dame knew it not, was
    seated with her back to the cane-latticed side of the house, not ten feet
    away, crying softly to herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&#257;dee,&rdquo;  again called old Tariva querously, &ldquo;hast
    not yet tired of baking thyself in the fierce sun, looking at the ship. Come,
    child, and see the oil I have made and scented with <i>nudu</i> flowers and
    sandalwood. Dost think &rsquo;tis for my old white locks I make it, thou
    lazy N&#257;dee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sob answered her, &ldquo;Nay, mother. But set it aside for a little time;
    for my eyes are dimmed with the glare of the sun, and I fear the smoke of
    thy fire. And here, in the shade, it is cool for me to sit awhile.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman&rsquo;s lined and wrinkled face softened, and she glanced
    towards the side of the house from whence N&#257;dee spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou liest, child. &rsquo;Tis not the sun that hath hurt thy eyes;
    &rsquo;tis the foolish tears for the man who cast thee off.&quot;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say not that, my mother,&rdquo; and the girl&rsquo;s voice, soft
    and low as it sounded, trembled as she caught her breath, &ldquo;for though &rsquo;tis
    so long since, not one ship have we seen at L&#335;sap since he sailed. And
    it may be this one .... for why should he cast me off, as thou sayest? &rsquo;&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  The old woman laughed scornfully, &ldquo;because of
    the wife of the Christ-man at Ponap&eacute;; the woman with the hair like
    the yellow of the setting sun; dost think thy beauty can compare with that
    of the Christ-woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl sprang to her feet, and in another moment she stood in the open
    doorway, with her hands clenched.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a lie, old Tariva! Thou art old and foolish. The wife
    of the Christ-man was nought to my white man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman&rsquo;s thin lips parted in a contemptuous smile, and her
    white teeth showed. Still fanning the embers with one hand she looked keenly
    at N&#257;dee&rsquo;s working face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why was it, then, that after the Christ-man and his wife came to
    Ponap&eacute;, that he went away from thee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s hands unclenched and a troubled look came into her face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He was wearied, he said, of the dull days, and longed to go out upon
    the ocean again in one of the ships that seek for whales. For that is the
    work that he hath done from his boyhood. And how could he take me with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Tah!</i> lies, lies, all lies. Are there not many white men in
    these islands whose wives voyage to and fro with them in ships? Did not Siria,
    the daughter of Larik, and Nili, mine own sister&rsquo;s child&mdash;she
    who is now dead&mdash;sail with their white husbands to the far off islands
    of the south?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;True, mother,&rdquo; said N&#257;dee steadfastly, &ldquo;but, see,
    those were trading ships. But never a woman goeth away beyond the sea-rim
    in a whale-ship. And did my husband ever tell thee lies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;O foolish child, to so believe in one of strange blood. If he so
    cared for thee, why did he weary of thee so soon? I tell thee it was because
    of the Christ-woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not so. It was because that he was poor and had but little goods
    wherewith to buy oil and pearl shell and tortoise shell, as did the other
    white men on Ponap&eacute;. And so, because that the days were dull to him
    he told me he desired to sail for two years in a whale-ship, so that he would
    get money in plenty; and then would he return with all the things he desired
    and live with me always. But the beautiful Christ-woman had naught to do
    with his going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The old woman lifted the shell she was tending from off the fire, and brushing
    off the dust from the mat on which she sat, motioned to the girl to sit beside
    her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come hither, little one and sit by old Tariva&mdash;thy mother&rsquo;s
    mother, the only one that is left to thee of all thy people.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Still with the troubled look in her lustrous eyes, N&#257;dee, with another
    glance seaward at the white sails of the ship, stepped inside, and sat down
    beside the old woman, who, drawing the girlish figure to her wrinkled old
    bosom, pressed her lips to hers&rsquo; in a silent, loving embrace.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only thou art left to me, little one; thou of all that were once
    so many; and because that I am so old and will soon be with the silent ones,
    (The dead)&nbsp; and thou wilt be alone, do I wish to tell thee of some things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl&rsquo;s rounded arm encircled the old dame&rsquo;s skinny neck
    and her little hand stroked her white locks, the while she laid her cheek,
    so young and full and tender against her grandam&rsquo;s lined and furrowed
    brow.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
    One Of The Old Bottles</b></h2>
  <p>There was none to hear them talk, for, save the old woman and the girl,
    the rest of the few people in the little village were away at work in their
    plantations or out fishing in the lagoon. Outside, the quiet of the palm
    grove was scarce broken even by the rustling of the breeze that swayed their
    branches to and fro. Sometimes, on the white blaze of shimmering beach that
    came to within a few fathoms of the open door of old Tariva&rsquo;s house,
    a swift black shadow would sweep by as some frigate bird would skim past,
    flying low down over the beach ere he took his mounting flight seaward to
    plunge with deadly aim and cruel beak into the blue depths of ocean beyond
    the barrier reef.</p>
  <p>So, in silence, and still caressing the aged face, N&#257;dee waited till
    the time-worn old Tariva chose to speak; but, even as she waited her eyes
    wandered out seawards again and again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Turn thy back to the sea, little one. Let not the ship trouble thy
    mind yet awhile. When I have said all that which is within me, then, if thou
    carest to still look across the sea-rim for him who will never come, so be
    it and I will have nought more to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl faced round with a strange, wondering look in the depths of her
    great soft eyes. What was it old Tariva had to say? Thrice since the day
    that they had returned to L&#335;sap to await the coming back of her white
    husband, had her grandam spoken to her of Railik, the son of the chief of
    L&#335;sap, who desired her for his wife, and each time had N&#257;dee, covering
    her face with her hands shook her head and said, &ldquo;I will wait. The
    twenty months must first be passed and gone ere I will talk of such things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And although old Tariva had given her some bitter words for her folly, yet
    she had not sought to force the girl&rsquo;s choice. Railik, fierce and turbulent
    as he was, dared not seize her and carry her off; for old Tariva was <i>ejon</i>,
    a strong witch, and had power to cause his limbs to wither and perish so
    that the skin would cleave to the bone and make him ugly to look upon in
    the eyes of all men if he tried to win the girl by force against her grandam&rsquo;s
    wish.</p>
  <p>But yet&mdash;and N&#257;dee, the white man&rsquo;s wife knew it well&mdash;old
    Tariva favoured his suit, and though since that third time she spoke not
    again of the lying, faithless white men to her, she was for ever talking
    of the skill and cleverness in all things of Railik, he whom, of all the
    young men on L&#335;sap was worthy by his father&rsquo;s name to have a wife
    in whose veins ran blood as good as his own.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>A minute had passed and yet the old woman had not spoken. She had placed
    her bony claw-like hands upon the girl&rsquo;s smooth and rounded shoulders
    and her keen old eyes were bent upon N&#257;dee&rsquo;s in a strange, wild
    look that filled her young heart with fear.</p>
  <p>Presently there came to them a sound, as of the strong voices of men, made
    faint by distance. &ldquo;Heed it not, my N&#257;dee,&rdquo; said old Tariva
    in a low, mechanical voice, her eyes still fixed upon the girl&rsquo;s face, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis
    but the men of L&#335;sap who only now see the sails of the ship.&rdquo; Breathing
    so that her bared bosom rose and fell in quick, panting strokes and with
    eyes filled with terror, N&#257;dee spoke in a voice like a whisper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is it, O my mother, that maketh thee look so strangely upon
    me; thy eyes are as two moons shining through the blackness of the darkest
    night, and fill me with fear. Have I done aught wrong, and art thou about
    to cast <i>ejon</i> (Witchcraft) over me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>As she faintly whispered the last words her eyes grew dim, misty and slumberous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;N&#257;dee!&rdquo;  and the quavering tones of Tariva&rsquo;s voice
    became strong and harsh as the call of the frigate bird, &ldquo;wake, child!
    There, see, my beloved; look now into old Tariva&rsquo;s eyes; only do I
    cast <i>ejon</i> on those whom I hate,&rdquo; and she took her hands from
    N&#257;dee&rsquo;s trembling shoulders;  &ldquo;but listen well to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, my mother; but look not again with thy eyes into mine, for then
    my soul goeth out into darkness, and though I hear thy voice my heart and
    tongue sleep.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A faint smile crossed the thin, old lips, and patting the girl&rsquo;s knee,
    she said in soft, purring tones,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fear not, my little one. Strong am I to cast spells for good and
    evil over men and women; only against the <i>rebelli</i> (white people) am
    I powerless. And it is because that my <i>ejon</i> is of no avail against
    the white man that I now sit here and plead for thee to lay well to thy mind
    that which thou must know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;  and N&#257;dee bent her head low down upon the old
    dame&rsquo;s lap, &ldquo;would&rsquo;st use <i>ejon</i> to harm my white
    husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, child. For though I hate the <i>rebelli</i>, whether they be
    ship-men or Christ-men, yet would I bring thy husband back to thee, child
    of my child and last of my race, ere I go out to the spirit land.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why hate ye the white men, mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A savage light leapt into the old woman&rsquo;s eyes and her white, even
    teeth snapped together like the jaws of a shark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hate them! Aye, that do I. Would that I could live to see them wither
    and perish and be swept away as we of the sea-girt lands have withered and
    perished before them. Long, long ago, when my hair was as black, and my bosom
    as full and round as thine, my people were a great people, for, as thou knowest,
    my father was a great man on Ponap&eacute;, and the land he ruled stretched
    from Jakoits on the north to Metalanien near unto the strange stone houses
    that were built by the unknown men. (The mysterious and ancient ruins on
    Ponap&eacute;, in the Caroline Islands.)&nbsp; He it was who sailed in two
    great canoes to this little island of L&#335;sap, a twenty days&rsquo; journey,
    and slew half the men and would have slain all but that his eyes were taken
    with the beauty of my mother, who, as she fled along this beach now before
    us, fell, and would have been thrust through, only that my father beat back
    the bloodied hands of those who pursued her. And so because she pleased him
    he spared the lives of all those men of L&#335;sap who still lived, and took
    her to wife. Ah! those were the days when we were strong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell me more my mother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, child,&rdquo; answered Tariva, who was speaking of those olden
    days with a set purpose, and noting how eagerly N&#257;dee listened, &ldquo;those
    were days when the quick, hot blood of youth ran lusty and strong in my father&rsquo;s
    veins, and save for the two or three white sailors who dwelt under the protection
    of T&rsquo;Nanakin, the king of Jakoits, we of Ponap&eacute; knew naught
    of the <i>rebelli</i>. Brave men, though, were <i>those</i> white men, for
    sometimes when a ship lay becalmed they led our people out in the dead of
    night and slew all on board, and returned to the shore laden with riches.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl shuddered as she caught the fiery gleam and sparkle in old Tariva&rsquo;s
    sunken eyes, but yet listened intently, leaning her chin upon the palm of
    one hand.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And then the days and months and years went by till there came to
    Metalanien the first of the Christ-men, in a white-painted ship. Well would
    it have been had my father and T&rsquo;Nanakin, the king of Jakoits, did
    unto this ship as they had done unto others, but the <i>ejon</i> of the Christ-man
    was too strong, and he fooled my father and T&rsquo;Nanakin both with his
    cunning words.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How so, my mother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In this way, child. All men love to hear of that which is strange
    and new; and this Christ-man told my father cunning lies of a man-god who
    was greater than all the gods of Ponap&eacute; and who had sent him&mdash;the
    cunning Christ-man&mdash;to Ponap&eacute; to tell my father to forswear the
    old gods and follow the god of the Christ-man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, mother, my husband hath spoken to me of this Christ-God.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What said he, N&#257;dee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But little, mother. &rsquo;Twas long ago, when the beautiful Christ-woman&mdash;the
    wife of the Christ-man, whom my husband called a meddling fool&mdash;came
    to our house with her husband and talked with my white man. Something they
    said to him of myself and the wrath of the Christ-God it was that angered
    him, and though he spoke softly because of the yellow-haired woman, who sat
    by me with her hand clasped around mine, yet was he hot with anger against
    the mean looking man who said the Christ had sent him to save me from perishing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Go&rsquo;  he said, speaking in the tongue of the white men, &lsquo;thou
    to thy trade, and leave me to mine. Come not here to me in mine own house
    and seek to poison the heart of my wife against me. She is to me my wife
    by the custom of the land, and I want no man such as thee to come between
    us.&rsquo; And then the woman rose and bade me farewell and said to the Christ-man
    her husband, &lsquo;Leave them. Why should we seek to make trouble between
    then?&rsquo; So though they came again to my husband&rsquo;s house the woman&rsquo;s
    husband spoke no more to mine of the Christ-god and the lake of fire into
    which He casts his enemies,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ahe!&rdquo;  Resumed the old woman, &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas that, the
    great sea of fire which is in the bowels of the earth, that made the heart
    of T&rsquo;Nanakin turn white, and he became eaten up with the <i>ejon</i> of
    the Christ-god. And day by day the power of the head Christ-man on the Christ-ship
    grew stronger and stronger. One day it came about that T&rsquo;Nanakin and
    my father and other chiefs went to visit the ship, and the next day two of
    them were seized with an illness from which many of the ship men had died.
    T&rsquo;Nanakin, who loved these men, went to the Christ-wizard and besought
    him to save his men. And, see, my child, how silly are some men and how clever
    others: for this wizard soon put terror in the heart of T&rsquo;Nanakin,
    and said&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If these men die it is the will of the Great Christ-God, who
    hath sent me to tell thee to cast away thy gods of wood and worship him.
    Beware, O chief, and delay not, lest something terrible befall thee, and
    the lake of fire swallow up thee and thy people.&rsquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The two men died, and then in every house in every village some one
    was seized by the strange illness from the Christ-ship, and many hundreds
    died. And then T&rsquo;Nanakin with his chiefs humbled himself to the Christ-wizard,
    and said, &lsquo;Thy gods are greater than mine. Let this sickness go away
    from my people and I will do as thou wishest&mdash;I will be a Christ-man.&rsquo; Then
    the white wizard and three other wizards who were with him rejoiced greatly
    and made much of T&rsquo;Nanakin and gave him many presents and clothed him
    with new black garments. In two days all of his people swore faith to the
    Christ-god; but my father and his people did not, for they had heard of the
    sickness and no one of them would go near the white men. Then T&rsquo;Nanakin,
    who had cast away his father&rsquo;s gods for the new <i>ejon</i>, sent word
    down saying, &lsquo;Come up and be a Christ-man, or thou and thy people will
    be seized with a deadly illness and die, and be cast into a lake of red fire,
    where they shall yet live again for ever.&rsquo; But my father would not
    go.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So T&rsquo;Nanakin and my father quarrelled, and one night, when
    all in our village lay asleep, the canoes of T&rsquo;Nanakin crept down and
    killed all that would not be slaves to him and the white wizard, and then,
    we who were conquered, knew that the <i>ejon</i> of the white man&rsquo;s
    god was greater than that of ours.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For two moons T&rsquo;Nanakin&rsquo;s men sought out and slew all
    those opposed to the new faith, and no smoke arose in our country save that
    which came from the burning houses of my father&rsquo;s people; for we fled
    to the woods&mdash;all that were left of us  &mdash; and lived in hiding.
    Then came the time when many died of hunger and Kanka my father and all the
    men who were with him died under the knives of T&rsquo;Nanakin&rsquo;s men,
    who had found out our refuge. And then my mother, taking me with her, fled
    with some few other women and children, of whom I was one, to the island
    called P&#257;kin, close to the mainland; and there we lived till I was taken
    to wife by a man of P&#257;kin. Then, when my mother died, she told me to
    take thee&mdash;thou wert then but six spans of the hand in height&mdash;to
    this land of L&#335;sap, where we would be well cared for by those of her
    blood. But how could I leave my husband and seek my mother&rsquo;s land out
    over the great ocean? So I lived on at P&#257;kin, till my husband died,
    and thou wert a grown girl. Then came this white husband of thine who took
    us both to live with him at Ponap&eacute;. And I know he will never come
    back to thee; so wait no longer my child, but take Railik for thy husband.
    He is a clever man and hates the white men as much as I hate them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The girl covered her eyes with her hands but said not a word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, child, there is yet another thing. Thou sayest that the fair-faced,
    white woman, the wife of the dull-eyed Christ-man, is nought to thy husband.
    Now I, that am very old, know many things, because of the <i>ejon</i> I have
    learnt; and I tell thee, foolish one, that if she be nought to him, he was
    much to her. And it was because she looked at him with her eyes like the
    blue sea, and made him ashamed of thee, that he wearied of thee and went
    away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>N&#257;dee bent her head still lower and then wept silently,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay weep not, little one,&rdquo; went on old Tariva mercilessly, &ldquo;what
    does it matter. Thou hast no child for men to point at and jeer and say &lsquo;see,
    the child of the man who fooled its mother.&rsquo; And yet, it is hard for
    one so young and handsome as thee to be cast aside for another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, mother. He may not come back to me; but not because of another
    woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou fool. Didst thou not see that in less than a year after he had
    gone that the white wizard woman sickened and pined for him, and then followed
    him to his own country in the white-painted wizard ship. Is it not true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo;  said N&#257;dee in a whisper, &ldquo;she took her
    husband with her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Old Tariva laughed contemptuously: &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas but a trick. She cares
    not for her husband, and I have seen her turn her face from him when he spoke
    to her. &rsquo;Tis thy white man she loves. Now listen, child, to me. I tell
    thee that by this time she hath killed the gloomy-faced Christ-wizard and
    is wife to thy white man in her own land. He did but fool thee when he spoke
    of coming back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She ceased and looked at the bowed figure of N&#257;dee, who had buried
    her face in the old dame&rsquo;s lap and was sobbing&nbsp;  convulsively.</p>
  <p>Tariva, muttering to herself, stroked the black waves of hair tenderly and
    waited. She had won, and N&#257;dee&mdash;the child of her heart&mdash;would
    forget this false white man and marry Railik, and then she, old Tariva, would
    have given to her all that land on L&#333;sap which was hers of right, for
    had it not belonged to her mother in the olden days.</p>
  <p>Suddenly the sobs ceased and N&#257;dee rose to her feet and went to the
    door. For a moment or two she looked out over the blue expanse of ocean that
    lay before her tear-dimmed eyes; but the ship had gone, she had passed round
    the south horn of the reef and was hidden from view for the time.</p>
  <p>Then, with a smile struggling through her tears, N&#257;dee turned and spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It shall be as thou wishest, my mother. I am indeed a fool. When
    it pleases thee, take me to Railik&rsquo;s house.&rdquo; Then she stepped
    out and with a choking sob threw herself down on the grassy plot at the back
    of old Tariva&rsquo;s house, and lay there silent with her face in her hands. </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
    In The Boil Of The Surf</b></h2>
  <p>When within a mile or so of the principal village on the main island, the <i>Kellet
      Passmore</i> backed her main-yard and the two boats pushed off from her
      side, the lantern-jawed skipper calling out to Herrera to get back as quickly
      as possible as the wind showed signs of dying away and he was suspicious
      of an easterly gale coming down and catching him in such an awkward place.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a darned big swell rollin&rsquo; in too, naow,&rdquo; he
    added, &ldquo;an&rsquo; I aint too dreadful anxious to keep foolin&rsquo; around
    here with sich a current settin&rsquo; us inshore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In Herrera&rsquo;s boat were the two ladies, the stolid-faced Hosea and
    the usual crew; in Barrington&rsquo;s himself and crew only, and a box containing
    the trade goods for barter with the natives.</p>
  <p>For some ten or twenty minutes or so the boats pulled side by side until
    they got within a few hundred yards of the reef, then Barrington&rsquo;s
    drew ahead. There was not much of a sea on, but the passage through the break
    in the reef was very narrow, and as Barrington knew the place well his boat
    was to go first.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Look, Miss Trenton,&rdquo; said the mate, pointing to the white line
    of beach in front of them, &ldquo;take your first view of a South Sea Island
    village; and see the natives swarming down to the beach to meet us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Kate, with her eyes dancing with excitement, answered him with a bright
    smile and then gave a little scream,</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh, Helen, look at Mr. Barrington&rsquo;s boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The second mate&rsquo;s boat had just swept over the reef, bow down in front
    of a roller, and in the midst of a seeth of white foam, and wild cries from
    the swarm of natives on the beach, she landed right in their midst. Herrera,
    with a quick look astern waited for another sea to come, determined to go
    in on top of it, instead of waiting for a lull and pulling in quietly. He
    saw that there was a clean run in once he got over the edge of the reef,
    and he wanted to show Kate Trenton that Barrington was not the only man who
    could take a boat in over the reef on top of a sea.</p>
  <p>At a sign from Herrera the crew shipped the oars and took out broad-bladed
    native paddles&mdash;Barrington&rsquo;s boat had gone in with oars apeak&mdash;and
    waited for the word.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Give it to her, boys!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The five paddles struck into the water and the light boat sprang forward
    in front of the advancing sea. In another ten seconds, with the two women
    and Hosea holding tightly to each other in terrified silence and Herrera
    straining at the steer-oar, she was darting like an arrow through the water,
    in front of the boiling, hissing surf.</p>
  <p>Suddenly amidst the wild rush and bubble of the snow-white spume that frothed
    past the gunwales with lightning speed, Herrera uttered a savage oath; right
    ahead of him lay a round knob of coral, just showing its pink and blue top
    above the surface of the water. With a fierce strain at the steer-oar he
    just shaved past it, but in another moment the boat broached-to and rolled
    over and filled.</p>
  <p>Before a canoe could be launched, Barrington, with a curse upon the mate&rsquo;s
    vain folly, had sprung back into his boat and was pulling out to save them.
    Already, though, the sweeping back-wash had carried boat and people out towards
    the edge of the reef again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pull, you sons of devils, pull,&rdquo; said Barrington to his crew,
    as another sea came hurtling in with curling top, &ldquo;the women will be
    drowned!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>But that sea nearly half-filled his boat, and by the time they got way on
    her again the capsized boat had been swept down by the current right into
    the thundering surf that broke on the reef on each side of the narrow passage.</p>
  <p>Fifty yards away Barrington saw two of Herrera&rsquo;s crew and the Reverend
    Hosea, who was supported by them, swimming down with the current towards
    shallower water, and further out, in the blue rollers, he saw the black head
    of Herrera, keeping himself afloat, and holding up Kate Trenton, and then
    almost at the same moment that he caught sight of the white face of the missionary&rsquo;s
    wife clinging despairingly to a jagged mass of coral not five fathoms away,
    another roaring sea leapt down upon his half-filled boat and fairly smothered
    her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two of you to the mate, boys,&rdquo; he called to the Maori crew, &ldquo;the
    rest of you stick to the boat, and then he struck out towards the drowning
    woman, who with the strength of despair still clung to the coral boulder,
    which was about two or three feet out of the water, and saved her from being
    smothered by the seas which rolled by on either side.</p>
  <p>Just as he reached her a roller, higher and swifter than the others, tore
    away her weakening grasp, and holding her in his arms they were buried beneath;
    when they came to the surface he saw that she was still alive but nearly
    unconscious.</p>
  <p>For nearly five minutes Barrington, with the blood welling from a fearful
    cut on his head, drifted seaward with the woman. He knew the canoes would
    be along presently, for already, although strange noises filled his brain
    from the blow he had received and the blood blinded his eyesight, he could
    hear the cries of the natives close to.</p>
  <p>He had twined his hand into the woman&rsquo;s hair and held her in front
    of him with his left hand. Then as he still partly drifted, partly swam seaward,
    away out from the sweep of the seas&mdash;for they were now out over the
    reef&mdash;with dulled brain and blood-filled eyes a thought ran through
    him that smote his heart with a deadly chill. He knew he was bleeding badly
    and knew that the sharks are quick to answer to the smell of blood.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God help us,&rdquo; he muttered thickly, &ldquo;what can I do?&rdquo; Then
    his senses left him.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>Away out on the <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, Captain Amos Bennett from the fore-topsail
    yard had seen Herrera&rsquo;s boat broach-to and fill, had seen Barrington&rsquo;s
    meet with a like fate, and had cursed all missionaries unto the tenth generation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Waal, I&rsquo;ll be goldarned! Two boats capsized and ez like ez
    not stove-in,&rdquo; and he threw his cigar down on to the deck for&rsquo;ard with
    another curse after it, &ldquo;and perhaps some of my men injoored.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope the women and the parson ain&rsquo;t hurt,&rdquo; said the fourth
    mate, who had just come up aloft and stood beside him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Darned ef I care; their passages are paid,&rdquo; was the snorting
    reply, for the worthy Bennett&mdash;although he didn&rsquo;t mean what he
    said, was in a very bad temper.</p>
  <p>And, just then, as he gave orders for another boat to be lowered, the breeze
    died away so suddenly and suspiciously that he hurried down below to look
    at the glass. He was back on deck in a minute.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never mind the boat, Mr. Briggs. There&rsquo;s plenty canoes to pick
    up the darned fools, and there&rsquo;s going to be h&mdash;l to pay in another
    five minutes here. Stand-by the braces, and look spry we don&rsquo;t get
    caught aback. Darn all parsons I say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In another ten minutes the first puffs of the coming easterly struck the
    old barque. She heeled over to it, and then as the whistle of it passed away
    stood up again on an even keel; but only for a few seconds, as the short,
    savage puffs settled down into the droning hum of a heavy squall.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Two hours later, under close reefed fore and maintopsails she was running
    before it, with a sea like mountains chasing her and banging against her
    old, square stern and wall-sides.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guess we won&rsquo;t heave her to among these reefs between Loosap
    and Urville&rsquo;s Island, Mr. Briggs. Let her go as she is an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll
    get under the lee of Truk, until this darned easterly blows its guts out.
    Then I reckon we&rsquo;ll hev to come back and pick up Mr. Herrera an&rsquo; Mr.
    Barrington and them Gawspil folks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And so, with the drone of the easterly singing through her cordage and the
    swash of the mountain seas swirling up against her weather-beaten sides the
    old whaler plunges and splashes westward, running dead before it, and is
    lost to sight and no more heard of in this story.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
    Under The Palms</b></h2>
  <p>A swarm of brown, half-naked men and women rushed to the beach to meet the
    returning canoes, and as they stood and waited a savage, roaring gust swept
    through the dense palm-grove at their backs and whipped up great clouds of
    the white, clinking sand, and carried it far out seawards.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haste, haste, my children!&rdquo; and Sru, the chief of L&#335;sap,
    a great, broad-shouldered native, naked save for his thick girdle of banana
    fibre, sprang into the water and looked anxiously at the three canoes as
    they sped shoreward in face of the rising storm.</p>
  <p>A wild cry went up from the assembled people as the first one swept in through
    the boiling surf and ran her sharp bows upon the beach and the wet and naked
    rowers sprang out; and Herrera, holding Kate Trenton in his arms, was seen
    seated amidships with two of Barrington&rsquo;s boat&rsquo;s crew.</p>
  <p>Too exhausted to speak he motioned to the women to take her, and then staggering
    on his feet like a drunken man he sought to discover something of Barrington
    and the others, but a blinding, stinging rain-squall had obscured the two
    other canoes from view, and then he was half-carried away by some natives
    to the shelter of the chief&rsquo;s house, where the women had already taken
    Kate Trenton, and with kindly hands and pitying words were bringing her back
    to life again.</p>
  <p>In the second canoe were two of Herrera&rsquo;s crew, for their boat had
    been hopelessly stove in, and after them came Barrington&rsquo;s boat, &ldquo;swum
    in&rdquo; by natives and the rest of his crew; the third canoe was yet out
    amid the tumbling breakers a quarter of a mile away, but showing up now and
    then a black spot amid the white seeth of swirling foam.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  cried Sru, &ldquo;Railik my son hath cause to be last;
    for, see there are yet three more of the <i>rebelli</i> swimming in the shallow
    water near to his canoe &mdash;the current hath swept them far down. Even
    now do I see the three heads above the water.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And away out in the canoe, Railik with his long black hair streaming out
    to the gale, saw them too, and urged his men to paddle hard. Ten minutes
    before he had picked up Barrington and the missionary&rsquo;s wife, and as
    a whiff of spray smote him fiercely in the face he shook the water from his
    eyes and glanced down to see if the woman was yet alive, for she lay in the
    bottom of the canoe with her head supported by a native boy. Up for&rsquo;ard,
    lying on his back with the blood still flowing from his head was Barrington.
    Presently he sought to rise and placed one hand on the gunwale of the canoe.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nay, stay thou quiet, J&#257;ki,&rdquo; said the native who paddled
    on the bow thwart and whose feet were placed one on each side of the white
    man&rsquo;s body, &ldquo;try not to rise, for should I miss but one stroke
    of my paddle then does the canoe fill and thou and the white woman might
    be drowned.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Another sea swept by them with an angry hiss and the canoe buried her outrigger
    deep down, and Railik, with his left hand grasping the steering paddle bent
    down and scooped out the water with half a dozen quick strokes of the wooden
    baler. Then in another minute the canoe shot alongside the three struggling
    men&mdash;two of Barrington&rsquo;s crew and the missionary.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;  cried Sru, turning to his people, &ldquo;he hath got
    them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then those who watched saw the canoe, now sunk deep in the water, head
    for the shore, as with a wild cry of triumph, heard even through the hum
    of the wind and the thunder of the surf, the half-nude paddlers sent her
    flying to the beach.</p>
  <p>A swarm of natives crowded round as Railik, panting hotly for his breath,
    stood up, and cast his paddle on the sand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How many hast thou,&rdquo; said Sru.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Four, O father Sru&mdash;three men and one woman. And, see, he there
    who hath the bloodied face is J&#257;ki&mdash;the woman is his wife! &rdquo;</p>
  <p>A sudden silence fell upon the crowd of natives, but no one spoke.</p>
  <p>Then, muttering something in a savage undertone to his crew, the chiefs
    son, without another glance at the people he had saved from death, strode
    away towards the village, and his father told those about him to carry Barrington
    and the white woman to his house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tend them well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for when the storm is ceased
    the ship will come back for them. So, give them all to eat and drink, and
    then in a little while when their strength has come back will I ask of this
    dog J&#257;ki how it is he bringeth back a new wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Held in the arms of a tall, slender native girl, who looked pityingly down
    upon her trembling figure, Helen Parker opened her lips and spoke.</p>
  <p align="center"><a name="page164"></a><br>
    <img src="2001271h-images/page164.jpg" width="516" height="750"></p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where is J&#257;ki?&rdquo; she said.</p>
  <p>A woman who stood close to pointed to a number of men who were helping Barrington
    up over the brow of the beach. &ldquo;Thy husband is there. He is badly hurt
    and like to die. Who art thou that speaks our tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I am the Christ-woman from Ponap&eacute;. Take me to my husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And leading her by the hands the girl and woman walked with her to the chiefs
    house, and pointed to the figure of Jack Barrington, who lay upon a mat with
    some native women bandaging his head.</p>
  <p>She stood over him for a moment trying to speak; but her voice failed her.
    At last she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God, Mr. Barrington, you are alive. The natives tell me my
    husband is badly hurt. Where is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No answer came and then looking into the ghastly, pallid face of the man
    she loved, she forgot all, and, kneeling beside him, took his face in her
    hands and kissed him again and again.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>Railik, speeding along through the groves of cocoanut and bananas towards
    the dwelling of old Tariva, took no heed of the crash and roar of the storm
    that now seemed to shake the island to its foundations. He knew that even
    if the few people who lived in the village on the little island with N&#257;dee
    and the old woman had left it with the intention of seeing the boats land
    from the ship they would have returned to their houses again in the face
    of such a wild sea as was now breaking over the connecting reef that lay
    between their village and the main island. No canoe could cross the lagoon
    now and to walk round by way of the beach on the lee side would take them
    many hours. So on he pushed, through the fast-gathering darkness and the
    clashing and tearing of the countless palm tops above him and the frightened
    shrieks of the sea birds, and the growling thunder of the mighty seas as
    they dashed against the barrier wall of coral rock to pour like cataracts
    along its level top into the shallow waters of the lagoon.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Then, when he came within sight of the tiny village of four houses he lay
    down in the darkness and waited. He wanted to see Tariva alone, and would
    watch for her.</p>
  <p>One by one the fires were lighted in the houses, and then he caught a glimpse
    of N&#257;dee as she passed out of Tariva&rsquo;s house to one that stood
    about fifty yards away.</p>
  <p>Springing to his feet he glided through the swaying, wind-tossed palms till
    he reached the back of the old woman&rsquo;s house, and looked through the
    cane lattice-work of its walls.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tariva,&rdquo;  he called, &ldquo; &rsquo;tis I, Railik. Come thou
    outside, so that we may talk; for I be in haste.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>In a few seconds he saw her figure coming towards him, her white hair blowing
    and whipping about her face as she peered out into the darkness. &ldquo;Here,
    mother,&rdquo;  and he put out his hand.</p>
  <p>She took it in silence and then they walked together till they reached a
    great <i>nudu</i> tree, behind the buttressed trunk of which they stood for
    shelter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now is the time come for thee, Tariva, to prove thy friendship to
    me, and give me N&#257;dee.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That would I have done long since; but the girl waited for her white
    husband; but, see, here do I show my friendship for thee! Only but a little
    time since we talked together and to-morrow did I mean to bring her to thee,
    for now she believeth that her husband will come not back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Railik laughed&mdash;&ldquo;Mother, he hath come back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then why, O Railik dost thou come here to fool me? How can I give
    her to thee, if J&#257;ki hath come. Dost think thou can&rsquo;st force her <i>now?</i>&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mother, listen. But little time have I to talk, even of such a matter
    as this; for I must hasten back. See, now, and then tell me if I am not wise.
    Two boats came from the ship and both were overpowered by the seas and the
    people in them cast out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;  answered the old dame, &ldquo;would they were all eaten
    by the sharks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then I and four others in my canoe, and Sirra and Tasa in their canoes,
    went out to them&mdash;and it came about that I saw that two of the <i>rebelli</i> were
    washed outside the reef apart from the others, and lo, they were a man and
    a woman&mdash;and the man was J&#257;ki. Just was he, and the woman with
    him, about to sink, when we dragged them in; for he had a great wound in
    his head.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah&eacute;, and the woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She was as one dead, And I, mother, when I saw the face of the white
    man, would have let him drown, but those with me said&mdash;nay, hurt him
    not, dost thou not see &rsquo;tis the husband of N&#257;dee? So, though I
    would have struck my paddle into his brain I feared to do so. But, tell me,
    hath not the Christ-woman I have heard thee speak of hair like the yellow
    of the sun.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo;  said the old woman quickly, clutching his wrist, &ldquo;and
    was it she who was with him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And was not the man&mdash;her husband, the Christ-wizard&mdash; little
    and dark with a face ugly to look upon?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, little and dark, with hair black as night,&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Railik laughed. &ldquo;See how I remember these things that thou hast told
    me. Now, as J&#257;ki and the woman lay in the canoe I knew she was the Christ-woman
    thou hast so oft told me of and then I had no wish to do him harm, for I
    knew that she was wife to him, even as thou hast told N&#257;dee she would
    be.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  and the old woman ground her teeth, &ldquo;the lying
    white man. Why did&rsquo;st thou not cast them over again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So we turned shoreward and as we rose to the sea I saw Sirra and
    his men take up another woman and a man from the sea, even as I had done;
    and as we crossed over the reef we saw three more <i>rebelli</i> struggling
    in the shallow water between the reef and the shore. And when we came to
    them I saw that two were ship-men and the other a little, dark-faced man
    with a smooth face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The Christ-man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Aye, the Christ-man. And then knew I that the woman who lay in the
    canoe was not wife to J&#257;ki, and while the thought of N&#257;dee was
    hot within me and my men helped in the two ship-men I sprang into the sea
    as if to save the Christ-man and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah&rdquo;&mdash;and the old woman&rsquo;s eyes glistened</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And took him by the hair and dived with him and struck his head against
    a rock beneath so that he died quickly. This did I because I told those with
    me that J&#257;ki had now a new wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou art both brave and wise, my son. I can see what is to thy mind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That to-morrow thou shalt bring N&#257;dee and show her the white
    woman and J&#257;ki sitting together in my father&rsquo;s house? and say, &lsquo;See,
    thy white man with his new wife&mdash;the Christ-woman from Ponap&eacute;.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo;  said the old dame, pulling his face down to hers and
    embracing him, &ldquo;now go, and leave what else is to be done to me.&rdquo; </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
    A Convert Through Love</b></h2>
  <p>The storm had nearly ceased, and although the wind was yet high and the
    branches of a hundred thousand graceful palms thrashed and bent and swayed
    wildly to its whistling note, overhead the blue sky was unspecked by a single
    cloud.</p>
  <p>Kate Trenton awoke as she lay upon her couch of mats in the house of Sru,
    the chief, and looking out through the opened window up into the star-spangled
    heavens thanked God that her life had been spared, and that He had spared
    Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s too.</p>
  <p>She rose softly and looked at the three sleeping figures that lay near her.
    That which was nearest was her sister, and Kate, taking a rude oil lamp in
    her hand sank on her knees beside her, and with tears welling fast to her
    eyes scanned the pale face of the sleeping woman, and then touched lovingly
    the bright golden curls that clustered about her temples.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sleep, sleep, dear Helen&rdquo; she murmured, and then she moved
    silently away again to the little window and gazed out past the wildly tossing
    plumes of the cocoanut grove that encompassed the house, at the rearing,
    leaping billows that rolled with a dulled but savage symphony upon the black
    line of reef a half a mile away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poor Hosea&rdquo; she said, and then her tears fell fast. &ldquo;He
    had so often said that he would willingly give his life if need be for his
    work, and now to think of him lying out there,&rdquo; and she turned away
    from the window with a sob, and covered her face with her hands.</p>
  <p>For nearly an hour the girl lay upon her couch till the light of the lamp
    paled in the silent house and the grey light of the dawn stole through the
    serried boles and crowns of the countless palm trees. Drawing over her shoulders,
    with a strange, happy feeling in her heart, a seaman&rsquo;s pea-jacket,
    which she had found placed beside her couch and knew was Herrera&rsquo;s,
    she walked noiselessly over to the wicker door, stepped outside, and sat
    down upon a great, flat slab of coral.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He loves me, he loves me&rdquo; she kept saying to herself with a
    whispering, joyous laugh,  &ldquo;and I love him. How can I help loving him,
    he is so good and brave.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A step on the gravel made her look up and the man who was in her heart stood
    beside her, with his black, passionate eyes looking into hers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It is very cold, Mr. Herrera,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;and I have
    your coat. But I am going in again now. I only came out because I could not
    sleep with the dreadful sound of the surf, and&mdash; &rdquo;</p>
  <p>She stopped, and then as she was about to rise he sank at her feet and seizing
    her hands in his covered them with kisses.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kate, Kate. Do not go just yet. I love you. See, sweet one, there
    is no one here to hear us. Do you think that I have been sleeping? No! I
    have been lying there beside Barrington watching you, and waiting for the
    moment when I could come to you and tell you that I love you. Love you, Kate!
    Holy Saints forgive me, but yesterday I cursed the poor padre, because I
    thought he would come between us. And I, with the devil in my heart to get
    you, would have run a knife into my own father before that should happen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Trembling, partly with joy and partly with fear at his passionate words,
    Kate Trenton let him draw her to him, and then he kissed her again and again.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, Kate,&rdquo; and the man&rsquo;s voice trembled as he turned
    her face to him and looked into her honest eyes, &ldquo;I, Jos&eacute; Herrera,
    swear to you by the soul of my mother and my belief in heaven and hell that
    if you will marry me, I, too, will become one of your faith&mdash;that would
    I do if my mother rose from her grave and cursed me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute;,&rdquo;  &mdash;and there was a happy trill in her voice&mdash;&ldquo;I
    am so glad . . because I love you.&rdquo; Then, as the sound of footsteps
    sounded near them on the pebbly path, she glided away from him inside the
    house, and the first mate of the <i>Kellet Passmore</i>, picking up the jacket
    she had dropped, walked round to the little window, and tapping softly on
    the cane-work side, held up the jacket in view.</p>
  <p>A white hand and arm came out of the gloom of the still darkened room and
    Kate Trenton&rsquo;s fingers touched his bearded face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;I will see you
    again soon, sweet Kate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then he walked quickly away to the beach. </p>
  <p>Forty-eight hours before Jos&eacute; Herrera had talked with his boat&rsquo;s
    crew on board the barque, and had promised each man a hundred dollars the
    day they landed him and Kate Trenton at Guam.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;God is good to me,&rdquo; he said, piously crossing himself. &ldquo;Two
    days ago I was ready to kill the poor padre and run the lives of five men
    into danger on a long boat voyage. And now the poor padre is dead and there
    is no need for me to commit a crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Then, as he had no tobacco to smoke, he sat down on the cool sand watching
    the paling stars and wondering when the <i>Kellet Passmore</i> would turn
    up again. &ldquo;<i>Dios</i>,&rdquo;  he said, clasping his small, sinewy
    hands around his knees, &ldquo;Kate and I may be married in a month from
    now. if we touch at Guam. And touch there we shall, if I run the ship ashore
    in the night.&rdquo; </p>

    His Native Wife</b></h2>
  <p>With the first red streaks of sunrise through the palm-grove, came the murmur
    of voices and the tramp of naked feet about the gravelled paths that led
    to the chiefs house, and Helen Parker awoke to her sister&rsquo;s kiss.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Kate,&rdquo;  and the pale face lightened up as she drew the girl
    to her bosom, &ldquo;I have had such a long sleep, and feel so well and strong,&rdquo; and
    then her eyes wandered over to where Barrington lay with Jos&eacute; Herrera
    sitting by his side.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will he die?&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;how horribly white his
    face is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Die? Silly Helen! No, dear; but Mr. Herrera says that the cut in
    his head is something terrible, and that he will be very weak for a long
    time from loss of blood,&rdquo;  and then Kate laid her cheek to Helen&rsquo;s, &ldquo;but
    we will nurse him in turns, dear. I would be so miserable if he died, Helen,
    for Jos&eacute;&mdash;I mean Mr. Herrera&mdash;told me that not only did
    he save your life, but his and mine too, for, before swimming out to you,
    he told two of his men to go to our aid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen pressed her hand, and again she glanced at the pallid features of
    the sleeping man, and Jos&eacute; Herrera nodded and smiled reassuringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen,&rdquo;  and Kate&rsquo;s arm stole round her waist, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
    weep, dear. It was his wish to die at his post. It is such men as he who
    win the crown of glory for the cause of Christ.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helen Parker shuddered and then a hot flush dyed her face; she had not been
    thinking of her dead husband as Kate imagined, but of the man who had all
    but given his life for hers.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>The tramping sound of naked feet on the gravelled paths around the house
    increased, and Herrera rose and came over to them.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The native women are bringing baskets of food and placing them outside,&rdquo; he
    said to Kate, &ldquo;they are very anxious to come inside and talk to you
    both, but Sru, the chief, has forbade them to make any noise. He thinks you
    are still asleep. Would you like to come outside for a little? They are getting
    us something to eat, I can see.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Moving very quietly so as not to awaken Barrington, Herrera opened the door
    and Helen and Kate followed him outside, and faced the crowd of natives who
    sat awaiting them. A little apart from the rest, and seated on a mat fringed
    with scarlet parrots&rsquo; feathers, was Sru, the chief; behind him, his
    wife and Railik his son. </p>
  <p>A murmur of approval broke from the people as Helen stepped across to the
    chief and spoke to him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We thank thee, Sru of L&#335;sap, that thou and thy people have saved
    us from death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit thou there, Christ-woman, thou and the other woman and the dark-faced
    ship man,&rdquo; and the chief pointed to where, among the rest of the whaling
    gear saved from the boats, the four line tubs were placed side by side, &ldquo;sit
    thou there, and while my women get ready food for thee to eat, let us talk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They sat down and waited for him to speak, and Herrera who, although he
    could not speak the language, knew by the chief&rsquo;s manner that something
    was wrong, looked anxiously around for his and Barrington&rsquo;s boats&rsquo; crews.
    Not one was to be seen.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Suddenly with a fierce scowl at Helen the chief raised his huge, brawny
    arm, and, with his open palm struck the mat upon which he sat.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Christ-woman, why came ye here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The rude, rough words &mdash; so different from what she expected, started
    and alarmed her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why such angry words to those who have been cast upon the beach by
    the waves, O Sru.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;  &rsquo;Tis to thee alone I speak, thou stealer of women&rsquo;s
    husbands. See,&rdquo; and he sprang to his feet, and pointed to the oars,
    lances, and harpoons that lay piled together by the tubs, &ldquo;there be
    all the things that were taken from the boats. Now listen, and make the dark-faced
    ship-man by thy side understand my words. Presently, when ye have eaten and
    drank, shall my people fill the one boat that is unbroken with food and water
    and then shall ye all get to the boat and go away from my land and seek the
    ship again. But the white man J&#257;ki shall stay.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Utterly at a loss to account for the chief&rsquo;s angry words and inhospitable
    manner, Helen answered him&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why to me alone, O Sru of L&#335;sap, is thy anger turned? And how
    am I a stealer of women&rsquo;s husbands?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is not J&#257;ki the husband of N&#257;dee?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>An agony of shame for the moment overcame her. She knew how prone the native
    mind was to suspicion, and hastened to explain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He is not my husband. My husband is dead but yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And then in as few words as possible she told how it was that she and her
    husband came to take passage in the whaler, and then asked the chief if he
    did not know that her husband was dead.</p>
  <p>He listened to the end and then answered coldly&mdash;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What lies are these? Are we fools? Are not every one that were in
    the boats alive and well, but J&#257;ki? Thou dost but say this for fear
    of thy life, thou cunning Christ-woman. Old Tariva knoweth of thy love for
    the husband of N&#257;dee, and hath told us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>For a minute she was too dazed to speak, and then a young girl who sat directly
    in front of her took up a small piece of broken coral and tossed it at her
    feet contemptuously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thou stealer of women&rsquo;s husbands,&rdquo; she said with a mocking
    laugh, and then came a chorus of gibes and jeers.</p>
  <p>Herrera, with a red gleam in his eyes, sprang up, and in another moment
    Helen had fainted in her sister&rsquo;s arms.</p>
  <p>Lifting her up in his arms, Herrera carried her back to the house and laid
    her down. </p>
  <p>Kate followed him in, and splashing her face with water she soon revived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What is wrong, dear? Why is that dreadful-looking man so angry?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t ask me now, Kate. Mr. Herrera, we
    must leave the island at once; our lives are in peril else. The chief says
    that as soon as we have eaten something we must go away; and that he will
    provision the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;<i>Dios!</i> Is the man mad?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Helen, hurriedly. &ldquo;I know the cause of
    it all. A fierce old woman named Tariva, who was once at Ponap&eacute; and
    hates the missionaries bitterly, has poisoned his mind against us&mdash;me
    in particular. We must go, Mr. Herrera. I know our danger. She is a terrible
    woman, and would have great influence over these L&#335;sap natives,&rdquo; and
    then she added in calmer tones, &ldquo;leave me here, please. I cannot face
    those women again, but they will offer no harm to either Kate or you. Go,
    Mr. Herrera, I beg of you, and see to the boat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The mate, with a sympathetic grasp of his hand, turned to go. &ldquo;Do
    not fear, ladies. We will be safe enough in the boat, and even if we miss
    the ship we can run down to Truk, with this wind, in thirty hours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The moment Herrera stood outside two of his boat&rsquo;s crew met him, and
    he learned that the four Maoris had told them that they had been asked by
    the natives to remain on the island; but that all the others, except Barrington,
    were to go, or they would be killed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All right, boys, let the Maoris stay &mdash; we don&rsquo;t want
    them. Where&rsquo;s Pedro and Tom, and the boatsteerer?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down at the boat, stowing her with baskets of food. She&rsquo;s about
    a mile further down on the beach.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very well, go down and lend them a hand. Here; take the oars down
    to the boat, and pull up here as quick as you can. I will stay with the ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Picking up the oars the men walked quickly away along the beach, and Herrera
    saw with astonishment that there was not a native about. They had all gone
    into their houses and seemed to show the most utter indifference to the movements
    of the white men.</p>
  <p>He sat down on one of the line tubs, and presently Kate Trenton, her face
    pale with excitement, joined him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Helen is coming presently,&rdquo; she said, and she sat beside him
    and placed her trembling hand in his.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>Slowly Barrington opened his eyes and gazed stupidly around him. A raging
    thirst and a sound of some one sobbing had roused him from his death-like
    sleep, and in a faint voice he called for water.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; murmured Helen, and raising his head on her arm
    she placed a young cocoanut to his lips.</p>
  <p>He drank, and then with a heavy sigh sank back on the rolled-up mat that
    formed his pillow, and closed his eyes again.</p>
  <p>She knelt beside him for a few moments with her hands clasped tightly together,
    and then bent down and kissed him &mdash;for the last time.</p>
  <p>Then came the sound of the crunching gravel outside and the doorway of the
    house was darkened by two figures, but she heard nor saw them not, as she
    sobbed out her heart over the unconscious man.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, N&#257;dee, see thy white husband and the Christ-woman for whom
    he hath cast thee off,&rdquo; and then the old woman slipped a knife into
    the girl&rsquo;s hand. As N&#257;dee sprang forward Helen raised her face;
    and then the knife flashed and sank deep down into her heart and stilled
    it for ever.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * *</p>
  <p>A wild, shrieking laugh made Kate Trenton and Jos&eacute; Herrera spring
    to their feet, to see a hideous old woman with long, snow-white hair standing
    at the door of the chiefs house, and the next moment a young girl, as fair-skinned
    almost as Kate herself, stepped outside.</p>
  <p>Again that awful, screeching laugh rang out, and the hag took the girl by
    the hand and led her out in full view of the village. Then she spoke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See, O men of L&#335;sap. See the red hand of N&#257;dee. Hold thou
    it up, my wood-dove, and let them see the blood of the Christ-woman who stole
    thy lover from thee with her strong witchcraft.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And N&#257;dee, with blazing eyes and panting bosom, held up the bloodied
    knife.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * *</p>
  <p>At sunset that night the whaleboat, with Kate Trenton&rsquo;s head pillowed
    against her lover&rsquo;s bosom, was fifty miles away; and Jack Barrington
    with a glad cry awoke to find bending over him the calm face of his native
    wife.</p>
