    What the Teamster Said</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IntheDaysoftheGoldEscorts"></a>In the Days  of the Gold Escorts</b></h2>
  <p>Some  seventy years ago, two Scotsmen, John and Andrew Paterson were &ldquo;squatting&rdquo; at a  station called Buckenbah, somewhere near the town of Obley, in the western district of New South  Wales. This place was held on lease from the Crown at a few pence per acre and  was worth no more. It was dingo-infested, unfenced country where the sheep had  to be shepherded and the cattle, as the blackboys said, could go &ldquo;longa bush&rdquo;  and wander afield until they got into somebody else&rsquo;s meat cask or could be  mustered and driven away by enterprising people who adopted this cheap method  of stocking-up. In these surroundings, I, the immature verse-writer, son of  Andrew Paterson, had my first taste of bush life.</p>
  <p>My  father was a lowland Scot, a son of a captain in the old East India Company&rsquo;s  service, though his family before him had for generations farmed their own  properties in Lanarkshire. One of my father&rsquo;s forbears was John Paterson, of  Lochlyoch, who founded the breed of Clydesdale horses by importing a black  Flemish stallion called Robin.</p>
  <p>Robin  was to the Clydesdale breed what Eclipse was to the thoroughbred, as may be  seen in the Clydesdale stud book. There was also a further connection with  horses in that my grandfather, going out to India to seek his fortune, joined up  with John Company&rsquo;s army, in which his original rank was that of a roughrider.  He rode the rough horses so well that he afterwards obtained his commission;  and it is something of a coincidence that in the Great War more than a hundred  years afterwards I, his grandson, was given a command as major in a roughriding  unit. This, and my early experiences as a small shepherd, may account for  whatever of accuracy there may be in my versified descriptions of bush life and  of horses.</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/1-1.jpg" width="340" height="457"></p>
  <p>An  ancestor whose talents I, unfortunately, failed to inherit was William  Paterson, who founded the Bank of England, He is described in the Encyclopaedia  as a &ldquo;Scotch adventurer,&rdquo; and &ldquo;adventurer&rdquo; is right, for, not satisfied with  starting the Bank of England on its primrose path, he aspired to follow the  example of Clive and Hastings and found a sort of Scottish East India Company  at Darien, on the Isthmus of Panama. Had his Bank of England luck stuck to him  he might have been another Cecil Rhodes, for the Scotchmen poured their money  into the venture, but the malaria and the mosquitoes beat him, and he returned  to Scotland  to face his countrymen who had lost their money. Instead of upbraiding him they  subscribed &pound;10,000 to put him on his feet again! Of my father I saw little, for  he was mostly away pioneering in Queensland.  There he had a skirmish with blacks, during which his cousin, James Paterson,  had his spectacles knocked off his nose by the tip of a boomerang: he tried to  take sheep out to some new place, but was caught on flooded country between two  rivers, and had to shear them on a sandhill; and finally he had to get out of  Queensland &mdash; just another of the many pioneers who unsuccessfully threw dice  with fate. I never knew the name of his place in Queensland, but I understand it  adjoined Lammermuir, the station described in &ldquo;Christison of Lammermuir,&rdquo;  probably the second best tale ever told of bush life; Jeannie Gunn&rsquo;s &ldquo;We of the  Never Never&rdquo; being the best.</p>
  <p>However,  to meet losses in Queensland, Buckenbah had to  go, and we moved to Illalong, a station in the southern part of New South Wales. Here we  were on a main road between Sydney and Melbourne, with the Lambing Flat  diggings, now called Young, only a day&rsquo;s ride away. It was an unlucky place &mdash;  enough to break anyone&rsquo;s heart &mdash; for the Free Selection Act had just been  passed, and the selectors, droves of them, all seemed to pick on us, as there  were creeks everywhere which solved for them the water problem.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TeamstersNightmare"></a>Teamster&rsquo;s  Nightmare</b></h2>
<p>But  all these troubles meant nothing to me, a boy of six. There were swimming pools  in the creek 10 feet deep and half a mile long, horses to ride, and the tides  of life surged round us. The gold escort from Lambing Flat, too, came by twice  a week, with a mounted trooper riding in front with his rifle at the ready and  another armed trooper on the box with the coachman. I used to hope that the  escort would be &ldquo;stuck up&rdquo; outside our place so that I might see something  worth while, but what with the new settlers and the scores of bullock teams  taking loading out to the back country, no bushranger stood half a chance of  making a getaway unseen.</p>
<p>The  roads were quite unmade, and when one track got so cut up that a waggon would  sink down to its axles, the bullockies would try a new track. Thus the highway  became a labyrinth of tracks, half a mile wide, with here and there an  excavation where a waggon had been dug out, and when, as often happened a  waggon got stuck in the bed of the creek they would hitch two teams of bullocks  to it and then (as one of the bullockies said) either the waggon or the bed of  the creek had to come.</p>
<p>I  was not encouraged to go anywhere near the bullockies, who were supposed to be  up to stratagems and spoils, especially in the way of stealing horses, but a  lonely child will go anywhere for company, and I found that they travelled with  their families, dogs, and sometimes even fowls. These latter gentry after  fossicking about the camp for worms and grasshoppers, would hop up into the  waggon as soon as the bullocks were yoked, making for their crate where a  little food awaited them. They hurried too!</p>
<p>I  found that these teamsters were like Bracken&rsquo;s hero &mdash; &ldquo;not understood.&rdquo; Hard as  it may be to believe, they were really fond of their bullocks, and only took  the whip to shirkers. One of them gave me a demonstration with a bullock-whip,  cutting great furrows in the bark of a white gum tree. When I said that it was  no wonder the bullocks pulled, he remarked, feelingly &ldquo;Sonny, if I done that to  them bullocks I&rsquo;d want shooting. Every bullock knows his name, and when I speak  to him he&rsquo;s into the yoke. I&rsquo;d look well knockin&rsquo; &lsquo;em about with a hundred  miles to go and them not gettin&rsquo; a full feed once a week. Many a night I&rsquo;ve dug  up a panel of a squatter&rsquo;s paddock and slipped &lsquo;em in, and I&rsquo;ve been back there  before daylight to slip &lsquo;em out and put the panel up agen. So long as they&rsquo;ll  stick to me I&rsquo;ll stick to them.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Which,  somehow, recalls the story of the bullock driver who was asked to join up for  the South African war and was told that he need not fight as he would be more  useful driving bullocks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  me!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner fight. If there come any trouble, all you coves could  run away, but I&rsquo;d have to stop with the bullocks, and get caught!&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time I had learnt to ride and to get me away it was decided that I should  ride four miles to school every day in Binalong, a two-pub town famous for the  fact that the bushranger Gilbert was buried in the police paddock. Here I sat  on a hard wooden form alongside some juvenile relatives of Gilbert.</p>
<p>Carlyle  in his &ldquo;Sartor Resartus&rdquo; speaks of his hero, Diogenes Teudelsdrock, as being  educated at the Academy   of Hinterschlag  (stern-whackers), and there was plenty of Hinterschlag at this little bush  school in Binalong. The master, Moore by name, had to meet emergencies of one  sort or another every day, and he met them like a Napoleon. Spare, gaunt, and  Irish by descent, he ran to gamecocks and kangaroo dogs in his private moments.  It was nothing unusual for his flock to go out with him in the long summer  afternoons to watch a course after a kangaroo, and the elite of the school, the  pound-keeper&rsquo;s son and the blacksmith&rsquo;s boy, would be allowed as a favour to  stop after school and watch a &ldquo;go-in&rdquo; between two cocks without the steel  spurs, as part of their training for more serious business.</p>
<p>One  day the sergeant of police from Yass, in plain clothes, drove up to the door of  the school in a natty little trap with a pair of ponies. We jumped to the conclusion  that he had heard of this cockfighting business, and we expected (and hoped) to  see the schoolmaster led away like Eugene Aram with gyves upon his wrist. While  the sergeant was inside with the teacher we children swarmed all over his  buggy, and there in a neat lattice-lined box under the seat we found a  gamecock, clipped and looking for fight!</p>
<p>The  gamecock was rather surprised to see us in charge of his caravan, but not  nearly so astonished as we were to see HIM. It was our &mdash; or, at any rate, my &mdash;  first introduction to the ways of the world and to those who go about in sheep&rsquo;s  clothing, but are inwardly ravening wolves.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSportofKings"></a>The Sport of  Kings</b></h2>
<p>Apart  from his sporting proclivities, there was little fault to find with our  teacher. Poor man, he was almost daily confronted by irate mothers, real rough  sorts, whose children he had whipped, and who threatened to bring &ldquo;the old man&rdquo;  down to deal with him if it ever happened again.</p>
<p>My  first introduction to the racing business came about in this way. It was a New  Year&rsquo;s Day and a general holiday. My father was away, and the station  roustabout having filled the water-barrel, cut the wood and fed the fowls, was  free to go to the Bogolong races some eight mile, away. He suggested that I  should go with him, and my mother agreed, though I would not have had a  hundred-to-one chance of getting leave from my father. Picture us then, a youth  of eighteen and a boy of eight setting out to take part in the sport of kings!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/1-2.jpg" width="306" height="450"></p>
<p>Bogolong  (now called Bookham) was a township on the main southern road, and consisted of  two &ldquo;pubs,&rdquo; half a mile apart, with nothing in between! When I asked the  roustabout what had happened to the rest of the town, he said &ldquo;This is all they  is. One pub to ketch the coves coming from Yass and the other to ketch the  coves from Jugiong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  track was about half a mile out of the town, unfenced, with no grandstand, and  was mostly laid out through a gum and stringy-bark scrub. The racehorses were  tied to saplings, as were hundreds of other horses ridden by wild men from the Murrumbidgee Mountains, who had all brought their  dogs. There was a sprinkling of more civilised sportsmen from Yass and Jugiong,  blackfellows and half-castes from everywhere, and a few out-and-outers who had  ridden down from Lobb&rsquo;s Hole, a place so steep that (as the horse-boy said) the  horses wore all the hair off their tails sliding down the mountains. The days  of racing in heats (i.e., running the horses three times against each other to  see which was the best) had died out everywhere except in these outlandish  places; but there was one heat race still on the programme. This was the  Bogolong Town Plate of a mile, possibly the last heat race that was ever run  anywhere.</p>
<p>I  had ridden over on a pony with a child&rsquo;s saddle, glancing at the pony to see  that he was all right, I saw a Murrumbidgee mountaineer about seven feet high  taking the saddle off my pony and putting it on a racehorse. Running over to  him, I managed to gasp out &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my saddle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-oh,  son&rdquo; he said &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t hurt it. It&rsquo;s just the very thing the doctor ordered. It&rsquo;s  ketch weights, and this is the lightest saddle here so I took it before anybody  else got it. This is Pardon,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and after he wins this heat you come  to me an I&rsquo;ll stand you a bottle of ginger beer.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ASlightDispute"></a>A Slight  Dispute</b></h2>
<p>In  after years a man who speculated largely told me that he could put ten thousand  pounds into a speculation without a tremor, but if he put a pound on a horse he  could hardly hold his glasses steady enough to watch the race. Imagine then,  the excitement with which I watched Pardon&rsquo;s progress &mdash; watched him lying  behind the leaders as they went out of sight behind the stringy-bark scrub;  watched them come into sight again, with Pardon still lying third; and then the  crowning moment as he drew away in the straight and won comfortably. Greater  still, the delirious joy when he led the field all the way in the second heat,  so that there was no need to run a third.</p>
<p>I  had the ginger beer &mdash; bitter, luke-warm stuff with hops in it &mdash; but what did I  care? My new friend assured me that Pardon could not have won without my  saddle. It had made all the difference. Years afterwards, I worked the incident  into a sort of ballad called &ldquo;Pardon, the son of Reprieve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  had eight miles to go to get home, so we had to leave before things got really  lively but before we departed two men had an argument about a bet and each made  a run to pull a stirrup-iron out of his saddle.</p>
<p>My  old friend the sergeant of police from Yass had no objection to a fight, but he  drew the line at stirrup-irons! He and the mounted trooper handcuffed first one  man and then the other with their arms round saplings, a performance which I  had never seen before and have never seen since.</p>
<p>As  we rode home through the shades of evening we passed by the door of Dacey&rsquo;s  selection; and old blind Geoffrey, a giant of an English agricultural labourer,  who was living out his last few years as a pensioner on the bounty of Dacey,  came out when he heard the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  beat?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Of  course I had to pipe up that Pardon won the Town Plate with my saddle on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ar  cares naught aboot that,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;Who beat &mdash; the Prodestans or the Carthlics?&rdquo;</p>

  When the Booms Burst
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="GiantsofthePaddlePenandPencil"></a>Giants of the Paddle, Pen, and Pencil
  </b></h2>
<p>When  I was sent to school in Sydney  a new world opened before me. As a start my cousin and I bought an old boat,  mostly held together by tar, and by way of brightening up the colour scheme we  painted the floor with white paint over the tar. This was not entirely  satisfactory, as the tar turned the paint to a sort of unwholesome muddy  colour, which refused to dry; so then we had to buy caustic soda to remove both  tar and paint and begin all over again. When we got her finished she was a fine  fishing boat, for there was generally as much water inside as out, which kept  our fish fresh till we got them home.</p>
<p>But  fishing was only a sideline; our real interest lay in the scullers who worked  on the championship course right in front of our door. Beginning with Hickey  and Rush, on down through Ned Trickett and Elias Laycock, to Beach and Hanlan,  Stanbury and Maclean, last and greatest of them all, Harry Searle &mdash; we knew  every man of them, and could tell them by their styles at three-quarters of a  mile distance.</p>
<p>Stalking  with their trainers through the little town of Gladesville, they were like Kingsley&rsquo;s  Gladiators stalking through the degenerate Romans. Elias Laycock could eat a  dozen eggs for breakfast; Maclean, an axe-man from the northern rivers, could  take an axe in either hand, and fell any tree without stopping for rest; Searle  had an extra rib on either side of his body, or so his opponents implicitly  believed. A flaxen-haired giant, he was the hero of a queer incident at a dance  given at the Gladesville   Mental Hospital. These  dances were for the amusement of the patients, and all visitors were expected  to dance with them. A lady from Sydney,  no less than a daughter of Sir William Windeyer, Judge of the Supreme Court,  was very good-natured about it all, and after trotting several of the patients  out she invited Searle to have a turn.</p>
<p>On  coming back to her chaperon she said &ldquo;What a pity that fine young man is mad.  He talked quite sensibly until all of a sudden he said that he was the champion  sculler of the world. I got away from him as soon as I could!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These  great scullers were mostly young country men reared on home-grown food, and it  would be hard to find their equals in these days of flats and tinned  vegetables. The discovery of Beach, the Dapto blacksmith, was due to Dr.  Fortescue, a great surgeon of those days, who had his home on the Parramatta River.</p>
<p>Somebody  brought Beach to see him, and the doctor said that he had never seen such a  perfect physical specimen. &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will beat that little Canadian&rdquo;  (Hanlan). He backed his opinion with his money, too, helping Beach to get boats  and a trainer. Hanlan was so superior to all other scullers that the  cognoscenti on the River declared that he must have a secret machine in his  wager boat to help him along. This idea was about as sensible as the theory  that the Germans, during the Great War, had a wireless transmitting station up  a gum-tree in the Blue Mountains; but people  would believe anything in those days, and, for that matter, so they will now.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="LegalLuminary"></a>Legal  Luminary</b></h2>
<p>I  went to the Sydney   Grammar School, where I  succeeded in dividing the Junior Knox prize with a boy who is now a Judge of  the High Court. If I had paid as much attention to my lessons as to fish and  rabbits, I too, might have been a Judge of the High Court. There is a lot of  luck in these things!</p>
<p>Leaving  school, I had a try for a bursary at the University, but missed it by about a  mile and half, so I had to go into a lawyer&rsquo;s office. Here I began to learn  more of the world. We did a lot of shipping business and one of my first jobs  was to go out and gather evidence for the defence of a captain who was  prosecuted for not showing a riding-light over the stern while at anchor.  Evidence! It was too easy. The captain had seen the boatswain put out the  riding-light. The boatswain remembered that riding-light well, as he had nearly  fallen overboard while fixing it. The chief officer had been strolling about  the deck and had noticed the reflection of the riding-light on the water. I  chuckled to think how small the opposition would feel when we unloosed our  battery of testimony.</p>
<p>Then  the sea-lawyer who was on the Bench, without whys or wherefores, and without  summing-up, found the captain guilty and fined him a fiver!</p>
<p>I  walked away from the court with the captain, and was just starting to speak a  piece about this awful iniquity when he said: &ldquo;Oh, well, I didn&rsquo;t know you had  to have a riding light. They&rsquo;d drive a man mad with their regulations in these &mdash;  places.&rdquo; An unnerving experience, but it taught me that a case at law is like a  battle: If you listen to the accounts of the two sides you can never believe  that they are talking about the same fight.</p>
<p>Later  on, I became managing cleric for a big legal firm which did the work for three  banks in the depression which preceded the dreary days when the banks  themselves had to shut. For months I did nothing but try to screw money out of  people who had not got it. Then I went into practice for myself, and, of  course, was confronted by closed banks. I saw bank booms, land booms, silver  booms, Northern Territory  booms, and they all had one thing in common &mdash; they always burst. My partner and  I had banked some money for a client in the Bank of New Zealand, and we were  told that &ldquo;she was sure to shut.&rdquo; We shifted the money into another bank and  the New Zealand  concern weathered the storm, while the bank into which we had put the money  folded up like a blanket!</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PoetbyCircumstance"></a>Poet by  Circumstance</b></h2>
<p>We  managed to keep going even through the depression and when a cavalry officer  came out from England  and started a polo club we took to the game like ducks to water. This polo  business brought us in touch with some of the upper circles &mdash; a great change  after the little bush school, the game-cocks, and the days when I looked upon  the sergeant of police as the greatest man in the world.</p>
<p>We  played a match against the Cooma team, real wild men with cabbage-tree hats,  and skin-tight pants, their hats held on by a strap under their noses. I must  have had the gift of prophecy because, before we went up, I wrote a jingle  called &ldquo;The Geebung Polo Club,&rdquo; a jingle which has outlasted much better work.  But this reminds me that it is time to say something about writing.</p>
<p>Up  to the time of my arrival in Sydney,  my experiences of life had been limited to contacts with the unsophisticated  children of Nature. Had I learnt anything from them? Have I learnt anything  worth while in the sixty years or so which I have lived since? I take leave to  doubt it. There was a time when they called these people the &ldquo;great unwashed,&rdquo;  but I think that the &ldquo;great unsatisfied&rdquo; would be a better name. Fully ninety  per cent. of people have neither as much money nor as high a social position as  that they would like, or (as they think) deserve. In those hard times nobody  was satisfied, so I thought &mdash; like Hamlet &mdash; that it was up to me to set the  world right. I read heavily in history and economics, and the outcome was my  first literary effort &mdash; a pamphlet called &ldquo;Australia for the Australians.&rdquo; I  blush every time that I think of it!</p>
<p>When  my pamphlet fell as flat as the great inland desert, I tried my hand at &ldquo;poetry,&rdquo;  and strung together four flamboyant verses about the expedition against the  Mahdi, who was going well and strong at the time. As &ldquo;The Bulletin&rdquo; was the  most unsatisfied paper in Australia,  I sent them to that paper. I had adopted the pen name of &ldquo;The Banjo,&rdquo; after a  so-called racehorse, which we had on the station. I was afraid to use my own  name lest the editor, identifying me with the author of the pamphlet, would  dump my contribution, unread, into the waste paper basket.</p>
<p>My  verses actually appeared, and in the same issue was a request that I would call  on the editor. Off I went, and climbed a grimy flight of stairs at 24 Pitt Street,  until I stood before a door marked, &ldquo;Mr. Archibald, Editor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On  the door was pinned a spirited drawing of a gentleman lying quite loose on the  strand with a dagger through him; and on the drawing was written: &ldquo;Archie, this  is what will happen to you if you don&rsquo;t use my drawing about the policeman!&rdquo; It  cheered me up a lot. Evidently this was a free and easy place.</p>
<p>Anyone  who wants to know what Archibald looked like should see his portrait by  Florence Rodway in the Sydney   Art Gallery.  It is a marvellous likeness of the bearded and bespectacled Archibald, peering  at a world which was all wrong. Not that he ever put forward any concrete  scheme for setting it right; he diagnosed the diseases, and left others to find  the cure.</p>
<p>In  an interview of ten minutes he said he would like me to try some more verse.  Did I know anything about the bush?</p>
<p>I  told him that I had been reared there. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have a go at the  bush. Have a go at anything that strikes you. Don&rsquo;t write anything like other  people if you can help it. Let&rsquo;s see what you can do.&rdquo; And that is how I came  to meet Henry Lawson.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/lawson.jpg" width="606" height="750"></p>
<p>Henry  Lawson was a man of remarkable insight in some things and of extraordinary  simplicity in others. We were both looking for the same reef, if you get what I  mean; but I had done my prospecting on horseback with my meals cooked for me,  while Lawson had done his prospecting on foot and had had to cook for himself.  Nobody realised this better than Lawson; and one day he suggested that we  should write against each other, he putting the bush from his point of view,  and I putting it from mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  ought to do pretty well out of it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We ought to be able to get in  three or four sets of verses each before they stop us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  suited me all right, for we were working on space, and the pay was very small &mdash;  in fact, I remember getting exactly thirteen and sixpence for writing &ldquo;Clancy  of the Overflow&rdquo; &mdash; so we slam-banged away at each other for weeks and weeks;  not until they stopped us, but until we ran out of material. I think that  Lawson put his case better than I did, but I had the better case, so that  honours (or dishonours) were fairly equal. An undignified affair, but it was a  case of &ldquo;root hog or die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  show how a poet can be without honour (or profit) in his own country, I  remember Lawson&rsquo;s wife telling me that she was quite happy because Henry was &ldquo;working&rdquo;  again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  he working at,&rdquo; I asked, &ldquo;prose or verse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean writing, I mean working. He&rsquo;s gone back to his  trade as a house painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  this was the man whose work was afterwards translated into foreign languages!</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PrematureDeath"></a>Premature  Death</b></h2>
<p>Lawson  had an experience which happens to few people. He fell over a cliff at Manly  and was reported dead. There was no time to make inquiries, so a section of the  Press came out with very flattering obituary notices, which Henry read with  great interest and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>I  asked him what he thought of these final &ldquo;reviews;&rdquo; and he said that, after  reading them, he was puzzled to think how he had managed to be so hard up all  his life!</p>
<p>Other  celebrities of the day were Hopkins  and Phil May. Except that they were both self-taught artists, they were as  unalike as possible in every way. A large expansive person named Traill had  taken a chance on going abroad and hiring Hopkins  in America and Phil May in England. Hopkins was of the large,  somnolent type; but give him an idea for a comic picture and he would make  three jokes grow where only one grew before. May was a bundle of nerves and  vitality, wearing himself out before his time. He had learnt his drawings by  practising on costers and street-arabs in London.</p>
<p>Hopkins  had been reared on a farm in Ohio,  and had then, in the American way, taken a job as conductor on a sleeping car  so that he might see the world. He practised on the passengers, and one has a  vision of Hopkins  peering round the corridor and working by fits and starts. I think it was  Andrew Carnegie who said that, with a bag of oatmeal and determination, a man  could teach himself anything. I took Hopkins  on a trip &mdash; I suppose he would have called it a buggyride &mdash; down through the  rough country to the head of the Murrumbidgee Uiver. He compared everything  unfavourably with Ohio,  until, down on the river flats. I showed him a crop of maize which reduced him  to civility. He had to get out of the buggy and handle the maize before he  would believe that it was real. Also he said that there was nothing to draw in  this unspeakable stringybark wilderness until we passed an old deserted  wool-shed built of slabs and bark, with a big beam sticking out through the top  as a lever to press the bales. He said that this in itself was worth the trip,  and he spent an hour drawing it, and made an etching which I wish I had now.  Some day, somebody will begin collecting old Australian work, and these little  etchings by Hopkins  will come into their own.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">A &ldquo;Reliability&rdquo; Drive to Melbourne<br>
  Epic of Martyrdom<br>
Back to the High Hills</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AReliabilityDriveToMelbourne"></a>A  &ldquo;Reliability&rdquo; Drive To Melbourne</b></h2>
<p>A  man once went over Niagara Falls  in a barrel and when asked why he did it he said: &ldquo;Well, I was the first to go,  anyhow!&rdquo; This craze for being the first to do anything, even though it may  sometimes be silly, has had important results. When Hargrave was experimenting  with his box kites he was looked upon as an amiable lunatic, and when the  Wright Brothers announced that they had actually flown, few people believed it.  I cannot claim that I was ever the first to do anything, but I saw the  beginnings of a lot of things &mdash; motoring for instance.</p>
<p>I  was a passenger with J. M. Arnott in his car on the first reliability trial  from Sydney to Melbourne, and &ldquo;trial&rdquo; is exactly the right  word. All sorts and conditions of cars competed, and as for the drivers &mdash; they  required to be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>One  elderly enthusiast turned out in a little one-cylinder rubby-dubby, of which he  know so little that his only accessories for the trip were a tack-hammer and a  pair of pincers. Falling to get anyone with experience to accompany him, he had  picked up a Sydney larrikin for company; but  after the first day&rsquo;s drive (from Sydney  to Goulburn) this miscreant deserted him, saying that he preferred dishonour to  death, or words to that effect.</p>
<p>The  elderly driver thereafter spent most of his time on his back under the car, and  finally threw in the towel at Gundagai.</p>
<p>A  French driver named Maillard had taken part in some of the big motor races in France,  and was a hot favourite for the event. He was driving a De Dion, and beat  everybody to Goulburn. On leaving Goulburn he went past the other cars like an  express train, but unfortunately he had no knowledge of Australian roads. He  could not even speak English.</p>
<p>In  those days the roads beyond Goulburn were crossed here and there by steep  gutters to drain off the water.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/3-1.jpg" width="450" height="408"></p>
<p>They  were quite invisible from a distance, and all the experienced drivers had their  passengers standing up on the back seat to yell out &ldquo;gutter&rdquo; when one hove in  sight. The poor little Frenchman, blissfully unconscious of this, hit the first  gutter at fifty miles an hour, sending his car up in the air like a hurdle  horse which has hit a jump. Parts of the car were scattered all over the road  and the Frenchman ran from one to another shouting: &ldquo;Pourquoi les canivaux?&rdquo;  (why are the gutters there?) As I had some sort of Surry Hills knowledge of  French I did my best to explain things, but the only result was to make him cry  worse than ever.</p>
<p>A  Melbourne stock-broker, having his first long drive, had a first class &ldquo;cockatoo&rdquo;  standing up in the back of his car (cockatoos always set a sentinel to look out  for trouble) and did so well between Goulburn and Gundagai that he insisted on  shouting champagne for all the drivers and their associates. Nothing like this  had happened in Gundagai since the big flood and as soon as the word got round  the whole population of the town drifted into the bar and started to lap up  champagne like milk. He drank with all and sundry and did himself so well that  when he left Gundagai next morning the bridge was not wide enough for him and  he hit the abutment fair and square with his radiator. This car, also, became a  casualty; but the owner said that if a man was a sport it was up to him to BE a  sport and he insisted having the car repaired at Gundagai, so that he could  save his face with his friends by finishing the trial even if everybody else  had weighed in and gone home when he arrived.</p>
<p>Sad  to say the local blacksmiths were unequal to a repair job which practically  meant taking the tail light and building a new car onto it. He and his cockatoo  passed us somewhere about Seymour  sitting on the remains of their car in a railway truck, waving bottles and  shouting encouragement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="RuralReactions"></a>Rural  Reactions</b></h2>
<p>Other  drivers were Charley Kellow, once a crack cyclist and, later on, famous as the  owner of Heroic; Harrie Skinner, of Tivoli Theatre fame; and a death-or-glory  boy whose name I cannot remember, but who was out to beat everybody for speed,  and hang the consequences. He was driving a Renault, and, coming to a  partly-opened railway gate, he opened it the rest of the way by hitting it with  his car, thus saving perhaps half a minute but bending his axle. He was the  last to leave and the first to arrive at every control, but he lost the  reliability competition because of his bent axle. He said that he never  expected to win it, anyhow, as he was not using the brand of tyres favoured by  the promoters. We, ourselves, needed no such specious excuse, as we lost our  chance by taking a wrong road near Tarcutta. We did not go 20 yards on the  wrong road; but just to avoid going back those 20 yards we look a short cut  across some long grass, apparently smooth, but it was like the Goulburn Road.</p>
<p>Somebody  had dug a deep drain across it &mdash; a drain hidden by the long grass, like one of  those pits they dig to catch wild animals in in Africa.  Bang went some spokes of a wheel, but there were three perfectly good wheels  left. Some flour-mill mechanics at Albury bolted stout timber supports on to  either side of the wheel, and with many stoppages we got into Melbourne just before the speeches of welcome  were quite finished!</p>
<p>Such  was motoring in those days. Every horse that saw us, kept his tail up and  bolted across country like a wallaby. If attached to a trap, so much the worse  for the trap! At our stoppages en route the rude forefathers of the various  hamlets would come up and put their hands on the radiator, to see whether it  was hot; which it generally was &mdash; sometimes very hot. One of these veterans  made all his following put their pipes out lest the car should blow up. Yet,  the last time that a car stuck me up on that road a twelve-year-old boy got off  a passing cart and put it right! The world moves, even if sometimes in the  wrong directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ComingoftheTrout"></a>Coming of  the Trout</b></h2>
<p>Another  of the novelties which this chronicler met within his time was the first  introduction of rainbow trout to Australia. Among other rivers, the  trout fry were liberated in the Goodradigbee   River. Sufficient time  was allowed them to grow up and then the local inhabitants set about catching  them. A few blackfellows, hanging about the river, used to spend hours fishing  for these trout with cod lines baited with half a parrot. They could see the  trout jumping, but could not induce any of them to bite; and the trout,  generally speaking, were voted a complete washout.</p>
<p>There  was a tradition on this part of the river that a bunyip had once come ashore  once &mdash; something like a calf with whiskers. If there were any truth in the  story it was probably a seal which had found its way up from the mouth of the Murray, but the  black-fellows believed that the bunyip was still in the river, and that it was  eating all the trout which were big enough to bite. Otherwise why couldn&rsquo;t they  catch them?</p>
<p>Then  came the tourists from Sydney, fitted out to beat the band with artificial  flies and spinners; but these people had little better luck than the  blackfellows, for the river was so full of feed that the trout did not bother  themselves to rise at flies when they could get the pupae of dragon flies and  other delicacies without any trouble. Dry-fly purists, and chuck-and-chance-it  fishermen who lowered their flies down the rapids, alike had the poorest of  luck; but they held on in the belief that only a barbarian would use live bait  for trout. Then somebody caught a big haul of trout using grasshoppers for bait  &mdash; but the president of the dry-fly school said that he would sooner use a  fish-trap than a grasshopper. Later on, he was seen by a sheep-musterer on his  hands and knees grabbing at some objects in the grass. Said the sheep-musterer:  &ldquo;Are you ketchin&rsquo; grasshoppers, mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said the dry-fly purist. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking for my knife! I dropped it here  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Believe  it or not, the trout in the southern rivers had an effect on the pastoral  industry in those parts. Owners of small mountain stations, stuck away in  inaccessible places with only a few sheep, were always hard put to it to get  good shearers but when the trout came in the shearers caught the trout-fishing  mania and all sorts of crack shearers &mdash; really great men &mdash; would push out to  these places for the sake of the fishing. One small settler on the Snowy had  only a few sheep and no shearing machines. Meeting a couple of shearers on the  road one day, he suggested that they should come out and shear his sheep for  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  only about 1,500 sheep apiece for you,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;but my wife does the  cookin&rsquo; and you&rsquo;ll have a nice holiday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  there any fishin&rsquo;?&rdquo; was the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, tons of trout. But I ought to tell yer I haven&rsquo;t got machines. We shear  with the blades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  the blades! Why don&rsquo;t you take it off &lsquo;em with a hoe? Never mind, we&rsquo;ll come.  And once we get started you won&rsquo;t be able to sack us &mdash; not while the fish are  bitin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HillBillies"></a>Hill Billies</b></h2>
<p>In  all parts of the world the &ldquo;hill billies&rdquo; are &mdash; well, I won&rsquo;t say greater  thieves &mdash; but they are more enterprising and resourceful than those of the  flat. They have to be, in order to get a living. Walter Scott himself wrote:</p>
<p class="note">Ask  we this barren hill we tread<br>
For fatted steer and household bread?</p>
<p>The  American hill billies who went without boots and lived mostly on plug tobacco  and moonshine liquor were classic examples. We had nothing quite like them in Australia,  but we did the best we could.</p>
<p>By  way of curing some sort of nervous breakdown I found myself for some years a  hill billy, on 40,000 acres, consisting mainly of country that had been left  over after the rest of the world was made.</p>
<p>The  place had a history. It had been taken up in the early days by a man who had no  capital and no station plant except a wheelbarrow. He built himself some sort  of a humpy, got an assigned servant, and set out to build some yards. Yards and  a branding iron were all that they wanted in those days to get a start in life.  Moving the timber for the yards was a problem, but he solved it by hitching  himself on with a sort of harness to the front of the wheelbarrow, while the  assigned servant held up the handles and &ldquo;drove&rdquo; his boss, giving him such  directions as &ldquo;come over to the left a bit,&rdquo; &ldquo;keep away from that gully,&rdquo; &ldquo;look  out the barrow don&rsquo;t run over you down this slope&rdquo; and so on.</p>
<p>After  a time this got on his nerves, and he sold out to a member of the Ryrie family,  who did some real pioneering There were girls in the family, and one of them &mdash;  afterwards known to hundreds and hundreds of patients as Matron Ryrie of The  Terraces hospital &mdash; killed sheep when the men were not at home, and carried all  the water for the house in buckets from the river.</p>
<p>Then  came John MacDonald as next owner, a hardy and determined Scot, who afterwards  became a big financial magnate and breeder of three Derby winners at his Mungie  Bundie stud; but when he was at this mountain place he had little else than a  branding iron and a fixed determination to use it.</p>
<p>The  country was unfenced, and one could ride for miles and miles in the ranges  seeing nothing but wild horses, wild cattle, wombats, and wallaroos, and  hearing at night the chatter of the flying squirrels playing among the gum tree  blossoms. His country bounded on a block taken up by a gentleman named Castles,  of Cavan, at one time a schoolmaster, who had &ldquo;gone bush&rdquo; in the hope of making  some money. Some of Mr. Castles&rsquo;s old pupils, sons of William Lee, who founded  a then priceless stud of Shorthorns, gave Castles some breeding stock &mdash; Lee  bulls and cows.</p>
<p>A  schoolmaster was hardly the man to handle that country. Some of his young bulls  got away, and their stock ran wild, unknown, unbranded, and mixed up with all  sorts of pike-horned scrubbers which had escaped from other people.</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="RetreatfromMoscow"></a>Retreat from  Moscow</b></h2>
<p>All  these unbranded clean-skins were the lawful property of anyone who could yard  them, and MacDonald got them out of the mountains, not in tens and twenties,  but in hundreds. Starting out at daylight with a couple of cattle dogs and a  stockwhip, he took after the wild mobs; and when in after years I asked the  oldest inhabitant whether MacDonald had been a good rider, he said: &ldquo;Well,  nothing out of the ordinary in the buckjumping line, but put him after a  clean-skin and he&rsquo;d show you some class. He&rsquo;d take two or three falls rather  than let a clean-skin get away from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  built trap yards away up in the mountains, sometimes working on by moonlight  after his men had gone to camp and his trap-yards were still there when I took  the place. Unfortunately, by that time, the supply of clean-skins was  exhausted.</p>
<p>It  was to this mountain station that I succeeded when I went back to the bush.</p>
<p>As  a station proposition it was best avoided; as a homestead there was nothing  better. We had eight miles of a trout river, which ran all the year round,  clear and cold in summer, a fierce snow-fed torrent in winter. As the sun was  setting, the lyre-birds came out of their fastnesses and called to each other  across the valley, imitating everything that they had ever heard. Gorgeous  lories came and sat in rows on the spouting that ran round the verandah,  protesting shrilly when their tails were pulled by the children. Bower birds  with an uncanny scent for fruit would come hurrying up from the end of the  garden when the housewife started to peel apples, and would sit on the  window-sill of the kitchen, looking expectantly into the room.</p>
<p>Part  of the run was enclosed by a dingo-proof fence of thirteen wires, with a strand  of barbed wire at top and bottom; and outside of this there were about ten  thousand acres of unfenced country, where one could put sheep when there was  any water, and chance the dingoes coming in from Lobb&rsquo;s Hole.</p>
<p>One  winter they came in when there were a couple of inches of snow on the ground,  and the fiery cross was sent round to the neighbouring stations; for the  presence of a &ldquo;&lsquo;dorg&rdquo; will make the hill people leave all other work and go  after him. We mustered some eight or ten armed men, and as I rode in front on a  cream-coloured mountain pony I happened to look round at the overcoated and  armed figures following me through the snow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where,&rdquo;  I thought, &ldquo;have I seen that picture before!&rdquo; And then I remembered it.  Napoleon&rsquo;s retreat from Moscow!  I, too, retreated from the mountain Moscow,  fortunately with less loss than Napoleon, and resumed city life, not without  regrets.</p>

  How Morant Shot A Padre</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AnExecutionandaRoyalPardon"></a>An Execution  and a Royal Pardon</b></h2>
<p>We  all know how Dreyfus was sentenced to life imprisonment on Devil&rsquo;s   Island and how he was subsequently restored to citizenship; among  other memories of mine is that of the convict Edmund Galley, who was sentenced  to death for murder and afterwards pardoned and compensated. As it so happens,  I knew Galley fairly well&mdash;as well as a young boy could be said to know an old &ldquo;lifer,&rdquo;  and so it may be worth while to relate his story from the Australian end.</p>
<p>I  first met him when I was sent out in a spring cart to take his weekly rations.  As the old song says:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note"><i>&ldquo;Ten pounds of flour, ten pounds of  meat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some sugar, and some tea<br>
  Are all they give to a hungry man to last<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;till the seventh day.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Out  I would go past the Bullock Hill and up Kuryong Creek, through unfenced country  till I saw the bark roof and slab walls of Galley&rsquo;s hut. He was always on the  lookout for the cart&mdash;all the shepherds except the mad ones were on the watch  for the cart on ration day&mdash;and as soon as I hove in sight he would leave his  sheep and come trotting down to the hut.</p>
<p>He  was a little, hard, wiry Englishman, perhaps a provincial of some sort, though  I have no recollection of his using any dialect. On my first visit he looked  hard at me to see whether I could by any possibility be the man who committed  the murder for which he had been sentenced to death. This was his obsession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you come in and have some tea? You&rsquo;re not afraid of me, are ye?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>I  knew nothing about Galley except that he was a sent-out man&mdash;one of the &ldquo;Old  Hands&rdquo;&mdash;so I said that I was not a bit afraid of him.</p>
<p>This  seemed to indicate a lack of appreciation of his importance, so he came out  with his story, all of a rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sent out for life,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sent out for a murder I never done. There&rsquo;s lots  would be afraid of me, I know the man that done it, though I never knew his  right name, &lsquo;Twas a man they called the Kentish Hero. He got lagged for  something else afterwards and he&rsquo;s out here somewhere now, and some day I&rsquo;ll  find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later  on, I used to take Galley&rsquo;s rations to a new hut which he shared with a man  named Howard, who had a wife and some half-dozen children. This mixed menage  seemed to get along well and Galley must have welcomed the change from  solitude; but, one day, there arrived at the homestead a rider on a sweating  horse to say that Howard had been found dead at the foot of a tree with his  skull crushed in and nothing to show how it happened.</p>
<p>Rumour  ran rife round the scattered huts and homesteads that Galley and Howard had had  a quarrel and that this was the result. By the time that the story had got a  good start people had already invented the cause of the quarrel and added all  sorts of picturesque details. The Yass police were called in; and, with Galley&rsquo;s  record at his back, things might have gone hard with him, only that the police  puzzled out the explanation. </p>
<p>Howard  had been ringbarking a tree when he was killed. A large branch of dead timber  was found lying alongside his body. Marks on the tree-trunk showed that this  branch had been leaning against the tree and that the vibration caused by the  ringbarking had made it slip off the tree-trunk, killing Howard with a glancing  blow as it fell. Some of Howard&rsquo;s hair was found on the butt of the branch.</p>
<p>To  try to upset a conviction in those days was like trying to take Gibraltar with a rowing boat, but there must have been a  strong doubt as to the justice of Galley&rsquo;s original conviction. The &ldquo;Exeter  Times&rdquo; (England) took up the  case; members of Parliament brought up the matter in the House of Commons; and  years after the conviction a request was made for testimonials as to his  character in Australia.  These were signed by my father, by Henry Brown, and by Walter Friend, a  brother-in-law of Henry Brown. All were magistrates of the colony, and Walter  Friend and Henry Brown were wealthy and influential men.</p>
<p>Walter  Friend was a hard-headed business man. His name carried weight, and after the  testimonials arrived the Law in England  admitted that it had made a mistake, and issued a Royal pardon to Galley in  1879. The authorities also awarded Galley the sum of a thousand pounds as  compensation for the wrong done him and of this compensation money my father was  made trustee, to administer it at his discretion for Galley&rsquo;s benefit.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="HandsomeAdventurer"></a>Handsome  Adventurer</b></h2>
<p>My  bush upbringing had made me tolerant of the battlers of this world, for, but  for the grace of God, I might have been one myself. Here is a story of a  celebrity with whose career I managed to get mixed up.</p>
<p>In  my mail one morning I found a letter from an uncle of mine, a hard-headed  grazier who had been through the mill; who had been broke and had made a  fortune; and who had accumulated a great knowledge of the ways of the world.</p>
<p>He  wrote: &ldquo;There is a man going down from here to Sydney, and he says he is going to call on  you. His name is Morant. He says he is the son of an English Admiral, and he  has good manners, and education. He can do anything better than most people;  can write verses; break in horses; trap dingoes, yard scrub cattle; dance, run,  fight, drink, and borrow money; anything except work. I don&rsquo;t know what is the  matter with the chap. He seems to be brimming over with flashness, for he will  do any dare-devil thing so long as there is a crowd to watch him. He jumped a  horse over a stiff three-rail fence one dark night by the light of two matches  which he had placed on the posts!&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/4-1.jpg" width="500" height="554"></p>
<p>That  same afternoon a bronzed, clean-shaven man of about thirty, well set up, with  the quick walk of a man used to getting on young horses, clear, confident eyes,  radiating health and vitality, walked into the office and introduced himself as  Morant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  been stopping with your uncle, Arthur Harton,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and when he heard I  was coming to Sydney  he told me to be sure and call on you. Fine man isn&rsquo;t he? He knows me well. He  said if anybody could show me round Sydney  you could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  set things going, so to speak, and the talk drifted from stag-hunting on Exmoor to galloping up alongside wild cattle and ripping  them with a knife, in the scrubs at the back of Dubbo, which, in those days,  was quite far-out country. We had a hunt club in Sydney in those days, and he said that he  must get a horse and come out with us. He talked like a man without a care in  the world. I found myself comparing him with the picturesque heroes of the past  who fought for their own hand. Nowadays we would call him a case for a  psychologist. Yet, he was no Micawber; he did not wait for something to turn  up; he tried to turn it up for himself.</p>
<p>Time  passed on golden wings while we were chatting about the bush, and it was just  on three o&rsquo;clock when he hurriedly looked at his watch. &ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve  enjoyed myself so much talking to you that I forgot I had to cash a cheque. And  now the banks will be shut. Perhaps you could cash a cheque for me for a fiver.  I&rsquo;ve got to pay some bills and I&rsquo;ve run myself clean out of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost  unwillingly I said that I did not have it about me, and suggested that he  should let his creditors wait till the banks opened in the morning. He  dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand, and neither then nor at any other  time did he bear any malice for the refusal.</p>
<p>His  reputation as a daring rider, and his relationship to an admiral, made him a  social lion. Asked to stay with some of our best people, he turned up riding a  pony, with his luggage on the saddle in front of him. This was a great act, and  went over big. He got them to take in the pony for him and borrowed some  clothes from the son of the house who happened to be about his own size. Then a  charity gymkhana was organised, and a buckjumper was wanted to give tone to the  proceedings. Who could provide a buckjumper so well as Mr. Morant? He fairly  lived on buckjumpers away back in his own wilds. He borrowed ten pounds from  the gymkhana committee to pay the expenses of the buckjumper, a celebrated grey  animal which he meant to bring down from Dubbo by rail. This also went over  big, and people flocked to the gymkhana to see the celebrated Morant&rsquo;s  celebrated buckjumper.</p>
<p>Unfortunately  the man who owned the buckjumper knew Morant quite well; and while he was  unwilling to lend his animal to anybody, his unwillingness to lend it to Morant  amounted to an obsession. Did this disconcert our hero? Not a bit of it. He  went out to the saleyards and agreed with a dealer who bought horses by the  carload to break in for him a grey horse, one of a truckload; and this horse  (as it turned out) knew no more about buckjumping than it knew about the  Einstein theory. The animal&rsquo;s performance at the gymkhana was such a &ldquo;flop&rdquo;  that the committee squealed like anything about their ten pounds, and said that  they were going to stick to the grey horse until they got their money back. A  fair enough proposition, until the owner of the so-called buckjumper turned up  and offered to give the secretary of the gymkhana a lift under the ear if he  did not give the animal back.</p>
<p>After  this, our hero&rsquo;s reception at his temporary home was anything but enthusiastic,  but, with his queer flair for theatricalism, he managed to make an exit with a  certain amount of glory. He said that he was called away suddenly to  Queensland, to inspect a station, and as they had treated him so well he wished  to present the son of the house with the pony which would be of no further use  to him. He would take no denial, and he handed over the pony with a sort of  Arab&rsquo;s farewell to his steed&mdash;a touching scene which lingered in their memories  till the owner of the pony cast up and took it away, saying that he had paid  Morant a couple of pounds to quieten it for a little girl!</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/Morant.jpg" width="450" height="550"></p>
<p>Such  was the man who was shot by the British Army after a court-martial for defying  Army orders and shooting a prisoner in revenge for the death of one of his best  friends. I happened to know all that was to be known about Morant&rsquo;s trial and  execution, for the lawyer who defended him, one J. F. Thomas, of Tenterfield,  asked me to publish all the papers&mdash;evidence, cablegrams, decision, appeal,  etc.,&mdash;a bulky bundle which he carried about with him, grieving over the matter  till it seriously affected his mind. He blamed himself, in a measure, for the  death of Morant, but I could not see that he had failed to do the best he could  with a very unpleasant business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ExecutionofMorant"></a>Execution of  Morant</b></h2>
<p>This  was the story of the Morant affair, told me by Thomas, and confirmed by  reference to his bundle of papers:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morant,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;was detached from his own command in South Africa, and was acting under  the orders of a civilian official named Taylor, who knew the country and had  been appointed by the Army to go round the out-lying farms requisitioning  cattle. They knew that Morant was a good hand with cattle, so that was how he  was put on the job. He had a few men under him, and pretty well a free hand in  anything he did. They had to keep their eyes open, for wandering bands of the  enemy used sometimes to have a shot at them, and in one of these skirmishes a  mate of Morant was killed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morant  told me,&rdquo; said Thomas, &ldquo;that he had orders not to let all and sundry wander  about the country without proper permits. He questioned a man who was driving  across country in a Cape cart on some business  or other. According to Morant, he thought that this man was acting as a spy. It  so happened that Morant had just seen the body of his mate and claimed that it  had been disfigured; that somebody had trodden on the face. Of course,  everybody was excited, not knowing when there might be another skirmish. Morant  told his men that he had orders to shoot anybody in reprisal for a murder or  for disfiguring the dead or for spying. So he took this man out of his Cape cart and shot him! Unfortunately, the victim turned  out to be a Dutch padre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somehow,  I seemed to see the whole thing &mdash; the little group of anxious-faced men, the  half-comprehending Dutchman standing by, and Morant, drunk with his one day of  power. For years he had shifted and battled and contrived; had been always the  under-dog, and now he was up in the stirrups. It went to his head like wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morant  was sentenced to death,&rdquo; Thomas said, &ldquo;but I never believed the execution would  be carried out. When I found that the thing was serious I pulled every string I  could; got permission to wire to Australia, and asked for the case  to be reopened so that I might put in a proper defence. It was of no use.  Morant had to go. He died game. But I wake up in the night now, feeling that  Morant must have believed that he had some authority for what he did and that I  ought to have been able to convince the Court of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor  Thomas! He died years ago, and has taken his troubles to a Higher Tribunal.</p>
<p class="note">[Note.&mdash;Mr.  F. M. Cutlack writes: One takes a man as he finds him in this life, especially  in the bush, but as one who knew Harry Harbord Morant well and  affectionately&mdash;adventurer as he was&mdash;I deplore that &ldquo;Banjo&rdquo; Paterson does not  even remember his universally known nickname of &ldquo;The Breaker,&rdquo; the name with  which for years he signed his verses in &ldquo;The Bulletin.&rdquo; Perhaps he deceived  some people, and left them angry, but he was known in all the back country from  Queensland to the Lower Murray, and great numbers of other people of careless  habits&mdash;or even of some scrupulous rectitude&mdash;loved him despite his faults. A  great cry of protest went up when he was shot&mdash;reprieved too late we heard, by  Kitchener&mdash;and when I last saw it, in 1913, his grave was the greenest in  Pretoria Cemetery, and so kept by an Australian committee. His Boer War story  is told in &ldquo;Scapegoats of Empire,&rdquo; by Lieutenant Witton, one of those  court-martialled with him, and also in a smaller volume, &ldquo;Bush-veldt and  Buccaneer,&rdquo; written under a pen-name by Frank Fox, then of the &ldquo;Bulletin&rdquo;  staff.]</p>

  New Hebrides Venture<br>
A Magnificent Failure</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="PoliticalGiantsAndPilgrimFathers"></a>Political  Giants And &ldquo;Pilgrim Fathers&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>In  this casual chronicle it is impossible to give more than a sort of thumbnail  sketch of some celebrities who strutted their hour upon the stage. Plutarch, in  his &ldquo;Lives,&rdquo; did not disdain personal details; in fact, it was the details  which made the &ldquo;Lives&rdquo; such a success. Here goes, then, to follow far behind  Plutarch&rsquo;s tracks, deeply imprinted as they are in the soil of time.</p>
<p>With  whom shall we begin? Sir Henry Parkes and Sir John Robertson stand out like  lighthouses of the past. It so happened that I came in personal contact with  these two great men, getting a sort of worm&rsquo;s eye view of them, and of their  activities.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="2100401h-images/Sir-Henry-Parkes.jpg" width="472" height="580"></p>
<p>Sir  Henry Parkes, with his mane of silvery hair and his Nestorian beard, adopted  the role of the aloof potentate; in the argot of the prize-ring, he let the  other fellow do the loading, and then countered him heavily. It is said that a  field-marshal in war cannot afford to have any friends, and Parkes was a  field-marshal, plus. Not but what he could relax on occasion, but always in an  aloof, Jupiterish sort of way. I remember seeing him at a public dinner when  the waiter poured him out a glass of champagne from a full bottle, and then  moved off with it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave  that bottle,&rdquo; said the statesman, who always got the temperance vote. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  finish that and probably another one after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man never had any money, though goodness knows he had opportunities enough  of getting it &ldquo;on the side&rdquo; had he been so minded. On various occasions he came  into the lawyer&rsquo;s office where I was employed, always full of dignity, in a  frock coat and a tall hat, to discuss his pecuniary complications. But personal  finance bored him. He despised money; he was Sir Henry Parkes.</p>
<p>Sir  John Robertson was also silver-haired and Nestorian-bearded but he was by  nature what the Americans call a &ldquo;mixer,&rdquo; prone to sit for hours in clubs or  pubs entertaining his cronies; in fact, anybody could be his crony who was  found linguistically worthy. He, too had a rough ride over the financial rocks.</p>
<p>In  the gloomy days just before the banks shut I was told by one of them to write  Sir John what the bank called &ldquo;a nice firm letter&rdquo; requesting the payment of  some money. The old man came in, ran his eye over the office and asked, through  his nose: &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s looking after the affairs of this English, Scottish,  Continental, Japanese, Australian . . . Bank?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  said that I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  you tell them not to write me any more d&mdash;d silly letters,&rdquo; and with that he  went off to the club.</p>
<p>The  bank asked what reply Sir John had made to the nice firm letter, and I said  that he had given a nice firm answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="SolidityPreferred"></a>Solidity  Preferred</b></h2>
<p>Then  there was Jim MacGowan who was (I think) the first Labour Premier &mdash; a  serious-minded man, a Sunday school teacher, and with enough personal magnetism  to hold his inexperienced team together.</p>
<p>The  Labour people in those days preferred solid leaders like MacGowan and J. C.  Watson (who had been an &ldquo;Evening News&rdquo; compositor) to the Dantons and  Robespierres and fiery Ruperts of debate. Not but what some of them had their  human side. Donald MacDonell, a shearer, after whom MacDonell House is named,  came back from an election campaign so hoarse that he could hardly speak. I  asked him how the election was going.</p>
<p>He  put his mouth close to my ear, and I thought I was going to hear some important  political secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind the (adjective) election,&rdquo; he cloaked, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s going to win the Doncaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  think, if I may say so, that there was a lighter touch, more of the rapier and  less of the bludgeon about political controversy in those days.</p>
<p>When  Graham Berry, Premier of Victoria, appointed himself a delegate to the Home  Office to get some amendment of the Constitution, did his enemies assail him  with vituperation? Not at all. They hired a Yarra bank orator, a black man, to  whose surname of &ldquo;Henderson&rdquo; they added the affix &ldquo;Africanus&rdquo; to give him some  dignity &mdash; and sent him home in the same ship with Graham Berry to burlesque the  show! Unfortunately, &ldquo;Henderson Africanus&rdquo; was blocked somewhere in America, and London missed an historical comedy, if there  is such a thing. A pity, too, for it was said of &ldquo;Henderson Africanus&rdquo; that he  could talk the hind leg off a horse.</p>
<p>Sir  George Reid and Sir Edmund Barton were latter-day successors to Parkes and  Robertson &mdash; Barton all strength and solidity; Reid all repartee and tu quoque.</p>
<p>I  saw Reid as a comparatively young man addressing a temperance meeting on behalf  of the publicans, pleading for fair play. The temperance people, of course,  gave him the &ldquo;raspberry&rdquo; and other unseemly noises with some spirited hissing.  In a moment of quiet he said: &ldquo;I came here to answer your arguments, but all I  can hear is the ginger-beer bubbling in your brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  all his readiness in speech he was slow to come to a decision. When the kanaka  question came up for settlement one way or the other, kanaka or no kanaka,  Barton declared himself against the kanakas, but in favour of giving the  sugar-growers time to get rid of them. It so happened that I went up in the  train with Sir George Reid when he had to declare his policy in Brisbane. There were other  Pressmen on the train, and in the intervals of sleeping and eating lollies he  put us through a cross examination as to the views of our editors on sugar.  After a while the senior reporter drew me aside and said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hardly  believe it, but George doesn&rsquo;t know what he is going to say.&rdquo; Sure enough, in  his speech he refused to give any decision, but said that he would go up and  see the sugar country for himself.</p>
<p>This  drew from some Bull of Bashan at the back a roar of, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother to do that  George. They&rsquo;ll send the sugar to you in Sydney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  qualified for first place in any &ldquo;nasty remarks&rdquo; competition; and Australia  remained white when there was every indication of its going black.</p>
<p>I  mention this because it was one of the crises of our history.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ReadingandWriting"></a>Reading</b><b> and Writing</b></h2>
<p>As  these are personal reminiscences I suppose I may be allowed to bore people with  some of my experiences in reading and writing.</p>
<p>Looking  over the shoulders of the young men of to-day, in trams, I find that they are  mostly reading serious literature and high-brow stuff, while the elders are  poring over love stories and sensational detective yarns, trying, perhaps, to  recapture the past. The more things change the more they are the same. In our  day, too, we young men read all the &ldquo;improving&rdquo; books we could get.</p>
<p>Henry  George, an American compositor and apostle of the single tax, had a tremendous  following, and when he came out to Australia we rolled up in thousands  to hear him debate against a barrister named Rose. I can remember to this day  the magnificent domed forehead of Henry George, gleaming under the gaslight. He  was in deadly earnest, but his opponent had been platform grappling from  boyhood, and threw punches from all sorts of unexpected directions &mdash; punches  which disconcerted the philosopher.</p>
<p>Dropping  Henry George, someone put me on to another hard one in Thomas Carlyle, and in  Carlyle&rsquo;s &ldquo;Past and Present&rdquo; I thought I had found a workable formula for  saving the world.</p>
<p>Briefly  put, his argument was that men are quite unfit to govern themselves, and that  their only hope lies in finding the right leader. Experience later on inclined  me to think that there might be something in his theory. Impressionable as I  was at the time, I heard a big Government contractor say that if six hundred men  were left leaderless on any job two hundred of them would go off after women,  two hundred after strong drink, while the spiritless remainder would go on with  the job! A very great man, this Carlyle, but there is a difficulty in  convincing the world that it is unfit to govern itself. I read so much of his  work that I can write fairly good Carlyle myself on occasion. For instance, how  about this: &ldquo;Consider man, insignificant insect, around him looms the universe,  lurid, lit by lightnings; beneath him waits the Old Boy, expectant,  disillusioned; and were man but worthy to know it, his destiny lies in the  stars&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Writing,  too &mdash; what are we to say about writing ?</p>
<p>A  man may have the luck to light on a line of his own &mdash; such as rough Australian  verse &mdash; and get away with it. Failing this, the would-be writer has to go up  against Shakespeare and Alexandre Dumas, which is like trying to take Gibraltar with a rowing boat.</p>
<p>Journalism,  too, is like literature &mdash; everybody is at it. In certain universities they have  schools of journalism; but without feeling particularly certain about anything  I am inclined to think that the world will have little time for the  machine-made journalist. The world wants the choice cuts in journalism, even  though the butcher use his cleaver somewhat roughly.</p>
<p>For  this reason I say nothing about wars, though I was in three of them as a  spectator, and in one as an officer in the remount service.</p>
<p>The  war is by now a ten-times-told tale, and there is little left to be said unless  by a Lloyd George, who could have won the war in no time had it not been for  the infernal Generals!</p>
<p>Apart  from such studious activities, I once came very near being an Empire builder &mdash;  if I had had any luck.</p>
<p>James  Burns, or perhaps I had better give him his proper title, Colonel the  Honourable Sir James Burns, of the firm of Burns, Philp and Co., was, at all  events, as near to the Empire builder as we ever saw in these parts.</p>
<p>A  thin and austere Scotsman of the old son-of-the-manse type, few people would  have taken him for what he was &mdash; an outstanding financial genius. The great O&rsquo;Sullivan  might toss millions about with the abandon of an elephant throwing hay; but  James Burns risked his company&rsquo;s money, and his own, in ventures which required  a lot of pluck and a lot of foresight. They were merchants, ship-owners, island  traders, and graziers; putting the firm&rsquo;s money behind settlers away up on the  Queensland rivers where they were liable to be scuppered by blacks at any time;  financing storekeepers in little one-pub towns, where these storekeepers found  grubstakes for prospectors and miners; sending their vessels to the islands  where no boat&rsquo;s crew dared land unless the bow-man had a loaded rifle; running  small steamers to places where there were no wharves, and the boat just tied up  alongside the bank. Anywhere that there was a risk to be run and money to be  made you would see the flag of James Burns. If he had been dealing in diamonds,  instead of copra and bananas, he might have been another Cecil Rhodes.</p>
<p>I  was sent by the &ldquo;Sydney Morning Herald&rdquo; to accompany a mob of Australian  settlers which Sir James was sending to colonise the New   Hebrides. A sort of Pilgrim Fathers affair, this, the settlers  going down to live among wild savages in the land of the golden cocoanut. I  found &ldquo;Cecil Rhodes&rsquo;s&rdquo; under-study in his office and he gave me the plan of  operations.</p>
<p>He  said that his firm had bought thousands of acres in the New   Hebrides. &ldquo;Some,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we bought from the old Scotch company  which lost a lot of money in the islands and sold out to us; other areas we  bought from native chiefs, traders, and so on. Now the French have gone down  there, and we may have to fight for our land. The Scotch company areas should  be all right as they were taken up and occupied before the French made any  claim, but where we bought, say, a thousand acres from a native chief the  French are now claiming that they bought the same land from the same chief or  that they bought the same land from another chief who had a better right to it.  Nothing can be settled till a Court is appointed to confirm the titles. We are  sending these settlers down there so that, when a Court does sit we will have  men on the spot in possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  promised some adventure.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheArgonauts"></a>The  Argonauts</b></h2>
<p>Soon  I was at sea with the Australian Pilgrim Fathers in search of the land of the  golden cocoanut. This was not a bad ship, except that at some time or other she  had tried to shift a coral reef and had got a sort of kink in her keel. The captain,  a gigantic New Zealander, said she was inclined to steer a bit north by south  unless carefully watched! &ldquo;If you let her alone,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;she will go round  and round in circles; but she&rsquo;s quite good enough for a trade where, any dark  night, you might walk her right up on to a reef which has risen out of the sea  since the last time you were along. There&rsquo;s a volcano on Ambrym &mdash; you&rsquo;ll see  that &mdash; and I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, any night, to see fire and a new island  coming up out of the sea. We&rsquo;ve got the missionaries on board; it&rsquo;s their synod  trip. They&rsquo;re good, well-meaning chaps, nearly all doctors, who do a lot for  the niggers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  the niggers dangerous?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  were until they got rifles. They could not hit a barn with a rifle if you put &rsquo;em  inside it. If they want to kill a man they hide in the jungle and knock him  with a waddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  made friends with the settlers and found&nbsp;  they were the genuine article &mdash; hard-handed, anxious-faced men, miners,  farmers, shearers, mechanics &mdash; all off to tackle a job of which they knew  little in a land of which they knew less. Many of them were born adventurers  who would start off anywhere at the drop of a hat, just for the sake of seeing  something new. I fancy there must have been some of this sort with the original  American Pilgrim Fathers.</p>
<p>Leaving  Lord Howe we hit the real tropics and began to have adventure. A lady passenger  came aboard at Norfolk Island and went almost  straight to the ladies&rsquo; bathroom. The ship had been fumigated for cockroaches  before leaving Sydney,  and the cockroaches, opposing instinct to science, had crawled into the tap of  the bath. When she turned on the water she got a stream of cockroaches, all in  the highest health and spirits. They fled in various directions, drying their  whiskers as they went. It was just a first taste of the tropics, a prelude to  the performances of the tree-climbing crab and the cocoanut-eating rat, the  lawyer vine, and the stinging tree.</p>
<p>Here,  too, the Pilgrim Fathers got the first taste of what was ahead of them. They hired  horses and went riding inland, where they saw Norfolk   Island pines, and loquats, and bananas, and oranges, growing wild.  Round the homesteads they saw kumeras (yams), sweet potatoes, coffee, fowls,  ducks, pigeons, pigs, and cattle.</p>
<p>Our  settlers had a sort of Parliament in perpetual session, comparing notes and  experiences, quoting from pamphlets and political reports, in none of which  they had any faith. Someone mentioned the humidity of the climate, which  brought forward a man who had been sleeper-cutting on the Johnstone River.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  ain&rsquo;t afraid of the humidity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I stood the Johnstone River  for two years. We used to wrap our matches in flannel and put them in a little  bottle. Then we&rsquo;d wrap that bottle in flannel and put it in a pickle bottle.  Then we&rsquo;d put the pickle bottle inside our coats, and then the matches would be  wet. Bring on your humidity!&rdquo;</p>
<p>What  in the end stopped the development of the scheme? Simply that the French and  English Governments waited to see what would turn up before authorising any  decision about the land. Some of the settlers went on with their work but were  met with tariffs, while their French neighbours were encouraged with bonuses!  That was the end of a glorious undertaking</p>
