  <h2 align="center"><b>Preface</b></h2>
  <p>In  the limits of a pamphlet it is impossible to put any argument thoroughly. I  have had to leave unanswered, for want of space, many arguments which will be  raised against my views: I have had to leave unmentioned many facts which  support my views. These matters I hope to deal with some day in a more extended  manner.<br>

    The Need Of Reform</b></h2>
  <p>It  is of the greatest importance to every man amongst us that he should have some  clear idea of what position he occupies in relation to other people, and that  he should understand what it is that fixes his prospects, and circumstances in  life. It is not too much to say that this is the most important question which  any man can have to consider; but it is astonishing how few give any attention to  such matters. On coming to years of discretion, each man adopts that trade,  profession, or business to which circumstances seem to point: the clerk goes to  his desk, the workman to his tools, the architect to his plans, the lawyer to  his books &mdash; each plods along to the day of his death, obtaining as well as may  be the market value for his work, but never enquiring how that market value is  arrived at. The capitalist finds that interest on his money is obtainable at a  certain rate, and he too grumbles that he cannot get larger interest on safe  investments; but he never makes any investigation into the causes which  determine the rate of interest, and its rise or fall. The young man beginning  life finds that there is &ldquo;no good opening,&rdquo; but it never occurs to him to ask  why there is &ldquo;no good opening;&rdquo; he creeps into the first vacancy he can see,  and adapts himself to circumstances.</p>
  <p>Every  man is more or less a &ldquo;politician,&rdquo; and will spout by the hour about freetrade  and protection, but men seem to treat political matters rather as abstract  theories than as things of practical importance to themselves. The difference  between freetrade and protection, etc., is not the difference between one set  of politicians and another; it is a question of which is the best for us as a  community, and as individuals.</p>
  <p>It  is the purpose of this pamphlet to present a brief summary of the principles  which govern the prosperity of individuals and nations; and to show that there  might be, amongst us Australians, much greater all round individual prosperity  and wealth than there is: that we might all be much better off than we are:  that it is possible for men with willing hands and brains to obtain the means  to live in comfort and comparative affluence, much more easily and certainly  than can be done now. Which desirable results can only be obtained by good  laws.</p>
  <p>It  may appear at first sight that this is a personal and selfish rather than a  national matter, and that the title of this book is hardly appropriate in such  a connection; but the fact is that the only way to improve the welfare and  prosperity of the country at large, is to improve the individual welfare and  prosperity of the inhabitants. To advance Australia we must advance the  Australians, and the question of individual advancement is really the question  of the greatest national importance.</p>
  <p>It  may be said that we are already the most prosperous country in the world; that  in no other place can a good living be got so easily and certainly as it can  here. Even if we grant this, it does not prove that we are as prosperous as we  might be, or as we have every right to expect to be. And when we come to look  into the matter we find that we are a very long way from any such happy state.  It ought to be possible in a new country like this for every man with a willing  pair of hands to be always employed, and at good wages. There should be  constant openings for our young men with brains and ability to make good  incomes. Poverty and enforced idleness of willing men should be unknown. Yet we  find the working men constantly seeking employment in vain. There seem to be  less and less openings or chances for the young men who are coming forward. In  all the colonies an absurd proportion of the population is crowding into the  towns. The professions are overcrowded.</p>
  <p>In  the year 1888 New South Wales  paid over one hundred thousand pounds for the support of men who could get  nothing to do. The trouble is temporarily disposed of, but will certainly crop  up again. It is a curious thing that in a partially settled country we find one  colony paying over one hundred thousand pounds in a year towards charity works,  for those who can find nothing to do. Why should there be any unemployed at all?  Surely there is work enough to be done, land enough lying idle, desires enough  to be satisfied.</p>
  <p>It  is often alleged by people, especially of the &ldquo;upper&rdquo; classes, that our  labouring population are a great deal too well off. &ldquo;They are getting too  independent altogether, these fellows with their eight hours and their  holidays; the colony will never go ahead until we get cheap reliable labor.&rdquo;  This idea is founded on a hideous ignorance of the most simple rules of  political economy. Cheap labour means degradation of the community, and no  country has ever been prosperous or happy by reason of labour being cheap; but  the exact contrary has always been the case. High wages have everywhere and  always meant prosperity, and low wages have always meant bad times.</p>
  <p>Let  those who do not see the necessity for any change or questioning of the present  arrangement of affairs, take a night walk round the poorer quarters of any of  our large colonial cities, and they will see such things as they will never  forget. They will see vice and sin and misery in full development. They will  see poor people herding in wretched little shanties, the tiny stuffy rooms  fairly reeking like ovens with the heat of our tropical summer. I, the writer  of this book, at one time proposed, in search of novelty, to go and live for a  space in one of the lower class lodging-houses in Sydney, to see what life was like under that  aspect. I had &ldquo;roughed it&rdquo; in the bush a good deal. I had camped out with very  little shelter and very little food. I had lived with the stockmen in their  huts, on their fare, so I was not likely to be dainty; but after one night&rsquo;s  experience of that lodging I dared not try a second. To the frightful  discomfort was added the serious danger of disease from the filthy surroundings  and the unhealthy atmosphere. I fled. And yet what I, a strong man, dared not  undertake for a week, women and children have to go through from year&rsquo;s end to  year&rsquo;s end. And there were places compared with which the one I tried was a  paradise.</p>
  <p>Some  say of course that all this misery is the fault of the people themselves; in  some cases it is. There are people who would be hard up, no matter what chances  they got; but there are a great many who, try as they may, cannot make any  comfortable kind of a living. Do you, reader, believe that it is an inevitable  law that in a wealthy country like this we must have so much poverty? Do you  not think there must be something wrong somewhere? Of course people are much  worse off in the older countries. God grant that we never will reach the awful  state in which the poorer classes of England and the Continent now are.  Are we not going in the same direction? That is the question which we have to  consider. The same trouble is showing itself here which has come up everywhere.  Instead of the position of the working people improving at the same rate as the  various appliances for getting a living are improved and perfected, we find a  woeful deficiency. The improvement in productive power has been like the speed  of a racehorse, while the improvement in the position of the people who ought  to be benefited thereby has been like the speed of the mud turtle,&mdash;if indeed  any progress has been made at all.</p>
  <p>If  it be a fact that there is no help for this, and that it is an absolute  necessity that there should be unemployed and paupers, it is a serious matter  for us all, because there is no hard and fast line dividing one class of  workman from another. All who work, whether by hand or brain, are equally  working for their living, and if that living is becoming harder to get it is no  joke for us. We who have no pressing cares, look with indifference on the  hardships of poverty-stricken people; but it may be our turn next. It is a  matter we should look into. The accepted theory to explain all this is one  which was started by a clergyman named Malthus. He said that people had to  slave day and night, and women and little children had to suffer hunger and  want, because the earth would not produce enough to support its population. He  said that just in the same way if a man kept on breeding sheep he would in time  overstock his run, so we human creatures tend to increase and multiply so  rapidly that we would overstock the earth, were it not that our numbers are  kept down by starvation, disease, dirt, misery, and all the evil consequences  which follow on and spring from poverty. Nine men out of every ten you meet  subscribe unthinkingly to this theory. They will say if asked&mdash;&ldquo;There must  always be poor people, because there isn&rsquo;t enough to go round.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  is hard to see how any one who believes in religion, who believes in a God of  justice and mercy, can believe this theory &mdash; will for a moment believe that God  puts people on the earth just to starve them off it again.</p>
  <p>This  over-population theory, curiously enough, is accepted by a people to whom it  certainly does not apply, and who never learnt it from Malthus. The howling  black savages of the interior of this continent are true Malthusians; they  believe in applying a positive check to the increase of population, so they  operate in a crude, but effective way, on the female infants, and render them  incapable of ever bearing children. They do this to relieve the pressure of  population on subsistence, in a wonderfully fertile country where the  population is about one nigger to the square league. In their view, the  carrying power of the earth is limited to the number of wild ducks, tree grubs,  lizards, and snakes that it will furnish. Having arrived at this conclusion,  they lie on their backs in the sun all day, and curse Creation for not having  provided them with more food. They endorse fully the sentiment of John Stuart  Mill, that it is not the laziness of man but the niggardliness of Nature which  is to blame for the privations which they occasionally endure.</p>
  <p>Whether  this Malthusian theory be true or not is luckily not a matter which we need  consider; there can be no question but that our country will support all the  population it has now, or is likely to have for the next few centuries.</p>
  <p>It  is difficult to imagine a number of people so great that our country could not  carry them. When we think of the great rolling fertile plains of this  continent, the wonderfully rich river flats, and the miles and thousands of  miles of agricultural land, spreading all over the country and hardly yet  trodden by man, it is very evident that pressure of population on subsistence  has nothing whatever to do with our difficulties.</p>
  <p>It  can, I believe, be shown that the supplies of heat in the sun will in time give  out; that the earth will grow cold and lifeless, and will stop turning round  and round, and I suppose it could be proved that the earth will some day be  overstocked &mdash; but all these things are a long way off. Are we going to give  ourselves up as lost, and to make no effort to put things straight, because at  some very remote period there may not be enough subsistence to keep everybody  alive? We would indeed be chicken-hearted to give way to such opinion.</p>
  <p>It  is generally alleged that these ideas of a better state of things are visionary  and unrealisable. If it is the dream of a visionary, that in a new country like  this, where we have the most fertile soil and the greatest natural resources of  all kinds; where we can grow anything we want and make all things we need for  ourselves, or get them by exchange from the older countries: if it is the dream  of a visionary that in such a country every man might be comfortably off, and  might get a living easily, certainly, and with a large amount of leisure, then  God help the people of such a country. They deserve to have it taken from them  and given back to the blacks.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</b><br>
  <b>The System of Production </b></h2>
<p>It  must always be remembered that we are dealing here with the simple question  whether we can, by any means, be enabled to make a better living. We are not  concerning ourselves with the theoretical or imaginative part of life at all.  We are simply investigating the supply and demand of bread and butter. We look  upon the object of life as being to get the best possible living. We live and  work that we may have good clothes to wear, good food to eat, may enjoy the  luxuries of life, may go to the theatre on occasions, may take our leisure when  we wish it, may help those in need, patronise our friends, and insult our  enemies; and that when we die we may leave a good name and a fair amount of  money to our posterity, and depart &ldquo;over the border&rdquo; with a decent share of  good deeds to our credit in the great ledger.</p>
<p>As  Bastiat puts it, the rule is that man shall eat bread in the sweat of his brow,  and the object of us all is to get the greatest possible amount of bread for  the least possible amount of sweat. We estimate our wealth in money, but money  is only valuable for the things it will buy; it is a medium of exchange; paper  makes just as good money as gold; a bank note for a pound will buy just as much  in any Australian city as a sovereign. When we say, therefore, that we work for  money, we mean that we work for the things which money will buy&mdash;for the  desirable things of this life which we may lump under the name of &ldquo;wealth,&rdquo;  meaning not money, but articles of value. Now we have to consider what are  these desirable things, and how are they obtained?</p>
<p>Everything  which we have, or desire to have, is produced by the earth in some crude form  or other, and is worked up by human labour into the shape in which we use it. A  carriage is simply a hickory tree, and other trees, cut into shape, and bound  together with iron ore which has been smelted and refined. A suit of clothes is  wool from the sheep twisted into shape by intricate machinery, which machinery  is also iron and other ores refined and properly treated, and put in proper  shape. Everything we have comes from the earth; there is no other wealth; there  is no other source of supply. Manna does not drop from heaven in these days.  The next thing is to try and find out the system, if any, on which we set to  work to make these things. Once we can find the basis, the system of the thing,  we will have made a good start.</p>
<p>The  reader no doubt has been used to hear a good deal of talk about productive and  unproductive labour; about producer and consumer; about supply and demand;  about scarcity and over production; everything seems mixed up, and there  appears to be no system whatever. One thing, however, is clear, namely, that no  one gets a living for nothing. We hear about unproductive labourers, consumers,  and so on. What is an unproductive consumer? A mere mouth and belly,  apparently, which other men supply with food. There is no law whereby such  people are maintained, and as a matter of fact every one except absolute  paupers does something, or gives something for a living. No one is an  unproductive consumer; everyone helps in some way in the production of wealth.  The Governor of the colony draws a salary. Why? Because he does his share in  the work of keeping order, protecting the people, and managing the affairs of  the State. Such share, perhaps, as we might easily get done at less cost, but  such as we have fixed at our own valuation. Your services, we say, are worth so  many thousands a year&mdash;here are your wages. In the same way, through all classes  of the people, all are doing their share in production of wealth.</p>
<p>There  are men who do not actually make, out of the produce of the earth, by applying  their labour, any tangible article of wealth; they do not themselves produce  any wealth, but they assist those who do. If we were all like working bullocks,  desiring grass and water, and grass and water only, then we might well look  upon any one, who devoted his energies to any object other than the attainment  of grass and water, as a supernumerary and an unproductive consumer. If we  could do our work without amusement, without recreation, without pleasure to  the eye and gratification of the senses, then might we dispense with all &ldquo;unproductive&rdquo;  labourers. We might all dress in moleskins and flannel shirts, and if we did we  might look upon people who wove silk fabrics as unproductive and wasters. But  our natures are different from this; we need rest, recreation and amusement; we  desire to have pretty things as well as merely useful ones, and we have higher  needs than eating and drinking. For instance, actors and singers help us in our  work by lightening our minds and stirring up our mirth, so that we go on our  way more cheerful and contented. They themselves produce nothing, but they help  us so that we produce the more. We pay them their &ldquo;wages,&rdquo; holding them to have  given us an equivalent. Each does his share, and if we seek to weed out those  whose labour might be dispensed with, where will we draw the line? Not until we  have dispensed with everything except the plainest clothes, and the coarsest  food, and the poorest shelter compatible with health.</p>
<p>A  civilized man does not choose to live under these conditions, and the result is  that many of us devote ourselves to labour that might be dispensed with, if we  were all to become anchorites; the principle remains the same, namely, that we  are all working for the desired wealth. We merely extend the meaning of wealth  from necessary things to desirable things.</p>
<p>We  can see, therefore, that all labour tends to the same end, and we should not  allow the intricate subdivision of labour to blind our eyes to the great  central fundamental fact,<i> that we are all  working for the best living we can get; that such living can only be got out of  the earth and its products, and that we are all engaged, more or less directly,  in obtaining and improving those products for our use</i>.</p>
<p>This  is the object of work; but besides the men who get their living by their work,  there are some that don&rsquo;t work, and still get a living: how do we classify  these? We have said that there is no law whereby a man gets his living for  nothing, and the reader will find it very easy to define the position of the  non-workers. They either own land and live on the rent of it, or they own  capital and live on the interest of it. The brainless English new chum who  comes out here with &pound;5,000 to invest, does his share in the aggregate  production by lending his capital.</p>
<p>These  are the three factors of production of wealth:&mdash; land, labour, and capital.  Production is carried on by these three factors and by nothing outside of them.  If a man gets a living at all, he gets it by working for it, or by using his  own money, or letting other people use it; or by using his own land, or letting  other people use it.</p>
<p>To  hear the current speakers and read the current books on this subject, one would  think that, as each man came of age, he was ear-marked and branded by Providence, one  &ldquo;capitalist,&rdquo; another &ldquo;landlord,&rdquo; another &ldquo;labourer,&rdquo; and that they were then  turned loose into the world to war on one another. This is not the right way to  look at it. There is no hard and fast distinction between different classes of  men, and the troubles that continually come up are due to mistakes, and  ignorance of the great social principles which govern such things.</p>
<p>This,  then, is the system of our social life: We have, the Australians, a nation  possessing one of the finest countries in the world, amply supplied with  capital, or stored up wealth, of their own and older countries. Their object  being to get the best living they can out of their country, they divide  themselves into an infinity of trades, professions, and businesses, ranging  from those who directly till the soil and tend the herds, up to the most  elevated officials of government. Capital is easily available for any productive  enterprise. Land is plenty. There is (theoretically) no restriction whatever on  the method in which they employ themselves. Every man can go to the thing which  he thinks will pay him best. If this system were worked properly, it is the  best possible system, being the simplest. Under such a system one should expect  to get the best possible results.</p>
<p>We  would expect that no one would be idle until every want was satisfied, and  there was nothing left to be done. So long as there are bare backs to clothe in  the old country, so long as they want leather, minerals, and all the raw  products of our land, it surely must pay us to go on exchanging with them,  sending them the raw material and getting back manufactured goods; so long as  any other land wants our goods, and is willing and able to give us in exchange  for them such things as we want, it surely should be possible for us all to get  a good living by going to work and exchanging with them. We have so much land,  and so few people. If they could not, or would not, exchange with us, we could  isolate ourselves if we liked, and still make a splendid living by &ldquo;manufacturing,&rdquo; <i>i.e</i>., improving our own raw material  for our own benefit. Either way, we ought to be able to get the best living  that our capabilities will allow; whereas we are not using half our natural  opportunities, and rich land is lying idle half a mile from towns where men are  sitting idle, or only half occupied, at professions for which there is little  demand, and trades in which employment is slack. To any one who understands the  system of production, the way in which our inhabitants are crowding into the  towns is something appalling. We would call a man a fool who ran a station with  one-third of his hands at bookkeeping. We would think a mine pretty well doomed  where the overseers and clerical hands numbered nearly as many as the working  miners; <i>and yet we have about one-third  of our population in Sydney  and suburbs alone!</i> They are crowding into the townships, cutting one  another&rsquo;s throats to get employment, most of them half their time idle. Why is  this? The towns can only live on the produce of the country. They don&rsquo;t grow  anything in the towns. If there is a bad season in the country, it means so  much the less produce, so much, the less to export, so much the less to import  and use up and enjoy, so much the less to employ town labor on. This wonderful  preponderance of town labor is a thing which we may explain as we go on.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  The Mistake in our System</b></h2>
<p>Our  system clearly does not work as it ought. Where we have gone wrong was,  firstly, in dealing with our land. When our forefathers arrived here there was  any amount of land, and they started to grant it away wholesale to any one that  liked to take it; and the way in which they granted it was on the English  system of what is called &ldquo;fee simple tenure;&rdquo; that is to say, that the grantees  took the land from the Crown, to hold it for ever and ever, for themselves,  their heirs, and their assigns, free of any rent or payment to any one. No  provision was made for the fact that, as population increased, these lands  would become more and more valuable. They were parted with once and for all. It  was, no doubt, necessary to grant some sort of secure tenure, because no man  will produce anything by cultivating land, unless he knows that he will be  secured in the enjoyment of what he produces. To this extent, therefore, they  were bound to give security of tenure. But that is a very different thing from  granting a man land in &ldquo;fee simple.&rdquo; I intend to show that when the land was  granted away in fee simple, a cruel mistake was made, which has thus early  shown its effects on us and our prosperity. The present system is absurd and  unjust, in that it enables some people to get a lot of benefit from the  community to which they have no right, and it discourages industry and prevents  production. It encourages men to hold land idle, and its effects extend to us  all, as we all live by what the country produces. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; says the reader, &ldquo;this  man is simply a Henry Georgeite.&rdquo; I certainly agree with his arguments against  fee simple tenures; but I do not agree in his remedy. It is a wonderful thing  to me how so many people persist in looking upon Henry George as the discoverer  of the evils of a system of fee simple tenure. After reading his books, I took  up the older writers, Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill, thinking that it was  always a good thing to hear both sides of a question, and to my astonishment I  found that they agreed with George, or rather he with them, in every  particular. <i>There is no other side</i>.  What people call Henry Georgeism, i.e., objection to fee simple tenure in land,  is no new doctrine. Every economist has supported it. It was old before George  was born.</p>
<p>John  Stuart Mill says: &mdash; &ldquo;The plenty and cheapness of good land are the principle  causes of the rapid prosperity of new colonies. The engrossing of land in  effect destroys this plenty and cheapness. The engrossing of uncultivated land  besides is the greatest obstruction to its improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adam  Smith says (page 392): &mdash; &ldquo;I shall conclude this very long chapter with  observing that every improvement in the circumstances of the society tends  either directly or indirectly, to raise the real rent of land, to increase the  real wealth of the landlord, his power of purchasing the labor, or the produce  of the labor of other people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  will add here a cutting from a paper read by Mr. J. T. Walker, of Sydney, before the  Economic Association. Mr. Walker&rsquo;s opinion will carry weight with many men to  whom the name of Adam Smith is as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal. Mr.  Walker says:&mdash; &ldquo;I think that radical land reform, with due regard for vested  interests, and co-operation, are the true solution of labor and capital  difficulties.&quot;</p>
<p>If  the opinion of such men as Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill goes for anything  the mistake is here: but before going further into this question, I would like  to mention one matter&mdash;more harm than good is done by the energetic writers who  persist in denouncing all land-owners as &ldquo;monopolists,&rdquo; &ldquo;oppressors,&rdquo; and so  on. Land-owners are not different from other people; we see them constantly and  do not feel that they exhibit any desire to &ldquo;oppress the down-trodden laborer.&rdquo;  This sort of claptrap is largely talked in debating societies, and by back-slum  orators. It only keeps thinking people from going into the matter at all. The  old saying, that he who has no case must abuse the other side, is largely  believed in; and readers, who see that the land-reformers constantly denounce  the land-owners as monopolists, grabbers, and extortioners, are very apt to  believe that they do so because their own arguments are weak.</p>
<p>Landownership  in fee simple is a state of things which we ourselves have created, and was not  forced on us. If we can show that a grave mistake has been made in our dealings  with land, let us try and suggest some reform; but let us not go into  hysterical abuse of those who have profited by the mistake.</p>
<p>The  first objection is that the men who buy land in the early days of a settlement,  get a great deal of wealth to which they have no moral right. To illustrate  what I mean, near Melbourne  is a vast freehold estate owned by one family, and valued at a million of  money. Almost all of this is in the same state as it was when Batman first  settled on the place where Melbourne  now is, as being a likely site for a village. It carries sheep and nothing  else. From Williamstown right down nearly to Geelong, you travel through it. Near Sydney,  on the North Shore, is a vast unimproved block of water-frontage property,  which frowns on the harbor, bold and rugged, in just exactly the same state as  it was when Captain Cook brought his ships round there. It is now worth  hundreds of thousands of pounds. What has given these properties their value?  Clearly not the labor and trouble of their owners, as they are unimproved. They  have steadily increased in value ever since the settlements were founded,  because as a country gets more and more settled, and population gets denser,  the demand for such land near the capital cities becomes greater and greater.  When the community parted with these lands they got a few pounds only, which  was all they were worth. Then the people set to work to transform the howling  hush into a wealthy city; they worked and worked, building houses, making  railways and wharves, extending the suburbs; they added to the value of all  lands about there. Meanwhile the owners of these lands stood by and looked on.  &ldquo;We can wait,&rdquo; they said. They were paying no rent for the land, and they saw  that it was gradually going up in value, and that they would in time make a  handsome profit, not out of their own exertions, but those of the community.  The reader must remember that, as Henry George says, &ldquo;When a man makes a  fortune out of a rise in land value, it means that he can have fine clothes,  costly food, a house luxuriously furnished, etc. Now, these things are not the  spontaneous fruits of the soil, neither do they fall from heaven, nor are they  cast up by the sea. They are products of labor&mdash;can only be produced by labor;  and hence if men who do not labor get them, it must be at the expense of those  who do labor.&rdquo; To whom does the finest house about Sydney belong? It belongs to a man who inherited  a huge fortune, made solely out of the rise and rents of real estate near Sydney; a man who counts his fortune by hundreds of  thousands, and spends most of his time in England. He never did a day&rsquo;s work  in his life, and yet can have every luxury, while thousands of his fellow  countrymen have to toil and pinch and contrive to get a living. The more the  country goes ahead the more he prospers, and the less he need do. It looks  rather as if he &ldquo;had the loan of us,&rdquo; as the unrefined say. Yet it is not fair  to blame the man. We should blame the rotten, absurd system which makes such a  thing possible.</p>
<p>It  may be said, &ldquo;We have plenty of land; there is no need to make an outcry about  it being granted away,&mdash;you can get acres and acres out back at the selection price.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Out back&rdquo; you can; but every day the words &ldquo;out back&rdquo; mean further and further  out. At present the far back land has little value except what the owners add  to it; but every day there is less and less available land worth taking up. It  is all very well to point to dry waterless plains and say, &ldquo;There is  land&mdash;plenty of it&mdash;what are you complaining about the land system for? If you  want land, go and take up some of this.&rdquo; But there is an almighty difference  between such land as this, and the rich lands on the coast rivers, down about  Illawarra, and on the banks of the Hunter and Macleay. The injustice, the  stupidity, of the arrangement, consists in the fact that our immediate  predecessors granted away for ever and ever, in fee simple, free of rent, the best  lands we had, and left the present generation the wilderness. They should never  have allowed any absolute ownership free of rent to be acquired in land. As the  land gets more and more scarce, those who enjoy the advantage of using the  picked lands of the colony should also enjoy the privilege of paying something  to the community for it.</p>
<p>It  is evident that once all the available land gets into the hands of owners, they  have the rest of us at their mercy. Writers who deal with the subject as it  presents itself in older countries, are very fond of denouncing the tyranny of  the landlord over the tenant. This phase of the matter has not yet forced  itself upon our community to any extent. The country is too new for landlord  and tenant disputes to have sprung up; but we will have them sure enough. We  are creating the largest landed proprietors yet known&mdash;men who count their  freehold acres by the hundred thousand. As soon as we leave our cities with  their pitiful little subdivisions and crowded buildings, we can run in the  train through miles and miles of freehold estates all belonging to individual  owners. These will all be cut up into farms some day and leased out, and then  the fun will begin. We will have all the things which make life in Ireland so  enjoyable&mdash;plenty of good landlord shooting then. We all know the bitter hatred  between the tenants and their landlords, not only in Ireland,  but in Scotland, England and Wales. That sort of thing will come  here some day&mdash; the poverty and all, unless we mend our system.</p>
<p>As  to the question of discouraging improvements; many people are under the  impression that our present system, of what is practically absolute ownership,  is the only one that encourages improvements. &ldquo;If you make the tenure of land  subject to a rent,&rdquo; say they, &ldquo;or to any restrictions, there will be no money  spent on the land, no improvements made, and great deterioration will set in.  We will have wooden houses instead of stone, paling fences instead of walls.&rdquo;  But a very little thought will show them that this is erroneous. It is only  when the owner realises that he can only add to the value of his land by making  improvements, that improvements will be made in real earnest, under the present  system it generally pays better not to improve; improvements cost money. Any  man who has tried his hand at building and laying out a garden, knows that in  nine cases out of ten it would have paid him better to let the land be idle,  and wait for an increase in value. It is only when we get rid of this increase  in value through no good deed of the owner, that we will get proper increase in  value by way of improvements</p>
<p>As  to the locking-up of land; it is astonishing how far this locking-up system  prevails. Nearly every country town in New    South Wales is cursed by the proximity of some large  estate, which can neither be bought nor leased. Think of the loss to the  community caused by this. Every day&rsquo;s work done on bad land while better land  is lying idle is done at so much loss. Every unfortunate selector who is driven  out on to the Macquarie and the Bogan to take  up the dry plain, while land is lying idle on the rich river flats all over the  colony, is working at a dead loss to himself and the community. It is on the  success of such men as these that city men live. Our present system is direct  encouragement to the owners to hold land idle and wait for a rise. The thing  has taken a great hold in this colony, and the cleverest man is not the man who  can use a bit of land and make something out of it, but the man who can make a  rise out of a railway being made to his property.</p>
<p>For  city properties the evil is intensified. When we hear of George Street property fetching a  thousand pounds per foot, we say&mdash;&ldquo;How prosperous the country must be! What  wonderful advances we are making! A few years ago it could have been bought for  a hundred pounds an acre!&rdquo; What we ought to say is&mdash; &ldquo;What a dreadful handicap  on the colony it is, that men should be able to get such a lot of the colony's  products for land which was increased in value by the State. What fools we are  to allow it to go on!&rdquo; That is what we ought to say. To any one who understands  the matter, it is a cruel thing to see the settlers in the interior of our  colony, striving day after day on their little properties, with no comforts, no  leisure, no hopes nor aspirations beyond making a decent living, and to think  that it is owing to the labour of these men and such as these, that the owners  of Sydney are living luxuriously, travelling between this colony and England,  drawing large rentals, or spending the large values which they never did a  hand&rsquo;s turn to earn or deserve.</p>
<p>There  is one stock argument which seems to go down with a lot of people. It is said  that the people who buy land when it is worth little, and hold on to it till it  rises in value, are risking their money, and that if the land falls in value  they lose, so that they surely ought to be allowed to profit if it rises. The  answer to this is that we should never have to go into the risk at all. It is  too great a certainty that land will rise in any fertile unsettled country. The  man who buys runs a very small risk, and has the chance of a huge profit. The  community on the other hand make very small profit if the land falls in value  after it is sold, and they make a huge loss if it rises.</p>
<p>Land  which was bought for a pound an acre has often risen in value to &pound;20,000 per  acre by the exertions of the community, and the owner has reaped the benefit.  Land buying in the early stage of a settlement is a kind of lottery, in which  the investor is pretty certain to win; and where the fortunate men profit at  the expense of their fellow men, not for once but for all time, and not merely  for themselves but for their descendants. We have prohibited all other  lotteries, and yet not one of them ever did one millionth part of the harm  which this has done. There is no sense in abusing the men who have taken  advantage of this state of affairs. The way was open to them, and they adopted  it. I expect most of my readers only wish that their forefathers had secured a  few acres about Sydney,  at the time when they could be bought for a keg of rum. Their descendants need  do very little work now; other people would have to work for them.</p>
<p>There  is another argument sometimes advanced, which looks well on paper but carries  little weight. It is argued that if a man pays money for land and lets the land  lie idle, he is entitled to profit by any advance in its value, because he has  lost interest on his money. This is a rotten argument. If a man likes to lockup  his capital in unproductive, unused land, it is his own fault. The land is  handed over to him to use, not to look at. If he uses the land he can get a  return for it, which will pay his interest. If a man bought a mare for &pound;100,  and never rode her or bred from her, by the time she was twenty years of age he  would, if he calculated up the interest on her price, expect to get for her  several thousands of pounds, whereas he would really get nothing for so old an  animal, nor would he expect it. He would ride her and breed from her, and so  get a return for his money year by year. In the same way let the owners use the  land if they want interest.</p>
<p>This  is where we want to make a reform. Our land system is bad: it drives the men  into the cities; it causes good land to be locked up; it enables some men to  live at the expense of others; it enables a man to say by his will that for 21  years after his death no one shall use his land. Fancy that; a dead man&rsquo;s will  can override the needs of the living. We have created a land-grabbing mania &mdash; an  earth hunger. 552 persons in a population of over a million own upwards of  17,000,000 acres of freehold; they possess in fee simple over one-half the  alienated lands of New South Wales.  Squatters have been forced to buy where they would rather have taken a good  lease on secure tenure. To buy the land they have had to borrow largely from  English capital, and our lands are mortgaged up to the hilt; the purchase money  has been spent in wasteful extravagance in public buildings, in useless courthouses,  etc., in one-horse country towns. Where we ought to have spent money in  irrigation we have spent it in building tramways and bridges, and such like  city works, which add nothing to the productive power of the country. This is  the thing which cries aloud for a reform.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  The Remedy</b></h2>
<p>What  shape must our reform take? The followers of Henry George say, &ldquo;Resume all the  land again without paying compensation, except for improvements.&rdquo; At least,  they say, take all the annual value except enough to induce the land owners to  collect it. They purpose not only to make land pay all taxes, but to go on to  take all the annual value, whether needed for taxation or not. (Progress and  Poverty, page 289.) This is too sudden a remedy altogether.</p>
<p>We  cannot fairly resume the lands which we have sold, even though we got but small  money for them; we cannot fairly take &ldquo;all the annual return, except enough to  induce the owner to collect it.&rdquo; The men who own the land now are not, except  in some few cases, the men to whom it was originally granted. The present  holders have paid well for it in many cases; our whole credit system is founded  on those fee simple tenures; the banks have accepted the money of the  community, and have advanced it on security of these tenures. It would be too  great a jar, a dislocation of industry and security to attempt any sudden  method. Henry George wants to burst up the present system on which all our  credit and business is founded, and leave us without anything in its place, His  plan, if adopted, would make things very nice for our posterity, but would  leave us in a bad way.</p>
<p>The  great key-note of the reform must be to let men hold lands to use, and not to  look at. We must try and devise some means whereby the productive lands of the  country shall be available for use by individuals, under the most favourable  circumstances for themselves and for the community; we must devise some means  whereby no one can hold land idle and unproductive while others are anxious to  use it, and whereby all value created by the State will go to the State. We  must secure to every man the benefit of his labours, and so far as is needful  for that purpose we must give the holders secure tenure, and enable them to  mortgage their holdings to get an advance of money to aid in improvements, and to  allow them to sell out to others should they desire it. We must conform to the  tendency of the times to concentration, and allow good large areas to be  occupied.</p>
<p>We  cannot touch the values already accrued, but what we want to do is to find out  the present unimproved values, and see that any rise in them is reaped by the  State. If the owners like to let them lie idle they must pay for the privilege,  and above all, and beyond all, we must stop, once and for ever, the trafficking  in lands; if a man wants to make money out of land, let him do it by legitimate  improvements, not by &ldquo;holding for a rise.&rdquo; If we have any sense we will see  that the State gets the benefit of all rises.</p>
<p>How  can we do all this? First of all as to country lands &mdash; these are the productive  lands of the community, and if we take the matter in hand at once, there will  be little difficulty in dealing with these.</p>
<p>The  generality of country owners would lose nothing by any reform, because,  whatever value their lands have, they have themselves created by improvements  and labour. Almost any farmer in this Colony would cheerfully sell out if you  would pay him in full for all his improvements, and the original purchase money  of his land. They have got no &ldquo;unearned increment&rdquo; of value at the expense of  the public. We don&rsquo;t hear of a farmer making a hundred thousand pounds by the  construction of a railway to his farm; but we hear of speculators and  syndicates dealing in Sydney  property doing it often enough. The farmers have been working at their farms to  add value to city property, more than to their own property. Some farm land, of  course, has a value over and above the improvements&mdash;such land as the Hunter River   Valley, for instance.  There is farm land on the Hunter worth, unimproved, &pound;100 per acre; but all the  community ever got for it was &pound;1 or &pound;2 per acre. The men who own this sort of  land have got a large rise in values for which they never worked, and they are  in the same position as owners of city property.</p>
<p>To  put straight the tenure of country lands, I would make every land owner send in  a valuation of his land without improvements. Let it be optional for the State  to pay him or his mortgagees the unimproved value, and become his landlord at a  rent to be assessed; his improvements to remain his own property; or else let  the State put a tax on him calculated on the excess of his valuation over the  original price which he gave. We would thus get a true valuation, because every  owner would know that if he valued too high he would find himself taxed on that  value.</p>
<p>We  would thus resume control of the lands, and the existing credit system would  not be disturbed. The owners could hold for ever and ever, or until they liked  to sell out, but their lands should be revalued once in every five years and a  fresh rent imposed. This plan works very well in Japan. The speculation in land  would thus be done away with, because no man would be able to hold land as a  speculation; the rent would make him use it, and he would not be able to get  much more than the original unimproved valuation, because every five years such  valuation would be overhauled and rectified. His improvements he could at any  time get full value for, and he would thereby be encouraged to make  improvements and discouraged from holding land idle, instead of being, as now,  encouraged to hold it idle and discouraged from improving. Any bushman can tell  hundreds of cases where rich land is locked up in the big freehold runs,  carrying sheep, while miserable selectors are trying to get a living on stony ridges.  This rich land would be made pay a proportionate taxation; its present value  would be fixed so that the owner could never make anything by a rise in it.  That would be reaped by the State. The owner would be driven to improve or to  let others on to it who would improve it. This plan would greatly help all  small farmers and settlers. Their holdings would pay no rent to speak of,  having, without improvements, no value above the original purchase money. And  the immense increase in aggregate production that would result, would give us  all a fresh start. Owners of rich land would see that nothing would be gained  by holding on to it idle, and they would put it in use. There would be a demand  for labor of all sorts. The prosperity of the country would at once go ahead,  and prosperity of the country would mean prosperity of the towns. People would  be able to buy things, employ professional men, and meet their bills more  regularly than they can now. The town values of lands I would deal with in much  the same way. Fix the present value without improvements, by the owner&rsquo;s own  valuation, and let it be clearly understood that the owner would reap no  benefit from any advance on that value. Such value as he liked to add by  improvements he would be welcome to. Once the owners saw that they would make  no profit by holding their land idle, a lot of it would be brought into the  market, and prices all round would fall in consequence. The present absurdly  high value of land must be brought down somehow. It is no use saying we can do  it without any jar, because there must be some jar. The present owners of Sydney for instance (and  there are not such a great many of them) could, if they liked to combine  together, rob the colony of thousands and thousands of pounds by simply raising  their rents. The business of the Colony must be carried on in Sydney,  and under the present system we must pay the owners of Sydney what price they like for the use of  their land. There is no second Sydney  to go to. We have given them this vast power, and we cannot take it away by any  means which will be unfelt. I think the fairest way is to do as I have  suggested&mdash;don&rsquo;t interfere with the present values, but look after any future  value, and the result will be that prices for city land will reach their true  level.</p>
<p>The  tremendous lot of unimproved land about Sydney,  which is patiently waiting for a rise is something wonderful. Go up into the  Post Office tower and look round. You will see hundreds of acres of land,  exactly in the state in which Captain Cook found it, but all of it worth  according to present values from &pound;1000 per <i>foot</i> down to &pound;3 per foot. Once the owners get to know that no further advance is  possible, they will begin to use this land, and when all this unimproved land  comes into the market, the inhabitants of Sydney  will not have to levy such a heavy tax on their country brethren as they have  been doing, to pay the colossal rents of city properties.</p>
<p>This  is the great reform which must come sooner or later. I am quite aware that it  is little use arguing and pointing out a thing which is not severely felt&mdash;the  average Englishman feels nothing unless it hits him with the force of a club.  Well, this fee-simple ownership, if not mended, will hit us like a club, and  that before very long. It has hit them that way in the old country. They are  compelling landowners to hand over their land to tenants who wish to use it. I  propose some day to go more fully into this land question, and to point out in  detail its bearings on the different kinds of properties. For the present we  are all agog over our fiscal policy. Any change in the fiscal policy will mean  only a change in distribution; it will add but little to production of wealth.  Nevertheless, as it is, at the time of writing, the burning question, we may as  well try and get at the principles of it, and see how it affects us and our  prosperity.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  Our Fiscal Policy</b></h2>
<p>There  has sprung up, for what reason I know not, an impression that Land Reform and  Protection are diametrically opposed. The gentlemen who advocate the single tax  theory, meet the gentlemen who advocate Protection in deadly combat on public  platforms. There is no antagonism between true Land Reform and Protection, as I  propose to show. They support each other and should go together. The single tax  men forget that if they make their tax as heavy as George wishes, viz., a  confiscation tax, it will upset all existing arrangements, and burst up the  present system. If they only make it a light tax it will have no effect, but  will simply be passed on by the landlords to the tenants. The last time a land  tax was proposed this was provided for in all leases. The question between  Freetrade and Protection, when you come to the bedrock of it, is simply whether  it is better for a community such as ours to exchange its raw materials for the  manufactures of other countries, or to tax its own people and so create  manufactures.</p>
<p>It  is quite clear that the stock protectionist arguments hardly put the matter  properly. It is rather feeble to talk about being overwhelmed with foreign  boots, and inundated with cotton material. These things are not curses but  blessings. We wear boots and clothes; the question is whether it is better to  make these things for ourselves, or to get them from other countries where they  can be produced cheaper. The Freetrade theory is that so long as any foreign  country will furnish us with manufactured goods cheaper than our own people  will make them, it is advisable to let them come in free, because our own  people can go to something else more profitable. Bastiat, the great Freetrade  authority, says at page 210 of his &ldquo;Economic! Sophisms,&rdquo;&mdash; &ldquo;Why are men attached  to the system of Protection?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  as liberty (of exchange) enables them to obtain the same result with less  labor, this apparent diminution of employment frightens them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  do you say apparent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  all labor saved can be applied to something else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  I cannot specify, nor is there any need to specify it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  if the sum of satisfactions which the country at present enjoys could be  obtained at one-tenth less labor, no one could enumerate the new enjoyments  which men would desire to obtain from the labor left disposable. One man would  desire to be better clothed, another better fed, another better educated,  another better amused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again  at page 212:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  long as a man has wants to satisfy and time at his disposal, there is always  something to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  is the whole theory of Freetrade; and it is exactly on this point that in  practice the Freetrade arguments break down. Something else! Our people ought  to be able to go to something else, no doubt; they ought to be able to go out  into the bush and grow wool and dig up the minerals. The market for these things  is not yet over-supplied, and the land is not yet exhausted; but, owing to our  land tenure system, their chances of going to something else are lessening  every day. So long as there are unemployed or only partially employed men,  crowding into our cities eager for a job of work, it is no use for the  freetraders to say that there is no need to foster manufactures, because the people  can go to something else. They can&rsquo;t get anything else to go to. So long as  they try to keep up their wages, <i>i.e</i>.,  to maintain a high standard of living, they cannot hope to compete with the  underpaid laborers of the continent and England. Henry George, in his  &ldquo;Protection and Freetrade,&rdquo; lays down a doctrine which amounts to this, that whereever  wages are highest production is cheapest, and he quotes the Americans as a  proof. The Americans have got a start of the world in machinery, and can turn  out manufactured articles cheaper than lower wage countries. When those lower  wage countries get the same machinery as the Americans (and this they are doing  every day), they will soon disprove this fallacy that the more a man is paid  for his work, the less expensive his work is. The true reason of the American  success is simply that they have a huge local market secured to them by  Protection, The bigger the market the cheaper can the articles be sold, If any  coachbuilder here were to try and make buggies of the same quality as the Abbot  or Fleming buggies, he would promptly go smash. They have a huge home market,  and where he could sell one they could sell a hundred, so that they can gain  all the advantages derived from doing things on a big scale. They can compete  with foreign labor because of their huge home market, because of their immense  start in machinery and scientific knowledge, and because they are protected  heavily against foreign competition both of goods and labor&mdash;no unemployed  foreigner can land in America  without paying a tax, nor can his goods go in without paying a tax. It sounds  rather well for them to talk about fair competition with the world! The fact is  that where labor is high no manufactures can stand without protection. Adam  Smith said that they would grow up naturally; as a nation grew out of the  infancy stage its surplus capital would, he said, &ldquo;naturally turn itself to the  employment of artificers and manufacturers at home.&rdquo; Both those artificers and  manufacturers, finding at home the materials (in our case say wool and corn),  and the subsistence (i.e., capital) necessary for their work, might  immediately, even with less skill, be able to work <i>as cheap</i> as inhabitants of mercantile states at a distance (say England).  They might not be able to compete at first, because they would not have such  good machinery; but in time they would be able to compete, and be able to  &ldquo;jostle&rdquo; the manufacturing country out of the local markets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith,  in this paragraph, overlooks the fact that labor will not reduce its wages  sufficiently to compete with &ldquo;mercantile&rdquo; states. They only hold their own by  degrading their labor to the starvation point, and to &ldquo;jostle&rdquo; them out of our  own, or any other market, we must reduce our laborers accordingly, a thing  which we are loth to do. He says (page 17) that by this means any landed  country will in time manufacture and carry too. But the great wages question he  has overlooked. We cannot compete with German iron goods, for instance, even  though we have the iron here, until our laborers like to come down to working  14 hours a day, with no holidays.</p>
<p>The  English operatives can beat our local cloth factories in our own markets,  although the wool has to be carried there and handled by hosts of people, and  brought back here made up. If we could get men at English wages we would soon  beat them; but the old, old question then comes up&mdash;are we going to pauperise  our labor in the strife for the world&rsquo;s markets? It must be remembered that our  object is to put our working classes on a higher footing than they now stand;  and if we do this, we can never expect them to manufacture things for us at the  same rate of pay as the foreign makers get. The trusts and monopolies whereby  laborers are robbed, and which grow up under protection, and which formed, so  far as I can see, almost the sole basis for Henry George&rsquo;s book, &ldquo;Freetrade and  Protection,&rdquo; are not the fault of the system; but of the way it is  administered.</p>
<p>This  question of Freetrade and Protection is purely a wages question. While we have  men unemployed, or half employed, it is idle to talk about the economic value  of their labor, and to say that they need not manufacture, as they can go to  something else. It is for the freetraders to say to what else they should go.  Failing an answer to this question, the country will inevitably go for  protection. We can see pretty clearly the reason why these men are unemployed:  the bad land tenure system is the reason of it. But even when tenures are put  right, I think protection is the correct policy. We can, of course, all devote  our attention to wool-growing and farming, two things in which, by reason of  our superior natural advantages, we are bound (for the present, at any rate) to  find something to do. We can exchange our products for those of other  countries. With all our best land available, we might command the markets of  the world for raw material. But is it a fitting destiny for such a nation as  ours, that we should have no higher objects than to grow wool and reap corn?  Are we to have no arts nor manufactures? These things will only grow by  protection. There is no question what protection is: it simply means taking out  of the pockets of certain of the community a sum of money for the benefit of  the others; and I say deliberately that such a proceeding is right. We have now  the best of the wool trade; but the South American supplies are catching on us.  We cannot export wheat to compete with America. It is better for us to  make for ourselves a local market, even as the Americans have done. It is better  to lay a tax on the exporting producers, and enable some of our people to start  manufactures, so that as these latter grow up we can create a system of  exchange over which we have control. Our own farmers and wool-growers will have  a certain market with their own manufacturers; and the manufacturers will have  a certain market with their country people, instead of having to compete with  auction sold goods sent out here in huge batches, and made by starving wretches  working 15 hours a day. There is no doubt that there are quite enough of us to  get a good living, even when dividing our labor as I propose. Every other  country almost has done the same thing. If all the world were one country,  under one set of laws, it would be a different matter. But we cannot long  devote ourselves entirely to wool-growing and farming, and as soon as we get  any surplus labor we must give it a chance.</p>
<p>Here  is the gist of the whole matter. Adam Smith says:&mdash; &ldquo;It is the maxim of every  prudent master of a family never to attempt to make at home what it will cost  him more to make than to buy.&rdquo; No, but if he has to keep some of his family  doing nothing, it is better to make the article, even at a loss, than submit to  the loss of keeping the family idle, and also buying the thing.</p>
<p>This,  then, should be our policy: Reform our land tenure, so that we may get the best  possible use out of our lands; and reform our tariff, so that we may give our  industries a start on some other basis than that of cheap labor. We will, of  course, amass a huge revenue of Government; but I have yet to learn that <i>that</i> is an evil. There are plenty of  ways of spending Government money besides building the North Shore  bridge. We can start irrigation works, and go in for artesian water. We can  afford to amuse ourselves a little, and life need not be such a very &ldquo;root-hog-or-  die&rdquo; proceeding as it now is.</p>
<p>One  question is much debated&mdash;Should trade be free between the colonies? Certainly,  once we get all the colonies under one Government, and get the land system in  each on a proper basis. At present our farmers out in the back country, are  clamouring for protection against Victorian products. They say that the cost of  carriage prevents them having a chance. That is one of the beauties of our  present land system, that men have to go three or four hundred miles inland to  make a homestead, while better land is lying idle near the towns; also, they  say that they cannot compete with the splendid land which the Victorian farmers  enjoy. When we get a proper land system, all such land will pay an additional  rent to the State, and the man that has the advantage of using it will have the  privilege of paying for it. We must always keep in view that our object is the  greatest good for the greatest number; and as soon as we get all the colonies  under one government and under a proper land system, then we will know that  everyone has a fair chance, and it will pay us better to put some of our people  on to manufactures and art, rather than to go on being &ldquo;a country where they  grow wool.&rdquo; This will be better than letting our manufactures grow up, by our  population growing down in their standard of living.</p>
