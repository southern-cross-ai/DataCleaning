<p>Am&nbsp;I waking? Was I  sleeping?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dearest, are you  watching yet?<br>
  Traces on your cheeks of weeping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glitter, &rsquo;tis in vain  you fret;<br>
  Drifting ever! drifting onward!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the glass the  bright sand runs<br>
  Steadily and slowly downward;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hushed are all the  Myrmidons. </p>
<p>Has Automedon been banish&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his post beside my bed?<br>
  Where has Agamemnon vanished?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is warlike Diomed?<br>
  Where is Nestor? where Ulysses?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Menelaus, where is he?<br>
  Call them not, more dear your kisses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than their prosings are to me.</p>
<p>Daylight fades and night must follow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low, where sea and sky combine,<br>
  Droops the orb of great Apollo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hostile god to me and mine.<br>
  Through the tent&rsquo;s wide entrance streaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a flood of glory rare,<br>
  Glides the golden sunset, gleaming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On your golden, gleaming hair.</p>
<p>Chide him not, the leech who tarries,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surest aid were all too late;<br>
  Surer far the shaft of Paris,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winged by Ph&oelig;bus and by fate;<br>
  When he crouch&rsquo;d behind the gable,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had I once his features scann&rsquo;d,<br>
  Ph&oelig;bus&rsquo; self had scarce been able<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have nerved his trembling hand.</p>
<p>Blue-eyed maiden! dear Athena!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goddess chaste, and wise and brave,<br>
  From the snares of Polyxena<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou would&rsquo;st fain thy favourite save.<br>
  Tell me, is it not far better<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it should be as it is?<br>
  Jove&rsquo;s behest we cannot fetter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate&rsquo;s decrees are always his.</p>
<p>Many seek for peace and riches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Length of days and life of ease;<br>
  I have sought for one thing, which is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fairer unto me than these.<br>
  Often, too, I&rsquo;ve heard the story,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my boyhood, of the doom<br>
  Which the fates assigned me&mdash;Glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with an early tomb.</p>
<p>Swift assault and sudden sally<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underneath the Trojan wall;<br>
  Charge, and countercharge, and rally,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War-cry loud, and trumpet call;<br>
  Doubtful strain of desp&rsquo;rate battle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cut and thrust and grapple fierce,<br>
  Swords that ring on shields that rattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blades that gash and darts that pierce;&mdash;</p>
<p>I have done with these for ever;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the loud resounding sea,<br>
  Where the reedy jav&rsquo;lins quiver,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is now no place for me.<br>
  Day by day our ranks diminish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are falling day by day;<br>
  But our sons the strife will finish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where man tarries man must slay.</p>
<p>Life, &rsquo;tis said, to all men sweet is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death to all must bitter be;<br>
  Wherefore thus, oh, mother Thetis?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None can baffle Jove&rsquo;s decree;<br>
  I am ready, I am willing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To resign my stormy life;<br>
  Weary of this long blood-spilling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sated with this ceaseless strife.</p>
<p>Shorter doom I&rsquo;ve pictured dimly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a bed of crimson sand;<br>
  Fighting hard and dying grimly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent lips, and striking hand;<br>
  But the toughest lives are brittle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the bravest and the best<br>
  Lightly fall&mdash;it matters little;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I only long for rest.</p>
<p>I have seen enough of slaughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen Scamander&rsquo;s torrent red,<br>
  Seen hot blood poured out like water,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen the champaign heaped with dead.<br>
  Men will call me unrelenting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitiless, vindictive, stern;<br>
  Few will raise a voice dissenting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few will better things discern.</p>
<p>Speak! the fires of life are reeling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the wildfires on the marsh,<br>
  Was I to a friend unfeeling?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was I to a mistress harsh?<br>
  Was there nought save bloodshed throbbing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this heart and on this brow?<br>
  Whisper! girl, in silence sobbing!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead Patroclus! answer thou!</p>
<p>Dry those violet orbs that glisten,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Darling, I have had my day;<br>
  Place your hand in mine and listen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the strong soul cleaves its way<br>
  Through the death mist hovering o&rsquo;er me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the stout ship cleaves the wave,<br>
  To my fathers gone before me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the gods who love the brave!</p>
<p>Courage, we must part for certain;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shades that sink and shades that rise,<br>
  Blending in a shroud-like curtain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather o&rsquo;er these weary eyes.<br>
  O&rsquo;er the fields we used to roam, in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brighter days and lighter cheer,<br>
  Gathers thus the quiet gloaming&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I ween, the end is near.</p>
<p>For the hand that clasps your fingers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closing in the death-grip tight,<br>
  Scarcely feels the warmth that lingers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarcely heeds the pressure light;<br>
  While the failing pulse that alters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changing &rsquo;neath a death chill damp,<br>
  Flickers, flutters, flags, and falters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feebly like a waning lamp.</p>
<p>Think&rsquo;st thou, love, &rsquo;twill chafe my ghost,  in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hades&rsquo; realm, where heroes shine,<br>
  Should I hear the shepherd boasting<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his Argive concubine?<br>
  Let him boast, the girlish victor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him brag; not thus, I trow,<br>
  Were the laurels torn from Hector,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so very long ago.</p>
<p>Does my voice sound thick and husky?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is my hand no longer warm?<br>
  Round that neck where pearls look dusky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me once more wind my arm;<br>
  Rest my head upon that shoulder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where it rested oft of yore;<br>
  Warm and white, yet seeming colder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now than e&rsquo;er it seem&rsquo;d before.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas the fraud of Priam&rsquo;s daughter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the force of Priam&rsquo;s son,<br>
  Slew me&mdash;ask not why I sought her,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas my doom&mdash;her work is done!<br>
  Fairer far than she, and dearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a thousandfold thou art;<br>
  Come, my own one, nestle nearer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheating death of half his smart.</p>
<p>Slowly, while your amber tresses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shower down their golden rain,<br>
  Let me drink those last caresses,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never to be felt again;<br>
  Yet th&rsquo; Elysian halls are spacious,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere near me I may keep<br>
  Room&mdash;who knows?&mdash;The gods are gracious;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay me lower&mdash;let me sleep!</p>
<p>Lower yet, my senses wander,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my spirit seems to roll<br>
  With the tide of swift Scamander<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing to a viewless goal.<br>
  In my ears, like distant washing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the surf upon the shore,<br>
  Drones a murmur, faintly splashing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the splash of Charon&rsquo;s oar.</p>
<p>Lower yet, my own Briseis,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denser shadows veil the light;<br>
  Hush, what is to be, to be is,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close my eyes, and say good-night.<br>
  Lightly lay your red lips, kissing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this cold mouth, while your thumbs<br>
  Lie on these cold eyelids pressing&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallas! thus thy soldier comes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Gone"></a>Gone</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;Collins-street standeth a statue tall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statue tall on a pillar of stone,<br>
  Telling its story, to great and small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the dust reclaimed from the sand waste lone;<br>
  Weary and wasted, and worn and wan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeble and faint, and languid and low,<br>
  He lay on the desert a dying man;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who has gone, my friends, where we all must go.</p>
<p>There are perils by land, and perils by water,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Short, I ween, are the obsequies<br>
  Of the landsman lost, but they may be shorter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the mariner lost in the trackless seas;<br>
  And well for him when the timbers start,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stout ship reels and settles below,<br>
  Who goes to his doom with as bold a heart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that dead man gone, where we all must go.</p>
<p>Man is stubborn his rights to yield,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And redder than dews at eventide<br>
  Are the dews of battle, shed on the field,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a nation&rsquo;s wrath or a despot&rsquo;s pride;<br>
  But few who have heard their death-knell roll,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cannon&rsquo;s lips where they faced the foe,<br>
  Have fallen as stout and steady of soul<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As that dead man gone where we all must go.</p>
<p>Traverse yon spacious burial-ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many are sleeping soundly there,<br>
  Who pass&rsquo;d with mourners standing around,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kindred and friends, and children fair;<br>
  Did he envy such ending? &rsquo;twere hard to say;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he cause to envy such ending? no;<br>
  Can the spirit feel for the senseless clay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it once has gone where we all must go?</p>
<p>What matters the sand or the whitening chalk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blighted herbage, the black&rsquo;ning log,<br>
  The crooked beak of the eagle-hawk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the hot red tongue of the native dog?<br>
  That couch was rugged, those sextons rude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, in spite of a leaden shroud, we know<br>
  That the bravest and fairest are earth-worms&rsquo; food,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once they&rsquo;ve gone where we all must go.</p>
<p>With the pistol clenched in his failing hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the death mist spread o&rsquo;er his fading eyes,<br>
  He saw the sun go down on the sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he slept, and never saw it rise;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas well; he toil&rsquo;d till his task was done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Constant and calm in his latest throe;<br>
  The storm was weathered, the battle was won,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he went, my friends, where we all must go.</p>
<p>God grant that whenever, soon or late,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our course is run and our goal is reach&rsquo;d,<br>
  We may meet our fate as steady and straight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he whose bones in yon desert bleach&rsquo;d;<br>
  No tears are needed&mdash;our cheeks are dry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have none to waste upon living woe;<br>
  Shall we sigh for one who has ceased to sigh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having gone, my friends, where we all must go?</p>
<p>We tarry yet, we are toiling still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is gone and he fares the best,<br>
  He fought against odds, he struggled up hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He has fairly earned his season of rest;<br>
  No tears are needed&mdash;fill out the wine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the goblets clash, and the grape juice flow;<br>
  Ho! pledge me a death-drink, comrade mine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a brave man gone where we all must go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Unshriven"></a>Unshriven</h2>
<p>Oh!&nbsp;the sun rose on  the lea, and the bird sang merrilie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the steed stood  ready harness&rsquo;d in the hall,<br>
  And he left his lady&rsquo;s bower, and he sought  the eastern tower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he lifted cloak  and weapon from the wall. </p>
<p>&ldquo;We were wed but yester-noon, must we  separate so soon?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must you travel unassoiled and, aye, unshriven,<br>
  With the blood stain on your hand, and the red streak on your brand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your guilt all unconfess&rsquo;t and unforgiven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tho&rsquo; it were but yester-even we were  wedded, still unshriven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the moor this morning I must ride;<br>
  I must gallop fast and straight, for my errand will not wait;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear naught, I shall return at eventide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I fear, it is for thee, thy weal is  dear to me,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yon moor with retribution seemeth rife;<br>
  As we&rsquo;ve sown so must we reap, and I&rsquo;ve started in my sleep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the voice of the avenger, &lsquo;Life for life&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My arm is strong, I ween, and my trusty  blade is keen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the courser that I ride is swift and sure,<br>
  And I cannot break my oath, though to leave thee I am loth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one that I must meet upon the moor.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Oh! the sun shone on the lea, and the bird sang  merrilie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down the avenue and  through the iron gate,<br>
  Spurr&rsquo;d and belted, so he rode, steel to draw  and steel to goad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And across the moor he  galloped fast and straight. </p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Oh! the sun shone on the lea, and the bird sang  full of glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the mists of  evening gather&rsquo;d chill and grey;<br>
  But the wild bird&rsquo;s merry note on the deaf ear  never smote,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sunshine never  warm&rsquo;d the lifeless clay. </p>
<p>Ere the sun began to droop, or the mist  began to stoop,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The youthful bride lay swooning in the hall;<br>
  Empty saddle on his back, broken bridle hanging slack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The steed returned full gallop to the stall.</p>
<p>Oh! the sun sank in the sea, and the wind  wail&rsquo;d drearilie;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the bells in yonder monastery toll,<br>
  For the night rack nestles dark round the body stiff and stark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unshriven to its Maker flies the soul.</p>

<p>Lightly the breath of the spring wind  blows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though laden with faint perfume,<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the fragrance rare that the bushman knows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scent of the wattle bloom.<br>
  Two-thirds of our journey at least are done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old horse! let us take a spell<br>
  In the shade from the glare of the noonday sun,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus far we have travell&rsquo;d well;<br>
  Your bridle I&rsquo;ll slip, your saddle ungirth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lay them beside this log,<br>
  For you&rsquo;ll roll in that track of reddish earth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shake like a water-dog.</p>
<p>Upon yonder rise there&rsquo;s a clump of trees&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their shadows look cool and broad&mdash;<br>
  You can crop the grass as fast as you please,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I stretch my limbs on the sward;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis pleasant, I ween, with a leafy screen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the weary head, to lie<br>
  On the mossy carpet of emerald green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath the vault of the azure sky;<br>
  Thus all alone by the wood and wold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I yield myself once again<br>
  To the memories old that, like tales fresh told,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come flitting across the brain.</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;They have saddled a hundred milk-white  steeds,<br>
  They have bridled a hundred black.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Old  Ballad</i></p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;He turned in his saddle, now follow who  dare.<br>
  I ride for my country, quoth * * .&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Lawrence</i></p>
<p>I remember the lowering wintry morn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the mist on the Cotswold hills,<br>
  Where I once heard the blast of the huntsman&rsquo;s horn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not far from the seven rills.<br>
  Jack Esdale was there, and Hugh St. Clair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bob Chapman and Andrew Kerr,<br>
  And big George Griffiths on Devil-May-Care,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And&mdash;black Tom Oliver.<br>
  And one who rode on a dark-brown steed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean jointed, sinewy, spare,<br>
  With the lean game head of the Blacklock breed,<br>
  And the resolute eye that loves the lead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the quarters massive and square&mdash;<br>
  A tower of strength, with a promise of speed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(There was Celtic blood in the pair).</p>
<p>I remember how merry a start we got,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the red fox broke from the gorse,<br>
  In a country so deep, with a scent so hot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the hound could outpace the horse;<br>
  I remember how few in the front rank shew&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How endless appeared the tail,<br>
  On the brown hill-side, where we cross&rsquo;d the road,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And headed towards the vale.<br>
  The dark-brown steed on the left was there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the right was a dappled grey,<br>
  And between the pair, on a chestnut mare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The duffer who writes this lay.<br>
  What business had &ldquo;this child&rdquo; there to ride?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But little or none at all;<br>
  Yet I held my own for a while in &ldquo;the pride<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That goeth before a fall.&rdquo;<br>
  Though rashness can hope for but one result,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are heedless when fate draws nigh us,<br>
  And the maxim holds good, &ldquo;<i>Quem perdere  vult<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deus, dementat prius</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The right hand man to the left hand said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As down in the vale we went,<br>
  &ldquo;Harden your heart like a millstone, Ned,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And set your face as flint;<br>
  Solid and tall is the rasping wall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stretches before us yonder;<br>
  You must have it at speed or not at all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twere better to halt than to ponder,<br>
  For the stream runs wide on the take-off side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And washes the clay bank under;<br>
  Here goes for a pull, &rsquo;tis a madman&rsquo;s ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a broken neck if you blunder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No word in reply his comrade spoke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor waver&rsquo;d nor once look&rsquo;d round,<br>
  But I saw him shorten his horse&rsquo;s stroke<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we splash&rsquo;d through the marshy ground;<br>
  I remember the laugh that all the while<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his quiet features play&rsquo;d:&mdash;<br>
  So he rode to his death, with that careless smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the van of the &ldquo;Light Brigade&rdquo;;<br>
  So stricken by Russian grape, the cheer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rang out, while he toppled back,<br>
  From the shattered lungs as merry and clear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it did when it roused the pack.<br>
  Let never a tear his memory stain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give his ashes never a sigh,<br>
  One of many who perished,&nbsp;<i>not in vain</i>,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>As a type of our chivalry</i>&mdash;</p>
<p>I remember one thrust he gave to his hat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And two to the flanks of the brown,<br>
  And still as a statue of old he sat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he shot to the front, hands down;<br>
  I remember the snort and the stag-like bound<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the steed six lengths to the fore,<br>
  And the laugh of the rider while, landing sound,<br>
  He turned in his saddle and glanced around;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember&mdash;but little more,<br>
  Save a bird&rsquo;s-eye gleam of the dashing stream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A jarring thud on the wall,<br>
  A shock and the blank of a nightmare&rsquo;s dream&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was down with a stunning fall.</p>

<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Free  Translation)</i></p>
<p>I remember some words my father said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was an urchin vain;&mdash;<br>
  God rest his soul, in his narrow bed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These ten long years he hath lain.<br>
  When I think one drop of the blood he bore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This faint heart surely must hold,<br>
  It may be my fancy and nothing more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the faint heart seemeth bold.</p>
<p>He said that as from the blood of grape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or from juice distilled from the grain,<br>
  False vigour, soon to evaporate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is lent to nerve and brain;<br>
  So the coward will dare on the gallant horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What he never would dare alone,<br>
  Because he exults in a borrowed force,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a hardihood not his own.</p>
<p>And it may be so, yet this difference lies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twixt the vine and the saddle-tree,<br>
  The spurious courage that drink supplies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sets our baser passions free;<br>
  But the stimulant which the horseman feels<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he gallops fast and straight,<br>
  To his better nature most appeals,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And charity conquers hate.</p>
<p>As the kindly sunshine thaws the snow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E&rsquo;en malice and spite will yield,<br>
  We could almost welcome our mortal foe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the saddle by flood and field;<br>
  And chivalry dawns in the merry tale<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That &ldquo;Market Harborough&rdquo; writes,<br>
  And the yarns of &ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; and &ldquo;Martingale&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seem legends of loyal knights.</p>
<p>Now tell me for once, old horse of mine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grazing round me loose and free,<br>
  Does your ancient equine heart repine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a burst in such companie,<br>
  Where &ldquo;the&nbsp;<i>Powers</i>&nbsp;that be&rdquo; in the front rank ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To hold your own with the throng,<br>
  Or to plunge at &ldquo;Faugh-a-Ballagh&rsquo;s&rdquo; side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the rapids of Dandenong.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t tread on my toes, you&rsquo;re no foolish  weight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I found to my cost, as under<br>
  Your carcase I lay, when you rose too late,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I blame you not for the blunder.<br>
  What! sulky old man, your under-lip falls!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think I, too, ready to rail am<br>
  At your kinship remote to that duffer at walls,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The talkative roadster of Balaam.</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Then hey for boot and horse, lad!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And round the world away!<br>
  Young blood will have its course, lad!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every dog his day!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>C. Kingsley</i></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a formula which the west country  clowns<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once used, ere their blows fell thick,<br>
  At the fairs on the Devon and Cornwall  downs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their bouts with the single-stick.<br>
  You may read a moral, not far amiss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you care to moralise,<br>
  In the crossing-guard, where the ash-plants kiss,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the words &ldquo;God spare our eyes.&rdquo;<br>
  No game was ever yet worth a rap<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a rational man to play,<br>
  Into which no accident, no mishap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could possibly find its way.</p>
<p>If you hold the willow, a shooter from  Wills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May transform you into a hopper,<br>
  And the football meadow is rife with spills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you feel disposed for a cropper;<br>
  In a rattling gallop with hound and horse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may chance to reverse the medal<br>
  On the sward, with the saddle your loins across,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your hunter&rsquo;s loins on the saddle;<br>
  In the stubbles you&rsquo;ll find it hard to frame<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A remonstrance firm, yet civil,<br>
  When oft as &ldquo;our mutual friend&rdquo; takes aim,<br>
  Long odds may be laid on the rising game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And against your gaiters level;<br>
  There&rsquo;s danger even where fish are caught,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who a wetting fear;<br>
  For what&rsquo;s worth having must aye be bought,<br>
  And sport&rsquo;s like life and life&rsquo;s like sport,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t all skittles and beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The honey bag lies close to the sting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rose is fenced by the thorn,<br>
  Shall we leave to others their gathering,<br>
  And turn from clustering fruits that cling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the garden wall in scorn?<br>
  Albeit those purple grapes hang high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the fox in the ancient tale,<br>
  Let us pause and try, ere we pass them by,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we, like the fox, may fail.</p>
<p>All hurry is worse than useless; think<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the adage, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis pace that kills&rdquo;;<br>
  Shun bad tobacco, avoid strong drink,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstain from Holloway&rsquo;s pills,<br>
  Wear woollen socks, they&rsquo;re the best you&rsquo;ll find,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware how you leave off flannel;<br>
  And whatever you do, don&rsquo;t change your mind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When once you have picked your panel;<br>
  With a bank of cloud in the south south-east,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand ready to shorten sail;<br>
  Fight shy of a corporation feast;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&rsquo;t trust to a martingale;<br>
  Keep your powder dry, and shut one eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not both, when you touch your trigger;<br>
  Don&rsquo;t stop with your head too frequently<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(This advice ain&rsquo;t meant for a nigger);<br>
  Look before you leap, if you like, but if<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean leaping, don&rsquo;t look long,<br>
  Or the weakest place will soon grow stiff,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strongest doubly strong;<br>
  As far as you can, to every man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let your aid be freely given,<br>
  And hit out straight, &rsquo;tis your shortest plan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When against the ropes you&rsquo;re driven.</p>
<p>Mere pluck, though not in the least  sublime,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is wiser than blank dismay,<br>
  Since &ldquo;No sparrow can fall before its time&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we&rsquo;re valued higher than they;<br>
  So hope for the best and leave the rest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In charge of a stronger hand,<br>
  Like the honest boors in the far-off west,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the formula terse and grand.</p>
<p>They were men for the most part rough and  rude,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dull and illiterate,<br>
  But they nursed no quarrel, they cherished no feud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were strangers to spite and hate;<br>
  In a kindly spirit they took their stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brothers and sons might learn<br>
  How a man should uphold the sports of his land,<br>
  And strike his best with a strong right hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And take his strokes in return.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a barbarous practice,&rdquo; the Quaker cries,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a thing of the past, thank heaven&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  Keep your thanks till the combative instinct dies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the taint of the olden leaven;<br>
  Yes, the times are changed, for better or worse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prayer that no harm befall<br>
  Has given its place to a drunken curse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the manly game to a brawl.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *  * *</p>
<p>Our burdens are heavy, our natures weak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some pastime devoid of harm<br>
  May we look for? &ldquo;Puritan elder, speak!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Yea, friend, peradventure thou mayest seek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recreation singing a psalm.&rdquo;<br>
  If I did, your visage so grim and stern<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would relax in a ghastly smile,<br>
  For of music I never one note could learn,<br>
  And my feeble minstrelsy would turn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your chant to discord vile.</p>
<p>Tho&rsquo; the Philistine&rsquo;s mail could not  avail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the spear like a weaver&rsquo;s beam,<br>
  There are episodes yet in the Psalmist&rsquo;s tale,<br>
  To obliterate which his poems fail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which his exploits fail to redeem.<br>
  Can the Hittite&rsquo;s wrongs forgotten be?<br>
  Does&nbsp;<i>he</i>&nbsp;warble &ldquo;<i>Non  nobis Domine</i>&rdquo;,<br>
  With his monarch in blissful concert, free<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From all malice to flesh inherent;<br>
  Zeruiah&rsquo;s offspring, who served so well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet between the horns of the altar fell&mdash;<br>
  Does&nbsp;<i>his</i>&nbsp;voice the &ldquo;<i>Quid  gloriaris</i>&rdquo; swell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the &ldquo;<i>Quare  fremuerunt</i>&rdquo;?<br>
  It may well be thus where&nbsp;<i>David</i>&nbsp;sings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Uriah joins in the chorus,<br>
  But while earth to earthy matter clings,<br>
  Neither you nor the bravest of Judah&rsquo;s kings<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the vessel is crack&rsquo;d and old,<br>
  To cherish the battered potters&rsquo; clay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As though it were virgin gold?<br>
  Take care of yourself, dull, boorish elf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though prudent and safe you seem,<br>
  Your pitcher will break on the musty shelf,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How I loved her many years syne;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their length&rsquo;ning shadows cast.<br>
  &ldquo;Time flies.&rdquo; The current will be no joke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If swollen by recent rain,<br>
  To cross in the dark, so I&rsquo;ll have a smoke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I&rsquo;ll be off again.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s up, old horse? Your ears you prick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your eager eyeballs glisten;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the wild dog&rsquo;s note in the tea-tree thick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the river, to which you listen.<br>
  With head erect and tail flung out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a gallop you seem to beg,<br>
  But I feel the qualm of a chilling doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I glance at your fav&rsquo;rite leg.</p>
<p>Let the dingo rest, &rsquo;tis all for the best;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this world there&rsquo;s room enough<br>
  For him and you and me and the rest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the country is awful rough.<br>
  We&rsquo;ve had our gallop in days of yore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now down the hill we must run;<br>
  Yet at times we long for one gallop more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although it were only one.</p>
<p>Did our spirits quail at a new four-rail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could a &ldquo;double&rdquo; double-bank us,<br>
  Ere nerve and sinew began to fail<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the consulship of Plancus?<br>
  When our blood ran rapidly, and when<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our bones were pliant and limber,<br>
  Could we stand a merry cross-counter then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slogging fall over timber?</p>
<p>Arcades ambo! Duffers both,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our best of days, alas!<br>
  (I tell the truth, though to tell it loth)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis time we were gone to grass;<br>
  The young leaves shoot, the sere leaves fall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old gives way to the new,<br>
  While the preacher cries, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis vanity all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And vexation of spirit, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now over my head the vapours curl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the bowl of the soothing clay,<br>
  In the misty forms that eddy and whirl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My thoughts are flitting away;<br>
  Yes, the preacher&rsquo;s right, &rsquo;tis vanity all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the sweeping rebuke he showers<br>
  On vanities all may heaviest fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On vanities worse than ours.</p>
<p>We have no wish to exaggerate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worth of the sports we prize,<br>
  Some toil for their church, and some for their state,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some for their merchandise;<br>
  Some traffic and trade in the city&rsquo;s mart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some travel by land and sea,<br>
  Some follow science, some cleave to art,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And some to scandal and tea;</p>
<p>And some for their country and their queen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would fight, if the chance they had,<br>
  Good sooth, &rsquo;twere a sorry world, I ween,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all went galloping mad;<br>
  Yet if once we efface the joys of the chase<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the land, and outroot the Stud,<br>
  <i>Good-bye to the anglo-saxon race!</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Farewell to the norman blood!</i></p>
<p>Where the burn runs down to the uplands  brown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the heights of the snow-clad range,<br>
  What anodyne drawn from the stifling town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be reckon&rsquo;d a fair exchange<br>
  For the stalker&rsquo;s stride, on the mountain side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bracing northern weather,<br>
  To the slopes where couch, in their antler&rsquo;d pride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deer on the perfum&rsquo;d heather?</p>
<p>Oh! the vigour with which the air is rife!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of joyous motion;<br>
  The fever, the fulness of animal life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can be drain&rsquo;d from no earthly potion!<br>
  The lungs with the living gas grow light,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the limbs feel the strength of ten,<br>
  While the chest expands with its madd&rsquo;ning might,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>God&rsquo;s glorious oxygen</i>.</p>
<p>Thus the measur&rsquo;d stroke, on elastic  sward,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the steed three parts extended,<br>
  Hard held, the breath of his nostrils broad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the golden ether blended;<br>
  Then the leap, the rise from the springy turf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rush through the buoyant air,<br>
  And the light shock landing&mdash;the veriest serf<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is an emperor then and there!</p>
<p>Such scenes! sensation and sound and  sight!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To some undiscover&rsquo;d shore<br>
  On the current of Time&rsquo;s remorseless flight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have they swept to return no more?<br>
  While, like phantoms bright of the fever&rsquo;d night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That have vex&rsquo;d our slumbers of yore,<br>
  You follow us still in your ghostly might,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead days that have gone before.</p>
<p>Vain dreams, again and again re-told,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must you crowd on the weary brain,<br>
  Till the fingers are cold that entwin&rsquo;d of old<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round foil and trigger and rein,<br>
  Till stay&rsquo;d for aye are the roving feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the restless hands are quiet,<br>
  Till the stubborn heart has forgotten to beat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the hot blood has ceas&rsquo;d to riot?</p>
<p>In Exeter Hall the saint may chide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sinner may scoff outright,<br>
  The Bacchanal steep&rsquo;d in the flagon&rsquo;s tide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or the sensual Sybarite;<br>
  But&nbsp;<i>Nolan&rsquo;s</i>&nbsp;name will flourish in fame,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When our galloping days are past,<br>
  When we go to the place from whence we came,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance to find rest at last.</p>
<p>Thy riddles grow dark, oh! drifting cloud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thy misty shapes grow drear,<br>
  Thou hang&rsquo;st in the air like a shadowy shroud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I am of lighter cheer;<br>
  Though our future lot is a sable blot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the wise ones of earth will blame us,<br>
  Though our saddles will rot, and our rides be forgot,<br>

  Doubting oft, despairing never,<br>

  Like the marriage peal of fairies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes the tinkling sound,<br>
  Or like chimes of sweet St. Mary&rsquo;s<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On far English ground.<br>

  Laden with the dew of vespers,<br>

  In my ear the wind that whispers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems to make reply&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Question not, but live and labour<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yielded to a churl&rsquo;s embrace.<br>
  To a churl my vows were plighted,<br>
  Well my madness he requited,<br>
  Since, by priestly ties, united<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the muleteer&rsquo;s child;<br>
  And my prayers are wafted o&rsquo;er him,<br>
  That the bull may crush and gore him,<br>
  Since the love that once I bore him<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been changed to hatred wild.</p>
<p><b><i>Nina</i></b></p>
<p>Save  him! aid him! oh, Madonna!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two are slain if he is slain;<br>
  Shield his life, and guard his honour,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me not entreat in vain.<br>
  Sullenly the brindled savage<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears and tosses up the sand;<br>
  Horns that rend and hoofs that ravage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How shall man your shock withstand?<br>
  On the shaggy neck and head lie<br>
  Frothy flakes, the eyeballs redly<br>
  Flash, the horns so sharp and deadly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lower, short, and strong, and straight;<br>
  Fast, and furious, and fearless,<br>
  Now he charges;&mdash;virgin peerless,<br>
  Lifting lids, all dry and tearless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At thy throne I supplicate.</p>
<p><b><i>Francesca</i></b></p>
<p>Cool  and calm, the perjured varlet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stands on strongly-planted heel,<br>
  In his left a strip of scarlet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his right a streak of steel;<br>
  Ah! the monster topples over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till his haunches strike the plain!&mdash;<br>
  Low-born clown and lying lover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou hast conquer&rsquo;d once again.</p>
<p><b><i>Nina</i></b></p>
<p>Sweet  Madonna, maiden mother,<br>
  Thou hast saved him, and no other;<br>
  Now the tears I cannot smother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears of joy my vision blind;<br>
  Where thou sittest I am gazing,<br>
  These glad, misty eyes upraising,<br>
  I have pray&rsquo;d, and I am praising,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bless thee! bless thee! virgin kind.</p>
<p><b><i>Francesca</i></b></p>
<p>While  the crowd still sways and surges,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere the applauding shouts have ceas&rsquo;d,<br>
  See, the second bull emerges&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the famed Cordovan beast,&mdash;<br>
  By the picador ungoaded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scathless of the chulo&rsquo;s dart.<br>
  Slay him, and with guerdon loaded,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with honours crown&rsquo;d depart.<br>
  No vain brutish strife he wages,<br>
  Never uselessly he rages,<br>
  And his cunning, as he ages,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his hatred seems to grow;<br>
  Though he stands amid the cheering,<br>
  Sluggish to the eye appearing,<br>
  Few will venture on the spearing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of so resolute a foe.</p>
<p><b><i>Nina</i></b></p>
<p>Courage,  there is little danger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yonder dull-eyed craven seems<br>
  Fitter far for stall and manger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than for scarf and blade that gleams;<br>
  Shorter, and of frame less massive,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than his comrade lying low,<br>
  Tame, and cowardly, and passive,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He will prove a feebler foe.<br>
  I have done with doubt and anguish,<br>
  Fears like dews in sunshine languish,<br>
  Courage, husband, we shall vanquish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art calm and so am I.<br>
  For the rush he has not waited,<br>
  On he strides with step elated,<br>
  And the steel with blood unsated,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaps to end the butchery.</p>
<p><b><i>Francesca</i></b></p>
<p>Tyro!  mark the brands of battle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On those shoulders dusk and dun,<br>
  Such as he is are the cattle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skill&rsquo;d tauridors gladly shun;<br>
  Warier than the Andalusian,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swifter far, though not so large,<br>
  Think&rsquo;st thou, to his own confusion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He, like him, will blindly charge?<br>
  Inch by inch the brute advances,<br>
  Stealthy yet vindictive glances,<br>
  Horns as straight as levell&rsquo;d lances,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouching withers, stooping haunches;&mdash;<br>
  Closer yet, until the tightening<br>
  Strains of rapt excitement height&rsquo;ning<br>
  Grows oppressive. Ha! like lightning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his enemy he launches.</p>
<p><b><i>Nina</i></b></p>
<p>O&rsquo;er  the horn&rsquo;d front drops the streamer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the nape the sharp steel hisses,<br>
  Glances, grazes,&mdash;Christ! Redeemer!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a hair the spine he misses.</p>
<p><b><i>Francesca</i></b></p>
<p>Hark!  that shock like muffled thunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booming from the Pyrenees!<br>
  Both are down&mdash;the man is under&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now he struggles to his knees,<br>
  Now he sinks, his features leaden<br>
  Sharpen rigidly and deaden,<br>
  Sands beneath him soak and redden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skies above him spin and veer;<br>
  Through the doublet torn and riven,<br>
  Where the stunted horn was driven,<br>
  Wells the life-blood&mdash;We are even,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter of the muleteer!</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Fauconshawe"></a>Fauconshawe</b></h2>
<p align="center" class="note">[A Ballad]</p>
<p>To&nbsp;fetch clear water  out of the spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little maid  Margaret ran;<br>
  From the stream to the castle&rsquo;s western wing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was but a bowshot  span;<br>
  On the sedgy brink where the osiers cling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay a dead man, pallid  and wan. </p>
<p>The lady Mabel rose from her bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And walked in the castle hall,<br>
  Where the porch through the western turret led<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She met with her handmaid small.<br>
  &ldquo;What aileth thee, Margaret?&rdquo; the lady said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hast let thy pitcher fall?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what hast thou seen by the streamlet  side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nymph or a water sprite?<br>
  That thou comest with eyes so wild and wide,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with cheeks so ghostly white?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Nor nymph nor sprite,&rdquo; the maiden cried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;But the corpse of a slaughtered knight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady Mabel summon&rsquo;d straight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To her presence Sir Hugh de Vere,<br>
  Of the guests who tarried within the gate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Fauconshawe most dear<br>
  Was he to that lady; betrothed in state<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had been since many a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Margaret sayeth a dead man lies<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the western spring, Sir Hugh;<br>
  I can scarce believe that the maiden lies&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet scarce can believe her true.&rdquo;<br>
  And the knight replies, &ldquo;Till we test her eyes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let her words gain credence due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the rocky path knight and lady led,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While guests and retainers bold<br>
  Followed in haste, for like wildfire spread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The news by the maiden told.<br>
  They found &rsquo;twas even as she had said&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The corpse had some while been cold.</p>
<p>How the spirit had pass&rsquo;d in the moments  last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was little trace to reveal:<br>
  On the still calm face lay no imprint ghast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save the angel&rsquo;s solemn seal,<br>
  Yet the hands were clench&rsquo;d in a death-grip fast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sods stamp&rsquo;d down by the heel.</p>
<p>Sir Hugh by the side of the dead man  knelt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said, &ldquo;Full well these features I know,<br>
  We have faced each other where blows were dealt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was a stalwart foe;<br>
  I had rather have met him hilt to hilt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than have found him lying low.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turn&rsquo;d the body up on its face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never a word was spoken,<br>
  While he ripp&rsquo;d the doublet, and tore the lace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And tugg&rsquo;d&mdash;by the self-same token,&mdash;<br>
  And strain&rsquo;d, till he wrench&rsquo;d it out of its place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dagger-blade that was broken.</p>
<p>Then he turned the body over again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And said, while he rose upright,<br>
  &ldquo;May the brand of Cain, with its withering stain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the murderer&rsquo;s forehead light,<br>
  For he never was slain on the open plain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet in the open fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Solemn and stern were the words he spoke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he look&rsquo;d at his lady&rsquo;s men,<br>
  But his speech no answering echoes woke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All were silent there and then,<br>
  Till a clear, cold voice the silence broke:&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lady Mabel cried, &ldquo;Amen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His glance met hers, the twain stood  hush&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dead between them there;<br>
  But the blood to her snowy temples rush&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it tinged the roots of her hair,<br>
  Then paled, but a thin red streak still flush&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the midst of her forehead fair.</p>
<p>Four yeomen raised the corpse from the  ground,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a sign from Sir Hugh de Vere;<br>
  It was borne to the western turret round,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And laid on a knightly bier,<br>
  With never a sob nor a mourning sound,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No friend to the dead was near.</p>
<p>Yet that night was neither revel nor dance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the halls of Fauconshawe;<br>
  Men looked askance with a doubtful glance<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Sir Hugh, for they stood in awe<br>
  Of his prowess, but he, like one in a trance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarded naught that he saw.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>Night black and chill, wind gathering still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its wail in the  turret tall,<br>
  And its headlong blast like a catapult cast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the crest of the  outer wall,<br>
  And its hail and rain on the crashing pane,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the glassy  splinters fall. </p>
<p>A moody knight by the fitful light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the great hall fire below;<br>
  A corpse upstairs, and a woman at prayers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will they profit her, aye or no?<br>
  By&rsquo;r lady fain, an&rsquo; she comfort gain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is comfort for us also.</p>
<p>The guests were gone, save Sir Hugh alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he watched the gleams that broke<br>
  On the pale hearth-stone, and flickered and shone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the panels of polish&rsquo;d oak;<br>
  He was &rsquo;ware of no presence except his own<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the voice of young Margaret spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve risen, Sir Hugh, at the mirk  midnight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot sleep in my bed,<br>
  Now, unless my tale can be told aright,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wot it were best unsaid;<br>
  It lies, the blood of yon northern knight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On my lady&rsquo;s hand and head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! the wild wind raves and rushes along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But thy ravings seem more wild&mdash;<br>
  She never could do so foul a wrong&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet I blame thee not, my child,<br>
  For the fever&rsquo;d dreams on thy rest that throng!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He frown&rsquo;d though his speech was mild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let storm winds eddy, and scream, and hurl<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wrath, they disturb me naught;<br>
  The daughter she of a high-born earl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No secret of hers I&rsquo;ve sought;<br>
  I am but the child of a peasant churl,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet look to the proofs I&rsquo;ve brought;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This dagger snapp&rsquo;d so close to the hilt&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dost remember thy token well?<br>
  Will it match with the broken blade that spilt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His life in the western dell?<br>
  Nay! read her handwriting an&rsquo; thou wilt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From her paramour&rsquo;s breast it fell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight in silence the letter read,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the characters well he knew!<br>
  And his face might have match&rsquo;d the face of the dead,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So ashen white was its hue!<br>
  Then he tore the parchment shred by shred,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the strips in the flames he threw.</p>
<p>And he muttered, &ldquo;Densely those shadows  fall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the copse where the alders thicken;<br>
  There she bade him come to her, once for all&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I well may shudder and sicken;&mdash;<br>
  Gramercy! that hand so white and small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How strongly it must have stricken.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * * * * * *</b></p>
<p>At midnight hour, in the western tower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone with the dead  man there,<br>
  Lady Mabel kneels, nor heeds nor feels<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shock of the  rushing air,<br>
  Though the gusts that pass through the riven  glass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have scattered her  raven hair. </p>
<p>Across the floor, through the opening  door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where standeth a stately knight,<br>
  The lamplight streams, and flickers, and gleams,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his features stern and white&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis Sir Hugh de Vere, and he cometh more near,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the lady standeth upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis little,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I know or  care<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the guilt (if guilt there be)<br>
  That lies &rsquo;twixt thee and yon dead man there,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor matters it now to me;<br>
  I thought thee pure, thou art only fair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to-morrow I cross the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He perish&rsquo;d! I ask not why or how?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I come to recall my troth;<br>
  Take back, my lady, thy broken vow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give back my allegiance oath;<br>
  Let the past be buried between us now<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever&mdash;&rsquo;tis best for both.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet, Mabel, I could ask, dost thou dare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lay hand on that corpse&rsquo;s heart,<br>
  And call on thy Maker, and boldly swear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou hadst in his death no part?<br>
  I ask not, while threescore proofs I share<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With one doubt&mdash;uncondemn&rsquo;d thou art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! cold and bleak upon Mabel&rsquo;s cheek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Came the blast of the storm-wind keen,<br>
  And her tresses black, as the glossy back<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the raven, glanced between<br>
  Her fingers slight, like the ivory white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she parted their sable sheen.</p>
<p>Yet with steady lip, and with fearless  eye,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with cheek like the flush of dawn,<br>
  Unflinchingly she spoke in reply&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Go hence with the break of morn,<br>
  I will neither confess, nor yet deny,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will return thee scorn for scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight bow&rsquo;d low as he turn&rsquo;d to go;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He travell&rsquo;d by land and sea,<br>
  But naught of his future fate I know,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And naught of his fair ladye;&mdash;<br>
  My story is told as, long ago,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My story was told to me.</p>

  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mend the old roof-tree,&rdquo; so he said,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the dreamer, waiting for time and tide,<br>
  For awhile may shirk his share of the work,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he grows with his dream dissatisfied;<br>
  He may climb to the edge of the beetling ledge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the loose crag topples and well-nigh reels<br>
  &rsquo;Neath the lashing gale, but the tonic will fail&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does it profit?&mdash;Wheels within wheels!</p>
<p>Aye! work we must, or with idlers rust,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eat we must our bodies to nurse;<br>
  Some folk grow fatter&mdash;what does it matter?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m blest if I do&mdash;quite the reverse;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a weary round to which we are bound,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing over and over again;<br>
  Much toil and trouble, and a glittering bubble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That rises and bursts is the best we gain;<br>
  And we murmur, and yet &rsquo;tis certain we get<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What good we deserve&mdash;can we hope for more?&mdash;<br>
  They are roaring, those waves, in their echoing caves&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To whom do they profit?&mdash;Let them roar!</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False goddess, fair statue of strife,<br>
  Yet standest on pedestal massive,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A symbol and token of life.<br>
  Thou art still, not with stillness of languor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And calm, not with calm boding rest;<br>
  For thine is all wrath and all anger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That throbs far and near in the breast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of man, by thy presence possess&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>With the brow of a fallen archangel,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lips of a beautiful fiend,<br>
  And locks that are snake-like to strangle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And eyes from whose depths may be glean&rsquo;d<br>
  The presence of passions, that tremble<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbidden, yet shine as they may<br>
  Through features too proud to dissemble,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too cold and too calm to betray<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their secrets to creatures of clay.</p>
<p>Thy breath stirreth faction and party,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men rise, and no voice can avail<br>
  To stay them&mdash;rose-tinted Astarte<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herself at thy presence turns pale.<br>
  For deeper and richer the crimson<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gathers behind thee throws forth<br>
  A halo thy raiment and limbs on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaves a red track in the path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That flows from thy wine-press of wrath.</p>
<p>For behind thee red rivulets trickle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men fall by thy hands swift and lithe,<br>
  As corn falleth down to the sickle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As grass falleth down to the scythe,<br>
  Thine arm, strong and cruel, and shapely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts high the sharp, pitiless lance,<br>
  And rapine and ruin and rape lie<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around thee. The Furies advance,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ares awakes from his trance.</p>
<p>We, too, with our bodies thus weakly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hearts hard and dangerous, thus<br>
  We owe thee&mdash;the saints suffered meekly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their wrongs&mdash;it is not so with us.<br>
  Some share of thy strength thou hast given<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mortals refusing in vain<br>
  Thine aid. We have suffered and striven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we have grown reckless of pain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though feeble of heart and of brain.</p>
<p>Fair spirit, alluring if wicked,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;False deity, terribly real,<br>
  Our senses are trapp&rsquo;d, our souls tricked<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By thee and thy hollow ideal.<br>
  The soldier who falls in his harness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strikes his last stroke with slack hand,<br>
  On his dead face thy wrath and thy scorn is<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imprinted. Oh! seeks he a land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where he shall escape thy command?</p>
<p>When the blood of thy victims lies red on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That stricken field, fiercest and last,<br>
  In the sunset that gilds Armageddon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With battle-drift still overcast&mdash;<br>
  When the smoke of thy hot conflagrations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;ershadows the earth as with wings,<br>
  Where nations have fought against nations,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And kings have encounter&rsquo;d with kings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When cometh the end of all things&mdash;</p>
<p>Then those who have patiently waited,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And borne, unresisting, the pain<br>
  Of thy vengeance unglutted, unsated,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall they be rewarded again?<br>
  Then those who, enticed by thy laurels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or urged by thy promptings unblest,<br>
  Have striven and stricken in quarrels,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall they, too, find pardon and rest?<br>
  We know not, yet hope for the best.</p>

<p>White&nbsp;steeds of ocean,  that leap with a hollow and wearisome roar<br>
  On the bar of ironstone steep, not a fathom&rsquo;s  length from the shore,<br>
  Is there never a seer nor sophist can  interpret your wild refrain,<br>
  When speech, the harshest and roughest is  seldom studied in vain;<br>
  My ears are constantly smitten by that dreary  monotone,<br>
  In a hieroglyphic &rsquo;tis written&mdash;&rsquo;tis spoken in  a tongue unknown;<br>
  Gathering, growing, and swelling, and surging,  and shivering, say!<br>
  What is the tale you are telling? What is the  drift of your lay? </p>
<p>You come, and your crests are hoary with  the foam of your countless years;<br>
  You break, with a rainbow of glory, through the spray of your glittering tears.<br>
  Is your song a song of gladness? a p&aelig;an of joyous might?<br>
  Or a wail of discordant sadness for the wrongs you never can right?<br>
  For the empty seat by the ingle? for children reft of their sire?<br>
  For the bride, sitting sad, and single, and pale, by the flickering fire?<br>
  For your ravenous pools of suction? for your shattering billow swell?<br>
  For your ceaseless work of destruction? for your hunger insatiable?</p>
<p>Not far from this very place, on the sand  and the shingle dry,<br>
  He lay, with his batter&rsquo;d face upturned to the frowning sky.<br>
  When your waters wash&rsquo;d and swill&rsquo;d high over his drowning head,<br>
  When his nostrils and lungs were fill&rsquo;d, when his feet and hands were as lead,<br>
  When against the rock he was hurl&rsquo;d, and suck&rsquo;d again to the sea,<br>
  On the shores of another world, on the brink of eternity,<br>
  On the verge of annihilation, did it come to that swimmer strong,<br>
  The sudden interpretation of your mystical, weird-like song?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortal! that which thou askest, ask not  thou of the waves;<br>
  Fool! thou foolishly taskest us&mdash;we are only slaves;<br>
  Might, more mighty, impels us&mdash;we must our lot fulfil,<br>
  He who gathers and swells us curbs us, too, at His will.<br>
  Think&rsquo;st thou the wave that shatters questioneth His decree?<br>
  Little to us it matters, and naught it matters to thee.<br>
  Not thus, murmuring idly, we from our duty would swerve,<br>
  Over the world spread widely ever we labour and serve.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little hope or comfort here below;<br>

  Tho&rsquo; the bar of the bay is fleck&rsquo;d with white,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind is  fitfully wailing;<br>
  Near the tiller stands the priest, and the  knight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leans over the  quarter-railing. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is time while the vessel tarries  still,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is time while her shrouds are slack,<br>

  Ere her tall masts vanish from town and from hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ere cleaves to her keel the track:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To those who may never come back.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naught done that thou should&rsquo;st have left?<br>
  The guiltiest soul may from guilt be won,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stoniest heart may be cleft.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I wot, she prayeth in vain!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I hear it over the battle&rsquo;s din,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And over the festive cheer,&mdash;<br>
  So she pray&rsquo;d with clasp&rsquo;d hands, white and thin,&mdash;<br>
  The prayer of a soul absolved from sin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a soul that is dark and drear,<br>
  For the light of repentance bursting in,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the flood of the blinding tear.</p>

  I hold your comfort a broken reed;<br>
  Let the wither&rsquo;d branch for itself take heed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the green shoots wait your care;<br>
  I&rsquo;ve striven, though feebly, to grasp your creed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;ve grappled my own despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the little within thee, good and  brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not wholly shattered, though shaken;<br>
  By the soul that crieth beyond the grave,<br>
  The love that He once in His mercy gave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In His mercy since retaken,<br>
  I conjure thee, oh! sinner, pardon crave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I implore thee, oh! sleeper, waken!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to! shall I lay my black soul bare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a vain, self-righteous man?<br>
  In my sin, in my sorrow, you may not share,<br>
  And yet could I meet with one who must bear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The load of an equal ban,<br>
  With him I might strive to blend one prayer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wail of the Publican.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, I, too, am a withered bough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My place is to others given;<br>
  Thou hast sinn&rsquo;d, thou sayest; I ask not how,<br>

<p>Strong chest, where her drapery rustles,<br>

  The valour from virtue that sunders,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heed not the faint clash of the shears.<br>
  It comes!&mdash;with the gleam of the lamps on<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The curtains&mdash;that voice&mdash;does it jar<br>
  On thy soul in the night-watch? Ho! Samson,<br>

<p>The storm went forth to the forest, the  plague went forth to the town,<br>

<p>Then the rays of the sunset glinted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the blackwoods&rsquo; emerald bough<br>
  On an emerald sward, rose-tinted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And spangled, and gemm&rsquo;d;&mdash;and now<br>
  The rays of the sunset redden<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a sullen and lurid frown,<br>
  From the skies that are dark and leaden,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To earth that is dusk and brown.</p>
<p>To right and to left extended<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uplands are blank and drear,<br>
  And their neutral tints are blended<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the dead leaves sombre and sere;<br>
  The cold grey mist from the still side<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the lake creeps sluggish and sure,<br>
  Bare and bleak is the hill-side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barren and bleak the moor.</p>
<p>Bright hues and shapes intertwisted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fair forms and rich colours;&mdash;now<br>

<p>What might have been!&mdash;words of folly;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What might be!&mdash;speech for a fool;<br>
  With mistletoe round me, and holly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarlet and green, at Yule.<br>
  With the elm in the place of the wattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And in lieu of the gum, the oak,<br>
  Years back I believed a little,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as I believed I spoke.</p>
<p>Have I done with those childish fancies?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They suited the days gone by,<br>
  When I pulled the poppies and pansies,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I hunted the butterfly,<br>
  With one who has long been sleeping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stranger to doubts and cares,<br>
  And to sowing that ends in reaping<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thistles, and thorns, and tares.</p>
<p>What might be!&mdash;the dreams were scatter&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As chaff is toss&rsquo;d by the wind,<br>
  The faith has been rudely shattered<br>

  Things were to have been, and therefore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were, and they are to be,<br>
  And will be;&mdash;we must prepare for<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doom we are bound to dree.</p>
<p>Ah, me! we believe in evil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where once we believed in good,<br>
  The world, the flesh, and the devil<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are easily understood;<br>
  The world, the flesh, and the devil<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their traces on earth are plain;<br>
  Must they always riot and revel<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While footprints of man remain?</p>
<p>Talk about better and wiser,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiser and worse are one,<br>
  The sophist is the despiser<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all things under the sun;<br>
  Is nothing real but confusion?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nothing certain but death?<br>
  Is nothing fair save illusion?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is nothing good that has breath?</p>
<p>Some sprite, malignant and elfish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seems present whispering close,<br>
  &ldquo;All motives of life are selfish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All instincts of life are gross;<br>

  The weary longings and yearnings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mystical better things,<br>
  Are the sands on which is reflected<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pitiless moving lake,<br>
  Where the wanderer falls dejected,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a thirst he never can slake.</p>
<p>A child blows bubbles that glitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He snatches them, they disperse;<br>
  Yet childhood&rsquo;s folly is better,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And manhood&rsquo;s folly is worse;<br>
  Gilt baubles we grasp at blindly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would turn in our hands to dross;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a fate less cruel than kindly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Denies the gain and the loss.</p>
<p>And as one who pursues a shadow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one who hunts in a dream,<br>
  As the child who crosses the meadow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enticed by the rainbow&rsquo;s gleam,<br>
  I&mdash;knowing the course was foolish,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guessing the goal was pain,<br>
  Stupid, and stubborn, and mulish&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Followed and follow again.</p>
<p>The sun over Gideon halted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding aloof the night,<br>
  When Joshua&rsquo;s arm was exalted,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet never retraced his flight;<br>
  Nor will he turn back, nor can he,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He chases the future fast;<br>
  The future is blank&mdash;oh, Annie!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fain would recall the past.</p>
<p>There are others toiling and straining<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath burdens graver than mine&mdash;<br>
  They are weary, yet uncomplaining&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it, yet I repine;<br>
  I know it, how time will ravage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How time will level, and yet<br>
  I long with a longing savage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I regret with a fierce regret.</p>
<p>You are no false ideal,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something is left of you,<br>
  Present, perceptible, real,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Palpable, tangible, true;<br>
  One shred of your broken necklace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One tress of your pale, gold hair,<br>
  And a heart so utterly reckless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the worst it would gladly dare.</p>
<p>There is little pleasure, if any,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In waking the past anew;<br>
  My days and nights have been many;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost chances many I rue&mdash;<br>
  My days and nights have been many;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I pray that they be few,<br>
  When I think on the hill-side, Annie,<br>

<p>Our&nbsp;hopes are wild  imaginings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our schemes are airy  castles,<br>
  Yet these, on earth, are lords and kings,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we their slaves  and vassals;<br>
  Your dream, forsooth, of buoyant youth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most ready to deceive  is;<br>
  But age will own the bitter truth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita brevis</i>.&rdquo; </p>
<p>The hill of life with eager feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We climbed in merry morning,<br>
  But on the downward track we meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shades of twilight warning;<br>
  The shadows gaunt they fall aslant;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those who scaled Ben Nevis,<br>
  Against the mole-hills toil and pant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The obstacles that barr&rsquo;d our path<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seldom quail&rsquo;d to dash on<br>
  In youth, for youth one motto hath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The will, the way must fashion.&rdquo;<br>
  Those words, I wot, blood thick and hot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too ready to believe is,<br>
  But thin and cold our blood hath got,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;art is long&rdquo;, and &ldquo;life is short&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And man is slow at learning;<br>
  And yet by divers dealings taught,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For divers follies yearning,<br>
  He owns at last, with grief downcast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(For man disposed to grieve is)&mdash;<br>
  One adage old stands true and fast,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We journey, manhood, youth, and age,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matron, and the maiden,<br>
  Like pilgrims on a pilgrimage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loins girded, heavy laden:&mdash;<br>
  Each pilgrim strong, who joins our throng,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most eager to achieve is,<br>
  Foredoom&rsquo;d ere long to swell the song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At morn, with staff and sandal-shoon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We travel brisk and cheery,<br>
  But some have laid them down ere noon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all at eve are weary;<br>
  The noontide glows with no repose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bitter chill the eve is,<br>
  The grasshopper a burden grows,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The staff is snapp&rsquo;d, the sandal fray&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flint-stone galls and blisters,<br>
  Our brother&rsquo;s steps we cannot aid,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah me! nor aid our sister&rsquo;s;<br>
  The pit prepares its hidden snares,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rock prepared to cleave is,<br>
  We cry, in falling unawares,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh! Wisdom, which we sought to win!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! Strength, in which we trusted!<br>
  Oh! Glory, which we gloried in!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! puppets we adjusted!<br>
  On barren land our seed is sand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And torn the web we weave is,<br>
  The bruised reed hath pierced the hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Ars longa, vita  brevis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We, too, &ldquo;Job&rsquo;s comforters&rdquo; have met,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With steps, like ours, unsteady,<br>
  They could not help themselves, and yet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To judge us they were ready;<br>
  Life&rsquo;s path is trod at last, and God<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More ready to reprieve is,<br>
  They know who rest beneath the sod,<br>

<p>All is over! this is death,<br>

  Brave old horse! with &rsquo;bated breath<br>
  Hardly drawn through tight-clenched teeth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lip indented deep, but eye<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only dull and dry.</p>
<p>Musing on the husk and chaff<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather&rsquo;d where life&rsquo;s tares are sown,<br>
  Thus I speak, and force a laugh<br>
  That is half a sneer and half<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An involuntary groan,<br>

<p>&ldquo;Rest, old friend! thy day, though rife<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the pantomime of noon<br>

<p>&ldquo;With the flash that ends thy pain<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And shiver their frothy spray,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That gathers and flits away,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stem of the &ldquo;ancient clay.&rdquo;</p>

  The racers stripp&rsquo;t for the &ldquo;Melbourne Cup&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All gloss and polish and lustre;<br>
  And the course is seen, with its emerald sheen,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the bright spring-tide renew&rsquo;d,<br>
  Like a ribbon of green stretched out between<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ranks of the multitude.</p>
<p>The flag is lowered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re off!&rdquo; &ldquo;They come!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The squadron is sweeping on;<br>
  A sway in the crowd&mdash;a murmuring hum!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re past!&rdquo; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re gone!&rdquo;<br>
  They came with the rush of the southern surf,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bar of the storm-girt bay;<br>
  And like muffled drums on the sounding turf<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their hoof-strokes echo away.</p>
<p>The rose and black draws clear of the ruck,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the murmur swells to a roar,<br>
  As the brave old colours that never were struck,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are seen with the lead once more.<br>
  Though the feathery ferns and grasses wave<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the sod where Lantern sleeps,<br>
  Though the turf is green on Fisherman&rsquo;s grave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stable its prestige keeps.</p>
<p>Six lengths in front she scours along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;s bringing the field to trouble;<br>
  She&rsquo;s tailing them off, she&rsquo;s running strong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She shakes her head and pulls double.<br>
  Now Minstrel falters and Exile flags,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Barb finds the pace too hot,<br>
  And Toryboy loiters, and Playboy lags,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the&nbsp;<i>bolt</i>&nbsp;of Ben Bolt is shot.</p>
<p>That she never may be caught this day,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the worst that the public wish her.<br>
  She won&rsquo;t be caught: she comes right away;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hurrah for Seagull and Fisher!<br>
  See, Strop falls back, though his reins are slack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sultana begins to tire,<br>
  And the top-weight tells on the Sydney crack,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pace on &ldquo;the Gipps Land  flyer&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The rowels, as round the turn they sweep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just graze Tim Whiffler&rsquo;s flanks;<br>
  Like the hunted deer that flies through the sheep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strides through the beaten ranks.<br>
  Daughter of Omen, prove your birth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The colt will take lots of choking;<br>
  The hot breath steams at your saddle girth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From his scarlet nostril smoking.</p>
<p>The shouts of the Ring for a space subside,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And slackens the bookmaker&rsquo;s roar;<br>
  Now, Davis,  rally; now, Carter, ride,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As man never rode before.<br>
  When Sparrowhawk&rsquo;s backers cease to cheer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Yattendon&rsquo;s friends are dumb,<br>
  When hushed is the clamour for Volunteer&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alone in the race they come!</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re neck and neck; they&rsquo;re head and head;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;re stroke for stroke in the running;<br>
  The whalebone whistles, the steel is red,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No shirking as yet nor shunning.<br>
  One effort, Seagull, the blood you boast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should struggle when nerves are strained;&mdash;<br>
  With a rush on the post, by a neck at the most,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The verdict for Tim is gained.</p>
<p>Tim Whiffler wins. Is blood alone<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>sine qua non</i> for a flyer?<br>
  The breed of his dam is a myth unknown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we&rsquo;ve doubts respecting his sire.<br>
  Yet few (if any) those proud names are,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the pages of peerage or stud,<br>
  In whose &rsquo;scutcheon lurks no sinister bar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No taint of the base black blood.</p>
<p>Aye, Shorthouse, laugh&mdash;laugh loud and long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For pedigree you&rsquo;re a sticker;<br>
  You may be right, I may be wrong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wiseacres both! Let&rsquo;s liquor.<br>
  Our common descent we may each recall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To a lady of old caught tripping,<br>
  The fair one in fig leaves, who d&mdash;&mdash;d us all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a bite at a golden pippin.</p>
<p>When first on this rocky ledge I lay,<br>
  There was scarce a ripple in yonder bay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The air was serenely still;<br>
  Each column that sailed from my swarthy clay<br>
  Hung loitering long ere it passed away,<br>
  Though the skies wore a tinge of leaden grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the atmosphere was chill.<br>
  But the red sun sank to his evening shroud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the western billows are roll&rsquo;d,<br>
  Behind a curtain of sable cloud,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a fringe of scarlet and gold;<br>
  There&rsquo;s a misty glare in the yellow moon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the drift is scudding fast,<br>
  There&rsquo;ll be storm, and rattle, and tempest soon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the heavens are overcast.<br>
  The neutral tint of the sullen sea<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is fleck&rsquo;d with the snowy foam,<br>
  And the distant gale sighs drearilie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the wanderer sighs for his home.<br>
  The white sea-horses toss their manes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bar of the southern reef,<br>
  And the breakers moan, and&mdash;by Jove, it rains<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I thought I should come to grief);<br>
  Though it can&rsquo;t well damage my shabby hat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though my coat looks best when it&rsquo;s damp;<br>
  Since the shaking I got (no matter where at),<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve a mortal dread of the cramp.<br>
  My matches are wet, my pipe&rsquo;s put out,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wind blows colder and stronger;<br>
  I&rsquo;ll be stiff, and sore, and sorry, no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I lie here any longer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheFieldsofColeraine"></a>The Fields of  Coleraine</b> </h2>
<p>On the fields of Col&rsquo;raine there&rsquo;ll be labour in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Great Western is ended,<br>
  The nags will have toil&rsquo;d, and the silks will be soil&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rails will require to be mended.</p>
<p>For the gullies are deep, and the uplands are steep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mud will of purls be the token,<br>
  And the tough stringy-bark, that invites us to lark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With impunity may not be broken.</p>
<p>Though Ballarat&rsquo;s fast, and they say he can last,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that may be granted hereafter,<br>
  Yet the judge&rsquo;s decision to the Border division<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will bring neither shouting nor laughter.</p>
<p>And Blueskin, I&rsquo;ve heard that he goes like a bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m told that to back him would pay me;<br>
  He&rsquo;s a good bit of stuff, but not quite good enough,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;<i>Non licuit  credere fam&oelig;</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alfred ought to be there, we all of us swear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the blood of King Alfred, his sire;<br>
  He&rsquo;s not the real jam, by the blood of his dam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t put him down as a flyer.</p>
<p>Now, Hynam, my boy, I wish you great joy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that when fresh you can jump, sir;<br>
  But you&rsquo;ll scarce be in clover, when you&rsquo;re ridden all over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And punish&rsquo;t from shoulder to rump, sir.</p>
<p>Archer goes like a shot, they can put on their pot,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And boil it to cover expenses;<br>
  Their pot will boil over, the run of his Dover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&rsquo;ll never earn over big fences.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a horse in the race, with a blaze on his face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we know he can gallop a docker!<br>
  He&rsquo;s proved himself stout, of his speed there&rsquo;s no doubt,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And his jumping&rsquo;s according to Cocker.</p>
<p>When Hynam&rsquo;s outstrip&rsquo;t, and when Alfred is whip&rsquo;t,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep him in sight of the leaders,<br>
  While Blueskin runs true, but his backers look blue,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his rider&rsquo;s at work with the bleeders;</p>
<p>When his carcase of beef brings &ldquo;the bullock&rdquo; to grief,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the rush of the tartan is ended;<br>
  When Archer&rsquo;s in trouble&mdash;who&rsquo;s that pulling double,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And taking his leaps unextended?</p>
<p>He wins all the way, and the rest&mdash;sweet, they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the smell of the newly-turned plough, friend,<br>
  But you smell it too close when it stops eyes and nose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you can&rsquo;t tell your horse from your cow, friend.</p>

<p>Dear Bell,&mdash;I enclose what you ask in a letter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short rhyme at random, no more and no less,<br>
  And you may insert it, for want of a better,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or leave it, it doesn&rsquo;t much matter, I guess;<br>
  And as for a tip, why, there isn&rsquo;t much in it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may hit the right nail, but first, I declare,<br>
  I haven&rsquo;t a notion what&rsquo;s going to win it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(The Champion, I mean), and what&rsquo;s more, I don&rsquo;t care.<br>
  Imprimis, there&rsquo;s Cowra&mdash;few nags can go quicker<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than she can&mdash;and Smith takes his oath she can fly;<br>
  While Brown, Jones, and Robinson swear she&rsquo;s a sticker,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &ldquo;<i>cr&aelig;dat Jud&aelig;us Apella</i>&rdquo;, say I.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s old Volunteer, I&rsquo;d be sorry to sneer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his chance; he&rsquo;ll be there, if he goes at the rate<br>
  He went at last year, when a customer queer,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Johnny Higgerson, fancied him lock&rsquo;d in the straight;<br>
  I&rsquo;ve heard that the old horse has never been fitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve heard all performances past he&rsquo;ll outvie;<br>
  He may gallop a docker, and finish a splitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But &ldquo;<i>cr&aelig;dat Jud&aelig;us Apella</i>&rdquo;, say I.</p>
<p>I know what they say, sir, &ldquo;The Hook&rdquo; he can stay, sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stick to his work like a sleuth-hound or beagle;<br>
  He stays &ldquo;with a&nbsp;<i>hook</i>&rdquo;, and he sticks in the clay, sir;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d rather, for choice, pop my money on Seagull;<br>
  I&rsquo;m told that the Sydney division will rue, sir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their rashness in front of the stand when they spy,<br>
  With a clear lead, the white jacket spotted with blue, sir,<br>

<p>There&rsquo;s The Barb&mdash;you may talk of your flyers and stayers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All bosh&mdash;when he strips you can see his eye range<br>
  Round his rivals, with much the same look as Tom Sayers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once wore when he faced the big novice, Bill Bainge.<br>
  Like Stow, at our hustings, confronting the hisses<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of roughs, with his queer Mephistopheles&rsquo; smile;<br>
  Like Baker, or Baker&rsquo;s more wonderful&nbsp;<i>Mrs</i>.,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terror of blacks at the source of the Nile;<br>
  Like Triton &lsquo;mid minnows; like hawk among chickens;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like&mdash;anything better than everything else:<br>
  He stands at the post. Now they&rsquo;re off! the plot thickens!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quoth Stanley to Davis,  &ldquo;How is your pulse?&rdquo;<br>
  He skims o&rsquo;er the smooth turf, he scuds through the mire,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waits with them, passes them, bids them good-bye!<br>
  Two miles and three-quarters, cries Filgate, &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll tire.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! &ldquo;<i>cr&aelig;dat Jud&aelig;us Apella</i>&rdquo;, say I.</p>
<p>Lest my tale should come true, let me give you fair warning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may &ldquo;shout&rdquo; some cheroots, if you like, no  champagne<br>
  For this child&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! think of my head in the morning,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Old chap, you don&rsquo;t get me on that lay again.<br>
  The last time those games I look&rsquo;d likely to try on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says Bradshawe, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll feel very sheepish and shy<br>
  When you are haul&rsquo;d up and caution&rsquo;d by D&mdash;g&mdash;y and L&mdash;n,&rdquo;<br>

<p>This writing bad verses is very fatiguing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brain and the liver against it combine,<br>
  And nerves with digestion in concert are leaguing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To punish excess in the pen and ink line;<br>
  Already I feel just as if I&rsquo;d been rowing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard all&mdash;on a supper of onions and tripe<br>
  (A thing I abhor), but my steam I&rsquo;ve done blowing,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swear that a cripple is sound&mdash;on the Bible&mdash;<br>
  Hold hard! though the man I allude to is soft,<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BankersDream"></a>Banker&rsquo;s Dream</b></h2>
<p>Of chases and courses dogs dream, so do horses&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night I was dozing and dreaming,<br>
  The crowd and the bustle were there, and the rustle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the silk in the autumn sky gleaming.</p>
<p>The stand throng&rsquo;d with faces, the broadcloth and laces,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The booths, and the tents, and the cars,<br>
  The bookmakers&rsquo; jargon, for odds making bargain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nasty stale smell of cigars.</p>
<p>We formed into line, &rsquo;neath the merry sunshine,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Near the logs at the end of the railing;<br>
  &ldquo;Are you ready, boys? Go!&rdquo; cried the starter, and low<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sank the flag, and away we went sailing.</p>
<p>In the van of the battle we heard the stones rattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some slogging was done, but no slaughter,<br>
  A shout from the stand, and the whole of our band<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skimm&rsquo;d merrily over the water.</p>
<p>Two fences we clear&rsquo;d, and the roadway we near&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When three of our troop came to trouble;<br>
  Like a bird on the wing, or a stone from a sling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flew Cadger, first over the double.</p>
<p>And Western was there, head and tail in the air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Pondon was there, too&mdash;what noodle<br>
  Could so name a horse? I should feel some remorse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I gave such a name to a poodle.</p>
<p>In and out of the lane, to the racecourse again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig&rsquo;s pony was first, I was third,<br>
  And Ingleside lit in my tracks, with the bit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his teeth, and came up &ldquo;like a bird&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In the van of the battle we heard the rails rattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he, &ldquo;Though I don&rsquo;t care for shunning<br>
  My share of the raps, I shall look out for gaps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the light weight&rsquo;s away with the running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the fence just ahead the outsider still led,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chestnut play&rsquo;d follow my leader;<br>
  Oh! the devil a gap, he went into it slap,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he and his jock took a header.</p>
<p>Says Ingleside, &ldquo;Mate, should the pony go straight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ve no time to stop or turn restive;&rdquo;<br>
  Says I, &ldquo;Who means to stop? I shall go till I drop;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Says he, &ldquo;Go it, old cuss, gay and festive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fence stiff and tall, just beyond the log wall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cross&rsquo;d, and the walls, and the water,&mdash;<br>
  I took off too near, a small made fence to clear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And just touch&rsquo;d the grass with my snorter.</p>
<p>At the next post and rail up went Western&rsquo;s bang tail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And down (by the very same token)<br>
  To earth went his nose, for the panel he chose<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood firm and refused to be broken.</p>
<p>I dreamt someone said that the bay would have made<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The race safe if he&rsquo;d&nbsp;<i>stood</i>&nbsp;a while  longer;<br>
  <i>If</i>&nbsp;he had,&mdash;but, like if, there the panel stands stiff&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood, but the panel stood stronger.</p>
<p>In and out of the road, with a clear lead still show&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The violet fluted with amber;<br>
  Says Johnson, &ldquo;Old man, catch him now if you can,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis the second time round you&rsquo;ll remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the road once again, pulling hard on the rein,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Craig&rsquo;s pony pop&rsquo;t in and pop&rsquo;t out;<br>
  I followed like smoke and the pace was no joke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For his friends were beginning to shout.</p>
<p>And Ingleside came to my side, strong and game,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once he appear&rsquo;d to outstrip me,<br>
  But I felt the steel gore, and I shot to the fore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only Cadger seem&rsquo;d likely to whip me.</p>
<p>In the van of the battle I heard the logs rattle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke never seem&rsquo;d to diminish,<br>
  And thrice I drew near him, and thrice he drew clear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the weight served him well at the finish.</p>
<p>Ha! Cadger goes down, see, he stands on his crown&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those rails take a power of clouting&mdash;<br>
  A long sliding blunder&mdash;he&rsquo;s up&mdash;well, I wonder<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If now it&rsquo;s all over but shouting.</p>
<p>All loosely he&rsquo;s striding, the amateur&rsquo;s riding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All loosely, some reverie locked in<br>
  Of a &ldquo;vision in smoke&rdquo;, or a &ldquo;wayfaring bloke&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His poetical rubbish concocting.</p>
<p>Now comes from afar the faint cry, &ldquo;Here they are,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The violet winning with ease,&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Fred goes up like a shot,&rdquo; &ldquo;Does he catch him or not?&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Level money, I&rsquo;ll take the cerise.</p>
<p>To his haunches I spring, and my muzzle I bring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To his flank, to his girth, to his shoulder;<br>
  Through the shouting and yelling I hear my name swelling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hearts of my backers grow bolder.</p>
<p>Neck and neck! head and head! staring eye! nostril spread!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girth and stifle laid close to the ground!<br>
  Stride for stride! stroke for stroke! through one hurdle we&rsquo;ve broke!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the splinters we&rsquo;ve lit with one bound.</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Banker for choice&rdquo; is the cry, and one voice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screams &ldquo;Six to four once upon Banker;&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Banker wins,&rdquo; &ldquo;Banker&rsquo;s beat,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cadger wins,&rdquo; &ldquo;A dead heat&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! there goes Fred&rsquo;s whalebone a flanker.</p>
<p>Springs the whip with a crack! nine stone ten on his back,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fit and light he can race like the devil;<br>
  I draw past him&mdash;&rsquo;tis vain; he draws past me again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs the whip! and again we are level.</p>
<p>Steel and cord do their worst, now my head struggles first!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That tug my last spurt has expended&mdash;<br>
  Nose to nose! lip to lip! from the sound of the whip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He strains to the utmost extended.</p>
<p>How they swim through the air, as we roll to the chair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand, faces, and railings flit past;<br>
  Now I spring * * *<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  from my lair with a snort and a stare,<br>

  In trials whence touts take their winner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rumours that circulate fast,<br>
  In strains from Prunella or Priam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Staying stayers, or goers that go,<br>
  You&rsquo;re much better posted than I am,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis little I care, less I know.</p>
<p>Alas! neither poet nor prophet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I, though a jingler of rhymes&mdash;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis a hobby of mine, and I&rsquo;m off it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times, and I&rsquo;m on it at times;<br>
  And whether I&rsquo;m off it or on it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your readers my counsels will shun,<br>
  Since I scarce know Van Tromp from Blue Bonnet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I might know Cigar from the Nun.</p>
<p>With &ldquo;visions&rdquo; you ought to be sated<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sicken&rsquo;d by this time, I swear<br>
  That mine are all myths self-created,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air visions that vanish in air;<br>
  If I had some loose coins I might chuck one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To settle this question and say,<br>
  &ldquo;Here goes! this is tails for the black one,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And heads for my fav&rsquo;rite the bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And must I rob Paul to pay Peter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or Peter defraud to pay Paul?<br>
  My rhymes, are they stale? if my metre<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is varied, one chime rings through all;<br>
  One chime&mdash;though I sing more or sing less,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have but one string to my lute,<br>
  And it might have been better if, stringless<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And songless, the same had been mute.</p>
<p>Yet not as a seer of visions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet as a dreamer of dreams,<br>
  I send you these partial decisions<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On hackney&rsquo;d, impoverish&rsquo;d themes;<br>
  But with song out of tune, sung to pass time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flung heedless to friends or to foes,<br>
  Where the false notes that ring for the last time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May blend with some real ones, who knows?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>The Race</b> </h3>
<p>On the hill they are crowding together,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the stand they are crushing for room,<br>
  Like midge-flies they swarm on the heather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gather like bees on the broom;<br>
  They flutter like moths round a candle&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stale similes, granted, what then?<br>
  I&rsquo;ve got a stale subject to handle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very stale stump of a pen.</p>
<p>Hark! the shuffle of feet that are many,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of voices the many-tongued clang&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Has he had a bad night?&rdquo; &ldquo;Has he any<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Friends left?&rdquo;&mdash;How I hate your turf slang;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis stale to begin with, not witty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But dull, and inclined to be coarse,<br>
  But bad men can&rsquo;t use (more&rsquo;s the pity)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good words when they slate a good horse.</p>
<p><i>Heu! heu! quantus equis</i> (that&rsquo;s Latin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For &ldquo;bellows to mend&rdquo; with the weeds),<br>
  They&rsquo;re off! lights and shades! silk and satin!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rainbow of riders and steeds!<br>
  And one shows in front, and another<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes up and is seen in his place,<br>
  <i>Sic transit</i> (more Latin)&mdash;Oh! bother,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s get to the end of the race.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>See, they come round the last turn careering,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already Tait&rsquo;s colours are struck,<br>
  And the green in the vanguard is steering,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the red&rsquo;s in the rear of the ruck!<br>
  Are the stripes in the shade doom&rsquo;d to lie long?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the blue stars on white skies wax dim?<br>
  Is it Tamworth or Smuggler? &rsquo;Tis Bylong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wins&mdash;either Bylong or Tim.</p>
<p>As the shell through the breach that is riven<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sapp&rsquo;d by the springing of mines,<br>
  As the bolt from the thunder-cloud driven,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That levels the larches and pines,<br>
  Through yon mass parti-colour&rsquo;d that dashes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal-turn&rsquo;d, clad in many-hued garb,<br>
  From rear to van, surges and flashes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The yellow and black of The Barb.</p>
<p>Past The Fly, falling back on the right, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gull, giving way on the left,<br>
  Past Tamworth, who feels the whip smite, and<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose sides by the rowels are cleft;<br>
  Where Tim and the chestnut together<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still bear of the battle the brunt,<br>
  As if eight stone twelve were a feather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He comes with a rush to the front.</p>
<p>Tim Whiffler may yet prove a Tartar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Bylong&rsquo;s the horse that can stay,<br>
  But Kean is in trouble&mdash;and Carter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is hard on the satin-skinn&rsquo;d bay;<br>
  And The Barb comes away unextended,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard held, like a second Eclipse,<br>
  While behind the hoof-thunder is blended<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the whistling and crackling of whips.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Epilogue</b> </h3>
<p>He wins; yes, he wins upon paper,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn&rsquo;t yet won upon turf,<br>
  And these rhymes are but moonshine and vapour,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air-bubbles and spume from the surf.<br>
  So be it, at least they are given<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Free, gratis, for just what they&rsquo;re worth,<br>
  And (whatever there may be in heaven)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s little worth much upon earth.</p>
<p>When, with satellites round them, the centre,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all eyes, hard press&rsquo;d by the crowd,<br>
  The pair, horse and rider, re-enter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gate, &rsquo;mid a shout long and loud,<br>
  You may feel, as you might feel, just landed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Full length on the grass from the clip<br>
  Of a vicious cross-counter, right-handed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or upper-cut whizzing from hip.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s not so bad if you&rsquo;re pick&rsquo;d up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discreetly, and carefully nursed;<br>
  Loose teeth by the sponge are soon lick&rsquo;d up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And next time you <i>may</i> get home first.<br>
  Still I&rsquo;m not sure you&rsquo;d like it exactly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Such tastes as a rule are acquired),<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll find in a nutshell this fact lie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bruised optics are not much admired.</p>
<p>Do I bore you with vulgar allusions?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgive me, I speak as I feel,<br>
  I&rsquo;ve ponder&rsquo;d and made my conclusions&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the mill grinds the corn to the meal;<br>
  So man striving boldly but blindly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ground piecemeal in Destiny&rsquo;s mill,<br>
  At his best, taking punishment kindly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is only a chopping-block still.</p>
<p>Are we wise? Our abstruse calculations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are based on experience long;<br>
  Are we sanguine? Our high expectations<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are founded on hope that is strong;<br>
  Thus we build an air-castle that crumbles<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And drifts till no traces remain,<br>
  And the fool builds again while he grumbles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the wise one laughs, building again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came they to pass, these rash blunders,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These false steps so hard to defend?&rdquo;<br>
  Our friend puts the question and wonders,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We laugh and reply, &ldquo;Ah! my friend,<br>
  Could you trace the first stride falsely taken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance misjudged, where or how,<br>
  When you pick&rsquo;d yourself up, stunn&rsquo;d and shaken,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the fence &rsquo;twixt the turf and the plough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the jar of the panel rebounding!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the crash of the splintering wood!<br>
  In the ears to the earth shock resounding!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the eyes flashing fire and blood!<br>
  In the quarters above you revolving!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sods underneath heaving high!<br>
  There was little to aid you in solving<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such questions&mdash;the how or the why.</p>
<p>And destiny, steadfast in trifles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is steadfast for better or worse<br>
  In great things, it crushes and stifles,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And swallows the hopes that we nurse.<br>
  Men wiser than we are may wonder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the future they cling to so fast,<br>
  To the roll of that destiny&rsquo;s thunder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goes down with the wrecks of the past.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>The past! the dead past! that has swallow&rsquo;d<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the honey of life and the milk,<br>
  Brighter dreams than mere pastimes we&rsquo;ve follow&rsquo;d,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better things than our scarlet or silk;<br>
  Aye, and worse things&mdash;that past is it really<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dead to us who again and again<br>
  Feel sharply, hear plainly, see clearly,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past days with their joy and their pain?</p>
<p>Like corpses embalm&rsquo;d and unburied<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They lie, and in spite of our will,<br>
  Our souls on the wings of thought carried,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revisit their sepulchres still;<br>
  Down the channels of mystery gliding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They conjure strange tales, rarely read,<br>
  Of the priests of dead Pharaohs presiding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At mystical feasts of the dead.</p>
<p>Weird pictures arise, quaint devices,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rude emblems, baked funeral meats,<br>
  Strong incense, rare wines, and rich spices,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ashes, the shrouds, and the sheets;<br>
  Does our thraldom fall short of completeness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the magic of a charnel-house charm,<br>
  And the flavour of a poisonous sweetness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the odour of a poisonous balm?</p>
<p>And the links of the past&mdash;but, no matter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For I&rsquo;m getting beyond you, I guess,<br>
  And you&rsquo;ll call me &ldquo;as mad as a hatter&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my thoughts I too freely express;<br>
  I subjoin a quotation, pray learn it,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with the aid of your lexicon tell us<br>
  The meaning thereof&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Res discernit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sapiens, quas confundit asellus</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already green hillocks are swelling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And combing white locks on the bar,<br>
  Where a dull, droning murmur is telling<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of winds that have gather&rsquo;d afar;<br>
  Thus we know not the day, nor the morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor yet what the night may bring forth,<br>
  Nor the storm, nor the sleep, nor the sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor the strife, nor the rest, nor the wrath.</p>
<p>Yet the skies are still tranquil and starlit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun &rsquo;twixt the wave and the west<br>
  Dies in purple, and crimson, and scarlet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gold; let us hope for the best,<br>
  Since again from the earth his effulgence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The darkness and damp-dews shall wipe.<br>
  Kind reader, extend your indulgence<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To this the last lay of &ldquo;The Pipe&rdquo;.</p>

<p align="center" class="note">or, the<br>
Lay of the Last Charger</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the Pyrrhic dance as yet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?<br>
  Of two such lessons, why forget<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nobler and the manlier one?&rdquo; &mdash;&nbsp;<i>Byron</i>.</p>
<p>One&nbsp;line of swart profiles and bearded lips dressing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One ridge of bright helmets, one crest of fair plumes,<br>
  One streak of blue sword-blades all bared for the fleshing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One row of red nostrils that scent battle-fumes.</p>
<p>Forward! the trumpets were sounding the charge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roll of the kettledrum rapidly ran,<br>
  That music, like wild-fire spreading at large,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madden&rsquo;d the war-horse as well as the man.</p>
<p>Forward! still forward! we thunder&rsquo;d along,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Steadily yet, for our strength we were nursing;<br>
  Tall Ewart, our sergeant, was humming a song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lance-corporal Black Will was blaspheming and cursing.</p>
<p>Open&rsquo;d their volley of guns on our right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Puffs of grey smoke, veiling gleams of red flame,<br>
  Curling to leeward, were seen on the height,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the batteries were posted, as onward we came.</p>
<p>Spreading before us their cavalry lay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Squadron on squadron, troop upon troop;<br>
  We were so few, and so many were they&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eagles wait calmly the sparrow-hawk&rsquo;s stoop.</p>
<p>Forward! still forward! steed answering steed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cheerily neigh&rsquo;d, while the foam flakes were toss&rsquo;t<br>
  From bridle to bridle&mdash;the top of our speed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was gain&rsquo;d, but the pride of our order was lost.</p>
<p>One was there leading by nearly a rood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we were racing he kept to the fore,<br>
  Still as a rock in his stirrups he stood,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High in the sunlight his sabre he bore.</p>
<p>Suddenly tottering, backwards he crash&rsquo;t,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loudly his helm right in front of us rung;<br>
  Iron hoofs thunder&rsquo;d, and naked steel flash&rsquo;t<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over him&mdash;youngest, where many were young.</p>
<p>Now we were close to them, every horse striding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madly;&mdash;St. Luce pass&rsquo;t with never a groan;&mdash;<br>
  Sadly my master look&rsquo;t round&mdash;he was riding<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the boy&rsquo;s right, with a line of his own.</p>
<p>Thrusting his hand in his breast or breast-pocket,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While from his wrist the sword swung by a chain,<br>
  Swiftly he drew out some trinket or locket,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiss&rsquo;t it (I think) and replaced it again.</p>
<p>Burst, while his fingers reclosed on the haft,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jarring concussion and earth shaking din,<br>
  Horse &rsquo;counter&rsquo;d horse, and I reel&rsquo;d, but he laugh&rsquo;t,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down went his man, cloven clean to the chin!</p>
<p>Wedged in the midst of that struggling mass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the first shock, where each his foe singled,<br>
  Little was seen, save a dazzle, like glass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the sun, with grey smoke and black dust  intermingled.</p>
<p>Here and there redden&rsquo;d a pistol shot, flashing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the red sparkle of steel upon steel!<br>
  Redder the spark seem&rsquo;d, and louder the clashing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck from the helm by the iron-shod heel!</p>
<p>Over fallen riders, like wither&rsquo;d leaves strewing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uplands in autumn, we sunder&rsquo;d their ranks;<br>
  Steeds rearing and plunging, men hacking and hewing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fierce grinding of sword-blades, sharp goading of  flanks.</p>
<p>Short was the crisis of conflict soon over,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being too good (I suppose) to last long;<br>
  Through them we cut, as the scythe cuts the clover,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Batter&rsquo;d and stain&rsquo;d we emerged from their throng.</p>
<p>Some of our saddles were emptied, of course;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaven (or elsewhere) Black Will had been carried!<br>
  Ned Sullivan mounted Will&rsquo;s riderless horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mare being hurt, while ten seconds we tarried.</p>
<p>And then we re-formed, and went at them once more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere they had rightly closed up the old track,<br>
  We broke through the lane we had open&rsquo;d before,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as we went forward e&rsquo;en so we came back.</p>
<p>Our numbers were few, and our loss far from small,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could fight, and, besides, they were twenty to  one;<br>
  We were clear of them all when we heard the recall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thus we returned, but my tale is not done.</p>
<p>For the hand of my rider felt strange on my bit,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He breathed once or twice like one partially choked,<br>
  And sway&rsquo;d in his seat, then I knew he was hit;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He must have bled fast, for my withers were soak&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And scarcely an inch of my housing was dry;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I slacken&rsquo;d my speed, yet I never quite stop&rsquo;t,<br>
  Ere he patted my neck, said, &ldquo;Old fellow, good-bye!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dropp&rsquo;d off me gently, and lay where he drop&rsquo;t!</p>
<p>Ah, me! after all, they may call us dumb creatures&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried hard to neigh, but the sobs took my breath,<br>
  Yet I guess&rsquo;t gazing down at those still, quiet features,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was never more happy in life than in death.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * *</b></p>
<p>Two years back, at Aldershot,  Elrington mentioned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name to our colonel one field-day. He said,<br>
  &ldquo;&lsquo;Count&rsquo;, &lsquo;Steeltrap&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Challenger&rsquo; ought to be pension&rsquo;d;&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Count&rdquo; died the same week, and now &ldquo;Steeltrap&rdquo; is  dead.</p>
<p>That morning our colonel was riding &ldquo;Theresa&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The filly by &ldquo;Teddington&rdquo; out of &ldquo;Mistake&rdquo;;<br>
  His girls, pretty Alice and fair-haired Louisa,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there on the ponies he purchased from Blake.</p>
<p>I remember he pointed me out to his daughters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said he, &ldquo;In this troop I may fairly take pride,<br>
  But I&rsquo;ve none left like him in my officers&rsquo; quarters,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose life-blood the mane of old &lsquo;Challenger&rsquo; dyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where are they? the war-steeds who shared in our glory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &ldquo;Lanercost&rdquo; colt, and the &ldquo;Acrobat&rdquo; mare,<br>
  And the Irish division, &ldquo;Kate Kearney&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rory&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rushing &ldquo;Roscommon&rdquo;, and eager &ldquo;Kildare,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And &ldquo;Freeny&rdquo;, a favourite once with my master,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;Warlock&rdquo;, a sluggard, but honest and true,<br>
  And &ldquo;Tancred&rdquo;, as honest as &ldquo;Warlock&rdquo;, but faster,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &ldquo;Blacklock&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Birdlime&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Molly Carew?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>All vanish&rsquo;t, what wonder! twelve summers have pass&rsquo;t<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then, and my comrade lies buried this day,&mdash;<br>
  Old &ldquo;Steeltrap&rdquo;, the kicker,&mdash;and now I&rsquo;m the last<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the chargers who shared in that glorious fray.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>Come, &ldquo;Harlequin&rdquo;, keep your nose out of my manger,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get your allowance, my boy, and no more;<br>
  Snort! &ldquo;Silvertail&rdquo;, snort! when you&rsquo;ve seen as much danger<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have, you won&rsquo;t mind the rats in the straw.</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>Our gallant old colonel came limping and halting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day before yesterday, into my stall;<br>
  Oh! light to the saddle I&rsquo;ve once seen him vaulting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In full marching order, steel broadsword and all.</p>
<p>And now his left leg than his right is made shorter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three inches, he stoops, and his chest is unsound;<br>
  He spoke to me gently, and patted my quarter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I laid my ears back, and look&rsquo;t playfully round.</p>
<p>For that word kindly meant, that caress kindly given,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thank&rsquo;t him, though dumb, but my cheerfulness fled;<br>
  More sadness I drew from the face of the living<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than years back I did from the face of the dead.</p>
<p>For the dead face, upturn&rsquo;d, tranquil, joyous, and fearless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look&rsquo;t straight from green sod to blue fathomless sky<br>
  With a smile; but the living face, gloomy and tearless,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And haggard and harass&rsquo;d, look&rsquo;t down with a sigh.</p>
<p>Did he think on the first time he kiss&rsquo;t Lady Mary?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning he wing&rsquo;d Horace Greville the beau?<br>
  On the winner he steer&rsquo;d in the grand military?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the charge that he headed twelve long years ago?</p>
<p>Did he think on each fresh year, of fresh grief the herald?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On lids that are sunken, and locks that are grey?<br>
  On Alice, who  bolted with Brian Fitzgerald?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Rupert, his first-born, dishonour&rsquo;d by &ldquo;play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Louey, his darling, who sleeps &rsquo;neath the cypress,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That shades her and one whose last breath gave her  life?&mdash;<br>
  I saw those strong fingers hard over each eye press&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! the dead rest in peace when the quick toil in  strife!</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ever your shallow philosophy guess&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>You are proud of your power, and vain of your courage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your blood, Anglo-Saxon, or Norman, or Celt;<br>
  Though your gifts you extol, and our gifts you disparage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your perils, your pleasures, your sorrows we&rsquo;ve felt.</p>
<p>We, too, sprung from mares of the prophet of Mecca,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And nursed on the pride that was born with the milk,<br>
  And filtered through &ldquo;Crucifix&rdquo;, &ldquo;Beeswing&rdquo;, &ldquo;Rebecca&rdquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We love sheen of scarlet and shimmer of silk.</p>
<p>We, too, sprung from loins of the Ishmaelite stallions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We glory in daring that dies or prevails;<br>
  From counter of squadrons, and crash of battalions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To rending of blackthorns, and rattle of rails.</p>
<p>In all strife where courage is tested, and power,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the meet on the hill-side, the horn-blast, the  find,<br>
  The burst, the long gallop that seems to devour<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The champaign, all obstacles flinging behind,</p>
<p>To the cheer and the clarion, the war-music blended<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With war-cry, the furious dash at the foe,<br>
  The terrible shock, the recoil, and the splendid<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare sword, flashing blue, rising red from the blow.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve borne <i>one</i> through  perils where many have seen us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No tyrant, a kind friend, a patient instructor,<br>
  And I&rsquo;ve felt some strange element flashing between us,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till the saddle seem&rsquo;d turn&rsquo;d to a lightning conductor.</p>
<p>Did he see? could he feel through the faintness, the numbness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While linger&rsquo;d the spirit half-loosed from the clay,<br>
  Dumb eyes seeking his in their piteous dumbness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dumb quivering nostrils, too stricken to neigh?</p>
<p>And what then? the colours reversed, the drums muffled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black nodding plumes, the dead march and the pall,<br>
  The stern faces, soldier-like, silent, unruffled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The slow sacred music that floats over all!</p>
<p>Cross carbine and boar-spear, hang bugle and banner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spur, sabre, and snaffle, and helm&mdash;Is it well?<br>
  Vain &rsquo;scutcheon, false trophies of Mars and Diana,&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the dead laurel sprout with the live <i>immortelle?</i></p>
<p>It may be,&mdash;we follow, and though we inherit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strength for a season, our pride for a span,<br>
  Say! vanity are they? vexation of spirit?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so, since they serve for a time horse and man.</p>
<p>They serve for a time, and they make life worth living,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of life&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;&rsquo;tis vain to despond;<br>
  Oh, man! <i>we</i> at least, <i>we</i> enjoy, with thanksgiving,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God&rsquo;s gifts on this earth, though we look not beyond.</p>
<p><i>You</i>&nbsp;sin,  and&nbsp;<i>you</i>&nbsp;suffer, and we, too, find sorrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance through&nbsp;<i>your</i>&nbsp;sin&mdash;yet it soon  will be o&rsquo;er;<br>
  We labour to-day, and we slumber to-morrow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong horse and bold rider!&mdash;and&nbsp;<i>who knoweth  more</i>?</p>
<p align="center"><b>* * * * * *  * * *</b></p>
<p>In our barrack-square shouted drill-sergeant McCluskie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roll of the kettledrum rapidly ran,<br>
  The colonel wheel&rsquo;d short, speaking once, dry and husky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Would to God I had died with your master, old man!&rdquo;</p>
