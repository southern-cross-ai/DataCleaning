  <p>How wonderful are dreams! Yet, are they but<br>
    (As some suppose) the thin disjoining shades<br>
    Of thoughts or feelings long foregone or late,<br>
    As recomposed and put in ghostly act,<br>
    And strange procession, wildly mixed, and yet<br>
    So life-like, though thus composite and wild,<br>
    By mimic Fancy; when, alone awake,<br>
    And thence unhindered in her mystic craft,<br>
    She tracks again the drifts of wearied Thought,<br>
    Itself sunk sleepward! Wonderful no less<br>
    Are they though this be true; and wondrous more<br>
    Is she who in the dark, and stript of sense,<br>
    Can claim such sovereignty &mdash; the Queen of Art!<br>
    For what a cunning painter is she then,<br>
    Who hurriedly embodying from the waste<br>
    Of things memorial littering life&rsquo;s dim floor,<br>
    The forms and features, manifold and quaint,<br>
    That crowd the timeless vistas of a Dream,<br>
    Fails never in a stroke; and breathes as well<br>
    (With powers that laugh at Sculpture, &mdash; or make good<br>
    The fabled influence of Pygmalion&rsquo;s weird<br>
    Devotion to his own creative craft)<br>
    A spirit of motion into all her work &mdash;<br>
    The test of Deity; &mdash; inspiring too<br>
    Her phantom creatures with more eloquent tones<br>
    Than ever broke in subtle light-like wares<br>
    Upon the province of a waking ear.</p>
  <p>But are they more? True glimpses oft, though vague,<br>
    Derived from some unnavigable sea<br>
    Of mystic being, on whose lonely shore<br>
    The normal terminates; and where the pent,<br>
    Impatient Soul, from its sleep-shrouded crib,<br>
    Is sometimes wont to slip, and roam at large,<br>
    Like Crusoe, staring forth; or musing, stand<br>
    As did the intelligence of Newton once<br>
    On the bare beach of time, while the great deep<br>
    Of Truth, by Science yet uncharted, loomed<br>
    In shoreless width, &mdash; illimitably out,<br>
    Under the incommunicable sky?</p>
  <p>No answer cometh, and as vain is all<br>
    Conjecture: they are dreams! but wonderful,<br>
    However we may rank them in our lore.<br>
    And worthy of some fond record are those states<br>
    Of our interior being, though aberrant,<br>
    That with so capable a wand can bring<br>
    Back to the faded heart, the rosy flush<br>
    And sweetness of a long fled love, or touch<br>
    The eyes of an old enmity with tears<br>
    Of a yet older friendship; or restore<br>
    A world-lost mate, or reunite in joy<br>
    The living and the dead! And this can Dreams:<br>
    With more as wonderful;&mdash; can, when so wills<br>
    Their wands weird wielder, whatsoe&rsquo;er it be,<br>
    Lift up the fallen &mdash; fallen however low!<br>
    Rejuvenate the worn, enrich the poor,<br>
    The past imparadise, and enchant the present;<br>
    Build in the future higher than the hope<br>
    Of Power, when boldest, ever dared to soar;<br>
    Annul, as with the sanction of the Infinite,<br>
    The prison bars of place, the dens of time, &mdash;<br>
    Giving the rigid and cold clanking chain<br>
    Which Force, that grey iniquity, hath clenched<br>
    About its captive, to relent, &mdash; yea, stretch<br>
    Forth into Fairy Land; or melt like wax<br>
    In that fierce life whose spirit lightens wide<br>
    Round Freedom, seated on his mountain throne!<br>
    Or witching Memory, where she darkling lies,<br>
    Can so accomplish her that she can make<br>
    All brute bulk ocular &mdash; the great Earth itself<br>
    Diaphanous, like a mighty globe of glass<br>
    Hung in the dim Inane, and thence reveal<br>
    Some yearned-for hearth at the antipodes,<br>
    With all its loves; or spread. at once her wings<br>
    O&rsquo;er all the eras of a wandering life,<br>
    As from the orient to the ends of heaven<br>
    The silvery fans of light, evolving, show<br>
    All things beneath them in one world-wide act<br>
    Instant and universal. &mdash; Wonderful!</p>
  <p>But not thus always are our dreams benign:<br>
    Oft are they miscreations &mdash; gloomier worlds,<br>
    Crowded tempestuously with Wrongs and Fears,<br>
    More ghastly than the Actual ever knew;<br>
    And rent with racking noises &mdash; such as might,<br>
    If audible ever to a soul awake,<br>
    Go thundering only through the wastes of Hell.</p>
  <p>So wonderful are Dreams: and I have known<br>
    Many most wild and strange. And once, long since,<br>
    As in the death-like mystery of Sleep<br>
    My body lay impalled, my soul arose<br>
    And journeyed outward in a dream of wonder,<br>
    In the mid hour of a dark night, methought<br>
    I roamed the margin of a waveless lake,<br>
    That, in the knotted forehead of the land<br>
    Deep sunken, like a huge Cyclopean eye,<br>
    Lidless and void of speculation, stared<br>
    Glassily up, &mdash; forever sleepless, &mdash; up<br>
    At the wide vault of heaven; and that I had<br>
    Also a vague and mystic consciousness<br>
    That over against me, on the farther shore,<br>
    Which yet I might not see, there stood a Tower<br>
    Such as we read of in some old romance.</p>
  <p>The darkness darkened, until overhead<br>
    Solidly black the starless heaven domed,<br>
    And earth was one wide blot; &mdash; when, as I looked,<br>
    A light swung blazing from the tower (as yet<br>
    Prophesied only in imagination,)<br>
    And brought at once its rounded structure forth<br>
    Out of the mighty gloom, wherein, till then<br>
    So shut, it seemed as one in substance with it.<br>
    And when this light had steadied, hanging there<br>
    Suspended as by magic, I might see<br>
    In the wide lake, whose whole disc new first shown,<br>
    Glimmered enormous, &mdash; the far falling stream<br>
    Of its wild radiance, columnar and vast,<br>
    Reach quivering &mdash; down, like a great shaft of fire,<br>
    Through the lit fluid, that, so lightened, seemed<br>
    A vague abysm infinitely deep.</p>
  <p>Long at that wild light was I gazing held<br>
    In speechless wonder &mdash; till I thence could feel<br>
    A strange and thrillingly attractive power<br>
    In gradual operation; and ere long<br>
    My bodily weight seemed witched away, and up<br>
    I mounted, poised within the passive air;<br>
    Then glode ascendingly sheer o&rsquo;er the lake,<br>
    Which far below, as tow&rsquo;rds the wondrous light<br>
    The attraction drew me, I beheld illumined<br>
    Even to its sullen depths with shifting beams,<br>
    That tangled tower-ward into one broad path<br>
    Of multifarious splendour &mdash;&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;red blaze<br>
    Yet various, interwrithing, wild and quick,<br>
    As every molecule of the watery mass<br>
    Had an organic life, and played a part<br>
    Restlessly proper to its wayward self,<br>
    Though tending all into one glow of bright<br>
    Disunion in bright union &mdash;&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;red blaze</p>
  <p>Still poised within the soft air, on I slid:<br>
    Nor knew I why &mdash; but my amaze wore off<br>
    As thus I glode over the lake, and still<br>
    Approached the tower, and that so wondrous light!<br>
    And soon, instead, a many-branching warmth<br>
    Like the sweet inklings of new love,<br>
    Began to tingle in my blood, and so divine<br>
    The nearness of some yet unseen Content,<br>
    Still nearing, or some yet inaudible Joy,<br>
    So great, so reconciling, that it seemed<br>
    It was a golden destiny whose spell<br>
    Had lifted me aloft, and tower-ward on<br>
    Thus richly attracted:&mdash; and with this so sweet<br>
Conception &mdash; lo, how beautiful a change!</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="PartII"></a>Part II</h2>
  <p>Within a circular balcony, whose roof<br>
    Was fluted silver, ledging at the eaves<br>
    Outward, and resting upon shafts of jet,<br>
    Whose polished pencils, in a curving row<br>
    Descending to an ivory balustrade<br>
    Glistened in contrast with a covert gleam;<br>
    And which, high up the tower, emporched a huge<br>
    And brazen door &mdash; behold a Lady, all<br>
    Of light immaculate! Yea, face and form<br>
    All of a Hesper radiancy composed,<br>
    And lovelier than lustrous, stood alone,<br>
    Yet, as it seemed, expectant; for as still<br>
    She witched me tow&rsquo;rds her, she kept beckoning still<br>
    With tiny hand more splendid than a star:<br>
    Beckoning and smiling &mdash; not as mortals smile,<br>
    With visible throes, to the more face confined,<br>
    But with her whole bright influence all at once<br>
    In gracious act &mdash; as the immortals smile,<br>
    God-happy; or as smiles the morning, when<br>
    Its subtle lips in rosy glory part<br>
    And redden lengthwise, under and above<br>
    Full many a pearly cloud, and breathe the while<br>
    A golden prevalence of power abroad,<br>
    That takes them all into his own delight &mdash;<br>
    Transfiguring all! and with a voice intense<br>
    And intimately tender as the first<br>
    Fine feeling of a love-born bliss &mdash; and oh!<br>
    More silvery in its sweetness to the soul&rsquo;s<br>
    Oracular ear, than seemeth to the eye<br>
    The wild white radiance of the maiden moon,<br>
    When from some cape&rsquo;s dark beak her rising mass<br>
    Looks o&rsquo;er the ocean &mdash; even with such a voice,<br>
    So keen, so silvery, did she ask me then,<br>
  &ldquo;Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With thrilling ears and heart, I heard &mdash; but felt<br>
    Pass from me forth a cry of sudden fear,<br>
    As swooning through the wildness of my joy,<br>
    Methought I drifted: &mdash; whither? All was now<br>
    One wide cold blank &mdash; the Lady and the Tower &mdash;<br>
    The gleaming lake, with all around it &mdash; one<br>
    Wide dreary blank, &mdash; the drearier for that still<br>
    A dizzy, clinging, ghostly consciousness<br>
    Kept flickering from mine inmost pulse of life,<br>
    Like a fair meteor in some dismal marsh:<br>
    How long I dreamt not &mdash; but the thrilling warmth<br>
    That like the new birth of a passionate bliss,<br>
    Erewhile had searched me to the quick, again<br>
    Shuddered within me, &mdash; more and more, &mdash; until<br>
    Mine eyes had opened under&nbsp;<i>two</i>&nbsp;that made<br>
    All else like darkness; and upon my cheek<br>
    A breath that seemed the final spirit of health<br>
    And floral sweetness, harbingered once more<br>
    The fond enquiry of that silver voice<br>
    Which once to have heard was never to forget &mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And when she thus in her so wondrous way<br>
    Had spoken, there came, warbled as it seemed<br>
    In mystical respondence to her voice,<br>
    Still music, such as Eolus gives forth,<br>
    But purer, deeper; &mdash; warbled as from some<br>
    Unsearchable recess of soul supreme &mdash;<br>
    Some depth of the Eternal! echoing thence<br>
    Through the sweet meanings of its spirit speech,<br>
    The fond enquiry that awoke me now:<br>
  &ldquo;Where hast thou stayed so long? Oh, tell me where!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>I answered not, but followed in mute love<br>
    The beamy glances of her eyes with mine,<br>
    As in that balcony which up that tower<br>
    Emporched the brazen door, methought I now<br>
    Close at her side reclined upon a couch<br>
    Of purple, blazoned all with stars of gold,<br>
    Tremblingly rayed with spiculated gems,<br>
    And argent moons, &mdash; and bearing on cushions, rough<br>
    (Save where they met the flexure of the arm)<br>
    With sheaves of flowers in glowing tissue wrought.<br>
    Thus set we, looking forth; nor did I marvel,<br>
    As her&rsquo;s now led my vision, to remark<br>
    How the broad lake, with its green shelving shores,<br>
    Swarming with honey-yielding flowers, or hung<br>
    With vines in masses, bunched with fruit; and thence<br>
    The prospect all &mdash; hills, skies, and winding vales,<br>
    And bloomy forests of unspeakable beauty,<br>
    Were basking in the blessedness of a day<br>
    So goldenly serene, that never yet<br>
    The perfect power of life-essential light<br>
    Might so enrobe, since Paradise was lost,<br>
    The common world inhabited by man.</p>
  <p>I saw all this surpassing beauty &mdash; but,<br>
    I saw it thus through her superior life,<br>
    As orbing mine in love &mdash; yea, saw it through<br>
    Her mystic moon-like sphere of being, that seemed<br>
    (Transpicuously) the inexhaustible source<br>
    Of holiest motives, and truth-breathing thoughts &mdash;<br>
    Breathing abroad like odours from a flower;<br>
    And orient idealities; and more<br>
    Of rosy passion, and affectionate joy,<br>
    And earnest tenderness, than many souls<br>
    Of earth&rsquo;s most fervent and ecstatic daughters<br>
    United might possess; all interflowing<br>
    Through the fine issues of a love at once<br>
    Wilful and nice, but sanctioned none the less<br>
    By its so brilliant purity. Nor might<br>
    The glassy lake below more quickly give<br>
    Nimble impressions of the coming wind&rsquo;s<br>
    Invisible footsteps, dimpling swift along,<br>
    Than instant tokens of communion sweet<br>
    With outward beauty&rsquo;s subtle spirit, passed<br>
    Forth from her eyes, and thence in lambent waves<br>
    Suffused and lightened o&rsquo;er the splendid whole<br>
    Of her bright visage, or about her head<br>
    In spheres ran raying like a glory of bliss!</p>
  <p>But as upon the wonder of her beauty<br>
    My soul new feasted, even till it seemed<br>
    Instinct with kindred lustre, &mdash; lo, her eyes<br>
    Suddenly saddened; then abstractedly<br>
    Outfixing them as on some far wild thought<br>
    That darkened up like a portentous cloud,<br>
    Over the morning of our peace, she flung<br>
    Her silver voice into a mystic song<br>
    Of many measures, which as forth they went,<br>
    Slid all into a sweet abundant flood<br>
    Of metric melody! And with this, as still<br>
    She poured it out, invisible singers mixed<br>
    A choral burden that prolonged the strain&rsquo;s<br>
    Rich concords, till the echoes of the hills<br>
    Came challengingly forth, and backward then<br>
    Subsiding like a refluent wave, afar,<br>
    Blent all into&nbsp;<i>one</i>&nbsp;mystery of sound &mdash;<br>
  <i>One</i>&nbsp;manifold cadence &mdash; dying down. The Song<br>
    (Which strangely seemed through all its mystic drift<br>
    Addressed to the so stubborn fact, that I<br>
    Was sleeping, and its utterer but a Dream)<br>
    Is traced upon the tablet of my soul<br>
    In shining lines that intonate themselves &mdash;<br>
    Not sounding to the ear, but to the thought,<br>
    Out of the vague east of the wonderful!<br>
    And might when hardened into mortal speech,<br>
    And narrowed from its wide and various sweep<br>
    Into such flows as make our waking rhymes<br>
    Most wildly musical, be written thus:&mdash;<br>
  </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSong"></a>The Song</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wide apart &mdash; wide apart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In old Time&rsquo;s dim heart<br>
    One terrible fiend doth his stern watch keep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the mystery<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lovely and  deep,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could we but charm him,<br>

    Through the darkness so dreadful &mdash; so deathly and deep<br>

    With all that soul, freed from the body&rsquo;s strait scheme,<br>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to sleep were to  die,<br>

  <p>She ceased: and a deep tingling silence fell<br>
    Instantly round, &mdash; silence complete, and yet<br>
    Instinct as with a breathing sweetness, left<br>
    By the rare spirit of her voice foregone:<br>
    Even as the fragrance of a flower were felt<br>
    Pervading the mute air through which erewhile,<br>
    It had been borne by the delighted hand<br>
    Of some sweet-thoughted maiden. Turning then<br>
    Her bright face tow&rsquo;rds me, as I stood entranced,<br>
    Yet with keen wonder stung, she said, &ldquo;I love thee!<br>
    As first love loveth &mdash; utterly! But ah!<br>
    This Love itself &mdash; this purple-wing&egrave;d Love &mdash;<br>
    This spirit-enriching Spirit of delight<br>
    Is but a honey-bee of Paradise,<br>
    That only in the morning glory dares<br>
    To range abroad &mdash; and when a vagrant most<br>
    Adventure out into the common world<br>
    Of man and woman; &mdash; thither lured by sight<br>
    Of some sweet human soul that blooms apart,<br>
    Untainted by a rank soil&rsquo;s weedy growths: &mdash;<br>
    Lured thither thus &mdash; yet being even then,<br>
    But wilful wandering away &mdash; away<br>
    From its pure birth-place (innocent only there!)<br>
    And whereunto it must again return,<br>
    Or forfeit else its natal passport, &mdash;&nbsp;<i>ere</i><br>
    The dread night cometh. Yet of how great worth<br>
    Is all foregone affection? In the spring<br>
    Of even the lowliest love, how many rich<br>
    And gracious things that could not else have been,<br>
    Grow up like flowers, and breathe a perfume forth<br>
    That never leaves again the quickened sense<br>
    It once hath hit, as with a fairy&rsquo;s wand,<br>
    However fanciful may seem at last<br>
    The charm through which it came.&rdquo; And having said<br>
    These mystic sentences, so wild and sweet,<br>
    And memorably mournful, &mdash; lo, her eyes<br>
    Ran o&rsquo;er with lustres as they opened up<br>
    Under mine own now melancholy gaze.</p>
  <p>And thus we stood, turned one unto the other,<br>
    Till Love again grew glad even from the rich<br>
    And wine-like luxury and voluptuous worth<br>
    Of its own tear-showers, shed as from the heart!<br>
    Forth then once more we looked &mdash; silently happy:<br>
    Alas! not long: for with a short low gasp<br>
    Of sudden fear, she started; nor might I<br>
    Stand unalarmed. For hark! within the Tower,<br>
    A sound of strenuous steps approaching fast,<br>
    Rang upward, as it seemed, from the hard slabs<br>
    Of a steep-winding stair; and soon the huge<br>
    And brazen portal that behind us shut,<br>
    Burst open! with a clang of loosened bolts &mdash;<br>
    A clang like thunder, that went rattling out<br>
    Against the echoes of the distant hills.</p>
  <p>With deafened ears and looks aghast, I turned<br>
    Tow&rsquo;rds the harsh noise &mdash; there to behold, between<br>
    The mighty jambs in the Tower-wall from which<br>
    The door swung inward, a tremendous Form!<br>
    A horrid gloomy Form! that shapeless seemed,<br>
    And yet, in its so monstrous bulk, to Man<br>
    A hideous likeness bare! Still more and more<br>
    Deform it grew, as forth it swelled, and then<br>
    Its outlines, shadowing forward, so were lost<br>
    On all sides in a grizzly haze, that hung<br>
    Vaguely about them, &mdash; even as dull grey clouds<br>
    Beskirt a coming Tempest&rsquo;s denser mass,<br>
    That thickens still internally, and shows<br>
    The murkiest in the midst &mdash; yea, murkiest there<br>
    Where big with fate, and hid in solid gloom,<br>
    The yet-still spirit of the thunder broods,<br>
    And menaces the world. So dread that Form!</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, beholding it, the Lady of light<br>
    Had rushed to my extended arms, and hid<br>
    Her beamy face, fright-harrowed, in my bosom!<br>
    And thus we stood, made one in fear; while still<br>
    That terrible Vision out upon us glared<br>
    With horny eyeballs &mdash; all the more horrid<br>
    For that no evidence of conscious will,<br>
    Or touch of passion, vitalised their fixed<br>
    Eumenid&egrave;an, stone-cold stare, as tow&rsquo;rds<br>
    Some surely destined task they seemed to guide<br>
    Its shapeless bulk and pitiless strength alone.</p>
  <p>Then with a motion as of one dark stride<br>
    Shadowing forward, and outstretching straight<br>
    One vague-seen arm, from my reluctant grasp<br>
    It tore the radiant Lady, muttering&nbsp;<i>&ldquo;This<br>
      Is love forbidden!&rdquo;</i>&nbsp;in a voice whose tones<br>
    Were like low guttural thunders heard afar,<br>
    Outgrowling from the clouded gorges wild<br>
    Of neighboring mountains, when a sultry storm<br>
    Is pondering in its dark pavilions there,<br>
    And concentrating, like a hill-born host,<br>
    Ere it rush valeward; and, as suddenly,<br>
    Seized by the other, I was backward thrown<br>
    Within the Tower, and heard ere I could rise<br>
    From the cold platform, the huge brazen door<br>
    Drawn harshly grating to; its beamlike bar<br>
    Dropt, with a wall-quake, and the bolts all shot<br>
    Into their sockets with a shattering jar!</p>
  <p>I may not paint the horrible despair<br>
    That froze me now: (more horrible than aught<br>
    In actual destiny, whether bonds or death,<br>
    Could give the self-possession of my soul,<br>
    If wide awake.) I listened. All was still!<br>
    Within &mdash; without; &mdash; all silent, stirless, cold!<br>
    What was my doom? And where was she, my late<br>
    So luminous delight? Gone! Reft away<br>
    So strangely, terribly! and I myself,<br>
    For some all-unimaginable cause,<br>
    A dungeoned wretch! Time, every drip of which<br>
    Was as an age, kept trickling on, but there<br>
    Brought no release &mdash; no hope; &mdash; brought not a breath<br>
    That spake of fellowship, or even of life.<br>
    Out of myself &mdash; my lonely self! I stood<br>
    Utterly blank &mdash; utterly shrunken up,<br>
    In marble-cold astonishment of heart!<br>
    And when at length I cast a desperate look &mdash;<br>
    A look so desperate that the common gift<br>
    Of vision stung me like a deadly curse &mdash;<br>
    Up and around, pure pity of myself<br>
    So warmed and loosened from my brain the pent<br>
    And icy anguish, that its load at once<br>
    Came, like an alp-thaw, streaming through mine eyes;<br>
    Till resignation, that so balmy sweet<br>
    Meek flower of Grief which hath its root in tears,<br>
    Grew out of mine, &mdash; and leisure therewithal<br>
    To inspect my prison, whether weak or strong.</p>
  <p>It was a lofty coil, half round, and had,<br>
    Massively set, within the crossing wall<br>
    That seemed to cut the Tower&rsquo;s whole round in twain,<br>
    A second door &mdash; shut, and all clamped with brass,<br>
    And rough with rows of monstrous iron studs,<br>
    And which might haply have thence opened in<br>
    Athwart some stairway (as I guessed) that led<br>
    Down through the Tower; and by the side of this<br>
    A bat-wing&rsquo;d steed on scaly dragon claws &mdash;<br>
    A strange, mute, mystic, almost terrible thing,<br>
    Stood rigid, with a tripod near it placed.<br>
    Bare were the dull and ragged walls, but pierced<br>
    High out of reach by two small ports that looked<br>
    Eastward and westward. As I noted these,<br>
    Full on my sight a transient sunbeam fell<br>
    Slantingly through, and glowed on the damp floor<br>
    A moment, like a streak of burning blood,<br>
    Then vanished: wherefore in my heart I guessed<br>
    That o&rsquo;er the mountain tops the sun was then<br>
    Oceanward sinking mid the fiery clouds.</p>
  <p>By sure and palpable degrees the night<br>
    Came on, and the cell darkened. Yea, I saw<br>
    The steed and tripod &mdash; all its furniture &mdash;<br>
    Fade, melting gradually, more and more,<br>
    Into the darkness; even as a fish,<br>
    Through the dense medium of its element,<br>
    Retiring down, is in its outlines seen<br>
    More shadowy &mdash; till &rsquo;tis lost. Then all was black.<br>
    And to and fro I paced, hour after hour,<br>
    And heard my step, the only sound to me<br>
    In all the wide world, throb with a dull blow<br>
    Down through the hollow Tower that seemed to yawn<br>
    Immeasurably beneath me, &mdash; as it were<br>
    A monstrous well whose wide waste mouth was bridged<br>
    By that dull-quaking strip of floor alone<br>
    On which I darkling strode. Yet on I kept<br>
    Pacing, though horrified. Hour after hour<br>
    Passed as if clotting at the heart of Time &mdash;<br>
    Each an eternity of wild expectation,<br>
    And weary astonishment! &mdash; hour after hour!<br>
    And yet no other sound had being there,<br>
    Though, as I knew, one live, unmoving Thing<br>
    So near me stood in that blind solitude &mdash;<br>
    Stood waiting &mdash; wherefore? by the inner door.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><a name="PartIV"></a>Part IV </h2>
  <p>At last, all suddenly, in the air aloft,<br>
    O&rsquo;er the tower a wild, weird, wailful song<br>
    Woke flying, many-voiced; &mdash; then sweeping off<br>
    Out tow&rsquo;rds the echoey hills, so passed away<br>
    In dying murmurs through the hollow dark.<br>
  </p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="Song"></a>Song</b></h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  vain were our spells wrought &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  vain was She well taught<br>
    How that dread Watcher&rsquo;s eyes drowsy to keep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In  vein was the dragon-steed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  at the hour of need,<br>
    Out with his double-freight blissward to sweep.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost  &mdash; lost &mdash; lost &mdash; lost!<br>
    In vain were our spells of an infinite cost!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost  &mdash; lost &mdash; lost &mdash; lost!<br>
    Yon Gulf by a mortal may never be crossed&nbsp;<i>never!</i><br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The  doom holds for ever!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to aid her aught more<br>
    Is out of sphere and transcendeth our lore.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost  &mdash; lost &mdash; lost &mdash; lost!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come  away &mdash; come away.<br>

    Away to the mystic mid-regions of Sleep &mdash;<br>
    Of the beautiful Spirit of Sleep!<br>

  <p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
  <p>So passed that song (of which the drift alone<br>
    Is here reached after in such leaden speech<br>
    As uncharmed mortals use.) And when its tones<br>
    Out tow&rsquo;rds the mountains in the dark afar,<br>
    Had wasted, I grew sensible, methought,<br>
    Of seasonable change; &mdash; that now the Cell<br>
    Kept clarifying till the darkness seemed<br>
    Marbled with grey; and then the steed again,<br>
    With his strange dragon-claws and half spread wings,<br>
    And eke the tripod, where it still had stood,<br>
    Figured like shadows through the thinning gloom,<br>
    And gradually thence, by just the same<br>
    Degrees reversed in which they&rsquo;d faded there<br>
    Into the darkness as the night advanced,<br>
    Came forth in full development again.</p>
  <p>It was the Dawn: and thus it clearing kept,<br>
    Till through the eastern port a golden rod<br>
    Of light fell transiently, and so bespake<br>
    The sunrise! Oh, it was a desolate pass,<br>
    To feel, &mdash; immured in that relentless keep, &mdash;<br>
    How on the purple bills the sun was then<br>
    Rejoicing in his glory! Then to know<br>
    That he was wheeling up the heaven, and o&rsquo;er<br>
    My prison roof, &mdash; hour after hour, to think<br>
    How he was tracking with a step of fire<br>
    His midway course, and loudening through the world<br>
    The thunder of its universal life!<br>
    Or how his mighty orb had sloped in Time&rsquo;s<br>
    Descending scale, and thence was glorying down<br>
    Into the crimson waves of some wide sea<br>
    Beyond the Hesperides! But this, alas!<br>
    Was my dread fate while seven times day and night<br>
    So wearily came, &mdash; so wore away; and yet<br>
    I slept not! nor (to my amazement) there,<br>
    Through all this drear time, did the wintry tooth<br>
    Of hunger gnaw within my corporal frame!<br>
    No thirst inflamed me! While by the grim door<br>
    Which seemed to shut athwart some stairway, stood<br>
    That strange, unmoving, dragon-footed Steed,<br>
    As from the first, &mdash; and there the tripod, placed<br>
    As if to aid some fugitive to mount<br>
    At once &mdash; and fly! Mere wonder at my doom,<br>
    So unimaginably wild and vague,<br>
    Relieved the else-fixed darkness of despair.</p>
  <p>But on the seventh night, in the stillness, &mdash; hark!<br>
    What might I hear? A step? &mdash; a small light step,<br>
    That by the stair ascending, swiftly came<br>
    Straight to the inner door &mdash; then stopt. Alas!<br>
    The black leaf opened not; and yet, the while,<br>
    In evidence of some bright Being that out<br>
    Beyond it stood, a rainbow radiance through<br>
    Its solid breadth, in subtle wave on wave<br>
    Came flushing, &mdash; even as a sunset glow<br>
    Through some dense cloud upon the verge of heaven,<br>
    In swift rich curves wells percolating forth:<br>
    So came it &mdash; filling all the cell at length<br>
    With rosy lights that in the darkness fumed<br>
    Like luminous odors; at the scent of which,<br>
    The mystic steed, so rigid until then,<br>
    Moved, and spread wide his glimmering bat-like wings.<br>
    When hark! deep down in the mysterious Tower,<br>
    Another step? Yea, the same strenuous tramp<br>
    That once before I&rsquo;d heard big-beating up,<br>
    Came following &mdash; till a low sad cry without<br>
    Went to my heart, and I might hear ensue<br>
    A struggle as of one forced down the stair<br>
    By that so ruthless Guard! &mdash; down, till the cell<br>
    Again had darkened, and the Tower itself<br>
    Stood once more as in some mute void of Time,<br>
    Or depth of distance infinitely out,<br>
    Achingly still. But not for long! Again<br>
    The Monster&rsquo;s hateful tramp came booming up,<br>
    Quake above quake that with a shudder stopt<br>
    Dead at the door. It opened; and he stood<br>
    In dubious presence &rsquo;twixt the mighty jambs,<br>
    Filling the whole wide space. But ere the Fiend<br>
    Might enter farther, rage and hate at once<br>
    Possessed me, and I charged him! For awhile<br>
    His horrible glooms voluminously vague,<br>
    Yet with a smothering pressure in their folds,<br>
    Involved me! &mdash; concentrating more and more,<br>
    And lapping closer in yet denser coils,<br>
    Every dread moment! But my agony now,<br>
    My pain, and hate, and loathing, &mdash; all had grown<br>
    Into so vast a horror, that methought<br>
    I burst with irresistible strength away!<br>
    Rushed through the door, and down the stairway &mdash; down<br>
    An endless depth; till a portcullis, hinged<br>
    In the Tower&rsquo;s basement, opened to my flight!<br>
    No sooner had I passed it, than it fell<br>
    In thunder too! and thence my passage lay<br>
    Along the difficult ledges of a rock<br>
    Against whose base the Lake&rsquo;s long ripple  lapped.</p>
  <p>And when at last, breathless and faint, I paused<br>
In that so giddy flight, methought I saw<br>
The lustrous Lady up through the lit air<br>
Ascending, with a steadfast downward look<br>
Of parting recognition, &mdash; full of love,<br>
But painless, passionless. Upward she passed,<br>
Above the Tower, and o&rsquo;er the clouds, &mdash; and when<br>
Her radiance melted through heaven&rsquo;s marble dome<br>
And left it vacant in its infinite vastness,<br>
All things methought had changed, and I was there<br>
Standing alone in a wide waste that stretched<br>
On all hands out &mdash; illimitably out!<br>
Standing alone in a waste universe,<br>
That showed, as under an abortive dawn,<br>
Its grey immensity, and nothing more!<br>
Still, empty, objectless! &mdash; and thereupon<br>
There fell back on my soul a sense of loss<br>
So bleak, so desolate, that with a wild<br>
Sleep-startling outcry, suddenly I awoke!<br>
Awoke, to find it but a Dream of Wonder!<br>
Yet ever since to feel as if some pure<br>
And guardian Soul, out of the day and night,<br>
Had passed for ever from the reach of Love!<br>
Albeit I know, that to the Poet&rsquo;s mind,<br>
No light, no loveliness it once hath known,<br>
Though only through the mystery of a dream,<br>
Is after lost; but in effect remains,<br>
As comfort, or as wisdom, or as grace,<br>
In union with its substance evermore &mdash;<br>
A gathered portion of the life and might<br>
Of&nbsp;<i>His</i>&nbsp;predestined influence on the world.  </p>
