<h1><b>The Singing Garden</b></h1>
<p align="center">C. J. Dennis</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Foreword"></a>Foreword</b></h2>
<p>The  versatile C. J. Dennis has done it again! And this time he veritably couldn&rsquo;t  help it! For, after revealing himself as a great lover of mankind by his  sympathetic presentation of such whimsical characters as The Sentimental Bloke  and Ginger Mick, then restoring us to a proper spirit of humility by cleverly  convicting us all of outrageously Gluggish behaviour, he at last enters into  his true kingdom.</p>
<p>More  than one hint of the ardent nature-lover had already been given in his earlier  books; but here, for the first time, we discover the essential C. J. Dennis  who, like Mrs Browning, sees &ldquo;earth crammed with heaven and every common bush  a-fire with God,&rdquo; and hears, with Robert Burns, sweet hymns of praise &ldquo;from  choirs that lurk in hedge and birk.&rdquo; As he unrolls for us the varied pageantry  of the seasons in his forest home at Toolangi, we feel again how literally true  it is that</p>
<p class="note">We  are nearer God&rsquo;s heart in a garden<br>
Than anywhere else on earth.</p>
<p>Many  good folk own gardens&mdash;sometimes quite elaborate ones&mdash;to whom this revelation  has not yet come. To such there is now given the privilege of walking with the  poet in his Singing Garden, of learning to glimpse through his eyes something  of the glory hitherto unrevealed, and of sharing in the very real joy and satisfaction  that have come to him from his close communion with the birds and flowers and  trees that he loves so well and knows so intimately.</p>
<p>I  like the note upon which the book draws to its close. Indeed, it is not a  single note, but a full-throated chorus of joyous bush birds who &ldquo;vie with  flutings rare&rdquo; to proclaim to the listening world that, even while Winter is  still with us, &ldquo;Spring surely must be near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus,  once again, Dennis proves himself to be not only an unshaken optimist, but a  sound and sane philosopher. Let us all, as good Australians, be profoundly  grateful to the writer who has done more, perhaps, than any other to correct  the distorted vision of those earlier seers who declared the dominant note of  Australian scenery to be &ldquo;weird melancholy,&rdquo; and pictured the Australian bush  as &ldquo;funereal, secret, stern.&rdquo; Marcus Clarke&rsquo;s gloomy challenge&mdash;&ldquo;A poem like <i>L&rsquo;Allegro</i> could never be written by an  Australian. It is too airy, too sweet, too freshly happy&rdquo;&mdash;finds a triumphant  answer in <i>The Singing Garden</i> with its  unmistakable flavour of just this very freshness, sweetness and happiness. I  should like to see a well-thumbed copy in every school library in the  Commonwealth.<br>

  <p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Dawn"></a>Dawn</h2>
<p>Here&nbsp;in soft darkness where, the long watch thro&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dreamless, my quiet garden slumbered well,<br>
  Night&rsquo;s soothing fingers, all adrip with dew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crept in and out, to weave a mystic spell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er wilting bud and bell;<br>
  Now, with deft touches, deepening tints anew,<br>
  Now lifting up some languid suppliant who<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had wooed the sun too well.</p>
<p>In the  grey twilight tall trees seem to yawn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, waking, stretch their mighty limbs on high.<br>
  A small bird cheeps; and, silver in the dawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The jewelled wattles to a soft wind sigh<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard etched against the sky<br>
  The timbered hill-tops stand forth boldly drawn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  A sunbeam, laughing, trips across the lawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiling day is nigh.</p>
<p>The kindly offices of night are done.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grey thrush carols forth his morning hymn,<br>
  Then proud, triumphant of a new day won,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The magpie&rsquo;s trumpet tops a lofty limb.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the pool&rsquo;s mirrored brim<br>
  The drowsing daisies open one by one:<br>
  &ldquo;Wake, brothers, wake! Here comes our lord, the Sun!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look up and worship him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheWayoftheVandal"></a>The Way of the Vandal</h2>
<p><b>&ldquo;</b>Never&nbsp;kick a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was well on the way to middle-age before I became aware of that  entirely humane maxim attributed to the dear old lady who sought to reprove a  petulant small boy, who had aimed a kick at his pet magpie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willie, be kind to animals; and never, never kick a bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How much more pleasure might I have derived from the first quarter  century of life had I known and heeded that maxim and all that it implies. For  I fear that, during that period, my sole interest in birds had to do with their  destruction.</p>
<p>As a small boy I had my inevitable but fortunately brief  enthusiasm for egg collecting. And I still retain a vivid picture of a gang of  country urchins, myself among them, each with his trusty catapult, ruthlessly  hunting a purblind and stupid snowy owl through the sunlit gums on a pleasant  river bank, because an equally stupid lady teacher desired the wings to  decorate a hat.</p>
<p>Some time later, and while I was yet in my late &ldquo;teens,&rdquo; I became  aware of the brilliant scientific attainments of a certain legal gentleman in  our town. I remember him as a somewhat taciturn and unconventional legal  gentleman who disliked&mdash;in fact, affected to despise the pursuit of law. He  spent, on an average, about three hours each day at his legal office and  divided the remainder of his time between alcohol and ornithology, with a  slight bias in favour of alcohol.</p>
<p>During one expansive hour he condescended to show me his quite  remarkable collection of bird-skins, for some of which he had travelled far afield.  Each skin, with plumage intact and unruffled, was filled neatly with  cotton-wool and, each in its neat paper cylinder, duly labelled with its Latin  tab, was stored in a large cabinet.</p>
<p>There were, I think, some hundred skins in the collection, some of  them rarely beautiful still, as to colour. But I never troubled to discover  whether my savant drank at intervals to get away from the remorse his silly  hobby evoked, or whether he went after the birds to get away from the alcohol.</p>
<p>But the mere sight of that cabinet and its paper cylinders and  particularly the Latin tabs had immediately fired my young enthusiasm. Here, I  felt, was the highest expression of scientific achievement. Here was deep  learning and a high-road to a place far above my earthly associates. Oh, human  vanity!</p>
<p>Noting my interest, the savant consented to instruct me in the  painfully tedious process of separating a dead bird from its useless skin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One must,&rdquo; he explained, rather apologetically, &ldquo;in one&rsquo;s uttah  aisolation, so to speak, faind some kaind of&mdash;ah&mdash;culchahed employment in this  awful place, or one would go quaite insane. The natives are, of course,  quaite&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He shrugged despondently. (He had never been out of his native Australia, but he affected an exaggerated &ldquo;Oxford&rdquo; accent and a  tired manner by which he sought to suggest altitudes of erudition).</p>
<p>Then he grew more animated as he proceeded to instruct me in the  details of his repulsive hobby. First, exactly where to make the incision, how  carefully to draw forth each thigh-bone, strip it of flesh, replace this by a  winding of cotton-wool and gently push the bone back into place again.  Then&mdash;most ticklish and tedious process of all&mdash;how, with the pathetic little  body hooked to a &ldquo;gallows,&rdquo; to draw the skin inside out over the skull, extract  the brain, and so on, ad nauseam.</p>
<p>I cannot understand now why the poor man did not give the whole of  his spare time to alcohol. I imagine he must have had a weak stomach for some  things. For that gratuitous butchery strikes me now as an utterly asinine,  futile and filthy business.</p>
<p>But on that night &ldquo;Science&rdquo; was knocking at my door. Within a week  I had bought a small rifle capable of taking dust-shot cartridges, also an  inaccurate book on birds, forceps, arsenical soap, and what not. And, going out  into the pleasant places of the land, I slew beauty wherever I came upon it,  and silenced song even as it lifted to its triumph.</p>
<p>I had collected, I think, some twenty-five or thirty &ldquo;specimens&rdquo;  when the iconoclast, or Nemesis or somebody made a sudden and dramatic  appearance.</p>
<p>He came in the shape of a small, bald German chemist who also had  a lot of spare time, which he divided between alcohol and the painting of  atrocious pictures of bush scenes and bush birds. This pharmaceutical gentleman  disliked the legal gentleman and scorned his ornithology; while the scientist  derided the artist and scoffed at the glaring inaccuracies of his art. In each  the degree of enmity was controlled largely by the measure of his cups.</p>
<p>On the day of the crisis, as I remember, I had trudged many weary  miles to the slaughter of my first and only bee-eater, or rainbow bird, that  shy bush beauty with the remarkable tail feathers and raiment in which so many  vivid warring colours miraculously harmonize in a triumph of art that is beyond  all Art.</p>
<p>Merops ornatus I had already printed neatly on a gummed label  (after consulting my book) as, early on that winter evening I sat in my room  absorbed in the unclean rites of amateur taxidermy.</p>
<p>While I was so engrossed, the door was roughly thrust open and  Nemesis entered&mdash;small, bald and decidedly &ldquo;blotto&rdquo;; but still acutely sentient  and unpleasantly active. Ignoring entirely my falsely jovial greeting, he  swayed in the doorway for a time, very solemnly taking in the details of my  unlovely employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy it iss?&rdquo; he asked, quite suddenly and passionately. &ldquo;Vy it iss  you do dis&mdash;dis butcher veeork?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeking discretion in silence, I went on with the job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chah!&rdquo; he said, scornfully, and somewhat wetly. Then, tacking  around the table, came suddenly to anchor on a chair opposite. I did not glance  up and, for a time, but for the pleasantly rhythmic cadence of his hiccoughs, I  might have thought he slept.</p>
<p>When he spoke again, his voice had found a note of pathetic  entreaty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dose beeootiful beeords!&rdquo; he almost wept. &ldquo;Vy it iss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to glance up, and was astonished to encounter his staring  eyes awash with tears of pity. Seeking to hold my regard, he threw out his hand  in a wide gesture of appeal, and it came to rest and closed nervously upon my  learned book on birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy it iss?&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;Dose beeootiful, beeootiful beeords! You  kill him und peel him und dere iss nodding&mdash;nodding only silly skins. Vy it iss  you do not paint him, und he iss alife mit his leedle vuns yet, alreatty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I considered a reply, thought better of it, and turned back to my  work which was just at that critical stage when, with forceps and scalpel, I  was engaged in the delicate task of drawing the skin over merops&rsquo;s skull, and  the job claimed nearly all my attention.</p>
<p>But, shortly afterwards, I became aware that my sozzled German  friend had begun to breathe heavily. Knowing him of old, I toyed with the idea  of sudden violence, delivered more in kindness than in anger, before matters  became too heated.</p>
<p>But I decided otherwise; and fierce rancour sounded in his next  remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dot man!&rdquo; he bellowed. &ldquo;Dot man it iss who teach you to do der  veeork of der wicious wandall. Vot iss it but butcher veeork, und der teachings  of der slaughterhaus? Dot man, mit der brain of a lice, he kill, he vount, he  maim der lofty beeord dat iss for songs und der beauty of dis airt!&rdquo; He paused.  breathing hard. &ldquo;Und now you; you so young, so foolish. Ach! Vy it iss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Merops was proving a little difficult. The skin and skull were  parting reluctantly and, intent upon my horrible trade, I replied absently. I  forget exactly what I said; but certainly it was nothing in the least degree  provocative.</p>
<p>But, next moment, my book on birds came hurtling across the table,  reduced the cadaver of merops to mere mangled remains, scattered my tools about  the room, and smashed for ever my frail and filthy &ldquo;gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could arise in wrath, my bald accuser had rushed to my  beloved cabinet and, dragging precious paper cylinders from the shelves,  crumpled them and their contents with strong hands, savagely.</p>
<p>As I rushed around the table to rescue what remained of my  treasure, the berserk pushed me in the face with one of my largest  &ldquo;specimens&rdquo;&mdash;as I had time and wit to notice. (It was Theskiornis spinicollis,  no less&mdash;a hardly-won straw-necked ibis.)</p>
<p>Then I fell backward over a footstool and sprawled upon the floor.</p>
<p>Before I was minded to rise, the destruction had been completed.  Some he cast into the fire; others he trampled viciously underfoot; the  remainder he tore to pieces with his teeth in his rage to have done swiftly and  beyond repair. And all the time he was wailfully vocal, spluttering skin and  feathers, as he voiced a multilingual threnody that had for its burden &ldquo;Dose  lofly, beeootiful beeords!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When at last I was up and ready to do him violence, he had sunk  upon a couch and was weeping in bitter and unashamed abandon.</p>
<p>The room was littered with feathers; and it was as if the martyred  birds would do honour to their avenger. For, as he sat and wept, his bald, pink  head was encircled by a conqueror&rsquo;s chaplet of fine feathers and down which  clung to his nimbus of sparse fair hair. All that remained of Acanthorhynchus  tenuirostris was there with the last of Patroica ph&oelig;nicea to crown the triumph  of their champion.</p>
<p>And above his anguished brow there glowed, exactly central, a  scrap of that cerulean gem which had once bedecked in glory a radiant blue  wren.</p>
<p>Even an outraged ornithologist, baulked in his beloved  necrophilism, hardly ever becomes quite savage enough to use violence upon a  small, bald German who offers no defence and is indifferent to the fiercest and  coarsest recriminations. So I left him there, and resuming my seat, glowered  upon the wreckage of all my scientific hopes, while sobbing wrung his vitals.</p>
<p>After a time, I think he slept briefly, for he was very still. I  gazed upon his sagging body with &ldquo;eyes of brooding hate.&rdquo; (This was the phrase  which occurred to me at the time as singularly apt.)</p>
<p>Then, quite suddenly, he got up and, navigating around the table,  put a gently affectionate hand upon my resentful shoulder. Tears were still in  his eyes.</p>
<p>I looked up sulkily; and the last impression I had of him on that  stormy evening comprehended two light blue eyes wide with that damp, appealing  pathos which one sees sometimes in the eyes of too abjectly affectionate dogs.  A button of a nose glowed pinkly between and, beneath that, his little blond  moustache was festooned with tiny feathers of many hues. They reminded me quite  absurdly of those little multicoloured flags with which he was wont to festoon  his shop veranda when the town celebrated some gala occasion; and they  fluttered gaily in the gentle zephyr of a long, soft sigh as, patting my  shoulder with rare forgiveness, he turned and went out into the night, closing  the door with elaborate care for silence, as upon one who watched beside his  dead.</p>
<p>A great ornithologist may have been lost to the world that night;  and the world is no worse off for that. It was the end of my high dreaming of a  collection that would far surpass that of my legal friend. And, whether it was  that I was discouraged by the prospect of beginning all over anew, or because  the girl whom I was seeking to impress with my deep learning left the district  about that time, or because I had really been moved by my bald friend&rsquo;s display  of gross sentimentality, it is now difficult to say. But after that night I  never skinned another bird.</p>
<p>And I have since been deeply grateful to my tipsy sentimentalist,  for it may well be that he rescued me in time from that paralysing fate which,  since that day, I have seen overwhelm so many good and earnest men who, in  their plastic youth mistaking erudition for insight, have lived and ossified  and died with nothing won.</p>
<p>So once again birds went out of my life until I built my house in  this forest place and learned the value of their shining friendship.</p>
<p>In this book no attempt is made to add to man&rsquo;s scientific  knowledge of our birds. I write rather as one would write of valued friends,  seeking not to analyse their physical attributes, but accepting most of them  for what they are&mdash;trusting friends whose faults I am eager to overlook, while  their virtues I extol.</p>
<p>In the procession of seasons in this green land birds play an  important part, and it is of them that I write chiefly&mdash;but only of the birds I  know.</p>
<p>For nearly thirty years I have lived here in my Singing Garden,  seeking patiently to win pleasure from its every aspect of sight and song and  scent. If, now, I can impart some of that very real joy to my readers this book  will have achieved its purpose.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respite from the world&rsquo;s dull fretting?<br>
  Come then to a secret place&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man&rsquo;s entanglements forgetting&mdash;<br>
  Deep within the forest dreaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep within its shadows cool,<br>
  Where the mountain waters streaming<br>
  Broaden to the placid beaming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a quiet pool.</p>
<p>Making  here a great green tent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tea-tree bough and wattle bending&mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shielding beauty&mdash;droop, defending<br>

<p>Rage the  tempest as it may<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the tree-tops, writhing, broiling;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frailer loveliness despoiling;<br>
  Summer&rsquo;s scorn and Winter&rsquo;s bluster<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seek in vain this hallowed spot<br>
  Lending its translucent lustre<br>
  To the nodding ferns that cluster<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many a mossy grot.</p>
<p>Steeply slope the banks above,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the outer turmoil muting;<br>
  Softly, bush birds&rsquo; songs of love<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Match an organ&rsquo;s mellow fluting.<br>
  Here is peace past all conceiving<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this forest chancel, here<br>
  Spreads a grace that transmutes grieving<br>
  To hushed wonder, to believing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God is very near.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;love&nbsp;all gum-trees well. But, best of  all,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love the tough old warriors that tower<br>
  About these lawns, to make a great green wall<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And guard, like sentries, this exotic bower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of shrub and fern and flower.<br>
  These are my land&rsquo;s own sons, lean, straight and tall,<br>
  Where crimson parrots and grey gang-gangs call<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; many a sunlit hour.</p>
<p>My  friends, these grave old veterans, scarred and stern,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changeless throughout the changing seasons they.<br>
  But at their knees their tall sons lift and yearn&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slim spars and saplings&mdash;prone to sport and sway<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like carefree boys at play;<br>
  Waxing in beauty when their young locks turn<br>
  To crimson, and, like beacon fires burn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deck Spring&rsquo;s holiday.</p>
<p>I think of Anzacs when the dusk comes down<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the gums&mdash;of Anzacs tough and tall.<br>
  Guarding this gateway, Diggers strong and brown.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when, thro&rsquo; Winter&rsquo;s thunderings, sounds their  call,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Anzacs, too, they fall&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  Their ranks grow thin upon the hill&rsquo;s high crown:<br>
  My sentinels! But, where those ramparts frown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their stout sons mend the wall. </p>

  To far summits, there the snow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lingers yet. But down below<br>
  In the quiet, green-girt places,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where full many a swift creek races<br>
  From the snow-lands to the sea,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now breaks sudden harmony.</p>
<p>Where  this tree-walled clearing dreams,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the frozen ramparts lie.<br>
  Now from dew-wet leaves a-glitter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes a little drowsy twitter,<br>
  And the first swift spear of light<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wounds at last the stubborn night.</p>
<p>Flashing  now, bright javelins<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pierce the murk; and now begins&mdash;<br>
  As day&rsquo;s gleaming ranks deploy&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morning&rsquo;s canticle of joy.<br>
  First a sleepy chuckle, breaking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tells of Laughing Jack awaking,<br>
  Pausing; then, from tree to tree,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaps unbound hilarity.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the signal&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Morning&rsquo;s hush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetness shatters, as grey thrush,<br>
  Vieing with the seraphim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts his liquid matin hymn.<br>
  Golden whistler joins him then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now red robin, now blue wren;<br>
  Magpie&rsquo;s clarion, sounding, swelling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caps the eager chorus welling,<br>
  As a wealth of varied notes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pouring from these tuneful throats,<br>
  Lifting, drifting, soars on high,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to greet morn&rsquo;s glowing sky. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="BlandishingtheBirds"></a>Blandishing the Birds</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;honourable company of bird-lovers,  we are told, is rapidly increasing in numbers in all parts of the country; and  while one delights to observe this growing interest in our native  songsters&mdash;many of them rare and exquisite beauty that reveals itself sometimes  only after long and intimate observation&mdash;it must be recognized that there are  bird-lovers and bird-lovers. Quite possibly, there are also more than a few  bird-lovers; but, so far, I have succeeded in isolating only two of these  groups.</p>
<p>So long as one manages to keep one&rsquo;s enthusiasm within reasonable  bounds, and refrains from being an absolute bore, much virtue may lie in  bird-loving.</p>
<p>But when your bird-lover, ignoring the restraint, develops into a  bird-bore and a pestiferous crank, he or she is something to avoid.</p>
<p>Perhaps you know the sort of thing I mean. Imagine yourself a  week-end guest at the country shack of a family, all of whom have gone  perfectly potty about native bird life; so much so that you expect them to  break out in feathers at any moment themselves.</p>
<p>With an appetite made keen by the country air, you are seated, let  us say, at breakfast, and, having taken the raw edge off your hunger, have  launched off confidently on your favourite conversational topic.</p>
<p>Just as you are about to make the first and most important point,  demanding close and intelligent attention, the host suddenly sits bolt upright  in his chair, as if he had been shot, and, forefinger erect, and head cocked  knowingly aslant, burbles rudely and irrelevantly: &ldquo;Pst! Hush! Listen! Surely  that was the call of the red-rumped Athanthisa! How unusual at this time of  year. Let&rsquo;s go out and investigate&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole family rises forthwith and rushes out of doors; and you  must either sit tight and breakfast boorishly alone, or go out with the rest  and develop crick-in-the-neck gazing foolishly up innumerable trees, while the  bacon lies in rapidly congealing fat, the kidneys grow cold, and the ants  gleefully discover the marmalade. Finally, at the end of some twenty minutes,  when one has bruised both shins and tripped over every protruding root in the  paddock, the amazing discovery is made that the songster is not a red-rumped  Athanthisa at all. It is a short-tailed stint, or even, perhaps, a  yellow-bellied shrike-tit.</p>
<p>Then everyone troops hack to a ruined breakfast, exclaiming  brightly: &ldquo;Fancy making a mistake like that! So absurd, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother, have you, too, suffered?</p>
<p>But this brings me to the rather humiliating confession that even  I and my household at one time came dangerously near to developing this  terrible malady.</p>
<p>In this country cottage, we had cajoled and fed and fraternized  with certain robins and grey thrushes and magpies until they fearlessly took  food from our hands. Already the virus was working insidiously within us, when  an artist friend came to stay and observe, and remained to heap scorn on our  Arcadian employ.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blandishing the birds,&rdquo; he called it, and waxing ethical and  psychological and ornithological, he proceeded to read us a severe and  chastening lecture.</p>
<p>He held that all this feeding and unnatural friendship&mdash;especially  with very young birds&mdash;was merely pauperizing, for our own selfish satisfaction  and love of display, a free, independent and hitherto happy race of people who  were far better left to their own devices.</p>
<p>It was, he said, undermining insidiously their natural  self-reliant qualities, teaching them laziness and mendicity and generally  upsetting the beautiful balance of nature.</p>
<p>He pictured the painfully crude efforts of this inept sissy-bird  to dig up a living for himself thereafter, his fumbling attempts, with  undeveloped vision and ineffective beak, to acquire, at the age of six months,  a trade which every self-respecting &ldquo;uncivilized&rdquo; young bird begins to master  before he is more than a few weeks old.</p>
<p>He painted, in glowing word pictures, the despair, the shame, the  growing inferiority complex of this unhappy fledgeling&mdash;a complex magnified by  the ribald mockery of his normally efficient fellows, whose derision mounted to  savage contempt and ended at last in physical violence.</p>
<p>We were almost in tears when our friend had finished his harrowing  recital, and I, for one, might have been wholly convinced had he not utterly  stultified his own argument early next morning as we observed him through a  window.</p>
<p>Thinking himself unseen, he spent half an hour in patient but  clumsy efforts to induce a yellow robin to accept from his hand a soggy lump of  cold rice pudding&mdash;a food which yellow robins very rightly scorn and despise.</p>
<p>But still I am left with my quandary, which some real nature  student may be able to solve: Can man improve upon nature, and does a  blandished bird lose caste?</p>

<p>I come in blossom-time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singing down the sunny days,<br>
  All their sweetness proffering, the flowers bend and nod,<br>
  With bee and butterfly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sharing now the honey days,<br>
  I sip the cup&rsquo;s kind offering and sing my grace to God.</p>

<p>Now&nbsp;upon the trellis sitting,<br>
  Now along the fencetop flitting,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meekly modest in my attitudes and poses;<br>
  &rsquo;Neath my breast incarnadine<br>
  Can this midget heart of mine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hold one half the vanity my song discloses?</p>
<p>First a  nervous little flutter,<br>
  Now a chirp and now a stutter,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I lift my snow-flecked crown to the refrain<br>
  Of my plaintive little ditty:<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, the pity! What a pity!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and isn&rsquo;t it a pity my poor Jenny is so plain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>See, my  burning front of flame<br>
  Puts the crimson rose to shame;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my singing leads the chorus of the morning;<br>
  But my silent little mate,<br>
  Mute upon the garden gate,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sober Jenny, hasn&rsquo;t any such adorning.</p>
<p>Tho&rsquo; I&rsquo;m handsomer than others,<br>
  Do not think I boast, my brothers;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m the meekest little chorister a-wing.<br>
  Still, I&rsquo;m tuneful, wise and witty,<br>
  Can you doubt, who hears my ditty?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah, but isn&rsquo;t it a pity that my Jenny cannot sing!&rdquo;</p>

  A greener and a colder land<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loved well by melodies;<br>
  And with her venturers came I<br>

  No exile, ever mourning here<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ever liquid lay.</p>
<p>At  dawning and at evening<br>

  Up from the gully &rsquo;mid the gums<br>

  I join the chorusing that comes<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From twice a hundred throats.</p>
<p>Alien no longer, merrily<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My melodies I&rsquo;ve brought;<br>
  The bushland offers cheerily<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sanctu&rsquo;ry I&rsquo;ve sought.<br>
  And, where the swift creek sings and turns<br>
  &rsquo;Mid wattle-trees and nodding ferns,<br>

<p>Now&nbsp;comes the blossoming. At Beauty&rsquo;s  birth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promise is brought to proud accomplishment,<br>
  And all things hymn the glory of the earth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this great symphony so subtly blent<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sight and sound and scent,<br>
  Weaving with all a note of carefree mirth,<br>
  Singing of sudden riches, boundless worth,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now to be freely spent.</p>
<p>Upon the hills the gum-leaves wink and shine:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wattle has put off her bridal dress<br>
  To droop brown tresses delicately fine;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every window frames some loveliness<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too potent to express:<br>
  Of roses burning by the trellised vine,<br>
  Of poppy, clematis and columbine<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flowers born to bless.</p>
<p>Now glowing day succeeds each dewy night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And beauty shouts in every living thing.<br>
  Across the pool&rsquo;s still face, in frantic flight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon-flies flash by. Now well a-wing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nestlings learn to sing;<br>
  And, as the chorus gathers to its height,<br>
  All nature joins the paean of delight.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the blossoming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ThisLonelyForest"></a>This Lonely Forest</h2>
<p>That&nbsp;alleged &ldquo;loneliness&rdquo; which some city  visitors assure me would inevitably overwhelm them were they compelled to live  for long in this quiet forest place, seems to me a state of mind rather hard to  capture during recent days. Yet, where one has learned to find life and  pageantry, others would possibly discover only boredom and unutterable  weariness of mind.</p>
<p>From my bed, close beside an upper window, my whole world  comprises a few square yards of lawn (backed by laurel, lucerne, and japonica,  all in flower) a mere scrap of garden border, and, in the right foreground,  close beside my head a huge hawthorn just breaking into bud.</p>
<p>Upon this delectable stage dramas of absorbing interest are  enacted. The characterization is perfect, the plots varied and realistic; the  love interest perfectly sustained; and the performance is continuous.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous sparrows supply ballet and chorus and fill most of the  low comedy roles; soubrette and ing&eacute;nue parts are supplied by dainty thornhill  honeyeaters; hawk, currawong and kookaburra are the bold, bad villains, and the  prima donna is a golden-voiced grey thrush.</p>
<p>Just at present, domestic drama is the order of the day. In some  cases, nests are just being built; in others, the first brood is already well  a-wing and the second on its way.</p>
<p>One morning lately, a diminutive honeyeater perched for rest in  the hawthorn. She bore in her beak a downy white feather, which she had  garnered from the pigeon loft. Her air of matronly triumph told plainly of the  downy feather&rsquo;s destination.</p>
<p>Presently, down beside her, perched an old friend of mine, one Sam  Sparrow, an avian tough and feathered trickster if ever there was one. I failed  to overhear the conversation; but his manner was friendly, the pert cock of his  head eloquent of quizzical banter.</p>
<p>Then, not forcefully, not aggressively, but tenderly and gently  polite, he removed the feather from the honeyeater&rsquo;s reluctant bill and bore it  to his own nest.</p>
<p>Half an hour later (and this is where I will not be believed) as  if to emphasize how like are birds to men in simple trustfulness, the same  honeyeater was back on the same hawthorn branch with another white feather  toilfully acquired. Sure enough, the wily Sam Sparrow again &ldquo;strutted his  stuff,&rdquo; while a puzzled honeyeater brooded upon this world&rsquo;s lack of justice  for the witless and the weak.</p>
<p>A few mornings later, into this sunny, singing world, grim tragedy  came swooping out of the blue. A kestrel had made his kill, and was gone. For a  while the lusty singing gave place to scared silence; then one by one the songs  burst forth again.</p>
<p>But the usually bright and perky Sam Sparrow since then has lost  much of his debonair and carefree mien. Also, since then, his demure little  wife is missing.</p>
<p>These are but passing incidents in the morning&rsquo;s many-sided drama.  To tell it all would need a volume.</p>
<p>But what has quite absurdly delighted me most of all lately is the  triumph of the swallows.</p>
<p>For several years now, welcome swallows have been attempting to  build under my window hood. But each year their masonry fails to cling to the  painted wall, and each year they have given up in despair and built elsewhere.</p>
<p>This year, the same persistent pair&mdash;or perhaps others more  ingenious&mdash;have discovered a shelving timber close under the hood, and this year  the nest is complete.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why I should be so ridiculously pleased about it.  Perhaps it is that, while to most the swallow is a remotely distant creature of  the upper air, having little in common with man, I have, before this, known him  intimately.</p>
<p>And I know, too, that when these strangely gentle and friendly  people have built their home and the most urgent household cares are done, I  shall be regaled each morning this summer with one of Birdland&rsquo;s sweetest,  purest, gayest, yet least celebrated, songs.</p>

<p>Dawn&nbsp;came this morning ominous and grim.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The circle of the sun rose bloated where,<br>
  Seen thro&rsquo; the scudding cloud, its angry rim<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burned dull and copper hued&mdash;a sullen glare.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stale and lifeless air<br>
  Made no least little stir &rsquo;mid leaf and limb<br>
  Of great trees brooding round this garden trim;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A listening fear seemed there.</p>
<p>Listening and waiting. Then a far, faint roar<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spread from the furthest hills. A sudden breeze,<br>
  Swelling in volume, thro&rsquo; the forest tore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until it seemed the tossing, tortured trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Writhed in fierce agonies.<br>
  The crashing trunks sounded as guns in war,<br>
  And tumult reigned, as of some rock-bound shore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Defying angry seas.</p>
<p>Waning to wax again with gathered power,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All day it raged, and leapt from hill to hill,<br>
  Shouting its wrath&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Now, with a healing shower,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quiet comes down, and all seems strangely still.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind has had its will<br>
  With riven loveliness of shrub and flower;<br>
  But round the ruin storm-scarred monarchs tower<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unconquerable still.</p>

<p>Day&nbsp;after day, week after burning week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ruthless sun has sucked the forest dry.<br>
  Morn after anxious morn men&rsquo;s glances seek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hills, hard-etched against a harder sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gay blossoms droop and die.<br>
  Menace is here, as day draws to its peak,<br>
  And, &rsquo;mid the listless gums along the creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hot little breezes sigh.</p>
<p>To-day the threat took shape; the birds were dumb.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more, as sullen, savage morning broke,<br>
  The silence told that trembling fear had come,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bird and beast and all the forest folk.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One little wisp of smoke<br>
  Far in the south behind the listless gum<br>
  Grew to a purple pall. Like some far drum,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A distant muttering broke.</p>
<p>Red noon beheld red death come shouting o&rsquo;er<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These once green slopes&mdash;a leaping, living thing.<br>
  Touched by its breath, tree after tall tree wore<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fiery crown, as tho&rsquo; to mock a king&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ghastly blossoming<br>
  Of sudden flame that died and was no more.<br>
  And, where a proud old giant towered of yore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood now a blackened thing.</p>
<p>Fierce raved the conquering flame, as demons rave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth shook to thunders of the falling slain.<br>
  Brambles and bushes, once so gay and brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrank back, and writhed, and shrieked and shrieked  again<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sentient things in pain.<br>
  Gone from the forest all that kind spring gave&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  And now, at laggard last, too late to save,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes soft, ironic rain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Recuperation"></a>Recuperation</h2>
<p>You&nbsp;must imagine this Singing Garden  of ours, a remote and rather unexpected patch of livelier green, set among the  dark green of gum- and wattle-trees in a land without horizons. It occupies a  little forest clearing, not more than three acres in extent, approached by a  mountain road winding and twisting as it climbs about the timbered hills to the  summit of the Great Dividing Range. So that,  in the abruptness with which the garden bursts upon the traveller&rsquo;s view lies  much of what charm it has. This sudden vista is, perhaps, a little unexpected  and something of a relief to eyes that have discovered no break for many a mile  along the green-walled highway save brief glimpses of the winding road ahead  and other infrequent clearings such as this, hewn laboriously by the settler  out of the stubborn bush.</p>
<p>On every side of us tower great green battlements of giant  eucalypt, of acacia and many lesser scrubs, making a barrier almost  impenetrable save where the road pierces its dense shadow and leads down to the  open country and the far-flung skyline&mdash;a relief to behold sometimes, after too  long confinement in this pleasant prison. Here there is no remote horizon as  plain-dwellers know it; for our skyline, indefinite yet intimate, is lifted  high along ragged tops of the nearer trees, so that we dwell in a narrow world  of our own that permits but rarely, and only from its higher eminences,  restricted glimpses of a wider world below.</p>
<p>For far the greater part of the year it is a prison, pleasant  enough and holding much content excepting, perhaps, on sodden, winter days of  incessant rain when clouds drop down to wreathe the tree-tops, till the sense  of close confinement renders the mind as sodden as the day and one longs  acutely for the sun.</p>
<p>Then upon some dry summer, when the threat of forest fires is all  about us, our sheltering walls themselves take their part in a menace not easy  to ignore.</p>
<p>During the first few years of our sojourn we had witnessed many local  bush-fires, disquieting enough while they raged and while the threat of their  extension held. But they died young and were forgotten, leaving little sign of  their passing and causing no breach in our great, living walls.</p>
<p>It was not until the year of the great fires, when men, women and  children died horrible deaths in forest places such as this&mdash;when whole  settlements were trapped to perish in the flame&mdash;that we had our one and  terrifying experience of a truly great forest fire in all its ruthless might,  and its magnificence.</p>
<p>It came upon us one sultry forenoon, heralded by a ghastly purple  cloud that swiftly overspread the sky, plunging all into a horrible and uncanny  twilight that seemed to foreshadow evils unimagined&mdash;a foretaste of who knows  what agonizing hell.</p>
<p>It came to us, roaring and leaping&mdash;a solid front of flame, two  miles across and as high almost as the tallest trees.</p>
<p>We fought it along a narrow track not fifty yards from the homes  of most of us; and, as the lazy little flames of our counter-fire crept upwind  to meet that raging, awe-inspiring enemy, our case seemed desperate enough. The  fierce excitement and the urgent need to save, if possible, our  properties&mdash;indeed, for a few terrible moments, it seemed our very  lives&mdash;excluded any thought of the inevitable doom even then encompassing many a  pleasant and familiar prospect we had long known and loved.</p>
<p>It was only after the third day, when we had dealt with the last  of the destroyer&rsquo;s smouldering after-rage, that we had opportunity to gauge our  loss in forest beauty.</p>
<p>On two sides of us, where once the gay green walls had greeted us  with a hundred verdant variations, now loomed black desolation. The destruction  seemed utter and irremediable. The insatiable flame had licked up every last  vestige of green, every twig and branch; and now the great trees stood charred  and naked, lifting blackened, mutilated arms to heaven as if in bitter  remonstrance; while spar and sapling were mere burnt sticks standing starkly  between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In five years,&rdquo; we thought&mdash;&ldquo;may be ten years, a merciful green  mantle will spring up to clothe in part this ghastly evidence of insensate  destruction and the criminal carelessness of man. But now and for ever has the  full beauty of this forest setting gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But here we reckoned without knowledge of wise Nature&rsquo;s  inexplicable foresight and the truly amazing miracle of the latent leaf.</p>
<p>Every tall mountain-ash had gone indeed, beyond redemption; but  messmate and blue-gum have secret reserves long held in readiness,  astonishingly, for just such a desperate need. Hidden beneath the armour of the  tough, protecting bark, these latent, embryonic leaves have been lurking, maybe  for years, never to burgeon and develop and mature in outer air, except in  answer to the urgent summons of dire necessity such as this.</p>
<p>And now, almost before the last of the smouldering logs and  tree-trunks had been quenched and cooled by laggard rain, Nature&mdash;so prodigally  spendthrift in many of her habits, so miraculously provident in others&mdash;hastened  to call up her long dormant reserves.</p>
<p>Within a very few weeks little flecks and patches of vivid young  green appeared upon the blackened&mdash;seemingly lifeless&mdash;trunks and limbs. For a  time they seemed altogether incongruous, these joyous signs of laughing young  life in a scene so darkly tragic. It made a strange picture, variously  described by certain city friends of ours who gazed upon it. &ldquo;A symphony in  ebon and emerald!&rdquo; gushed the soulfully aesthetic. &ldquo;Like an army of niggers  with green hair,&rdquo; suggested the strictly prosaic.</p>
<p>These life-preserving growths, so mysteriously quickened,  multiplied and developed amazingly and soon, as the eager young leaves spread  joyfully to the sun, the stricken giants began to breathe again.</p>
<p>Young wattles too, and many of the lesser scrubs&mdash;from seeds  hastened to germination by the heat of the very same fire that destroyed the  parent tree&mdash;broke through black earth, made yet more fertile by the cooling  ashes of the slain; and in the next year, except for here and there a glimpse  of charred trunk. little evidence remained of the destroyer&rsquo;s passing.</p>
<p>To-day we have our green walls back once more. And when we speak  of the Great Fire to but half-credulous visitors, gazing upon these once again  unbroken barriers of variegated green, it is hard to discover enough evidence  to convince doubters that the threat was ever really serious or the havoc  seemingly so hopeless and complete.</p>
<p>And now we are told that our rejuvenated monarchs are no longer of  much use to the marauding saw-miller. Their value in the greedy eye of the  ruthless, commercial profit-taker has departed. For this, too, we shamelessly  offer thankfulness unqualified.</p>

<p>Where&nbsp;the mountain waters glide,<br>
  Where no summer noon may burn,<br>
  Where the platypuses hide<br>
  Snug amid the coral fern;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the cool, green twilights play<br>
  And the darting dragon-fly<br>

<p>Here my  pendant home is hung&mdash;<br>
  A leafy cradle, cobweb girt&mdash;<br>

<p>In the  open I am shy;<br>
  Vanishing in coy distress<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sudden, close beside your head,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There  am I.</p>
<p>Sing the waters where they flow,<br>
  Sing the thrushes high above,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fretted shade and dappled sun,<br>
  Muted song and lullaby;<br>

<p>Even&nbsp;among the tits and wrens<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And birds of scanty inches,<br>
  Small fowl of shaded forest glens,<br>
  The lesser warblers and their hens<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And little chats and finches<br>
  I hold an unassuming place,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In lowly regions winging;<br>

<p>Where  sunshafts pierce the denser scrub,<br>

  Singing my little song the while<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who care to listen,<br>

<p>No noisy chorister am I<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bedecked in gaudy vesture;<br>
  On no wide venturings I fly<br>
  &rsquo;Mid tree-tops towering to the sky.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less lordly is my gesture.<br>
  I lodge and labour with the meek<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In secret ways and scented,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfamed, but well contented. </p>

<p>I&nbsp;am&nbsp;cursed with a cackle whenever I  tackle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soulful and lilting refrain;<br>
  But a frivolous snicker, like some fool in liquor,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is not what I seek to attain.<br>
  For I have, on the whole, quite a musical soul<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which I seek to express as I may.<br>
  And it&rsquo;s simply absurd to suppose that a bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as I, makes a laugh of his lay.</p>
<p>In early  October I&rsquo;m specially sober<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And loaded with household affairs;<br>
  And myself and my wife lead no trivial life<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That inclines us to laugh at our cares,<br>
  So, if you should suppose that our song is jocose,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re entitled of course, to your views,<br>
  But to us, her and me, it&rsquo;s a sweet symphony<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And inspired by our mutual muse.</p>
<p>When I soulfully sing in the bourgeoning spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With true poetry bursting my heart,<br>
  It is hard if I seem to express in my theme<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some coarse phase of the comical art.<br>
  And yet, what&rsquo;s the good? Since I&rsquo;m misunderstood<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m content to submit to the wrong.<br>
  And tho&rsquo; &ldquo;Ock, ock, oo, hoo&rdquo; may seem funny to you,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Tis to me a delectable song. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another alien singer, I,<br>
  Nursed upon England&rsquo;s  flowery wealds,<br>
  Seeking no tithe of treasured yields,<br>

  Its gold about your timbered hills.</p>
<p>A mite in splendid motley clad,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dance about your cattle&rsquo;s feet,<br>

  To linger yet a little while.</p>
<p>No ingrate I, no niggard churl&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tho&rsquo; what I take you well may spare&mdash;<br>
  Ere azure skies have grown to pearl,<br>
  With many a grace-note, many a skirl,<br>

  There is no haven in the tree,<br>
  There is no harbour safe from me;<br>
  In many a singing sanctuary<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My meat I seek.</p>
<p>Beware! The swift grey ghost is out!<br>
  Be still! Grey death lurks near about!<br>
  Crouch close! Shrink low!&mdash;But have no doubt<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve marked my kill.<br>
  Grim Nemesis, I never fail;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White-shafted, my important tail<br>

  Arrayed in my funeral dress.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the fishermen rave, and in anger they speak:<br>

<p>But I&rsquo;m  quick and I&rsquo;m cunning, as many a greyling,<br>
  A blackfish, a trout or a bream<br>
  Has known to his sorrow when down I go sailing<br>
  To hunt him beneath the dark stream.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my cavernous maw then they all come alike,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And &rsquo;tis death should the little black cormorant  strike.</p>
<p>But I am an outlaw. I&rsquo;m hunted and harried.<br>
  I&rsquo;m banned from the havens of men.<br>

  A shot o&rsquo;er the waters&mdash;and then,<br>

<p>Never while one bushland lover<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Camps beneath the great sky&rsquo;s cover,<br>

  Olden pictures in the fire,<br>

  Forth beyond the ken of folk,<br>
  Shall my night call fail&mdash;<br>

<p>Far&nbsp;in the forest depths I dwell,<br>
  The master mimic of them all,<br>
  To pour from out my secret dell<br>
  Echo of many a bushland call,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That over all the forest spills;<br>
  Echo of many a birdland note,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When out about the timbered hills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds all that borrowed lore that fills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My  magic throat.</p>
<p>I am the  artist. Songs to me<br>
  From all this gay green land are sped;<br>
  And when the wondrous canopy<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glorious veil, at even&rsquo;s hush&mdash;<br>
  Above my head, I do my part;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then wren and robin, finch and thrush&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All are re-echoed in a rush<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of  perfect art.</p>
<p>Here by  my regal throne of state,<br>
  To serve me for a swift retreat,<br>
  The little runways radiate;<br>
  And when the tread of alien feet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Draws near I vanish: ever prone<br>
  To quick alarm when aught offends<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That secret ritual of the throne.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My songs are for my mate alone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And  favoured friends.</p>
<p>I am the artist. None may find,<br>
  In all the world, a match for me:<br>
  Rare feathered loveliness combined<br>
  With such enchanting minstrelsy.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a land vocal with gay song<br>
  I choose whate&rsquo;er I may require;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wait, I listen all day long,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then to the music of a throng<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tune  my lyre. </p>

<p>Now&nbsp;comes the time when quiet showers soothe<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wounds of Summer&rsquo;s too intense embrace,<br>
  And gentle hands reach down softly to smooth<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wrinkles from the garden&rsquo;s sun-seared face;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick little breezes race<br>
  Down thro&rsquo; the forest; swell, and die again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And saplings toss like merry boys at play,<br>
  And tall, time-roughened trees, like grave old men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forgetting that the years have made them grey,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laugh with the laughing day.</p>
<p>The  adolescent gaiety of Spring<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long since has gone; the nestling birds have flown<br>
  Upon their own affairs on practised wing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon to devise housekeeping of their own;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The garden&rsquo;s guise has grown<br>
  Sedate, yet, waxing in maturity,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waxes in loveliness. No longer frail,<br>
  Brighter and sturdier blossoms tempt the bee<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For yet a space, before they droop and fail<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Neath Winter&rsquo;s bitter flail.</p>
<p>Then flit  about this fragrant countryside<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exotic elves who ride the scented breeze:<br>
  Exiled but merry artists, ranging wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This land, to deck their lovely English trees<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Autumn&rsquo;s harmonies.<br>
  Her mellow mood has laughed out Summer&rsquo;s pride;<br>
  And her gay henchmen, not to be denied,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet riot as they please.</p>
<p>Past  wattles dreaming of Spring&rsquo;s coming song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the land these gay elves peer and peek;<br>
  Past blackwood, Christmas-bush and kurrajong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past grave old gums that mark the dwindling creek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For canvases they seek.<br>
  And in this clearing, sown these summers long<br>
  With ash and sumach, birch and poplar strong,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make one merry week.</p>
<p>Now in my  garden, as each morning comes,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In waxing beauty is the picture spread:<br>
  Before green backgrounds of the sober gums<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dawn purple, russet-brown and gold and red;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tenderer green has fled.<br>
  And while grim Winter rolls advancing drums,<br>
  In splendid motley, as each leaf succumbs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool earth is carpeted.</p>
<p>Red glows the sumach by the poplar&rsquo;s gold;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Translucent amber, burning bright and clear,<br>
  Like hope aflame, and tints a thousandfold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marching in glorious pageantry appear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High festival is here<br>
  That laughs at death&mdash;a wonder to behold&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; sigh the trees, &ldquo;we sleep; for we are cold.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call us when Spring is near.&rdquo; </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheKookaburraMurderCase"></a>The Kookaburra Murder Case</h2>
<p>During&nbsp;the last few days I have received  letters contradicting, upbraiding, abusing, impeaching and downright  bully-ragging me for daring, in a recent article, to number the kookaburra  amongst the bold, bad villains of Birdland!</p>
<p>I think I can quite understand the sentimental indignation that  moves my various correspondents to arise and slang me for traducing their best  beloved bird in all the Australian bush.</p>
<p>I can appreciate the swift desire to retaliate in defence of a  jovial old friend, because even I, well as I know him, can not entirely shed  what is more than a passing regard for the hoary old humbug.</p>
<p>But I, unlike my correspondents, have had more than one glimpse  behind that air of bland benevolence with which he deceives his millions of  admirers. And, because of long and intimate association, I am able to judge  him, uninfluenced by that tradition which has built about him a reputation for  jocund good-will and jovial friendliness, so apt to hoodwink his casual  acquaintances.</p>
<p>His continuous joviality no one can help admitting; and I am  prepared to concede his trustful and friendly demeanour toward human  associates. But to see him through the eyes of the smaller and weaker  inhabitants of Birdland is to discover in him a character altogether different  from that of the kindly kookaburra of tradition.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I do not propose to answer the various charges that his  indignant champions have brought against me; but to defend myself by putting  John Kookaburra himself in the dock and appointing myself chief counsel for the  prosecution. Therefore:&mdash;</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen of the jury:</p>
<p>The prosecution had at first been minded to charge the prisoner,  John Kookaburra, with being Public Enemy No. 1 of the Australian Avian nation;  but, since the Crow (or Raven) seems long ago to have well earned that  unenviable title, we do couple the accused with his cousin, the Butcher Bird,  as Enemy No. 2.</p>
<p>Such open and natural enemies as the hawk and eagle, the kite,  falcon and kestrel we exclude from consideration, since Nature allows them no  means of subsistence save through cannibalism.</p>
<p>But John Kookaburra stands charged as Public Enemy No. 2, because,  under cover of an external aspect of sniggering and sanctimonious  good-fellowship, he carries on a horrible and secret trade in murder,  kidnapping, torture, cannibalism and infanticide.</p>
<p>We have proof further, so we maintain, that he is a habitual  criminal who, from nest to necropolis lives the life of a giggling gangster and  an incorrigible racketeer.</p>
<p>We are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the defence will produce  a number of reputable witnesses (mostly human) who will testify to the  prisoner&rsquo;s reputation for jovial good nature, perpetual love of laughter, and  his kindly, not to say canonical aspect of beneficent altruism that is hard to  associate with such charges as the prosecution will endeavour to maintain.</p>
<p>The prosecution is prepared to admit all this, and indeed to cite  it as proof of the extreme cunning of the benevolent-seeming prisoner in the  dock.</p>
<p>But we too, ladies and gentlemen, will put forward witnesses,  human and avian, who are prepared to swear to certain specific and definite  crimes committed by the accused.</p>
<p>Twice at least he has been known to seize young thrushes from the  nest, and, having battered out their brains despite the frantic protests of the  parents, to carry them away for what ghastly purpose I leave you to imagine.</p>
<p>As recently as last week, the prisoner was seen, by several  witnesses, with a living, half-fledged blue wren in his murderous beak. A mere  infant, ladies and gentlemen! A child of tender years who had not yet learned  to lisp his mother&rsquo;s name! And, while the hapless infant&rsquo;s family and friends  thronged about him snapping ineffective beaks, this feathered ghoul calmly,  callously, with almost unthinkable brutality, battered that helpless little  body against a fence-rail till it lay cold and still.</p>
<p>Then, ladies and gentlemen, before the very eyes of its anguished  parents, this soulless, bowelless villain&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>I am sorry, but tears will not permit me to continue. Also, in the  very face of these horrible charges, the prisoner, even now, begins to chuckle  in the dock.</p>
<p>Look at him, ladies and gentlemen! Listen to the heartless  scoundrel! Does that soulless sniggering suggest to you the possession of the  barest rudiments of decent pity, of remorse? Does it not, rather, indicate a  nature utterly depraved and hopelessly callous?</p>
<p>Look at him! He giggles! He guffaws! He&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Your Honour! I claim the protection of the court! I ask that this  brutal levity be sternly repressed! In view of&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Your Honour! Even the gentlemen at the Bar are now moved to infectious  mirth. Mirth? in the face of these ghastly accusation&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>Now the Press, the associate, the police are tittering! The  prisoner shrieks and shouts in unholy glee! Why, the very Bench itself is now  moved to unseemly hilarity!</p>
<p>I throw up my brief! I resign from this case!</p>

<p>Winter&nbsp;had come to frown a little while,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bluster from his skies of sodden grey,<br>
  Until bland Autumn, with a cheerful smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chased him into the dark hills far away;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning then to stay<br>
  Where singing birds the silver dawns beguile<br>
  And sunsets burn down an illumined aisle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day after golden day.</p>
<p>Now comes  a season of surprised delight.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alien trees, now loath to lose their leaves,<br>
  Strive yet to hold their yellow treasure tight.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shy swallows twitter by the sun-bathed eaves<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while sly Autumn thieves<br>
  Yet more of Winter&rsquo;s days, postpone their flight.<br>
  Birds hymn the day; but thro&rsquo; the windless night<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gloomy mopoke grieves.</p>
<p>Under the azure noon the forest sleeps<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugged by this sudden and unlooked-for balm.<br>
  Up from her lowly bed a primrose peeps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tempted too soon by hours of spring-like calm<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spilled from a lavish palm.<br>
  And now, from where the hill-stream laughs and leaps,<br>
  The thrush&rsquo;s evensong, as slow dusk creeps,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lifts like a grateful psalm. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now&nbsp;comes an end to quiet autumn days<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to frail loveliness. In the still night<br>
  Cold death has crept along the garden ways<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To wrap at last about each blossom bright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its funeral garment white.<br>
  And where a myriad cruel prisms blaze,<br>
  Ironically now the sun&rsquo;s kind rays<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shine but to blast and blight.</p>
<p>One hour of beauty on this shining morn&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White, mocking beauty while the frost rime clings.<br>
  Then bud and blossom, fashioned to adorn<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The earth, are but a heap of blackened things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All loveliness takes  wings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  And yet, not all! Still in a land forlorn,<br>
  Most valiantly by a glowing thorn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A grey thrush sweetly sings. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheCaseofLongJohnSilver"></a>The Case of Long John Silver</h2>
<p>We have&nbsp;always made it a matter of justice  that we should feed the magpies as well as the other and lowlier birds about  this little clearing in the forest.</p>
<p>We are meticulous about this, because we know that appearances are  often deceptive, and, although magpies generally, with their aggressive aspect  and fearless habit, seem well able to look after and fend for themselves, one  never knows what injustice may be done by making distinctions in one&rsquo;s charity  to the birds.</p>
<p>So we fed the magpies regularly, but they received little of our  sympathy until there came upon the scene one cold, autumn day, Long John Silver  and his mate, Limpy.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether fellow feeling had drawn these two strange  birds together, or whether they had been mates before disaster overtook them;  but the curious fact remained that they were each possessed of only one leg!</p>
<p>In each case, it was to be surmised, a barbarous rabbit-trap had  accounted for the other limb. John Silver&rsquo;s had been severed high up so that  nothing remained but a pathetic stump. His wife, Limpy, had lost little more  than a foot.</p>
<p>Of course, the sentimentalist of the household was roused to loud  wailings when she first beheld this pair of avian cripples, and I will admit  that they certainly did look forlorn&mdash;or else were putting up a rather good  bluff. It was hard to say which.</p>
<p>John Silver&rsquo;s method of approaching sustenance was especially  provoking of pity. On his one good leg he would hop rather painfully to within  striking distance of some proffered morsel of food; then he would sit down on  his stomach and, by some strange means that I have never been able to discover,  wriggle forward to the food.</p>
<p>Limpy was more spry on her remaining limb; nor did her brown eye  hold that piteous glance of appeal that came into John Silver&rsquo;s whenever he  chanced to catch the eye of the almoner.</p>
<p>Well, of course, special arrangements had to be made for these two  pensioners. They had, for instance, to have a separate feeding time when other,  and younger and stronger magpies, were not there to bully them.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of all precautions, brawls and piratical raids were  frequent, and frequently, too, a wild and angry squawking in the back paddock  brought us hurriedly out of doors to the rescue of our pair of invalids. Or  rather, that is what we thought at the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never be able to save them!&rdquo; said the sentimentalist.  &ldquo;Those hefty young ones will kill them eventually. The law of the wild is  atrociously cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was of much the same opinion and had foreseen for Silver and  Limpy a very brief remainder to their mortal span, until&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p>One morning I happened to be strolling through the rather dense  scrub that adjoins this clearing when I heard a wild hullabaloo that told of  magpies in dire distress&mdash;almost in mortal agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the end,&rdquo; thought I, &ldquo;of Silver and Limpy.&rdquo; And I crept  slowly through the scrub to see what I could see.</p>
<p>What I did see was this: John Silver, full of fight and fury, on  top of a hefty young bird who was yelling for mercy, while, a few yards away,  Limpy was dealing with another aggressor even more strenuously! Severed feet or  missing legs seemed to incommode them not in the least.</p>
<p>These indiscreet interlopers had raided Silver&rsquo;s private and  particular feeding grounds. They had to be dealt with. They were being dealt  with.</p>
<p>And then, whether it was that he was aware his hypocritical pose  had been discovered I do not know, but very shortly after that Long John Silver  and his mate disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it had to happen,&rdquo; wailed the sentimentalist. &ldquo;Those two  poor cripples have been brutally done to death by those ruthless younger birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wondered at the time if such were the case, though that look of  swaggering self-confidence I had seen in Long John&rsquo;s eye when last we met  caused me to doubt.</p>
<p>More than twelve months later I was talking to an old bush friend  who grew eloquent about his little crippled daughter&rsquo;s influence over the bush  birds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feeds right fair out of her hand they do,&rdquo; he assured me. &ldquo;Wrens  an&rsquo; robins an&rsquo; thrushes an&rsquo; the queerest pair of magpies you ever seen. Only  got two legs between them the pair of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for my Jenny feeding them the like she does, them two poor  mags wouldn&rsquo;t last a week. Keeps the young ones from tackling them, my Jenny  does. Real pretty to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then I knew that Long John Silver, with a low cunning worthy  of his namesake, had found a &ldquo;better &rsquo;ole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awful kind to birds an&rsquo; animals an&rsquo; things, my Jenny is,&rdquo;  continued the bushman. &ldquo;Runs in our family, that does. All of us likes treatin&rsquo;  dumb things gentle like. Ah well, I can&rsquo;t stand yappin&rsquo; all day,&rdquo; he concluded.  &ldquo;Got to get along home and kill a couple of pigs.&rdquo;</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, we wouldn&rsquo;t dare.<br>
  Behold our bland astonishment,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charge is quite absurd!<br>
  It must have been a parrot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or some other kind of bird.</p>
<p>It must  have been a satin bird;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must have been a crow.<br>
  It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be us;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are so meek, you know,<br>
  With our silver spectacles.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accusation&rsquo;s vile!<br>
  How can you deem us guilty<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we&rsquo;re whistling all the while?</p>
<p>Well, if you&rsquo;ve caught us in the act<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&rsquo;s no more to be said.<br>
  The plums are blue and succulent,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The strawberries are red.<br>
  And who&rsquo;d refuse a dainty dish<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When early autumn comes?<br>
  Oh, write a rhyme about us, man,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pay for all your plums. </p>

<p>In&nbsp;the quiet noonday heat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creeping high aloft<br>
  Nimbly, on prehensile feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling very soft;<br>
  Else, among the seeding grass,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Feeding by a tree<br>
  Where the soft cloud shadows pass<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not more silently.</p>
<p>Now, with  shrill and sudden din,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swift, as danger comes,<br>
  Flashing like a javelin<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the sunlit gums;<br>
  Rocketing thro&rsquo; inlaced limbs,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A living, darting flame;<br>
  While, above, the brown hawk skims<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avid for his game.</p>
<p>Forest  dweller, crimson clad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bright bird of the sun;<br>
  When the winter days grow sad<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seeds are done,<br>
  Where the lonely farm-house stands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cautiously come I<br>
  And about your harvest lands<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pause a while to spy.</p>
<p>Prove you kindly in the end.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply I shall stay;<br>
  And you have me for a friend<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; the winter day.<br>
  Toddling round the garden bed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swaggering thro&rsquo; the grass,<br>
  Lifting up a crimson head<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To watch you as you pass. </p>

<p>They&nbsp;count me but a common bird,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unworthy of respect,<br>
  Who see me chained, with mien absurd<br>
  Striving to croak some alien word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some strange dialect;<br>
  A captive robbed of freedom&rsquo;s right,<br>
  To be a clown for man&rsquo;s delight.</p>
<p>But  where, in blue skies, wild and free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My gleaming cohorts go,<br>
  Screaming in joyous ecstasy,<br>
  To settle on some withered tree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like sudden failing snow,<br>
  Or great white blossoms heaven sent&mdash;<br>
  Here am I in my element.</p>
<p>Come,  seek me then to be clown<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For man&rsquo;s divertisement!<br>
  For as the great flock settles down<br>
  To raid your fields by bush or town,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High is my sentry sent<br>
  To watch from out the topmost tree<br>
  With keen, unwinking scrutiny.</p>
<p>Now, let the smallest sign denote<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some threat of danger nigh,<br>
  And sudden, from a screaming throat<br>
  He sounds his warning trumpet note.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His golden crest held high,<br>
  And we are gone, like drifting snow,<br>
  Shrieking derision as we go. </p>

<p>I&nbsp;might&nbsp;charm you with my song,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you but forget my trade,<br>
  Where I pipe the autumn long<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some bowered wattle glade&mdash;<br>
  Pipe a rollicking refrain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such as Circe might not scorn,<br>
  Jovial amongst my slain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grimly dangling from the thorn.</p>
<p>Never yet  had siren sung<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a falser heart than mine,<br>
  Witness these grim trophies hung<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round me, while a cadence fine<br>
  Ripples on the balmy air<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the Fall&rsquo;s soft winds astir,<br>
  While anew I set my snare<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some feathered voyager.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a  note of careless glee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impish laughter in my lay;<br>
  Droll duets my mate with me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Improvises. We are gay<br>
  Lest the silence, were we dumb,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should betray the evil mind<br>
  Of hunter and of huntress come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring destruction to our kind.</p>
<p>Yet, tho&rsquo; grisly be my trade,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is man&rsquo;s consciense clear as mine,<br>
  Singing in my wattle glade<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I innocently dine?<br>
  And, when autumn comes again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haply you&rsquo;ll forget it all,<br>
  Lured anew by that refrain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the singing cannibal. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thro&rsquo; its shadows, green and cool,<br>
  Broadens to the quiet dreaming<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a little shady pool;<br>
  There an azure jewel burning<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O&rsquo;er the waters you may spy,<br>
  Never moving, never turning:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the river, from that hour<br>

<p>Men&nbsp;knew and loved my calling in old days&mdash;<br>
  Days ere a bitter wisdom taught me fear.<br>
  Trusting and unafraid, I went my ways<br>
  By many a crude hut of the pioneer;<br>

  By new-cleared farmland yet to know the plough;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calling by deep sled track and bullock  road&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>

  A tame, ignoble chase with me the prey&mdash;<br>

<p>Now&nbsp;golden days of autumn are no more.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down on the forest ruthless Winter frees&mdash;<br>
  First with far rumblings, waxing to a roar&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His shouting winds that riot thro&rsquo; the trees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raging like savage seas.<br>
  Bedraggled now the gown this garden wore;<br>
  Lost are those evanescent gems she bore;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lost, half the melodies.</p>
<p>A grey  thrush, every morn hops round the door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His wise head cocked inquiringly aslant;<br>
  Magpie and robin, these are shy no more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And every songster, as his fare grows scant,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Becomes a mendicant.<br>
  Small their demands upon the larder&rsquo;s store<br>
  On these dark, sodden days or mornings hoar,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cruel to bird and plant.</p>
<p>A strange  and ghostly silence came last night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the wind&rsquo;s wild clamour and the rain;<br>
  And now, at dawn, a coverlet of white<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swathes many a long, fantastic forest lane<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And unfamiliar plain.<br>
  Beneath the burden spar and sapling slight<br>
  Bow down, revealing many a vista bright<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this once green domain.</p>
<p>The silence shouts in this new, muffled world<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the tempest&rsquo;s nerve-destroying  din&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  Here, like three pixies, impudently curled<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a giant&rsquo;s pallet, sheets up to each chin,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three pert violas  grin&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  The forest is a lady richly pearled,<br>
  Else a white penitent in pure robes furled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And newly cleansed of sin. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="BirdlandontheDole"></a>Birdland on the Dole</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;weather-wise up here in the mountain  country amongst the big gums are talking of records. Even the oldest inhabitant  admits that &ldquo;he has never seen the likes before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirty-three frosts,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;since May the first, an&rsquo; fourteen  of &rsquo;em without a break. If that ain&rsquo;t a record, I&rsquo;ll go &lsquo;he&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my own experience of over twenty years here, I have never  before known more than five consecutive nights of frost. Three frosts and then  a rain is the general average in a normal winter in this part of the forest.</p>
<p>The sunlit days are ideally beautiful&mdash;tragically beautiful when  one remembers the conditions in drier areas.</p>
<p>But it is the birds who seem to be having the worst time of it  here. For them, glorious days fail to compensate for the grub shortage. I don&rsquo;t  know what has happened to the grubs and worms and other dainties of the avian  menu, but they have become suddenly scarce; either perishing in frosty nights  or digging deeper in earth in search of warmth.</p>
<p>The birds are equally nonplussed and are rapidly becoming  mendicants&mdash;diffident at first but, with the discovery that free food is to be  had for the asking, gradually assertive and at times positively imperative.</p>
<p>A rather confident grey thrush began the daily procession to the  door. He (or she) was the first to be offered a morsel in the way of charity  one morning when he had given up foraging and sat disconsolate by the door.</p>
<p>He came again and was fed. Within a very few days he began to look  upon the daily dole as his unquestionable right.</p>
<p>At precisely nine o&rsquo;clock every morning after frost he comes to  the branches of a Japanese plum-tree and whistles once&mdash;a loud, musical note  that permits of only one interpretation: &ldquo;Here I am. Where&rsquo;s my breakfast?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Should the almoner be late, the calls become louder and more  frequent, and further delay leads to an outcry that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>A handful of varied scraps is scattered on the lawn and he dives  immediately and breakfasts unafraid, fully aware that he enjoys the privilege  and protection of a favourite.</p>
<p>His departure, replete and musically grateful, is the signal for  the general descent, First the currawongs, whose shrewd, white eyes have been  watching from adjacent gums, secure their provender on the cash-and-carry  system, since they know that, because of their greed, they may not linger.</p>
<p>And then come the more diffident satin birds who also carry away  and eat their food in private, but as a matter of preference and good manners.</p>
<p>The magpies, those proud and arrogant birds, refuse to eat with  the rabble, and insist upon a separate mealtime at another hour of the day.</p>
<p>But, with the disappearance of the larger birds, the small fry  come clamouring for their share, for all have been watching and waiting in the  bushes round about.</p>
<p>First of these the impertinent yellow robins who have long since  learned that to perch cheekily upon a forefinger insures one a full and  uninterrupted meal while others catch as catch can in the general scramble.  Blue wrens hop about the banquets&rsquo; edge; scrub wrens, chats and tits watch  their chance to snatch a morsel, and so, until the last small songster has been  satisfied.</p>
<p>Then all go about their own lawful occasions, and no bird begs  about the door for the rest of that day.</p>
<p>For there is this to be said of the birds: As soon as the frozen  earth is in fit state for foraging they prefer to stick to the job, however ill  repaid in grubs and other delicacies. After only one frostless night they  prefer work to free sustenance, excepting only that aggressively mendicant grey  thrush, who seems to have entirely lost his self respect and become determined  to loaf on the government for the rest of his feathered life.</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheTree"></a>The Tree</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;planted&nbsp;here, today, a strong young tree.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rich soil it has, and sun, and space to grow;<br>
  And who, I wonder, in the years to be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will seek its boughs&rsquo; soft shade; for well I know<br>
  Long ere this slender plant grows full and round<br>
  He who now tends it shall be sleeping sound.</p>
<p>What  manner of a man will sit to view<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This now familiar scene when those shades spread?<br>
  Will he be thankful that he never knew<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These days of strange, uncomprehended dread?<br>
  Or will he, gazing back, find cause to sigh<br>
  For olden peace, for happier days gone by?</p>
<p>I planted here, to-day, a strong young hope<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, when this tree&rsquo;s green banners be unfurled,<br>
  There shall come singing down this verdant slope<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some wiser mortal of a wiser world.<br>
  And if he bless the man who set the tree,<br>
  And be content, so, mayhap, shall I be. </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="TheBestingofBombastes"></a>The Besting of Bombastes</h2>
<p>On&nbsp;the day that he brought himself  first (and very confidently) under our notice we named him &ldquo;Bombastes Furioso,&rdquo;  without hesitation, for it seemed to us that no other could suit him one half  so well; because all the fury and bombast that might reasonably inhabit any  single living being, of any size, seemed to be concentrated in that absurd  little ball of fuss and flesh and feathers. So ridiculously small was he that  the whole of him might gone comfortably into an egg-cup and still left room on  top.</p>
<p>All male blue wrens are perkily vain and self-important little  braggarts; and Bombastes was the wren of wrens. His comical tail was cocked at  a cheekier angle, his cap and cape were of a richer, shinier blue, his song was  not so much a song as an arrogant yell of blustering defiance&mdash;a truculent bravo  of a wren, a swaggering, ruffling blade of a wren who bowed to no law and flung  vainglorious challenge to the whole avian universe. &ldquo;Bring out your goshawks!  Bring out your kestrels and your wedge-tail eagles! Keep close to me, ladies,  and you shall come to no harm. I am Bombaste!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, this Bombastes was a wren not to be overlooked or  carelessly ignored even by stolid humans, nor could he be easily mistaken for  any other cock-wren of like habit and hue. His every extravagant quality  convinced us that he was a new-comer and a stranger among the other blue wrens  about the garden. He probably came from somewhere in the back bush where (as it  is more than likely he told some of his new lady friends) wrens were wrens and  huge snakes ate whole families for breakfast. But he had not left because of  that. What! He, who had himself slain a great tiger snake single-handed and  whose way with a native cat or a falcon was sudden and terrible. He had come  away because he was none of your home-staying, prosaic, wormhoarding blobs of  wrens who stuck to the old home town and played safe among the friends of his  youth. No fear! He for foreign fields and high adventure. He to carve out a  deathless name for himself in the rough and tumble of the great wide world. And  any gentleman present chose to doubt his word in any least little detail&mdash;well,  just let it be whispered, just whispered. For he was Bombastes and, believe  him, he was tough!</p>
<p>Nor did he confine his activity to mere boastful threat and dark  innuendo. Before the week was through he had fought and vanquished every one of  the score or so of cock-wrens whose familiar home was the garden. So that he  became the ideal and the hero of every demure little lady hopping daintily  about the lawn, and the swaggering overlord of the lowly world of lesser birds  who worked out their own absorbing problems of life&mdash;of loves and hates and  smouldering jealousies&mdash;all down among the daisies and the buttercups, the  pansies and eschscholtzias; for spring was at its flood in an exulting world of  bursting bloom when the sap is up and blood runs hot.</p>
<p>And then, at the very zenith of his triumph, in the full prime of  his lusty young wrenhood, his obsession took him; and so began the decline and  fall of the great little Bombastes.</p>
<p>I cannot help feeling that there is a moral lesson somewhere about  this story. If there is, I leave you to discover it yourself. Like every erring  brother who has escaped being an active pharisee, I dread moral lessons. Too  often and too aptly they come home to roost.</p>
<p>Our house in the forest is a house of many windows; for, in the  murk of forest winters, light becomes a precious thing eagerly desired. But our  windows are often the scene and the cause of many a swift tragedy, sometimes  with fatal results; for birds great and small, who are fresh from the bush and  unused to human habitations, seem unable at first to detect clear glass; so  that, while still in full and carefree flight, a sudden and mysterious collision  with the invisible leaves, if not a corpse, a very sorry and bewildered bird.</p>
<p>But, bush-born and unsophisticated though he was, a mere house  held no terrors for the valiant Bombastes&mdash;until the day he discovered in one of  the windows of the dining-room, not a mysterious accident, but some uncanny  quality that was to a bird of his spirit at once a challenge and a maddening  exasperation. For within that hole in the wall there lurked a rival still  unconquered: a brutal looking, vainglorious swaggerer, a truculent bully of a  blue wren, But Bombastes was not to be bluffed by any boastful posturing, so he  dashed madly into battle.</p>
<p>When he recovered he explained to his lady friends that he seemed  to have bumped into an unaccountable barrier of solid air: something hitherto  outside his experience entirely. Privily he decided that the ill-favoured  braggart inside the window wore invisible, enchanted armour of some  description&mdash;a dirty, underhand trick, sure enough. But even that was not going  to bluff the unbeaten holder of the blue-wren belt; so he stropped his bill and  spat on his hands, so to speak, and came at it again; but less confidently,  more cautiously this time. But, again and again that mysterious, unseen barrier  thwarted his every effort.</p>
<p>Then he abandoned the direct attack and experimented with  strategy. He would sneak furtively around the edge of the window-frame and  surprise the enemy with a sudden rush. But, astonishingly, his rival seemed to  sense the move and adopted exactly similar tactics at the same moment. It was  all very puzzling.</p>
<p>We allowed him to keep at it for twenty minutes or so and then, in  kindness hunted him from the window. He seemed to resent our interference, and  went reluctantly, only to discover almost immediately another and exactly  similar enemy in the next window. We chased him from there, and, half an hour  later, found him at another side of the house trying to get at yet another  impregnable foe.</p>
<p>Short of putting someone on sentry to go around the house all day  long, there seemed to be no means of saving Bombastes from his own folly. In a  day or two he had made the alarming discovery that he, Bombastes the invincible  (or so he had imagined) was surrounded by aggressive and mysterious enemies,  who would not be subdued. At the end of a week the thing had become an  obsession. But by now much of the former dash and exultant pride had gone out  of his attack; he fought doggedly but without spirit, sparing an absurdly brief  portion of the daylight hours in the quest of sustenance.</p>
<p>Before the end of another week, I greatly fear that his already  tottering reason fell completely off its perch, for he began suddenly to fight  with all the insane fury of a bird possessed.</p>
<p>By now every vestige of his jaunty, cocksure air had gone. His  once proud tail had fallen almost to the horizontal, his wings drooped, and he  breathed through open bill, pantingly.</p>
<p>But since every single one of his myriad rivals exhibited  precisely similar signs of acute distress, he was encouraged to rally his  failing strength and, hopeful to the end, he fought stubbornly on and on. He  was a game bird, that Bombastes, I will say that for him.</p>
<p>Just before the end he must have become utterly maniacal. The moon  was at its full and, in the dead of night, we used to hear Bombastes the Balmy  dashing his poor little body furiously against the pane where the background of  some darkened room made its glass doubly reflective.</p>
<p>We found him one morning below a window of the study, a pathetic  little bundle of brown and brilliant sapphire, a ruby drop of blood coming from  the base of his bill telling how the end had come.</p>
<p>I think it is about here somewhere that the moral lesson should he  worked in. Something about the fear complex or the sex urge to male conflict.  Something fashionably Freudian or else essentially Jungish. Fortunately I  forget which.</p>
<p>But those who would discover a homily in this splendid saga in  miniature of the ill-starred Bombastes I advise to conjure a picture of that  little scrap of coloured feathers which, with all its flesh and fuss could have  gone comfortably into an egg-cup and still left room on top&mdash;that deserted  casket, absurdly small, yet once holding an amazingly complex collection of  pride and passion, of strange fears and unyielding fury, now prone upon the lawn  among the fearless daisies.</p>
<p>We buried the little hero beneath a viola, blue as his own  sapphire crown. And all his recent lady friends, with rehabilitated gentlemen  in attendance, gathered around to search daintily for little worms amongst the  grave clods.</p>

  Cock o&rsquo; the walk&mdash;no questing hawk,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud eagle, crow nor thrush<br>
  Stays to defy my battle-cry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My pinions&rsquo; whistling rush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CalLOG&rsquo;allay-oo!&rdquo; When day is new<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I fill the scented morn<br>
  With a joyful song, loud, sweet and long&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My echoing, hunting horn.<br>
  &ldquo;Calloo, callay!&rdquo; I greet the day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throned on a tree-top high.<br>
  In my domain I rule, I reign,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cock o&rsquo; the walk am I! </p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="PromiseofSpring"></a>Promise of Spring</h2>
<p>Spring&nbsp;surely must be near. High overhead<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kind blue heavens bend to timbers tall;<br>
  And here, this morning, is the picture spread<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I have learned to love the best of all.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear flame robin call<br>
  His early love-song. Winter&rsquo;s might is sped;<br>
  And young crowns now begin to fleck with red<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This great green, living wall.</p>
<p>Picture of promise, that I count the best<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of many a fair familiar bushland scene;<br>
  Lifting o&rsquo;er all, the far mount&rsquo;s sunlit crest<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks down where silver wattles lightly screen<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blue smoke, that peeps between<br>
  Their tall tops, from some settler&rsquo;s hidden nest&mdash;<br>
  Looks down on golden wattles closely pressed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To blackwood&rsquo;s luscious green.</p>
<p>Before the dovecote, mirrored in the pond,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A veil diaphanous of drifting mist<br>
  Makes many a nimbus for great gums beyond<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose gaunt, grey limbs a mounting sun has kissed<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To palest amethyst.<br>
  Now, stepping very daintily, with fond,<br>
  Soft cooings, fantails on the lawn respond,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Spring, the amorist.</p>
<p>Above the pool the swallows drift and dip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And circle on, to trail bright crystal showers.<br>
  Blue wren and peewit dance about its lip,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pausing a while to test their choral powers.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, a hint of flowers<br>
  Peeps forth, where lupins, in close fellowship<br>
  With musk and maple, risk a tender tip<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In quest of sunlit hours.</p>
<p>From the deep forest, on the clean crisp air,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bushman&rsquo;s axe-blows echo sharply clear;<br>
  A soft cloud&rsquo;s tattered fleece drifts idly where<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glows azure hope. Impatient to appear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Springs now full many a spear<br>
  Of marching daffodils. Shorn of cold care.<br>
  The joyous bush birds vie with flutings rare.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring surely must be near.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheQuietHour"></a>The Quiet Hour</h2>
<p>I&nbsp;have&nbsp;found in this Australian scene, of  mountain and forest, of shaded creek and fern-filled gully, of cultivated  gardens bordered by the virgin bush, much quiet peace and many joys&mdash;on rare  occasions, inexpressible joys, far removed from the dark moods awakened by  those pictures of arid desolation that have engaged too closely and too often  the minds of those who would recreate with words the life and scenes and moods  of this versatile continent.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Dead Heart,&rdquo; the dusty track through waterless deserts, the  hopeless struggles of the outback settler&mdash;all these have, I think, been more than  a little over-stressed. There are many pleasant places up and down this land  where nature has been less unkind.</p>
<p>In such a pleasant place I have lived and worked for nearly thirty  years; and, if I have succeeded in conveying to readers something of the joys  and (for the sake of truth) of the rare tragedies of this forest place, then  the whole of my task has been done, for I set out to do no more than that.</p>
<p>As I write these lines, seated upon a green lawn with the scene  before me, the evening of what has been a glorious sunny day begins to steal  about the forest.</p>
<p>The rigours of winter have almost passed; the coming of spring  (which none can appreciate so well as dwellers in this mountain place of deep  forests dank with too abundant rain) is indicated by a thousand hopeful signs.  Daffodil and rhododendron are aglow in the garden, lawns have taken on a yet  more vivid green, and the foliage of golden wattle that rich hue soon to be  intensified by the already bursting bloom. Long since, the birds began their early  mating songs.</p>
<p>To this valley twilight has come; but the sinking sun, casting his  last rays high over it, tinges with an amethyst glow the clustering tree-trunks  of a towering eastern hill.</p>
<p>Two grey thrushes already have called for the customary bedtime  snack and, having supped, neither has failed to pipe a little song in  gratitude&mdash;or so it pleases us to think.</p>
<p>An impertinent blue wren, perched on a rose spurt close by my  head, inspects me with an air of comic impudence, then lifts up his head to a  refrain that, in such a mite, seems absurdly vociferous. Then he, too, flutters  off with his brown-clad family to some secret abode in the denser scrubs. From  his perch on a high gable a kookaburra chuckles rather drowsily and cocks a  shrewd eye earthward.</p>
<p>As the gloaming deepens, there descends upon this scene a mantle  of peace so profound that it is past explaining&mdash;a feeling of content so deep,  of such calm and unquestioning acceptance of all things, that it seems to hold  some quality of mystery that &rsquo;twould be folly to explore. Out of the brooding  forest, the darkening sky, the last goings and comings of birds, the little  whispered calls and secret songs and rustlings, there steals to one a sense of  infinite well-being, definite and real enough while the mind accepts it without  question; yet so impalpable as to vanish utterly the moment it becomes a  problem for curious enquiry.</p>
<p>In his book, <i>The Nature of a  Bird&rsquo;s World</i>, the English writer, H. Eliot Howard says in the preface,  &ldquo;There is more joy in finding a problem than in trying to solve one, for to  solve a problem is vain delusion. There is a mystery of song, a mystery of  flight, a mystery of nest; and yet, not three mysteries but one: a bird is the  mystery, for it steals our values of beauty and mingles them strangely in form  no less than in feathers; in colour no less than in song; and in what we value  most, devotion to its home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That, I feel, in some vague and general way, defines my attitude  towards our birds&mdash;if ever I trouble to conceive an attitude at all&mdash;and, indeed,  towards all nature in this Singing Garden green-walled by towering trees that  hold a mystery all their own.</p>
<p>It is darkening rapidly now; the kookaburra is still perched upon  the high gable, though I can discern little more than his silhouette. As I  watch he becomes suddenly alert and, diving straight as an arrow for a spot on  the lawn not three feet from my chair, swiftly, with perfect confidence,  plunges his great bill into the earth and unerringly draws forth a fine fat  worm. He calmly batters it twice against a rung of the chair, gobbles it, turns  about awkwardly on clumsy feet and, before he has flown thirty yards, darkness  conceals him.</p>
<p>Here is yet another mystery. How in that half-darkness, from sixty  feet away or more, did that kookaburra know with such unerring certitude that  the worm was exactly at that spot and so easily accessible? Is he possessed of  vision so unbelievably keen that, from that distance and in such feeble light,  he detected some infinitesimal earth movement that betrayed the worm? Did the  unlucky worm betray itself by a sound-vibration too minutely high in frequency  for human ears? Or again, has the kookaburra some sixth sense that we lords of  earth are unable to discover or to comprehend?</p>
<p>And, last question of all: is it vastly important that I or any  other human should know?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Dusk"></a>Dusk</h2>
<p>Now&nbsp;is the healing, quiet hour that fills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This gay, green world with peace and grateful rest.<br>
  Where lately over opalescent hills<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood of slain Day reddened all the west,<br>
  Now comes at Night&rsquo;s behest,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A glow that over all the forest spills,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with the gold of promised daffodils.<br>
  Of all hours this is best.</p>
<p>It is the  time for thoughts of holy things,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of half-forgotten friends and one&rsquo;s own folk.<br>
  O&rsquo;er all, the garden-scented sweetness clings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To mingle with the wood fire&rsquo;s drifting smoke.<br>
  A bull-frog&rsquo;s startled croak<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds from the gully where the last bird sings<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His laggard vesper hymn, with folded wings;<br>
  And Night spreads forth her cloak.</p>
<p>Keeping their vigil where the great range yearns,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like rigid sentries stand the wise old gums.<br>
  On blundering wings a night-moth wheels and turns<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lumbers on, mingling its drowsy hums<br>
  With that far roll of drums,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the swift creek goes tumbling midst the ferns&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as the first star in the zenith burns,<br>
The dear, soft darkness comes.</p>
