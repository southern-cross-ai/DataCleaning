<h2 align="center"><a name="RoaminFree"></a>Roamin&rsquo; Free </h2>
<p>The miser sits beside his hoard,<br>
  The lover tarries by his bride,<br>
  And he who neither may afford<br>
  Is free to roam the whole world wide.<br>
  Ye prate of cares, of plans amiss,<br>
  With voices grave and faces long;<br>
  While I &mdash; I ask of life but this:<br>
  To drink, to kiss, to troll a song &mdash;</p>
<p>And rove a-roamin&rsquo;, roamin&rsquo; free &mdash;<br>
  A-ringin&rsquo; in the changes.<br>
  Why linger here to waste a tear<br>
  When joy awaits o&rsquo;er the ranges?<br>
  Why tarry there to nurse a care<br>
  When golden days are over?<br>
  For far and wide, where e&rsquo;er men abide,<br>
  There&rsquo;s welcome for the rover.</p>
<p>Who seeks to earn a life of ease:<br>
  For honor, wealth, and fame exist;<br>
  Then, growing old, and having these,<br>
  To sit and think of what he&rsquo;s missed?<br>
  I live for love of life alone;<br>
  You live in wait for fortune&rsquo;s smile &mdash;<br>
  Quote proverbs at a rolling stone,<br>
  And gather moss and trouble while &mdash;</p>
<p>I rove a-roamin&rsquo;, roamin&rsquo;free &mdash;<br>
  A-ringin&rsquo; in the changes.<br>
  If there&rsquo;s no moss this side for me<br>
  There&rsquo;s heaps across the ranges.<br>
  So have your say and slave away,<br>
  And set a store by small things;<br>
  Ye may be lords of hard-earned hoards,<br>
  But I&rsquo;m the lord of all things.</p>
<p>Am I a constant lover? Nay:<br>
  Love, bounded, cloys, and bright eyes fade;<br>
  And he who loves and rides away<br>
  Rides on to meet a fairer maid.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis sure, I&rsquo;d find, if wed to Nell,<br>
  &rsquo;Twas Jess or Lil I loved the best.<br>
  My faith! I love them all too well<br>
  To choose the one and lose the rest.</p>
<p>And I live a-lovin&rsquo;, lovin&rsquo; free &mdash;<br>
  A-ringin&rsquo; in the changes.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis: &ldquo;Kiss me Nell, and now farewell.&rdquo;<br>
  (Jess waits across the ranges).<br>
  And this, I boast, the rover&rsquo;s toast<br>
  You&rsquo;ll find the wide world over:<br>
  &ldquo;From names refrain, and tankards drain<br>
  To the lass that loves a rover.&rdquo;</p>

<p>We were cartin&rsquo; lathes and palin&rsquo;s from the slopes of Mount St. Leonard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With our axles near the road-bed and the mud as stiff as glue;<br>
  And our bullocks weren&rsquo;t precisely what you&rsquo;d call conditioned nicely,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And meself and Messmate Mitchell had our doubts of gettin&rsquo; through.</p>
<p>It had rained a tidy skyful in the week before we started,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But our tucker-bag depended on the sellin&rsquo; of our load;<br>
  So we punched &rsquo;em on by inches, liftin&rsquo; &rsquo;em across the pinches,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till we struck the final section of the worst part of the road.</p>
<p>We were just congratulatin&rsquo; one another on the goin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we blundered in a pot-hole right within the sight of goal,<br>
  Where the bush-track joins the metal. Mitchell, as he saw her settle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justified his reputation at the peril of his soul.</p>
<p>We were in a glue-pot, certain&mdash;red and stiff and most tenacious;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over naves and over axles&mdash;waggon sittin&rsquo; on the road.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Struth,&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll never lift her. Take a shot from Hell to shift her.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothin&rsquo; left us but unyoke &rsquo;em and sling off the blessed load.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, beside our scene of trouble stood a little one-roomed humpy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home of an enfeebled party by the name of Dad McGee.<br>
  Daddy was, I pause to mention, livin&rsquo; on an old-age pension<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since he gave up bullock-punchin&rsquo; at the age of eighty-three.</p>
<p>Startled by our exclamations, Daddy hobbled from the shanty,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gazin&rsquo; where the stranded waggon looked like some half-foundered ship.<br>
  When the state o&rsquo; things he spotted, &ldquo;Looks,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;like you was potted,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he toddles up to Mitchell. &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;gimme that whip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well! I&rsquo;ve heard of transformations; heard of fellers sort of changin&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the face of sudden danger or some great emergency;<br>
  Heard the like in song and story and in bush traditions hoary,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I nearly dropped me bundle as I looked at Dad McGee.</p>
<p>While we gazed he seemed to toughen; as his fingers gripped the handle<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His old form grew straight and supple, and a light leapt in his eye;<br>
  And he stepped around the waggon, not with footsteps weak and laggin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with firm, determined bearin&rsquo;, as he flung the whip on high.</p>
<p>Now he swung the leaders over, while the whip-lash snarled and volleyed;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they answered like one bullock, strainin&rsquo; to each crack and clout;<br>
  But he kept his cursin&rsquo; under till old Brindle made a blunder;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I thought all Hell had hit me, and the master opened out.</p>
<p>And the language! Oh, the language! Seemed to me I must be dreamin&rsquo;;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the wondrous words and phrases only genius could produce<br>
  Roared and rumbled, fast and faster, in the throat of that Old Master&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oaths and curses tipped with lightning, cracklin&rsquo; flames of fierce abuse.</p>
<p>Then we knew the man before us was a Master of our callin&rsquo;;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of those great lords of language gone for ever from Out-back;<br>
  Heroes of an ancient order; men who punched across the border;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanished giants of the sixties; puncher-princes of the track.</p>
<p>Now we heard the timbers strainin&rsquo;, heard the waggon&rsquo;s loud complainin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the master cried triumphant, as he swung &rsquo;em into line,<br>
  As they put their shoulders to it, lifted her, and pulled her through it:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way we useter do it in the days o&rsquo; sixty-nine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the foot of Mount St. Leonard lives an old, enfeebled party<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who retired from bullock-punchin&rsquo; at the age of eighty-three.<br>
  If you seek him folk will mention, merely, that he draws the pension;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to us he looms a Master&mdash;Prince of Punchers, Dad McGee!</p>

<p>Jim Johnson is a farmin&rsquo; man &mdash; he is a farmin&rsquo; man &mdash;<br>
  And all year round the skin peels off his nose,<br>
  For up that way, I&rsquo;ve heard them say, the sun is wont to tan<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The farmin&rsquo; man.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And oh, to see his clothes!<br>
  He wears the strangest cast-ir&rsquo;n lookin&rsquo; clothes.</p>
<p>For when he&rsquo;s dressed up in his best &mdash; that is his very best &mdash;<br>
  Jim Johnson is the weirdest sight to see.<br>
  You&rsquo;d be inclined to call to mind, when you beheld his vest,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And &mdash; er &mdash; the rest,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The local founderee &mdash;<br>
  A casting from the local founderee.</p>
<p>Now, do not think me rude; I&rsquo;m not. &nbsp;I certainly am not;<br>
  For Jim was honest, tho&rsquo; his style amused;<br>
  Aye, as the sun, or any one; and sometimes just as hot &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; That&rsquo;s when he got<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Excited or confused.<br>
  And he was most pathetic when confused.</p>
<p>Well, just to cut the story short &mdash; (I&rsquo;m sure you like it short) &mdash;<br>
  Jim Johnson recently said to his wife,<br>
  He thought he&rsquo;d go and see the Show. &nbsp;He said he really ought<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He ought, he thought,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just one time in his life.<br>
  He said he&rsquo;d like to just for once in his life.</p>
<p>And so she brushed his Berlin  suit &mdash; his cast-ir&rsquo;n Sunday suit &mdash;<br>
  And Jimmy brushed his whiskers various ways;<br>
  Then got his nag and carpet bag, and after some dispute,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Got on the brute,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And faced the city maze &mdash;<br>
  Went, via railway station, to the maze.</p>
<p>Now, Jimmy knew a thing or two &mdash; a thing or two he knew :<br>
  In fact, he wasn&rsquo;t quite the jay he seemed;<br>
  For he had heard a warning word &mdash; a friendly word or two<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; About the crew<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of spieling men who schemed &mdash;<br>
  Of how to rob poor farming men they schemed.</p>
<p>So, thinkin&rsquo; hard, he kept his guard &mdash; kept closely on his guard.<br>
  No purse-trick person had a chance with him.<br>
  He sort of thought he didn&rsquo;t ought to have his pleasure marred<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In this regard,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Considered cunnin&rsquo; Jim.<br>
  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll floor &rsquo;em if they tackle me,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>He viewed the city Show with glee &mdash; with most abounding glee.<br>
  The pigs and cattle interested him;<br>
  And there he ran against a man who strangely seemed to be<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Excessively<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Delighted to see Jim,<br>
  Tho&rsquo; Jim could not remember knowin&rsquo; him.</p>
<p>The stranger was extremely free &mdash; familiarly free;<br>
  In fact, he was most intimate indeed.<br>
  He had, he told, an uncle old, and then explained that he<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Was in Fiji;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But he did not proceed.<br>
  He was too bruised and battered to proceed.</p>
<p>For Jim &mdash; well, you will understand &mdash; I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll understand;<br>
  &ldquo;Revoltin&rsquo; details best not written down.&rdquo;<br>
  Jim gave him fits, then wiped the bits of stranger off his hand &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; His hairy hand -<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And strolled around the town &mdash;<br>
  Went out the gates to stroll around the town.</p>
<p>And it was there he met the gal &mdash; a very pretty gal;<br>
  But whether he met her or she met him<br>
  Up to this day he cannot say. &ldquo;Please, for the Hospi-tal.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This said the gal;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then she smiled at Jim.<br>
  The damsel sweetly smiled. &nbsp;That finished Jim.</p>
<p>And such a charming girl was she &mdash; a perfect peach was she.<br>
  The sort that sort of takes your breath away &mdash;<br>
  Your breath and things &mdash; small offerings. &nbsp;Her sphere appeared to be<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Society.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, say, her smile was gay;<br>
  Her smile was most embarrassing and gay.</p>
<p>He blushed behind his whiskers, and &mdash; his&nbsp;<i>bushy</i>&nbsp;whiskers  &mdash; and<br>
  Remarked &mdash; well, he ain&rsquo;t quite sure what he said,<br>
  Altho&rsquo;, poor bloke, he must have spoke; for you will understand<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He was unmanned<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And queer about the head.<br>
  Nice girls, they always queered him in the head.</p>
<p>She wanted money for a cause &mdash; a most deserving cause;<br>
  At least, I&rsquo;ve gathered facts to that extent.<br>
  And in his pockets Jim he socks his large and hairy paws,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And then withdraws,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And gives her ev&rsquo;ry cent &mdash;<br>
  Except his railway ticket &mdash; ev&rsquo;ry cent.</p>
<p>Of course, there&rsquo;s no excuse for Jim &mdash; I ain&rsquo;t excusin&rsquo; Jim;<br>
  But picture if you think there&rsquo;s cause for blame &mdash;<br>
  A charming imp, and him all limp. &nbsp;Supposing you were him &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you were Jim &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I think you&rsquo;d do the same.<br>
  You would if you had whiskers just the same.</p>
<p>And afterwards, when Jim he fled &mdash; back to his home he fled &mdash;<br>
  (I think I told you he was on the land) &mdash;<br>
  His missus she, well &mdash; seems to me that &mdash; anyhow, &ldquo;Nuff sed&rdquo; &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The past is dead.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll understand &mdash;<br>
  You&rsquo;ll surely have the sense to understand.</p>

<p>Hawkins&nbsp;wasn&rsquo;t in the swim at all in Dingo Flat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to bait him was our chiefest form of bliss;<br>
  But, in justice, be it said that he had a business head.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m standing here and telling this.)</p>
<p>He was trav&rsquo;ling for a company, insuring people&rsquo;s lives;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stayed about a month in Dingo Flat;<br>
  But his biz was rather dull, and we took him for a gull,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An amazing simple-minded one at that.</p>
<p>He was mad, he was, on mining and around about the town<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prospected every reef. But worse than that&mdash;<br>
  He&rsquo;d talk for half a day, in a most annoying way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On &ldquo;The mineral resources of the Flat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swore that somewhere nigh us was a rich gold-bearing reef,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a fellow only had the luck to strike it;<br>
  And he only used to laugh when the boys began to chaff,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seemed, in fact, to rather sort of like it.</p>
<p>Well, we stood him for a month until he wellnigh drove us mad.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as jeering couldn&rsquo;t penetrate his hide<br>
  We fixed a little scheme for to dissipate his dream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sicken him of mining till he died.</p>
<p>We got a likely-looking bit of quartz and faked it up<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With dabs of golden paint; then called him in.<br>
  Oh, he went clean off his head; it was gold for sure, he said.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if we&rsquo;d sell our claim he&rsquo;d raise the tin.</p>
<p>But we weren&rsquo;t taking any&mdash;not at least till later on;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For we reckoned that we&rsquo;d string him on a while.<br>
  When he wanted information of the reef&rsquo;s exact location<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would meet him with a knowing sort of smile.</p>
<p>At last we dropped a hint that set him pegging out a claim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we saw that we were coming in for sport;<br>
  For the next account we heard was when Hawkins passed the word<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fetching up an expert to report.</p>
<p>When we heard that expert&rsquo;s verdict we were blown clean out of time,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And absorbed the fact that we had fallen in.<br>
  The gold, he said, would run &rsquo;bout four ounces to the ton;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With traces, too, of copper, zinc and tin.</p>
<p>Old Hawkins he was jubilant, and up at Peter&rsquo;s store<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lovely lot of specimens was showing;<br>
  And we gazed at them and groaned, for the truth had to be owned:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had put him on a pile without our knowing.</p>
<p>We couldn&rsquo;t let the thing slip through our fingers, so to speak.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were thousands in the mine without a doubt.<br>
  So me and Baker Brothers, and half a dozen others,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We formed a syndicate to buy him out.</p>
<p>Well, he said he&rsquo;d not the money to develop such a claim,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;d sell it if we made a decent bid.<br>
  So we made pretence at dealing, and it almost seemed like stealing<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he parted, for five hundred lovely quid.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>We haven&rsquo;t seen the vendor in the Flat for nigh a week,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we&rsquo;re wishing, on the whole, he&rsquo;d never come.<br>
  The confounded mine&rsquo;s a duffer; for that simple-minded buffer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had salted it. The &ldquo;expert&rdquo; was a chum.</p>
<p>Hawkins wasn&rsquo;t reckoned much at all in Dingo Flat.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;d a notion that his headpiece was amiss.<br>
  But we wish to have it stated, he was rather underrated.<br>

<p>What&rsquo;s the odds? It&rsquo;s got to happen. What we&rsquo;ve done we&rsquo;ll do again;<br>
  And we know it while we make &rsquo;em, resolutions are in vain.<br>
  Life&rsquo;s a weary track to travel, mostly full of ruts and stumps:<br>
  Them that spends their days in drudging have to take their joy in lumps.<br>
  Yoke &rsquo;em up an&rsquo; get a move on! Gayest times must have an end,<br>
  There&rsquo;s a weary track to travel when we&rsquo;ve nothing left to spend.<br>
  If there&rsquo;s still a bob we&rsquo;ll wet it, and a last glad joke we&rsquo;ll crack,<br>
  Time enough for vain regretting when we&rsquo;re on the Homeward Track.</p>

<p>Reginald Alphonsus Bungey had a scientific mind.<br>
  From his early childhood was he taxidermic&rsquo;ly inclined.<br>
  Birds and beasts of many species gathered he from far and wide &mdash;<br>
  Crawlywigs and crows and spiders &mdash; goodness knows what else beside.</p>
<p>Reggie stuffed, preserved and mounted, beetles, butterflies, and  bees;<br>
  Guinea pigs and great &ldquo;goanners,&rdquo; fishes, finches, frogs and fleas.<br>
  He would roam by stream and scrubland with his rod and gun and net,<br>
  Stalking, killing, skinning, stuffing, every creature he could get,<br>
  In the noble cause of science &mdash; tho&rsquo; his heart was far from hard &mdash;<br>
  Transfixed he poor dumb cockroaches, thro&rsquo; the vitals, to a card.</p>
<p>Dawned at last the day when Reggie, specimens of all near home<br>
  Had within his vast collection. Then did he resolve to roam<br>
  Far afield; for stranger creatures &mdash; painted parrot, grov&rsquo;ling grub &mdash;<br>
  Where the sportive bunyip gambols, in the distant Wild Dog Scrub.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Wayback William was reflective, as he trudged along the track,<br>
  With his blackened billy swinging and his swag upon his back.<br>
  He was thinking deeply, sadly, man was prone to actions rash,<br>
  And deplored the tantalizing slippiness of hard-earned cash.<br>
  Suddenly, with exclamations that I&rsquo;d rather not repeat,<br>
  William stopped, and, with a clatter, dropped his billy at his feet.<br>
  &ldquo;Spare me days!&rdquo; said he, with other exclamations I&rsquo;ll omit.<br>
  &ldquo;Is this &rsquo;ere a man afore me? Or &rsquo;ave I another fit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said Reggie Bungey, for &rsquo;twas none more strange than  he.<br>
  &ldquo;Pardon me? From your appearance, you&rsquo;re a native here I see.<br>
  May I glean some information of the fauna that abound<br>
  In this wild delightful woodland and the countryside around?</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I am a taxidermist.&rdquo; &ldquo;Taxey whatsey?&rdquo; murmured Bill.<br>
  &ldquo;Taxidermist,&rdquo; answered Reggie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be grateful if you will<br>
  Tell me of some bird or reptile roaming in these parts, you see?<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll gladly pay for any information tendered me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reptiles,&rdquo; pondered William, &ldquo;Reptiles? Snakes, I s&rsquo;pose, and  lizards, too?<br>
  Look &rsquo;ere, mister; I ken put ye on t&rsquo;a squirmin&rsquo;, bloomin&rsquo; zoo!<br>
  Reptiles! Blime! Why, I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em be the thousand lately, mate &mdash;<br>
  Pink &rsquo;uns, blue &rsquo;uns, spotted red &rsquo;uns. Sorts ye&rsquo;d never dream of, straight!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Purple snakes with crinkled stockin&rsquo;s, yaller frogs with scarlet  bands,<br>
  Crimson rats, an&rsquo; cock-a-roaches standin&rsquo; on ther&rsquo; bloomin&rsquo; &rsquo;ands;<br>
  Why, I&rsquo;ve seen a blue goanner playin&rsquo; circus with a ant;<br>
  Spotted spiders chewin&rsquo; damper, with their whiskers all aslant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red-&rsquo;aired toads with greenish eyeballs an&rsquo; the&rsquo;r weskits  inside-out;<br>
  Blue-necked mice an&rsquo; pink deaf-adders chasin&rsquo; catterworms about.<br>
  I &rsquo;ave seen bald-headed ringworms drinkin&rsquo; hoss-shoes be the pint;<br>
  Whip snakes kickin&rsquo; crippled beetles till the&rsquo;r toes wus out o&rsquo; jint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;ve &mdash;&rdquo; &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; cried Reggie, wildly. &ldquo;Have you met them in  the scrub?&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;about a mile on. Up at Paddy Casey&rsquo;s pub.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Reggie, &ldquo;I will call there when I come this way again.<br>
  Now, I really must be leaving. Don&rsquo;t you think it looks like rain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Handing Wayback Will a sovereign, wildly down the track he tore.<br>

  &ldquo;Settin&rsquo; things an&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; things to grow for folks to eat:<br>
  That&rsquo;s the life,&rdquo; my father said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s very hard to beat.&rdquo;<br>
  For my father was a farmer, as his father was before,<br>
  Just sowin&rsquo; things an&rsquo; growin&rsquo; things in far-off days of yore,<br>
  In the far-off land of England, till my father found his feet<br>
  In the new land, in the true land, where he took to growin&rsquo; wheat.<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! Oh, the sound of it is sweet!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been praisin&rsquo; it an&rsquo; raisin&rsquo; it in rain an&rsquo; wind an&rsquo; heat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the time I learned to toddle, till it&rsquo;s beatin&rsquo; in my noddle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the little song I&rsquo;m singin&rsquo; you of Wheat, Wheat, Wheat.</i></p>
<p>Plantin&rsquo; things&mdash;an&rsquo; grantin&rsquo; things is goin&rsquo; as they should,<br>
  An&rsquo; the weather altogether is behavin&rsquo; pretty good&mdash;<br>
  Is a pleasure in a measure for a man that likes the game,<br>
  An&rsquo; my father he would rather raise a crop than make a name.<br>
  For my father was a farmer, an&rsquo; &ldquo;All fame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t reel;<br>
  An&rsquo; the same it isn&rsquo;t fillin&rsquo; when you&rsquo;re wantin&rsquo; for a meal.&rdquo;<br>
  So I&rsquo;m followin&rsquo; his footsteps, an&rsquo; a-keepin&rsquo; of my feet,<br>
  While I cater for the nation with my Wheat, Wheat, Wheat.<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! When the poets all are beat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the reason that the season for the verse crop is a cheat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I comes up bright an&rsquo; grinnin&rsquo; with the knowledge that I&rsquo;m winnin&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the rhythm of my harvester an&rsquo; Wheat, Wheat, Wheat.</i></p>
<p>Readin&rsquo; things an&rsquo; heedin&rsquo; things that clever fellers give,<br>
  An&rsquo; ponderin&rsquo; an&rsquo; wonderin&rsquo; why we was meant to live&mdash;<br>
  Muddlin&rsquo; through an&rsquo; fuddlin&rsquo; through philosophy an&rsquo; such<br>
  Is a game I never took to, an&rsquo; it doesn&rsquo;t matter much.<br>
  For my father was a farmer, as I might &rsquo;a&rsquo; said before,<br>
  An&rsquo; the sum of his philosophy was, &ldquo;Grow a little more.<br>
  For growin&rsquo; things,&rdquo; my father said, &ldquo;it makes life sort o&rsquo; sweet<br>
  An&rsquo; your conscience never swats you if your game is growin&rsquo; wheat.&rdquo;<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! Oh, the people have to eat!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;re servin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; deservin&rsquo; of a velvet-cushion seat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the cocky-farmers&rsquo; heaven when you come to throw a seven;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; your password at the portal will be, &ldquo;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Now, the preacher an&rsquo; the teacher have a callin&rsquo; that is high<br>
  While they&rsquo;re spoutin&rsquo; to the doubtin&rsquo; of the happy by an&rsquo; by;<br>
  But I&rsquo;m sayin&rsquo; that the prayin&rsquo; it is better for their souls<br>
  When they&rsquo;ve plenty wheat inside &rsquo;em in the shape of penny rolls.<br>
  For my father was a farmer, an&rsquo; he used to sit an&rsquo; grieve<br>
  When he thought about the apple that old Adam got from Eve.<br>
  It was foolin&rsquo; with an orchard where the serpent got &rsquo;em beat,<br>
  An&rsquo; they might &rsquo;a&rsquo; kept the homestead if they&rsquo;d simply stuck to wheat.<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! If you&rsquo;re seekin&rsquo; to defeat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Care an&rsquo; worry in the hurry of the crowded city street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leave the hustle all behind you; come an&rsquo; let contentment find you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a cosy little cabin lyin&rsquo; snug among the wheat.</i></p>
<p>In the city, more&rsquo;s the pity, thousands live an&rsquo; thousands die<br>
  Never carin&rsquo;, never sparin&rsquo; pains that fruits may multiply;<br>
  Breathin&rsquo;, livin&rsquo;, never givin&rsquo;; greedy but to have an&rsquo; take,<br>
  Dyin&rsquo; with no day behind &rsquo;em lived for fellow-mortals&rsquo; sake.<br>
  Now my father was a farmer, an&rsquo; he used to sit and laugh<br>
  At the &ldquo;fools o&rsquo; life,&rdquo; he called &rsquo;em, livin&rsquo; on the other half.<br>
  Dyin&rsquo; lonely, missin&rsquo; only that one joy that makes life sweet&mdash;<br>
  Just the joy of useful labour, such as comes of growin&rsquo; wheat.<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! Let the foolish scheme an&rsquo; cheat;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I&rsquo;d rather, like my father, when my span o&rsquo; life&rsquo;s complete,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Feel I&rsquo;d lived by helpin&rsquo; others; earned the right to call &rsquo;em brothers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who had gained while I was gainin&rsquo; from God&rsquo;s earth His gift of wheat.</i></p>
<p>When the settin&rsquo; sun is gettin&rsquo; low above the western hills,<br>
  When the creepin&rsquo; shadows deepen, and a peace the whole land fills,<br>
  Then I often sort o&rsquo; soften with a feelin&rsquo; like content,<br>
  An&rsquo; I feel like thankin&rsquo; Heaven for a day in labour spent.<br>
  For my father was a farmer, an&rsquo; he used to sit an&rsquo; smile,<br>
  Realizin&rsquo; he was wealthy in what makes a life worth while.<br>
  Smilin&rsquo;, he has told me often, &ldquo;After all the toil an&rsquo; heat,<br>
  Lad, he&rsquo;s paid in more than silver who has grown one field of wheat.&rdquo;<br>
  <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheat, Wheat, Wheat! When it comes my turn to meet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Death the Reaper, an&rsquo; the Keeper of the Judgment Book I greet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I&rsquo;ll face &rsquo;em sort o&rsquo; calmer with the solace of the farmer<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That he&rsquo;s fed a million brothers with his Wheat, Wheat, Wheat.</i></p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheCruiseoftheNightmare"></a>The Cruise of the &ldquo;Nightmare.&rdquo;</b></h2>
<p>Ofttimes strange dreams have haunted me, of weird and fearsome  things;<br>
  Such dreams as midnight reading or a heavy supper brings.<br>
  Of nightmares I have had a few, but none of them could rank<br>
  With the time when I was chased from Oodnadatta to Mount Schank.<br>
  Now I have a secret hobby for collecting native names,<br>
  For the native nomenclature oft my admiration claims.<br>
  Whoever &rsquo;twas created them the highest praise deserves,<br>
  But tho&rsquo; they&rsquo;re sweet they&rsquo;re apt at times to get upon the nerves.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>My dream at first was pleasant. It was filled with beasts and  birds<br>
  Most beautiful. To picture them I&rsquo;m beggared quite for words.<br>
  When suddenly I noticed, from behind a mulga tree,<br>
  A horrid looking bunyip glaring banefully at me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll not attempt to picture him &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t if I tried &mdash;<br>
  For I turned at once and bolted. There was not a place to hide;<br>
  And after me careering came that horrid looking chap,<br>
  And he did not give me respite till he&rsquo;d chased me round the map.</p>
<p>He ran me thro&rsquo; to Paratoo, then to Tantanoola;<br>
  Wallaroo, Kalangadoo, over Arkaroola;<br>
  Wirrawilla, Yankalilla, up to Winnininnie;<br>
  Andamooka, Taltabooka, into Yudnapinnie;<br>
  Booborowie, Yeltacowie, round to Thackaringa;<br>
  Moralana, Wangianna, out by Wadnaminga;<br>
  Balcanoona, Pepegoona, up to Oodnadatta;<br>
  Mocatoona and Aroona into Boolcoomatta;<br>
  Italowie, Edeowie, then to Oratunga;<br>
  Burra Burra and Pandurra round about Willunga.</p>
<p>By now my legs were weakening and my wind was failing me.<br>
  And that horrid looking bunyip he was gaining, I could see.<br>
  But the nightmare stood beside me, so I leaped astride her back.<br>
  And she carried me as quietly as any common hack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kopperamanna,  Umberatana,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into  Warrioota;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrapatana, Parabarana,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing  thro&rsquo; Baroota;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owieamdana, Nankaburyana,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out  to Yantawena;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from Wintabatinyana<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Westward  to Wilgena.</p>
<p>My flight had now assumed the shape of quite a pleasant ramble,<br>
  The pace seemed hardly greater than an ordinary amble,<br>
  My nightmare was a stayer, fairly fit in wind and limb,<br>
  So we cantered from the bunyip, with a view to losing him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarrowie, Terowie;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Willowie, Telowie;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gumbowie, Caltowie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aldinga.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tarcowie, Coobowie;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outowie, Canowie;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Warcowie, Condowie,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kooringa.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kapunda, Tanunda;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manunda, Eudunda;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Koolunga, Echunga,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Winnowie.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beltana, Callana;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wooltana, The Anna;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Woolyana, Pandanna,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yarcowie.</p>
<p>We cantered thus for many miles, when, glancing to the rear,<br>
  It terrified me to behold the bunyip drawing near.<br>
  I knew my mare could lose him, if her wind would only last her,<br>
  So I gripped the pads and urged her ever faster and still faster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Booleroo, Billeroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parneroo, Pineroo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutooroo, Morudoo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Garra.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orroroo, Beetaloo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waukaloo, Warnamboo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ninkerloo, Yednaloo,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parra.</p>
<p>Oh, the places streamed behind us as we galloped like the wind,<br>
  And we left that horrid bunyip full a thousand miles behind.<br>
  The mare was sure the fleetest thing I ever chanced to ride.<br>
  Such bumps as Moondiepitchnie she included in her stride,<br>
  Until at last she bungled, and we came an awful spill in a<br>
  Confounded little creek they call Wergowerangerillina.</p>

  I&rsquo;m sure you understand the sort wot&rsquo;s meant.</p>
<p>Just wot you&rsquo;d call a gawky lump &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slim, slab-sided lump.<br>
  You&rsquo;d scarcely &rsquo;ave the nerve to call &rsquo;er <i>fat</i>.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kinder stick, but not so  thick.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Not this &rsquo;ere wench.<br>

  I say that Sue she weren&rsquo;t no Parleyvoo.</p>
<p>She didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no width, this piece &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  This elongated piece;<br>
  The figger that she <i>&rsquo;ad</i> was mostly length.<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; I tell you, she reminded me<br>
  Of one perpetual lease<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That doesn&rsquo;t cease.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lengthy bit o&rsquo; skirt;<br>
  She wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no truck with any bloke,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although she knew as well as you<br>
  She weren&rsquo;t built for a flirt;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She&rsquo;d treat like dirt<br>

  To tell the truth, they weren&rsquo;t <i>inclined</i> to joke.</p>
<p>O&rsquo; course this piece o&rsquo; muslin knew &mdash;<br>

  She&rsquo;d wander on &rsquo;er lonely down to town.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All on &rsquo;er own, that is, alone:<br>
  An&rsquo; she was just the kind<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; To &rsquo;ave a mind;<br>
  An&rsquo; so she travelled down.<br>
  I say, she packed her duds an&rsquo; travelled down.</p>
<p>She stayed away about a week<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; I think about a week;<br>
  An&rsquo; then she wandered back to Sheaoak   Town,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; An&rsquo; when they knew that it <i>was</i> Sue<br>
  The people couldn&rsquo;t speak,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They was that weak.<br>
  <i>This</i> was no up-an&rsquo;-down!<br>
  I tell you she was <i>fur</i> from up-an&rsquo;-down.</p>
<p>We simply &rsquo;ad to stand an&rsquo; gape &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; Just simply stand an&rsquo; gape.<br>
  We was too dazed for any sane remark.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You&rsquo;d be inclined to call to  mind<br>
  When you beheld &rsquo;er shape<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath its drape,<br>
  A statoo in a park &mdash;<br>
  A Veenus or somethin&rsquo; in a park.</p>
<p>O&rsquo; course we thought &rsquo;twas mighty rum &mdash;<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  There stood out Sue, <i>in straight fronts, too!</i><br>
  An&rsquo; then the truth it come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; struck us dumb.<br>
  The bloomin&rsquo; girl was <i>packed!</i><br>
  &lsquo;Er &rsquo;ips an&rsquo; all etceterers was PACKED!</p>
<p>But Sue she merely tossed &rsquo;er &rsquo;ead &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just proudly tossed &rsquo;er &rsquo;ead &mdash;<br>
  An&rsquo; never give a thought to climbin&rsquo; down.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t so bad as I do pad.&rdquo;<br>

  &ldquo;They <i>all</i> pad up, in town.<br>
  There ain&rsquo;t a girl that <i>don&rsquo;t</i> pad up, in town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We reckoned, up in Sheaoak  Town &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Old folks in Sheaoak   Town &mdash;<br>
  She&rsquo;d fairly done &rsquo;er chance in with the boys.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo; course, <i>they</i> knew the  shape o&rsquo; Sue.<br>
  An&rsquo; yet they chased &rsquo;er roun&rsquo;,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Yes, up and down,<br>
  Although they knew &rsquo;twas pads,<br>
  An&rsquo; just &rsquo;ow much <i>was</i> girl an&rsquo; &rsquo;ow much pads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Er prance an&rsquo; waddle made me mad;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Er walk near drove me mad;<br>
  But ev&rsquo;ry other girl was fairly stacked.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;She was a bloomin&rsquo; gawk, was  Sue.<br>
  But now,&rdquo; ses ev&rsquo;ry lad,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t too bad<br>
  Fer she is rorty, packed.<br>
  <i>She&rsquo;s just a bloomin&rsquo; Juno now she&rsquo;s packed.&rdquo;</i><br>

  To see the way she &rsquo;eld &rsquo;er skirts &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The way she <i>gripped</i> &rsquo;er  skirts &mdash;<br>
  See &rsquo;ere, I ain&rsquo;t straight-laced, meself, perhaps,<br>
  &nbsp; &nbsp; But, spare me days!&nbsp; That woman&rsquo;s way!<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheBleatingOfTheSheep"></a>The Bleating Of The Sheep</b></h2>
<p>Lo, I listened to the bleating of the sheep &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Squatters&rsquo; sheep &mdash;<br>
  And I sat me down and pondered long and deep.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a cloud of gloom came o&rsquo;er me<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the empty leagues before me &mdash;<br>
  Yea, I marked the virgin grass-lands&rsquo; mighty sweep &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Land that called for cultivation;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cried aloud for population &mdash;<br>
  Land that carried trees and fences, grass and sheep.</p>
<p>O, I listened to their bleating on the plain &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Virgin plain &mdash;<br>
  And I spoke to them with epithets profane.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the valley, on the hill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet were sheep, and more sheep  still.<br>
  (Which annoyed me very much, I must explain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one sheep may be a blessing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a million are depressing.)<br>
  And I cursed them, but I knew I cursed in vain.</p>
<p>Lo! and then I fell a-dreaming where I sat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sadly sat &mdash;<br>
  Till I didn&rsquo;t see what I was looking at.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my dream was most alluring.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah! But, had it been enduring,<br>
  What a reckoning it would have been for Fat!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a blessing for Australia<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If my dream &mdash; but <i>inter alia</i>,<br>
  I&rsquo;ll explain to you what I am driving at.</p>
<p>Lo! (excuse this weird redundancy of &ldquo;lo,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soulful &ldquo;lo&rdquo;;<br>
  But I want to be impressive, you must know).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lo! instead of jumbucks bleating,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the reaper&rsquo;s beating;<br>
  And I saw abundant milk and honey flow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I espied snug homesteads dotted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&rsquo;er the plain.&nbsp; I also spotted<br>
  Towns, with factories and workshops, rise and grow.</p>
<p>Ay, at busy line of commerce filled the place &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Desert place &mdash;<br>
  And mine eyes beheld a happy populace<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wresting from the land its treasure<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loving work and earning leisure.<br>
  Industry and population grew apace.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear the hammers ringing;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Happy housewives blithely singing;<br>
  And I read Prosperity in every face.</p>
<p>Then I saw a file of troops go marching past &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bravely past.<br>
  Adown the plain I heard the bugle&rsquo;s blast.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beheld the banners streaming,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I fancied in my dreaming<br>
  That our happy country owned an army vast.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each patriot marched proudly<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By, he cried, exulting loudly,<br>
  <i>&ldquo;Fair Australia  is safely ours at last!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Then a large, red man rode up upon a horse,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Large roan horse),<br>
  And spoke to me in strident tones and coarse.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And his discourse was (diluted)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Wanderers are prosecuted<br>
  On this crimson run.&nbsp; Now get!&rdquo;&nbsp; I got &mdash; of course.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve said, the man was bulky,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And he seemed morose and sulky;<br>
  And it just occurred to me he <i>might</i> use force.</p>
<p>But, in spite of him, my dream I still may keep &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fondly keep.<br>
  And from out it sprouts the wisdom that I reap<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the benefit of all men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But especially of little men.<br>
  (Meaning men whose wealth does not exceed one heap.)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, the lesson is before you &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pray forgive me if I bore you;<br>
  But, my brothers, heed the lesson of the sheep!</p>
<p>For, hark ye, hear the bleating of the sheep &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Human sheep!<br>
  (O, my brothers, but their sheephood makes me weep!)<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark ye, how they flock together<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After some old, sly bell-wether &mdash;<br>
  One that Fat finds it convenient to keep;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch them how they follow, follow.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See the verbal weeds they swallow,<br>
  And the squatter keeps his grass for <i>paying</i> sheep.</p>
<p>O, the squatter has of woolly sheep a lot &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite a lot;<br>
  But they&rsquo;re not the only sort of sheep he&rsquo;s got.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; How he profits by their fleeces<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, when price of meat decreases -<br>
  Human meat &mdash; the butcher, Fat, will take the lot.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O, ye farmers and selectors!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Landless voters!&nbsp; Free electors!<br>
  Think, my brothers: are ye sheep, or are ye not?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSilentMember"></a>The Silent Member</b></h2>
<p>He&nbsp;lived in Mundaloo, and Bill McClosky was his name,<br>
  But folks that knew him well had little knowledge of that same;<br>
  For he some&rsquo;ow lost his surname, and he had so much to say&mdash;<br>
  He was called &ldquo;The Silent Member&rdquo; in a mild, sarcastic way.</p>
<p>He could talk on any subject&mdash;from the weather and the crops<br>
  To astronomy and Euclid, and he never minded stops;<br>
  And the lack of a companion didn&rsquo;t lay him on the shelf,<br>
  For he&rsquo;d stand before a looking-glass and argue with himself.</p>
<p>He would talk for hours on literature, or calves, or art, or wheat;<br>
  There was not a bally subject you could say had got him beat;<br>
  And when strangers brought up topics that they reckoned he would baulk,<br>
  He&rsquo;d remark, &ldquo;I never heard of that.&rdquo; But all the same&mdash;he&rsquo;d talk.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d talk at christ&rsquo;nings by the yard; at weddings by the mile;<br>
  And he used to pride himself upon his choice of words and style.<br>
  In a funeral procession his remarks would never end<br>
  On the qualities and virtues of the dear departed friend.</p>
<p>We got quite used to hearing him, and no one seemed to care&mdash;<br>
  In fact, no happ&rsquo;ning seemed complete unless his voice was there.<br>
  For close on thirty year he talked, and none could talk him down,<br>
  Until one day an agent for insurance struck the town.</p>
<p>Well, we knew The Silent Member, and we knew what he could do,<br>
  And it wasn&rsquo;t very long before we knew the agent, too,<br>
  As a crack long-distance talker that was pretty hard to catch;<br>
  So we called a hasty meeting and decided on a match.</p>
<p>Of course, we didn&rsquo;t tell them we were putting up the game;<br>
  But we fixed it up between us, and made bets upon the same.<br>
  We named a time-keep and a referee to see it through;<br>
  Then strolled around, just casual, and introduced the two.</p>
<p>The agent got first off the mark, while our man stood and grinned;<br>
  He talked for just one solid hour, then stopped to get his wind.<br>
  &ldquo;Yes; but&mdash;&rdquo; sez Bill; that&rsquo;s all he said; he couldn&rsquo;t say no more;<br>
  The agent got right in again, and fairly held the floor.</p>
<p>On policies, and bonuses, and premiums, and all that,<br>
  He talked and talked until we thought he had our man out flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  &ldquo;I think&mdash;&rdquo; Bill got in edgeways, but that there insurance chap<br>
  Just filled himself with atmosphere, and took the second lap.</p>
<p>I saw our man was getting dazed, and sort of hypnotized,<br>
  And they oughter pulled the agent up right there, as I advised.<br>
  &ldquo;See here&mdash;&rdquo; Bill started, husky; but the agent came again,<br>
  And talked right on for four hours good&mdash;from six o&rsquo;clock to ten.</p>
<p>Then Bill began to crumple up, and weaken at the knees,<br>
  When all at once he ups and shouts, &ldquo;Here, give a bloke a breeze!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
  Just take a pull for half a tick and let me have the floor,<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll take out a policy.&rdquo; The agent said no more.</p>
<p>The Silent Member swallowed hard, then coughed and cleared his throat,<br>
  But not a single word would come&mdash;no; not a blessed note.<br>
  His face looked something dreadful&mdash;such a look of pained dismay;<br>
  Then he have us one pathetic glance, and turned, and walked away.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s hardly spoken since that day&mdash;not more than &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo;.<br>
  We miss his voice a good bit, too; the town seems rather slow.<br>
  He was called &ldquo;The Silent Member&rdquo; just sarcastic, I&rsquo;ll allow;<br>
  But since that agent handled him it sort o&rsquo; fits him now.</p>

  An&rsquo; as I ses, las&rsquo; week, to Sam &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Sam McQueen,<br>
  That owns the pace &rsquo;tween mine an&rsquo; Jones &mdash;<br>
  Or rather, when I say he owns<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The place I mean<br>
  He rents it, like, frum off the State;<br>
  An&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the same at any rate &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pays no rent:<br>
  Fer, same as me, an&rsquo; all the lot<br>
  Of cockies here, he hasn&rsquo;t got<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A blessed cent.<br>
  Much less arrears an&rsquo; things to spare<br>
  When all his house&rsquo;old debts are square<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down at the store.<br>
  In fact, most years when we have sold<br>
  The crop, we find the debt, all told,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A trifle more.</p>
<p>Ole Sam an&rsquo; me, we&rsquo;ve had our groan,<br>
  When we have reaped not where we&rsquo;ve sown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve railed an&rsquo; cried;<br>
  But now we&rsquo;re hardened, him an&rsquo; me,<br>
  An&rsquo; preach the good ole policy<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of let it slide.<br>
  But tho&rsquo; I hold it ain&rsquo;t no use,<br>
  There&rsquo;s times when Sam ull get the blues<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; pitches tales<br>
  Of things that might have been, but ain&rsquo;t;<br>
  &rsquo;Twould try the temper of a saint &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way he rails,<br>
  At times, about his dearth of tin,<br>
  An&rsquo; how he might have been well in<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Had he been wise.<br>
  Fer we have struck some payin&rsquo; deals,<br>
  An&rsquo; had our twenty bushel yeil&rsquo;s,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An&rsquo; made a rise;<br>
  But if we acted spen&rsquo;thrift then,<br>
  An&rsquo; if those times don&rsquo;t come again,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What use to damn<br>
  Our foolishness of those days, now?<br>
  The chance is gone&mdash;well, let it go;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I ses, &ldquo;Sam &mdash;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;The land it was me cradle, an&rsquo; the land ull be me grave;<br>
  It might uv been my forchune if I&rsquo;d sense enough to save.<br>
  Tho&rsquo; &rsquo;tis fickle with its favours, an&rsquo; it varies in its wage,<br>
  It ull have to be me stan&rsquo;-by in me old, old age.&rdquo;</i> </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Toolangi"></a>Toolangi</b></h2>
<p>He was obviously English, in his Harris tweeds and stockings.<br>
  And his accent was of Oxford,  and his swagger and his style<br>
  Seemed to hint at halls baronial.&nbsp; He  despised the &ldquo;demned Colonial&rdquo;;<br>
  But he praised the things of England  with a large and toothful smile.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;d discourse for hours together on old England&rsquo;s splendid weather;<br>
  On her flowers and fruits and fashions, and her wild-fowl and her game.<br>
  At all Austral things he snorted; pinned his faith to the imported.<br>
  And he said the land was rotten.&nbsp; But he  stayed here just the same.</p>
<p>Why, he came or why he lingered he was never keen to mention;<br>
  But he hinted at connections &rsquo;mid old England&rsquo;s nobly grand.<br>
  Seems he drew a vague remittance &mdash; some folk said a meagre pittance &mdash;<br>
  And he sought to supplement it by a venture on the land.</p>
<p>So he journeyed to Toolangi, where the mountain ash yearns  skyward,<br>
  And the messmate and the blue-gum grow to quite abnormal size.<br>
  &rsquo;Spite the &ldquo;stately homes&rdquo; he vaunted, &rsquo;twas the simple life he wanted;<br>
  And he got it, good and plenty, at Toolangi on the rise.</p>
<p>It appears he had a notion that his &ldquo;breeding&rdquo; and his &ldquo;culture&rdquo;<br>
  Would assure him some position as a sort of country squire;<br>
  And he built a little chalet in a pretty, fern-clad valley,<br>
  And prepared to squire it nobly in imported farm attire.</p>
<p>But the &ldquo;breeding&rdquo; is in bullocks that they prize upon Toolangi.<br>
  Where the forelock-touching habit hasn&rsquo;t grown to any size.<br>
  And he found, as on he plodded, and the natives curtly nodded,<br>
  That their &ldquo;culture&rsquo;s&rdquo; agriculture at Toolangi on the rise.</p>
<p>First he started poultry farming, as a mild, genteel employment;<br>
  For the business promised profit, and the labor wasn&rsquo;t hard;<br>
  But he wondered what the dickens was becoming of his chickens,<br>
  Till he found some English foxes prowling round his poultry yard.</p>
<p>So he cursed at things Australian, and invested in an orchard<br>
  That adjoined his little holding: and foresaw a life of ease.<br>
  But a flock of English starlings &mdash; pretty, &ldquo;harmless&rdquo; little darlings &mdash;<br>
  Ate his apples and his peaches as they ripened on the trees.</p>
<p>Once again he cursed the country, and fell back on cabbage-growing  &mdash;<br>
  He had heard of fortunes gathered while the price was at the top<br>
  So he started, quite forgetting to erect the needful netting,<br>
  And some cheerful English rabbits finished off his cabbage crop.</p>
<p>Then his language grew tremendous, and he cursed at all the  country;<br>
  Cursed its flora and its fauna north and south, from coast to coast:<br>
  Sat and cursed for hours together, at the &ldquo;demned colonial weather&rdquo;;<br>
  Till an English snow-storm bit him just as he was cursing most.</p>
<p>When the snow falls on Toolangi wise folk look to beam and rafter.<br>
  For the fall is ofttimes heavy as upon the roof it lies;<br>
  And it crushed the dainty chalet nestling in the pretty valley,<br>
  In the little fern-clad valley at Toolangi on the rise.</p>
<p>He was cursing yet, and loudly, as he crawled from out the  wreckage:<br>
  Cursing as he packed his baggage and departed for his club,<br>
  For his club down in the city.&nbsp; Vulgar  folk &mdash; it seems a pity &mdash;<br>
  Hinted meanly that his club-house was a little back-street pub.</p>
<p>Now, away in far Toolangi, where the mountain peaks yearn skyward,<br>
  Folk will drop the dexter eyelid and the case epitomise;<br>
  &ldquo;Yes, &lsquo;the Duke&rsquo; has gone for ever.&nbsp;  British pests are far too clever.<br>
  And the English climate crushed him at Toolangi on the rise.&rdquo; </p>

  Out go the stars; an&rsquo; Day &rsquo;as jumped the joint.</p>
<p>The sun looks up, an&rsquo; wiv a cautious stare,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like some crook keekin&rsquo; o&rsquo;er a winder sill<br>

  An&rsquo; sez, &ldquo;&rsquo;Ooray! I knoo that we could win!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure of &rsquo;is title then, the champeen Day<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Begins to put on dawg among &rsquo;is push,<br>
  An&rsquo;, as he mooches on &rsquo;is gaudy way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drors tribute from each tree an&rsquo; flow&rsquo;r an&rsquo; bush.<br>
  An&rsquo;, w&rsquo;ile &rsquo;e swigs the dew in sylvan bars,<br>

<p>Then, lo! the push o&rsquo; Day rise to applaud;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; all &rsquo;is creatures clamour at &rsquo;is feet<br>
  Until &rsquo;e thinks&rsquo;imself a little gawd,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; swaggers on an&rsquo; kids &rsquo;imself a treat.<br>
  The w&rsquo;ile the lurkin&rsquo; barrackers o&rsquo; Night<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world bows to the Boshter Day.<br>
  The jealous Night speeds ethergrams thro&rsquo; space<br>
  &rsquo;Otly demandin&rsquo; terms, an&rsquo; time, an&rsquo; place.</p>

<p>Time does a bunk as us-u-al, nor stays<br>

  Whose noisy push, shorn of their &rsquo;igh-noon &rsquo;opes,<br>

  An&rsquo; narked, the sun, &rsquo;is backer, in a huff,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sneaks outer sight, red in the face wiv rage.<br>
  W&rsquo;ile gloomy roosters, they &rsquo;oo made the morn<br>
  Ring wiv &rsquo;is praises, creep to bed forlorn.</p>
<p>All faint an&rsquo; groggy grows the beaten Day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;E staggers drunkenly about the ring;<br>
  An owl &rsquo;oots jeerin&rsquo;ly across the way,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; bats come out to mock the fallin&rsquo; King.<br>
  Now, wiv a jolt, Night spreads &rsquo;im on the floor,<br>
  An&rsquo; all the west grows ruddy wiv &rsquo;is gore.</p>
<p>A single, vulgar star leers from the sky<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; in derision, rudely mutters, &ldquo;Yah!&rdquo;<br>
  The moon, Night&rsquo;s conkerbine, comes glidin&rsquo; by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An&rsquo; laughs a &rsquo;eartless, silvery &ldquo;Ha-ha!&rdquo;<br>
  Scorned, beaten, Day gives up the &rsquo;opeless fight,<br>

  Brothers o&rsquo; mine, brothers o&rsquo; mine.</i> </p>
<p>Good Brother Green at the service sat &mdash;<br>
  Sat in the chapel and bowed his head;<br>
  Praying most fervently into his hat;<br>
  Bending his knee when The Word was read.<br>
  For good Brother Green was a godly man &mdash;<br>
  A godly keristian; and what be more,<br>
  He loved all sinners, and carefully ran<br>
  A worldy and prosperous grocery store.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Brothers o&rsquo; mine, brothers o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo;<br>
  Quoted the preacher, with dolorous drone:<br>
  &ldquo;The Lord He hath given thee all that is thine.<br>

  Love thou thy neighbour! O, brothers o&rsquo; mine.&rdquo;</i> </p>

  Sat in the tavern and tossed his head,<br>
  Tilting a glass to the brim of his hat;<br>
  Bending his arm when the toast was said.<br>
  But comrade Hal was a godless man &mdash;<br>
  A godless sinner; and what be more,<br>
  He loved good liquor, and carelessly ran<br>
  A long, long bill at the grocery store.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Brother o&rsquo; mine, brother o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo;<br>
  Shouted the tippler in riotous tone,<br>
  &ldquo;Toiled thou, and sweated for all that is thine;<br>

  Breathing his piety into his hat;<br>
  Praying for guidance and praying for light;<br>
  Vowing unworthiness more and more;<br>
  With a nice warm feeling that all was right<br>
  With the business of Green&rsquo;s Cash Grocery Store.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;Brothers o&rsquo; mine, brothers o&rsquo; mine,&rdquo;<br>

  Tilting his glass to the brim of his hat;<br>
  Drinking from morn to the fall of night;<br>

<p>Monday morn, with a soul for work,<br>
  Good Brother Green stood rubbing his hands &mdash;<br>
  Rubbing his hands with an oily smirk;<br>
  Seeking the trade a good name commands.<br>
  Came there a widow who pleaded for time &mdash;<br>
  For a month, for a week!&nbsp; Ah, what would  it mean!<br>
  &ldquo;Sell up her sticks.&nbsp; This pretence is a  crime!<br>

    Which lov&rsquo;st thou of these brothers o&rsquo; thine?</i></p>
<p>Heavy and dull on the Monday morn,<br>
  Comrade Hal went rubbing his head -<br>
  Rubbing his head with an air forlorn;<br>
  Seeking the tavern where wine is red.<br>
  Passed he a beggar who aid invoked.<br>
  &ldquo;Catch, then, brother,&rdquo; he merely cried,<br>
  Spinning a coin as he smiled and joked.<br>
  &ldquo;Now I go thirsty,&rdquo; the tippler sighed.</p>
<p><i>Brothers o&rsquo; mine, brothers o&rsquo; mine &mdash;<br>

<p>Rose there then, within the land, one who made a strange demand;<br>
  This no less &mdash; that they should hand all surplus femininity &mdash;<br>
  Concubine and paramour &mdash; round to the deserving poor,<br>
  Holding to themselves secure each one a lone affinity.</p>
<p>Then polygamists, with fat quaking, asked by this and that,<br>
  What the Devil was he at?&nbsp; This was stark  insanity!<br>
  &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; they cried, in shocked surprise, &ldquo;Are you seeking &mdash; dash your eyes!&mdash;<br>
  To ruin private enterprise to satisfy your vanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the old monopolists ramped about and shook their fists,<br>
  Shouted, hooted, cursed and hissed.&nbsp; Men  of proven piety<br>
  Swore at him with language bad.&nbsp; &ldquo;Socialist!&rdquo;  they yelled. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re mad!<br>
  Visionary!&nbsp; Why your fad&rsquo;s <i>an insult  to society!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>But those dear old Tory chaps have departed; and, perhaps,<br>
  Modern marriage &mdash; bar mishaps &mdash; now satisfies democracy.<br>
  Thus, at last &mdash; at least they say &mdash; <i>that</i> reformer got his way;<br>
  And polygamy to-day revolts the aristocracy.</p>
<p>In the feudal days of yore, a baron &mdash; Tory to the core &mdash;<br>
  Owned a thousand serfs or more; and land? &mdash; he had the run of it<br>
  For many leagues about.&nbsp; But lo! a  foolish, low-born lout<br>
  Bewailed his lot, and blurted out he &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t see the fun of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roared the good old baron then, calling on his serving men;<br>
  Clapped the caitiff in a den; and swore with loud impiety.<br>
  &ldquo;Zounds! Gadzooks!&rdquo; the baron cried, when the rack had been applied.<br>
  &ldquo;A Socialist! &rsquo;Tis well he died! <i>A menace to society!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>So on, down throughout the ages, that old Tory person rages.<br>
  Note the cry, in all its stages, heard in every latitude.<br>
  Though the primal type has gone, hear the same old mastodon<br>
  Rave, and snort, and trumped on the same old Tory platitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the Socialistic fraud! Private Enterprise! Good Lord!<br>
  (Let the good news not get abroad.)&nbsp; It&rsquo;s  BLASPHEMY!! IMPIETY!!<br>
  It seeks my &lsquo;sacred rights&rsquo; to wrest; land, gold &mdash; all that&rsquo;s best.<br>
  Arrest it!&nbsp; <i>It is menacing respectable  society!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Same old tough polygamist; same old fat monopolist;<br>
  Greedy eye and grasping fist, air of sunny propriety.<br>
  Mastodon or merchant robber; feudal lord or Crown-lands jobber &mdash;<br>
  It&rsquo;s the same old Tory slobber, same old whine about &ldquo;society&rdquo;. </p>

<p>Strange men there were of ev&rsquo;ry age since Man did first increase,<br>

  On folk ill-clad in rags that had half-clothed them when they died &mdash;<br>
  Lord God, they&rsquo;re not <i>respectable!</i> Nay, have a care!&rdquo; they cried.</p>
<p>Then stepped there forth, consumed with wrath, an unctuous  alderman;<br>

  From many million &ldquo;genteel&rdquo; throats a shout went to the sky:<br>

<p>Close on their shout The Voice rang out, and took them like a  flood;<br>
  Till king and khan and alderman and prince of royal blood,<br>
  And chief and lord and preacher cowered and trembled where they stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye knew my life, ye knew my Law, ye mocked with hollow praise;<br>
  Ye knelt to me in blasphemy once in the Seven Days;<br>
  Then raised an idol in my place and went your idol&rsquo;s ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this ye turned; for this ye spurned the Man of Galilee;<br>
  And in your hearts ye sacrificed to other gods than me;<br>
  Nor ceased to crawl to it ye call &lsquo;Respectability.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when its Law was not my Law, say, whither did ye lean?<br>
  Did ye heed my Word or seek to aid my humble folk and mean?<br>
  Ye prayed unto a myth and scorned the lowly Nazarene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;E&rsquo;en as ye judged my People here, so are ye judged and weighed;<br>

  My folk they be; I know not ye.&nbsp; Go, call  your god to aid.&rdquo;</p>

  Avenging hosts of angels came &mdash; yet howled the stricken horde,<br>
  <i>&ldquo;Lord God, they&rsquo;re not respectable!&nbsp;  Be warned in time, O Lord!&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Then yawned agape and greedily a horrid, fiery cleft,<br>
  And prince and king and alderman, of pomp and pride bereft,<br>
  Went, pressed like herded cattle, till no trace of gloom was left.</p>
<p>Yet, as they fell, the gates of Hell gave back a cry that came &mdash;<br>
  Now far and faint, a doleful plaint&mdash;all muffled through the flame,<br>

  Like merry children at their play.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Aglow with careless life ....<br>
  And, muffled, like the roll of distant drums,<br>
  A drone of waters from the gully comes.</p>
<p>The Jack has laughed the whole day long &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A jocund bird is he!<br>
  This eve, a thrush his even song<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Pipes merrily to me.<br>
  He pipes of idle hours, of pleasant days,<br>
  Of lives cast blessedly in tranquil ways.</p>
<p>With peace and freedom over all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The summer day has flown;<br>
  And well content am I to call<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; This happy land mine own.<br>
  Mine own! ... And in the thrush&rsquo;s careless song<br>
  I mark a changing note: &ldquo;How long? How long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>How long?&nbsp; And, as the years  march on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Shall it be e&rsquo;er as this?<br>
  Or shall some alien look upon<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; These scenes we love &mdash; as his?<br>
  Still from the gully sounds that rhythmic beat:<br>
  The menace of the drums; the marching feet!</p>
<p>Shall this dear land we call our own<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Be ours one other year?<br>
  Mark how the drums have louder grown!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The tramping feet draw near!<br>
  And thro&rsquo; the drone breaks forth a warning voice:<br>
  &ldquo;Yours be the sacrifice!&nbsp; Yours is the  choice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The challenge of a bugle blast!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The thrush&rsquo;s song is lost.<br>
  Pale, stern-faced men march grimly past<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Where saplings swayed and tossed;<br>
  And where the peaceful clouds sailed slowly by,<br>
  I see black smoke of cannon in the sky.</p>
<p>I mark the smoke of cannon rise<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To hide the summer sun;<br>
  I hear the soldiers&rsquo; fighting cries,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The booming of a gun.<br>
  My countrymen!&nbsp; Our summer day has flown!<br>
  To-morrow! &mdash; shall this loved land be our own?</p>
<p>Ours is the choice. And shall our sons,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; When those dark days are o&rsquo;er &mdash;<br>
  When stilled again are drums and guns &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Sit each beside his door? &mdash;<br>
  Beside his own house-door and proudly say,<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis to our sires we owe this summer day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or shall they, vanquished and enslaved,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Mourn for a country lost &mdash;<br>
  The land their fathers might have saved<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Who meanly shirked the cost?<br>
  And shall they curse, upon that evil day,<br>
  The dolts who dreamed one summer time away?</p>
<p>Beside mine own house-door am I,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; With all the world at peace,<br>
  A little cloud trails slowly by<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Its torn and tattered fleece,<br>
  And sweetly, to my idle ear there comes<br>
  The note of happy bird-talk in the gums.</p>
<p>The brown-tipped saplings bend and gleam,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Like careless boys at play:<br>
  Like careless boys we laugh, we dream<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The livelong summer day.....<br>
  Louder the sound from out the gully comes;<br>
  The marching feet; the sullen roll of drums.</p>

<p><i>Now a hat is a hat, and a head is a head,<br>
  And there&rsquo;s &ldquo;reason in most things,&rdquo; as someone has said,<br>
  And a joke is a joke; but, I give you a word,<br>
  This roofing of kings is becoming absurd.</i> </p>
<p>In days neolithic, when clothing was rare,<br>
  And a trogkodyte&rsquo;s wardrobe comprised mainly hair<br>
  When a nose-bone and anklet were reckoned &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo;<br>
  The cave-men elected a kind of a king.</p>
<p>Then trouble arose; for the bloke in the street<br>
  Didn&rsquo;t bow to the king when they happened to meet;<br>
  For when a king&rsquo;s hairiness sums up his clobber,<br>
  A loyalist hardly knows when he should slobber.</p>
<p>This king set to work, with a serious frown,<br>
  And in fewer than six months he&rsquo;d invented the crown &mdash;<br>
  A mere wreath of rushes, not much of a thing,<br>
  But it published the fact that the wearer was king.</p>
<p>Now, I put it to you, as a man to a man<br>
  There was reason and sense in that troglodyte&rsquo;s plan;<br>
  For as he remarked, &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t much of a fit,<br>
  But &rsquo;twill help to proclaim to the crowd I am <i>It</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he didn&rsquo;t call round him his dukes and his lords,<br>
  His cousins and aunts, and relations in hordes,<br>
  His troglodyte bishops to buther and rave;<br>
  No, he just shoved it on in his own private cave.</p>
<p>But the king who came next was a vain sort of man<br>
  (And this is just where all the trouble began).<br>
  He was fond of a &ldquo;function&rdquo; and eager for show;<br>
  And he sowed all the seeds of the nonsense we know.</p>
<p>It started like that; and the foolishness grew<br>
  From inviting a friendly and intimate few,<br>
  Till the time when the whole blinded nation was bid on<br>
  The day when the king had to get his new lid on.</p>
<p>With a babble the rabble goes forth to the Fog,<br>
  Forgetting the rent, and forsaking the dog;<br>
  They are rushing to London  and all because &mdash; Why?<br>
  To see a crown cocked o&rsquo;er the boss-prince&rsquo;s eye!</p>
<p>From its innermost heart to its outermost spot<br>
  The whole bloomin&rsquo; Empire has gone off its dot.<br>
  For to count &ldquo;any class&rdquo; you must be in the swim,<br>
  And shout with the crowd at the hatting, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;im!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;is &rsquo;ighness the King with the large golden hat &mdash;<br>
  It&rsquo;s worth twice the money to see &rsquo;im like that!&rdquo;<br>
  And every old person &ldquo;of note&rdquo; will be there,<br>
  Who can dodge the collector and rake up the fare.</p>
<p>Barons and bishops and boodlers in hordes,<br>
  The earliest earls and the lordliest lords,<br>
  Nabobs and niggers from India&rsquo;s  strand<br>
  And the juiciest Jews that they raise on the Rand.</p>
<p>Marshals and marquises, brewers in sheaves,<br>
  Admirals, aldermen, stock-exchange thieves,<br>
  And the duckiest duchesses, gorgeously gowned,<br>
  Will flock into London  to see the King crowned.</p>
<p>Princes and premiers from over the seas<br>
  Will jostle the Rajahs and Labor M.P.&rsquo;s;<br>
  The peerage and beerage will crowd in the Stand,<br>
  With squatters and rotters who libel their land.</p>
<p>And, when you consider the crowd and the time,<br>
  You expect them to burst into babyish rhyme:<br>
  &ldquo;With a rumpity-bump, and a pit-a-pit-pat.<br>
  To see an archbishop put on the king&rsquo;s hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I put it to you, as a friend to a friend:<br>
  What the deuce is the <i>use</i> of it all in the end?<br>
  For you&rsquo;d think, once he&rsquo;s under his gorgeous cover,<br>
  There ought to be <i>something</i> to show when it&rsquo;s over.</p>
<p>But, save you! he don&rsquo;t wear the thing in the street,<br>
  To signify something to coves he may meet;<br>
  He wraps it in wadding and puts it away,<br>
  And wears a plain billycock tile every day!</p>
<p>And when all the blither and blather is o&rsquo;er,<br>
  The rustle and bustle, the rush and the roar,<br>
  Then, this is what calls for hilarious laughter:<br>
  <i>He&rsquo;s just as much monarch before it as after!</i></p>
<p>The bills and the bailiffs come round as before,<br>
  And buzz-flies will buzz in the springtime once more,<br>
  It doesn&rsquo;t make milkers or mining shares rise,<br>
  Or cure indigestion or specks &rsquo;fore the eyes.</p>
<p>The welkin may ring with the national glee,<br>
  (You&rsquo;ll know, though I don&rsquo;t, what the welkin may be).<br>
  And the &ldquo;thin crimson thread of our kinship&rdquo; may twang;<br>
  But <i>that</i> ain&rsquo;t improvin&rsquo; the birthrate a hang.</p>
<p>So, I put it to you, as a cobber to cobber;<br>
  Do <i>you</i> see the sense of this silly old slobber?<br>
  Take any old head, and take any old hat,<br>
  Sove one on the other &mdash; what&rsquo;s there in that?</p>
<p><i>For a hat is a hat, and a head is a head,<br>
  And a joke is a joke, as I&rsquo;ve previously said;<br>
  But a farce is a farce, and, I give you my word,<br>
  This roofing of kings is becoming absurd.</i></p>

  Our laws in the days of the Biff brigade;<br>
  In the days of valor and old Romance,<br>
  When a hasty word or an angry glance<br>
  Brought vengeance, swift as a shooting star;<br>
  And a member hurtled across the bar.<br>
  When a man relied on his strong right hand,<br>
  And &mdash; a book, or a bottle, or a glass ink-stand;<br>
  When the Speaker&rsquo;s voice, like the Crack o&rsquo; Doom,<br>
  Echoed and volleyed across the room,<br>
  Suspending members in threes and fours<br>

  And who can picture the baresark rage<br>
  Of a member baulked of a Minister&rsquo;s wage?<br>
  &rsquo;Twas woe to the member who failed to duck<br>
  When the missiles flew in that ancient ruck.<br>
  And woe to the Speaker who left the Chair<br>
  Without precaution, without due care<br>
  That the way was clear for a swift retreat;<br>
  For....Hist!....Was that thunder?&nbsp; Nay, &rsquo;twas  the feet<br>
  Of the Opposition in swift pursuit,<br>
  Eager to settle an old dispute;<br>
  Eager to settle it then and there,<br>
  Like hounds on the scent of a startled hare.<br>
  For a feud was a feud, and a clan was a clan,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In Parliament under the Party plan.</p>
<p>Was a man too timid to tell the truth<br>
  Because of a Sergeant-at-Arms, forsooth?<br>
  Was a man too craven to speak his mind<br>
  For fear of the Law and the men behind?<br>
  Was a man to be hounded from place and pay<br>
  By the votes of an ignorant people?&nbsp; Nay!<br>
  An interjection, a word misplaced,<br>

<p>Those were the days when a member fought<br>
  For his place and pay as a strong man ought;<br>
  When they spoke their minds till the borrowed hair<br>
  Stood straight on the head of the startled Chair;<br>
  When they said their say, till the clerks turned pale,<br>
  And the pressmen bent &rsquo;fore the awful gale.<br>
  And many a fierce and gory fight<br>
  Cheered up the sitting on some late night.<br>
  But finest of all was the last brave stand<br>
  Of the member for Fatville, Claude Legrand,<br>
  The hope, the pride of the Cursing Clan....<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In Parliament under the Party plan.</p>
<p>He had called the Premier a low-bred hound,<br>
  He had scattered a few choice names around,<br>
  But he scarce had warmed to his subject yet,<br>
  When the insolent Speaker bade him &mdash; &ldquo;get!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;What?&rdquo;....For an instant a hush like death<br>
  Fell on the House; and the labored breath<br>
  Of the pressmen, over the Speaker&rsquo;s Chair,<br>
  Was the only sound on the calm, still air.<br>
  Then....Biff!....Like a tiger Claude Legrand<br>
  Reached down, and, straight from his strong right hand,<br>
  His boot came fair at the Speaker&rsquo;s head,<br>
  And he dropped from the Chair like a thing of lead.<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the signal!....<i>Boom!!</i>&nbsp; In  the far-off street<br>
  They heard that thunder of rushing feet;<br>
  They heard the shrieks as the members fell<br>
  With a smothered curse or a muffled yell.<br>
  For their blood was up when the fight began<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In Parliament under the Party plan.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas an even battle; this way and that<br>
  The members struggled and fought and spat<br>
  Fierce oaths and teeth, as they tore and scratched,<br>
  Ay, the sides that day were right well matched.<br>
  Evenly matched till &mdash; ah, tell it with shame &mdash;<br>
  At the Government&rsquo;s bidding policemen came!<br>
  And six of them hastened to Claude Legrand<br>
  Where he fought and cursed at the head of his band.<br>
  Did he blanch?&nbsp; Did he quail?&nbsp; Did he sue for peace?<br>
  Nay, not for a breath did his cursing cease.<br>
  On, on he fought till the Chamber floor<br>
  Was strewn with collars and coats and gore.<br>
  On, on they battled till, one by one,<br>
  His side went down to the low John Dunn.<br>
  Then scratched, and bleeding, and cut, and torn,<br>
  Brave Claude Legrand to the floor was borne.<br>
  And ten strong constables held him tight,<br>
  Then heaved him forth in the outer night...<br>
  And he who had come to the House that morn<br>
  Well-groomed, and tailored, and shaved, and shorn,<br>
  With a shiny hat, and a sleek black coat,<br>
  And a spotless collar around his throat,<br>
  Went, clothed in glory, and gore, and dirt,<br>
  And a pair of pants, and a tattered shirt....<br>
  Ah, such were the heroes who led the van<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In Parliament under the Party plan.</p>
<p>Yes, that is the story of Claude Legrand,<br>
  The leader of that last Liberal stand.<br>
  And through the ages his name shall ring<br>
  As the last of the Lashers, the Cursing King....<br>
  And you wonder, now that I&rsquo;m old and grey,<br>
  That I take no heed of affairs to-day.<br>
  You wonder why, in the Halls of State,<br>
  I find no joy in the dull debate.<br>
  &rsquo;Tis because my thoughts and my heart are there<br>
  In the days when a man defied the Chair;<br>
  In the days of valor and old Romance,<br>
  When a blow came quick on an angry glance;<br>
  When they cast them hither in threes and fours<br>
  &rsquo;Mid the Labor shrieks and the Lib&rsquo;ral roars;<br>

<p>A spieler came to Yarra Glen upon the Yarra flats;<br>
  He wore a suit of noisy cheeks and something cute in hats.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was a wicked man, they say,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as they grow down Melbourne way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A spieler gay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From Melbourne way,<br>
  Who sought for Yarra flats.</p>
<p>He taught them an amusing trick with three elusive cards;<br>
  But with suspicion such vain things the Yarra flat regards.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, with fingers mighty  quick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He tried them with the thimble  trick.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A nimble trick,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thimble trick,<br>
  As tricky as the cards.</p>
<p>But still the stolid natives stood, and let him have his say,<br>
  But always changed the subject when he wanted them to play.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were not parting with their  &ldquo;dough.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;But now,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;give <i>us</i> a show.<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The river trick,<br>
  The only trick we know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll bet you fifty pounds,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;that we produce a man<br>
  Who&rsquo;ll throw you clean across the river Yarra &mdash; and he can &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right where the stream is swift  and wide<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And land you on the other side.&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I call your bluff!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put up the stuff!&rdquo;<br>

<p>They led him to the river bank &mdash; the day was bleak and cold &mdash;<br>
  And on his collar and his pants their strong man took a hold.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He swung him once, he swung him  twice &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The strong man&rsquo;s grip was like  a vice) &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, with a flop,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He let him drop &mdash;<br>
  The stream was cold as ice.</p>
<p>The spieler scrambled to the bank.&nbsp;  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Get out!&rdquo; the simple natives jeered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our  strong man hasn&rsquo;t done.<br>

  &ldquo;These are,&rdquo; he murmured brokenly, &ldquo;the fliest flats I&rsquo;ve met.&rdquo;<br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheFirstElectiveMinistry"></a>The First Elective Ministry</b></h2>
<p>In the neolithic age of our Australia, long ago,<br>
  There dwelt a wise old chieftain, as you probably don&rsquo;t know;<br>
  His royal tastes and habits I won&rsquo;t venture to describe,<br>
  But his plain horse-sense was noted and applauded by his tribe.</p>
<p>Now, this chief was not a despot, as you will, perhaps, conclude;<br>
  For, though debate was noisy and procedure somewhat crude,<br>
  There did exist a Parliament, elected in due form,<br>
  With a Premier and Ministry &mdash; which made things pretty warm.</p>
<p>For the style of Party Government, in vogue about that time,<br>
  Was inclined to lead to discord &mdash; not to mention down-right crime.<br>
  For boomerangs and waddies were used freely in debate;<br>
  And, as a rule, ex-Ministers were spoken of as &ldquo;late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the salaries of Ministers were not to be despised;<br>
  And &ldquo;emoluments of office&rdquo; were, indeed, most highly prized.<br>
  The Premier got five &rsquo;possums and ten fat grubs a day,<br>
  While a snake and three gohannas were his colleagues&rsquo; daily pay.</p>
<p>Then other perks and privileges happened such as these;<br>
  The Minister controlling Rain and State Corroborees<br>
  Got all his ochre on the nod &mdash; in other words, his clothes.<br>
  So portfolios were coveted, as you may well suppose.</p>
<p>In consequence, the whole procedure of the House was &ldquo;fight.&rdquo;<br>
  No Ministry created in the morning saw the night.<br>
  And all the posts were sinecures the shorthand writers filled;<br>
  For the press-reports read briefly: &ldquo;Sixteen wounded; seven killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, the practical King Billy could not fail to recognise<br>
  That this bad old Party system was not either right or wise.<br>
  Public works were at a standstill, and the tribe was losing wealth.<br>
  Not to mention that the House&rsquo;s sittings menaced public health.</p>
<p>The Department of Smoke-Signalling was in a shocking state;<br>
  And Defence had been forgotten in the noise of the debate.<br>
  The Flint and  Sandstone Bonus Bill was shelved time and again;<br>
  And the tribe was getting very short of able-bodied men.</p>
<p>The commoon-sensed old chief sat down and pondered hard and long;<br>
  And thought him out a simple scheme to right this crying wrong.<br>
  Then he dissolved the Parliament and called his tribe around,<br>
  And told his plan; and all agreed his arguments were sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But then,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s most unconstitutional, you know.<br>
  Besides, we have no precedent; therefore you have no show.&rdquo;<br>
  But Bill dispensed with precedent and substituted sense &mdash;<br>
  Whereat the anger of the tribal Tories was immense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The nation&rsquo;s welfare,&rdquo; said the chief, &ldquo;is what I have in mind;<br>
  And this bad old Party Government must all be left behind.<br>
  Henceforth I set my Parliament a task it may not shirk,<br>
  And members will, please, understand that fighting isn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have Elective Ministries, and they shall rule unharmed<br>
  For forty moons; and members must attend the House unarmed.<br>
  Next election you may club them, should their actions prove unwise;<br>
  And for the second term the victors may enjoy the prize.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They called it &ldquo;socialistic&rdquo;; but King Billy had his way.<br>
  For forty moons each Minister enjoyed his place and pay.<br>
  Since only once within that time the chance of office came,<br>
  The members took to making laws, and ceased to &ldquo;play the game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peace and prosperity henceforth smiled on the chieftain&rsquo;s reign;<br>
  And, ere he died, he said, &ldquo;Behold, I have not ruled in vain.<br>
  Down through the future ages shall my Great reform descend.<br>
  Australia  shall bless my Simple Notion till the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, if you study recent history, you&rsquo;ll note King Bill<br>
  Was most forlornly out of it; for <i>they are at it still.</i><br>
  The daily fight for fatted grubs excites the same old gang;<br>
  And debate is mainly waddy, and division boomerang.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But poor ADAM&rsquo;S old contention<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has become a stock convention<br>
  &rsquo;Mid the ADAMS of the nations ever since,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Mid the shufflers and the  shirkers,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crusted Tory anti-workers,<br>
  They whom nought but &ldquo;precedent&rdquo; can e&rsquo;er convince.</p>
<p><i>They&rsquo;re the ADAMS of the race;  they&rsquo;re the men that clog the pace,<br>
  With their backs upon the vanguard and their eyes upon the rear;<br>
  Praising loud their point of view, and regarding owt that&rsquo;s new<br>
  With a rabid Tory hatred and a vague old-fashioned fear.<br>
  They&rsquo;re the men of yester-year loitering all needless here,<br>
  And meandering around and </i><i>&rsquo;round  in aimless, endless rings.<br>
    Ever ready to resent acts without a precedent,<br>
    Such as were not contemplated in the ancient scheme of things.</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;O, it was not  contemplated!&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the cry of the belated,<br>
  The complaint of all the Old Worlds waterlogged;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the trade-mark of the Tory;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis the declaration hoary;<br>
  &rsquo;Tis the protest of the busted and the bogged.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mark, whenever it is uttered &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the lips of ancients muttered,<br>
  There is wisdom lacking here, at any rate<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For, when Tories were created<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was never contemplated<br>
  That they ever would attempt to contemplate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are many things  decided,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quite by precedent unguided.<br>
  It was never contemplated, by the way.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the scheme of things was  shaping,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And mankind emerged from aping,<br>
  That he&rsquo;d ever learn to eat three times a day;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet, all precedent unheeding,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even Tories time their feeding,<br>
  And are known to be quite regular at meals;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though in neolithic ages<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas laid down by ancient sages<br>
  That a man shall eat when so inclined he feels.</p>
<p><i>He&rsquo;s the dead weight at the back; he&rsquo;s the log upon the track;<br>
  He&rsquo;s the man who shouts the warning when the danger&rsquo;s past and gone;<br>
  He&rsquo;s the prophet of the old by defunct traditions hold;<br>
  He&rsquo;s the chap who sits and twaddles while the crowd goes marching on.<br>
  Of the things uncontemplated in the councils of the dead;<br>
  But the nation marches by heedless of his bitter cry &mdash;<br>
  Marches on  and contemplates the vital things away ahead.</i> </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the shaping of a  nation<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can we crowd all contemplation &mdash;<br>
  Can we plan it in a hurried week or so?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cease your ancient whiskered story<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And observe, O gentle Tory,<br>
  <i>We are contemplating matters as we go.</i><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&rsquo;en to-day we&rsquo;re contemplating<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters princip&rsquo;ly relating<br>
  To the shaping of to-morrow&rsquo;s onward way;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to-morrow ev&rsquo;ry grafter<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will be forming plans for <i>after</i>;<br>
  But we are not harking back to yesterday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the future days  arranging;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeking, planning, ever changing;<br>
  Weeding out the old mistakes of yester-year;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Planting now the seed of new things<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;March the men who dare and do things,<br>
  Opening up the unblazed road without a fear.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, O mark you, gentle Tory,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall judge your measures hoary<br>
  By the use in this day&rsquo;s scheme they represent;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We shall use them if we want them;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If we don&rsquo;t we shall supplant them,<br>
  For we do not care a damn for precedent.</p>
<p><i>He&rsquo;s discretion at its worst; he a harbinger reversed;<br>
  He&rsquo;s the obstinate old party who abhors the new and strange.<br>
  He&rsquo;s the man whose ancient eyes ever fail to recognise<br>
  That the Law of Man was ever Change, and ever will be Change.<br>
  He&rsquo;s a scoffer at the Law; he&rsquo;s a blemish and a flaw;<br>
  And he whines as did old ADAM when he lost the realms of bliss.<br>
  When they shored him in the cold in the parlous days of old:</i><br>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMarch"></a>The March</b></h2>
<p>In&nbsp;early, prehistoric days, before the reign of Man,<br>
  When neolithic Nature fashioned things upon a plan<br>
  That was large as it was rugged, and, in truth, a trifle crude,<br>
  There arose a dusky human who was positively rude.</p>
<p>Now, this was in the days when lived the monster kangaroo;<br>
  When the mammoth bunyip gambolled in the hills of Beetaloo;<br>
  They&rsquo;d owned the land for centuries, and reckoned it their own;<br>
  For might was right, and such a thing as &ldquo;law&rdquo; was quite unknown.</p>
<p>But this dusky old reformer in the ages long ago,<br>
  One morning in the Eocene discovered how to &ldquo;throw&rdquo;;<br>
  He studied well and practised hard until he learned the art;<br>
  Then, having planned his Great Campaign, went forth to make a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said&mdash;and hurled a piece of tertiary rock,<br>
  That struck a Tory bunyip with a most unpleasant shock&mdash;<br>
  &ldquo;See here, my name is&nbsp;<i>Progress</i>, and your methods are too slow,<br>
  This land that you are fooling with&nbsp;<i>must be cut up</i>.&nbsp;Now&nbsp;<i>go!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gazed at him in wonder, then they slowly backed away;<br>
  For &ldquo;throwing&rdquo; things was novel in that neolithic day;<br>
  &rsquo;Twas the prehistoric &ldquo;argument,&rdquo; the first faint gleam of &ldquo;art.&rdquo;<br>
  Yet those mammoths seemed to take it in exceedingly bad part.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then a hoary, ag&eacute;d bunyip rose, and spluttered loud and long;<br>
  He said the black man&rsquo;s arguments were very,&nbsp;<i>very</i>&nbsp;wrong;<br>
  &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; he said, indignantly &ldquo;the land is ours by&nbsp;<i>right</i>,<br>
  And to seek to wrest it from us would be&mdash;well, most impolite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the savage shook his woolly head and smiled a savage smile,<br>
  And went on hurling prehistoric missiles all the while,<br>
  Till the bunyip and the others couldn&rsquo;t bear the argument,<br>
  And they said, &ldquo;You are a Socialist.&rdquo; But, all the same&mdash;they went.</p>
<p>Some centuries&mdash;or, maybe, it was &aelig;ons&mdash;later on,<br>
  When the bunyip and the mammoth kangaroo had passed and gone;<br>
  While the black man slowly profited by what his fathers saw,<br>
  While he learned to fashion weapons and establish tribal law.</p>
<p>There came a band of pale-faced men in ships, from oversea,<br>
  Who viewed the land, then shook their heads and sadly said, &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo;<br>
  Then they landed with some rum and Bibles and a gun or two,<br>
  And started out to &ldquo;civilize,&rdquo; as whites are apt to do.</p>
<p>They interviewed the black man and remarked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very sad,<br>
  But the use you make of this great land is positively bad;<br>
  Why, you haven&rsquo;t got a sheep or cow about the blessed place!<br>
  Considering the price of wool, it&rsquo;s simply a disgrace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they started with the Bibles and the rum&mdash;also the guns;<br>
  And some began to look for gold and others &ldquo;took up runs,&rdquo;<br>
  For, they said, &ldquo;This land&nbsp;<i>must be cut up</i>; it&rsquo;s simply useless so:<br>
  Our name is&nbsp;<i>Progress</i>, and you&rsquo;re out of date, so you must go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the black was most indignant, and he said it was a shame;<br>
  For&nbsp;<i>he&rsquo;d</i>&nbsp;been full and satisfied before the white man came,<br>
  And he used a word unpublishable in his argument,<br>
  Which is native for &ldquo;A blanky Buccaneer.&rdquo; And yet&mdash;<i>he</i>&nbsp;went.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the same old &ldquo;march unceasing.&rdquo; We are getting down the list,<br>
  And yesterday&rsquo;s &ldquo;Reformer&rdquo; is tomorrow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Monopolist,&rdquo;<br>
  For history&nbsp;<i>will</i>&nbsp;repeat itself in this annoying way:<br>
  Who stood for &ldquo;Progress&rdquo; yesterday is &ldquo;Retrograde&rdquo; to-day.</p>

<p>Now this is the ballad of Jeremy Jones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And likewise of Bobadil Brown,<br>
  Of the Snooks and the Snaggers and Macs and Malones,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And Diggle and Daggle and Down.<br>
  In fact, &rsquo;tis a song of a fatuous throng.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Which embraces &ldquo;the man in the street,&rdquo;<br>
  And the bloke on the &rsquo;bus, and a crowd more of us.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And a lot of the people we meet.</p>
<p>Yes, this is the story of Jack and of Jill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Whose surnames are Snawley or Smith,<br>
  And of Public Opinion and National Will,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And samples of Popular Myth.<br>
  For Jeremy Jones, as a very small boy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Was encouraged to struggle for pelf,<br>
  And to strive very hard in his own little yard,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But never to think for himself.</p>
<p><i>Then, Hi-diddle-diddle, the cat and the fiddle,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Come, sing us a nursery rhyme.<br>
  For, in spite of our whiskers, we elderly friskers<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Are kiddes the most of our time.<br>
  So this is the song of the juvenile throng,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And its aunts and its big brother  Bill,<br>
  Its uncles and cousins, and sisters in dozens,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Louisa and </i><i>&rsquo;Liza and Lill.</i> </p>
<p>Now, Jeremy Jones was exceedingly &ldquo;loyal,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And when any procession went by,<br>
  He&rsquo;d cheer very loud with the rest of the crowd,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Though he honestly couldn&rsquo;t tell why.<br>
  He was taught that his &ldquo;rulers&rdquo; toiled hard for his sake,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And promoted the &ldquo;general good&rdquo;;<br>
  That to meddle with &ldquo;customs&rdquo; was quite a mistake.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And Jones didn&rsquo;t see why he should.</p>
<p>To gird at the &ldquo;Order of Things as they Are,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He was told, was the act of a fool.<br>
  He was taught, in effect, to regard with respect<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ev&rsquo;ry&rsquo; &ldquo;Precedent,&rdquo; &ldquo;Practice&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rule.&rdquo;<br>
  And if we deserted the &ldquo;Usual Plan&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He believed that the nation would  fall.<br>
  So Jones became known as a &ldquo;right-thinking man,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Which meant that he didn&rsquo;t at all.</p>
<p><i>Oh, Little Miss Muffett, she sat on a tuffet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But fled from a spider in fright;<br>
  For no one had told her that if she was bolder,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; She might have asserted her right.<br>
  Ho, rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On a sea of political doubt;<br>
  And they argue together concerning the weather,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; But never attempt to get out.</i> </p>
<p>They made him a grocer when Jerry left school,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And a very good grocer was he;<br>
  And a dunce he was not, for he knew quite a lot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Of such matters as treacle and tea.<br>
  But the making of nations, and things so immense,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He considered beyond his control.<br>
  He was busy on week-days at saving his pence,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And on Sundays at saving his soul.</p>
<p>But politics Jones did not wholly neglect!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He subscribed to a paper, THE SAGE;<br>
  And every morn, with becoming respect,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; He scanned its political page.<br>
  He believed what was said in each leader he read,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; For a &ldquo;right-thinking person&rdquo; was he.<br>
  Who was shocked at their vices, who growled of the prices<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sugar or treacle or tea.</p>
<p><i>Oh, Little Jack Horner sits in a corner,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A look of delight in his eye,<br>
  At the sight of a plum on the end of his thumb,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; While there&rsquo;s somebody sneaking his  pie.<br>
  Then, ride a cock hoss to Banbury Cross &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Though the Lord only knows why we do.<br>
  But there&rsquo;s precedent for it, and those who ignore it<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; We class as an ignorant crew,</i> </p>
<p>So Jeremy Jones he meanders through life,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Behaving as Grandmother bids;<br>
  And so do his very respectable wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And extremely conventional kids.<br>
  Their bosses can trust &rsquo;em, for habit and custom<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; They&rsquo;ve learnt in the regular school;<br>
  And they call him &ldquo;right-thinking,&rdquo; while privately winking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And setting him down as a fool.</p>
<p>Convention&rsquo;s his master; he vows that disaster<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Will swiftly encompass its foes.<br>
  He thinks Evolution a Labor delusion,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And &ldquo;Progress&rdquo; a &ldquo;something&rsquo; that  grows.<br>
  He&rsquo;s one of the many &mdash; a credulous zany &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; The leadable, bleedable type &mdash;<br>
  Who looks upon &ldquo;Time&rdquo; &mdash; instructed by Granny &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; As something that rarely is ripe.</p>
<p><i>Oh, Goosey, goose gander, where do you wander?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Only, kind sir, where I&rsquo;m told;<br>
  For my master has said I must go where I&rsquo;m led,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And to contradict him would be bold.<br>
  And Little Bo-peep she lost her sheep.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the Socialist&rsquo;s fault, she&rsquo;ll  insist.<br>
  But leave her to grieve, for she&rsquo;ll never believe<br>

<p>Then this is the ballad of elderly kids,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Of Jeremy Jones and his kind,<br>
  Of Bobadil Brown, and Daggle and Down,<br>

  Oh, this is a song of the National Will,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Of the Snooks, and the Snaggers, and  Smiths,<br>
  Their aunts and their cousins, and big brother Bill,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Convention and Popular Myths.</p>
<p>A sad little song of the fatuous throng,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; A string of sedate little rhymes,<br>
  Concerning the crowd who consider it wrong<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To collide with the &ldquo;trend of the  times.&rdquo;<br>
  A song about Us, who are missing the &rsquo;bus,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; While we trifle and toy with pretence.<br>

<p>Now, a visitor from somewhere right outside this Mundane Ball &mdash;<br>
  Do not ask me where he came from, for that point&rsquo;s not clear at all;<br>
  For he might have been an angel, or he might have come from Mars,<br>
  Or from any of the other of the fixed or unfixed stars.<br>
  As regards his mental make-up he was much like you or me;<br>
  And he toured about the country, just to see what he could see.</p>
<p>Well, this superhuman person was of most inquiring mind,<br>
  And &rsquo;twas noted, from his questions, he was very far from blind,<br>
  And the striking thing about him was his stern, compelling eye,<br>
  That demanded Truth ungarbled when he paused for a reply.<br>
  And, despite the mental wriggles of the folk he interviewed,<br>
  When they placed the Truth before him she was ab-so-lutely nude.</p>
<p>At our Civilised Society he stared in some amaze,<br>
  As he muttered his equivalent for &ldquo;Gosh!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Spare me days!&rdquo;<br>
  For our cherished modes and customs knocked him sideways, so to speak.<br>
  &ldquo;To solve,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this mystery, now whither shall I seek?<br>
  For a sane and sound solution I must question those on high,&rdquo;<br>
  Said this extra-mundane being with the stern, compelling eye.</p>
<p>Now, his methods were intelligent &mdash; I confess,<br>
  For he started with our Politics, religion and the Press.<br>
  Thus, he read a morning paper through, intently, ev&rsquo;ry leaf,<br>
  Then hied him out to interview the editor-in-chief:<br>
  &ldquo;They say that Truth lives in a well,&rdquo; he muttered as he went;<br>
  &ldquo;But her well is not an inkwell, I will lay my last lone cent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It chanced he found the editor unguarded and alone<br>
  At the office of the paper &mdash; &rsquo;twas the MORNING MEGAPHONE.<br>
  &ldquo;Now, I take it,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;you represent the Press,<br>
  That great Public Educator?&rdquo;&nbsp; And the  pressman murmured, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<br>
  &ldquo;Yet in yesterday&rsquo;s edition I perceived a glaring lie!<br>
  How&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;&nbsp; He fixed the pressman with  his stern, compelling eye.</p>
<p>Then the editor he stammered, and the editor he &ldquo;hemmed&rdquo;<br>
  And muttered things like &ldquo;Gracious me!&rdquo; and likewise, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m demned!&rdquo;<br>
  But the lady Truth came tripping, all undressed and unashamed;<br>
  &ldquo;Oh, I own it!&rdquo; cried the editor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But  how can I be blamed?<br>
  There&rsquo;s our blighted advertisers and our readers &mdash; Spare my grief!<br>
  But <i>we&rsquo;ve got to please the public!</i>&rdquo; moaned the editor-in-chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to interview a statesman and consider his reply,&rdquo;<br>
  Said this strange Select Committee with the stern, compelling eye.<br>
  And the Honorable Member for Mud Flat he chanced to find<br>
  In a noble Spring-street building of a most palatial kind.<br>
  And the Honorable Member viewed his visitor with awe,<br>
  For he surely had the most compelling eye you ever saw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, tell me,&rdquo; said the visitor; &ldquo;you are a man of State,<br>
  And you blither on the platform of this Nation grand and great;<br>
  Of this noble Land&rsquo;s great destiny I&rsquo;ve heard you talking hard,<br>
  But, whene&rsquo;er it comes to voting, it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;claims&rsquo; of your back yard.<br>
  Do you represent the Nation, as you often say you do,<br>
  Or a hen-roost or a cow-yard, or a parish-pump or two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the politician stuttered, and the politician stared,<br>
  But to voice his patriotic platitudes he felt too scared;<br>
  For the lady Truth insisted, and he blurted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Votes!<br>
  You must blame the dashed electors when you see us turn our coats!<br>
  Our constituents control us.&nbsp; You must  please remember that.<br>
  And <i>we&rsquo;ve got to please the public!</i>&rdquo; whined the Member for Mud Flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to look into religion,&rdquo; said the visitor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m told<br>
  I may get much information from a Wowser-of-the-Fold.&rdquo;<br>
  And he sought him out a Wowser of the very sternest breed:<br>
  &ldquo;Sweet Charity, they tell me, is the keynote of your creed.<br>
  And of mercy for the sinner, and of succor for the weak.<br>
  From the pulpit, on a Sunday, I have often heard you speak;<br>
  Yet Charity is turned to Spite, and Scorn becomes your creed<br>
  When they speak of giving bounty to weak Magadalene in need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the Wowser hesitated, and the Wowser rolled his eyes,<br>
  And sought in vain to call to mind some Wowserish replies.<br>
  But the lady truth came peeping, and the Wowser cried, &ldquo;O, Lor!&rdquo;<br>
  And he hastily drew the blind and softly closed the door.<br>
  &ldquo;She is naked!&rdquo; gasped the Wowser.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,  where are the hussy&rsquo;s clothes?<br>
  If my dear brethren saw me now!&nbsp; Oh, what  do you suppose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Truth!&rdquo; exclaimed the querist with the stern, compelling eye.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis my flock!&rdquo; exclaimed the Wowser.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,  I cannot tell a lie!<br>
  My flock of virgins sour and chaste, and matrons undeceived,<br>
  They would hound me from the pulpit if I said what I believed!<br>
  I dot on notoriety!&nbsp; The Truth it must be  told.<br>
  Oh, <i>I&rsquo;ve got to please my public!</i>&rdquo; moaned the Wowser-of-the-Fold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, this Public; I must nail it,&rdquo; said the queer Inquisitor.<br>
  &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the favor of this mighty god they all seem eager for;<br>
  And they always strive to please him, and his sentiments express<br>
  In their Parliaments and Pulpits and their organs of the Press.<br>
  And I&rsquo;ll get a sure solution if I have the luck to meet &mdash;<br>
  What is this he&rsquo;s called? &mdash; the Man, or Bloque, or Fellow-in-the-Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A Fellow-in-the-Street was found, and typical was he,<br>
  An eager hunter of the thing that men call &pound;. s. d.<br>
  He wore a strained expression on his features, dull and flat,<br>
  Also bifurcated coat-tails, and a little hard round hat.<br>
  His talk was mainly platitutdes, when it wasn&rsquo;t shop or horse,<br>
  And he had some fixed opinions and a bank account, of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, tell me,&rdquo; said the visitant,&nbsp; &ldquo;What are your private views<br>
  On your Politics, Religion and the Sheet that gives you news?<br>
  I have heard a lot about you, and a deal I&rsquo;d like to know<br>
  Of why you work, and what you think, and where you hope to go.<br>
  I feel assured that I shall find the Truth in your reply.&rdquo;<br>
  And he fixed the foolish Fellow with his stern, compelling eye.</p>
<p>The Fellow hemmed and hawed a bit, the Fellow looked about,<br>
  And the lady Truth smiled sweetly while he murmured, as in doubt.<br>
  &ldquo;Well, re-al-ly, my views upon those things I can&rsquo;t express.<br>
  You must ask our Politicians and the Parsons and the Press.<br>
  But as for me &mdash; well, candidly, you&rsquo;ve got me off my beat;<br>
  For <i>I don&rsquo;t know much about it!</i>&rdquo; said the Fellow-in-the-Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>&rsquo;Tis the Circle!</i>&rdquo; cried the visitor.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis the same old crazy game<br>
  Right through the trackless Milky Way to there from whence I came.<br>
  The Earth is round, the Moon is round, and Jupiter and Mars,<br>
  Their orbit&rsquo;s all, and Saturn&rsquo;s rings, and countless million stars.<br>
  All throughout the constellations I have journeyed, to and fro,<br>
  But ev&rsquo;rything goes round and round no matter where I go.<br>
  All the Universe is circles!&nbsp; All one  tantalising twirl!<br>
  <i>Oh, is there nothing straight or square in all this cosmic whirl?</i></p>
<p>And with these strange and cryptic words the Being fled afar,<br>
  Back to his native hiding-place &mdash; his fixed or unfixed star.<br>
  Some say his name was &ldquo;Reason,&rdquo; other hold &rsquo;twas &ldquo;Intellect&rdquo;:<br>
  But as for me I have no views to voice in that respect.<br>
  His motives seemed mysterious; I know not how nor why;<br>
  I only know he had a stern and most compelling eye.</p>

<p>Light of my lives! Is the time not yet?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Lo, I&rsquo;ve brooded on a star<br>
  Through many a year, with the hope held dear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; That, in some future far,<br>
  I would know the joy of a love returned.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Are my lives lived vainly, all,<br>
  Since that cosmic morn when life, new-born,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; First moved on this mundane ball?</p>
<p>Yea, I mind it yet, when first we met<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; On a tertiary rock,<br>
  Flow the graceful charm of your rudiments<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Imparted love&rsquo;s first shock.<br>
  But I was a mere organic cell<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; In that early Eocene,<br>
  While you were a prim, primordial germ,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the mother of protogene.</p>
<p>So I loved and died, and the ages sped<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Till the time of my second birth;<br>
  When I took my place in the cosmic race,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And again came down to earth.<br>
  Once more we met.&nbsp; Ah, love, not yet!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; You were far above my state!<br>
  For how could I raise my mollusc gaze<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To a virtuous vertebrate?</p>
<p>Again we died, and again we slept,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And again we came to be &mdash;<br>
  I as an anthropoidal ape,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And you as a chimpanzee.<br>
  You as a charming chimpanzee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; With a high, patrician air;<br>
  And I watched you waltz from tree to tree<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; As I slunk in my lowly lair.</p>
<p>And yet again, in an age or so,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; We met, and I mind the sob<br>
  I sobbed when I found that I was&mdash;what?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And you were a thingumbob.<br>
  You had sold your tail for a kind of soul,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; You had grown two thumbs beside;<br>
  And I knew again that my love was vain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; So I went to the woods and died.</p>
<p>As a humble homunculus, later on,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; I crept to your cave at night,<br>
  And howled long, love-lorn howls in vain<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; To my lady troglodyte.<br>
  And I grew insane at your cold disdain,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And my howlings filled the place,<br>
  Till your father sought me out one night,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And&mdash;again I yearned in space.</p>
<p>Then, light of my lives!&nbsp; Is the time not yet?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Say, in what distant life &mdash;<br>
  In what dim age that is still to come<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; May I win and call you wife?<br>
  Still high above!&nbsp; My love, my love!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Nay, how can I raise my eyes<br>
  To you, my star of the Eocene,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; My ever elusive prize?</p>
<p>Lo, Time speeds on, and the suns grow cold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And the earth infirm and hoar,<br>
  And, ages past, we are here at last &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ay, both on the earth once more.<br>
  But, alas, dear heart, as far apart<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; As e&rsquo;er in this cosmic whirl;<br>
  For I&rsquo;m but a lowly writer-man<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; And you are a tea-room girl.</p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&rsquo;d think, to hear them talking,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each upheld the people&rsquo;s right.<br>
  Each declared he stood for Progress and against his country&rsquo;s foes<br>
  When he sought their votes at Wombat, where the Muddy River flows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter Dawking, scorning party,<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Jones, loud, blatant, hearty,<br>

  But the electors up at Wombat vowed to him alone they&rsquo;d stick<br>
  Who would give his sacred promise for the &ldquo;bridge across the crick&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bland, unfaithful politicians<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long had said this bridge should be.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some soared on to high positions,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some sank to obscurity;<br>
  Still the bridge had been denied it by its unrelenting foes&mdash;<br>
  By the foes of patient Wombat, where the Muddy River flows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up at Wombat Peter Dawking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Held a meeting in the hall,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he&rsquo;d spent an hour in talking<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the far-flung Empire&rsquo;s Call,<br>
  When a local greybeard, rising, smote him with this verbal brick:<br>
  &ldquo;Are or are yeh not in favour of the bridge across the crick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Peter just ignored the question,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proudly patriotic man;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Understand a mean suggestion<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Men like Peter never can,<br>
  Or that free enlightened voters look on all Great Things as rot,<br>
  While a Burning Local Question fires each local patriot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Jones, serene and smiling,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took all Wombat to his heart.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, his &ldquo;blood was b&rsquo;iling&rdquo;&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He declared it &ldquo;made him smart&rdquo;<br>
  To reflect how they&rsquo;d been swindled; and he cried in ringing tones<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the great election night<br>
  They stood level in the voting, and the hope of friends and foes<br>
  Hung upon the box from Wombat, where the Muddy River flows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Wombat votes were counted;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones, two hundred; Dawking, three!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph, proud and smiling, mounted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a public balcony,<br>
  And his friends were shrill with triumph, for that contest, shrewdly run,<br>
  In the House gave Jones&rsquo;s Party a majority of one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jones&rsquo;s Party&mdash;note the sequel&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules that country of the Free,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the fight, so nearly equal,<br>

  And the Big Things of the Nation are delayed till Hope grows sick&mdash;<br>
  Offered up as sacrifices to &ldquo;the bridge across the crick&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Poor remnant he of a conquered race,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long shorn of its power and pride,<br>
  No reverence shone in his sullen face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they told how that race had died.<br>
  But the meed that he gave to his father&rsquo;s name<br>
  Was a down-drooped head and a flush of shame.</p>
<p>Oh, the Fool had reigned full many a year<br>
  In the Land of the Bounteous Gifts,<br>
  Dreaming and drifting, with never a fear,<br>
  As a doomed fool pleasantly drifts;<br>
  And he ate his fill of the gifts she gave&mdash;<br>
  The Fool who was sire of a hopeless Slave.</p>
<p>Year by year as his harvest grew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He gleaned with a lightsome heart;<br>
  His barns he filled, and he sowed and tilled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trading in port and mart.<br>
  Proud of his prowess in sport and trade<br>
  Was the Fool, who scoffed at an alien raid.</p>
<p>Little he recked of the gathering cloud<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That boded a swift disgrace.<br>
  Was he not seed of a manly breed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud son of a warlike race?<br>
  And he told of the deeds that his sires had done&mdash;<br>
  While he wielded a bat in the place of a gun.</p>
<p>Small were his fears in the rich fat years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loud was his laugh of scorn<br>
  When they whispered low of a watching foe,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greedy for gold and corn;<br>
  A foe grown jealous of trade an power,<br>
  Marking the treasure, and waiting the hour.</p>
<p>And, e&rsquo;en when the smoke of the raiders&rsquo; ships<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trailed out o&rsquo;er the northern skies,<br>
  His laugh was loud: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis a summer cloud,&rdquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said the Fool in his Paradise.<br>
  And, to guard his honor, he gave a gun<br>
  To the feeble hands of his younger son.</p>
<p>Oh, a startled Fool, and a Fool in haste<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Awoke on a later day,<br>
  When they sped the word that a foe laid waste<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ports by the smiling bay,<br>
  And his voice was shrill as he bade his sons<br>
  Haste out to the sound of the booming guns.</p>
<p>And scarce had he raised his rallying cry,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scarce had he called one note,<br>
  When he died, as ever a fool must die,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his war-song still in his throat.<br>
  And an open ditch was the hasty grave<br>
  Of the Fool who fathered a hopeless Slave.</p>
<p>They point the moral, they tell the tale,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the old world wags its head:<br>
  &ldquo;If a Fool hath treasure, and Might prevail,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the Fool must die,&rdquo; &rsquo;tis said.<br>
  And the end of it all is a broken gun<br>

  Ai do deserve some gratitude from Paw.<br>
  To think what Ai&rsquo;ve gone thro&rsquo; foah him to-day!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixing with the lowah classes&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Ai never saw such masses<br>
  Of disreputable creatuahs, Ai must say.<br>
  Imposters, Ai&rsquo;ve no doubt, if most of them were but unmasked.<br>
  And then, the most humiliating questions Ai was asked!</p>
<p>Yes, he forced me to admit it was foah Paw.<br>
  Asked me, brutally, if it was foah mai Paw.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some low-bred official fellow,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who conversed in quaite a bellow,<br>
  And he patronised me laike a high Bashaw.<br>
  And his questions, rudely personal, Ai hardly could enduah.<br>
  The Government should teach its people mannahs, Ai am suah!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haw!<br>
  Ai&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;ve got the pension foah Pooah Paw.<br>
  His maintenance has been&mdash;O, such a strain.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ouah establishment&rsquo;s extensive<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And exceedingly expensive,<br>
  As mai husband has remawked taime and again.<br>
  It&rsquo;s quaite a miracle how Ai contrive to dress at all.<br>
  He cut me dahn to twenty guineas for last Mayoral Ball!</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s such a boah to hev to think of Paw&mdash;<br>
  To hev a secret skeleton laike Paw.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paw, you know, was once a diggah,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he cuts no social figgah.<br>
  And his mannahs! O, they touch us on the raw.<br>
  Of course, we&rsquo;re very fond of him, and all thet sort of thing;<br>
  But we couldn&rsquo;t hev him&mdash;could we?&mdash;when theah&rsquo;s naice folk visiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haw!<br>
  It&rsquo;s cost us pawnds and pawnds to care foah Paw.<br>
  And then, it is so hard to keep him dawk.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, no later then last Mond&rsquo;y,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ai was out with Lady Grundy,<br>
  When we ran raight into him outsaide the Pawk.<br>
  Goodness knows!&nbsp; Ai managed, somehow, to elude him with a nod,<br>
  And Ai said he was a tradesman; but she must hev thought it odd.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t picture the ubiquity of Paw,<br>
  And he&rsquo;s really very obstinate, is Paw.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, he held to the contention<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That this most convenient pension<br>
  Was a thing he hadn&rsquo;t any raight to draw!<br>
  He said we&rsquo;d kept him eighteen months, and ought to keep him yet.<br>
  But mai husband soon convinced him that he couldn&rsquo;t count on thet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Haw!<br>
  He was a pioneah, you know, mai Paw.<br>
  But of mai early laife Ai never tell.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paw worked, as Ai hev stated;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he had us educated;<br>
  And, later on, Ai married rather well.<br>
  And then, you know, deah Paw became&mdash;er&mdash;well, embarrassing.<br>
  For he is so unconventional and&mdash;all thet sort of thing.</p>
<p>But the Government has taken ovah Paw.<br>
  We are happy now we&rsquo;ve aisolated Paw.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a bettah era&rsquo;s dawning,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For mai husband said this mawning<br>
  Thet the money saved would buy a motah-caw.<br>
  Paw was so good to us when we were young, that, you&rsquo;ll allow,<br>
It&rsquo;s really taime the Government did something foah him now.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="BrownsTram"></a>Brown&rsquo;s Tram</b></h2>
<p>A city clerk was Henry Brown,<br>
  Whose suburb knew nor tram nor train;<br>
  And ev&rsquo;ry morn he walked to town.</p>
<p>From nine till five, with busy brain,<br>
  He labored in an office dim.<br>
  Each eve he walked out home again.</p>
<p>And all this tramping seemed to him<br>
  A waste of time, for, &rsquo;mid the strife,<br>
  He could not keep his lawn in trim.</p>
<p>It clouded his domestic life &mdash;<br>
  This going early, coming late &mdash;<br>
  And much distressed his little wife.</p>
<p>Then some wise man declared the State<br>
  Should put in trams, and for this scheme<br>
  Brown was a red-hot advocate.</p>
<p>At last he realised his dream;<br>
  And daily in and out of town<br>
  He trammed it with content supreme.</p>
<p>For, though it cost him half-a-crown<br>
  A week in fares, the time he saved<br>
  Meant much to him and Mrs. Brown.</p>
<p>And so they lived and pinched and slaved<br>
  And their suburban happiness<br>
  Seemed all that they had ever craved.</p>
<p>The little wife began to bless<br>
  The trams; nor grieved their meagre dole<br>
  Was weekly two and sixpence less.</p>
<p>Then Brown&rsquo;s employer, kindly soul,<br>
  Learned of this tram-car luxury,<br>
  And promptly rose to take his toll.</p>
<p>He sent for Brown and said that he<br>
  Should now contrive to come at eight<br>
  Since trams blessed his vicinity.</p>
<p>He also deemed it wise to state<br>
  That idleness begat much ill,<br>
  And it was wrong to sleep in late.</p>
<p>Yet Brown contrived to tram it still,<br>
  And trim his lawn with tender care,<br>
  And pay his rent and baker&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>His little wife vowed it unfair;<br>
  But bowed to stern, relentless fate,<br>
  And smiled and sewed and worked her share.</p>
<p>Just here, the landlord wrote to state,<br>
  Since trams improved his property,<br>
  He&rsquo;d raise the rent as from that date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three shillings weekly will not be<br>
  Too much&mdash;an equitable rise,<br>
  Considering the trams,&rdquo; wrote he.</p>
<p>What profit oaths or women&rsquo;s sighs?<br>
  His &ldquo;sacred rights,&rdquo; of wealth the fount,<br>
  A landlord has to recognise.</p>
<p>To what do poor clerks&rsquo; lives amount?<br>
  An extra hour of slavery<br>
  Swells an employer&rsquo;s bank account.</p>
<p>The wealthy boss thanks God that he<br>
  Has saved some money out of Brown.<br>
  The landlord smiles contentedly.</p>
<p>The trams run gaily up and down,<br>
  A sight Brown sadly notes as he<br>
  Plods daily in and out of town.</p>
