<p>&ldquo;No,  I can&rsquo;t say that I ever had but one exciting trip,&rdquo; replied the first mate to  my question, as he puffed at his cigar and glanced aloft amongst the shadows,  where yawned the dusky hollows of rigid sails, piling up towards the stars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  twenty-five years now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;since I first went to sea, and, with  that one exception, all my voyages have been pretty well the same old record of  gales and calms, with, at intervals, the loss of a few spars or sails to vary  the monotony. No, I haven&rsquo;t even been wrecked. But the affair I mentioned had  fun enough, of a sort, to last one right through. I don&rsquo;t hanker after any more  of the same quality, I can assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  the chief officer of one of the biggest of the &ldquo;City&rdquo; liners laughed as he got  off the skylight, and took a look first into the binnacle and then at the  sinuous phosphorescent track which the vessel left behind as she tore along to  the steady hum of the south-east Trades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  if you like, I&rsquo;ll tell you about it,&rdquo; said he, returning to my side. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll  help to pass the watch away.&rdquo; And, settling himself comfortably, the chief  began&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was just out of my time, and had got through my exam, for second mate all  right. But I discovered that getting a billet as such was a very different  matter. Tired at last of hawking my brand-new certificate about, I decided to  take the first thing that offered. You see, funds were so low that I had to do  like many more just then&mdash;pocket my dignity. Well, I went up to Tower-hill and  had a look round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  place was full of men, and presently out of the shipping-master&rsquo;s office came  the heaviest sea-swell I ever clapped eyes on.</p>
<p>Black  frock-coat, white waistcoat, bell-topper, patent leather boots, slate-coloured  kid gloves; and, to crown all, he carried a gold-mounted cane, and sported a flower  in his buttonhole. He was a tall, handsome fellow of about six or seven and  twenty, and the very look of him seemed to brighten up the dirty old hole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lighting  a cigar, he gave a sharp glance over the crowd and spoke to a few of them,  whilst the rest stared with all their eyes at this dashing specimen of a  skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently,  coming to me, he asked me whether I wanted a ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I said I did, and, from mere force of habit, lugged out my unsoiled  ticket. But at sight of it he shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo;  said he, &lsquo;foremast hands I want. Young and smart, English or Scotch&mdash;steam &mdash;Guam in ballast. Five pounds a month, and a bonus every  trip.&rsquo; And he eyed me as much as to say, &lsquo;You might do worse, in spite of that  bit of parchment,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought so, anyhow. The wages were double those going at the time. Certainly, I  had never been in a steamer. But he said that was no matter. So I signed, and  took a month&rsquo;s advance&mdash;not as I expected, in the shape of a note, but in gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s  no use,&rsquo; I heard him say to the shipping-master as I came out. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t get the  men I want here. Three-parts of those fellows are foreigners, and the other  part Irish. Very good sailors, I daresay. But they won&rsquo;t suit me. I may be able  to pick up a few more at Plymouth or Penzance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hailing  a cab, and calling at Green&rsquo;s Home for my dunnage, I drove to the Southwest  India docks, where the <i>Tallahassee</i> was  lying. She was a lovely model of a ship for a steamer. But it seemed a pity  that in place of the couple of light poles that served as an excuse for a  fore-and-aft rig, heavy masts and square yards shouldn&rsquo;t spring aloft. She  would have made a beautiful brig. I never did like steamers, and, to my fancy,  it was simply spoiling such a hull to shove a screw in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  struck me as curious was that everything&mdash;spars, hull, ironwork, and all&mdash;was  painted a dull grey. Capstans and gratings, even&mdash;things that are invariably  left &lsquo;bright&rsquo;&mdash;bore the same sober hue. Nor was there a scrap of brasswork about  her decks. Shine the sun never so hotly, he would find nothing upon the <i>Tallahassee</i> to strike a reflection off. The fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle was fitted up like the skipper&mdash; A1.  Curtains before each bunk, lockers, cupboards, brackets for clothes, a big  brass-mounted swing-lamp to burn oil; and, if you&rsquo;ll believe me, a life-belt  for every man hanging on the bulkhead dividing the port and starboard watches.  A staircase with ornamental iron railing led down into this palace&mdash;for such it  was in those days, and I don&rsquo;t know that it would be easy to beat now. The fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle  was full of seamen, all wondering and examining things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody  knew where &lsquo;Guam&rsquo; was. But everybody had heard  of it as a port of clearance for ships whose destination, for some reason, the  owners wished to conceal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  were no old hands on board, as sometimes happens, to give new-comers the run of  the ropes. Presently, however, a fireman came along and told us he had heard  that the skipper owned her; that he bought her as a sailing ship, and converted  her into a steamer. But he knew nothing about Guam.  All he was certain of was that her engines were the most powerful he had ever  seen, and that when they were at their top we should know it. They were big  enough, he reckoned, for a ship six times her size, and ought to drive her&mdash;if  she&rsquo;d stand it&mdash;a good seventeen or eighteen knots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning we steamed slowly  down the river. The day was dull, with a misty rain, and the ship glided  through the water like a ghost&mdash;a grey one. What strengthened the notion was that  no smoke issued from the great funnel. They were burning anthracite in the  furnaces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  more suspicious-looking craft, I thought, as I noticed how she sneaked along  noiselessly, with the engines scarcely turning, and wound around and about the  shipping almost unperceived, never sailed out of the port of London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the Channel we overhauled one of the squadron, going the same way as ourselves,  and as fast as she could. That we excited her curiosity was clear by the style  in which the naval officers piped us from the bridge, and man-o&rsquo;-war Jack from  the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle. I expect they wondered what was the business of the long, grey,  smokeless flyer that, with her engines at less than half-speed, passed them as  if H.M.S. was lying snugly at anchor.</p>
<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Open  their eyes more if they knew what we were after,&rsquo; I heard the skipper say to  the mate, as they stood beside me on the bridge, and they laughed. They were  brothers these two, and as much alike as twins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Passing  all the more important towns, we presently sneaked into a little place called  Fowey, and there shipped four more hands, making our complement up to twenty,  all A.B.&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a steamer of some 800 tons or so wanted with such a crowd rather puzzled us.  But there was nothing to be learned aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  three engineers were as big swells as the skipper and his two mates, the second  of whom had been chief of a P. &amp; O. boat. The bo&rsquo;sun was an old man-o&rsquo;-war&rsquo;s  man, and as tight as wax. There were no boys to tattle and carry yarns, and the  cooks and stewards were apparently as wise as ourselves. There was a notion for&rsquo;ard  that we were bound for the South Seas on a  kidnapping expedition; and, I fancy, if they had got the chance, some of the  crew would have slipped her at Fowey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,  early next day, with the Cornish land close aboard, a fine smooth sea, and lots  of red-sailed trawlers around us, the bo&rsquo;sun&rsquo;s pipe was heard calling all hands  to muster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  skipper and his mates were on the quarter-deck, and when we were all ranged up,  the former said, &lsquo;Now, my lads, I&rsquo;ve thought it best, before going any farther,  to let you know the purpose of this trip. Then, if any man doesn&rsquo;t like it, I&rsquo;ll  pay his passage ashore in one of those smacks, and give him a couple of pounds  to carry him to London.  On the other hand, those who stay will get a bonus of three pounds per head per  month, bringing the wages up to eight pounds.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Well,&rsquo;  he continued, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re going to try and run the blockade into a Southern port  with arms and ammunition for the Confederate Government. I don&rsquo;t say that there  won&rsquo;t be some danger in the undertaking. Doubtless there  will be. And that&rsquo;s the reason why I wish no man to go into it blindfold. I  might, of course, have told you before, but at the risk of the secret leaking  out, and having the ship stopped. Now the men for the shore will please walk  over to port.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  a few minutes there was a dead silence. We were all young able fellows, and  there wasn&rsquo;t a married man amongst us. None knew precisely what  blockade-running meant, nor what risks were attached to the process, nor did  anyone apparently feel inclined to inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  manly way in which the skipper spoke, and the handsome features and commanding  presence of himself and his brother, added to the kind and considerate  treatment already experienced on board the <i>Tallahassee</i>,  were, however, not without effect, and not a soul stirred,</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  presently somebody, taking off his cap, called for three cheers for Captain  Warrington. These were given heartily, and another round for his brother.  Whereupon, looking pleased, the skipper thanked us, hoped we might have a lucky  run, and called the steward to splice the mainbrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  time went on we learned a little more. Both the captain and his brother were  natives of the Southern States&mdash;now at deadly feud with the North. Both had been  bred to the sea, and held commissions in the Federal navy, and both at the  first outbreak of hostilities had given Uncle Sam best. And as, just then, the  Confederacy had no ships worth mentioning, they thought they could best serve  its interests by purchasing and equipping the <i>Tallahassee</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,  good Lord, how that grey witch of a thing did fly over the three thousand odd  miles of North Atlantic between the Lizard and Cat Cay, in the Bahamas, which, it appeared, was our &lsquo;Guam&rsquo;!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  sent her, and no mistake! It was like being on an express train going fifty  miles an hour on the narrow gauge. Shivering and creaking in every timber and  iron of her composite body, with the big engines thundering away night and day,  they drove her through weather that would have forced a battle-ship to lie-to.  With everything securely lashed and battened, and life-lines fore and aft her  flush deck, she cut through the water, half the time nearly under it, so to  speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  Cat Cay we found a regular depot full of cargo and fuel waiting for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throwing  our ballast overboard, we replaced it with cases of rifles, swords, bayonets,  and some big guns. On top of these again we stacked hundreds of kegs of powder  and boxes of cartridges, until the <i>Tallahassee</i> sat pretty low in the water, and the engineers expressed themselves satisfied  that the engines wouldn&rsquo;t &lsquo;race,&rsquo; as they had done at times coming out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never heard for certain where all the stuff came from, but there was a lump of  a cargo-steamer arrived with a fresh supply as we left, and they said she was  from Bermuda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our  destination was a place at the mouth of the Altameha  River&mdash;I forget its name just now&mdash;so we  steamed cautiously north about, hold and bunkers alike full, knowing that  Federal cruisers were keeping a sharp look-out for just such customers as the <i>Tallahassee</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure  enough, the night we made the land we also sighted four men-o&rsquo;-war cruising off  the very harbour we wanted to get into, and almost as if they had known we were  coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,  the skipper seemed rather pleased than otherwise. He was one of those people  who feel quite vexed if they put a job through all plain and easy and without  any bother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  blockaders never noticed the grey speck away in the offing, and at sundown we  sneaked slowly in at about the rate of a snail&rsquo;s gallop. It was pitch dark&mdash;not  a star, even. The leadsman gave the depths in a whisper, and people trod  softly, mindful that a wandering shell might send us all to kingdom come. Every  light was dowsed, and even the ship&rsquo;s bells were muffled in old socks. We were  beginning to realise in a small way what blockade-running meant. Creeping along  through a regular blind man&rsquo;s holiday, and making as much noise as an eel, with  all hands on deck, their eyes skinned and ears laid back, we got a start. I can&rsquo;t  say how it affected the others; it was too dark to see. But I know I jumped a  good foot high, and my heart felt as if it was in my mouth,&mdash;when suddenly from  above us came a bugle call, clear and low, followed by a slight rattle of arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  was followed by the sound of voices, so near, apparently, that we might have  touched the speakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Astern-easy!&rsquo;  signalled our skipper to the engine-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it was too late. In another second our jib-boom caught something on the other vessel  and tore it away with a crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ship  ahoy! What ship&rsquo;s that? Where the devil are you coming to?&rsquo; hailed a sharp,  stern voice, and there was a sudden rush of light from a dozen lanterns on the  rail of a big double-funnelled steamer, whose sides towered like black cliffs  over those of the <i>Tallahassee</i>&rsquo;<i>s</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without  a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, our skipper sang out, at the same time touching the bell  for full speed ahead, &lsquo;Federal warship <i>Mohican!</i>&rsquo;  &ldquo;At this there was a laugh on the other vessel, and the same voice replied, &lsquo;If  you don&rsquo;t stop, I&rsquo;ll blow you out of the water!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  by this the <i>Tallahassee</i> was a quarter of a mile away,  and there was no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Lie  down, fore and aft! flat! men, flat!&rsquo; all at once shouted our skipper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before  we had time to fully catch his meaning the darkness seemed to be rent by a  roaring, blazing volcano, and a regular squall of shot hummed and whistled  about our ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  there was a crash of falling spars, and I expected every minute to find myself  in the water, or in bits travelling skyward. But luckily we were too far ahead  to receive the full benefit of the broadside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  it was, only two or three hit us, taking our mizzen-mast clean off, going  through the bulwarks, and wounding one of the Fowey men with a splinter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  did not fire again, but as we stopped dead we heard the churning of  paddle-wheels, and saw light signals made to her consorts by the ship whose  patrolling we had disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  fellow&rsquo;s wound was only skin-deep, but it bled like one o&rsquo;clock, and we began to  wonder seriously, if this was blockade-running, what real warfare would be  like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That  was the <i>Delaware</i>,  Harvey,&rsquo; I  heard the skipper say to his brother, as they stood and watched us haul the  wreckage inboard. &lsquo;I knew old Cooper&rsquo;s voice at once. There&rsquo;ll be no getting  through to-night. They&rsquo;ll make bonfires of themselves directly. Do you think  you could take us up to the sandy cove at the back of Green Island,  where our fishing camp used to be in the old days?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ay,&rsquo;  replied his brother, &lsquo;if it was as dark again. See, there they go!&rsquo; alluding to  the blockaders, who were steaming about, burning flare-ups that illuminated the  whole entrance to the river&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harvey  Warrington now conned the <i>Tallahassee</i> so  nicely that, at daybreak, we crept gently between banks of low rocks into a  miniature harbour on one of the many islets that lay thickly thereabout. There  was just enough room to turn; and rounding a point that shut us in, we dropped  anchor off a beautiful sandy beach in ten fathoms of water. From the thick  underbrush with which the little island was covered, we watched the men-o&rsquo;-war  pottering about, sometimes well out to sea, at others so close that if we had  not cut away our foremast, they must have seen it sticking up over the scrub.  The whole day they would keep at this game. Then at nights back again to the  entrance, patrolling and burning flare-ups at intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  began to think that we were in rather a tight fix, and I fancy our officers  thought so too, for they looked glumly enough across the long four miles of sea  that lay between us and the mainland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless,  they could have got our cargo ashore at some other place. But, as I gathered,  there was, at this precise time, an army in the neighbourhood waiting  impatiently for our arrival. It was, you see, in the early portion of the great  fight, and I expect, though men were plentiful, arms and stuff were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  continued my companion as, rising, he looked at the clock, struck four bells,  and then went over to leeward and pulled the ears of a little apprentice, fast  asleep, with his head on a coil of running-gear. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, reseating  himself, and starting a fresh cigar, after the small bustle of relieving the  wheel was over, &ldquo;there we stuck, laid up snugly enough. And there, too, stuck  Uncle Sam&rsquo;s old tubs, all of whom, but for their guns and our touchy cargo, we  could have run rings around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  last, on the third morning, we saw the two Warringtons walking quickly down to  the gig, waiting for them as usual at the sandy beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  seemed very jolly and pleased as we pulled on board. Evidently they had got  hold of some scheme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently  the port-watch, with all the boats, and every axe and tomahawk in the ship, was  ordered ashore. Then the second mate got his instructions, and we rigged up the  two masts fore and aft, and level with the top of the funnel, ridge-pole  fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  this we laid all the spare spars, like rafters, letting them overlap the ship&rsquo;s  rail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  the time we had the <i>Tallahassee</i> roofed in, as it were, back came the three boats, full of green bushes, young  pines, and long reeds. What on earth the skipper was turning his ship into a  big arbour for we couldn&rsquo;t for a while understand. But in an hour or so, when  you couldn&rsquo;t tell the steamer from the shore, we began to see his dodge.  Between us and the main were plenty of hummocks not much larger than the <i>Tallahassee</i>, and scrubby  from top to bottom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Late  that night we finished our &lsquo;decorations,&rsquo; as the skipper called them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  weight was considerable, but we&rsquo;d trimmed her so well that there wasn&rsquo;t the  shadow of a list. And in five minutes, by a simple contrivance of tackles and a  few blows from a sharp axe, the whole affair could be shunted overboard,  leaving only the bare decks, smoke-stack, and bridge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re  going out for a picnic in the morning, boys,&rsquo; said the skipper, laughing. &lsquo;If  they won&rsquo;t let us in by dark, we must e&rsquo;en try them by daylight Besides,  to-morrow is the Fourth of July, and Uncle Sam will be glad of some garlands to  dress his ships with.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  morning broke wet and misty, but calm; and as soon as it was light we moved out  so slowly that we scarcely seemed to move at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly  abreast of us, looking like thicker blobs of haze through the drizzle, were the  war-ships. Three were well out. But one kept sentry-go right in our course. To  avoid running ashore we should have to pass within a quarter of a mile of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can tell you that, once in the open, it was pretty ticklish work, and enough to  make a man bite his fingers from the slow waiting of it, as we stood peering  through the leaves, with the steamer lying quite still for minutes together in  her character of island. It was miserable, bleak, cheerless weather, and  presumably a holiday on board the blockaders. Perhaps this was the reason that  none of their look-outs spotted the freak of nature dawdling insensibly along  towards the mouth of the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  anyrate, none did; and, at length, we left the three outsiders fairly astern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  there were no more islands to keep us in countenance; they, too, were behind  us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  couple of miles of clear water and that one battle-ship, growing every minute  more distinct, between us and safety!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  still we continued to drift imperceptibly down upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  was nearly motionless, and I remember thinking she was like a great cat, half  asleep, and blinking lazily, whilst a mouse watches for a chance to get past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently  we were close enough to make out the figures in their long oilskin coats on her  bridge. It seemed almost impossible for us&mdash;island or no island&mdash;to go much  farther without being noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  actually passed her, drawing our breaths shortly; every ounce of steam on,  engineers expecting the word to go; men at the lifts and guy-ropes ready to  throw off our green disguise, and thirty pairs of eyes glaring at her without  daring to wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  when at the end of a week (as it almost seemed) we left her away on the port  quarter, the long sigh of relief the men gave made the leaves rustle again. She  was a big, brig-rigged, clumsy-looking lump, and wouldn&rsquo;t have bothered us a  bit but for the long tier of guns whose black muzzles we had seen poking grimly  through their ports.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  as I said, we left her dozing in the slopping drizzle, and drifted along until  we opened the harbour and made cocksure of getting in, altogether unperceived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I had just made a remark to this effect, and the men were beginning to take  their eyes off her and yarn, when up from her stack puffed a thick black cloud  as she moved swiftly towards us, suspicious at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Over  with it!&rdquo; roared the skipper, waving his hands to the chaps at the guys. Then,  into the engine-room, &lsquo;Throw her wide open, lads, and let her rip!&rsquo; In less  time than it takes to tell you about it, bushes, spars, and reeds were in the  water, and the <i>Tallahassee</i> racing&mdash;bounding, by jingo!&mdash;over it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe the other fellows were at first too much astonished at such a  transformation to do anything but stare,</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  they soon recovered, and sent their whole broadside after us. And they hit us,  too&mdash;peppered us all over this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And,  presently, as if this wasn&rsquo;t enough, up waddled the rest of &nbsp;&rsquo;em, and started to throw shells, which burst  ahead and all around us, filling every corner with chips and splinters and  whizzing iron. In a minute men were lying about all over the deck, doubled up  and groaning, whilst right in the middle of the infernal hurly-burly stood the  skipper and his brother, smoking, and watching from the bridge, and sending  orders to the engineers, who, to judge by the way the boat shook and jumped,  were already doing their best to blow us all up. We knew that there was a fort  somewhere up the harbour. But it was a mile yet to the entrance, and nothing  seemed more certain than that the fire from the four ships would do for us  before we could get in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although  the water all around was white with the rain of shot and bursting shell, as yet  the <i>Tallahassee</i> had been hit in no vital part.  Low, and grey, and flat, and scooting like a dolphin, she wasn&rsquo;t an easy  target.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;We&rsquo;ll  surely go in a minute or two, either up or down,&rsquo; I said to myself, as I crept  for&rsquo;ard on hands and knees, over dead and wounded, and through pools of still  warm blood. &lsquo;But I must have that new ticket of mine out of my chest. It gave  me trouble enough to get, and I&rsquo;ll carry it with me. There may be just a chance  yet.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  what I said, or thought, anyhow, as I made for the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle hatchway. You see,  I was as proud of that second mate&rsquo;s certificate as a dog with a tin tail, or a  man with a pretty wife at a public table whilst the honeymoon&rsquo;s on, and it went  to my heart to think of its being spoiled with salt water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crawling  slowly along, I suddenly heard the skipper and the others on the bridge  cheering as loud as they could shout. Then came a tremendous explosion on our  port bow, that seemed to deaden and belittle all the rest of the row. Lifting  my head, and peeping over the rail, I saw a curious craft coming full split  from the nor&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  for her smoke-stack and a low fortlike construction right along her deck, she  was nearly level with the water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was the first iron-clad of the Confederacy, the historical <i>Merrimac</i>; and her great guns roared again and again like peals of  the loudest thunder as she hurried up to take a hand in the game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the wooden ships didn&rsquo;t wait. They took to their heels like mad when they saw  what it was; and that funny floating fortress mauled them nicely before they  got out of range.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  told us afterwards that three days ago they had attacked and sunk the <i>Mohican</i>&mdash;the ship we tried to pass  ourselves off as.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  wonder the <i>Delaware</i> didn&rsquo;t stand on ceremony with us  when we fouled her in the dark!</p>
<p>&ldquo;However,  thanks to the <i>Merrimac</i>, with her  thick hide and 8-inch guns, we got our boat into port in one piece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  besides a dozen or so of us badly wounded, there were five who had run the last  Great Blockade of all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I never tackled any more of it. Too close an imitation of the real thing for  me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi,  there, you little scamp to lee&rsquo;ard! Asleep again? Rouse up, and see if it isn&rsquo;t  eight bells yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MyMadMessmate"></a>My Mad  Messmate</b></h2>
<p>It  was late in the summer of &rsquo;8&mdash; that, tired of the Micawber-like game of waiting  for something to turn up, I signed articles as A.B. in Green&rsquo;s Sailors&rsquo; Home,  London, for the barque <i>Princess</i> of  that port, 600 tons register, A1 at Lloyd&rsquo;s, carrying fourteen A.B.&rsquo;s, and  chartered for Singapore, the voyage, altogether signed for, not to exceed three  years. By the way, all vessels we read or hear of seem to be classed A1; or, if  there is any departure from that magical number into a lower class, mention of  the fact seems carefully avoided. However, when I boarded the <i>Princess</i>, lying in the stream off Gravesend, she seemed to fulfil the conditions exacted by  &ldquo;A1.&rdquo; She was evidently built for speed more than capacity of stowage, shaped  very much like a wedge, narrow in the beam, and very square aloft. My chest,  or, in sea slang, &ldquo;donkey,&rdquo; was soon into the &ldquo;fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle&rdquo; and firmly secured  with lashings to the cleats on deck; and all hands turned to, busily getting  ready for sea, and for the head wind which we knew was blowing up Channel&mdash;  securing water-casks, lashing spars, etc. Whilst so employed I had time for a  look round at the strange faces I had to pass at least the next three months  with. Most of them, as I expected, had hardly got over their spree ashore yet,  and sore heads and short answers seemed to be the order of the day, so far; but  I was glad to see that all, or nearly all, were English. The one exception that  I could perceive was a tall, very strongly-built, fair-haired man, as to whose  nationality I was puzzled to decide, except that he belonged to some one of the  Northern European nations. His vocabulary of English was apparently limited to  &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;No,&rdquo; but the most remarkable feature of the man was his eyes, one  moment black as jet, then changing suddenly to blue with a greenish tint, then  back to their normal colour, apparently a dark brown. The two of us were sent  out for&rsquo;ard to bend some of the head sails, and I could see by the way he went  about his work that, whatever else he might be, he was a thorough seaman.</p>
<p>The  rest of our &ldquo;crowd&rdquo; were the usual run of merchant seamen, good-natured,  careless chaps enough, without a thought for the future or a regret for the  past, well expressed in their own pithy saying, &ldquo;Come day, go day, God send  Sunday.&rdquo; Our skipper was a little red-whiskered Aberdeen man, with a very keen eye to the  main chance. The mate was a Jersey man, a  smart seaman, but very fond of long words when shorter and simpler ones would  have done better, and the men used to say he was nothing but a &ldquo;blessed walking  &lsquo;Dic.&rsquo;&rdquo; Our second mate was an &ldquo;owner&rsquo;s apprentice,&rdquo; just out of his time, and,  being a sort of twenty-fifth cousin of one of the clerks in the office, had had  greatness thrust upon him before he was ready for it, so they put the bo&rsquo;sun in  his watch to nurse him, and take care that he didn&rsquo;t put us ashore before <i>our</i> time. A jolly, thorough-going old  salt was our bo&rsquo;sun, or &ldquo;Old Daddy,&rdquo; as he was generally called by all hands.  He was one of a race of seamen&mdash;more&rsquo;s the pity!&mdash;nearly extinct, at least in the  merchant service &mdash; with a face bronzed by many years&rsquo; exposure to all weathers;  eyes of darkest blue which flashed yet, in spite of his threescore or so of  years, with nearly all their pristine vigour; compactly built, and still active  and lively in his movements, allowing no man on board to take the lead of him,  and with a voice that could make itself heard in any gale that ever blew.</p>
<p>Amongst  my watch-mates was the foreigner of whom I had taken such particular notice as  we lay at the buoys off Gravesend. The more I  saw of him, now we were at sea, the less I liked him; apparently the feeling  extended to all hands, fore and aft. There was a nameless something in the man&rsquo;s  manner, and especially in those savage, luminous eyes of his, which impressed  one with a sense of danger and repulsion, hard to explain on any reasonable  grounds, for he seemed quiet enough, and did his duty as well as any of us.</p>
<p>Even  our old bo&rsquo;sun, kind-hearted though he was, was heard muttering one day  something about &ldquo;That Rooshian Finn.&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Dad, that&rsquo;s what he is, is  it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the old fellow, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve logged him down as, an&rsquo; I  never knew luck to the ship as one on &rsquo;em sailed in yet; besides, look at his &lsquo;lamps&rsquo;  bless me if I ever seed the likes on &rsquo;em.&rdquo; This last argument was unanswerable,  for there certainly was something &ldquo;uncanny&rdquo; about the fellow. I don&rsquo;t think any  one of us knew his right name, but he answered after a fashion to that of &ldquo;Hans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  ran through the famous Bay of Biscay,  encountered a heavy gale, and then passed into the Trades, which blew with such  delightful steadiness that at nights a good deal of &ldquo;caulking,&rdquo; that is,  sleeping, could be done by every soul on board except the officers of the  watch, and the men at the look-out and wheel.</p>
<p>But  our snoozing was to be interrupted in a way which I think very few of us  expected, with perhaps the exception of our old bo&rsquo;sun.</p>
<p>Hans  for the last week had shown strong symptoms of being very much excited about  something or other, and talked to himself incessantly in a strange-sounding and  uncouth tongue, so much so, indeed, that he became a perfect nuisance,  especially in our watches below. He was remonstrated with by signs and  gestures, but without avail, till at length he started singing, the Lord only  knows what about; he might have been chanting the sea battles of old Vikings  for anything we knew to the contrary, so wild and weird in sound was his  singing. As I think I have before mentioned, Hans was a man of great strength  and stature, so that although our chief officer said &ldquo;the man was fast  approaching a condition of imbecility,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Daddy&rdquo; swore that he was  &ldquo;cranky,&rdquo; and there was a talk of putting him in irons, unfortunately it was  not done. But the crisis was close at hand.</p>
<p>We  were getting pretty well into the tail of the S.E. Trades, when one night,  about the middle of the first watch, as it looked rather squally to windward,  the order was given to clew up and stow the royals, and haul down the gaff  topsail and flying jib. Two of our lads sprang aloft&mdash;one to each royal. The one  at the fore soon had his sail in and stowed, but the main royal was still  bellying and flapping aloft; the night was dark and drizzly, with light squalls  of wind and rain, so we couldn&rsquo;t see what was the matter, but after a short  time down came the boy, and told us that Hans was in the maintop and wouldn&rsquo;t  let him up, also that he had an axe with which he was doing something to the  topgallant-stunsails, which with their gear are generally stowed in the tops.</p>
<p>The  poor little fellow was evidently terribly frightened, and said &ldquo;that Hans had  tried to knock him off the futtock shrouds with his axe, but being light and  nimble he had sprung off on to the topmast backstay, and so on deck.&rdquo; This was  truly a nice state of affairs, an armed madman in possession of the mainmast!</p>
<p>Mr.  Semple, the second mate, was for calling the skipper and first mate at once,  but the bo&rsquo;sun said that as the watch was nearly out, and the squall over, we  had better sheet home the royal and try and coax Hans down. We soon had hold of  the sheets on each side. &ldquo;Comes precious easy,&rdquo; said one, and easy it did come,  for in a minute or so the whole hundred feet of rope lay in a confused heap on  either side the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  out, lads!&rdquo; said the bo&rsquo;sun; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s cut &rsquo;em, and if he comes down now he&rsquo;s duty  bound to run a-muck.&rdquo; At that moment the moon, hitherto veiled behind the  squall clouds, shone brightly out, shone on the knot of upturned, wondering  faces, and on the tall dark figure in the top, as the belly of the topsail  threw back to us the hoarse notes of his mad song. &ldquo;Maintop there! what are you  up to? Come down out o&rsquo; that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  reply to this hail was a marlin spike which laid one of our watch flat on deck,  with his arm broken just above the elbow. Then eight bells struck, and the  watch below was called.</p>
<p>Captain  and mate were soon on deck, the wounded man carried below, where his arm was  quickly set by &ldquo;Old Daddy,&rdquo; and all hands bundled aft; as for the skipper, when  he saw the state of things, he just stood on the deck and &ldquo;swoor at lairge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our  Scotch carpenter now appeared on the scene, having been overhauling his tools,  and said he missed &ldquo;twa o&rsquo; his best axes, his adze, and nearly all his  chisels,&rdquo; one of which last, however, was soon returned to him in a most  unpleasant manner from aloft, just taking the skin off his nose. In fact, we  all had to keep well under cover, or some more of us would soon have been hit.  The madman&rsquo;s aim was something wonderful even by the uncertain moonlight, and,  as someone suggested, what was it likely to be when day broke!</p>
<p>Our  royal, meanwhile, was blowing straight out from the yard like a great white  banner, sheets and clewlines cut, against the morning sky, which already the  sun-gold was dotting with island cloudlets of rose and amethyst, heralding the  Day King, whose burning rim soon appeared far away above the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>Every  soul in the ship was now aft, and advice was freely given as to the best way of  getting Hans out of his citadel&mdash;for such it might now fairly be called. With  true mad cunning he had cut the stunsail gear up and wound it round the topmast  rigging knee high, rendering it almost impossible for any climber to get a  footing without being cut down, and nobody seemed to care about facing the  broad bright axe and the muscular arms which whirled it savagely round now and  again, as if to emphasise some events celebrated in his wild song, which was  nearly incessant.</p>
<p>However,  it was very evident that by some means he must be brought down; so away aloft  went the mate and myself into the mizzen crosstrees, with a long line and  running bowline, to try our hands at &ldquo;lassoing.&rdquo; Many heaves were made in vain,  as, spite of our long lower masts, we were barely on a level with the maintop.  Hans stood erect, and never even tried to avoid the flying noose; till at last  the mate, with a lucky cast, pitched the bowline fairly over his head and  shoulders; but so excited were we that we had neglected to take a round turn  with the end of our line, and Hans very nearly pulled us both off our perch.  Then with one slash of his keen sheath-knife he severed the rope, and to our  horror seized his axe and cut clean through the lanyards of the topmast rigging  on each side. He next fell to work cutting and hacking at the wire stays and  backstays which supported our masts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  heavens,&rdquo; said the first mate, &ldquo;if it comes on to blow we&rsquo;ll lose our sticks,&rdquo;  then returning to his old style, which, however, he seldom used in cases of  emergency, &ldquo;and intrinsically imperil the existence of ourselves and our  vessel.&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at the comical way he bundled the last  sentence out; for at the time we were coming down the mizzen rigging, in full  view of the maintop, from which three or four keen-edged chisels whizzing past  our ears helped us down pretty fast.</p>
<p>It  may appear almost incredible to a landsman that one man, however powerful,  should keep a ship&rsquo;s company of twenty or thirty men at bay in this way. But  let the said landsman imagine this same powerful madman, armed with a sharp  axe, and stationed on a small platform, forty feet from the ground, say, in the  fork of a tree, with a ladder leading up to it on each side, but so constructed  that only a single person could obtain access to the platform on each ladder,  and that the madman standing about the centre thereof could comfortably knock  each one on the head as he appeared. Well, the cases are nearly identical, save  that &ldquo;our madman&rdquo; had done us more damage in a few hours than the man in the  tree could ever do, for by this time he had so chopped and hacked our rigging  about that, if the wind freshened, we should have been in a most woeful plight</p>
<p>Thank  Heaven! the breeze kept light and steady all that day, in the course of which  all kinds of attempts had been made to get the man down, but without avail, the  only result being that two of the port-watch, having rashly exposed themselves  in their endeavours, got badly cut about the head; and it was almost laughable  to see &ldquo;Chips&rdquo; creeping from shelter to shelter, with his eyes fixed aloft, and  a great patch of black plaster on his nose, to pick up his beloved tools, using  at the same time much vigorous language in very broad Scotch.</p>
<p>In  spite of his fondness for long and often misapplied words, the first mate was  full of pluck, He wished to take Hans by storm on each side, but for a long  time the captain forbade it, saying it would cost at least two lives, and  perhaps many more; but I could see that the mate was very unwilling to give up  his plan, so I was not surprised when, at two bells&mdash;five o&rsquo;clock&mdash;in the first  dog-watch, he had obtained a reluctant permission to ask for volunteers. All  hands were with him at once, for we were getting heartily sick of this state of  things, besides being in constant fear of our lives; for we didn&rsquo;t know the  minute he might come down and &ldquo;run a-muck&rdquo; amongst us. I had once seen a coolie  do this in Madras,  cutting and stabbing everyone in his way, till at last a pistol bullet cut  short his career; but he made things lively whilst it lasted.</p>
<p>It  was now nearly a calm, and of course darkness was coming on. Nearly all the  canvas had been taken off the ship, except as much as would give her steerage  way, to ease the strain on our masts, which now, some of their main supports  being gone, creaked and swayed and complained very ominously indeed at every  roll she gave.</p>
<p>Well,  away we went, each watch to its own side of the deck, to storm the maintop. We  had already got as far as the main rigging&mdash; the mate leading&mdash;when our  vacillating &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; left the wheel, which was now almost useless, and came to  the break of the poop, singing out &ldquo;to hold on,&rdquo; and &ldquo;take daylight for it in  the morning.&rdquo; It was in vain the mate represented the crippled state of the  ship to him, and what a fix we should be in if it came on to blow. &ldquo;Na, na. If  ye do&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll joost ca&rsquo; it mutiny, an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; aboot it,&rdquo; was the only answer  he could get, so for the time the attempt was abandoned.</p>
<p>We  were all standing in a group at the main-bitts talking it over, and one of the  watch was remarking, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s knocked off his cursed squalling this half-hour!  Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he was asl&mdash;&rdquo; when with a rush and a yell he was in our  midst dealing blows in all directions. You should have seen the scatter. Most  of us took to the rigging, but it was too dark to make anything out with  certainty. Suddenly I saw a flash from aft, then three or four more in quick  succession. I happened to be in the lee main rigging, and one of the humming  little revolver bullets passed close to my head. Naturally enough, I was making  tracks for cover, when I felt myself crushed close into the ratlines, with a  weight like a ton on my head and shoulders, but it eased off at once, and looking  up I could just make out a figure vanishing aloft in the gloom.</p>
<p>It  was Hans, who had most unceremoniously made use of me in his ascent, although I  question whether he knew what he was treading on, and, as he was barefooted, I  didn&rsquo;t suffer much. I sang out at once &ldquo;to stop their confounded firing, as  Hans was aloft again,&rdquo; and, jumping on deck, nearly knocked our skipper down.  Hearing my hail, he had taken heart of grace, and descended from the lifeboat,  where we found out afterwards he had taken refuge. &ldquo;Did I hit him, think ye?&rdquo;  was his first question. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;but I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you&rsquo;ve hit  half the ship&rsquo;s company.&rdquo; &ldquo;Hoots, mon! Dinna say that!&rdquo; exclaimed he, and  trotted off, singing out like mad for lights.</p>
<p>I  had heard or seen nothing of the first mate in the <i>mel&eacute;e</i>, and with good reason, for when the binnacle and masthead  lamps were brought, we found him jammed between the pumps, and blood flowing  from a very nasty gash in his forehead. He remained insensible for nearly half  an hour, but after that we soon got him round, and put him in his berth. Three  or four more had received knocks and cuts with the pole or edge of the axe; and  all round there seemed a general sore feeling with respect to the occupant of  the maintop, who was now apparently congratulating himself in blank verse on  his last escapade.</p>
<p>Presently  a meeting was called in the mate&rsquo;s berth, attended by all hands, a good few of  whom looked as if they had just fought the ship through a pretty hot action.  Our wounded chief officer was sitting up on his bunk, declaring himself nearly  well again, although his white face and bloody bandages did not add to his  beauty. After a lot of talk, it seemed to be universally decided that the way  was to cripple Hans by shooting him with the skipper&rsquo;s revolver. Then, it was  argued, it would be easy to get him down without risking life, as we were  already short-handed, for the seaman whose arm had been broken was in a bad  way. He was now pacing the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle in great pain, and he it was whose voice we  heard singing out, &ldquo;Light on the port bow.&rdquo; We were on deck in a minute, and  sure enough we could all make out a ship&rsquo;s light about four miles away, and evidently  fast approaching us. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bringing the breeze with her,&rdquo; said one. &ldquo;Not much  sign of it yet, then,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;Breeze be blowed!&rdquo; was &ldquo;Old Dad&rsquo;s&rdquo;  comment. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we in the Doldrums, where no breeze like she&rsquo;s got ever blew  since Adam was an oakum boy in Plymouth Dockyard? The whole lot o&rsquo; yer&rsquo;s got  eyes like burnt holes in a blanket. It&rsquo;s a&rsquo; smokejack&rsquo;s white masthead light.  That&rsquo;s what yon is, or call me a Dutchman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>True  enough, as the grey dawn began to break we saw the long stream of smoke still  lingering in the air astern of her, apparently for miles, testifying eloquently  to the stillness of the atmosphere. A little later she evidently sighted us,  and, altering her course a little, bore right down for the <i>Princess</i>, and no wonder! for we must have looked a strange sight  through her glasses. All our sails were furled, with the exception of the  main-royal and topgallantsail and a solitary staysail; some of the braces were  cut, our yards cockbilled to port or starboard at their own sweet will, ends of  rope and rigging hung in all directions about the main, and everything looked  confused and forlorn, as she rolled heavily now and again in the long Atlantic  swell. As the steamer neared us we made her out to be a very large vessel,  brig-rigged and paddle-wheeled, and that her bows and rigging were full of  people all looking eagerly towards us. She steamed up very close, and &ldquo;Ship,  ahoy! What ship&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; came across the still water as the paddles stopped  their churning and frothing, and the big ship came closer still. &ldquo;<i>Princess</i>, of London,&rdquo; was immediately  followed by &ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? do you want any help?&rdquo; from a stout man in a blue  uniform, who stood on her poop netting, holding on by one hand to the main  rigging, whilst around him and all along her decks a crowd of eager faces  appeared. Not waiting for an answer to his last hail, he jumped down, gave some  sharp, quick orders, and in a few minutes the port-quarter boat was lowered and  was pulling for us full of men, whilst the steamer &ldquo;blew off&rdquo; with the usual  horrid roar and shriek.</p>
<p>In  the excitement Hans had apparently been forgotten; but the noise of the  escaping steam having made me look up, I saw him, stripped to the belt, gazing  intently on the boat&rsquo;s crew, who were already coming up the gangway ladder,  which had been hastily thrown over amidships, the &ldquo;Man in Blue&rdquo; leading,  another and slighter gentleman behind, and about a dozen sailors, all dressed  much alike, following.</p>
<p>Hans,  on whom I still kept an eye, had stooped down for a second, and when he stood  upright again, I saw he had one of Chips&rsquo; &ldquo;twa axes&rdquo; in his hands, preparing to  swing it with all his might into the party on the poop. I had hardly time to  shout, &ldquo;Look out &mdash;look out, there!&rdquo; when down it came, but luckily it hit one  of the wire backstays, which was swinging about amidships, cut it in two, and  then went overboard. Our own men, who by this time well knew the meaning of the  cry, had dodged for cover in a moment; and it would have gone hard with some of  the strangers but for the cut backstay.</p>
<p>I  just heard the &ldquo;Man in Blue&rdquo; exclaim, &ldquo;Eh, eh! what the deuce is all this about?&rdquo;  when our skipper took him and the other visitor, who looked something like a parson,  down into the cabin.</p>
<p>We  learned from the steamer&rsquo;s men&mdash;who could hardly get over their surprise at the  state of affairs&mdash;and who broadly hinted that their &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; would have shot  the madman long ago&mdash;that the steamer was the <i>Orion</i> Cape mail boat&mdash;that the man in blue was the captain, and the  parson-looking chap a French doctor, a passenger. They also said that when they  first sighted us, the general opinion was that the ship was in a state of  mutiny; and the speaker, pulling up the bottom of his blue guernsey, showed us  a pair of revolvers stuck in his belt, informing us at the same time that the  steamer&rsquo;s signal guns were, as he phrased it, &ldquo;bang up to the muzzle with  grape, ready, if needed, to sweep our decks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  a few minutes the cabin party, including our mate, appeared on deck, smelling  suggestively, and looking suspiciously aloft. But there was Hans&mdash;his white skin  showing out in bold relief against the dark masthead&mdash;in the same attitude he  had assumed after his last futile attempt, upright and facing us, each hand  grasping a rope, his eyes looking black and sunken, bareheaded, with fair hair  hanging matted and thick on his shoulders, and, as I fancied I could make out,  a savage scowl on his face, which was pale as death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; the captain of the steamer was saying; &ldquo;that sort of popgun won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo;  pointing to our &ldquo;Old Man&rsquo;s&rdquo; revolver, which was lying on the skylight; &ldquo;just as  likely to kill the man as not, even if we hit him at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weel,  weel,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the only thing o&rsquo; the kind I hae aboord. I&rsquo;m na  caring muckle to be fashed wi&rsquo; sic-like weepons,&rdquo; and the old fellow puckered  up his thick red eyebrows, while a kind of grin overspread his saturnine old  phiz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the other, &ldquo;did ever anyone hear the like,&mdash;a ship going to  sail in Chinese waters, with nothing but an old pistol aboard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  maybe happen to get some mair in Singapoor,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;Ay, ay; and you&rsquo;ll  maybe happen to get your throats cut before you get there, even in these  times.&rdquo; And with this bit of cold comfort, the &ldquo;Man in Blue,&rdquo; as I shall  continue to call him&mdash;for I have forgotten his proper name &mdash;gave an order to his  coxswain. The boat&rsquo;s crew jumped in at once and pulled for the steamer, which  had slightly increased her distance from the <i>Princess</i>, for a nasty swell was coming up, giving us a roll now and  again, that made me think everything was coming down by the run. However, the  boat was soon alongside again with, in addition to her crew, three or four  passengers, one amongst whom the &ldquo;Man in Blue&rdquo; no sooner caught sight of than,  with the exclamation, &ldquo;Ha! Major, the very man; you&rsquo;re more used to these tools  than I am,&rdquo; he at the same time presented him with the rifle his coxswain had  brought from the steamer.</p>
<p>All  on board the other vessel had by this some idea how affairs stood with us, so,  after very few words, the Major agreed to do his best, and glancing up at the  maintop, asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the best place to hit him?&rdquo; &ldquo;In the head, if I had my  way,&rdquo; growled the old bo&rsquo;sun in what was meant for an aside; but the Major  heard him, and faced round with a sharp &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; The old chap was a bit taken  aback at first, but soon replied, &ldquo;Well, because, ye see, sir, he&rsquo;s a Rooshian  Finn, which is only a name for varmin as always comes aboard ships to make a  shine; leastways this is the third I&rsquo;ve seen do it; though they&rsquo;re ondeniable  good sailor men, which to my mind makes the matter wuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  well,&rdquo; said the Major, a fine soldierly-looking man, in the prime of life, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  try and cripple him somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  excitement was now great. Officers, sailors, and passengers all seemed to hold  their breaths as the rifle was levelled at the fierce-looking, seemingly  unconscious figure, whose eyes were staring fixedly at the steamer, which had  now edged in almost too close for safety, and whose rigging and yards were  crowded with anxious spectators.</p>
<p>I  was standing close behind the Major, and it seemed to me that he aimed straight  at Hans&rsquo; right leg, which was in full view, a little extended.</p>
<p>A  good time apparently had been chosen, for the vessel was steady as a rock, but  almost simultaneously with the report she gave one of those quick treacherous  lurches, and I saw the muzzle of the rifle fly upwards, as, in common with the  rest of us, the Major lost his footing, and slid leeward.</p>
<p>Before  the <i>Princess</i> rolled back again, the  smoke cleared away, and we saw our unfortunate shipmate lying across the mizzen  stay, bent nearly double, and his blood dropping and plashing down on the white  lifeboat immediately beneath him, and running down her sides in ghastly crimson  streaks on deck.</p>
<p>There  he hung whilst you might count five, and then dropped with an awful thud  between boat and spars on to the quarter-deck. The noise of his fall seemed to  break the spell of dismay which had come over us, and all hands rushed down the  poop ladders on to the deck, where lay poor Hans on his face, quite dead, the  bullet having entered just over the right hip. The little doctor lifted the  dead man&rsquo;s arm up, held it for a moment, then letting it fall on deck again,  walked away. When hit, Hans had evidently sprung clear out of the top and  fallen across the stay. If he had not cut the topmast rigging, his barricade of  rope might have prevented his fall, but it was that unlucky lurch that did the  mischief!</p>
<p>The  Major stood leaning against the capstan, looking steadily at the corpse, till  the &ldquo;Man in Blue&rdquo; clapped him on the shoulder, with &ldquo;Now, Major, the boat!&rdquo;  Then said he suddenly, &ldquo;I feel almost like a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh,  pooh, nonsense,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;couldn&rsquo;t possibly have been helped. It was to  be, you know.&rdquo; However, the Major didn&rsquo;t quite seem to see it in that light,  but all that he said was, &ldquo;I knew that he was a dead man, as I felt her lift my  feet up when I pulled the trigger,&rdquo; and he went down the gangway ladder looking  very uncomfortable indeed.</p>
<p>The  &ldquo;Man in Blue&rdquo; followed with the rest, after a hasty leave-taking and a short  private talk between the two skippers. As we raised the body up to carry it  forward that the sail-maker might do his work, we saw a rush of smoke from the  big ship&rsquo;s funnel, and heard the grinding of her paddles, as she moved slowly off  on her course, dipping her ensign three times, and then letting it remain  half-mast high as long as she was in sight. In less than an hour she was  hull-down, leaving with us tars only her name in remembrance of the part she  had played in our little tragedy.</p>
<p>In  a few hours everything aloft was again shipshape, running-gear all rove,  preventer backstays set up, etc., or, as our first mate expressed it, &ldquo;The  chaotic confusion of the preceding forty-eight hours was ultimately reduced to  a minimum.&rdquo; This remark addressed to the skipper was answered only by a blank  stare and a low growl, amidst which &ldquo;Near as daft as th&rsquo; ither ane,&rdquo; was all I could  catch.</p>
<p>A  light breeze now springing up, the <i>Princess</i> again began to slip through the water, although very slowly, almost as if  lingering to get rid of the motionless object lying on the forehatch, sewn up  in canvas, weighted with old iron bolts, and covered with the Union Jack and  ensign.</p>
<p>A  burial is always an impressive spectacle, but it is especially so at sea; and  when all hands mustered in their best rig that evening at the gangway, the ship&rsquo;s  bell tolling, and the main-topsail backed, everyone seemed fully to feel the  solemn influence of the occasion, although many there bore marks of the dead  man&rsquo;s handiwork. It was a lovely evening, the sun fast setting, and tingeing  with a subdued rosy light the immense ocean in which we were to hide our dead, only  broken now and again by tiny wavelets, which came with a gentle &ldquo;swish&rdquo; against  the ship&rsquo;s side, pouring its softened rays right on the silent and attentive  group of men, on the flag-covered grating with a man at each side, which  overhung the water, and on the pale face and white bandaged head of our chief  mate, standing alone with open book on the after side.</p>
<p>All  uncovered, and not a sound broke the evening stillness but the solemn tones of  the reader&rsquo;s voice, till at length &ldquo;We commit his body to the deep, to be  turned into corruption, looking for the resurrection of the body, when the sea  shall give up her dead, and the life of the world to come.&rdquo; Then&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;A  plash and a plunge, and all was o&rsquo;er,<br>
And the billows rolled on as they rolled before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  yards were braced up, the sails filled out steadily with the breeze, and the <i>Princess</i> moved swiftly through the  water, soon leaving far astern the last solitary resting-place of our &ldquo;Mad  Messmate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="WithTheFirstTeaOfTheSeason"></a>With The  First Tea Of The Season</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>The Start</b></h3>
<p>A river,  broad, sparkling, and deep, covered with boats of outlandish build and rig,  flows swiftly between low hills, whose steep sides are clothed with dark green  foliage, out of which peep, here and there, houses of strange and fantastic  shape.</p>
<p>In  front of some half a dozen tall ships, all dressed in their gayest bunting, and  whose crews are all, with cheers and songs, and clatter and rattle of windlass  pawls, so busily engaged in heaving up their anchors, one catches a glimpse of  a town and wharves crowded with quaint-looking craft, a farther view of which  is cut off by a sudden turn of the river. Nearer, however, is a small island,  on which stands a structure that somehow brings to our recollection, with curious  distinctness, childhood&rsquo;s long-gone days &mdash; days in which such scenes were still  undreamt and unthought of&mdash;and yet, between which and now, that grotesque  affair, with its long, sharp spike and thousands of overhanging little eaves,  feels like a sort of connecting link. But at length memory, with an effort,  reads the puzzle and recalls to mind the blue-patterned plate of our youth,  with its funny bridge, its fruit trees, its Chinamen, and its Pagoda.</p>
<p>It  is a far cry from this Pagoda anchorage in the river Min at Foo-Chow, China, to  the buoys at Gravesend, river Thames, London, England; but, in the great ocean  race for which we on board the good ship <i>Yang-tze</i> are so busily preparing, distance does in truth &ldquo;lend enchantment to the view,&rdquo;  and not one there would willingly abridge it by a single mile of sea-surface;  for are not the eyes of the world &mdash;the commercial portion of it at least, to  which we have the honour to belong&mdash;upon us, and upon those other noble ocean  racers yonder, our friendly rivals, whose names, along with our own, familiar  are as household words in the mouths of the merchant seamen of the day?</p>
<p>Hark!  a gun! And, majestically swinging round with the tide, our ship lets fall and  sheets home her topsails and hoists her jib; cheer after cheer rings out from  her crew; and, accompanied by a hundred boats, she slowly glides towards the  sea.</p>
<p>The  echoes of the first cannon have scarcely died away when the report of another  peals on the Chinese hillsides, as our most formidable rival, the <i>Titania</i>, amidst a fresh burst of  cheering, leaves her anchorage; and long before nightfall the river is deserted  by all but junks and sampans.</p>
<p>It  has been a fair start and a good one, for next morning, outside the entrance to  the Min, six great pyramids of canvas salute each other by dipping their  ensigns and firing a gun as they sail away nearly on the same courses, before a  light easterly wind.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Off The Cape</b></h3>
<p>A  month at sea, and we are off the Cape of Storms, the only one of all, I  believe, who chose that route in preference to rounding the Horn, for our  captain had heard that the ice thereabouts was both unusually thick and much  farther to the northward than usual.</p>
<p>Not  forty-eight hours had the tea fleet kept in sight of each other. When once  fairly at sea, they seemed to suddenly disperse and disappear &mdash; some one way,  some another, according to the hobbies or theories of their respective  commanders.</p>
<p>And  now, dear reader, if you will step again on board the <i>Yang-tze</i> with me, I will endeavour to show you how we brought your  tea home from China, through at least one, and perhaps the most exciting of  those great ocean trials of speed which were wont, in the days before universal  steam so thoroughly took the wind out of our sails, to be annually associated  with the arrival of each fresh season&rsquo;s tea in the English market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,  if you please! Mind your footing on the deck, for it is wet and slippery.  There, now! catch hold of these topsail halyards&mdash; tight as fiddlestrings they  are&mdash;and look about you a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  windward a limitless expanse of greenish grey, mingled here and there with  tufts and curls of white, seethes, rolls, and dashes itself in thunderous  billows against the good ship &mdash; then in foiled fury crawls snarling away to  leeward in broken masses of white foam.</p>
<p>Aloft  three swelling patches of dirty white appear to hang against the lowering sky  in the dim light of that Southern evening; these are the three reefed topsails  of the <i>Yang-tze</i>; listen to the shrill  voice of the blast as it howls in and around their bosoms, stretched like iron  from the sharply braced-up yards, or whistles and hums through the  running-gear, as if it were playing on some immense &AElig;olian harp.</p>
<p>Swish-swash,  with a loud roar at intervals, comes a green sea over the bows, falling in a  glittering cascade across the break of the forecastle, then rushing  irresistibly away aft. The tall masts creak and groan and sway and bend, as the  vessel now throws her bows high in the air, now brings them down with a  sounding thump; one moment riding on the summit of an abyss, deep and narrow;  in another, with a long, swift, sickening slide, plunged to its very bottom,  enclosed by the threatening and lofty walls of foam-flecked water.</p>
<p>Run  your eye now along the weather bulwarks, and you will see, through the gloom,  two or three black knots, looking for all the world like some ocean fungi that  have attached themselves to the ship&rsquo;s rail, so motionless and without sign of  life are they, except that every now and again from the midst of one of the  black knots flies a red spark away down to foaming, hissing leeward. These are  groups of the watch on deck; the largest one seems to be opposite to where a  bright gleam from a crack in the closed door of the galley throws a flickering  pencil of light athwart the wet deck, and is feebly reflected from shining  oilskins and dripping sou&rsquo;-westers. Let us join it for a minute. Four men are  holding on by some of the running-gear. Two of them are smoking, and now and  again their weatherbeaten, salt-encrusted faces are lit up under their sou&rsquo;-westers  by the red dab of light from the mouths of their short pipes. They seem  absorbed in silent contemplation, their gaze only turning from the sea out to  leeward to the topsails overhead.</p>
<p>Presently,  one hoarsely mutters, &ldquo;Blessed if I knows how them sticks stands it the way  they does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  best o&rsquo; Kauri pine, them topmasts,&rdquo; replies the one next to him, who has  happened to catch the remark; &ldquo;sound&rsquo;s a bell; I oughter to know. I&rsquo;ve scraped &rsquo;em  often enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon  the old man&rsquo;ll shove another reef in at eight bells, Bill,&rdquo; says a third.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I had my way with her,&rdquo; replies the first speaker, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d soon have that there  mizzen tawps&rsquo;l, and the fore one too, off her. That &rsquo;ud steady her a bit. She&rsquo;s  no better now nor a half-tide rock. No comfort an&rsquo; not a dry stitch about her  for the last month. I&rsquo;ll tell ye what, mates, it&rsquo;s no chop this&rdquo;&mdash; The sentence  is unfinished yet, for just then a shower of spray rattles like a volley of big  hailstones against the waterproofs, followed directly by the tap of a &ldquo;comber,&rdquo;  which nearly washes the quartette into the lee scuppers, and effectually dowses  the pipes. The cook extinguishes his light in the galley, and all is cold, wet,  dark, and dreary.</p>
<p>A  simultaneous grunt of disgust bursts from our well-drenched group. &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo;  growls one, as he shakes himself, and wipes the brine out of his eyes. &ldquo;Catch  me in a Chiny clipper agin. Not if I knows it.&rdquo; Then &ldquo;eight bells&rdquo; rings  sharply out through the storm, and the groups break up and move expectantly  aft.</p>
<p>Aft,  the officer of the watch has been alternately holding on to the mizzen rigging  and glancing in the binnacle, speculating also, like the men on the main-deck,  whether or not the captain intends to shorten sail at eight o&rsquo;clock. Presently  the little apprentice, who has been creeping from the bell to the clock and  from the clock to the bell for the last half an hour, with a sigh of relief  strikes the time, and prepares himself by anticipation for a snug four hours in  the blankets, congratulating himself, as he goes to call his mates, on the  possession of a lee bunk.</p>
<p>Our  little friend, however, is premature in his calculations, for, before the sound  of the bell has quite died away, a dark form, fully equipped to make a night of  it against wind and water, emerges from the cabin hatchway, quickly followed by  another, all sea-boots and glistening waterproofs. It is the captain of the <i>Yang-tze</i> and his chief officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  she lie her course yet, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; inquires the former of the second mate,  who, for the last two hours&mdash;the second dog-watch &mdash;has had the deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half  a point to wind&rsquo;ard, sir,&rdquo; is the reply.</p>
<p>The  captain, scrupulously imitated by the first officer, takes a look at the  compass, aloft, and away to windward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umph!&rdquo;  he remarks at length, &ldquo;half a point to wind&rsquo;ard of her course. Mr. Brown, shake  the reefs out of the fore and main tops&rsquo;ls, and set the maintop-gallants&rsquo;l.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Brown stares at his superior in amazement. It is his first experience of a  homeward-bound China  clipper, and he pauses, thinking that perhaps he has not heard aright. &ldquo;Now  then, Mr. Brown, sir, hurry up, if you please. Oh, and while you&rsquo;re about it  you may as well set the jib!&rdquo; exclaims the captain impatiently. &ldquo;All hands?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Of course, sir, in weather like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  can be no mistake this time, so Mr. Brown scuttles down the poop ladder,  followed by the disappointed apprentice, both yelling out, with a kind of grim  satisfaction at the wonder and disgust with which they know the order will be  received, &ldquo;All hands make sail!&rdquo; The big black knot congregated under the break  of the poop, upon this, breaks up into methodical activity; more black knots,  only dry ones, emerge from somewhere for&rsquo;ard and join them, to be immediately  treated to a cold douche, which elicits much profanity and a universal  expression of opinion that &ldquo;the old man&rsquo;s got a screw loose somewhere, and  means to take the sticks out of the adjective hooker this time, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You  and I, friendly reader, know that this idea of Jack&rsquo;s is all nonsense. Bah!  Have we not the first teas of the season on board, Souchong, Li Chee, Bohea,  and all the rest of it; and does not our &ldquo;Old Man&rdquo; know well that, somewhere on  sea, or ocean, perhaps, wallowing, kicking, plunging, and diving, just like the <i>Yang-tze</i> herself, are five of the fastest  wedge-shaped fabrics in the world, known as clipper ships, also with their  share of the first Souchong, etc., in their holds, and all of whose &ldquo;old men&rdquo;  are every whit as determined as himself to be &ldquo;first ship home,&rdquo; and to take  the prize awarded to speed, skill, and a fair allowance of luck by the merchant  princes of London in the shape of a new hat and a cheque for a hundred pounds?  Does he not, I ask you, know and appreciate all this? Of course he does; and as  he listens to the hoarse shouts of his crew, the rattling of iron sheets  through iron sheaves, and the flapping and banging of canvas, he mutters  between his teeth, &ldquo;What you can&rsquo;t carry, my dear, you&rsquo;ll have to drag, this  trip anyhow. No <i>Titania</i> first in this  time, if I can help it.&rdquo; Then to the helmsman, &ldquo;Keep her away a couple of  points, my lad!&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, ay, sir. Keep her away, it is.&rdquo; And presently a change is  felt. A curious stillness prevails, the gale seems now to roar afar off, and  the sea to subside, nay, the topsails in a minute or two give a feeble flap  with their leaches as if almost becalmed, and the men, who have been pulling  with might and main hitherto with little effect, now easily sheet home the  sails and hoist the ponderous yards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady!  So!&rdquo; &ldquo;Steady! it is, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  a few minutes more the men are down from aloft, and, with their shipmates, cluster  aft near the cabin doors. &ldquo;Let her come!&rdquo; says the captain, as he grasps the  lee spokes of the wheel. &ldquo;Let her come, it is,&rdquo; replies the helmsman; and come  she does. You can feel her head flying up with lightning speed to meet the wind  and sea again. Whizz! rattle! roar! &ldquo;Hold on, everyone!&rdquo; and the <i>Yang-tze</i> is one mass of spray and foam  from jib-boom end to taffrail.</p>
<p>She  was simply walking a minuet before, compared to the fantastic capers that she  now cuts, at times trying to fling herself bodily out of the water, then,  giving up all idea of breasting the waves, she darts clean through them,  receiving their tops on her deck, which, even on the weather side, is up to the  men&rsquo;s knees in water.</p>
<p>Never  mind! Are not some of those other greyhounds of the sea somewhere around us, or  should be by this, or even, perhaps, but perish the thought, ahead. &ldquo;Grog ho!&rdquo;  and presently appears the steward with his tin can of rum, out of which, as he  leans at an angle of 45&deg; against the sides of his pantry, he skilfully portions  out a wineglassful, only to disappear instantly into the depths of some brawny  throat, whose owner, smacking his lips and gasping as the strong spirit takes  his breath away, steps out into the darkness to make room for the next man. &ldquo;Go  below, the watch;&rdquo; and the watch &ldquo;reel to and fro, and stagger,&rdquo; but not from  drunkenness, away to their quarters, admittance to which at present is gained  by a plunge through the curtain of green water that now pours unceasingly over  the topgallant forecastle.</p>
<p>Again  black knots cluster under the shelter of the weather bulwarks, taking their  repeated drenchings in growling submission, till, just before twelve o&rsquo;clock,  the maintopgallant-sail suddenly disappears with a sharp clap. Then the  captain, who has not left the deck, orders eight bells to be &ldquo;made,&rdquo; although  wanting yet twenty minutes of midnight, and the watch we had seen go below come  stumbling on deck once more after their short rest, to help in getting up and  bending another sail in place of the lost one, and, as the gale shows signs of  moderating, to cover the <i>Yang-tze</i> with canvas.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>In The  Trades</b></h3>
<p>Round  the Cape of Vasco da Gama, out of the territories of  the Flying Dutchman, at last, and stretching merrily away towards the South  American coast on the chance of catching the Trades strong and early, those  gentle breezes that once so sure and steady were wont to fill the mariner&rsquo;s  soul with joy. But now, alas! in this cycle of universal deterioration, this  degenerate age, like everything else, even the very elements have proved  themselves unable to escape the common fate, and have become fickle and  untrustworthy to a degree hardly to be credited.</p>
<p>Once  upon a time skippers would know almost to the eighth part of a degree  whereabouts they might depend on &ldquo;picking up their Trades,&rdquo; both north-east and  south-east. Nowadays they take looking for, and cruising about for, and, even  when found, are sometimes actually good for nothing. You may think that you  have caught them at last, and are congratulating yourself and ship, when, poof!  away they go, and leave you to roll and whistle in a calm for an indefinite  length of time. Either that or, casting their mild and steady reputations to  the winds, unmindful of all their long and honourable tradition for ease and  comfort, they howl down on you in fierce and unexpected squalls, intent,  apparently, only on seeing what amount of damage they can do in a given time.</p>
<p>In  the present instance, however, as if aware of what great interests are at  stake, they treat us somewhat better than is their usual modern custom, and  though light, blow steadily, which is all we ask of them, for the present,  anyhow, as both the crew and officers of the <i>Yang-tze</i> are quite ready for a spell; and so, having set everything  that will draw, the former bask on the now dry main-deck in the grateful  weather, whilst the latter do much the same kind of thing aft. The helmsman  nods drowsily at the wheel; and the look-out man on the forecastle head  slumbers unrebuked with a coil of the staysail down haul for his pillow. The  air is full of glorious sunshine, and the gently rippling water of life.  Discipline is relaxed, to make amends somewhat for many wild, soaking night  watches, sudden calls, and broken slumbers, which are, perhaps, more peculiarly  the lot of Jack who mans a China  tea-clipper than of all the Jacks who sail the seas in other vessels.</p>
<p>This  beatific state of things, however, is far too good to last, and, one fine  morning, just at daybreak, comes a sleepy cry from the forecastle of &ldquo;Sail on  the weather-bow, sir.&rdquo; Then, as the light breaks more fully; can be plainly  made out, with the aid of the glass, a full-rigged ship, just where sea and sky  meet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which  is she?&rdquo; is now the question. Is it the <i>Sobraon</i>?  or the <i>Titania</i>? or the <i>Black Prince</i>? coming up from the wintry  oceans that wash the shores of Magelhaen&rsquo;s Land.</p>
<p>Whichever  it may be, she comes no nearer, but at nightfall two more white specks break the  clear line of the western horizon. In vain the <i>Yang-tze</i> hoists her number and fires a gun; the distance is too  great even from the first sighted vessel to make out anything but the rig. Yet,  somehow, all hands arrive at the conclusion that these three are members of the  Tea Fleet, wherever the others may be.</p>
<p>If,  dear reader, you have quite recovered the effects of that stormy night you and  I weathered together in latitude 45&deg; south, or thereabouts, once more honour me  with your presence, as the purple flush of a tropical sunrise breaks in the  eastern skies, and I will show you a solemn and stately sight, and one,  perhaps, but seldom seen even on that mammoth stage of gorgeous spectacles, the  ocean.</p>
<p>Look,  then, over yonder to where, nearly parallel with our own vessel, and bringing  with them a stronger breeze, glide silently and steadily three white domes,  gleaming now like snow-covered bergs set in a sea of gold and amber. Watch how,  as the sun rises, he envelops them in a quivering haze of light, through which,  for a minute, they sail transfigured into ethereal vessels of fiery yellow,  moving across a background of the darkest purple. Now brighter still gleams the  orb of day, and once more the lofty clouds of canvas shine white as snow over  the long black line of hull.</p>
<p>See,  they are all three hoisting their colours; house flags at the main, and ensigns  at the gaff. Presently, from the waist of the nearest curls up a column of  white smoke, and the report of a cannon, quickly followed by three more, rolls  across the water as the <i>Yang-tze</i>,  duly returning compliments, straightens herself up to do honour to the good old  House Flag, with its bars of blue and scarlet crosswise on a white field, which  flies from the head of her main-skysail pole. <i>Titania</i>, <i>Oberon</i>, and <i>Crusader</i>, all vessels with a long and  notable list of records, and the first-named of whom is the winner of last  season&rsquo;s race, coming in a week ahead of all competitors.</p>
<p>So  the brief time of <i>dolce far niente</i> is  over on board of the <i>Yang-tze</i>, and,  in addition to the topgallant and royal studding sails, topmast and lower  ditto, water-sails, savealls, bonnets on the topsails, etc. etc., her sailmaker  is called upon to invent and improvise all manner of &ldquo;kites&rdquo; for every  conceivable corner that is likely to catch a breath of wind, innovations which  poor Jack, whose duty it is to be incessantly &ldquo;box-hauling&rdquo; them about, views  with the utmost disgust, and vows that next trip he will ship in a hay barge;  for, as he puts it, &ldquo;A feller, d&rsquo;ye see, matey, might as well be on board of a  Yankee at once, with their sky-scrapers, and moonrakers, and angel&rsquo;s  feet-ticklers, which last, when a man goes up to slow or loose &rsquo;em, d&rsquo;ye see,  he takes a week&rsquo;s tucker with him.&rdquo; But &ldquo;growl and go&rdquo; is the British sailor&rsquo;s  motto, and wise officers take no notice, find indeed that the hardest growlers  are often the best men; and so the crew of the <i>Yang-tze</i> pulled and hauled from morning till night, and all the night  through, at tacks and braces, sheets and halliards, without, perhaps, more than  the average amount of grumbles and swears inevitable in all &ldquo;box-hauling&rdquo;  processes at sea. As an adjunct, too, to all this trimming of sails and yards,  appears a small engine which clanks away monotonously as it throws great sprays  of water through its hose, aloft, nearly over the topgallant yards, wetting the  sails, and helping them to draw.</p>
<p>We  can see that our friends yonder are also piling on all the extra canvas their  masts and stays will carry. But our vessel not only holds her own, but as she  nears the famed <i>Titania</i> forges slightly  ahead. &ldquo;Will you keep us company to the Channel?&rdquo; now flies from the signal  halliards of the <i>Yang-tze</i>. &ldquo;Shall we  report you at Dover?&rdquo;  is the <i>Titania&rsquo;s</i> retort courteous, as  she regains the lost ground.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>Just  under the Equator we are now. Our S.E. friends have treated us well, indeed. Do  you see, broad on our weather-bow, that white, fleecy-looking object, almost,  to the naked eye, like a three-cornered cloud rising from the sea? That is the <i>Titania</i>&mdash;&ldquo;neck and neck&rdquo; with us for the  past ten days. On a wind, or with it a point free, even, there seems nothing to  choose between the sailing qualities of the two vessels. Nearly hull down  astern is the <i>Oberon</i>; and the <i>Crusader</i> has not been sighted since  yesterday morning. Both the last-named ships sail better with strong quarterly  winds.</p>
<p>How  blue the sky is! How tranquil the sea! The day is full of silent brightness.  Everything aloft is drawing steadily and effectively, but noiselessly. A faint  lap, lap, of wavelets against the ship&rsquo;s sides, and, every now and again, the  sharp tap of a marling-spike with which some seaman far away overhead is  putting the finishing touches to a splice, or a blockstrap, alone breaks the  stillness.</p>
<p>But  take a look through the glass. What means all that confusion on board of the <i>Titania</i> yonder? See, the white mass,  just now so compact and graceful in its outlines, seems to be suddenly  wrinkling up and falling to pieces; and hark! Is not that the report of a gun?</p>
<p>Ah!  someone else has noticed these things as well as we. Listen, as the chief  officer of the <i>Yang-tze</i>, who has been  for the last few minutes shaking the mizzen vangs in a fruitless endeavour to  dislodge a booby, who has perched himself on the very outermost end of the gaff  and fallen fast asleep, suddenly, after a quick glance to windward, leaves the  bird to its slumbers, and roars at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Hard up with your  helm! Hard up!&rdquo; Then, rushing on to the main-deck, he shouts, &ldquo;Call all hands!  Let go your sheets and halliards! Clew up skysails and royals. In stun&rsquo;sls!  Down with the jibs! Look alive, men, before the squall hits us &rdquo;</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s  a pretty kettle of fish! Caught in all our summer finery by this mad, tearing  hurricane, that flies smoking along the surface of the sea, blotting out  everything before it with a wall of mist and spray. Kind, anyhow, of our rival  to try to warn us, though, was it not? Too late, of course, but we have been  caught napping with a vengeance, and are about, despite all our efforts, to pay  the usual penalty. What a scene of confusion! Everything is let go by the  run&mdash;officers shouting; men, some in their shirts alone, just as they have  jumped out of their bunks, clewing up and hauling down. Now the wall of wind  and spray hits her. Stun&rsquo;sl booms snap like carrots, and the much-detested  &ldquo;kites&rdquo; disappear like flour in a whirlwind. Canvas, loose and torn, flaps,  flutters, and bangs in all directions. The <i>Yang-tze</i> is nearly on her beam ends, the water rushing in heaps over her lee-rail.  Crack, crack! There go the jib-boom and foretopgallant mast, the former now  hanging, with all its weight of sails, under the bows. Still the captain  hesitates to give the order to cut away the wreck, for sails and spars are  precious, and we have at no time more than we know what to do with. He stands  by the wheel, bareheaded, his long beard blowing over his shoulders, gazing,  not at the destruction that is going on aloft, but into the heart of the  squall.</p>
<p>Presently  down comes the rain, pelting us in drops as big as soup-plates. The wind lulls,  and the men manage to haul the forward wreck inboard. Now it blows harder than  ever; more canvas goes, and the fore and mizzen topgallant masts bend like whipsticks  under the terrible pressure of their half-clewed-up sails. Men snatch out their  sheath-knives, and glance at the lanyards of the weather rigging, for the lower  yardarms touch the water, and the peril is imminent and deadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady,  lads, steady!&rdquo; from the captain, who has seen something in the chaos of wind  and fury into which he has been looking so long. He has seen, too, the sailors  clustering up to windward, and knows that many another man would have sent his  masts by the board five minutes ago; hence his warning cry. For men,  uncontrolled, when face to face with death, have a habit of using their own  judgment, and not always for the best. Our captain has caught sight of a glint  of sunshine through the dark cloud, and sees that the worst is over. And, sure  enough, in a few more minutes the rain and wind both cease, the sun shines out,  and the squall roars away to the westward, leaving us, for the time, like some  great bird floating with a broken leg, and minus not a few feathers. The simile  is apt enough, only no bird in the world ever rolled as the <i>Yang-tze</i> now begins to do, as we set to  work to get things into shipshape order again.</p>
<p>The <i>Titania</i> has disappeared, and not a  speck meets the eye all round the horizon.</p>
<p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Up Channel</b></h3>
<p>Wrap  yourself up well during this last short cruise, courteous reader, for we are in  the chops of the English Channel, and the air  is cold and damp, the wind blows shrill, and it is dim and foggy even at  midday. No sun has been visible for the last twenty-four hours, and the ship,  under short canvas, scarcely seems to move through the dull green water.</p>
<p>Of  the <i>Titania</i> we have seen nothing  since we left her in that terrible and sudden squall under the Line, and for  aught we know she may have foundered in it. However, we all sincerely hope that  such is not the case, and long to get some news of her.</p>
<p>No  cracking on now, for your long-voyage captain gets cautious to the verge of  timidity as he approaches his native shores, encircled, as they so often are,  with thick fogs and deadly breakers roaring on jagged rocks and treacherous  beaches.</p>
<p>We  are in soundings, too, and the deep-sea lead is kept going constantly. &ldquo;White  sand and shells&rdquo; is the last message from the bottom that follows the long-drawn  cry of &ldquo;Watch, there! watch!&rdquo; as the ponderous conical-shaped mass of lead,  with its hollow bottom and &ldquo;arming&rdquo; of tallow, is hove overboard out of the  fore rigging, the line slipping from hand to hand along the ship&rsquo;s rail aft, as  she slowly surges ahead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere  off the Scillys, or thereabouts,&rdquo; seems to be the prevailing impression on  board; although no one except the captain, and perhaps his chief mate, can  speak with certainty, and those two keep their ideas to themselves at present</p>
<p>Look-outs  are stationed all over the ship. Heavy, yellow, and thick, the fog settles  down&mdash;true &ldquo;London  mixture.&rdquo; The wind is easterly, and our course should be about E.S.E.; and we  tack and head-reach and box about in a seemingly blind and aimless kind of  manner, as if we had lost something and were feeling for it.</p>
<p>Two  years ago the <i>Yang-tze</i>, under charge  of her Chinese pilot, to his utter amazement and indignation, dared to get  ashore on the Min   River. In his own  language he cursed and swore at the foreign devils who composed her officers  and crew for idiots and blockheads; then refused to pilot the vessel a foot  farther until two great eyes were painted, one on each bow. &ldquo;Hah,&rdquo; he  exclaimed; &ldquo;s&rsquo;pose um no hal eye, how can see um way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  the eyes were put on by his own artists, and, through some &ldquo;fad&rdquo; of the captain&rsquo;s,  there they were yet; and precious little use they seemed to the good ship in  her present dilemma, despite the dictum of her whilom Celestial guide. So the <i>Yang-tze</i>, under three close-reefed  topsails, foresail, and storm-staysail, jogs along, zigzag fashion, through the  leaden-coloured water; and says one of the crew, as she is put about for the  twentieth time in the last half an hour, &ldquo;Dash this fog! I wonders where we are!  Up the British Channel, I believe, for all any of the after-guard knows about  it!&rdquo; Then up and spake a sailor old: &ldquo;Bah! This ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to what I&rsquo;ve  seed! If we&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had some skippers as I&rsquo;ve sailed with, we&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been lyin&rsquo;  snug an cumfabble in the West Indy dock long afore this. I tells ye what, young  feller,&rdquo;&mdash;to the ordinary seaman who had first spoken,&mdash;&ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t begun to live  yet! Why, when I was in the old <i>Dreadnought</i>&mdash;Western  Ocean packet ship she were&mdash;one trip, we starts away out o&rsquo; the Nelson Dock, at  Liverpool, as it might be to-night, an&rsquo; all the way over you couldn&rsquo;t see your  hand afore you with the fog&mdash;that thick you could cut it off and chuck it about  in fistfuls. Well, d&rsquo;ye see, we jogs along, sometimes with a fair wind, an&rsquo;  sometimes with a head un; an&rsquo;, damn me! but the first thing we knocks up agin  turns out to be the old hooker&rsquo;s own jetty where she always used to lie up the Hudson at New    York. An&rsquo; what&rsquo;s more, that same day, the fog bein&rsquo;  thicker &rsquo;n ever, our skipper, says he, &lsquo;Boys,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;we can&rsquo;t see much, but  I guess we oughter be close to No. 6&rsquo;&mdash;which, d&rsquo;ye understand, my son, was the  number o&rsquo; the jetty&mdash;an&rsquo;, with that, she hits it bump. Now that&rsquo;s what I calls  dead reck&rsquo;ning if&rdquo;&mdash; &nbsp;&ldquo;Ready about!  Stations!&rdquo; and the old tar, leaving his stiff &ldquo;bender&rdquo; unfinished, waddles away  to the fore sheet.</p>
<p>It  does not do to trust to eyes in weather like this, so the big bell is kept  constantly going, and a terrible instrument, known as a fog-horn, blares out  every now and again, for we are surrounded with invisible shipping, huddled  together like a flock of sheep, beating about and head-reaching, waiting  impatiently for a chance to slip up to London, and only too happy if they can  but manage to hold their own at the entrance of the &ldquo;Silver Streak&rdquo; till a fair  wind comes.</p>
<p>Through  the mist on all sides of us we hear more bells and horns, with, at times, a  hoarse, screeching whistle, long continued, telling of a happy steamer  independently coming out or in.</p>
<p>Ha!  What&rsquo;s this? We have long ago furled our foresail and mizzen-topsail, and now  comes the order to set them again. Not only that, but to shake out a couple of  reefs. Our captain has evidently made up his mind to beat farther up for a tug  or a pilot Well, so be it! &ldquo;A cocked hat or Westminster Abbey!&rdquo; &ldquo;First ship  home,&rdquo; or the <i>Yang-tze&rsquo;s</i> bones on a  lee shore.</p>
<p>Thicker  now than ever hangs the fog. The breeze freshens to almost a gale, and all that  night little is heard between the blaring horn and clanging bell but cries of &ldquo;Ready  about!&rdquo; &ldquo;Stations!&rdquo; &ldquo;Helm a-lee!&rdquo; &ldquo;Tacks and sheets!&rdquo; as we make short legs and  shorter ones up Channel.</p>
<p>In  one of our turns we nearly run into a ship anchored in mid-channel, and on  board of which they are apparently hard at work, beating with might and main  upon the cooking utensils. She only looks like a heavier lump of fog than  usual, as we surge past her, but a loud shouting and yelling tells us that we  have both had a narrow escape. Where the deuce are we? A ship anchored in  mid-channel! We must be getting pretty high up! And so our captain appears to  think, for he orders our two 18-pounders to be loaded, and fired at short  intervals. Blue lights and rockets, too, hiss and splutter, and flare damply  through the fog. Presently an empty tar-cask is lashed to the end of a stunsail  boom, set on fire, and thrust outboard, throwing a yellow glare over the fore  part of the vessel.</p>
<p>About  midnight we are boxing off and on again now under short sail. A hoarse cry of &ldquo;Ship  ahoy!&rdquo; comes up out of the fog on our port quarter. Ah! the pilot cutter at  last! and in a very few minutes the pilot himself, dripping and shiny, steps on  board. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do? Nastyish weather! Starboard fore tawps&rsquo;l braces a pull!  There, belay all that! <i>Yang-tze</i>, eh?  Knew it must be somebody making such a darned row! Flatten in those head-sheets,  mister&rdquo; (to the chief officer). &ldquo;<i>Titania</i>?  No, we haven&rsquo;t seen anything of her. Bad weather for seeing, this! Fire four  guns, quick&rsquo;s you can. The Company&rsquo;s tug is knocking about close to us  somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  pilot and skipper go below for a few minutes, and presently the former comes up  alone and takes full charge of the vessel; whilst the latter, who has not  closed his eyes for three days and nights, turns in for a little well-earned  repose.</p>
<p>We  are abreast of Dover,  and soon after the last discharge of our artillery, which blows a clear hole in  the fog for about five hundred yards around us, the tugboat, chartered by the  Company who owns the <i>Yang-tze</i>, comes  up and takes us in tow.</p>
<p>Of  our rival nothing appears to have been seen or heard, and, whilst rejoicing in  our victory, many are the doubts and fears expressed for her safety, and the  majority of the <i>Yang-tze&rsquo;s</i> crew  appear to think that she went down in the squall. Some few, however, hold to  the belief that she is still knocking about with the fleet at the entrance of  the Channel.</p>
<p>It  is evening again ere we get to Gravesend; a murky, foggy, cold evening it is  too, as we slip gently along towards the buoy that marks the end of our  voyage&mdash;it is the same one that we left nearly nine months ago&mdash;and to which we  intend to &ldquo;tie up&rdquo; for the night. It is getting dark, and our anchor light  rises like a patch of dirty yellow up the fore rigging. So now to make fast&mdash;a  wet job a night like this.</p>
<p>Ah!  another homeward-bounder, bent apparently on the same errand. How vague and shapeless  she looms through the fog!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port!&rdquo;  shouts our pilot, as the new-comer draws dangerously near. &ldquo;Port your hel-um!  Do you want to run into us?&rdquo; &ldquo;Ay, ay, port it is!&rdquo; comes the gruff answer. The  stranger however, has rather too much way on, and only by a sharp pull from her  tug does she clear us. Dark figures crowd the side nearest to the <i>Yang-tze</i>, and we are so close to each  other that, as she draws slowly ahead, we can see the glimmer from the binnacle  lamp shining on the face of the helmsman as he peers through the gloom at us.</p>
<p>Our  skipper has come on deck again, and, after a sharp look at the indistinct mass,  now a cable&rsquo;s length away, he sings out sharply to the second mate, &ldquo;Hail her,  Mr. Brown.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ship ahoy!&rdquo; roars that officer. &ldquo;What ship&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Titania</i>, from China. What ship&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; &ldquo;<i>Yang-tze</i>, from China.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  loud murmur of surprise arises from each vessel, and then a burst of hearty  cheering, sounding strangely hollow and distant through the fog, is renewed  again and again; and says our captain, &ldquo;I thought as much! A dead heat, by the  Lord Harry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ACruiseinaCutter"></a>A Cruise in  a Cutter</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>1</b></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Two  &rsquo;ands an&rsquo; a mate wanted for the <i>Ruby</i>,  cutter,&rdquo; was the cry that fell on my ear, as I lounged one morning in the  doorway of the Melbourne Sailors&rsquo; Home, in which building was also situated the  Shipping Office.</p>
<p>It  was a hot, dusty, stifling summer&rsquo;s day&mdash; just such a one as would call up  thoughts of the blue sky and fresh breezes out at sea, far away from the  scorching streets, grimy wharfs, and perspiring population of the great  colonial city. As I listened, I wondered within myself what kind of life a man  would lead in a craft like the &ldquo;<i>Ruby</i>,  cutter,&rdquo; for I had always been accustomed to large ships, and had not long left  one of nearly 2000 tons burden.</p>
<p>I  looked curiously at the group around the door of the office to see the &ldquo;two &rsquo;ands  an&rsquo; a mate&rdquo; step forward; but no one seemed inclined to make a move. Presently  out walked &mdash;or, to speak by the card, &ldquo;limped&rdquo;&mdash;a little shrivelled-up man,  whose left leg was considerably shorter than its fellow, and whose look,  manner, and bearing were the direct opposite of everything sailor-like.  Addressing the men in a half-pleading, half-remonstrant tone, he said, &ldquo;Now  then, boys, come along. It&rsquo;s a good trip&mdash;right round to Fremantle, and, mebbe, Champion Bay into the bargain. Six pounds a  month, and a month&rsquo;s advance if you want it. You all knows the boat. Now then,  who sez?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  captin,&rdquo; replied one of the men, &ldquo;as you sez, we most on us know the little  hooker, an&rsquo; what we reckons is that she&rsquo;s too small for a trip like that, with  nothin&rsquo; livelier aboard nor iron an&rsquo; bricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pish!&rdquo;  muttered the old skipper, as he hopped up to me, saying, &ldquo;Come now, young  feller, I can see you&rsquo;re a big ship man, but I&rsquo;ll take you if you like to sign.  You&rsquo;ll be chief officer, greaser, third, and bo&rsquo;sn all rolled into one, an&rsquo; if  that&rsquo;s not a rise for a man I&rsquo;d like to know what is. Eight pound a month you&rsquo;ll  get, an&rsquo; the very best o&rsquo; tucker. Never mind these bumboat men here,&rdquo; he went  on. &ldquo;They want a steamer or they ain&rsquo;t happy. Afraid they are o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; some o&rsquo;  the ile an&rsquo; coal-dust washed off of &rsquo;em in anythin&rsquo; smaller &rsquo;n a three-decker.  Ugh!&rdquo; and the old fellow snorted his disgust, looking intensely comical as,  standing for a moment on one leg, he surveyed the laughing faces of the  coasting seamen around him.</p>
<p>However,  from his very oddity I had taken a liking to him, and had already made up my  mind that I would see Western    Australia in his company. As to any more than usual  risk I might be running, that did not trouble me in the least, partly, no  doubt, through ignorance; for, like the majority of men who have passed their  lives in large ships, I had very little idea of the working of a small one, and  how very much more against her would tell a cargo of dead weight in a heavy  sea, proportionally, than in the great vessels I had been accustomed to. The  coasting sailors, on the contrary, were well aware that the <i>Ruby</i>, laden with heavy machinery up to  her chain-plates, was a risky craft in which to face the seas, breaking in all  their unchecked might against the Leeuwin, and were naturally and rightly  doubtful of trusting their lives in her. Besides, they had seen her; I had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  along,&rdquo; said the little old man, after I had duly signed articles as mate of  the cutter &mdash;whilst leading the way to a neighbouring hotel, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll have a  bottle of beer this thirsty day, and then go down an&rsquo; look at the ship. I&rsquo;ll  pick up a couple of hands somewhere before night; and the cook&rsquo;s aboard  already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <i>Ruby</i> was lying at one of the Yarra  wharfs; and so wonderfully small did she appear to me, that I audibly expressed  my doubts as to being able to keep from stepping quietly overboard in the dark  some time or other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  fear,&rdquo; replied the skipper. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon get used to her. An&rsquo; let me tell you,  mister, that me an&rsquo; the little ship there&rsquo;s weathered many a blow that would ha&rsquo;  given some o&rsquo; your big square-rigged uns all they know&rsquo;d how to get through  with. Dry as a cork she is, too, when them others is a-pooping of theirselves.  A wicked little villian she&rsquo;s bin in her day, too,&rdquo; he went on, leering  affectionately at the cutter. &ldquo;Used to go a-blackbird catching &rsquo;way down &rsquo;mong  the Islands yonder, an&rsquo; used to get fired on  times without number. Got dozens o&rsquo; bullets driv hard an&rsquo; fast into her timbers  yet. But she&rsquo;s no cripple for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  truth, the <i>Ruby</i> was a smart-looking  boat of some 70 tons, with a main-boom nearly as long as herself, and very  lofty lower and top masts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep!&rdquo;  exclaimed the skipper, in reply to an observation I made. &ldquo;Of course she&rsquo;s  deep. But many a time she&rsquo;s been deeper, a-comin&rsquo; from Warrnambool yonder with  a load o&rsquo; spuds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  did not then know that my commander&rsquo;s voyaging had been mainly confined to that  trade, and that the farthest trip he had ever made had been one to Circular  Head in Tasmania.</p>
<p>Next  morning, at daybreak, a little coffeepot of a tug-boat took us down the Yarra,  and in Hobson&rsquo;s Bay left us to our own devices.</p>
<p>The  captain had been successful in securing a couple of men somewhere&mdash;one evidently  a deep-water sailor, and, like myself, accustomed to large ships, the other a  coaster of the usual type, who seemed perfectly at home directly he stepped on  board. Off Williamstown, another man was pulled alongside in a waterman&rsquo;s boat.  He offered to work his passage to Fremantle, and the skipper, after some  hesitation, consenting, a round-bottomed chest, that is, a long canvas bag,  full of clothes, was bundled on deck, and the new-comer descended into the  stifling little den of a forecastle below, in the eyes of the cutter.</p>
<p>Our  quarters aft were almost as limited as those of the crew for&rsquo;ard, there just  being room in the cuddy for a couple of curtained bunks, a small table, a  bookshelf, and sundry lockers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snug,&rdquo;  said the old man, &ldquo;an&rsquo; cumfable.&rdquo; So it was, perhaps; but it was also close,  and smelt vilely of rum, tobacco, onions, and bilge water.</p>
<p>The  wind was fair down the Bay, and only delaying to take in a most generous supply  of fresh beef, bread, and vegetables, away we went, with our main-boom sticking  out over the water, almost at right angles to the cutter, and as if hardly  belonging to her at all. The man at the tiller&mdash;&ldquo;rib puncher,&rdquo; he called it&mdash;was  composedly smoking a short pipe. The cook at the galley door was peeling  potatoes. The crew lounged about the deck, and the skipper, seated on the skylight,  with his spectacles on, was deep in one of Miss Braddon&rsquo;s novels.</p>
<p>It  was such a total change, such a broad contrast to the style of seafaring in  which I had been educated, that I was fairly puzzled what to be at on a vessel  where all my preconceived notions, gained by experience, of maritime discipline  and dignity were so utterly routed, where all was carried on on the <i>dolce far niente</i> system, and Jack,  apparently, was as good as his master.</p>
<p>I  have an inborn distaste for disturbing any established order of things if they  are at all bearable; so, giving a last look at the dirty decks, which sadly  wanted a scrub, and at the standing rigging, which would have been much the  better for a good setting-up, I sat down alongside the captain, who, I may here  take the opportunity of remarking, was also sole owner of the little craft.</p>
<p>Presently  looking up from his book, he said, &ldquo;Was you ever at Swan River,  Mr. Brown?&rdquo; and, on my replying in the negative, he continued, &ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose  well fetch it all right, somehow or other. Landmarks is plain an&rsquo; plentiful, so  I&rsquo;ve been told, right round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  started at this, you may be sure; and it suddenly occurred to me that I had  observed no vestige, since I had been on the <i>Ruby</i>, of any of the appliances, such as charts, sextant, etc.,  generally connected with the science of navigation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I presently ventured; &ldquo;but if we are to follow the coast-line to Fremantle, we  shall, I fancy, make rather a long trip of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it, sir,&rdquo; replied the old fellow. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do as the steamers do, cut  off a corner here an&rsquo; a corner there; run across a bight, an&rsquo; stand off now an&rsquo;  agen to weather a bluff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposing  we should get blown out to sea, altogether away from the land?&rdquo; I questioned,  aghast at this radical departure from all recognised rules, yet so thoroughly  in keeping with everything around me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  then, haven&rsquo;t we got our compass?&rdquo; indignantly replied the master, as he again  buried himself in <i>Aurora Floyd</i>.</p>
<p>With  the spanking breeze we carried, we cleared the land before dark, and at eight  bells the Otway was distant barely a mile on our starboard hand. The captain,  giving the course as W. &frac12; North, we went down to get our tea. The meal over,  the old man, after much rummaging in one of the lockers amongst a varied  assortment of papers, fishing-lines, hanks of marline, and the like, brought to  light a ragged, dirty chart, a quadrant,&mdash;the figures on whose arc were  indistinguishable from age and dirt,&mdash; a pair of carpenter&rsquo;s callipers, and an  ordinary flat wooden ruler.</p>
<p>Placing  these articles on the table and regarding them complacently, he remarked&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  could see as you were put out, mister, when I spoke o&rsquo; hugging the land too  close, so I thought as how I&rsquo;d hunt up these tools, which I haven&rsquo;t used since  I made that trip to the Circular Head, nine years agone now. I fetched within  two mile, an&rsquo; that, you&rsquo;ll allow, wasn&rsquo;t bad work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  allow,&rdquo; I answered, as I looked disconsolately at the &ldquo;tools,&rdquo; &ldquo;that it was by  the special mercy of Providence  that you fetched anywhere with such things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  perhaps they ain&rsquo;t right up to big-ship style,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But, you see, I  ain&rsquo;t had much occasion for such. Look here,&rdquo; and, unfolding the chart, which I  now observed to my disgust was only for a portion of the S.W. coast of Victoria,  he pointed to a thick black stroke reaching from Warmambool in a slight curve  to Cape Otway, then turning up the bay and through the South Channel to  Williams-town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;I could smell my way along that road, blow high or low, dark or shine.  But if you think that you can do any better with these here tools, why, you&rsquo;re  welcome to &rsquo;em, an&rsquo; I can&rsquo;t say any more, can I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  despaired of making such a man sensible of the immense difference that existed  between a trip of a few miles along the coast, every inch of which was as well  known to him as was Spencer or Bourke Street, and almost as well lighted, and  one of a thousand miles on which the land might be sighted but twice or thrice.  However, I attempted to put the case plainly before him, and in the course of  our conversation I was astonished to find that he possessed only a vague notion  of where Fremantle really was. His one idea seemed that of following the coast  till he arrived there; and it was not till I drew for him the shape of the  southern seaboard, stretching away into the head of the Great Bight, then  trending south and west again to King George&rsquo;s Sound, that he appeared to  realise the magnitude of the adventure he had hurriedly undertaken. Tenders, it  seemed, had been called by a party of working miners for the transportation of  a small engine and boiler with a quantity of bricks to the site of what they  deemed would turn out a second Potosi,  in the far Western colony. The master of the <i>Ruby</i> cutter had obtained the freight,&mdash;had, indeed, been the only  tenderer for the contract,&mdash;and forthwith replenishing his rum-keg and  harness-casks, and in a few hours putting his lading on board, had set out with  a stout heart and a faith in his own resources which were perfectly touching,  to convey it to its destination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said the skipper, at length nearly convinced, &ldquo;we must only make the  best of a bad job now. Trust in Providence,  I say, an&rsquo; stick to the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  may have too much of the land before we sight the Leeuwin,&rdquo; I answered, irritably  enough, as he went on deck.</p>
<p>Left  to myself, I overhauled the bookcase, the contents of which I found to consist  solely of Miss Braddon&rsquo;s novels&mdash;not another work of any description.</p>
<p>Now,  clever as that lady is, and deservedly popular as are many of her writings,  their most ardent admirers will acknowledge that a perusal of them, no matter  how diligent and appreciative, will do very little towards solving a problem of  latitude and longitude at sea. So I may be forgiven for confessing that it was  with feelings of no little contempt for the student of the volumes before me  that I at last banged to the door of the bookcase.</p>
<p>We  sailed along comfortably enough for a couple of days, sometimes pretty close  inshore, at others in bare sight of it, till, one evening, being somewhere  between Cape Northumberland and Lacepede Bay, steering a course that would have  run us dead on to Kangaroo Island, we caught a southerly buster &mdash; or perhaps it  would be more accurate to say that it caught us&mdash;and I thought, for a while,  that a prolonged stay in Davy Jones&rsquo; locker was to be our next experience.</p>
<p>But  the <i>Ruby</i>, handicapped as she was,  proved herself a sea-boat of no common order. Nor, at this crisis, was her  master found wanting. Flinging, for the time, and literally, Miss Braddon to  the winds, he stood at the tiller and bellowed out his orders in a manner that  showed he knew well what he was about. The sea got up with tremendous rapidity,  and soon fairly swept the cutter&rsquo;s decks. I had never before, from a like  standpoint, seen anything to equal it; and as I clung gasping and choking to  the rigging, I thought that we must inevitably founder.</p>
<p>Happily,  the <i>Ruby</i> was not troubled with bulwarks,  iron stanchions with a chain rove through their tops taking their place, so  that the water went off nearly as quickly as it came on; but the pressure upon  the deck and hatches must have been tremendous.</p>
<p>At  nightfall the buster turned into a regular S.W. gale, and the cutter, under a  goosewinged mainsail and close-reefed foresail, lay-to like a log awash. Every  movable thing was carried off her decks, including our one boat, which  disappeared on the top of a great comber, looking for all the world just like a  sheet of white paper in the gloom.</p>
<p>Luckily  the weather was beautifully warm, and, no one seeming to care about going  below, all secured themselves to the rigging in some fashion or another.</p>
<p>The  scene as I gazed upon it from my perch between the iron bars that did duty as  crosstrees was grand and appalling beyond anything that in the course of a long  seafaring career I had ever before witnessed. The tall solitary mast swept in  wild, dizzily-swaying arcs, plunging, trembling, and jumping, as if  endeavouring to shake off into the hissing foam below the black dots so  tenaciously clinging to it. Presently, a great roaring giant of a billow would  break over the cutter, the spray from which flew in showers over the lower  masthead, clattering like volleys of hail against the rag of canvas, and  stinging our hands and faces like gravel. Hardly would the little craft have  time to shake herself, ere another monster, appearing to rise exactly  underneath her, would bear us up, up, up, as it seemed, to a tremendous height,  then, slipping away, down she shot swiftly with flapping sail between two steep  walls of water into a momentarily calm and windless gulf, only to be directly  hove up again, quivering and straining in every timber, and with the water  pouring from her in sheets fore and aft. Overhead the stars shone fiercely out  of a clear sky, against whose horizon the tumbling masses of water stood up in  ever-disappearing relief like black hills.</p>
<p>I was  never seasick in my life, but I believe, that I was very near to being so  whilst clinging to that whirling, madly-gyrating cutter&rsquo;s mast, whose rigging,  despite a faint protest from the old skipper, I was now more than ever glad  that I had insisted on thoroughly overhauling.</p>
<p>The  old fellow himself was hanging on close beside me as chirpy and lively as a  cricket, chewing away at a great plug of tobacco. Presently came a lull in the  everlasting rush and roar of commingled blast and water, and he shouted, &ldquo;By  Gosh, mister, I never seed her ship it afore like this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dry  as a cork, eh?&rdquo; I bawled back sarcastically. &ldquo;Catch me in a cutter again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  this moment someone shouted the single word &ldquo;Breakers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  there, away to leeward under the stars, shone a long, bright, white line of  surf, looking as if drawn by some magical pencil across the dark wilderness of  jumbled sea.</p>
<p>The  old captain&rsquo;s navigation might be somewhat faulty, but of his courage and  sterling practical seamanship there could be no doubt. And now, whilst yelling  out, &ldquo;On deck all hands! Reefs out o&rsquo; the mains&rsquo;l!&rdquo; he set the example himself,  cheering and encouraging everyone; agile as a grasshopper, strong as a little  lion, he flew about, pulling, commanding, and directing in a way that seemed to  me, when I thought of it afterwards, as little less than wonderful.</p>
<p>With  infinite labour and difficulty we at length, after many narrow escapes of being  washed overboard, got our throat and peak halliards to the winch and shook out  the thundering canvas to the gale.</p>
<p>The  white streak was now so close that it actually appeared to seethe and bubble  just under the cutter&rsquo;s bows, whilst ahead loomed, hardly distinguishable from  the black rollers themselves, a steady mass whence came the dread sound that,  once heard as we heard it then, in after-years wakes men from their sleep with  hair all damp and terror at their hearts&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The  sound of the trampling surf<br>
On the rocks and the hard sea-sand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heeling  over to the blast till her lee gunwale was six feet under water, and the lower  mast bent like a fishing-rod, the <i>Ruby</i>,  only half alive though she was, gallantly held her own, and, as she gradually  gathered way, the glistening lines of roaring foam where lay hidden certain  destruction, swift and merciless, grew dimmer and dimmer astern, and their  booming broke more dully on the ear as we tediously but hopefully thrashed to  windward in our struggle through the long dark hours.</p>
<p>It  was a terrible fight, but we conquered. And as daylight came, dull and  threatening, we continued to make good our offing from the rockbound coast on  whose reefs we had been so nearly lost.</p>
<p>All  that day the gale blew steadily, veering gradually round to the eastward. In  the evening I had a long talk with the skipper, the outcome of which was that  he agreed to put into Port Adelaide and discharge some of the cargo before  venturing any farther. Next morning we sighted Cape Willoughby;  and as we rapidly rose the land on the other side of Backstairs Passage, I soon  picked up marks familiar enough in days long gone by. That night we bring up  under the lee of Point Marsden, and next day, with a fair wind, we rattle up  the Gulf to the Semaphore in great style. Another few hours see us snugly moored  alongside one of the wharfs in the Port, and so ends the first portion of my  cruise.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>2</b></h3>
<p>Down  the Gulf of St. Vincent again, after a stay in port  only of forty-eight hours, out into the open sea, and, to our commander&rsquo;s  manifest uneasiness, unable to catch even a glimpse of the land. For two whole  days has this been so; and he is on deck incessantly, peering through a long,  heavy telescope towards the direction in which he knows the coast must lie.  Miss Braddon has lost all her charms for him. He regards me suspiciously, and  with doubtful looks. Having by this time fallen somewhat into the ways of the <i>Ruby</i>, cutter, I challenge the old man to  a game at draughts and get ignominiously beaten, whereupon he seems pleased;  but, happening to glance landwards, and seeing nothing but sky and blue water,  he grows grave again, and commences to relate the, by now, old, old, story of  that memorable voyage to Tasmania, and of the wonderful land-fall he then made.  I have been told since, though, that he had, at first, mistaken King&rsquo;s Island  for Tasmania,  nearly, in consequence, running the <i>Ruby</i> on the Navarine rocks before he discovered his error. Peace be to his ashes,  and to those of his little boat, too! Both are gone, and both, in their own  way, were equally good.</p>
<p>We  are sailing across the Great Australian Bight now; and, much as I should like  to reassure him by giving him a sight of land, cannot, without flying in the  face of Providence and a fair wind that is sending us merrily along.</p>
<p>From  this it will be guessed that I have been appointed sailing-master of the <i>Ruby</i>. In Adelaide I had invested privately, and on my  own account, in a good second-hand quadrant, a <i>Norrie&rsquo;s Epitome, Nautical Almanac</i>, and a few others things,  including a capital chart of the W. and S.W. coasts.</p>
<p>For  the first day or so after losing sight of Cape  Borda the skipper had kept so close in  that I had imagined he was for exploring Spencer&rsquo;s Gulf and the Banks Group,  actually, as we did, getting right under Cape Catastrophe.</p>
<p>My  recollections of a lee-shore were still too vivid not to make me protest  against this dodging in and out, which, in spite of my former lecture, he still  persisted in. At length, one evening, he gets a thorough fright. We are poking  about amongst the Four Hummocks, close to the Whidby Isles, when the cutter  grates and grinds along over something considerably harder than herself, as  evidenced by splinters of her keel, white and fresh-looking, floating alongside  as she slides over the obstruction into deep water again. I tell him that the  whole coast right along bristles with such things, requesting him at the same  time, if he must keep in sight of the shore, at least to do so at a decent  distance. Presently it comes on to blow pretty freshly from the north-east. He  asks me the correct course to make the Leeuwin. I tell him that to reach the  Leeuwin from where we are now, we shall have to go overland if we wish to go  direct; so shape a course for the Sound. And thus it is that we have been so  long away from the coast, and hence the old man&rsquo;s fits of fidgetiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sail  ho!&rdquo; now shouts one of the crew, who has been looking around during an interval  of dealing out a dirty pack of cards, with which both watches are engaged in a  game of &ldquo;cut-throat&rdquo; euchre, whilst lying basking in the warm sun.</p>
<p>It  is a steamer coming directly for us; an immense ocean mail-boat&mdash;from Albany last, most likely.  As she approaches nearer and nearer we can hear the deep throbbing of her  engines, and make out her port side, from for&rsquo;ard right aft, lined with faces  gazing with eager curiosity at the cutter. Nearer still, and keeping away a  point, she gives a long heave over towards us, exposing to view the whole  breadth of her snowy decks, the open hatchways, with their pendant, inflated  windsails, and her polished brasswork gleaming like jets of yellow flame in the  sunlight. Presently, dark faces, grinning whitely, mingle with the others. Her  Lascar firemen have come up for a minute&rsquo;s fresh air and a look at the  stranger.</p>
<p>Aft,  underneath the broad awning, we catch a glimpse of white shimmering drapery and  scarlet uniforms &mdash; these last, as we learn afterwards, belonging to viceroyalty  and its suite, bound Adelaideward. Now, up she rises again and surges past the <i>Ruby</i> in all her majesty of bulk and  steam. Now, the ensign flutters aloft to her peak. We gravely dip ours, which I  have frantically rushed below and snatched from the head of the skipper&rsquo;s  bunk&mdash;he loves a high pillow. Three times I raise and lower it in parting salute  from the pigmy, as courteously returned from the giant, on whose stern, as  churning a wide wake of snowy foam, it slides along, we read <i>Atrato</i>.</p>
<p>The  next day, a long distance away to the northward, we sight some small rocky  islets, and, beyond them again, can make out the mainland, lying low, like a  blue haze upon the water. The group of rocks is the Recherche Archipelago, and,  altering our course more southerly, we next morning run past the entrance to  King George&rsquo;s Sound&mdash; the old captain absorbed in placid contentment and <i>The Trail of the Serpent</i>. Then sighting  D&rsquo;Entrecasteaux, we bear up against a north-east wind, with the grey old Leeuwin,  washed smooth and bare by the seas of centuries, rising grimly on our starboard  bow.</p>
<p>Off  Cape Naturaliste a strange incident happened,  and one that had nearly brought our cruise to an untimely end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that there rock ahead on us laid down in your chart, Mr. Brown, sir?&rdquo; asked the  skipper one fine afternoon; he had of late become deferential in the extreme.  Looking through the glass, I saw, about a couple of points on the port bow, a  large dark object. Presently I thought I saw it move, and then it suddenly  disappeared altogether. Turning to the captain, I was about to make some joking  remark, when all at once the cutter began to heel slowly over till the end of  her main-boom touched the water. We were running along at the time with a light  breeze nearly aft. Then, as we clambered up to windward, thoroughly scared, she  gradually righted again, and there appeared, overtopping the deck by many feet,  a monstrous mass, black and shining, from which the water poured down upon us  in streams. It was an enormous whale.</p>
<p>And  as, holding on to the guard-chain, we gazed upwards in wonder and alarm, over  went the poor little <i>Ruby</i> once more,  whilst, as she went, the great beast&rsquo;s side closely followed hers with a  rasping, grating sound, caused, as we soon saw, by millions of barnacles and  other parasites of every description that adhered to his skin, and which fell  off in showers as he rubbed delightedly and vigorously against his extempore  scratching-post.</p>
<p>Once  he paused, and, submerging the rest of his body, he rose a huge, semicircular  head, till now out of sight, fairly above and resting against the vessel&rsquo;s  side. So close were we that had there been such an organ visible, and had we  been so inclined, we could have pulled his nose.</p>
<p>For  the space of, perhaps, a couple of minutes, we all&mdash;for the crew had by this run  aft&mdash;stood and looked leviathan squarely in the face. Small, round, unwinking,  expressionless black eyes were they that stared at us so intently. I was just  wondering to myself whether his next move would be an attempt to come inboard  altogether, when he suddenly opened wide a pair of monstrous jaws, the passage  between which looked large enough for cutter, crew, and cargo to have slid down  with ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  holy Moses!&rdquo; shouted the skipper, in terror, as he hastily drew back, closely  followed by the rest of us to the far side, whilst the whale, as if startled by  the invocation, spouted columns of water into the air, rising as high as the  masthead, and falling in tons on deck, swamping and drenching everything.</p>
<p>After  thoroughly ducking us, he disappeared, and we began to hope that we had seen  the last of him.</p>
<p>But  no; just as the <i>Ruby</i> was gathering  way again he returned, only this time on the opposite side, and recommenced the  same scraping process.</p>
<p>The  affair was becoming both irritating and disquieting, as its first novelty and  impressiveness wore off.</p>
<p>But  we kept as still as mice, for we were afraid that if we interfered with him in  any way he might take it into his thick head to exterminate us with one sweep  of the great tail that, at times, came so perilously near to the <i>Ruby&rsquo;s</i> bowsprit-end. He completely  stopped the cutter&rsquo;s way, pushing her over, and backwards and forwards, just as  he pleased; rubbing off, not only his encumbrances, but paint and wood, in which  last he made deep scores and streaks; the side he had done with looking as if  some Brobdignagian marine artist had been trying his hand at &ldquo;cross-hatching&rdquo;  with lumps of coral.</p>
<p>At  one time, so hard, and with such force did the beast scrape and push against, I  suppose, a more than usually obstinate and thickly-populated spot, that the  cutter fairly put her port-rail under water up to the main hatch, nearly  floating off its chocks the new long-boat we had obtained in Port Adelaide. I  thought, for a moment, that it was all over with us; but, just in the nick of  time, the brute settled back, followed by the <i>Ruby</i>.</p>
<p>That  we were in the embraces of an unusually-sized predicament as well as in those  of a whale, was not to be denied, and how to get free of the thing puzzled us  monstrously. I recalled to mind everything I had either heard or read of the  animal and its habits, or, rather, I attempted to do so; but, for the life of  me, I could think of nothing bearing on the subject in hand but the ancient  story of Jonah, whose fate, popularly, if erroneously, attributed for ages to a  member of the same family as that of our too-loving friend, had in childhood&rsquo;s  days made such a deep and lasting impression on my mind.</p>
<p>It  seemed pretty certain, however, that if, as scientists averred, he could not  possibly swallow anything larger than a sprat (although that discovery did not  occur to me till afterwards), still that he would, if he stayed much longer  with us, capsize our vessel or scrape clean through her timbers &mdash; either contingency  about on a par as far as ourselves were concerned.</p>
<p>He  also, to add to our bewilderment, began to make a curious kind of loud grunting  noise, expressive probably of satisfaction, and to move more slowly and  indolently, pausing for long intervals, but still sticking so close to the  cutter as to render all progress impossible.</p>
<p>And  now our cook had an idea. Creeping into his galley, he filled a big wooden  bucket with scalding water from his fountain, which bringing out, and ascending  a few ratlines of the rigging, he poured carefully over the whale&rsquo;s back. It  was all done so quickly that it was too late to do anything but anxiously watch  the effect.</p>
<p>The  rubbing and grunting abruptly ceased, a cataract of water deluged us, and with  a shake and twist of his flukes, which made the cutter rock and quiver so  violently as to throw us all flat on the deck, our visitor disappeared. Nor did  we see anything more of him for about half an hour, when he was discovered  spouting away about two miles astern.</p>
<p>I  have not the slightest notion whether the hot water really was the cause of his  departure, or whether he meant going in any case. Be that as it may, the cook  got the full benefit of the doubt, and was as proud a man that day as if he had  captured a whole school of whales single-handed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  Gosh!&rdquo; exclaimed the skipper, as he squinted through the glass at our now  distant visitor, &ldquo;I thought, sure, once or twice, we was for turning turtle all  out. Here, doctor&rdquo; (to the cook), &ldquo;come down below an&rsquo; get a stiffener. It was  a scary kind o&rsquo; thing to try&mdash;tannin&rsquo; his hide with bilin&rsquo; water; but, as luck  would have, it turned up trumps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  made a good run from Cape Naturaliste to just abreast of Fremantle, when it  suddenly came on to blow pretty stiffly from the eastward, causing us to stand  out to sea again for the night.</p>
<p>Early  the next morning we saw a barque coming straight out of the port. Blowing hard  though it was, she was under her royals and topgallant-staysails. As she passed  us like a shot, at a distance of only a couple of hundred yards or so, she kept  away a point, and set her gaff-topsail and flying-gib, whilst we could see a  crowd of men busily rigging up preventer-stays and back-stays&mdash;not before it was  time, either, for it was a miracle how her masts stood.</p>
<p>From  her gaff-end the American colours blew out like a painted board; and on the  poop, clustered about the weather mizzen-rigging, was a little group of people  who waved their pocket-handkerchiefs to us, whilst the sound of cheering came  faintly up against the wind, as she swiftly darted by, becoming in a few  minutes a far-away patch of white between the sombre sea and sky.
<p>&ldquo;An  outward-bounder,&rdquo; remarked my captain; &ldquo;an&rsquo; the passengers ain&rsquo;t quite over  their first spree yet.&rdquo; Shortly afterwards, a small steamer passed us,  apparently in hot pursuit of the barque, now nearly a mile down to the  westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone  lost their passage, an&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; to pull it up agen,&rdquo; said the skipper. &ldquo;Gov&rsquo;ment,  too,&rdquo; added the old fellow, as he pointed to the Union Jack flying at the  steamer&rsquo;s masthead. &ldquo;My eye!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;how them Yanks do crack on, to be  sure! It&rsquo;s odds that them that&rsquo;s lost their passages &rsquo;ll have to wait for the  next boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  my old man was wrong; a passage had not been lost, but won.</p>
<p>We  were gazing, although we knew it not at the time, on one of the scenes (an  escape which has become matter of history) in a great drama, which, begun of  old in the land of the Shamrock, has, little by little, assumed proportions as  tremendous and threatening as those of any tragedy yet placed upon the stage  where nations are the actors; a drama the players in which, though scattered  the whole world over, are ever performing with more or less of skill, and  intention, good or evil, before their countrymen in that most unhappy Erin&mdash;a  land they would fain have their audience believe&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Where  bastard Freedom waves<br>
Her fustian flag in mockery over slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Later  on, the Government steamer passed us again on her return from what had proved a  bootless errand. She had, it was true, caught up with the fugitives, who had  shortened sail, once out of Australian waters, and allowed her to come  alongside. Then the captain had pointed to the Flag above his head and dared  the officers of justice to seize their prisoners upon what was now virtually  American ground.</p>
<p>And  so it ended. But I often think of that little group on the deck of the barque,  cheering with light hearts on that wild and stormy morning, as, surging over  the ocean, in all the glory of a newly-acquired freedom, under the protecting  aegis of the starry banner of the Great   Republic, they bade  Imperial captivity farewell. Some are dead since then; some survive, perhaps  yet to make history.</p>
<p>That  evening we picked up our pilot, an imposing and portly uniformed personage, who  looked as much out of place on our homely deck as a post-captain would have  done on a hay barge, but who, nevertheless, took us safely to our anchorage.</p>
<p>And  now, for the time, at anyrate, I must end this portion of our cruise. But at  some future day I may perhaps tell my readers how we took the little <i>Ruby</i> to the pearling grounds, then to  Singapore, and up and down the Eastern seas, where, land being always in sight,  the good old skipper&mdash;contrary to the general rule in such cases&mdash;had plenty of  leisure for his favourite studies; and how, too, after an absence of nearly two  years &mdash; years full of adventure and incident&mdash;we at last managed to find our way  back to Australia, little the better in pocket, perhaps, but in experience  much.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ChristmasSeagiven"></a>Christmas  Seagiven</b></h2>
<p>He  was a neighbour of mine, the old sea-captain. He said he didn&rsquo;t think of going  afloat any more. Why should he&mdash;a bachelor comfortably to do, and with the best  housekeeper in Bow to look after him?</p>
<p>Imagine  my surprise, then, when one evening, hailing me over the privet hedge which  divided our little gardens, he said in an excited yet half-shamefaced sort of a  way that he had made up his mind for another trip&mdash; had even now &ldquo;got a ship,&rdquo;  and was to start almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deep-water,  I&rsquo;m thankful to say. The East Indies and China. A fine clipper barque. I  never asked for her. They just let me know&mdash; the old firm&mdash; that if I was minded  to sight blue water again they could accommodate me. I&rsquo;m not an aged man yet.  Only fifty, though my hair is so grey. Do you good to come, too, instead of  sitting in that office all day long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  was, at that time, a shipping clerk at one of the new &ldquo;Homes&rdquo; for seamen in London. Sure enough a few  days after this up come the captain and his men to sign articles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name  in full, Captain Dunlop, please,&rdquo; I said, seeing that he had written his  initials only before the surname, getting another form ready as I spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas  Seagiven,&rdquo; replied he promptly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Born  at sea on a Christmas morn?&rdquo; I remarked, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; answered he very gravely. &ldquo;Come in to-night and I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  have a vivid memory of that long-ago evening at Bow, haven of retired merchant  skippers, in the snug little cottage; of the curio-laden walls, the great  half-model on the mantelshelf, the cheerful firelight glancing from the  polished copper kettle on to the case-bottles and tumblers on the table, and  illumining the hale and handsome features of the old sea captain as he bent  forward, tongs in hand, to pick the needful coal for his pipe.</p>
<p>I  remember, too, as I sat and waited, wondering at the magic power of that sea  which could draw a man of his age out of such comfortable quarters.</p>
<p>I  tell his own story in my own words.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  good ship <i>Perseus</i> had just left the  south-east Trades. She had lost her headway at the same time, and was simply  wallowing around at random with an awful slapping of clewed-up sails and gear,  and tin dishes in the galley.</p>
<p>It  was in the second dog-watch, quite light as yet, and both watches were lying  about for&rsquo;ard waiting until eight bells and &ldquo;Grog ho!&rdquo;&mdash;for the <i>Perseus</i> was a good ship, grog every  night; butter, &ldquo;plums&rdquo; and currants, vinegar and mustard; plenty, but no waste.</p>
<p>Aft  stood the captain and the mate, now looking up anxiously at the darkening blue  of the sky, now over the side at the oily gurgling pools which circled and  eddied in the swell left by the lost wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  much use boxhauling the yards about, Mr. James,&rdquo; said the captain at length.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a regular Irishman&rsquo;s hurricane at present&mdash;fair up and down. However, we  mustn&rsquo;t growl. The sou&rsquo;-easters served us handsomely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight  bells, sir,&rdquo; sang out an apprentice from the other side of the poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make  it,&rdquo; replied the mate.</p>
<p>As  the boy walked towards the bell a sudden confused hubbub and bustle for&rsquo;ard  caused him to halt. Exclamations, oaths, and then a patter of bare feet on  wood, as the ship&rsquo;s company came rushing aft in a body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  up now?&rdquo; sang out the captain, as he saw all hands invade the sanctity of the  quarter-deck, gallop furiously up the ladders, and swarm on to the poop itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; echoed Mr. James, catching hold of one of the fellows as they  pressed on towards the taffrail. &ldquo;Have you seen the devil for&rsquo;ard there? Or is  the ship on fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, who appeared half crazed with terror. &ldquo;There he  comes now,&rdquo; pointing to a tall white object, just visible in the dusk,  advancing slowly along the main-deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it, Mr. James?&rdquo; asked the skipper, peering for&rsquo;ard, but also backing aft  along with the mate.</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;And for bonnie Annie Laurie<br>
I&rsquo;d lay me doun an&rsquo; dee,&rdquo;</p>
<p>quavered  shrilly up into the calm night air from the figure, which had paused  irresolutely just in front of the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  stowaway!&rdquo; exclaimed the skipper, with a sigh of relief, but omitting to  mention his authority. &ldquo;The devil don&rsquo;t sing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; put in one of the men, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s no stowaway. He come over the bows right  into the middle of us on the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle head.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Like dew on the gowan lying<br>
Is the fa&rsquo; o&rsquo; her fairy feet,&rdquo;</p>
<p>shrilled  that unearthly voice once more, as the second mate, coming out of his berth,  found himself face to face with its owner.</p>
<p>He  was a surly old North Country man, this  officer, and demanded he&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  game&rsquo;s this? Are ye goin&rsquo; daft, wi&rsquo; yer screechin&rsquo; on the quarter-deck, an&rsquo; wi&rsquo;out  yer claes? Eight bells isna gone yet. Which of ye is&rsquo;t, anyway? I&rsquo;ll get yer  grog stopped, my man, for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus  speaking, he came closer, peering, and then, with a scared oath, retreated  slowly up the poop-ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is it, Mr. Munro?&rdquo; inquired the captain, walking for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nane  o&rsquo; ours, sir,&rdquo; replied the second. &ldquo;It give me a bit turn, the creature&rsquo;s face.  It&rsquo;s flesh an&rsquo; bluid, though, I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said the other, who had got over his first fright, &ldquo;bring one of the  binnacle lamps along and let&rsquo;s explore the mystery.&rdquo; Followed by the two mates  and a long string of others, the skipper walked straight up to the figure, now  leaning against the quarter-deck capstan. A man certainly. A living skeleton, quite  naked but for the remnants of a pair of trousers, with the light of madness in  its sunken shining eyes. A long fair beard fell down on to the bare chest, and,  with hair of the same colour all tangled and matted, sparkled saltly in the  lamp rays.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run  for&rsquo;ard, some of you,&rdquo; said the skipper after a pause, &ldquo;and see if there&rsquo;s a  boat or a raft hanging about the ship anywhere. Mr. James, will you call the  doctor?&mdash;if he&rsquo;s sober.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then,  with kind words and gestures, they strove to lead the unfortunate creature into  the saloon, whose cheerful lights shone along the deck. But resisting every  entreaty, he clung to the capstan and fondled it, and called it endearing  names, and would not be parted from it except by force.</p>
<p>It  was a painful, ay, a terrible, sight, and the rough seamen around&mdash;their  superstitious fears calmed by the present discovery, made fast to a rope&rsquo;s end  which had been towing overboard, of a couple of hencoops roughly lashed  together &mdash;felt awed and moved at this eloquent reminder from the great ocean of  what might be their own fate at any minute.</p>
<p>The <i>Perseus</i> carried one passenger, a  doctor, experienced and skilful, but given to periodical &ldquo;drunks.&rdquo; Luckily, he  had recovered from his last one sufficiently to be of use; and under his  directions they at last succeeded in getting the castaway into one of the spare  berths, where, after administering some broth, the doctor had the satisfaction  of seeing him fall into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  wonder the men were scared, Mr. James,&rdquo; remarked the captain, as he looked at  the hencoops tied feebly together with strips of clothing. &ldquo;I felt that way  myself for a while. But, good God! what must the poor devil have suffered? Will  he ever regain his senses, d&rsquo;ye think, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  you when he wakes,&rdquo; replied the latter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a most interesting case. Man&rsquo;s  been for a fortnight without food. He&rsquo;s weaker, physically, than a new-born  baby. And yet you saw how the mind&rsquo;s distemper raging within gave him strength.  The chances are that if he does recover his memory &rsquo;ll be a mere <i>tabula rasa</i>&mdash;a blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  forbid!&rdquo; exclaimed the captain fervently.</p>
<p>A  week passed before the <i>Perseus</i> again  caught a dependable wind. All that time the stranger lay and babbled wildly of  many things, but mainly of &ldquo;Annie&rdquo; and of &ldquo;Dot.&rdquo; The doctor, taking an interest  in his patient, and forswearing grog, watched him and tended him skilfully and  incessantly until he took a turn for the better. And one breezy sunny morning,  the fluted cliffs of Tristan d&rsquo;Acunha bearing broad on the port bow, and the <i>Perseus</i> surging along with a sparkling  wake of crisp white and tender blue, in which Cape pigeons, gulls, and  mollyauks screamed and dipped and scrambled, the convalescent, weak and wan,  and faltering of speech, but &ldquo;clothed and in his right mind,&rdquo; was carried on  deck.</p>
<p>But  ere this, bit by bit, his story had been learned. His name was Dunlop, and he  was a civil engineer going out to take charge of some extensive irrigation  works in Victoria.  With his wife and their only child, a boy of three years, they had taken  passage in a vessel called the <i>Western  Empire</i>, a fine fast sailer, nearly new, and only on her second voyage to Melbourne.</p>
<p>One  evening, a fresh breeze blowing, while Dunlop was sitting smoking on the broad  rail at the gangway, one hand holding by a line of the running-gear, suddenly  he felt something give aloft, down came the rope, and, losing his balance, he  fell overboard. He had time only for a single cry, but as he rose astern he could  hear the hoarse shouts of &ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo; could see the black loom of the ship  hove up in the wind with a letting go of sheets and halliards and a flapping  and banging of canvas; then, between towering walls of water hurrying along,  each doing its best to overwhelm him, he got bewildered, and no longer knew in  which direction to look for her. He was a splendid swimmer, but the sea was too  high for him, so desisting from the struggle he contented himself with keeping  afloat and waiting for the boat that he thought must surely come. At this  moment he found the first hencoop. Getting astride it, he listened with  agonised intensity for the splash of oars or calls of rescue, shouting himself  at intervals. The darkness gathered more thickly about him. His voice, the only  thing audible save the angry hiss of the waves as they swept over him, sounded  hollow and unnatural in his ears.</p>
<p>All  through the long watches of the night he clung to his frail support, and  strained his eyesight, and shouted until he could shout no longer. Fortunately  both air and water were warm, or he must have perished.</p>
<p>As  the dawn broke and the sun rose, lighting up the vast sailless waste of watery  furrows, he realised to the full what pretty nearly everybody knows nowadays &mdash;  that he who falls overboard from a merchant vessel is nothing better than a  dead man. There may be just one chance out of a thousand in a calm and by broad  daylight; in the night, unless God work a miracle, as in his case, none  whatever. Whether they lowered a boat or not he was unable to say. Probably  they did, and after pulling aimlessly about for half an hour, gave it up;  whilst, as the &ldquo;official log,&rdquo; has it, &ldquo;the ship proceeded on her course.&rdquo; For  which quotation, and an addendum to the effect that the incident &ldquo;cast a gloom  over the remainder of the passage, the missing man being a general favourite,&rdquo;  see almost any newspaper&rsquo;s reports of the incoming shipping. Later on he picked  up another hencoop, and formed the frail raft we have described.</p>
<p>God  was very good to him. Once he caught an albatross asleep, and, after a fierce  battle with the great bird, the scars of which were yet scarce healed, he  killed it.</p>
<p>Think  of the struggle in mid-ocean between the naked perishing man and his  iron-beaked adversary, of the wild screaming of the thing, and the rushing of  its huge pinions as it beat and clutched and tore at its captor!</p>
<p>During  part of his awful experience frequent showers fell, so that he suffered little  from thirst.</p>
<p>How  long he had been floating about, half dead, half mad, wholly hopeless, when the  shock of his raft against the bows of the <i>Perseus</i> aroused him from a sort of trance, he had not the remotest idea&mdash;certainly more  than a week.</p>
<p>As  time went on he improved rapidly, developing from a skeleton into a man of  magnificent physique and almost herculean strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  said the doctor one day, eyeing him. &ldquo;Another dose like that wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you  now&mdash;with me to pull you through at the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  was a man, too, of culture and trained intelligence, whose opinion on many  subjects was in itself a liberal education to listen to.</p>
<p>Thus  the little group in the cabin became much attached to their rescued passenger.  Even the crusty old second mate went so far as to remark, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a mon, ivery  inch o&rsquo; him, though he did coom aboord on us like the divil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But,  in head winds, or calms, it was pitiful to see him. He roamed the ship like a  caged animal, watching the water, watching the sky, with a passionate, eager  look in his eyes that told its tale to everyone. Then, when with a couple of  white hillocks pouring away from each side of her fore-foot the <i>Perseus</i> laid her course, his post was  aloft, scanning the horizon in search of the ship that held those who were so  dear to him.</p>
<p>The <i>Perseus</i> being bound to Sydney, the two vessels  were probably running along much the same parallels, although the captain&rsquo;s  opinion was that the <i>Empire</i> had kept  more to the south, and that their chances of sighting her were extremely  slight. Besides, he knew her, and knew that she was the faster vessel of the  two.</p>
<p>But  Dunlop never relaxed his vigilance&mdash; always the pale, expectant face set  steadily eastward.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>On  Christmas Day, and when half-way across the Southern Ocean, it came on to blow  heavily, with signs of more, and the <i>Perseus</i>,  under her three topsails and foresails, roared along like a steamer. &ldquo;Off  again, Mr. Dunlop,&rdquo; said the skipper as, coming on deck, he espied the former  with his glass slung over his shoulder ready to ascend the weather  mizzen-rigging. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s of no use, though,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;the <i>Empire</i> got too great a start for us. I  suppose it&rsquo;s not much use wishing you a &lsquo;Merry Christmas&rsquo; whilst the wife and  the youngster are away. But let me hope that before the New Year&rsquo;s far gone you&rsquo;ll  be together again. A fortnight of this, and the old Leeuwin &rsquo;ll be astern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you, captain,&rdquo; replied the other, as he stood on the shear-pole. &ldquo;Yes, please  God, I shall see Annie and the boy before very long. They will thank you  themselves then, captain I can&rsquo;t do it nearly enough without their help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!  nonsense, man!&rdquo; growled the skipper, as he squinted aloft &ldquo;Mind, now, and keep  a good hold up there, unless you&rsquo;re hankering after another trip on a coop. I  can&rsquo;t venture a boat in this sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  look out this time,&rdquo; answered Dunlop, as he sprang up the rigging on to the top-gallant-yard,  where, seated with one arm around the tie, he worked away with his binocular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  usual, I suppose?&rdquo; queried the captain at luncheon-time. &ldquo;Nothing in sight? I  never remember, in all the runs I&rsquo;ve made across here, falling in with so few  ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  fancy I saw something right ahead,&rdquo; replied Dunlop. &ldquo;But a squall came along  and hid it. Anyhow, it wasn&rsquo;t a ship, or at least not one with her sails set.  It seemed merely a black spot under the grey sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might  be a derelict, though,&rdquo; remarked the captain. &ldquo;Send a man aloft, if you please,  Mr. James, and tell him to keep his eyes skinned. Deuced ugly thing a derelict  pottering about right in our track, I can tell you, Mr. Dunlop. Might just as  well run slap into a rock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before  the meal was quite over the second mate put his head down the companion with,  &ldquo;Theer&rsquo;s something &rsquo;bout a point on the lee bow, sir. Looks to me like a ship  with the sticks outen her. Ye can see her off the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle-head now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  a minute the others were on deck. Sure enough, there was the object Dunlop had  first discovered, little more, as yet, to the untrained eye, than the dark spot  it had appeared to him, but rising fast as the <i>Perseus</i> drew nearer. Now the mate jumped aloft with his glass, and  presently came from him&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a big ship dismasted and nearly awash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Closer  and closer drove the <i>Perseus</i>, keeping  a weather helm, and with every glass in her focussed on the wreck, over the  greater part of which big seas were arching in glassy deluges.</p>
<p>Mr.  James had come down and joined the watchers on the poop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  heavens!&rdquo; he suddenly exclaimed, as a watery sun-glint shot out of the ragged,  lowering storm-clouds, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s people on her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As,  still keeping her helm up, the <i>Perseus</i> approached with foresail clewed up, topsails on the caps, and reef-tackles  hauled out, a pitiful spectacle presented itself.</p>
<p>Over  the hull of a large ship, her decks nearly level with the water, the sea was  making clean breaches. About eight feet of each mast was left standing, and the  wreckage, with a confused raffle of ropes and rigging, rose and fell and dashed  on board as each sea broke over her. Aft and amidships was nothing but an  incessant curling up and falling in sheets of foam of heavy combers.</p>
<p>The  topgallant-fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle alone formed a little island of refuge which, though swept  at intervals by showers of spume and spindrift, had as yet escaped the  thunderous masses that roared across the rest of the vessel. From the stump of  the shattered bowsprit a hawser had been carried round the remnant of the  foremast and back again. To the part of this extending along the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle-deck,  some thirty feet perhaps, five men and a woman were fastened. The latter&rsquo;s long  black hair streamed with the wind off her shoulders, whilst clasped in both  arms to her breast she held a bundle. Possibly the poor wretches shouted. But  if they did, the relentless gale blew the words back down their throats. There  was no mistaking, though, the eloquent dumb appeal of waving beckoning arms and  hands; and once the woman lifted the bundle from her bosom and opening it  showed a child. It was a sight agonising in the hopelessness and the misery of  it.</p>
<p>At  this moment a voice as of a mortally stricken man, so full of anguish was it,  sounded in the captain&rsquo;s ear, making him start as if bitten by a snake. &ldquo;My  God!&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;my God! It&rsquo;s Annie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning,  he saw Dunlop, white as death, and shaking in every limb as he pointed with  extended finger towards the wreck. He said no more, but stood motionless,  staring fixedly at the huddled-up figures through whose bodies the hawser  seemed to run as if they were strung on it, whilst every now and then, the seas  rising higher, a green one would break over their refuge and sweep them all  swinging off their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind,&rdquo; said the skipper, after a pause, and in a voice he in vain tried to  render confident, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take it to heart so. We&rsquo;ll hang about until this bit  of a blow&rsquo;s over, and then we&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em off all right. It&rsquo;s sudden death to  lower a boat now &rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the other replied only by a groan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run  up the ensign, Mr. James,&rdquo; shouted the skipper, &ldquo;and let those poor folk see  that they&rsquo;ve got Englishmen to deal with! God knows it makes my heart ache to  know we can&rsquo;t give &rsquo;em better comfort than that. But I must think of my own men&rsquo;s  lives first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call  the hands,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and let them stow the foresail and mizzen-tops&rsquo;l,  and close reef the fore and main ones. Tell &rsquo;em to stand by to heave the ship  to. I&rsquo;ll stick by &rsquo;em as long as a plank of her holds together. And, by heaven!  if all the Royal Navy was here in such-like weather they couldn&rsquo;t do more! A  falling glass, too!&rdquo; he muttered to himself. &ldquo;And only this morning, Christmas  morning, I was promising him he should soon see &rsquo;em! God help us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little  need was there to &ldquo;call all hands&rdquo; A great thrill of sympathy and pity had run  through the <i>Perseus</i> and brought her  men crowding aft, eager to hear their captain&rsquo;s determination. A ringing cheer  escaped them as the mate repeated his orders, and they sprang aloft like cats.  Had the skipper called for volunteers to man a boat he could have had them  twice over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  Billy,&rdquo; said an old sailor to a young messmate who indignantly demanded of him  why that step was not taken at once, &ldquo;so the skipper would; only, ye see, he  knows his business, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;re just a-beginnin&rsquo; to larn it. But I&rsquo;ll tell ye.  Fust an&rsquo; foremost, no boat, &rsquo;cept a lifeboat, &rsquo;d live in the sea as&rsquo;ll be on in  another half-hour. Second, if she got to the hull over yonder she&rsquo;d never get  no closer&rsquo;n a hundred yards of her, an&rsquo; a precious lot o&rsquo; good &rsquo;d be done then.  Thirdly, Billy, afore we&rsquo;d got clear o&rsquo; the <i>Pershoos</i> we&rsquo;d be all a-floatin&rsquo; bung up an&rsquo; bilge free among them combers, as that last  one, ye&rsquo;ll notice, precious nigh took the galley away wi&rsquo; it. Not but,&rdquo; he  concluded sententiously, getting a grip of the bunt of the foresail with his  horny old fingers&mdash;&ldquo;not but what I&rsquo;d go, Billy, if I was axed&rdquo;
<p>The <i>Perseus</i> was now crossing the wreck&rsquo;s  bows perilously close, her yards covered with men getting in the canvas  preparatory to bringing the ship to. The captain, standing at the break of the  poop, his attention taken up with the work, had forgotten his unfortunate  passenger, when a loud shout from the man at the wheel caused him to run aft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  gone, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed the fellow excitedly, pointing to a heap of clothes on  the deck. &ldquo;He went all on a suddent. Shoves a bowline in one o&rsquo; them there  royal sheets, then into it, an&rsquo; dives off afore I seen what he was up to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  glance at the slowly paying-out line, another to where, on the summit of a  white-crested billow, floated something whiter still, and the captain  understood. A few more minutes, and the <i>Perseus</i>,  head to wind, lay like a duck amongst the big seas, only taking in one now and  again&mdash;making, in fact, what seamen call &ldquo;good weather&rdquo; of it.</p>
<p>In  the morning, before the wreck was sighted, the watch had been busy unreeving  the mizzen-royal sheets and reeving new ones. The old ones neatly coiled up  still lay on the poop. An end of one of these Dunlop had secured around him  before taking his mad leap into the boiling sea.</p>
<p>A  couple of men attended to the line, which paid slowly, so slowly, out, as the  desperate swimmer battled with the seething waves, half the time hidden from  sight in the roaring chasms, his position only defined by a swooping flock of  gulls and a single albatross, which latter, on extended wings, hovered just  above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pull  him in!&rdquo; exclaimed the mate presently. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sin to see a life thrown away  like this. Mortal man can never fight such a sea. Why, the weight of the rope  he&rsquo;s towing is enough to sink a horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave  him alone!&rdquo; commanded the captain. &ldquo;I tell you at the very first tightening of  that line he&rsquo;d throw it off altogether. Some purpose he had in his mind when he  took it. Not for himself, I&rsquo;m sure. Bend on the other sheet and get up a coil  or two of that small running-gear we unrove yesterday, and fake it out along  the deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  right, captain,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;I know him. If mortal man can do it, he&rsquo;s  the one. Never bother yourself about the weight of the rope, Mr. James. He  doesn&rsquo;t feel it any more than you or I would a piece of twine. It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m  afraid of. It&rsquo;s the bitter foam and spray in his mouth and his eyes and his  ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picture  to yourself, if you can, the scene. Under the lowering sky a leaden,  white-tipped sea off whose lofty surges the furious wind blew the foam like  smoke; then the wreck, at moments invisible under a smother of spray as wave  after wave crashed over it; to leeward the <i>Perseus</i>,  looking gaunt and bare under her two rags of canvas, the gale shrilling wildly  through her rigging, now riding high on top of a big billow, now hidden to her  mastheads between a couple, her ensign drooping motionless in the sudden calm,  then streaming bravely out again, a patch of red against the dark background of  sky, as, rising, the vessel felt the wind; the group on her poop, with their  gaze travelling from the wondrous swimmer to the line dragging out ever more  slowly, making the watching of it like viewing the lingering agonies of a dying  man.</p>
<p>The  afternoon wore on. More than once they thought it was all over, and were  preparing to haul in the lifeless body, when someone would catch a glimpse of  the struggling form still heading for its goal. A longer interval than usual  had elapsed since sighting the swimmer when, through a rift in the sullen sky,  a sudden shaft of sunlight shot down full on the wreck. At the same time, too,  came one of those pauses common enough in the heaviest gales. A man shouted and  pointed. A cheer that was half a groan rang out as a white figure was seen to  drag itself slowly and painfully along the hawser towards the woman, never  pausing at any of the others, three of whom now, in the new light, it could be  noticed, hung limply doubled over the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!  he&rsquo;s a-cuddlin&rsquo; of her, an&rsquo; kissin&rsquo; of her an&rsquo; the kid!&rdquo; exclaimed one of the  men. And his mates pulled their sou&rsquo;-westers farther over their foreheads and  swore passionately for the very pity of the thing.</p>
<p>How  he got through the terrible sea bursts, the sweeping raffle of rigging, and the  deadly barricade of broken spars will never be known. The love that filled the  great heart of him did it, and carried him scatheless through the valley of the  shadow, through the &ldquo;many waters&rdquo; that &ldquo;cannot quench love,&rdquo; to die beside his  wife, the mother of his child.</p>
<p>With  breathless interest they watched what followed. They saw Dunlop take the skirt  off his wife&rsquo;s dress, she helping him, and wrap it around the boy. Then,  holding the child in his arms, he made the end of the rope he had brought with  him fast about its body, and when all was ready held it towards those on the <i>Perseus</i> with much the same appealing  gesture as his wife had done before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  out there at the line!&rdquo; almost screamed the mate; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s going to throw the  child clear of everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly  Dunlop and his burden disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand  by!&rdquo; sang out the captain; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s only gone to give it a fair start; watch the  woman!&rdquo; And, sure enough, in a minute or two she waved her arms towards the <i>Perseus</i>, and &ldquo;Pull!&rdquo; yelled the skipper,  and they pulled like furies, whilst Dunlop crept back to the side of his wife.  The lull was over now, and the wind raged and the sea ran as wildly as ever. It  seemed hours before a little white something, tossed from comber to comber like  a bird&rsquo;s feather, came in sight. No one thought of the wreck now. Every eye was  fixed on the second mate, who, with a bowline around him, stood in the  mizzen-rigging, and into whose arms presently, as the ship descended between  two sloping hills of water, a curving billow nearly dashed the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead,  of course! What else d&rsquo;ye expect?&rdquo; said the doctor, as he looked down on the  body&mdash;stripped perfectly naked by the sea, and with a red-raw rope-chafe under  its arms on the delicate white skin. &ldquo;It was only madness to attempt such a  thing. The life must have been beaten out of it in the first minute.&rdquo; But even  whilst speaking he caught it up and ran away with it to his own berth, followed  by half a dozen volunteers bearing the hot water he had called for. Taking the  water, and locking the others out, he went to work, not appearing again on deck  until evening. Then the first look at his face was enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God!&rdquo; cried the captain, grasping his hand, which he shook heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  he&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; answered the doctor, hastily withdrawing his fingers and shaking  them. &ldquo;A narrow squeak, though! But he&rsquo;s not got his father&rsquo;s constitution for  nothing. As fine a three-year-old as ever you saw. Wreck broken up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  wreck had not broken up. But the <i>Perseus</i> had increased her distance so much as to render glasses necessary to discern at  one end of the hawser Dunlop and his wife, apparently clasped in each other&rsquo;s  arms, then the three limp bundles hanging over it. The other places were  vacant. The boy (as he told afterwards) remembered his father imploring those  yet sensible in turns to let him fasten one of them on the line with him. But  they refused. They were apathetic and resigned. They would sooner die where  they were than have the breath crushed out of them in that roaring caldron.  Better so, probably. The extra weight would have snapped the rope or drowned  both.</p>
<p>There  were a couple of 12-pounder guns aboard the <i>Perseus</i>.  The captain ordered them to be loaded as quickly as possible. It was still  daylight when, as the ship rode on the top of a big sea, he gave the signal to  fire, and as the reports echoed sullenly over the water, himself dipped the  ensign three times. It was at once the requiem of those &ldquo;faithful unto death&rdquo;  and the salute to the rescued. &ldquo;If I could but think that they&rsquo;ll take it as a  sign the child&rsquo;s safe,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d feel more satisfied. I believe  those two can die happy, knowing so much. Heaven help them! It&rsquo;s going to be a  terrible night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Already  he had done more than many a shipmaster would have dreamt of doing. But still  throughout the long night he kept the <i>Perseus</i> hove to, with lights hanging fore and aft her.</p>
<p>Next  morning the wreck was gone&mdash;not a vestige left&mdash;and the child was crying for its  mother. All the name they knew him by was his pet one of &ldquo;Dot.&rdquo; It was the only  one he recognised himself. Therefore the captain, who, finding that he had no  other relatives, eventually adopted him, had him rechristened &ldquo;Christmas  Seagiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="ADerelict"></a>A Derelict</b></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Take  the glass, Mr. Staunton, your eyes are younger than mine, and tell me what you  make of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  speaker was the master of the British ship <i>Minnehaha</i>,  just thirty days out from London to Algoa Bay,  and at that moment lying becalmed about two degrees south of the Equator, with  a great deal more easting in her longitude than she had any business with.  Indeed, we should not have been very much surprised, owing to the set of a  current the ship had got into, and the incessant calms experienced of late, to  sight the African coast at any minute. Taking the telescope from the captain&rsquo;s  hand, and resting it on the ratlines of the mizzen rigging, I had a long look  at the distant object, which had since daybreak been exciting our curiosity.</p>
<p>That  it was a ship of some kind or other, and a big one, there was no doubt; and  presently, as she floated into the field of the glass, I could see that, whilst  she appeared very high out of the water, she had nothing standing aloft above  her topmasts, and, as far as I could make out, no sail of any kind set, nor any  signals flying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  remarked the captain, &ldquo;a derelict, I expect, and one, in this part of the sea  into which our singular bad fortune has brought us, of no recent making. If you  don&rsquo;t mind losing your watch below you can take two or three hands in the  quarter-boat, or perhaps the gig will be lighter, and board her. It&rsquo;s just  possible there may be some poor wretch on her still. We shall, worse luck, be  drifting closer to you all the time. I shouldn&rsquo;t be much astonished to find  ourselves at anchor off some infernal swamp, with the ship full of fever and  mosquitoes, if this kind of thing lasts much longer,&rdquo; and so saying, the  skipper went below, with a sigh of weariness, and a-glance around at the  monotonous scene, familiar for so long, the bleaching decks and spars, the  drooping, listless canvas, with everywhere the deadly sameness of oily-looking,  greenish-blue water.</p>
<p>I  was the second mate of the <i>Minnehaha</i>,  and the hard routine of my profession had not as yet in those days wholly  knocked the romance out of me, so that it was with not a little feeling of  eager anticipation for the adventure that I waited for the bell to strike  eight, and my relief to turn out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair  and easy, my boy,&rdquo; said the first officer as he, at length, stood yawning by my  side after having taken a long squint at the stranger; &ldquo;take my advice, and  have breakfast before you start. It&rsquo;s a long pull, and the sun will be out  strong by the time you&rsquo;re halfway. I&rsquo;m of the old man&rsquo;s opinion that she&rsquo;s been  knocking about for some time, months perhaps. A foreigner, I should imagine, by  the cut of her, and likely enough, grass on her decks a foot long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After  breakfast, myself, the boatswain, and two of the able seamen&mdash;the latter, in  spite of the long pull before them, as happy as schoolboys at the prospect of a  holiday and a change from the weary ship&mdash;set off on our visit to the derelict.</p>
<p>It  was now about nine o&rsquo;clock, and before we had gone one mile out of the four  that we had judged the distance at, the men&rsquo;s clothes were wet through with  perspiration.</p>
<p>I  had brought a small beaker of water, two bottles of ship&rsquo;s rum, and some  eatables with us; so, after a good draught of six-water grog all round, the  boatswain and myself gave the two seamen a spell at the oars; and soon the  mysterious ocean wanderer loomed up large ahead of us. As we drew nearer we saw  that she was a ship of fully 1400 tons, nearly twice the size of our own little  clipper, and that she had originally been painted white with a yellow streak.</p>
<p>At  last we were alongside, and, as the men ceased rowing, we all gazed with  something of awe up at the desolate, forsaken thing. She was an immense height  out of the water, and her sides&mdash; weatherbeaten, blistered, for the most part  bare of paint, and with long streaks of iron rust straggling down them&mdash; towered  above us, grim, forbidding, and uncanny.</p>
<p>As  we slowly paddled round her we saw that in one place the sea had made a clean  breach through her bulwarks on either side. Strips of her topsails and courses  were still hanging from the yards, and, as we came athwart her bows, the  rotting bolt-ropes of some of her head-sails swung to and fro under the  bowsprit with every little lurch she gave. Aft we noticed the davit-falls and  tackles, all fagged out and minus the lower blocks, drooping down just as they  had been left when the boats deserted her to let her wander about the ocean,  the sport and plaything of every little breeze that blew. It was indeed a  melancholy sight, and to a sailor more especially, of all men!</p>
<p>No  name was on her stern, only the broad, blank, yellow streak continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think, sir,&rdquo; remarked the boatswain, a fine old seaman named Dyson, &ldquo;that she&rsquo;s  a Portu-gee or somethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind, an&rsquo; she may have been desarted for years  by the look on her. My eye, she&rsquo;s light an&rsquo; no mistake! In ballast, I s&rsquo;pose.  No name ahead or astern, either,&rdquo; continued he, glancing suspiciously up at the  old-fashioned quarter-galleries, which gave her such a cumbrous look aft &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  like her nohow, an&rsquo; I don&rsquo;t care how soon we all gets aboard the little <i>Minnie</i> agen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  come, Dyson,&rdquo; said I laughingly, &ldquo;it would never do for us to go back without  overhauling her. We&rsquo;ll have a snack here in the boat and then we&rsquo;ll take a look  aboard this big castaway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  were by this time again under the bows, and one of the sailors putting up his  boathook and dragging away a portion of the canvas which hung down, disclosed  to view the derelict&rsquo;s figurehead, a piece of magnificent carving, representing  a woman in three-quarter length, clad in flowing classical drapery, and whose  features seemed to look down upon us with an expression of solemn sadness,  whilst one arm, slightly raised, pointed to the dark sky overhead. It was a  masterpiece of the sculptor&rsquo;s art, such as I had never dreamed of seeing placed  on the bows of a ship, and was doubtless meant for the Madonna&mdash;Mary of the Sea,  perhaps, for,</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;By many names men call her,<br>
In many homes she dwells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And,  strangely enough, the paint, so worn and abraded everywhere else, still showed  on the figure above us in almost all its pristine whiteness. Perhaps the  overhanging canvas had protected it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  Lord!&rdquo; ejaculated the old boatswain presently, as we all stared at the nobly  gracious, but sorrowful features. &ldquo;Did ever mortal man see such a figgerhead as  that! I never did; and forty year an&rsquo; more I&rsquo;ve been a-roamin&rsquo; about amongst  every sort o&rsquo; craft as sails. I almost begins to believe, sir, as this old  derelick&rsquo;s been a sort o&rsquo; floatin&rsquo; gospel-house &mdash;that is,&rdquo; he quickly qualified,  &ldquo;so long as I looks at that bit o&rsquo; work there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently  many a great sea, tall as she was, had swept her fore and aft, without,  however, doing much damage beyond making the two rents in her thick bulwarks  mentioned above. The hatchways were closely battened down, and the main one,  which we could see had been fitted with gratings, was now secured with inch  planks fastened to the deck by stout iron bolts.</p>
<p>All  about the decks, in the scuppers everywhere, in confused bunches, lay the  running rigging, just as the seas of the last gale she had encountered had  washed it; but of the wreck of the missing spars there was no sign.</p>
<p>The  deck planking was covered thickly with a kind of dry, mossy substance that  crackled beneath our tread, showing that, at one time, the vessel&rsquo;s decks had  been, perhaps, for weeks under water.</p>
<p>I had  just shut down the lid of the signal-locker, in which I had been vainly  searching amongst a bundle of mouldering bunting for some colour which might  denote the nationality of the derelict, when I was startled by a loud shout  from below. Hastily descending, I found my three companions grouped together in  front of the main entrance to the cuddy, and evidently in a state of high  excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  get away, Brown,&rdquo; one of the seamen was saying; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had enough an&rsquo; to spare  of this cussed old hooker!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, Dyson?&rdquo; I asked of the bo&rsquo;sun, who stood wiping his forehead with  his neckerchief, and looking rather scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matter  enough, sir, in there,&rdquo; replied he, pointing to the dark cabin entrance. &ldquo;We  just stepped in, an&rsquo; Brown struck a light, when, who should we see, when we  turns round, but Old Nick hisself, a-leanin&rsquo; agen the mizzenmast, an&rsquo; a-grinnin&rsquo;  at us like one o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo;  I exclaimed angrily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ashamed of you, bo&rsquo;sun, I am indeed! The idea of you  talking such rubbish!&rdquo; and, stepping into the cabin, which was almost in  darkness, I struck a match from the open box in my hand, and looked around. I  must confess that, as I did so, I heartily excused the boatswain and his mates  their terror, for, although I did not budge an inch, I was scarcely less  frightened myself for a minute or two.</p>
<p>Exactly  facing me, and not more than a foot away, supported, apparently, by the casing  of the mizzenmast, was a human skeleton, gleaming whitely in the feeble light  of the match.</p>
<p>The  men were now close at my heels, and telling the other seaman, whose name was  Johnson, to go up on the poop, clear away the sail, and open the main skylight  and booby-hatch, I struck some more matches, and proceeded farther along the  large saloon.</p>
<p>Presently  down came a flood of glorious sunshine, streaming into the cabin, illumining  with its rays the poor skeleton&mdash;lashed to the mast, as we soon discovered, by  many turns of the chain main-tack&mdash; and revealing a scene of confusion and  disorder almost indescribable.</p>
<p>The  stateroom doors were all either shattered to pieces by bullets, dozens of which  were embedded in the woodwork round about, or, wrenched altogether from their  hinges, were lying on the floor, which was littered with all kinds of female  and male wearing apparel, broken bottles, papers, straw, crockery, cutlery, and  all the usual paraphernalia of a big ship&rsquo;s saloon and pantry, and, to boot,  the contents of its passengers&rsquo; luggage.</p>
<p>Mould,  damp, and mildew were everywhere; and everywhere, spite of open doors and  skylights, was a foetid, rotting, nauseous odour that seemed to hang thickly  about and defy dispersal.</p>
<p>We  searched the berths, but they were all empty, and then, as if by mutual  consent, we found ourselves once more facing the grim emblem of mortality that  grinned at us from its iron bonds,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you think of it, Dyson?&rdquo; I asked at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lashed  there alive, sir,&rdquo; muttered the old boatswain, as he pointed to the bony arms  of the skeleton, which, as I now observed, were indeed tied back behind the  mast, &ldquo;an&rsquo; for the Lord knows how long, carried about the sea. I never did hear  tell o&rsquo; sich a thing,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but my mind misdoubted somethin&rsquo; was wrong,  spite o&rsquo; the pritty figgerhead, when I sees how the craft&rsquo;s name had been  a-wiped out. There&rsquo;s been rum doin&rsquo;s aboard here, sir; but I can&rsquo;t get the hang  o&rsquo; the thing rightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wouldn&rsquo;t stay a night aboard her,&rdquo; here put in Johnson, &ldquo;if anybody &rsquo;ud give me  a hundred pounds down in solid coined gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same  here, matey,&rdquo; chimed in Brown; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever got sich a bad scare  afore, an&rsquo; who knows what might happen to a feller in the dark night-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  papers strewn about the saloon floor were mostly, as I soon discovered, blank  leaves of log-books, and the greater number were simply parcel-wrappers. Not  one scrap of writing or print even rewarded my search, and I began to think  that everything had been carefully gone over before. At this moment, and just  as the boatswain and myself were on our knees gingerly turning over some of the  clothing, most of which had evidently at one time been of rich and costly  material, we were startled by Brown&rsquo;s voice shouting down the skylight, &ldquo;Mr.  Staunton, sir, the ship&rsquo;s signalling us; and there&rsquo;s a big squall cornin&rsquo;!&rdquo; We  hastily ran out on deck and up the poop ladder. There, abeam, was the <i>Minnehaha</i> busily clearing up and stowing  her light sails; whilst, just beyond her, the sky was black as night. From her  peak hung the ensign, which, even as we looked, blew out flat, a small square  of bright colour against the dark background of wind, rain, and sea, which was  coming along like a racehorse. Now she fired three guns in quick succession,  and before the echoes of the last one had died away, we were in the boat, and  pulling like madmen away from the derelict.</p>
<p>We  had scarcely gone a hundred yards before I saw that it was too late. The squall  would be upon us ere we could cover a quarter of the distance to the <i>Minnehaha</i>. For a moment I hesitated,  then shouting, &ldquo;Back, men, for your lives!&rdquo; I brought the rudder hard over, and  in a few minutes more we were scrambling up the derelict&rsquo;s side. Bringing the  remainder of the provisions and the water-keg on board, we passed our boat  astern. Not a bit too soon had we gained shelter, for, already, not more than a  cable&rsquo;s length away, roared the furious squall, coming with a rush of wind and  white water heavy enough to have swamped the stoutest boat that ever floated.</p>
<p>It  struck the old derelict fairly abeam, heeling her over, over, over, till I  really thought she was going to turn turtle with us altogether. But she was  probably used to this kind of thing, for in a minute or two, during which her  lower yardarms ploughed great white furrows in the water, she righted, and slowly  turning her stern to the wind, began to make a little headway. I ran to the  wheel to help her if I could, but found it completely useless, the rudder  chains and blocks being simply masses of rust</p>
<p>The  sea was fast getting up, and spray was beginning to fly over the tall bulwarks  of the pitching, lurching derelict, whose timbers creaked and groaned  complainingly, while all sorts of strange noises came up from her hold, noises  of something rolling, bounding, and clattering from side to side of the ship at  every wild stagger that she gave.</p>
<p>As  we listened wonderingly to all this racket, an exclamation from the boatswain  made me turn my eyes to where, bringing with her a still stronger wind, the <i>Minnehaha</i> was bearing straight down upon  us, foaming along under three close-reefed topsails and fore and mizzen  staysails.</p>
<p>As  the <i>Minnehaha</i> drew closer we could  distinctly see the figures of the crew as they crowded along the weather-rail  and waved their hats to us by way of encouragement. The captain and the chief  officer were standing by the wheel, looking anxiously up at the huge, wallowing  prison in which we had allowed ourselves to be entrapped.</p>
<p>Presently,  seeing that we were determined, involuntarily on our part, God knows, to cut  the running out for him, our captain set his maintopsail, braced his yards up,  and kept away on our weather-bow, with, for our comfort, the &ldquo;rendezvous&rdquo; flag  flying at the mizzen-peak.</p>
<p>It  was by this getting well on in the afternoon, and the squall had grown into a  roaring gale, which howled and screeched through our rigging, banging the  swinging yards about, and hooting and whistling around the tenant-less  forecastle and along the wet decks, like some wild and evil spirit, as the ship  of death and mystery wallowed and tottered and slid over the great waves,  coming to and falling off at her own sweet will and pleasure, but, somehow,  always just in the nick of time.</p>
<p>Casting  a last look at the <i>Minnehaha</i>, now  fast fading away on the murky horizon, I stumbled aft to see to the boat,  altogether forgotten in the absorbing interest of watching the manoeuvres of  our own vessel.</p>
<p>As  might have been expected, she was gone, not a vestige of her anywhere to be  seen, with the exception of the loose painter, which I mechanically hauled in,  and to the end of which the drawn ringbolt out of the gig&rsquo;s bows was still  attached.</p>
<p>The  men said very little. That grim sight in the cabin and the incessant and  inexplicable noises that pervaded the vessel had taken a lot of heart out of  them, and I knew that, with the kind of night that was before us, a light of  some-sort was an imperative necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bo&rsquo;sun,&rdquo;  I said, &ldquo;forage around for oil. There must be some in her somewhere. It&rsquo;s stuff  that doesn&rsquo;t rot. I saw a swing-lamp in the saloon; we&rsquo;ll light that and any  others we may find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  then what I had expected came to pass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beggin&rsquo;  your pardon, sir,&rdquo; said Johnson, &ldquo;me an&rsquo; Brown here would sooner stay on deck  all night than go back into that there saloon for one single hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please  yourself, lads,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;she is bound to broach-to through the night with a  sea like this on, and I reckon, if you&rsquo;re not both overboard, we&rsquo;ll soon have  you in the cabin with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  words were scarcely out of my mouth when Dyson shrieked out, &ldquo;Into the rigging  for your lives!&rdquo; and in less time than it takes to write it we were half-way up  the main-shrouds. Looking aft, I saw a huge wall of water overhanging the poop.  The derelict&rsquo;s way seemed suddenly stopped, as if she saw the futility of  attempting to escape, then down fell the avalanche with a noise like thunder,  burying everything beneath it and roaring away for&rsquo;ard till it found an exit  through the broken bulwarks. But that her deck-fittings, skylights, galley,  etc., were of most exceptional strength, they must all have gone; and, assuredly,  had we been a few minutes later in gaining our place of refuge, we should have  been swept away like four straws into the seething wilderness around us. After  this the derelict, appearing to think that she had done enough scudding for one  night, hove herself to in a kind of a way, but any ship less high out of the  water would have been swamped over and over again. There was no more talk about  not going into the cabin; and presently in one of the after-lockers we had the  luck to find a drum of oil, besides several lamps, including a big riding  light, so that soon we had the saloon quite brilliantly illuminated.</p>
<p>Very  fortunately, as it now turned out, when leaving the <i>Minnehaha</i>, the steward had packed away a more than ample supply of  provisions, and these, having been stowed away in one of the top bunks of the  saloon berths, had escaped the general wetting. Bringing everything to the  table, I, first giving each man a glass of rum, served out all round a biscuit,  a slice of pork, and a lump of cheese. Rescue was so uncertain that I thought  it best to husband our resources as much as possible. There might be food left  on the derelict, and water also, but, again, there might not be a scrap or drop  of anything. The men&rsquo;s spirits rose considerably after this repast; though, for  the matter of that, all our glances wandered irresistibly, now and again, to  the gaunt, woeful figure that, half in shadow, half in a bright light, seemed  to preside at the head of the table.</p>
<p>There  are few men nowadays more stubbornly superstitious than your average  merchant-seaman, and it would have taken very little indeed to have frightened  Brown and Johnson completely out of their wits, half believing already, as they  did, that they were on board of an enchanted, haunted vessel on which they were  doomed to roam the seas for evermore; and so catching is terror that whilst  Dyson was not much less scared than the pair, I myself was beginning to feel  the effect of their pale, frightened faces and sudden starts of alarm. As we  moved on in a body out on to the deck, the lamp casting uncertain quivering  patches of white light on the slippery, discoloured planking, we felt, as we  hung on to stanchions, corners, anything we could get hold of, that the gale  was increasing in violence, although the sea was not quite so high as before;  the wind blowing with such terrific force at times as to keep it down in a  sheet of dazzling foam, off which it every minute hurled pieces at us that cut  and stung our flesh as if they had been snowballs.</p>
<p>At  length, exhausted and half-blinded, we gained the poop, and, with infinite  trouble and difficulty, succeeded in lashing the massive copper lantern about  half-way up the mizzen-rigging, whence it cast a flickering streak of light,  now on the foam-flecked water, now on the ship, as she lay sometimes in a deep  gully, at others nearly on her beam-ends at the summit of a monstrous roller.  The night was black as pitch, and the shrieking of the gale, the rush and roar  of water on the main-deck, with, aloft, the creaking and working of the spars,  made such an incessant hurly-burly that speech was impossible, and we were all  glad to find ourselves back in the saloon, to which the lights imparted, at  least a semblance of security, although at times a stream of water would glide  in over the high wash-boards at each of the three doors. The din, too, here was  muffled and subdued, coming only on the ears as a combined, sullen, ceaseless  roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  she&rsquo;s a furriner is sartain,&rdquo; said Dyson presently, as we recovered a little  from our exertions. &ldquo;Most likely a Spanisher or a Portugee, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s many a  long year agone since she were builded. They don&rsquo;t make &rsquo;em like that nowadays,  sir,&rdquo; pointing, as he spoke, to the huge beams and stanchions that made  themselves visible here and there about the saloon. &ldquo;But where she&rsquo;s from, or  where bound to when they left her, I can&rsquo;t give a notion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am as much at fault as yourself, bo&rsquo;sun,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;But maybe we&rsquo;ll find out  a little more about her when daylight comes. Did you ever come across a  derelict before Dyson?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;When I was in the old <i>Neptune</i>,  packet-ship, across the Western   Ocean, we boarded a  derelick, as they calls &rsquo;em. A Quebecer she were&mdash;a timber drogher. Nothin&rsquo; on  her but a big, half-starved New-founlan&rsquo; dog. But she were a honest, fair, an&rsquo;  above-board derelick, she were, not like this skilitin, no-name, prancin&rsquo;  furriner;&rdquo; and the boatswain, casting around a look expressive of the most  intense disgust, continued&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  but some murderin&rsquo;, bloody-minded Dago&nbsp;  would ever ha&rsquo; thought o&rsquo; lashin&rsquo; a man &mdash;like enough it&rsquo;s the skipper  himself&mdash;to his own mizzenmast! By Gosh! sir, it beats all I ever heerd tell on.  Eat alive, too, as like as not, by the rats. Why, when me and Johnson there  went into the midship-house arter the oil the place was a-swarmin&rsquo; with &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  news threw light on a subject which had puzzled me not a little. I had  particularly noticed how perfectly clean and bare every bone of the skeleton  was, and I knew that it must have taken a very long period of time unaided to  have completed such a process, most likely many years, years in which the  masts, yards, and standing-gear of the ship, if not herself, would inevitably  suffer decay from dry-rot and neglect; whilst, on the contrary, with the  exception of the exposed canvas and some of the running-gear, everything was  comparatively strong and well-preserved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  Almighty protect us!&rdquo; at this moment exclaimed Dyson. &ldquo;What is them unearthly  noises down below?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a long lull in the gale as the boatswain spoke, at the same time starting  to his feet, and the derelict giving two or three sharp rolls, there came  distinctly to our ears from the hold a sound as of many people thumping with  mallets at the ship&rsquo;s sides. Then there would be a pause, broken by a long,  sliding, crashing noise, as if a whole shoal of crockery had fetched way to  leeward with the roll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  only the ballast shifting, bo&rsquo;sun,&rdquo; I said, as we listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  sir,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;that noise comes from the &rsquo;tween decks&mdash;an&rsquo; ballast ain&rsquo;t  usually carried there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; I replied impatiently, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s some of the cargo, passengers&rsquo; luggage, or  something of the kind. We&rsquo;ll take the hatches off in the morning, and see what  all the row&rsquo;s about down there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  two seamen had, for some time past, been fast asleep at the saloon table, their  heads between their arms, and their bodies swaying and jerking uncomfortably  with every wild movement of the vessel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  feel more easy in my mind, sir,&rdquo; said the boatswain presently, &ldquo;if I knowed  what this craft carried for cargo in her &rsquo;tween decks. The lazarette hatch is  just be-aft the table there. S&rsquo;pose, sir, you an&rsquo; me takes a light an&rsquo; goes  down. Mebbe, as in a good many ships, there&rsquo;s only a gratin&rsquo; rigged up to  divide the storeroom from the &rsquo;tween decks, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;ll be able to get a look  through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  tell the truth, I had not by this time any too much stomach for the adventure;  but I was not going to be outdone in courage by one whom I had more than once  mentally accused of pusillanimity, so, unhooking one of the wildly-swinging  lamps, I made my way to the extreme end of the long saloon. The small hatch was  firmly secured by a cross-bar and staple of iron. As I glanced back down the  dim vista of the cabin whilst Dyson was busy with the fastenings, I thought I  had never set eyes on a drearier, more eerie scene; scarcely lit up as it was  by the single swaying lamp, right under which were the two uneasily-shifting  bodies of the sleepers; on each hand the long range of empty, yawning staterooms,  the floor and table all littered with rubbish and wet with sea water, whilst at  the farther end, only just visible in the feeble light, stood the swathed  skeleton.</p>
<p>My  nerves are, I believe, fairly strong, but what with the time, and the  surroundings that I had just been taking in, I own that when Dyson, at last,  with a wrench, pulled off the hatch, disclosing a dark square hole up which  ascended in double intensity the rank, foetid odour I have before spoken of&mdash;I  own, I say, that I hesitated, and half hoped that the boatswain, the proposer  of the excursion, would take the light from my hand and lead the way.</p>
<p>But  he did no such thing. So, lowering the lamp, I set my foot on the broad rung of  the ladder thus disclosed to view, and cautiously descended, closely followed  by Dyson.</p>
<p>My  appearance was heralded by the scampering of thousands of small feet, mingled  with shrill squeaks of alarm and rage. I thought of the skeleton, and shivered  as I listened.</p>
<p>Landing  safely on the lower deck, and placing my lamp on an iron tank near by, I gazed  curiously around.</p>
<p>And  truly there was enough to excite anyone&rsquo;s curiosity!</p>
<p>Instead  of the usual grating, a solid bulkhead of great thickness stretched right  across from one side of the ship to the other.</p>
<p>Casks,  cases, baskets of all sizes and descriptions lay scattered around, most of them  open and their contents mouldy, decaying, and gnawed, strewing the place.</p>
<p>But  the object which at once arrested our attention was a large brass gun &mdash; an 18-pounder,  Dyson said&mdash;which, mounted on its carriage, with all its tackling complete, was  pointed for&rsquo;ard through a large opening in the bulkhead.</p>
<p>Catching  up my lamp, I was tumbling towards this opening, or port-hole, when the  boatswain, grabbing me by the shoulder, stammered in a horror-stricken voice,  pointing to the &rsquo;tween decks, where still the noises continued with every  movement of the vessel, &ldquo;Dead men&rsquo;s bones, as sure as there&rsquo;s a God above us!  Look here, sir,&rdquo; he continued, holding up to the light a large, bulbous,  conical object of a reddish colour, &ldquo;this is grape-shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you see, sir?&rdquo; replied the boatswain, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s been awful goings-on here! A  coolie ship, or somethin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the kind, an&rsquo; the whole cargo on &rsquo;em mowed down  with shot in the &rsquo;tween decks there, an&rsquo; the bodies left to the rats. No wonder  there&rsquo;s rows when, perhaps, six or seven hundred skilitins gets a-rollin&rsquo; an&rsquo;  smashin&rsquo; about in a sea like this! Nothin&rsquo; else nor a floatin&rsquo; slaughter-house;  sure&rsquo;s my name&rsquo;s John Dyson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But,  unconvinced, I passed on towards the muzzle of the cannon, and, stooping,  peered through the aperture, which was jagged and splintered as if hurriedly  cut with an axe.</p>
<p>As  I gazed, the vessel gave a sharp, sudden hoist to port, and a heap of something  came sliding, rattling, and crashing just beneath me.</p>
<p>Lowering  my lamp, as it sped swiftly by on the smooth deck, I saw that it was indeed a  confused heap of bones, glistening white as ivory. As I followed them with my  eyes disappearing into the darkness of the wings, five or six round objects  came bounding singly along, one of which hit me a sharp blow on the side of the  head, whilst another knocked the lamp out of my hands clear away into the black  void beyond me, not before, however, I had recognised the thing with its  grinning jaws and empty sockets. It was a human skull.</p>
<p>I  am not ashamed to confess that I now altogether lost my presence of mind under  this grim bombardment, and hastily turning, I staggered and stumbled towards  where a feeble gleam of light showed the position of the ladder and the  hatchway.</p>
<p>Quick  as I was, the boatswain was up before me, and if ever two thoroughly scared men  looked into each other&rsquo;s pale faces, it was the pair of us as we regained our  old places in the saloon, fronting the still slumbering seamen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coolies,  you said, bo&rsquo;sun,&rdquo; I remarked, as soon as I had in some measure collected my  scattered wits, &ldquo;what would a coolie ship be doing hereabouts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s  to tell, Mr. Staunton, sir,&rdquo; rejoined Dyson, &ldquo;where she fust come from? She  might ha&rsquo; been bound round the Horn to Valparaiser or the Chinchis. An&rsquo; then,  when this here wholesale slaughterin&rsquo; takes place, an&rsquo; the crew mutinies an&rsquo;  battens the Chinkies, an&rsquo; perhaps the passengers too, for all we knows, down in  the &rsquo;tween decks; what does they do but gets the gun into the lazarette there,  an&rsquo; shoves the grape into the poor devils, on the idea that dead men tells no  tales. I mayn&rsquo;t ha&rsquo; got altogether the right drift o&rsquo; the thing, but I can&rsquo;t  see no other. An&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued the boatswain, &ldquo;this here derelick, high out o&rsquo;  the water, an&rsquo; as strong as a castle, might ha&rsquo; come right acrost here on her  own hook with her cussed loading o&rsquo; rats an&rsquo; skilitins. Dash me!&rdquo; he exclaimed,  &ldquo;if I think I ever got such a turn as when I hears that lamp a-gettin&rsquo; knocked  out o&rsquo; your hand by one o&rsquo; them bouncin&rsquo; bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Dyson,&rdquo; I retorted indignantly, &ldquo;you were half-way up the ladder almost before  I made a start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; replied he, with a half-laugh, &ldquo;I reckon neither of us lost much time.  And anyways, I&rsquo;m glad we knows the reason now of that infamal rumpus down  there; though I must say I never did think it was as bad&rsquo;s it is. I&rsquo;ll just go  up on the poop an&rsquo; get a mouthful o&rsquo; fresh air, an&rsquo; see if the light&rsquo;s a-burnin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Awaking  the two seamen, but saying nothing to them of our adventure, we all went on  deck.</p>
<p>The  light was still burning, but very dimly. However, as the dawn was beginning to  break, that was of little moment.</p>
<p>All  that remained was to wait and hope that the <i>Minnehaha</i> was not very far away. Nor was she. For, when the daylight fully broke,  ascending into the mizzen-top, I saw, about three miles away, hove-to under a  topsail and couple of staysails, our own little ship; and the comfort and  relief the sight afforded me would be hardly appreciated by anyone who had not  spent such a night as I had. It was wonderful how she had contrived so well to  keep in touch with us. But, as we afterwards discovered, it was our riding  light in the rigging that did it. With their night-glasses, her look-outs had  scarcely lost sight of us for five minutes together.</p>
<p>I  cheered and waved my hat to the anxious watchers below, who heartily responded.</p>
<p>A  few minutes later, the <i>Minnehaha</i>,  with her yards just checked, ran down close to us, riding easily over the  billows, at times perched like some great bird right on the summit of one;  then, with a long, slow, heaving slide, leaning over till the morning sun shone  on her bright copper, she would swoop down the steep green incline and be for a  moment lost to view, with the exception of her royal yards just showing above  the watery mountain-tops, till, presently, she again ascended, a glorious  fabric, instinct with life and grace and human skill in her every motion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wonders, now,&rdquo; said the boatswain, as we stood holding on to the mizzen-rigging  and watching her, &ldquo;how the old man means to get us out of this fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However,  that it was the captain&rsquo;s intention to lower a boat we soon discovered,  although how she would approach close enough to the storm-swept derelict to be  of any service to us passed our comprehension. We now saw, so close was the <i>Minnehaha</i>, the hands lie aft in a body,  and almost before we realised what was going on, the lifeboat, so called from  her being built in watertight compartments and her double bows, was in the  water full of men, and pulling towards us. More often out of than in sight, as  the great waves hid her in their valleys, on she came gallantly, making for the  derelict&rsquo;s stern, where we stood ready with lines to heave to her.</p>
<p>I  could see the first officer, as he hung on with all his might to the long,  powerful steering-oar, bareheaded, with the angry spray flying like hail over  himself and the crew.</p>
<p>Now  a huge billow lifted the boat nearly level with the derelict&rsquo;s quarter-gallery,  only escaping destruction by a miracle of skilful steering. At this moment  Dyson hove his line, for so close were we that they could almost have touched  us with their oars, yet in a trice they were a hundred yards away on the  quarter.</p>
<p>Hauling  in our line, we found attached to it the end of a new one, to which was made  fast a life-buoy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; exclaimed Dyson, as he unbent the half-rotten rope we had  hove from the derelict. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s risky, but the old man&rsquo;s right. It&rsquo;s the only  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whilst  saying this the boatswain had got into the buoy, to which, of course, another  line from the boat, as well as ours, was attached. We waved our hats to those  in the lifeboat as a signal, and Dyson, watching his chance, sprang overboard,  and, half pulled, half swimming as we rapidly paid out line, was at length  dragged safely into the boat.</p>
<p>Being  a capital swimmer, I had decided to go last, and, after seeing the two seamen  in safety, I hauled back the buoy and in my turn leaped over the taffrail, and  though, being without the saving check exerted by the inboard line, I was  carried a long way to leeward and half smothered by being dragged by those in  the boat through the tops of the waves, instead of being allowed to make my own  way over them, I had the satisfaction at length of feeling myself pulled by a  dozen strong arms into the boat, in the stern-sheets of which I laid gasping  and draining.</p>
<p>In  less than half an hour we all stood, little the worse for our adventure, on  board of our own vessel, along whose decks, before the davit-tackles had been  well made fast, sounded the sharp orders, &ldquo;Reefs out of the top&rsquo;sls!&rdquo; &ldquo;Loose  foresail and mainsail!&rdquo; &ldquo;Set the main-to&rsquo;gall&rsquo;ns&rsquo;l!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our  story, as may be imagined, excited no end of comment and conjecture from those  on board of the <i>Minnehaha</i>, and many  were the yarns spun that passage, both in saloon and forecastle&mdash;</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Of pirates upon the Spanish Main,<br>
And ships that never came back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Duly  recorded, too, was the occurrence in the official log-book, extracts from  which, in course of time, appeared in <i>Lloyd&rsquo;s</i> and a few other nautical journals; but, so far as I was able to learn, without  doing anything towards clearing up the mystery of the wandering vessel, which,  with the gruesome remnants of her ill-fated occupants, is possibly, even yet,  drifting, ever drifting, becalmed or tempest-tossed, perhaps not far from where  we first sighted her, perhaps now in distant seas, with still the beautiful  image, pointing heavenward, before her; still bound to her mast, with its bonds  of iron, the grim skeleton; still, in windy weather, clattering along her hold  those others, fated only to disclose their terrible secret when the sea shall  give up its dead.</p>
<p class="note">Happening,  some months after our curious experience, to be in Canton, and chancing to  mention the occurrence to one of the &ldquo;agents&rdquo; then employed to procure coolie  labour, he remarked: &ldquo;With the exception of the figurehead, your description  would suit to a nicety a vessel that sailed from Macao bound for the Peruvian  coast so long ago as April 1866. She carried nearly six hundred coolies under  an eight years&rsquo; agreement, and has never been heard of since. Her name was the  Napoleon Canavero, But her figurehead was that of an armed man, so that it must  have been some other ship.&rdquo; Shortly after this came the news that the crew of  the Napoleon Canavero had mutinied, and set fire to the vessel before leaving  her, thus consigning the whole of the unfortunates who composed her cargo,  together with her officers, to a horrible death.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MyFirstVoyage"></a>My First  Voyage</b></h2>
<p>As  a general thing sailors do not care much about having their captain&rsquo;s womankind  on board. By sailors, here, I mean deep-sea sailing-ship Jacks, not steamboat  men.</p>
<p>The  crew of the <i>Andover</i>, then, growled when they sighted  petticoats aft, and learned that they belonged to the captain&rsquo;s wife and her  unmarried sister.</p>
<p>They  came on board at Gravesend. I was tying up  bundles of vegetables to hang under the boats, and wondering to myself whether  Marryatt&rsquo;s dashing midshipmen ever had such unromantic work allotted them. Some  of the men were near by, shipping the after-hatches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow  the wimmen!&rdquo; I heard one say, as they all took a squint towards the gangway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  them&rsquo;s passengers,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re allus a-havin&rsquo; ructions among  theirselves. If them&rsquo;s the old man&rsquo;s, it&rsquo;s wuss still&mdash;a sight wuss. They&rsquo;re  everlastin&rsquo; a-spyin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; a-carryin&rsquo; tales, an&rsquo; a-naggin&rsquo; the skipper till he  gets his temper hout, an&rsquo; that makes it bad for we. Blow wimmen&mdash;&rsquo;specially  skipper&rsquo;s wimmen&mdash; on board o&rsquo; a ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An  affirmative grunt all round showed that his audience was with the speaker.</p>
<p>I  smiled as I thought how little the question concerned me personally.</p>
<p>Before  the end of the passage I had reason to change my opinion. Before the end of the  voyage I changed it again.</p>
<p>I  was a delicate-looking lad in those first days of my sea-life, just fourteen,  and fresh from school; not very strong, but active enough, and with pale cheeks  and long curly hair. The latter was soon trimmed off. I did not like the  nickname of &ldquo;Dolly&rdquo; it conferred, to say nothing of the advantage it gave  &ldquo;Mother Redcap&rdquo; in our frequent interviews.</p>
<p>I  messed with the sailmaker and carpenter, and they were kind enough, as, indeed,  was everyone except the skipper&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>She  was a very stout, red-faced, loud-spoken woman of about forty, who ruled her  husband most absolutely, and, as you shall presently see, through him, the  whole ship.</p>
<p>One  day, having to wash one of her three poodles, I let a splash of soap get into  his eyes, whereupon he set up a dismal howling. This brought the brute&rsquo;s  mistress on the scene. Getting a good grip of my hair, she boxed my ears  soundly. From that time forward she took every possible opportunity of boxing  them.</p>
<p>Being  the only apprentice, I had, unfortunately, no one to share these favours with.  All I could do was to get my hair cut.</p>
<p>Once,  indeed, the captain ventured a faint remonstrance. Actually I felt sorry for  him when I heard the torrent it called forth.</p>
<p>If  this sea-virago thought there was too much sail on, she would make him take  some off; if not enough, have more set.</p>
<p>It  was a sight to watch her in a stiff breeze, standing legs firmly planted and  wide apart, close to the wheel, her big fat face shining out from under a thick  red woollen cap she habitually wore on deck, and glancing now at the compass,  now at the sails, whilst the officer in charge glared furtively up at her from  some nook to leeward, and the helmsman swallowed his quid in an effort to keep  from sniggering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo;  she would perhaps boom in her deep bass, and when the captain, a mild-mannered  little man, with a look in his eyes as of one momentarily in fear of being hit,  unwillingly appeared,&mdash;&ldquo;John, you&rsquo;d better take that maintopgallant sail in. I&rsquo;ve  been watching it these last ten minutes; it&rsquo;s making her jump frightfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  first time this sort of thing happened the man at the wheel, in spite of all  his struggles, brayed out into a great &ldquo;Haw! haw! haw!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  she turned upon him, shook her fist in his face, and gave him a terrible  tongue-thrashing; and finally had him sent for&rsquo;ard for impertinence.</p>
<p>Sometimes  the men laughed at her, at others they swore. The first and second mates&rsquo; lives  she made a burden to them.</p>
<p>One  after the other her three pets disappeared. The ship was in an uproar for a  week afterwards. Saturday night&rsquo;s grog was stopped. There were no plums in the  duff on Sunday.</p>
<p>First  she accused one, then another. Finally she settled the whole three on my  unlucky shoulders. If I had not been very cautious I truly believe she would  have sent me after them. She was as strong as a horse, and could easily lift me  off the deck with one hand in the collar of my shirt. Well would it have been  for us if she had made no more pets!</p>
<p>The  men said she drank, but I never detected the smell of spirits about her, and do  not believe she ever touched them.</p>
<p>She  possessed a sextant of her own, and used to &ldquo;shoot the sun&rdquo; in regular  professional style. The <i>Andover</i> was  only a small barque, and the duties of second mate and boatswain were performed  by one man&mdash;a rather rough old sailor. She fell foul of him once, and he came  stamping into our house in a state of high exasperation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  blasted ole halbatross,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;is goin&rsquo; to boss this hooker fore an&rsquo;  aft! The cheek of her a-tellin&rsquo; me&mdash;<i>me</i>,  what&rsquo;s been bo&rsquo;sun o&rsquo; ships that this un wouldn&rsquo;t make a long-boat for&mdash;as I  didn&rsquo;t keep things aloft in very good order! But I think I gives her one for  it. Sez I, mighty perlite, sez I, &lsquo;Ye can&rsquo;t see very well from the deck, mum,&rsquo;  I sez. &lsquo;Now if ye was to ship a pair o&rsquo; unmentionables, mum, an&rsquo; take a trip up  yerself, mebbe, mum, ye&rsquo;d halter yer &rsquo;pinion.&rsquo; At this she lets out, steerin&rsquo;  fine an&rsquo; free, an&rsquo; the skipper comes along, so I clears. But if hever there was  hell in petticoats that&rsquo;s Her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was one incident of many such, and served to show the absolute ascendency the  woman had gained over her husband in all ways.</p>
<p>Her  sister was a very pretty <i>petite</i> brunette, kind and gentle in her manner, and with a pleasant word or smile for  everyone. The crew swore by her. To everyone on board for&rsquo;ard of the break of  the poop she was known as &ldquo;Miss Fanny.&rdquo; They resolutely, however, refused to  believe that the pair were sisters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;ye  think,&rdquo; I once heard said scornfully in one of the frequent arguments held on  the subject, &mdash; &ldquo;d&rsquo;ye think, for a minnit, as the old man &rsquo;d ha&rsquo; took Mother  Redcap when, chances is, he might just as well ha&rsquo; had t&rsquo;other un? Not likely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay,&rdquo; replied another, more worldly wise. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right enuff, &rsquo;s fer &rsquo;s it  goes. But ye see, Bill, the old mother, yonder, mos&rsquo; likely held the rupees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  this, I believe, really was the fact of the matter. Anyhow, the married sister  seldom interfered with the younger one. If she did, she was pretty sure to get  the worst of it. A very delicate vein of sarcasm did Miss Fanny possess, which  pierced the other&rsquo;s blustering, overbearing spirit like a fine rapier.</p>
<p>It  was her first voyage with her brother-in-law, and she appeared to enjoy it  immensely.</p>
<p>Many  a time did she protect me against the unjust wrath of her gigantic relative, or  save some little delicacy from the cabin-table to console me in unmerited  affliction.</p>
<p>Our  destination was Batavia,  the capital of Java. You couldn&rsquo;t find in any part of the seafarer&rsquo;s world a  worse port in which to bolt from a ship. Capture swift and certain if you  deserted, fever in any case.</p>
<p>The  Dutch are averse to visitors of whatever rank they may happen to be. Penniless  sailors they won&rsquo;t put up with for a minute. But for this well-known fact, I  believe, so tired were both seamen and officers of their captain&rsquo;s wife, her  caprices and pranks, that they would have left the ship in a body.</p>
<p>Even  then, as now, the Dutch were in the midst of one of their periodical &ldquo;little  wars&rdquo; with the Acheenese. But that did not stop us from obtaining nearly a full  cargo of coffee, castor-oil, sago, spice, and other Eastern products.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Stanley, the captain&rsquo;s wife, tried hard to get some poodles. But either they  were not acclimatised or we did not go the right way to work. She dragged me  ashore one roasting, sweltering day to assist in the search. Before we had gone  half a mile from the landing-place she quarrelled with the driver of the  two-pony trap she had hired, and insisted on getting out and walking.</p>
<p>We  each spread an enormous umbrella, and must have presented an astounding  spectacle to the few people awake at that time, as we poked about in the  broiling sun, disturbing and closely scrutinising the hordes of hungry,  starving mongrels that lay in every patch of shade. At last, fairly exhausted,  she pulled up at the Zoological Gardens.</p>
<p>Here,  to my surprise, the animals were mostly rabbits, cats, foxes, and dogs, in  place of the tigers and elephants one might reasonably expect.</p>
<p>There  were two fine poodles.</p>
<p>In  spite of an offer of a handful of guilders to the Malay attendant, and an  intimation by signs that an exchange for the animals would be acceptable, he  only grinned. He grinned more than ever when she tried to express her meaning  in a most extraordinary mixture of words. Then, to my unbounded surprise, he  ejaculated, still grinning&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  you ver&rsquo; fat <i>vrauw</i>; you no doggee can  tek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  this her temper rose, and she threatened him with the handle of her umbrella.  She also called him &ldquo;an impudent nigger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  moved him, and, sounding a whistle, two other fellows in uniform, whom I took  to be policemen, ran up, and never left us till we got to our boat at the  Cheedeewong, as they call their bricked-in river.</p>
<p>We  did not go ashore any more.</p>
<p>Miss  Fanny, however, accepted an invitation from a French lady, wife of one of our  consignees, and went to a place called Buitzenorg, forty miles up country, and  stayed there until the <i>Andover</i> was  ready for sea.</p>
<p>On  our way to Singapore, whither we went to fill up with coir and sundries, we met  an island in the Straits of Rhio, a small floating island, a mere patch of  earth, with one cocoa-nut tree growing upon it</p>
<p>At  the top of this tree was perched Robinson Crusoe&mdash;the future cause of a sad  amount of misery and distress.</p>
<p>Mother  Redcap spied him first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John!&rdquo;  she exclaimed, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a monkey on that tree! Get him, and I&rsquo;ll make a pet of  him&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  had a fair wind, a thing that does not always blow in those narrow seas, and  the skipper was naturally anxious to make the most of it. Nevertheless, the  maintops&rsquo;l was backed; and the boat-falls were already cheeping through their  blocks when the little island, taking a sudden slue, came right alongside,  nearly going to pieces with the concussion.</p>
<p>Robinson  Crusoe (as he was always called), frightened by the bumping and shaking, took a  flying leap into the rigging, out of which, after a long and exciting chase, he  was dragged, with a running bow-line around his neck, to his mistress&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>He  was a big, ugly, black wretch of a monkey, with long hair, long tail, and a  villainous squint.</p>
<p>To  my unhappy lot fell the task of taming him. He was nearly as big as I was, and  quite as strong.</p>
<p>One  night he bit me, and I tried to throw him overboard. But for the help of the  helmsman it would have been the other way about.</p>
<p>Mother  Redcap grew wonderfully fond of the brute, and, in time, seeming to recognise a  congenial spirit, he returned her attachment, and followed her like a dog.</p>
<p>Very  mischievous the beast was, too. Of a night, when the men were tailing on to the  braces or the halliards, he would sneak aloft, and either hang with all his  weight against them, or, gnawing through the rope with his great sharp teeth,  send the whole watch prostrate on deck.</p>
<p>At  first many a hard tap he got with belaying-pin or handspike for his tricks. But  presently the men became afraid of him. For all the hits and cuffs received he  paid with added interest. Sooner or later the reckoning was sure to come.</p>
<p>One  day the second mate rapped him sharply over the fingers for getting in his way.</p>
<p>A  week afterwards Robinson, creeping into his berth whilst he was asleep, set  fire to his beard, which was a very fine bushy one, and burned up bravely.</p>
<p>Another  man who hit him he nearly crippled by dropping a heavy snatch-block on his  toes. And so on, and so on.</p>
<p>Knowing  how useless complaint aft would be, countless traps were laid by the men for  his destruction, all of which he evaded with an intuitive sagacity perfectly  wonderful. So much so, indeed, that the hands became frightened. Superstition  laid hold on them. The devil was on board, and they left off compassing his  death. One cannot kill the devil.</p>
<p>In Singapore  four able seamen succeeded in obtaining their discharges, but only by  volunteering for H.M.S. <i>Clyde</i>, then  in harbour, and wanting hands.</p>
<p>Their  places, however, were soon filled by others, amongst whom were an American  black and a Spaniard. After clearing the Narrow Seas  at Anjer, homeward-bound, we sped merrily along until near the Line, where,  losing the S.E. Trades, calms and light airs became the order of the day.</p>
<p>The  heat was intense, and the tempers of both Robinson Crusoe and his mistress,  naturally bad, became worse.</p>
<p>Not  that it affected the monkey physically. But he could not go aloft without the  warm tar exuding from the rigging sticking to his hands and feet, a thing he  detested. So he moped.</p>
<p>She,  being of very stout, fleshy build, got no coolness by night or by day.</p>
<p>For  three solid weeks had this weather lasted, we making nothing but leeway, when  Robinson took quite a fresh contract in hand.</p>
<p>Getting  hold of a short stout piece of wood known as a fid, and sneaking into the  steward&rsquo;s pantry, he started smashing crockery right and left. Plates, dishes,  cups, saucers, and glassware, all were presently mingled in one great ruin.</p>
<p>This,  however, was mischief too far aft. He was ordered to be imprisoned in the &ldquo;bo&rsquo;sun&rsquo;s  locker&rdquo;&mdash;a small house on deck where were kept paints, oils, turps, oakum, tar,  etc.</p>
<p>Putting  a piece of rope around his neck and pushing him in, I jammed the door on his  tail, listening to his yells with heartfelt satisfaction whilst contemplating  the deep scratch he had left on my hand.</p>
<p>As  I stood there, a violent cuff on the ear made me stagger.</p>
<p>Looking  up, I saw the inflamed features of Mother Redcap, who, unperceived, had  followed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  you little devil!&rdquo; she panted, whilst the perspiration rolled in streams off  her great, shaking fat face. &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way you treat my poor, dear Robin,  is it? Only wait till we get a breeze, and I&rsquo;ll skin you!&rdquo; making another smack  at me as she concluded.</p>
<p>But,  ducking, I escaped; and with many a rest, she waddled away into the cuddy. We  got a breeze presently, but she had other things to think about then.</p>
<p>How  well I remember that night! Forty years at sea have not effaced the  recollection of its terrors. Forty eventful years of journeyings over every  sea, and to well-nigh every land on the surface of the globe, have passed since  then; yet never a night like that one, when little more than a child, on my  first voyage.</p>
<p>The  sun set as he had set now for many a day&mdash;a sullen mass of reddest flame.  Darkness fell soft and thick, but bringing no coolness with it.</p>
<p>The  rattle of the dippers in the scuttle-butts at intervals as the men moistened  their parched throats was the only sound to be heard fore and aft. Both watches  &mdash; it was madness to think of going below&mdash;were lying cat-napping about on the  booms, fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sle-head, tops of the deck-houses, everywhere. No one was at the wheel,  no one on the look-out The courses were hauled up, topsail-yards on the caps,  mizzen brailed-in, staysails down. Everything was intensely still.</p>
<p>Not  a creak of the rudder-chains, not the gentlest lift of any sail broke the hush.  Over the side the water seemed like black oil&mdash; stirless without a ruffle. You  could see the stars reflected in its depths, and they looked hot.</p>
<p>The  captain himself was, probably, the only man on board that night who was keeping  any sort of watch at all. He was standing close to the wheel, smoking. Lying in  the stern of one of the quarter-boats, I could see the red spot of light from  his cigar, and smell the fumes from the tobacco.</p>
<p>From  him suddenly came a shout of warning and dismay that in another minute was  echoed from twenty throats as, with a patter of bare feet, men came running  along the deck towards where a great sheet of flame shot up amidships.</p>
<p>Higher,  higher, higher yet, up to the maintop, blue, yellow, and green, with direful  cracklings and explodings, it rose.</p>
<p>Then  out from the main body, as it seemed to us, staring fascinated, ascended a ball  of fire, whence issued awful shrieks, as it went swiftly up the rigging, which  followed redly in its wake.</p>
<p>Big  flakes of flame fell from it on to the sails and spars, dry as tinder with the  long windless drought They caught instantly; the hempen shrouds and stays  caught too, and undulating snakes of fire crept aloft.</p>
<p>But  above all sped the shrieking, flaming thing, until, reaching the royal-yard, it  paused so long as enabled the furled sails to ignite, and then, with a  lamentable yell, went plunging through the darkness like some terrible meteor  into the water, already beginning to redden alongside.</p>
<p>This  appeared to break the spell under whose influence all hands had been  breathlessly watching what we instinctively guessed to be the last gigantic  mischief of Robinson Crusoe&rsquo;s mischievous life.</p>
<p>The  force-pump was manned, buckets passed along, and for a time men worked like  giants.</p>
<p>But  the vessel, just abaft the main-hatch, where had stood the bo&rsquo;sun&rsquo;s locker, was  a raging volcano. It was only too evident that the cargo was on fire. When that  was realised a regular <i>sauve qui peut</i> set in.</p>
<p>And  now, O strange caprice of fate! the fair wind, so long and anxiously prayed  for, rose&mdash;now of all times&mdash;and blew strongly.</p>
<p>Beneath  our feet the deck was rifting. One could even catch glimpses of the roaring  abyss below.</p>
<p>Upon  our heads fell showers of burning wood and rope and canvas. Little wonder that  on the <i>Andover</i> discipline was at an end!</p>
<p>Some  of the men had already, by superhuman exertions, got the long-boat, and were in  her. Luckily there were plenty of boats.</p>
<p>We  of the afterguard and a few others stood by the gig.</p>
<p>The  two women were the first to be helped into her. Miss Fanny was cool enough, and  gave no trouble at all.</p>
<p>But  Mother Redcap stormed frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s  my Robin?&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go a step without him. Go and fetch him, you  imp!&rdquo; shaking her fist at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  gone to hell!&rdquo; shouted the skipper, irritated beyond endurance by her kickings  and stragglings, as he strove to pull her to the rail. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t get  into the boat you stand a good chance of following him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was speaking to the point, and it so astonished her that she allowed herself to  be bundled unceremoniously over the side without one further word of protest or  inquiry after her pet.</p>
<p>The  long-boat now pulled alongside, and, although there was still one on the  davits, a rush was made for the former.</p>
<p>I  was knocked down and trampled upon. When I came to my senses again, there was  the burning ship, two hundred yards away, outlined, every spar and stay of her,  in fire.</p>
<p>Miss  Fanny had my head upon her lap. She was crying, but very softly. Close to lay  the other three boats, black specks on the glowing water.</p>
<p>The  wind was rising fast, so was the sea.</p>
<p>Presently  the skipper hailed us, and wanted Miss Fanny to come into his boat.</p>
<p>She  replied, however, that she would stay where she was.</p>
<p>I  don&rsquo;t think she liked the prospect of Mother Redcap&rsquo;s company at such close  quarters, and that in the confusion she had purposely got into the quarter-boat  instead of the gig to avoid it. The old woman, however, was very quiet. I could  see her great face, purple with the flush of the fire on it, amongst the others  as she stood up, staring with all her might at the <i>Andover</i>.</p>
<p>Practically  we had no provisions, and no water. A few tins of soup and bouill&eacute; and some biscuits  were all our store. I do not know what the rest of the boats had.</p>
<p>If  possible, a common stock would have been made, and equally distributed. But by  this the sea ran too high for any such proceeding.</p>
<p>For  an hour we stood by the burning ship. By that time she was a mere red line on  the water&rsquo;s edge, still blazing up suddenly in parts, as fire and water strove  for the mastery.</p>
<p>Even  as we turned to take a last look, a dull, sullen roar was heard; thick darkness  enveloped us, and the curtain fell on the first act of the drama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  us try and keep together if we can,&rdquo; shouted the captain, who seemed in good  heart and steady voice, and more like a leader than I ever imagined it possible  he could become. &ldquo;The nearest land inhabited is the Western   Islands. But we are right in the track of ships. Keep N. by W. if  possible. God bless you all. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  faint cheer rose out of the darkness&mdash;a sound most inexpressibly saddening I  thought it&mdash;and then up went the sails, and hailing at intervals, we followed  each other into the night.</p>
<p>Through  the early hours of the morning the wind rose to a gale. The boat shipped water  in torrents, keeping us all busy baling. Our voices when we shouted were blown  back to us, and after a while, seeing the uselessness of it amidst such a  turmoil of wind and water, we gave up all hope of keeping in touch with the  others. When at last the dawn broke, grey and forbidding, not a trace of our  companions was visible. There were seven of us in the gig, the second mate, the  four men who signed at Singapore,  Miss Fanny, and myself.</p>
<p>We  were all dripping wet, hungry, and chilled.</p>
<p>The  second mate steered, and the boat, her sail close-reefed, climbed wearily up  the big sliding slopes and sank with flapping canvas into the deep,  water-walled valleys.</p>
<p>Towards  noon one of the men relieved the second mate at the tiller, and he served to  each a small piece of biscuit with a taste of preserved meat. The liquor in the  tin was then scrupulously divided&mdash;a sip apiece&mdash;out of the lid of a metal  match-box.</p>
<p>By close  calculation it was reckoned that we had about six similar meals left.</p>
<p>I  am not going to detail our sufferings here. Suffice it to say that they were  very terrible. Keeping too much to the westward, we found &mdash;by the time our last  morsel of food was done&mdash;that we had once more entered a region of calms. Having  no occasion for a sail, we spread it as an awning, and with apathetic eyes  watched a couple of sharks which now hovered around the boat day and night.</p>
<p>A  shark-hook had been discovered in a small locker astern, and this, baited with  one of the empty meat-tins, was hanging overboard. But they only sniffed at it  indignantly. One, swimming up, would touch it with his snout, and you could  almost swear to the derisive shake of his whole body as he turned away in  disgust.</p>
<p>Evidently  they were waiting for daintier morsels.</p>
<p>As  I said, the food was done. But now, it was not food we were craving. It was  water&mdash;water &mdash; only a drop to moisten the blackened lips and parched tongues and  choking throats!</p>
<p>Surely,  amidst those women who by unselfish example and true courage have brightened  the sad annals of shipwreck, few can excel that one devoted companion of our  misfortunes. Never complaining, always with words of cheer on her lips, a smile  for everyone on her pale, wasted features, she it was who put fresh life into  the despairing, and fearlessly, scornfully, subdued the animal nature which in  others is driven to the surface in such time of trial.</p>
<p>Once,  I remember, two of the men were fiercely quarrelling for a bit of biscuit no  larger than a nut which had fallen into the bottom of the boat and was claimed  by each. One drew his knife, and was on the point of plunging it into his mate&rsquo;s  body, when Miss Fanny, leaping forward, snatched the weapon from him and sent  it flying overboard. Then she offered him her own tiny ration, which he took  and devoured sulkily.</p>
<p>You  see the Mother Redcap spirit was there too, only showing itself in different  fashion.</p>
<p>I  don&rsquo;t know how it all came about, for during the last two days I had been  simply passing out of one restless, feverish doze into another. From one of  these I was aroused by a shake. Looking up, I saw the Spaniard, Diego.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;pull one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  his shut fist he held a number of straws, which had been taken from a scrubby  little broom usually kept in the boat.</p>
<p>Pointing  to them with his forefinger, he repeated, &ldquo;Pull one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  that child, surely!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Fanny in husky accents, a pathetic look of appeal  in her great black eyes, sunk far back into her white face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  mus&rsquo; take chance,&rdquo; replied Diego, in a voice scarce rising above a whisper, his  parched tongue almost rattling on the parched lips. &ldquo;Take chance along wid  rest&mdash;an&rsquo; wid you. We give you an&rsquo; him first chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss  Fanny said no more. Mechanically I pulled my straw, feeling no interest, no  curiosity. She too pulled one. Then the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  boy&rsquo;s got it,&rdquo; someone said.</p>
<p>The  second mate at this took my straw, and saying, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have no mistakes,&rdquo;  compared it with the other six.</p>
<p>It  was the longest, undeniably.</p>
<p>I  was now sitting up in the stern-sheets alongside of Miss Fanny. She had fallen  back and covered her face with her hands. I have thought since that she must  have been praying.</p>
<p>The  Spaniard was collecting the empty tins and arranging them under one of the  forward thwarts. It took him some time to do this. He was very weak, and no one  offered to assist him.</p>
<p>The  black had drawn a long sheath-knife, and was, with trembling, uncertain hands,  striving to sharpen it on the remnant of a leather waistbelt he had been  chewing.</p>
<p>In  all the eyes bent on me I saw an eager, hungry, impatient glare which made me  feel sick&mdash;although, yet, I did not understand.</p>
<p>But  the black, stumbling aft, caught hold of my hand, and, still grasping his  knife, strove to drag me for&rsquo;ard.</p>
<p>With  that undefined dread tugging at my heart-strings, I resisted with all my puny  strength.</p>
<p>It  proved equal to his.</p>
<p>The  Spaniard and another man came to his help, and the three with weak tugs and  grabs were forcing me along, when Miss Fanny rose, and, with wondrous strength,  clasping me in her arms, dragged me away from them, exclaiming in a loud  strange voice, whose tones seemed to startle and awe them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,  if you do this most terrible and unnatural thing, God will never forgive you!  Remember that in a few hours we may all stand before His judgment-seat to  answer for our deeds here. What folly, then, to utterly cast away all hope of  salvation by the murder of this child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  die if we don&rsquo;t, miss,&rdquo; replied one, after an irresolute pause. &ldquo;The kid&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad &rsquo;is  chance an&rsquo; must abide by it. We&rsquo;re all o&rsquo; the one mind, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t waste no more  time a-talkin&rsquo;. If ye likes, &rsquo;owever, we&rsquo;ll rig the awnin&rsquo; so&rsquo;s you shan&rsquo;t  see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very  suddenly it flashed upon my mind that I was to be butchered. Ah! the horror of  that moment of realisation. A cold sweat broke out all over my body. My heart  seemed to stop beating as I helplessly clasped and clung to my one protection  amongst that savage crew.</p>
<p>For  years afterwards, in the still watches of night, the horror of that time has  come back to me! Of course, as what lad has not, I had read of such scenes. But  to the lot of how few does it chance to be the chief actor, or rather, subject,  in one&mdash;and so soon.</p>
<p>The  men had already begun to stretch the sail curtain-wise across the boat, when,  suddenly, the latter was swung and jerked so violently around as to send all  hands head over heels.</p>
<p>That  morning someone had hauled in the useless shark-line, and, removing the tin,  substituted an old sea-boot.</p>
<p>Tired  of so long a wait, or fancying leather to be an improvement on metal, one of  the ravenous brutes had swallowed it, and was now struggling desperately with  the hook somewhere in his vitals. That horror, so imminent a minute ago, was  forgotten in the excitement of such a capture.</p>
<p>For  a time he dragged&mdash;so weak were we&mdash; the whole of us, hanging on to the halliards  which formed our line, hither and thither, often nearly overboard at his  pleasure.</p>
<p>We  could plainly hear his teeth gritting against the chain of the hook as he  gnashed and foamed and made white water all about the boat with his wild  leapings and splashings. But we prevailed at last, and inboard he came with a  bow-line over his tail and the loom of an oar jammed down his throat.</p>
<p>The  work appeared to have livened us up a bit and given us fresh strength and  spirits, augmented, presently, by the meal which followed.</p>
<p>No  need to describe that repast. Anyhow, savage as it was, it was infinitely more  satisfactory to me, and I hope to the others, than the one it prevented. Miss  Fanny alone would have none of it.</p>
<p>She  only shuddered and covered her face with her hands, as gruesome morsel or still  more gruesome fluid was offered to her.</p>
<p>The  shark was a big one. But by the second day it was putrid&mdash;unendurable. It had,  perforce, to be thrown overboard. Yet the men were loth to part with it, and  cut off great junks, which they chewed whilst watching the freshly baited hook  for another.</p>
<p>Things  would have probably ended badly after all. But, on that second day of the  taking of the shark, Diego, standing for a minute, and giving the usual  hopeless glance around the horizon, all at once shrilled out the single word,  &ldquo;Smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  an instant that wan crew were on their feet. Even Miss Fanny, who for hours had  been almost insensible, made shift to rise when I tugged at her arm.</p>
<p>We  all saw it now&mdash;that long grey flag, which meant so much to us, trailing across  the setting splendours of the sun.</p>
<p>How  intensely, breathlessly, we watched it! Then, when certain that it was coming  in our direction, men tried to shout as you may imagine spectres shouting; then  some sat down and wept, whilst others stood up and, leaning on trembling  shoulders, waved arms on high, made strange moaning noises, and laughed  discordant laughs.</p>
<p>Young  as I was I wondered at them, not feeling with such intensity the coming-out  from the valley of the shadow. How close she presently seemed! Black, with a  yellow streak, the sun-rays catching and sparkling the gilt scroll-work at her  bows, the great steamer swept down upon us, and like men in a dream we gazed  and yearned. Volumes of black smoke poured from her squat white-and-yellow-banded  funnels. The two hillocks ploughed by her forefoot out of the calm water grew  higher. Evidently her speed was increasing. Could it be possible she did not  see us? Or, terrible thought, was she some heartless foreigner who would not  pick us up if she did? She was now not a quarter of a mile distant, crossing  our bows. We could even hear the churning of her screw, and yet no sign! We  forgot all the time what a mere speck we were on that vast waste of evening sea.  Then someone screamed out, &ldquo;Oars!&rdquo; and another, &ldquo;Hoist the sail!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  steamer&rsquo;s approach had been so rapid, so direct. We had been so sure. We were  so close. No one had thought of trying to move the boat or to hoist any signal.  But now she was passing us, and the men tumbled frantically about in their  efforts to repair a mistake, probably irreparable but for the great mercy of  God. Before anything could be done I, watching the steamer as she steadily  thundered along through the falling light, saw her speed slacken. Then she  turned slowly and came towards us, closer, closer, until our boat rocked with  the wave thrown back from her huge body, and looking up, we could see rows of  curious faces staring at us.</p>
<p>Ten  minutes later we were safe on board the Cape  mail boat, <i>Libyan Monarchy</i> and my  first voyage was over.</p>
<p>Of  the remainder of the <i>Andover</i>&rsquo;s  company nothing was ever heard.</p>
<p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMasterOfTheMarathon"></a>The Master  Of The &ldquo;Marathon&rdquo;</b></h2>
<h3 align="center"><b>I</b></h3>
<p>The <i>Marathon</i>, barque, was lying at her  buoy, off Gravesend, on a wintry November  morning in 1860. She was waiting for her captain, who should have been on  board, and the chief officer, as he paced the deck impatiently, cast, every now  and again, expectant glances shoreward.</p>
<p>Presently  a boat was seen putting off. The tug, already puffing and snorting ahead, gave  a preliminary scream, and took in the slack of the tow-line, whilst the men at  the buoy stood ready to cast off the last hitch of the cable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sorry to have to tell you, Mr. Selby,&rdquo; said the senior partner of the firm that  owned the <i>Marathon</i>, as he stepped on  board and went up to the young officer, &ldquo;that Captain Marsh has met with a  serious accident, and that the doctors absolutely forbid his removal. Although  I know you will feel grieved at my bad news, I hope that&rdquo;&mdash;turning to his  companion, a tall, dark-whiskered, dashing-looking man &mdash; &ldquo;whilst introducing  you to Captain Hanlon, the new Master of the <i>Marathon</i>, you will continue to get on as pleasantly with him as you  have for so long done with poor Marsh.&rdquo; The two men bowed and shook hands. Then  Mr. Manifest, drawing Selby towards the gangway, said in a low tone&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t know very much about him; but the fact is we were really pushed for a  man. You should have had the ship yourself, Selby, if you had your master&rsquo;s  certificate. However, that will come in time. Hanlon&rsquo;s papers, though foreign,  are all A1, and he appears a smart fellow. By the bye, he knows nothing about  our special consignment. I would have told him, but my brother objected. It&rsquo;s  all right, eh?&rdquo; &ldquo;All safe, sir,&rdquo; replied the chief officer; &ldquo;carefully stowed  away at the bottom of my big chest.&rdquo; &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; continued Mr. Manifest. &ldquo;And,  look here, perhaps you had better see that Sylvestre gets it as quietly as  possible. I don&rsquo;t like this underhand work myself, and would rather let Hanlon  know all about it. But I suppose it can&rsquo;t be helped now. Only don&rsquo;t forget you  are burdened with a rather heavy responsibility. I can assure you we will not,  if you manage the affair cleverly. As for Marsh&rsquo;s things, they must stay where  they are till you return. The villains! They half killed him; and, if we can  but lay our hands on them &mdash;Why, God bless my soul, Selby, we&rsquo;re going down the  river like anything! I must be off. I&rsquo;m getting too old to go to sea again;&rdquo;  and waving a farewell to the Master, who, whilst the pair were engrossed in  their talk, had signalled the tug to &ldquo;go ahead,&rdquo; the old gentleman climbed into  his boat with an agility which did credit to his sixty years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May  I ask, sir,&rdquo; inquired Selby of the Master, the first bustle of the start over,  &ldquo;what has happened to Captain Marsh? I have been with him since I was a boy;  and the day before yesterday he was on the ship looking as well as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Concussion  of the brain, received from an accident in the streets, I believe,&rdquo; replied the  other courteously. &ldquo;But, really, I am unable to give you particulars. I chanced  to be in the office in Billiter    Square when the news arrived, and at once  volunteered to take the <i>Marathon</i> for this voyage. However, when we land our  pilot at Plymouth  and take off our passenger, we shall at the same time probably be able to get a  newspaper with full details of the occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  passenger?&rdquo; exclaimed Selby, in surprise. &ldquo;I never heard anything of one coming  with us this trip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Booked  at the last minute,&rdquo; curtly replied his commander, as, ordering his luggage to  be taken below, he presently followed it.</p>
<p>It  was a clear, cold night as the <i>Marathon</i>,  after lying-to off the Plymouth  breakwater to land her pilot and receive her passenger, again brought her  topsails to the wind and proceeded on her journey.</p>
<p>The  new-comer was a rather sullen-looking, broadly-built, elderly man, one  evidently used to ships and their ways, or at least to travelling by them, for  he had hardly got on deck ere he shouted out for the steward, his berth, and  some whisky.</p>
<p>Later  on that night, when the middle watch was far advanced, and the <i>Marathon</i>, with a freshening breeze on  the quarter, was rapidly making her way out of the &ldquo;Silver Streak,&rdquo; her Master,  glistening in oilskins and sea-boots, descended into the dimly-lighted saloon,  and giving a single sharp rap at the passenger&rsquo;s door, passed on into his own  stateroom, where he was almost at once joined by the new arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  hit hard, Tony,&rdquo; was the Master&rsquo;s salutation as he looked curiously at the man  before him. &ldquo;Hear what the paper says,&rdquo; he went on, taking up one from a heap  on the table and proceeding to read aloud a paragraph headed &ldquo;Brutal Assault on  a Shipmaster,&rdquo; at the end of which it was intimated that the victim&rsquo;s recovery  was considered doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was  it a slung shot?&rdquo; he asked unconcernedly, as he finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was, captain,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;You know the orders was to stop his goin&rsquo; to  sea for at laste six months. If the time&rsquo;s lengthened he&rsquo;s only got himself to  thank for it. He made such an infarnal row that I reckon I hit him harder than  I intinded to, an&rsquo; ran the six into a whole twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t shout,&rdquo; said the Master; &ldquo;ship&rsquo;s timbers have ears at times, as well as  walls, remember. And now you had better return to your berth. You&rsquo;re sure you  contrived to get clear away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain,&rdquo;  was the grumbling reply; &ldquo;an&rsquo; a lot o&rsquo; thanks I get for doing the thing  nately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  quite understand that there was nothing else for it under the circumstances,&rdquo;  answered Hanlon calmly. &ldquo;Go to bed; you are tired. But be very careful in the  days that are to come, to put aside all memories of our free-trade adventures  together about the world. Never forget that you are a passenger&mdash; not a sailor,  and do your best to act up to the character of Mr. Antony Brennan, an American  (or rather, I should say, an Irish-American) trader on his way back to the  East. Not a very difficult matter, surely, to one who is well acquainted with  every corner of it from Madagascar  to Manilla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Time  passed away, and the <i>Marathon</i> was near the Equator. Hanlon, by his mild and gentlemanly manners and easy  command, had gained the goodwill and esteem of both his officers and crew;  added to which he had on several occasions proved that he was a thorough  seaman, thus ensuring their confidence also. But, as a rule, he took little or  no part in the actual working of the vessel, excusing himself to his chief  officer with the remark that he had of late years been accustomed to steamers,  and had lost his interest in canvas, as, indeed, is often the case. One night,  after pacing the deck, conversing with Mr. Brennan till twelve o&rsquo;clock, the  pair went below, and Selby came up to relieve the second mate, who had been  keeping the first watch.</p>
<p>Presently,  sitting down on a hencoop, after the customary glimpse at the compass, and  longer gaze aloft and around, he saw something glistening whitely in one of the  troughs.</p>
<p>It  was bright moonlight, and picking the object up, he found it to be a letter.  Without thinking, he opened it, and seeing that it commenced <i>&ldquo;Dear and gallant captain,&rdquo;</i> was about to  fold it up again, when his eye was caught by the name &ldquo;Sylvestre,&rdquo; and a moment  afterwards, by the mention of something which brought him to his feet as if he  had been galvanised.</p>
<p>Taking  the letter over to leeward, into the shadow cast by the spanker, he read it  over from beginning to end twice. It ran as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;<i>Singapore,</i> Aug. 7, 1860.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear  and Gallant Captain,&mdash;I was unfeignedly sorry to hear of your mischance with the <i>Campeador</i> and the Cuban authorities,  and suppose that, in consequence, your fortunes are at a rather low ebb.  Someone has said, however, that every cloud, no matter how black it appears,  has a silver lining. In the particular case I am about to state, it happens to  be a golden one.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;On  or about the 12th November next, sails from London a vessel called the <i>Marathon</i>, bearing to the house of  Sylvestre et Cie. here&mdash; where I am at present domiciled&mdash;try and imagine,  capitano mio, your once reckless and roving Philip scribbling for a bare  livelihood, seated at a respectable table, upon the respectable three-legged  stool of commerce&mdash;amongst many other things, a sum of ten thousand pounds, all  in golden sovereigns (I can almost hear their jingle as I write).</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My  information is sure, and you can rely upon it with certainty. I don&rsquo;t know why  the treasure wasn&rsquo;t sent out in the usual way&mdash;namely, by the mail steamer, which  arrives at least a month before you. May I not put it thus, now that you have  read so far? Perhaps in these troublous times they fancy a sailing vessel the  safest means of conveyance, and the <i>Marathon</i> was pitched upon, not only because she carries a large freight for our  heterogeneous establishment &mdash; half bank, half wholesale warehouse&mdash; but because  old Marsh, her captain, is a personal friend of Sylvestre&rsquo;s.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Having  overhauled our cashiers private memo book, I can tell you that the gold is to  be packed in two small cases, each containing five thousand pounds, and both  enclosed in a larger one.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As  to where the precious consignment is to be placed, I have not, alas, been able  to ascertain particulars. But you may almost to a certainty reckon on its being  in either the captain&rsquo;s or chief officers berth.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You  say Tony is with you yet, and that a lot of the old <i>Campeador&rsquo;s</i> crew are knocking about London. I would, however, in this venture  trust rather to stratagem than strength. Still, if you find it impossible to  get a berth on the <i>Marathon</i>,  you might take a passage in her and induce some of your old hands to ship  before the mast. Of course, the rest would then be easy&mdash;with the drawback of  too many partners.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;So  certain am I that you will find a way of making a principal in this enterprise,  that next month I shall leave here and go to Jabez Freeman&rsquo;s&mdash; you remember the  old Yankee-Dutchman who went halves in our coolie venture &mdash; he has left  Sourabaya, and now lives in Acheen. Let his place be our rendezvous. Leave the <i>Marathon</i>, if  all goes well, at or just before you arrive at Anjer. Once within the straits,  your chances will be small. If you could but get the command! But that is  almost too much to hope for. Addios; that favouring breezes may blow you safely  eastward is the prayer of your old comrade and fellow-adventurer,</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip  Garcia&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  say that Selby was staggered on reading and fully realising the meaning of this  letter would be but poorly to express his sensations.</p>
<p>But  he was, although young, possessed of uncommon strength of character and  presence of mind; so, pulling himself together, he glanced involuntarily  towards the cabin hatchway, and in another minute, stepping over, deposited the  paper exactly where he had first discovered it. Then, running down on to the  main deck, he shouted the order, &ldquo;Port forebraces!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After  the usual sleepy bustle incidental to checking the yards had subsided, he  slowly returned aft. As he passed the coop he saw that the paper had  disappeared. Strolling over to the binnacle, he asked the helmsman carelessly  if the captain had been on deck. &ldquo;Only for a minute, sir,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  just gone below again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young officer&rsquo;s thoughts, as he impatiently waited for his watch to expire,  were not of the pleasantest, but they were to some purpose. In place of turning  in when at length his relief arrived, his first act was to extinguish the lamp  in the saloon, lighting, instead, a small taper, by whose flickering aid he  attentively surveyed the mizzenmast</p>
<p>That  spar, from deck to floor of the saloon, was panelled in mahogany. The four  sides of this panelling were ornamented in relief with carved bunches of  tropical fruits, amongst which Selby&rsquo;s fingers moved for a moment with the  uncertain motion of one seeking for something long forgotten and lost sight of.  At length, as the perplexed frown on his features grew deeper and deeper, he  happened to press a tiny banana, a loud click was heard, and about a foot  square of the panelling slid smoothly out, disclosing to view the yellow painted  ironwork of the mast. Inserting his arm in the aperture and pressing a small  button, a neat locker, constructed in the very hollow of the mast itself, and  fitted with two shelves, appeared, as a section of the massive cylinder  revolved noiselessly on some unseen pivot.</p>
<p>A  few minutes later, and after a trip to his berth, only a step or two away,  giving a final look around and seeing nothing but the dim vista of the long  saloon&mdash; hearing nothing but the stertorous breathing of a passenger, answered  at intervals by a loud snore from the steward&mdash; he, with a sigh of satisfaction,  rolled into his bunk, ejaculating under his breath the seemingly irrelevant, if  not altogether immoral prayer, &ldquo;Thank Heaven for the opium trade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  next morning, under pretext of examining the fresh-water tanks, Selby took the  carpenter, an old Scotchman, whom he had known almost from boyhood, down into  the forehold, and there, in the obscurity amongst the cargo, told him the state  of affairs&mdash;what he knew and what he only guessed at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course, Mac,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;you heard of the attack on our old skipper&mdash;no  secret was made of it after we left Plymouth&mdash;well,  it&rsquo;s my opinion that he was waylaid by some of the gang of whom we have at  least two on board. There may be more of them amongst the crew. Anyhow, the  money&rsquo;s safe, I think.</p>
<p>I stowed  it away in the mizzen locker that you remember poor old Marsh got those French  locksmiths to make in Foochow, to enable him  to do a bit of opium smuggling now and again. He let me into the secret of the  spring during the first voyage; but I never thought the thing would come in as  handy as it did last night. And now, Chips, I want you to help me circumvent  this pair of rascals who have managed to get a footing amongst us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  wi&rsquo; ye, sir,&rdquo; answered the carpenter, who had listened with only an  interjection here and there. &ldquo;But hadna we better pit thae twa pirates in irons  at once? The crew &lsquo;ll stan&rsquo; by ye, sir, to a mon; as I doubtna will the second  mate an&rsquo; the bo&rsquo;sun &mdash;though they&rsquo;re but strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know so much about that, Chips,&rdquo; replied Selby dubiously. &ldquo;They all have  a capital opinion of Hanlon. Besides, as I mentioned before, how can we be sure  that he has no confederates amongst them? You see, too, that I&rsquo;ve let all proof  go out of my hands. No, no, I have a scheme carefully thought out. All I want  is your help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  that ye can depend on, sir,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m real glad ye thocht o&rsquo; the  bit kist in the mizzen, yonder. I would never ha&rsquo; minded on it mysel&rsquo;; its sae  lang sin&rsquo; I last clappit eyes on the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently,  giving the carpenter his instructions clearly and concisely, the chief officer  rose to go on deck, adding, &ldquo;Now mind, Chips, if anybody wants to know what you  are doing, say you&rsquo;re only putting in a couple of props under the quarter-deck,  which is springing a bit. You can place your bench down the after-hatch as  close as you can get to the lazarette grating. Luckily for us, she&rsquo;s not a full  ship. No one will interfere with you there. Above all, be cautious and sure; and  remember not to spare the solder, as they can&rsquo;t be too strong, and scarcely too  heavy. Now get to work at once, for we have not a minute to spare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  night or two after the conversation narrated above, the Master and his  passenger were sitting alone in the former&rsquo;s room. A decanter of whisky and  glasses stood on a table between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Tony,&rdquo; the Master was saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve rummaged over all Marsh&rsquo;s papers, and the  ship&rsquo;s too, but not a line can I find to give us a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,  it can&rsquo;t never be stowed amongst the cargo,&rdquo; replied Mr. Antony Brennan, after  a pause. &ldquo;An&rsquo; yet,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I ransacked both mates&rsquo; berths last night.  Nothin&rsquo; was locked; an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go bail there ain&rsquo;t five pounds cash atween the  pair on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil  Garcia&rsquo;s given us a hard nut to crack this time; and I wish, almost, that I had  brought some of the <i>Campeador</i> boys  with us! There were enough left of them to have turned this old dug-out upside  down. But it would have been a difficult matter, with her crowd already on  board. It <i>must</i> be hidden somewhere  close to,&rdquo; went on the Master thoughtfully. &ldquo;They would never be so mad as to  stow specie amongst the cargo, where, in case of accident, it might be  impossible to get at it. No! I&rsquo;ll wager anything that it&rsquo;s not far away from  where we are now sitting&mdash; that is, if it&rsquo;s on board at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  the owners never tould ye a word, captain?&rdquo; asked Brennan presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  did not,&rdquo; replied the greater rogue, with a frown. &ldquo;But I am pretty certain  that Selby knows all about it; and, if our searching fails, I&rsquo;ll try and get  the secret out of him &mdash; by fair means if possible&mdash; if not, then by others. I  shouldn&rsquo;t like to have to hurt him, for he&rsquo;s a smart lad, and there&rsquo;s damage  enough been done already in that line. But, of course &rdquo;&mdash; and here the Master  emptied his glass with the sigh of a man who has, more than once, found himself  a martyr to disagreeable alternatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t love a bone in the stuck-up whelp&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; growled Brennan. &ldquo;He gives me  a squint now an&rsquo; again out o&rsquo; the corner o&rsquo; his eye as makes me half-think he  smells a rat! Anyway, from this out I means to keep my lamps trimmed for his  benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  replied the Master calmly. &ldquo;The only way he could have learnt anything would  have been by getting hold of that confounded letter of Phil&rsquo;s I dropped. It was  barely ten minutes out of my hands; and, as I told you, when I came up on deck  again for it, he was away for&rsquo;ard at the braces; so must have left the poop  almost at the same moment as ourselves. And, Tony, don&rsquo;t let me see you so much  amongst the men. Your language is deteriorating sadly. Soon the mercantile  varnish of Mr. Antony Brennan, East India merchant and trader, that I laboured  so unceasingly to lay on, will wear off, and you will stand confessed before  all hands as the old barnacle you are, half packet-rat, half pirate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These  wind-jammers are so cursed slow after the <i>Campeador&rsquo;s</i> screw,&rdquo; murmured the other sulkily, &ldquo;that a fellow don&rsquo;t know half his time  what to be at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; was the Master&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;be careful, or you&rsquo;ll have Selby smelling a rat  in earnest if you come out with your sea-lingo the way you did at dinner this  evening. What are you going to do to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  for overhaulin&rsquo; that cargo in the spare berth,&rdquo; said Brennan; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s mostly  cases in there, an&rsquo; the stuff may be cached amongst &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  may,&rdquo; assented the Master, &ldquo;but if I had not felt certain that it would have  been in either the mate&rsquo;s or the captain&rsquo;s room, I would have had nothing to do  with the venture. However, fortune may still continue to smile upon us. It was  an extraordinary piece of good luck in the first place, my getting the  command&mdash;an utter stranger, with only Spanish and American papers to show, and  most of them forged for the occasion! So, courage, my Tony, and, as the Scotch  say, let us keep &lsquo;a stout heart to a stey brae!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>II</b></h3>
<p>Meanwhile  the <i>Marathon</i> sped along her ocean course, and outwardly, at least, everything appeared to go  on with the patient regularity of average merchantman discipline.</p>
<p>Hanlon  himself was, as a rule, most companionable and agreeable. He could talk well and  fluently on many subjects, and possessed also a very sweet tenor voice, to  which he often accompanied himself on the piano that Captain Marsh had put on  board for the use of his wife, who, at intervals, made a voyage with him. And  Selby, as he listened sometimes to this tuneful sea-bird of prey warbling  amatory ballads and sentimental fancies in a style that brought the watch below  out of their bunks, and all hands as close aft as they dared venture, or  discoursing eloquently on all kinds of things, from the variation of the  magnetic needle to agnosticism, would, at such moments, almost imagine he must  have been dreaming on the night that he picked up and read the damning epistle  whose every word seemed indelibly stamped on his memory.</p>
<p>Yet,  now and again, the young fellow, rendered doubly observant and wary by a sense  of hidden peril, thought he caught a glimpse of a lurking devil in the Master&rsquo;s  eye giving ample promise of an inner man beneath that careless, debonair  exterior, to cross whose path might be hazardous indeed.</p>
<p>A  few days before expecting to make the land, the Master sent for his chief  officer to attend him in his cabin. Selby found the former seated before a mass  of papers which he was turning over with a worried air. &ldquo;Take a seat, Mr.  Selby,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I sent for you to see if you can help a bad memory. As Mr.  Manifest&mdash;the senior partner, you know&mdash; and myself were coming off that morning  at Gravesend, he mentioned something about a consignment of specie which their  firm was making by the <i>Marathon</i> to  that of Sylvestre and Co., the French brokers and agents in Singapore. I know  he gave me some details; but, to tell you truth, I didn&rsquo;t pay much attention to  them, imagining that I should surely find a memorandum of the amount, stowage,  etc., amongst the ship&rsquo;s papers for the benefit of the consignees. However, I  can find nothing of the kind. Can you&rdquo;&mdash; and here the Master&rsquo;s eyes, of  cold-looking, steely blue, sought Selby&rsquo;s with that expression in them that the  latter had before noticed,&mdash; &ldquo;can you,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;help me out of this  dilemma? It won&rsquo;t be very pleasant for old Sylvestre to come for his dollars  and be told we don&rsquo;t know where they are, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  chief officer had long been expecting a crisis like the present, so answered  promptly and readily. &ldquo;Oh yes, Captain Hanlon, I think I can tell you all you  wish to know. I assisted myself to stow the gold away in the lazarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,  curious place to carry treasure, Mr. Selby,&rdquo; said the Master, without moving a  muscle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain  Marsh&rsquo;s idea, sir,&rdquo; answered Selby. &ldquo;He did not, somehow, like having it in his  cabin. I fancy he thought its presence there would remind him too constantly of  the responsibility attached to the safe-keeping of so much money. Ten thousand  pounds, sir, is a large sum, and Captain Marsh was very peculiar in some  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is indeed,&rdquo; replied the other absently, unmindful of Selby&rsquo;s last remark. &ldquo;Far  too large to be stowed in such a place. Why, the steward or one of the men  might stumble upon it any minute. And&mdash;well, sailors are but human, you know,  Mr. Selby! Get the box or whatever it is into the spare berth next to my own  to-morrow. I am not afraid of any overstrained sense of responsibility  rendering <i>my</i> sleep uneasy&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, sir,&rdquo; answered Selby. &ldquo;There is but a single case, containing a couple of  smaller ones, each holding five thousand sovereigns, and each covered with tin  and tightly soldered down &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  seem well up in the details, sir,&rdquo; remarked the Master, with a quick look of  suspicion, which, however, as instantly disappeared when Selby replied simply,  &ldquo;I ought to be, sir, for I helped Mr. Manifest and Captain Marsh to carry the  gold from the cab into this very room. It took us the whole afternoon, I  remember, to pack and put it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Mr. Selby,&rdquo; said the Master graciously. &ldquo;I am very much obliged to you,  indeed;&rdquo; and Selby, breathing more freely than he had done for the past twenty  minutes, went on deck, muttering in his inmost soul a fervent prayer that a  miserable spirit of inquisitiveness might not at the last minute ruin  everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tony,&rdquo;  whispered the Master as, an hour afterwards, he looked into that worthy&rsquo;s  berth, &ldquo;we have been a pair of asses to go poking about, addling our brains and  spoiling our clothes, when a simple question or two would have settled  everything. You can pack up now, as soon as you like, for Acheen and Jabez  Freeman&rsquo;s. I wish, by the bye, that Garcia had chosen some other rendezvous;  for the monkey-faced old scamp swore that I cheated him out of a thousand  gulden in our last little speculation together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  the morning, with the assistance of Selby and the carpenter&mdash;whose grim,  wrinkled face wore an expression of almost unnatural solemnity&mdash;a small but  weighty box was disinterred from its undignified quarters, amongst a mass of  provision casks, to the spare berth, where, a few minutes later, might have  been observed the East India merchant, cold chisel and hammer in hand,  cautiously inserting, lifting, and wrenching till the top came off, exposing a  packing of sawdust. Groping amongst this, he, with some exertion, brought to  light what looked and felt like a case of solid block-tin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful  small ye are, an&rsquo; no mistake, soliloquised the rascal, as he stared at it with  covetous eyes, &ldquo;to be houlding so much of the stuff that makes the mare to go!  An&rsquo; where&rsquo;s your brother, my little darlin&rsquo;? Oh, it&rsquo;s here ye are, is it?&rdquo; he  continued, as his fingers came in contact with the other case. &ldquo;Well, I guess y&rsquo;  are a swate pair o&rsquo; twins. I reckon, though, it&rsquo;s some getting out o&rsquo; your  shells ye&rsquo;ll take, my beauties; an&rsquo; I believe we&rsquo;ll leave that part o&rsquo; the  performance till we find ourselves clear o&rsquo; the ship an&rsquo; her stuck-up gentleman  of a mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anjer  Point at last, and the <i>Marathon</i> at anchor, and her decks crowded by Javanese, all wanting to dispose of  something, from a bunch of bananas to a suit of duck clothing. &ldquo;We shall stay  here for a day or so, Mr. Selby,&rdquo; the Master had said, &ldquo;and you can let the  starboard watch ashore on liberty. The port one can go to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was an unprecedented arrangement, as was also detaining the vessel at a place  where a stoppage of only a few hours is customary with craft bound through into  the Eastern seas.</p>
<p>However,  the chief officer made no objection, nor did he when Hanlon added, &ldquo;Oh, and you&rsquo;d  better get the lifeboat into the water. I&rsquo;ll take Mr. Brennan for a sail  tomorrow, as it&rsquo;s Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On  Sunday night the port watch was still in the enjoyment of its &ldquo;liberty&rdquo;; whilst  the men of the starboard one were in their bunks, sleeping off the effects of  the schnapps and rum they had so plentifully imbibed.</p>
<p>The  carpenter, by Selby&rsquo;s orders, was keeping the anchor watch; and the latter,  having intimated his intention of going ashore and rousing up the absentees,  had been seen by the Master and his companion&mdash;just returned from their  cruise&mdash;to jump into a native canoe and be pulled rapidly townwards.</p>
<p>In  reality, however, having come hand over hand up the cable, he was then in his  berth, whose open port commanded a view of the lifeboat as she lay with her  mast stepped just astern.</p>
<p>Four  bells had struck for&rsquo;ard, when he, still vigilantly on the alert, heard the  boat being gently drawn up alongside. It was too dark to make out anything  distinctly, but he could hear someone cautiously descending the gang-way-ladder,  and catch the sound of a muttered conversation.</p>
<p>There  was not a soul on deck except the carpenter, who was ostentatiously whistling  on the forecastle-head. Presently, what the listener took to be a portmanteau  dropped with a thud on the thwarts. There was a sharp oath or two, and again  all was quiet. Ten minutes more of suspense, and there came to his ears the  &ldquo;cheep&rdquo; of the halliards as the sail was being hoisted; and he could see it,  like a thicker patch of darkness, heading slowly through the night for the open  sea. The <i>Marathon</i> had lost her Master and her passenger.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are quite sure, Philip, that Hanlon managed to get charge of this treasure-ship  you talk so much about?&rdquo; asked Jabez Freeman for the second or third time of  his companion, as the pair sat one moonlight night in the spacious verandah of  the old trader&rsquo;s house on the outskirts of the town of Acheen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I am, I tell you,&rdquo; replied Garcia, a tall, sallow-looking Creole with a  villainous squint. &ldquo;How on earth he contrived it I don&rsquo;t know, but the news  came by mail, just before I cleared out from that infernal counting-house of  Sylvestre&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hei!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the other, &ldquo;it will be a  very pretty little haul, if it only comes off. But that fellow Hanlon is a devil!  He is too clever! He should think now and again on the proverb that my very  good friends and countrymen here are so fond of repeating, &lsquo;<i>De kruik gaat zoo lang te water dat zij  breekt</i>,&rsquo; so often goes the pitcher to the water that at last it breaks&mdash;crick!  crack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  the deuce with your proverbs!&rdquo; was the rude answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve become a regular  croaker of late. I suppose you&rsquo;re thinking about that thousand gulden you say  Hanlon did you out of, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  old man&rsquo;s eyes gleamed as he asked, &ldquo;What share do you expect, Philip, for the  information you gave about this affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  third,&rdquo; promptly replied Garcia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  reasonable indeed. And I am expected to sit quietly by and see myself swindled,  Mr. Philip!&rdquo; said Freeman, with a sneer. &ldquo;No, that won&rsquo;t do. I tell you I must  have a thousand of those beautiful, newly-minted sovereigns that you go into  such ecstasies about, or I will make Sumatra  too hot to hold you! Remember, Mr. Garcia, that I am now a naturalised  Dutchman, and have traded in their colonies for the last ten years. My name  carries with it an influence you little wot of, and my standing is too well  known and respected to be compromised by a gang of saltwater rats like yours.  For old times&rsquo; sake, I said to myself, on receiving your letter, that I would give  the three of you shelter here as my guests so long as you pleased to stay. But  I must be paid, Master Phil, I must be paid!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dutch  gunboats, my friend,&rdquo; went on the old fellow, laughing maliciously, &ldquo;are even  now in the harbour, filled with troops from Batavia. In the interior is no refuge, for  the Acheenese are in open rebellion. So, you see that strangers, without the  shelter of some well-known name and influence, are like to have an evil time of  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  speaker was a little, shrivelled-up specimen of humanity, with a skin so  resembling old parchment in its colour and wrinkles, that every time he opened  his mouth one almost involuntarily listened in the expectation of hearing the  skin crackle. A grey beard fell on to his breast. His eyebrows, though, were  yet as black as jet, and from beneath their bushy shelter a pair of small,  piercing orbs of the same hue shone angrily, and the long beard wagged to and  fro, giving a vicious sort of emphasis to his speech, as he suddenly arose and  confronted his companion, who sat silent and sulky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  it a bargain?&rdquo; continued old Jabez, &ldquo;or must I send word to my good friend and  brother-magistrate, Meester van Houten, in the town below, that a pair of  sea-pirates are about to land here with money stolen from an English ship? My  thousand pounds&rsquo; share! or <i>zoo waarlijk  helpe mij God</i>, Philip, I will do as I have said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are hard on us, Jacob,&rdquo; said Garcia, turning sallower than ever. &ldquo;But I  suppose, as you hold too many trumps, there&rsquo;s nothing else for it. So far as I  am concerned you shall have your thousand&mdash;though I don&rsquo;t know what Hanlon will  think of an old friend&rsquo;s selling the shelter of his house and name in that way.  It is surely time they were here, if they mean coming at all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanlon!  The <i>schelm!</i> He cheated me out of my  gulden&rdquo;&mdash; the old man was beginning angrily, when a long, low whistle came to  their ears from a clump of rhododendrons at the foot of the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  they are, at the old landing-place!&rdquo; exclaimed Garcia eagerly, as he answered  the signal by a similar one; and presently two figures advanced out of the  shadows into the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  everything right?&rdquo; asked the Creole, as he hurried forward to meet the  new-comers, followed more slowly by Freeman. &ldquo;All safe and square, I am happy  to say,&rdquo; replied the ex-Master of the <i>Marathon</i> as, with his faithful henchman, Tony, he  stepped on to the verandah. &ldquo;A regular picnic from beginning to end&mdash;in fact,  the best and easiest job I ever had in my life. Too easy, indeed! You&rsquo;d better  come down to the boat and help us up with the &lsquo;twins,&rsquo; as Tony, here, calls  them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  precious cases were soon carried to the house and deposited in a corner of the  room under a battery of admiring and loving glances from the quartette&mdash;for old  Freeman, at sight of them, appeared quite as excited as the others.</p>
<p>Presently  the host announced dinner, and after the Malay servants had disappeared,  Hanlon, as the decanters passed around, told the story of the capture to an  admiring and enthusiastic audience. Then Garcia explained Freeman&rsquo;s claim, at  which the two principals, and especially Tony, looked for a minute glum enough.  But Hanlon, perceiving the necessity for giving way gracefully, replied, &ldquo;Certainly,  Jabez is entitled to his thousand. We will make it up each one of us from his  share,&rdquo; whispering the next instant to Garcia, who sat close to him, &ldquo;Never  mind, Phil, we&rsquo;ll have double that much out of the old miser; and his skin too,  before we leave here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,  captain,&rdquo; said Jabez, who had observed the muttered aside. &ldquo;I thought we should  come to an understanding when you knew how affairs stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo;  now,&rdquo; put in Tony, &ldquo;as all is peaceably settled, I guess we might have a look  at the shiners! I wanted to crack the nuts on the way up from Anjer, but the  captain, there, wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. &lsquo;Wait,&rsquo; sez he, &lsquo;till we get safe to our  old friend&rsquo;s place, where we can do it in comfort.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>One  ot the tin cases was now brought forward, and Freeman supplying the necessary  tools, after an amount of labour which made Tony and Garcia perspire, the  sheathing was at length wrenched off.</p>
<p>Then,  whilst the pair washed their hands, which, in their eagerness, they had cut  with the edges of the tin, Hanlon lifted the wooden box on to the table and  prepared to take the lid off.</p>
<p>With  some difficulty this was done, and a packing of sawdust displayed. It was a  moment of delicious expectation to the rest, who gathered more closely around,  their faces lit up with an ecstasy of impatient greed, and their hands  outstretched towards the precious booty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady  now!&rdquo; exclaimed Hanlon, who was calmest of all, as he proceeded to remove the  sawdust. &ldquo;Keep your fingers off, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly  he grew pale, and with an oath expressive of dismay and wonder, completely  overturned the box, out of which, with a crash, tumbled on to the polished  table a heap of iron washers, bolts, nuts, and nails, showing darkly under the  soft lamplight.</p>
<p>For  the space of fully two minutes there was a silence so intense that the shrill  chirping of the cicadas in the grass just outside sounded like the laughter  loud and satirical of a great crowd to the ears of the four men, who, with  faces over which it seemed as if some mighty hand had suddenly drawn a mask  stamped with the one passion of baffled avarice, steadfastly gazed at the heap  of base metal which mocked so unfeelingly their eager anticipation of a moment  before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try  the other one!&rdquo; at length said Hanlon, his features working with excitement. It  was broken open, and with a like result.</p>
<p>And  now the ex-Master of the <i>Marathon</i> completely lost that bearing of dignified  self-control which was wont to give him such authority over his fellow-rascals,  and bitterly accused Garcia, who stood eyeing the worthless rubbish before him  as if petrified&mdash;of having supplied him with inaccurate information, for, even  yet, he did not suspect Selby&rsquo;s share in the deception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said old Freeman, pushing between them, as Hanlon, half choked with passion,  strode towards the Creole,&mdash; &ldquo;nonsense, captain, I wonder at your stupidity!  Phil, as far as he went, was square enough. Depend upon it, you were duped on  board the <i>Marathon</i>!  I haven&rsquo;t a doubt that the real cases containing the specie were on the vessel  all the time, and that, at last, clever as you think yourself, you met your  match. The plain fact of the matter is, that you&rsquo;ve been most ingeniously sold,  by whom you should know best. However, you can&rsquo;t stay here, that&rsquo;s certain.  Luckily for you all, you&rsquo;ve got a good seaboat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  stay here?&rdquo; repeated the three in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  returned old Jabez, chuckling with a grin of intense delight at the  consternation expressed in their faces. &ldquo;The Dutch Governor&rsquo;s orders are that  all strangers be at once expelled, or imprisoned till the rebellion is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  as your friends?&rdquo; queried Hanlon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo;  was the answer, &ldquo;that, certainly, might make a difference. But then, you see,  captain&mdash;my thousand pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  old scoundrel!&rdquo; shouted Hanlon furiously, as his hand sought his breast-pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  shooting, <i>schelm</i> of a captain!&rdquo;  almost screamed the old man, as, pressing a button in the wall close to where  he stood, a bell sounded long and shrilly through the place&mdash;&ldquo; <i>God zij gedankt</i> (God be praised), I know  your little tricks of foregone times! Put up your pistol, or my servants shall  cut you all to pieces and cast them to the swine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even  whilst he spoke, and as if in answer to a well-understood signal, the long  verandah suddenly filled with dark forms, and the moonbeams glinted ominously  on a score of naked creeses.</p>
<p>Seeing  the futility of attempting to force a welcome on such a host as stood there  pointing threateningly towards him, his beard wagging tremulously with anger  and excitement, his beady black eyes gleaming with fear and malice, as he  rapidly spoke a few words to the fierce-looking Malays, who now crowded into  the room, Hanlon, after a minute&rsquo;s deep thought, and a glance around such as a  wolf at bay might give, led the way, silently followed by his companions, to  their boat. And, presently, as old Freeman, surrounded by his guard, saw the  sail being slowly hoisted, a dark patch against the setting moon, he muttered  angrily to himself as he returned to the house&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Scheer u weg!</i> To the deuce with you,  Hanlon! <i>Hei!</i> That&rsquo;s for my thousand  gulden you cheated me of! Once too often, my clever captain, have you carried  your pitcher to the water! <i>Hei!</i> What  did I tell that yellow scamp!&rdquo;</p>

<h3 align="center"><b>Chapter 1<br>
  Agent And Interpreter</b></h3>
<p>The  Queensland  planters wanted their sugar-cane cut. Whites couldn&rsquo;t, or wouldn&rsquo;t stand the  work all day long, out in the fields under the broiling sun, and so the cry&mdash;  kept down for a year or two, since the exposure of the cruel &ldquo;blackbirding&rdquo;  traffic&mdash;for a supply of coloured labour&mdash;legalised, if needs be, by the most  stringent legislation, but to be procured at any cost&mdash;was heard once more.  This, then, was the reason why, one bright summer&rsquo;s morning in December, openly  and fairly, without, as of yore, attempt at disguise or false clearance, that  well-known island trader, the <i>Schoolboy</i> schooner, set off from Moreton Bay on her search for voluntary help amongst the  inhabitants, black and tawny, of the Southern Seas&mdash;&ldquo;boys&rdquo; who would consent to  bind themselves for a term of years to cut the planter&rsquo;s cane, and work on his  plantation, receiving a small sum yearly for their services, and at the end of  their time, if they so wished it, to be faithfully returned to the very same  spot from which they had been taken.</p>
<p>In  both Houses, Assembly and Council, at the time of which I write, the planter  interest was paramount, and a bill had been hurriedly passed, authorising  certain vessels&mdash;the <i>Schoolboy</i> being  one&mdash;which had to carry a Government agent, to cruise for &ldquo;labour&rdquo; in the South  Seas.</p>
<p>Not  the slightest compulsion was to be used. Promises, presents, and fair offers  might be used, but there was to be no &ldquo;blackbird-catching,&rdquo; kidnapping, or &ldquo;wool-money&rdquo;  to the crew as of old. Everything was to be done this time with strict  fairness.</p>
<p>Old  John Adams, the skipper, heartily anathematising the agent, and the whole of the  new-fangled state of affairs, was, nevertheless, obliged to acquiesce, or to  give up the command of his beloved schooner, and to see the beautiful stands of  Remington and Snider rifles, boarding-pikes, cutlasses, etc., ruthlessly  unshipped and taken ashore. The only three armed men on board were the captain,  the agent, and myself as chief officer, who were, by the regulations of the  firm who now owned the schooner, allowed to carry one revolver apiece. These  precautions were taken with a view to prevent another wholesale slaughter of  natives like-that which had recently happened on board the brig <i>Charles</i>; but the old captain averred  that we should all bitterly rue them before the end of the trip.</p>
<p>The <i>Schoolboy</i> was long and narrow, built  evidently more for speed than comfort, and how two hundred &ldquo;blackbirds&rdquo; could  ever have been stowed away in her &rsquo;tween decks, as I was assured had often been  the case, passed my comprehension. Eighty was to be our complement this time,  should we be so fortunate as to obtain that number on the &ldquo;moral suasion&rdquo; principle,  and convenient and comfortable fittings had been erected for their  accommodation below.</p>
<p>Our  registered tonnage was one hundred and twenty, and we carried nine seamen; five  of these, however, were Kanakas, the captain having found it difficult to get  white men to ship, sailors then in port seeming to fight shy of the vessels  sailing under the new Act.</p>
<p>The  agent, Mr. Agnew, had almost unlimited power in the direction of affairs, and  old Captain Adams, to his unconcealed dissatisfaction, felt himself quite a  secondary personage on board, subject as he was to the whims and caprices of  the Government man, who, in this instance, happened to be totally unsuited to  the position. He was an inexperienced young man, from, I think, the Lands  Department, and of an irritable and snappish disposition, which rendered him  peculiarly useless for dealing with the treacherous, subtle savages of the  Solomon Archipelago, amongst the islands of which group we were chiefly to  recruit.</p>
<p>Our  interpreter was a native of New Britain, and was also an object of special  dislike to the captain, who had known him for some years, and who averred that  nearly every vessel in which Jacob had filled the same position as that he now  held, had been unfortunate in being attacked by the islanders, losing either  men or boats, or sometimes both, to say nothing of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; taken ashore to  tempt recruits.</p>
<p>Jacob,  who had been appointed by the agent, was a big, sinister-looking rascal, and I  recognised him at once as the heaviest swell amongst those Kanakas who on  tropical Queensland evenings are wont to parade up and down, &ldquo;doing&rdquo; Queen  Street, got up in all the glory of white duck patrol-coat, black doeskin  trousers, stovepipe hat, white collar, and flaming necktie, their great naked  feet sprawling upon the pavement as they swagger about in groups.</p>
<p>That  glorious raiment was for the present, however, safely stowed away in Jacob&rsquo;s  chest, and he appeared clad now in a modest suit of dungaree, seeming anything  but overjoyed at leaving the delights of the Queensland capital. However, as the days  wore on, he brightened up considerably, and asked so many questions of the  captain as to the amount of &ldquo;trade&rdquo; on board, and of what articles it chiefly  consisted, that at length the old man lost all patience and bade him mind his  own business, or go ask the agent, his master.</p>
<p>That  gentleman, hearing the squabble, and gratified at being able, as he thought, to  snub the captain, most unwisely did tell Jacob what most of the trade, stowed  away in the great deal cases, consisted of; and I thought I saw the interpreter&rsquo;s  eyes sparkle as the various goods were named &mdash; tomahawks and axes, calico,  cotton prints, nails, knives, looking-glasses, pipes, tobacco, and other  articles&mdash;as auctioneers set forth in their announcements&mdash; &ldquo;too numerous to  mention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob  Ink, to give him his full name, was a long way above the general run of  islanders, for he could read and write, besides speaking English better, I  think, than any darkey I ever met. He had been taken in hand when pretty young  by some one or other of the numerous missionaries; the only effect of whose  teaching, however, had been to endow a naturally cunning and treacherous  disposition with all the more aptitude to carry out any scheme of rascality  which it might please him to concoct.</p>
<p>To  this man the agent seemed to have taken a great fancy, whether simply to spite  the captain, who hated the sight of him, or from a real belief in his ability,  and the influence which he was never tired of boasting that he possessed over  the islanders, I know not; but it was certainly through Agnew&rsquo;s influence that  Jacob, instead of messing with the other Kanakas, who occupied a small  deck-house amidships, was allowed to take up his quarters aft, in a spare berth  adjoining the agent&rsquo;s own, and to have his meals given to him from the  cabin-table.</p>
<p>For  some time the passage down was devoid of anything of peculiar interest, and the  continual bickering going on aft made it awkward for everyone, and seemed to  foreshadow an uncomfortable voyage. The agent wished to make for Santa Cruz, this being one  of the islands at which Jacob&rsquo;s influence&mdash;according to himself&mdash;was  all-powerful; but the captain, for some reason of his own, persistently  declined to call there.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Chapter 2<br>
  Two &ldquo;Little Larks &rdquo;</b></h3>
<p>Our  old skipper&rsquo;s dislike of the agent and his familiar was, especially as regarded  the latter, fully shared in by the crew, white and coloured. One stifling hot  day, the schooner hardly moving through the water, Jacob had gone overboard,  and was disporting himself like a black triton in what seemed to be his native  element, diving, till one would think he was going to stay under altogether,  turning somersaults, and indulging in all kinds of antics, when one of the men  suddenly sang out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say,  Mister Ink, there&rsquo;s your old father a-comin&rsquo; along. Mind he don&rsquo;t overhaul  you.&rdquo; Jacob, looking over his shoulder, saw the triangular danger-signal  cleaving its way through the glassy water towards him, and made a frantic  clutch at the rope&rsquo;s-end with which he had lowered himself down the side; but  the laughing sailor drew it up tantalisingly just out of his reach, whilst  Jacob, his face turning an ugly grey colour, made convulsive attempts to grasp  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  shame, Stevens!&rdquo; I called out, happening just then to catch sight of the  affair. &ldquo;Throw him the rope at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only  havin&rsquo; a little lark with Mr. Ink, sir,&rdquo; replied the man as he obeyed; and  Jacob scrambled on deck, exhausted, as the shark dashed up, hitting the  schooner&rsquo;s side such a bang that I almost thought one of her planks must have  started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  call that a little lark&mdash;eh?&rdquo; remarked Jacob to the man as soon as he recovered  his breath. &ldquo;All right; p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps some day you see my little lark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  fellow only laughed, and the rest of the hands enjoyed the joke hugely, none  the less, perhaps, because of Agnew&rsquo;s exclaiming that had the shark but put a  scratch on Jacob he would have had Stevens &ldquo;lagged,&rdquo; the skipper maintaining,  on the other hand, that it was a great pity that the rope had not been kept up  altogether, expressing at the same time his thorough belief in the theory of  relationship as propounded by Stevens, with the addendum that the &ldquo;nigger was  worse, if anything, than his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>About  a week after the above occurrence we saw, rising up ahead like a mound of emerald-hued  plumes, the island   of Mallicolo. In a few  hours we were abreast of the harbour, which is on the north-east side, with  deep water close inshore.</p>
<p>Here,  none of the natives, as is their general custom, coming off to us, a boat&rsquo;s  crew was sent ashore for fresh meat, fruit, etc., and to see if there was any  chance of procuring &ldquo;recruits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Griffiths,  the second mate, Agnew, Jacob, Stevens, and two of the Kanaka seamen composed  the party. They took the whaleboat, and the <i>Schoolboy</i> lay-to about a quarter of a mile off the shore.</p>
<p>I  gave Griffiths, who was a new hand amongst the islands, strict orders to allow  no natives in the boat, but to land the agent, interpreter, and one seaman, if  all seemed secure, and then to haul off about a couple of oar&rsquo;s-length from the  landing-place.</p>
<p>The  natives crowded down to the beach to meet our men, greeting them with every  manifestation of goodwill, and when asked why they had not come off as usual,  replied that for that day and the next one their canoes were <i>tabu</i>.</p>
<p>Jacob,  who was recognised by several as an old acquaintance, now made a speech, which  being duly replied to, he informed the agent that no recruits were to be had  just then, but provisions would be brought down for sale presently; and, sure  enough, in a few minutes the beach was covered with island produce, from a pig  to a cocoanut.</p>
<p>The  second mate, whom I had told to keep a sharp eye on Jacob, now handed &ldquo;trade&rdquo;  ashore to pay for the purchases, giving to the interpreter, amongst other  things, a tomahawk, for which, he said, Mr. Agnew had sent him.</p>
<p>Barter  proceeded quietly enough till the boat was nearly full of pork, poultry, and  fruit. Then the islanders brought forth &ldquo;curios&rdquo; in the shape of pieces of  tortoise-shell, the curious stones known as cats&rsquo;-eyes, and huge conches.</p>
<p>Mr.  Agnew, as most strangers do on their first trips, invested largely, and, with  Stevens, was examining a curiously-carved paddle, which the owner refused to  part with, when a native who carried a spear&mdash;the only armed man in the crowd,  so Griffiths, who was by this time also on shore, averred&mdash;tripped, and, being  apparently unable to help himself, fell, and, in falling, stuck the point of  his spear into Steven&rsquo;s leg, just below the knee.</p>
<p>It  was a mere scratch, the weapon not having penetrated up to the first barb; and,  when Stevens, who was at first inclined to be angry, saw the humble gestures of  apology made by the native, as he picked himself up, he thought no more about  it, especially as the man, after a short absence, returned and presented the  sailor with a fine sucking-pig; and then it was that the second mate noticed  that he carried, stuck in the cord which some of these islanders wear tied  tightly around their waist, a new tomahawk. It was not till afterwards that he  attached any significance to the fact&mdash; it merely crossed his mind that it must  be the same one Mr. Agnew had sent for, as it was the only instrument, out of  three similar ones in the boat, which had been used to pay the natives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just  a bit ov a accident, sir,&rdquo; said Stevens to me, as I noticed his leg bleeding  pretty freely, after he came on board; &ldquo;one o&rsquo; them Kanaks&mdash;clumsy beggar he  were, too&mdash;stuck his spear in a bit. I dessay it&rsquo;ll be all right again  to-morrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob,  holding in his hand a bunch of roots he had bought ashore, was standing close  by as the man spoke, and, apparently without the slightest cause, he burst into  a roar of laughter, making the while such hideous grimaces that the disgusted  seaman would have knocked him down had I not interfered and sent the  interpreter aft with a stern reprimand.</p>
<p>Stevens  was one of our best men&mdash;in fact, the best; and I did not feel altogether easy  as to the harmless nature of the scratch, simple as it looked, for when the  blood was washed away, the flesh round about seemed red and inflamed. I was  well acquainted with the fact that, on many of the islands, poisoned weapons  were used; but not the least suspicion of what I afterwards believed to be the  truth had as yet entered my mind.</p>
<p>That  evening Stevens complained of much pain, not only in the wounded leg, but all  over his body, and had to take to his bunk. After tea, I went for&rsquo;ard, and  found that his leg had swollen greatly, and that he was also very feverish.</p>
<p>The  captain, with whom he was a favourite, having been with him for some time, had  the sick man brought aft, where every attention possible with our limited means  was paid to him.</p>
<p>That  night, about twelve o&rsquo;clock, the whole vessel was alarmed by a terrible shout  from the berth in which the wounded sailor had been laid. Both watches were on  deck, and three or four of us entered the little cabin at the same time. A  floating wick, by its dim light, just enabled us to see Stevens sitting up,  deadly pale, and the perspiration pouring off him in streams. He had been a  little delirious during the first part of the night, but was now quite  sensible, and looking terribly bad; I could see, too, that his whole body was  beginning to swell.</p>
<p>He  told us that he had been dozing during a brief respite from pain, when suddenly  his wounded leg felt&mdash;so he expressed it&mdash;as if it had been thrust into a red-hot  furnace; and, opening his eyes and looking up, he had seen a fiend, in the  shape of Jacob Ink, leaning with all his weight on it. Directly Jacob, or Old  Nick, as Stevens would have it, perceived that the seaman was awake, he had put  his ugly face close to the sailor&rsquo;s and said, with a grin&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  little lark, Mister Stevens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  poor fellow, writhing with pain and fear, reiterated his belief that Jacob was  Old Nick in person, and said that when he shouted out in an agony of terror,  Jacob vanished in a moment.</p>
<p>Happening  just then to look around over the shoulders of those in the berth, I caught  sight of the interpreter, looking as cool as the proverbial cucumber.</p>
<p>Whispering  Griffiths to keep the darkey out of sight, I tried to reassure Stevens, and  shortly afterwards going on deck, I got hold of Agnew, and asked him if he  remembered giving Jacob orders to get a trade tomahawk from the second mate  whilst at Mallicolo. This he positively denied.</p>
<p>Jacob,  for whom I at once sent, as positively affirmed it to be true. The interpreter  indignantly denied also that he had been tormenting Stevens, remarking, with  that malicious grin of his&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  word! I do b&rsquo;lieve Mister Stevens gone right away cranky. He think me Ole Nick!  Ho, ho, ho!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Altogether,  beyond an almost certainty of foul play, I could make nothing satisfactory out  of the affair; but, with the captain&rsquo;s full sanction, I cautioned Master Jacob  that, should he be found out in any of his little games on board the <i>Schoolboy</i>, up he should go to the  fore-topsail-yardarm, with a running bow-line around his neck, were he twenty  interpreters rolled into one, and in spite of a dozen agents.</p>
<p>The  confident, self-satisfied smirk vanished from Jacob&rsquo;s face as I finished  speaking, for he saw I was very much indeed in earnest, and he turned his eyes  imploringly towards his master, as he considered Mr. Agnew; but that worthy,  himself being pretty well subdued by the passion with which I spoke, made no  attempt to defend his favourite, who I insisted should at once be relegated to  his proper place in the house on deck amongst the Kanaka seamen, one of whom, I  half hoped, as they mortally hated the sight of him, might rid the vessel of  our black incubus. My distrust of him, however, had by this time become so  great that, after a few days, finding he &ldquo;bossed&rdquo; his messmates till they were  ready to do his bidding like very slaves, I reinstated him in his old quarters  aft, preferring to have him under my own observation.</p>
<p>We  now called at several islands, and off the one known as the Duke of York&rsquo;s,  poor Stevens died raving, and apparently in great agony.</p>
<p>We  buried him the same night, and even the interpreter looked grave and impressed  as the burial rites proceeded. I stood close to him whilst Captain Adams read  the service, and had he so much as opened his lips or smiled, I fancy I should  have, there and then, put an end to his travels, had I not indeed been  anticipated by one of the dead man&rsquo;s three mates, who had drawn their own  conclusions as to the instigator of the &ldquo;accident&rdquo; at Mallicolo, and who cast  stern and gloomy looks at the interpreter, which probably helped in keeping his  high spirits to a decorous level on this occasion.</p>
<p>Of  &ldquo;labour&rdquo; we had, as yet, procured none &mdash;not a single &ldquo;boy&rdquo;&mdash;and the agent began  to speak slightingly of the interpreter, and to reproach him in no measured  terms for his vain boasting as regarded his recruiting capabilities.</p>
<p>The  captain, however, was rapidly exchanging his own and the owner&rsquo;s &ldquo;trade&rdquo; for a  very much more than fair equivalent in tortoise and pearl shell, sandal-wood,  &ldquo;curios,&rdquo; and other island valuables. He was, therefore, in a proportionably  good temper&mdash;inclined even to be sociable with his former <i>b&ecirc;te noire</i>, the agent, condoling with him on his non-success,  pointing out an island here, where he had, in those halcyon days gone by, got  fifty &ldquo;nigs&rdquo;; another over yonder, where, with the greatest ease, the sailors,  at half a crown a head as &ldquo;wool-money,&rdquo; had collared twenty, and, throwing them  into the boats, had pulled triumphantly on board.</p>
<p>At  one island, &ldquo;Api,&rdquo; I think he said, over one hundred &ldquo;head&rdquo; had been enticed  out of their canoes on to the schooner&rsquo;s deck; a volley of rifle-bullets poured  into the remainder of the flotilla, then every stitch of canvas set, the &ldquo;nigs&rdquo;  bundled head over heels into the hold, hatches clapped on and battened down; &ldquo;and,  almost before you could say &lsquo;knife,&rsquo; we were standing out to sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those  were the times, if you like. Yes, sir,&rdquo; the old skipper would generally add,  with a sly side-glance at the horrified agent, who would burst out with&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness  gracious me, Captain Adams, I can hardly trust my ears! Do you mean to sit  there and tell me that you were a party to these iniquities practised upon the  poor, innocent, harmless people of these islands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  the skipper would retort; &ldquo;you are pretty green yet, and no mistake! A lot of  crafty &lsquo;nigs,&rsquo; who would cut your throat while you were asleep, give &rsquo;em but  half a chance! Innocent, harmless! Ha, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Chapter 3<br>
  The &ldquo;Schoolboy&rdquo; Changes Hands</b></h3>
<p>The  weather, just about this time, became almost unbearably hot. Of wind there was  little or none, save catspaws, just ruffling the surface of the water, and for  two days the schooner could hardly be said to have steerage way on her.</p>
<p>The  glass, too, fell rapidly, but still the sky kept clear and blue by day, and the  air fairly scintillated with the intense heat; whilst at night the great  southern stars shone down upon us with their mild, calm splendour. Spite of  awnings fore and aft, paint-work blistered, and pitch oozed up in black streaks  along the decks, making even the leathery-skinned Kanakas pick their barefooted  way cautiously along the planking.</p>
<p>Drifting,  ever drifting, we seemed to be, on what was truly a summer sea. Throughout the  stifling nights, not a sound was to be heard save, at intervals, a grinding  creak, as the well-nigh useless rudder gave a sudden jerk in its case, or the  plop, now and again, of the hand-lead, with the drowsy voice of the leadsman singing  out the depths; for during the last twelve hours we had, in the set of an  easterly current, shoaled our water considerably; and I knew that under the  calm, lake-like sea, shoals and sharp coral reefs, lying thick, and unmarked as  yet in any chart, might at any moment make such a hole in the <i>Schoolboy&rsquo;s</i> bottom as we should find it  difficult to fill up.</p>
<p>On  the morning of the fourth day, however, a change took place. The sky grew  darker and darker, whilst a heavy swell came in from the westward, and in a few  minutes, at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, it was so dark that we could not see  each other.</p>
<p>Long  before this the schooner had been snugged down, and was now under a close-reefed  mains&rsquo;l, goose-wing foretops&rsquo;l, and storm stays&rsquo;l.</p>
<p>Everything  movable about the decks had been securely lashed, and in anxious expectation we  now awaited the result of this curious phenomenon of darkest night in day,  which, accustomed as most of us were to the portents that sometimes herald in  the terrific &ldquo;busters&rdquo; of these southern seas, all declared they had never seen  equalled.</p>
<p>The  darkness seemed to grow more and more oppressive. Men who had before been  conversing in whispers became silent. At last it came&mdash;came with a roar, an  awful, deafening bellow, which seemed to our paralysed hearing to have  annihilated, with one tremendous crash, both sea and sky.</p>
<p>The  schooner shook so violently that, unable to keep our footing on her decks, we  were thrown about in all directions, many receiving cuts and bruises against  sharp corners of the woodwork.</p>
<p>In  another moment, and almost before the last echoes of that dread explosion&mdash;I can  give it no other name&mdash;had died away, the whole area of vision, from horizon to  horizon, was illuminated by a burst of weird-looking, yellow-coloured light, or  rather flame, dazzlingly vivid, throwing into lurid relief every rope, spar,  and sail on board, every man&rsquo;s face, unnaturally tinted, but with its  expression of awe and amazement clearly discernible; sending its glare into the  darkest corners of the vessel; and then, after lasting for perhaps a minute and  a half, dying slowly away, as it were, into the oily, copper-coloured swell.</p>
<p>As  darkness once more fell over us, blacker and thicker than ever, each looked to  where he had last seen his neighbour, as if mutely asking what was to come  next. Still, there was no wind. The sea appeared to be in a strange turmoil,  and the <i>Schoolboy</i> was tossed hither  and thither like a straw in a raging whirlpool. Her bell rang incessantly. The  air was full of strange noises. All nature seemed in agony, fitting herald of  some wondrous transformation taking place around us.</p>
<p>Once  again came that flood of strange, unnatural-looking flame, disclosing to our  astonished and dazzled sight, the sea alongside, one mass of milk-white foam, which,  as the light increased in brilliancy, seethed, and tore past the vessel like a  flood of molten, foaming copper, as if under the influence of both wind and  tide, whilst our sails hung listlessly from the yards. But, strangest sight of  all, there, just astern, and apparently not two hundred yards away, rose a  perfect archipelago of rocks, the largest no more than about fifty feet high,  where never rock was before, and against which the sea dashed in showers of  spray.</p>
<p>The  last fading glow of that strange light lingered for a moment on the highest of  these islets brown and bare, reflected in thousands of prismatic hues from the  torrents of sea-water which poured down its miniature gullies.</p>
<p>Our  position was undoubtedly one of great peril, and every moment I expected to  feel the schooner&rsquo;s keel grate on the sharp reefs. I had, with no little  trouble, groped my way for&rsquo;ard, and imagine my joy to hear, just as I got to  the foremast, the roar of the gale coming up astern, and the captain&rsquo;s voice  cheerily singing out, &ldquo;Starboard foretops&rsquo;l braces! Ease off your mainsheet aft!&rdquo;  A joyful thing, I say, it was to hear the wind, and to know that, full of  hidden dangers though the sea ahead might be, still anything&mdash;ay, even the  worst&mdash;was almost preferable to another hour of suspense and anxiety such as we  had just passed through. The very fact of swift motion alone almost drove fear  away. So that when, heeling over to the fierce blast till her boom end swept  the water, the schooner tore through the thick darkness for over two hours, I  believe most of us felt comparatively safe.</p>
<p>At  length, like a flash, dazzling our eyes, and making us blink like so many owls  in daylight, we dashed from out the black screen into bright sunshine and blue  water.</p>
<p>So  sudden was the transit that two of the men appeared for some time to be quite  blind, and refused to believe, when told by others, that the blessed sunlight  was again shedding its rays upon them. However, they soon got all right again.</p>
<p>A  submarine volcano in active operation close to us is the only explanation I can  give of these phenomena, the supernatural and awe-inspiring appearance of which  I have failed to convey to the reader&rsquo;s imagination. Our Kanakas were nearly  insensible from fear most of the time, whilst the others, though not giving way  in an equal degree, were, nevertheless, much impressed by what they had  witnessed; and many were the looks cast behind us at that ominous curtain of  dreary darkness which still stretched across the ocean, and seemed blacker and  gloomier than ever by contrast with the sunshine which now surrounded us.</p>
<p>Shortly  after this, the man who acted as our cook and steward, and who had been ailing  for some weeks, died.</p>
<p>Jacob  Ink at once volunteered to take the dead man&rsquo;s place in cabin and galley; but to  this I was strongly opposed. However, it seemed there was no one else. The  dirty Kanakas were not to be thought of, and as for our white seamen, we were  too short-handed as it was. Thus it came to pass that Master Jacob, well aware  of his loss of prestige with the agent, and becoming apparently much more  subdued and careful in his manner towards everyone in consequence, glided  almost imperceptibly into the billet.</p>
<p>We  were now cruising about amongst the New Hebrides  and Solomons, touching at various islands, received at some with kindness, at  others with showers of spears and stones. Recruits seemed a myth of bygone  days. Mr. Agnew began to think that he had mistaken his vocation, and Jacob to  swear that kidnappers must have been busy quite lately. At some of the islands,  when presents of cloth, axes, etc., were held out to the natives, it only  seemed to make them more furious, and they danced along the beach like madmen,  shouting and throwing stones at us, and there was no doubt they could throw,  hard and straight, too.</p>
<p>At  San Christoval, where some canoes boarded us, they said that quite lately a  ship had sailed through the groups&mdash;not kidnapping &mdash;but her crew, landing, would  plunder native villages, destroy their taro plantations, slay any who dared to  remain and defend their property; then set the huts on fire, carrying off any  native women they could get hold of. By their description, the vessel was a  brig, and these doings gave us a clue to the warmth of some of our late  receptions.</p>
<p>The  agent determined now to try New Britain, and  then sail for the D&rsquo;Entrecasteaux group, whence no &ldquo;labour&rdquo; had as yet found  its way to Queensland.  If still unsuccessful, the captain, pleading the short-handed state of the  vessel, expressed his intention of steering for some port in which he could  make up his complement</p>
<p>The  New Britain islanders bore a bad record, and when, one fine morning, we lay-to  within the shadow of its lofty verdure-covered peaks, I cautioned the men, if  possible, to let no more than a dozen or so of the natives, whose canoes we  could now see coming off in scores, on board the schooner at the same time. We  were few&mdash;very few, and practically almost defenceless.</p>
<p>But  as to allowing them on board, it was just as I feared. We might as well have  attempted to stem the course of a mountain torrent with a walking-stick.</p>
<p>Under  the lee of the island the light breeze died away altogether, and as soon as the  fleet of canoes, each of which bore at its prow a green bough as a token of  amity, glided alongside, our decks were swarming with evil-looking,  unsavoury-smelling, naked savages, each with his woolly head resembling a huge  reddish mop, the hair being coloured with lime, and frizzled up as much as  possible. Through the cartilage of the nose was stuck a long fish-bone, and,  with some, the lobe of the ear was slit to receive such trifles as spike-nails,  pieces of old iron, bottles, or anything else they could steal, or that might  be given to them.</p>
<p>They  were unarmed, and seemed to have very little in the way of barter, save a few  bunches of bananas, some tortoiseshell, and a few handfuls of &ldquo;cats&rsquo;-eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All  the inhabitants of the South Sea Islands are, in a greater or less degree,  thieves; but I think the men of New    Britain bear off the palm. Our visitors, at all  events, lost no time in commencing operations.</p>
<p>One  of the deluded scamps would bend down and firmly grip a ring-bolt, his comrades  gathering around him to conceal what was going on. Having got what he  considered a fair hold on the coveted piece of iron, the savage would tug and  strain in vain efforts to draw it from the deck-planking; at length, desisting  from sheer exhaustion, a guttural murmur of disapproval would run through the  group, and another victim to insular ignorance would take his place, and so on,  till perhaps fifty had tried and failed, when it was comical in the extreme to  watch them shake their woolly heads, come to the conclusion that the particular  ring on which they had been expending their strength in vain must needs be <i>tabu</i>, and move on to repeat the same  performance, with the same amount of success, at the next one.</p>
<p>This  was all very well, but when a couple of them tackled a cross-cut saw, which  happened to be lying on the main hatchway, and, one holding each end, jumped  overboard and made swiftly for the shore, we looked on it as passing the bounds  of fairness, and accordingly the captain fired several shots at the swimmers  out of his revolver, but without effect; and when they reached the shore they,  much to the delight of their friends on board, who seemed in no way alarmed at  the firing, waved the saw in the air, making, at the same time, all manner of  signs of contempt and derision.</p>
<p>A  supreme effort was evidently now to be made in the recruiting line, for Jacob  appeared dressed in all the glory of his Brisbane  finery, and his turn-out evidently created a deep sensation among the natives.</p>
<p>Standing  on the little skylight, he harangued the crowd, who signified their pleasure by  repeatedly clapping their bent elbows with their open hands, and at the close  of his address, during which he repeatedly pointed to all parts of the vessel,  several pressed forward for Mr. Agnew to enlist, which he did willingly enough,  taking down the names to the best of his ability as Jacob called them out.</p>
<p>Eight,  who I noticed were all powerful men, evidently the pick of the crowd, were  recruited, and received each a small present, as an earnest of still better  things to come. Many more men, so the interpreter averred, were promised for  the morrow, but both the captain and myself, knowing the danger of having too  many natives from one place on board, advised the agent to let us cross over to  New Ireland first, and try our luck there. Backed up by the interpreter, who  assured him that his friends were eminently peaceful subjects, Mr. Agnew,  however, declared his intention of procuring his entire complement from New  Britain if possible, pleading, with some truth, our past rebuffs and failures  at so many other islands. More boats had in the meantime put off from the  shore, and the ship must have been surrounded by a perfect flotilla of not less  than three hundred.</p>
<p>The  last arrivals had in them some natives armed with spears and clubs, these  latter most unpleasant-looking objects, and I began to feel seriously uneasy as  our decks became more and more crowded&mdash;in fact, the ship for&rsquo;ard was wholly in  possession of the natives, and it was impossible to forget that we were  practically unarmed and at the mercy of our visitors, should it please them to  cut up rough.</p>
<p>Presently,  however, the evening sea-breeze sprang up, and with great difficulty getting a  pull at the braces, and shifting the head-sheets over, the <i>Schoolboy</i> began almost imperceptibly to lengthen her distance from  the land. The captain, in answer to Mr. Agnew&rsquo;s request, refused flatly to  anchor, considering it very unsafe in our comparatively unprotected state,  promising, however, to lay-to about four miles off, weather permitting, till  daylight.</p>
<p>The  canoes now began to drag astern, and those natives on board, seeing the schooner  beginning to move more and more swiftly through the water, began to make for  the shore, all except our new acquisitions, who remained in close conversation  with the interpreter, a personage whom they evidently regarded with the utmost  veneration.</p>
<p>It  was a custom on board the <i>Schoolboy</i> at eight bells in the evening, about the time that the watches were shifting,  for the officers to have a glass of grog in the cabin together before  separating for the night, and it was the steward&rsquo;s duty to set out tumblers,  water-jug, etc., for that purpose.</p>
<p>On  this particular night the captain and I drank ours and retired. Then Griffiths, whose first  watch it was, and Agnew came down the stairs, and I could plainly hear the  second mate chaffing the agent about his strongly-scented new friends. Then I  heard the former calling out to the steward to know what made the water taste  so bitter, and asking whether it had been taken out of the filter, then Jacob&rsquo;s  voice answering in the affirmative, saying, too, that he could not account for  the funny taste in the water, declaring at the same time that some of the crew  were also complaining.</p>
<p>I  had myself noticed a peculiar taste in the grog, but had thought little of it  at the time, and the captain had remarked that &ldquo;that black swab&rdquo; had neglected  to clean out the filter.</p>
<p>Agnew,  who slept on deck sometimes, and the second mate, now ascended again. I felt  horribly dozy, and half thinking that the &ldquo;grog&rdquo; must have been too strong, I  fell fast asleep.</p>
<p>Most  of us, I suppose, have experienced that undefinable sensation of suddenly  awaking with the feeling that there is something wrong &mdash; emphatically wrong &mdash;  somewhere, without being able to localise, or even give shape in our minds to  the thing that is amiss.</p>
<p>Well,  that&rsquo;s the way it was with me when I awoke out of a dreamless sleep. It was  broad daylight; I could see that much through the little dead-eye in my berth.  It was blowing a stiffish breeze; I could feel that. I could feel also that I  was terribly thirsty, so reached over for my water-jug and fairly emptied it.  On referring to my watch, I found that I had slept exactly twelve hours.</p>
<p>Looking  at the nail on which my revolver was wont to hang, I found that it was gone.  That indefinable sensation before alluded to became indefinable no longer; it  was now a certainty, and I localised it at once&mdash;Jacob.</p>
<p>The  door of my berth was unfastened, and entering the main cabin I heard sounds of  hearty snoring proceeding from the captain&rsquo;s cot. Entering his berth, I was  delighted to find him safe, and sound asleep. I shook him violently for fully  ten minutes, then, with much yawning and stretching, he awoke, much in the  state I had been in myself, and likewise emptied his water-jug.</p>
<p>Graver  and graver grew the old skipper&rsquo;s face as he listened to my suspicions, and his  eye glanced to where his revolver had hung. It was gone!</p>
<p>We  both entered the little saloon to see what could be done.</p>
<p>We  tried the hatchway. It was fast as a rock. No get-out for us yet&mdash;that seemed  certain, and we were fairly puzzled. Where were Griffiths, Agnew, and the rest  of the men? Had they also been drugged with some vile South Sea  decoction, as I was now satisfied had been the case with us? Had Jacob murdered  them? and if so, why, whilst they were at his mercy, had he not disposed of the  two who, as he was well aware, disliked him more heartily than any of the  others?</p>
<p>Neither  of us, sitting there in the semi-darkness of the cabin&mdash;a sail or something of  the kind had been thrown over the skylight&mdash;could come to any definite conclusion  about the matter save&mdash;and we were both in accord there &mdash;that the interpreter  was the master-spirit of whatever mischief was going on aboard the <i>Schoolboy</i>.</p>
<p>Sure  enough, presently, we could hear his voice cursing the Kanakas for a set of  lazy black lubbers, and threatening to blow their brains out if they weren&rsquo;t  more lively.</p>
<p>Just  in front of the wheel was a little booby hatchway, the only means of getting in  and out of the cabin; and the skylight before alluded to being a fixture, I  tried again, but in vain, to slide back the corner of the hatch&mdash;it was too  firmly secured.</p>
<p>Three  good-sized auger-holes had been bored in one of the doors, but for what purpose  I know not. Applying my eye to one of these, I could see, about six feet away,  and just opposite to me, the dungaree-covered legs and bare black feet of the  helmsman, whom I knew to be one of our Kanaka seamen. From my position, strain  and bend as I might, my line of vision could ascend no higher than his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam,&rdquo;  I whispered pretty loudly, &ldquo;open the hatchway, and let us out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  de love o&rsquo; hebben, sah, stop quick!&rdquo; was the alarmed answer. &ldquo;Jacob, him boss  here now. He hear me speak, he shoot me like one crow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  quite believed that, and, not wishing to get the man into trouble, descended  into the cabin again.</p>
<p>Presently,  with a lot of yelling and shouting, Jacob coming to the wheel, they managed to  put the schooner round, and, running into my berth, I could, on this tack, see,  through the deadlight, the island of New Britain, about five or six miles away  up to the windward.</p>
<p>Jacob  had evidently got farther out than he had intended&mdash;the wind must have shifted  some time during the night&mdash;and he was now doing his best to get back again to  the island. The black rascal had, doubtless, often before attempted to suborn  our Kanakas, but without success, until they became intimidated at seeing him  backed up by the strong party of new recruits, and, at the same time, knowing  that their own officers were hopelessly trapped. I believe that the plot had  been communicated to the natives when they first came on board, so that whilst,  as poor Agnew had imagined, Jacob was holding forth to the crowd upon the  delights and pleasures of plantation life in Queensland, he was, in reality,  pointing out to them, with all the eloquence of which he was master, what a  mine of wealth the schooner would prove, could they but once get possession of  her.</p>
<p>I  thought I saw through the whole affair pretty clearly now. My only puzzle was  to know what had become of the rest of our party. Were they still under the  influence of the drug, or had worse befallen them?</p>
<p>Meanwhile  the captain was perfectly wild with rage. Accustomed as he had always been to  look down upon and despise the &ldquo;nigs,&rdquo; thus to be circumvented and imprisoned  on board his own vessel by one of them was more than he could bear with  anything like composure, and he marched up and down the cabin in a state but  little short of madness.</p>
<p>Presently  I heard the sliding top of the scuttle or hatchway pushed back, a shaft of  sunshine streamed down into the cabin, and, looking up, we saw the interpreter&rsquo;s  ugly face gazing down at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  you two getting on down there&mdash;eh?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Pretty well? My word, you had  fine sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  you black sweep!&rdquo; roared the skipper, as he made a dash at the staircase.</p>
<p>But  Jacob, pointing a revolver at his head, sang out sternly to &ldquo;get back, or he  would blow his brains out!&rdquo; a command that had to be quickly obeyed, for the  captain knew that the slightest hesitation would be fatal; as he remarked  afterwards, he &ldquo;could see it in the cussed nigger&rsquo;s eye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  are Mr. Agnew, Mr. Griffiths, and the rest of the men, Jacob?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  gone a-fishin&rsquo;, mister mate,&rdquo; replied the grinning villain. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo; keep &rsquo;em  from tumblin&rsquo; overboard. Seems like &rsquo;s if they was boun&rsquo; to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  scoundrel!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;do you mean to tell me that you&rsquo;ve murdered them  all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me?&rdquo;  indignantly replied the interpreter. &ldquo;You know I love Mister Agnew, an&rsquo; Mister  Griffits, an&rsquo; all of &rsquo;em too much to hurt one little hair on their heads&mdash;not  one least little bit. My word! Them rascal boys we get yesterday, they do it  all. I tried stop &rsquo;em. Never mind me. An&rsquo; now, mister mate, an&rsquo; old skipper  there, you know what they say, them rascal boys? They say, take your two  fellers home with &rsquo;em, then make big fire, roast you both, an&rsquo; have first-class  feed. My word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jacob,  as he thus delivered himself, grinned complacently, shut the slide, and left us  once more to our reflections.</p>
<h3 align="center"><b>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;My Name&rsquo;s Hayes&rdquo;</b></h3>
<p>The  reality, then, was as bad as the worst form our many surmises had taken.</p>
<p>The  captain seemed not to have the slightest doubt about it. His idea was that the  men had been pitched overboard while in a state of stupor. Once there, the  sharks would soon put an end to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going  to eat us&mdash;nothing less!&rdquo; went on the old skipper. &ldquo;Yes, I believe that too; for  don&rsquo;t you see that you and I are far and away the stoutest and heaviest men on  board? They&rsquo;re evidently keeping us for a sort of thanksgiving feast. But  before I&rsquo;ll allow a nigger to sharpen his teeth on my bones, I swear I&rsquo;ll set  the boat on fire. Only think of us letting a black sweep, like that Jacob, work  such a traverse as this on us! I believe, now, that it was a put-up job from  the very first, and poor Agnew, through his pigheadedness and mulish ways, d&rsquo;ye  see, gave the nigger every chance to carry his scheme out. He&rsquo;ll doubtless now  run the schooner ashore, if he can only get in. Let us hope it may come on to  blow so heavy that the lubberly brute and his mates won&rsquo;t be able to work her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  seemed actually, except that idea of the captain&rsquo;s&mdash;about setting fire to the  vessel&mdash; nothing that we could possibly do to avert our fate.</p>
<p>To  be either done to a turn by some savage <i>chef  de cuisine</i>, then devoured amongst the rejoicings of himself and fellows, or  to be roasted on the schooner, and furnish a welcome meal for a shark, or some  other voracious monster!</p>
<p>After  balancing the two alternatives carefully, I came to the conclusion that there  wasn&rsquo;t so very much to choose between them; but I was very far from being  enamoured of either, and determined to make another attempt to burst the door  open, if it was only to get shot down as soon as I put my head over the hatch.</p>
<p>I  knew well that, if anything was to be done, it must be done at once, for, let  the canoes come around us again, as they were pretty sure to do directly, and  our case would be hopeless.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  I was astonished to see the captain jump off the locker upon which he had been  sitting in moody silence, and rush headlong into the agent&rsquo;s berth. I followed,  and found him on his knees, tossing over the contents of Agnew&rsquo;s large chest.  What was my surprise, presently, to catch sight, amongst the articles being  bundled out pell-mell upon the deck, of a brand-new six-chambered revolver.</p>
<p>An  exclamation of delight escaped old Adams as he  too caught sight of the weapon, and took it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  just came into my mind, as I was sitting there in the dumps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;d  heard poor Agnew say, one night, that, had he known it, he might have saved the  price of a revolver, for that, unaware of the owner&rsquo;s liberality in providing  him with one, he had, the day before he sailed, bought one at Johnson&rsquo;s. That  black wretch made sure of all the others; but, please God, if we can but find  cartridges, we&rsquo;ll beat him yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure  enough, in a small leather courier-bag, we presently came across about fifty &ldquo;Lefacheux&rdquo;  cartridges to fit the pistol.</p>
<p>I  could see that the captain had an idea. Hastily loading, and giving me a  handful of the cartridges, he crept up the companion-steps and peeped through  one of the auger-holes before mentioned, but soon descended with a disappointed  look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that Jacob might still be at the wheel. Could we but kill  or cripple him, I believe our own Kanakas, who, I&rsquo;m sure, are acting under  compulsion, for I&rsquo;ve had two of &rsquo;em&mdash;Sam and his mate&mdash;with me for a couple of  trips before, would soon let us out, and then&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready  about!&rdquo; shouted Jacob on deck; and the captain, making a gesture of caution,  again quickly made his way to the loophole, hoping that the interpreter might,  as before, himself take the wheel during the manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Nor  was he disappointed. With a motion of his hand, he let me know that all was right  so far. Then I saw him, still kneeling, advance the muzzle of the revolver, and  appear to take aim. It was an anxious moment, and the whirr and rattle of the  wheel, as it was put hard-a-lee, made me jump again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  out there, for&rsquo;ard,&rdquo; shouted Jacob, &ldquo;or I&rsquo;ll&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But  crack, crack, from the skipper&rsquo;s revolver cut short the sentence. Then followed  a howl of agony; hasty footsteps came tramping aft, then a curious scraping  noise, and a shock that made the <i>Schoolboy</i> tremble in every plank, and sent the captain and myself fairly flying to the  far end of the cabin, where, for a moment, we laid half-stunned, whilst the  schooner slowly heeled over till I made sure that she was turning turtle with  us. However, when she was nearly on her beam-ends, she stopped, and seemed, for  the time at least, comfortably settled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missed  stays, and got on to a reef!&rdquo; shouted the excited skipper. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve winged Mr.  Ink in a way he won&rsquo;t forget in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  now, picking ourselves up, we commenced &mdash;the captain with his pistol, and  myself with the lid of one of the lockers which I had torn off&mdash;to hammer away  at the companion door and skylight respectively, with all our might.</p>
<p>Amidst  a lot of yelling and shouting, the hatch was at length pushed back. Three or  four shots were heard, and the skipper, rushing on deck, fell headlong over the  body of one of our Kanakas. I followed, clutching my locker-lid, and, once on  the sloping deck, a truly curious scene met my eye.</p>
<p>The  interpreter, with apparently both of his legs broken, lay to leeward, grasping  a still smoking revolver, but already knocked senseless by the captain. At my  feet was the dead body of the Kanaka, Sam, evidently shot by Jacob whilst  endeavouring to liberate us.</p>
<p>For&rsquo;ard,  huddled up like a lot of sheep, were the recruits, amongst whom old Adams, maddened by bitter resentment at the treatment he  had suffered and the wreck of the schooner, was firing as fast as he could pull  the trigger. Presently I saw three survivors jump overboard and make for the  shore. Thinking to myself that I would not give much for their chance, I turned  my attention to the position of our vessel, and found that she had been forced  into a sort of natural cradle on the reef, and most fortunate for us that it  was so, or she would undoubtedly have sunk at once. As it was, she kept bumping  and grinding in a way that convinced me her time was very short.</p>
<p>On  our starboard bow, distant about three miles, lay New Britain, a mass of dark  green vegetation, between which and the schooner I could see a fleet of canoes  coming off under sail and paddle.</p>
<p>Climbing  up to windward, and looking out to sea, I saw, to my delight and surprise, not  more than a mile away, a fine clipper brig coming straight for us, and  evidently bringing the breeze with her. This was indeed a joyful sight, and  going to the signal-locker, I bent the ensign on, Union  down, and ran it up to the gaff-end.</p>
<p>The  skipper now walked aft, looking very grim, and simply remarking, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all  gone, true enough,&rdquo; he bent down to inspect Jacob.</p>
<p>I  called his attention to the brig, and with just a glance at her he said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  be too late now, unless she hurries up a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  truly, what between the canoes, by this barely a mile away, and the schooner,  which I thought must soon break up, things promised to look rather lively for  us directly.</p>
<p>Our  Kanakas had disappeared, fearing they might be the next to fall victims to that  terrible revolver.</p>
<p>In  response to a kick, Jacob showed that he was not dead yet, although in a sorry  plight, with a bullet in the cap of each knee, and a skull, hard and thick  though it was, showing marks of contact with a revolver-butt.</p>
<p>Groaning  dismally, the murdering villain looked up at us and muttered&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy,  captain! Mercy, mister mate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  are Agnew, Griffiths, and the other three men?&rdquo; asked the captain, as he  reloaded his revolvers, giving me one, and glancing at the fast-approaching  canoes, and then at the brig, which the people in the former had not yet caught  sight of, concealed as she was by the schooner.</p>
<p>A  groan was the interpreter&rsquo;s only answer to the captain&rsquo;s question, and the  latter, before I was aware of what he was about, had put a running bow-line  under Jacob&rsquo;s arms and lowered him over the side, where he hung, nearly up to  his neck in the water.</p>
<p>For  a minute his shrieks were awful, then all was silence; he had fainted.</p>
<p>Had  I been inclined to interfere with the captain&rsquo;s idea of prolonging the man&rsquo;s  agony it would have probably been useless; but I felt no such impulse. The  cruel instigator of Stevens&rsquo; death, and the murderer of the rest of my  shipmates, and of his too confiding master, poor Agnew, was only getting his  just deserts, it seemed to me.</p>
<p>Rousing  out the Kanakas from the forcastle, where they had taken refuge in fear and  trembling, I now endeavoured to get our longboat, which was lashed across the  main hatchway, into the water, as every moment I expected to see the schooner  part in two, her back being broken.</p>
<p>Whilst  thus engaged, I questioned Peter, dead Sam&rsquo;s mate and fellow-islander, as to  the manner in which our unfortunate shipmates had met their fate.</p>
<p>It  had, it seems, been Peter&rsquo;s first wheel in the second mate&rsquo;s watch, and shortly  after one bell, or half-past eight, had struck, he saw, to his great surprise,  that both the agent and the second mate were fast asleep, one on the skylight,  the other on a hencoop. The next thing he knew was Jacob presenting a revolver  at his head, and telling him that the vessel now belonged to him, and that if  himself and his fellows did not obey his orders, he would shoot them and throw  them overboard at once.</p>
<p>Presently  some of the new recruits appeared, and by Jacob&rsquo;s orders carried the insensible  bodies of the second mate and agent for&rsquo;ard. Peter averred that, before this,  the recruits had killed the three seamen, upon whom the drug had only partially  taken effect, by smashing their skulls in with handspikes. Another Kanaka  corroborated this, and added, that being able to understand a little of what  was said, he could make out that the islanders wished to keep the bodies till  they got ashore, and then eat them.</p>
<p>Jacob  refused to allow this, but promised that they should have the two fat ones aft.  The dead bodies were then thrown overboard, dozens of sharks were soon  attracted to the spot, and, when they had apparently finished their horrid  work, Agnew and the second mate were thrown to them, without being otherwise touched.  The four Kanakas all agreed that not a cry from beginning to end of the tragedy  was heard from the sufferers. They were not altogether unavenged, however. Five  savages lay dead at the foot of the windlass, and the arch-villain of all was  feeling a little of the agony he had caused others.</p>
<p>At  length, with the aid of a tackle on the mainstay, we got the long-boat safely  into the water, and telling the Kanakas to put water, sail, mast, and oars into  her, I scrambled aft to see about provisions, and how things were going on.</p>
<p>The  canoes, having caught sight of the brig, were now clustered into a group, save  two, who had shot out from the main body with the intention of saving a  solitary swimmer. I could just make out the black spot, but whilst reaching the  glass off the skylight, and adjusting it, when I again looked it had  disappeared, and the canoes had turned back again, the whole body of them  making for the island as quickly as they could.</p>
<p>The  brig, taking no notice of our distress signal, was also standing in straight  for the land, leaving the fleet of canoes on her left hand. Her colours were  flying, and I made them out to be Spanish.</p>
<p>Our  captain and myself now got together stores, compass, sextant, etc., and put  them into the boat, which, with one man in her, we veered off from the vessel.</p>
<p>In  the hurry and bustle of all this, I had completely forgotten the interpreter,  but now, looking aft, I saw that the sea was alive with great sharks, darting  hither and thither. I could see, too, the body, looking like a long, black blot  in the clear, bluish-green water, as, at every uneasy, grinding lurch of the  schooner on her hard bed, it rose and sank, sometimes showing as far as the  knees, then immersed to the neck again.</p>
<p>The  man was, no doubt, already half dead, certainly insensible, but I could bear  the sight no longer, so, seizing a tomahawk which laid handy, I, much to the  captain&rsquo;s disgust, severed the rope with one blow.</p>
<p>A  rush from twenty different quarters, a whirl of red-tinged foam, an upheaval of  many glittering bellies, and the interpreter was a thing of the past.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * * *</p>
<p>A  sound of heavy firing now drew our attention to leeward, and there we saw that  the brig, having got between the boats and the island, was dealing out to them,  what old Adams, in his glee at the sight,  called &ldquo;particular fits,&rdquo; scattering and sinking the canoe-fleet in all  directions.</p>
<p>Broadside  after broadside, from both rifles and heavier metal, was showered upon the  islanders, till the smoke at length hung so thick and low that we could see  nothing of either party.</p>
<p>The  breeze, which had almost entirely died away during the last half an hour, now  began to come in pretty briskly from the seaward, and little white crests,  earnest of what was in store behind them, were breaking gently, here and there,  upon the reef, bursting softly against the schooner&rsquo;s side, then falling back  again in thousands of snowy flakes.</p>
<p>All  hands now getting into the boat, we pulled round the wreck, seeing plainly  that, had it not been for the curious coral-berth into which she had been  forced, and the fair weather prevailing, she would have worked off into deep  water and foundered at once. As it was, with the incoming swell, she was  working and grinding terribly, and great white splinters came to the surface at  intervals, showing the mischief that was going on down below.</p>
<p>I  never in my life saw sharks so numerous and so bold, not troubling themselves  in the least to get out of our way when prodded with boathooks. They were  doubtless waiting for the dead bodies for&rsquo;ard, whose blood still oozed, black  and thick, out of the scupper-holes.</p>
<p>Hoisting  our sail, we made for the brig, which, with her port tacks aboard, was standing  over towards us.</p>
<p>Not  a single canoe was in sight. In about half an hour we were alongside the  stranger, and, boarding her, we let our boat, with the Kanakas in it, tow  astern.</p>
<p>I  looked around curiously enough, as I stepped on to her quarter-deck, and had  little difficulty in making up my mind as to her character.</p>
<p>A  stout, middle-aged man now came forward, saying&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  d&rsquo;ye do? Saw you were pretty snug for an hour or two, so stood on, an&rsquo; had a  bit o&rsquo; fun with the nigs. I owed &rsquo;em one this long time. Guess we&rsquo;re about  square now. Skipper an&rsquo; mate&mdash;eh? Guess the after-guard&rsquo;s in luck, anyhow.&rdquo; This  when we told him who we were. &ldquo;Come down an&rsquo; freshen the nip! My name&rsquo;s Hayes.  Heard of me, I&rsquo;ll bet a dollar! Seen the <i>Wasp</i> lately? Anythin&rsquo; in the schooner worth havin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calling  up one of his officers, a foreigner of some kind, he whispered something to  him, and as we descended the cabin stairs, having had no chance to answer his  many questions, I could plainly hear the &ldquo;cheep&rdquo; of the boat-falls, as they  were overhauled from the davits.</p>
<p>Of  course we had&mdash;there were very few people who had not about that time, and well  he knew it&mdash;heard of &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; Hayes, South Sea thief, bland robber, pirate&mdash;call  him what you will; but it was the first time either of us had set eyes on him.  I had heard just before we left Brisbane that he  had stolen a nearly new brig out of some New Zealand port, and no doubt this  was the vessel that the natives of San Christoval had told us about, as playing  up such pranks through the islands lately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart  chap, that Jacob, for a nig!&rdquo; remarked he, as we told him the outlines of our  story. &ldquo;I guess now he&rsquo;s had the bulge on you pretty considerable this trip, if  the sharks have got him. I knew the nig, well. Had him &rsquo;bout here with me, in  the <i>Ruby</i> cutter for a long time. Then  I heard of him goin&rsquo; back to the missionaries, an&rsquo; he was before the mast in  the <i>John Wesley</i> for a spell; used to  come down here, shiftin&rsquo; their native teachers &rsquo;bout from one place to the  other. S&rsquo;pose, now, you ain&rsquo;t seen anythin&rsquo; of the <i>Janestown</i>, sloop-o&rsquo;-war, &rsquo;bout these parts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  told him we had seen no cruisers lately belonging to either Her Majesty or  Uncle Sam, both of whose naval commanders of ships on the Australian or Pacific  coasts would, we well knew, be only too happy to interview him. This latter  fact we did not mention, thinking it would be superfluous to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain&rdquo;  Hayes now pressed us to take a passage with him as far as Batavia,  as he was getting tired of the South Seas, and  was going to take a stretch over that way. We thanked him sincerely for coming  so opportunely to our assistance; we thanked him, too, for his offer, but  declined it, saying that our boat was well found in every requisite for a long  trip, if need be, and that we thought we could make the mainland in her  comfortably enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Right you are, mates,&rdquo; said he carelessly. &ldquo;Some  people don&rsquo;t know when they do get a good offer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  now went on deck, and I could see a couple of the brig&rsquo;s boats, full of men,  alongside the schooner, apparently taking everything movable out of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t last till eight bells against this breeze,&rdquo; said Hayes, &ldquo;so we might as  well make what we can out of her. Anyhow, you owe me somethin&rsquo; for scattering  those nigs the way I did. Come, now, think it over a bit, the two of you. You&rsquo;d  best take a run down to the eastern seas with me. We&rsquo;ll get somethin&rsquo; worth  pickin up there, or I am much out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  both respectfully declined once more, and looking at the villainous faces of  his motley crew, consisting seemingly of almost every nationality under the  sky, the evident lack of all authority, the stands of boarding-pikes and  cutlasses, with four carronades on each side, and a good-sized traveller-gun  amidships, I wondered much that Mr. Hayes&rsquo; &ldquo;pickin up&rdquo; career had not been cut short long ago.</p>
<p>He  was a perfect anachronism, this stealer of oranges, copra, and cocoanuts,  kidnapper of dark-skinned maidens, and slayer wholesale of their  relations&mdash;fully a century after his time, and, curiously enough, though several  war-vessels kept a sharp look-out for him, he eluded them all.</p>
<p>One  fine morning, however, whilst sailing along through the Straits of Banca, he  took it into his head to shoot the man at the wheel. Going down to his cabin  for a revolver to carry out his threat, the sailor, who naturally couldn&rsquo;t see  the necessity, went for a capstan-bar, and, as Hayes ascended, made an end of  him with one blow.</p>
<p>I  was not sorry, at length, to get back into our boat, cast off the painter, and  say goodbye to the brig and her commander, whom I had noticed casting longing  glances at our craft, which was new, and a first-class article of her kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he sang out, &ldquo;so long, then, if you must go. Guess we keep no men here &rsquo;gainst  their will. My name&rsquo;s Hayes, and don&rsquo;t you forget it. I&rsquo;m upstraight an&rsquo;  downright&mdash; that&rsquo;s the kind of chicken I am. So long to ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My  first look, on getting the sail hoisted again, was towards the schooner, or  rather towards where the schooner had been, for, in the red light of the  setting sun, only a swirl of white breakers foaming over the solitary reef met  my eye.</p>
<p>The  brig&rsquo;s two boats, apparently deeply laden, were pulling slowly back, their  crews chanting some wild chorus which sounded eerie and sad through the fast  freshening breeze, indeed half a gale now, as we took a couple of reefs in our  sail, spliced the main-brace all round, set the watches, and steered a course  for Cape Bowling-Green.</p>
<p>For  the next few days we had pretty hard times of it, and got blown away to the nor&rsquo;ard  by a succession of heavy gales, but at last we were picked up by the Torres  Straits mail-steamer, <i>Moulamein</i>,  which landed us safely at Townsville.</p>
<p>And  that is the full, true, and particular account of the loss of the schooner <i>Schoolboy</i>, and of all that happened to  her crew.</p>
