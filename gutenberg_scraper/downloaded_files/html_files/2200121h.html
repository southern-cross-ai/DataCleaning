<h2 align="center"><a name="Preface"></a>Preface</h2>
<p>I had long wished to write a story about children, which  should be interesting to childish readers, and yet not without interest for grown-up  people: but that desire might never have been realized without the unexpected impulse  of a suggestion, dropped casually in the freedom of conversation at a table where  the clever hostess is ever an incentive to bright thoughts. The talk was of Christmas;  and almost everybody agreed that the season, considered from the old-fashioned festal  standpoint, was pure irony. Was it not a time of extra burdens, of manifold claims  upon everybody&rsquo;s purse and care, of great expectations from all sorts of people,  of worry and weariness? Except for the children! There we were unanimous.</p>
<p>Christmas was the children&rsquo;s festival &mdash; for us a rush  and a scramble, and a perpetual paying away of money; for them a glimpse of Fairyland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we had no children of our own,&rdquo; said my left-hand  neighbour, &ldquo;we ought to hire some for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought it was a pretty fancy; and on that foundation  built the little story of the Christmas Hirelings, which is now reproduced in book  form from last year&rsquo;s Christmas Number of the <i>Lady&rsquo;s Pictorial,</i> and which I hope even after that wide circulation  all over the English-speaking world may find a new public at home &mdash; the public of  mothers and aunts and kind uncles, in quest of stories that please children. This  story was a labour of love, a holiday task, written beside the fire in the long  autumn evenings when the south-west wind was howling in the Forest  trees outside.</p>
<p>The living models for the three children were close  at hand, dear and familiar to the writer; and Moppet&rsquo;s long words and quaint little  mannerisms are but the pale reproduction of words and looks and gestures in the  tiny girl who was then my next-door neighbour, and who is now far away in the shadow  of the Himalayas.</p>
<p>The character of Mr. Danby, whom some of my critics  have been kind enough to praise, was suggested by the following passage in the first  series of the &ldquo;Greville Memoirs,&rdquo; copied in my commonplace-book long ago, when everybody  was reading those delightful reminiscences: &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Creevy &mdash; an attorney or barrister &mdash; married a widow,  who died a few years ago. She had something, he nothing. His wife died, upon which  event he was thrown upon the world with about two hundred a year, or less, no home,  few connections, a great many acquaintance, a good constitution, and extraordinary  spirits. He possesses nothing but his clothes, no property of any sort; he leads  a vagrant life, visiting a number of people who are delighted to have him, and sometimes  roving about to various places as fancy happens to direct, and staying till he has  spent what money he has in his pocket. He has no servant, no home, no creditors;  he buys everything as he wants it at the place he is at; he has no ties upon him,  and has his time entirely at his own disposal and that of his friends. He is certainly  a living proof that a man may be perfectly happy and exceedingly poor, or rather  without riches, for he suffers none of the privations of poverty, and enjoys many  of the advantages of wealth. I think he is the only man I know in society who possesses  nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><a name="Prologue"></a>Prologue</h2>
<p>The scene was the library at Penlyon Place, commonly called for shortness  &mdash; Place. The personages were Sir John Penlyon, a great landed proprietor, and a  line gentleman of the early Victorian school; his niece, Miss Adela Hawberk, a smart  young lady, whose paternal home was in South Kensington: and Mr. Danby, the useful  friend, whose home was everywhere. Home of his own Mr. Danby had none. He had drifted  lightly on the stream of life for the last forty years, living in other people&rsquo;s  houses, and, more or less, at other people&rsquo;s expense; yet there lived not the man  or woman who would have dared to describe Mr. Danby as a sponge or a toady, as anybody&rsquo;s  hanger-on or parasite. Mr. Danby only went where he was wanted; and the graces of  his manner and the qualities of his mind and heart were such that Mr. Danby was  wanted everywhere. He had invitations three years deep. His engagements were as  far in the future as the calculations in the nautical almanac. Some people, who  had been trying for years to get Mr. Danby to their houses, compared him to that  star whose inhabitants may now be contemplating the Crimean War of 1854.</p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon and Mr. Danby had been schoolfellows  at Eton, and chums at Christchurch;  and, whomsoever else he disappointed, Mr. Danby never omitted his annual visits  to Penlyon Place.  He Christmassed there, and he Eastered there, and he knew the owner of the fine  old Tudor house inside and out, his vices and his virtues, his weaknesses, and his  prejudices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That there Danby,&rdquo; said Sir John&rsquo;s valet, &ldquo;can turn  the old chap round his finger; but he&rsquo;s a good feller, is Danby, a gentleman to  the marrer, and nobody&rsquo;s any the worse for &rsquo;is hinfluence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The library at Penlyon was one of those rooms in which  to live seems enough for bliss. A lovely old room, full of fantastic lights and  shadows in the December gloaming; a spacious room, lined with books in the most  exquisite bindings, for the binding of his books was more to Sir John than the letterpress  inside. He was very fond of his library; he was very fond of his books. He looked  at the bindings; and he read the newspapers and magazines which were heaped on a  carved oak table at one end of the room.</p>
<p>Miss Hawberk sat in a low chair, with her feet on the  fender, apparently lost in admiration of her Queen Anne shoes. She had lately come  in from a long walk on the moor with the useful friend, and had changed her clump-soled  boots for these pointed toes, which set off the high instep that was considered  a family mark of the Penlyons. A flat-footed Penlyon would have been thrust out  and repudiated by the rest of the clan, perhaps, like a sick cow to which the herd  gives the <i>coup de gr&acirc;ce.</i></p>
<p>Sir John was standing on the hearth-rug with his back  to the crackling wood fire, contemplating his books as the fire-glow lit up their  varied bindings. Mr. Danby was resting luxuriously after his moorland walk, in quite  the most comfortable chair in the room, not too near the fire, for Danby was careful  of his complexion. At sixty-three years of age a man, who means to be good-looking  to the end, has to be careful of his complexion.</p>
<p>Danby was a slenderly-built man, of middle height. He  had never been handsome, but he had neat, inoffensive features, bright grey eyes,  light brown hair, with a touch of silver in it, and perfect hands and feet. He reminded  elderly people of that accomplished and amiable gentleman, Charles Matthews, the  younger.</p>
<p>Miss Hawberk was tall and handsome. She prided herself  in the first place upon being every inch a Penlyon, and in the second place upon  being undeniably smart. She belonged to a set which, in the London season, sees a good deal of the Royalties,  and, like most people who are in touch with personages of the blood royal, she very  often talked about them.</p>
<p>So much for the actors in the social drama, which was  in this very hour to begin at Penlyon   Castle. The curtain is up,  and the first words of the play drop quietly from the lips of Sir John.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. Christmas again, Danby! I think of all the  boring seasons Christmas is the most boring.</p>
<p>ADELA <i>(reproachfully).</i> My dear uncle, that sounds like forgetting what Christmas means.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. What does Christmas mean to any British householder?  Firstly, an extra Sunday, wedged into the week, &mdash; and at my age the longest week  is too short, and all the Sundays are too near together; secondly, an overwhelming  shower of stationery in the shape of pamphlets, booklets, circulars, and reports  of every imaginable kind of philanthropic scheme for extracting money from the well-to-do  classes &mdash; schemes so many and so various that a man will harden his heart against  the cry of the poor rather than he will take the trouble to consider the multitude  of institutions that have been invented to relieve their distresses; thirdly, a  servants&rsquo; hall, which generally sets all the servants by the ears, and sometimes  sets the house on fire; fourthly, a cloud of letters from poor relatives and friends  one would willingly forget, only to be answered decently with a cheque. I won&rsquo;t  speak of bills, for the so-called Christmas bills are held back till January, to  embitter the beginning of the year, and to remind a man that he was born to trouble,  as the sparks fly upward.</p>
<p>Sir John takes up the poker, and illustrates this  passage of holy writ by striking a tremendous shower of sparks out of a burning  pine log.</p>
<p>DANBY. I don&rsquo;t think <i>you</i> need mind Christmas. You are rich enough to satisfy everybody, even  the philanthropic gentlemen; or you may plunge for two or three of the best established  and soundest charities &mdash; hospitals, for choice &mdash; and give a round sum to each of  them. That is what I would do if I were a rich man. And as for festivities, why,  you and I are too old, and Miss Hawberk is too sensible to want any fuss of that  kind; so we can just put up with the extra Sunday, and pull up the arrears of our  correspondence between luncheon and dinner, while the servants are lingering over  their Christmas dessert.</p>
<p>MISS HAWBERK <i>(with  a faint sigh).</i> That is all very well; but I think Christmas Day ought to be  different from other days, somehow.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN <i>(impatiently).</i> Somehow, yes, but which how? What are we, civilized people, with plenty of common  sense and no silly sentiment &mdash; what are we to do year after year in order to lash  ourselves into the humour for Christmas mirth and Christmas benevolence? It was  all very well for a miserly old churl like Dickens&rsquo;s Scrooge to break out suddenly  into kindness and joviality, after a long life of avarice. Giving away turkeys and  drinking punch were new sensations for him. But for us, who have been giving away  turkeys and putting our sovereigns in the plate for nearly fifty Christmas Days!  You can&rsquo;t expect me to be enthusiastic about Christmas, Adela, any more than you  would expect me to hang up my stocking when I go to bed on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p>MISS HAWBERK. Oh, that stocking! How old I feel when  I think of it! How firmly I believed in Santa Claus, and how happy I used to be  on Christmas morning when I found pretty things in my stocking, or heaped up at  the end of my bed! The stocking would not hold a quarter of my presents. I know  one year when we were at Bournemouth I had a sweet little sketch of a kitten sent  by the Hereditary Princess of Kostroma, who was wintering at the Bath for her chest.  She had seen me playing in a corner with my kitten a week or two before, when she  was taking tea with mother, don&rsquo;t you know.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN <i>(looking  as if he neither knew nor cared about this feline incident).</i> Stockings, presents,  Santa Claus! Ah, there you&rsquo;ve hit the mark, Adela. Christmas is a splendid institution  in a house where there are children. Christmas can hardly be made too much of where  there are children in question. No, Adela, I am not such a heathen as you think.  I have not forgotten the meaning of Christmas. I can still remember that it is a  festival kept in reverential memory of a Holy Child. If you were not your mother&rsquo;s  only daughter and grown up &mdash; if somehow or other I had a pack of children belonging  to me, I would keep Christmas with the best &mdash; keep it as it ought to be kept. But  the Penlyons are a vanishing race. I have no children to look to me for gladness.</p>
<p><i>(A Silence.)</i> Adela Hawberk looks at the  fire gravely, thoughtfully, mournfully, and a blush mounts to her fair forehead,  and slowly fades away. Perhaps she is thinking of a certain young officer in a cavalry  regiment, to whom she is not actually engaged, but who may some day be her husband,  if the home authorities are agreeable. And she thinks of a dim, far-off time when  she and her husband, and possibly their children, may be Christmassing at Penlyon Castle. The vision seems very remote, almost  impossible; yet such things have been. Sir John stares at his books resolutely.</p>
<p>DANBY <i>(who has  been dropping asleep in his dusky corner, rouses himself suddenly).</i> Children,  yes, of course! Nobody knows how to enjoy Christmas if he has no children to make  happy. If one has no children of one&rsquo;s own, one ought to hire some for the Christmas  week &mdash; children to cram with mince pies and plum pudding; children to take to the  pantomime; children to let off crackers; children to take on the ice. I have any  number of godchildren scattered about among the houses of my friends, and I feel  half a century younger when I am romping with them. What do you think of my notion,  Miss Hawberk? Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a good dodge to hire some children for  Christmas Day? Your cottages swarm with brats. We should have only to pick and choose.</p>
<p>MISS HAWBERK. Cottagers&rsquo; children generally have colds  in their heads. I don&rsquo;t think one could stand cottagers&rsquo; children for more than  an hour or two. I am very fond of children, but I like them to belong to my own  class.</p>
<p>DANBY. I understand. You want little ladies and gentlemen,  with whom you could romp at your ease. I believe even that could be managed. What  do you say, Sir John? Shall we hire some children for the Christmas week, just to  amuse Miss Hawberk?</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. You may do anything in the world that is idiotic  and fantastical, so long as you don&rsquo;t intrude your folly upon me. When you do make  a fool of yourself you generally contrive to do the thing pleasantly. If Adela would  like some children playing about the house next week, why, she can ask them, or  you can ask them; and as long as they behave decently I shall not complain.</p>
<p>DANBY. You don&rsquo;t quite grasp my idea, Sir John. This  is not to be a question of inviting children &mdash; children out of our own set, spoilt  and pampered after the modern fashion, children who would come as guests and would  give themselves airs. No. What I propose is to hire some children &mdash; children of  respectable birth and good manners, but whose parents are poor enough to accept  the fee which your liberality may offer for the hire of their olive branches.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. My dear Danby, the notion is preposterous,  &mdash; except in St. Giles&rsquo;s, where babies are let out to beggars by the day or week,  there can be no such people.</p>
<p>DANBY. There is every kind and grade of people; but  one must know where to look for them. Do you give me permission to hire two or three  &mdash; say three &mdash; cleanly, respectable children, to assist Miss Hawberk to get through  a solitary Christmas in a lonely country house, with two old fogies like you and  me?</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. That depends. Where do you propose to find  your children? Not in the immediate neighbourhood, unless you want to make me the  laughing-stock of the parish. Amuse yourselves to your hearts&rsquo; content; but I must  beg you to leave <i>me</i> uncompromised by your  foolishness.</p>
<p>MISS HAWBERK. The Sheik is getting angry, Mr. Danby.  We had better give up your funny idea.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. NO, no, let Danby indulge his fancy. Danby&rsquo;s  fancies are always successful, however absurd they may seem to reasonable beings.</p>
<p>DANBY <i>(throwing  his head back upon the chair-cushion and laughing his joyous laugh, a laugh that  always puts other people in good spirits).</i> There spoke my noble Sheik &mdash; the  Prince of Penlyon &mdash; the man with the blood of Cornish kings in his veins. We may  have our little bit of reasonable Christmas festivity, Miss Hawberk and I, and you  won&rsquo;t mind. But how about the fee for the children? We must pay for our little mummers.  We must compensate the parents or parent for the sacrifice of Christmas pleasures  &mdash; the happy morning faces over the stockingful of toys &mdash; the glowing evening faces  round the humble fireplace, watching the chestnuts roasting on the bars. You don&rsquo;t  know what a little world of joy humble folks lose when they don&rsquo;t have their children  about them at Christmas.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. Confound the fee! Give them twenty, fifty  pounds, if you like; but don&rsquo;t talk to me of poor children. I will have no poor  children at Penlyon. Adela is quite right. They have always colds in their heads;  they don&rsquo;t know how to treat decent furniture; they would scroop the heavy chairs  on the oak floor; they would leave prints of their horrid little thumbs on my books;  and though the imprint of the human thumb may be very interesting to the detective  physiologist, I am not a student of thumbs, and I want to keep my books clean.</p>
<p>DANBY. I am not thinking of poor children in your sense  of the word. Though I am thinking of people for whom your cheque, of say fifty pounds,  would be a boon.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. Poor relations of your own, I suppose, Danby.  Don&rsquo;t be offended. Everybody has poor relations.</p>
<p>MISS HAWBERK. Dear Princess Romanoff-Moscova has often  told me how much she has to do for some of her German connections.</p>
<p>DANBY. You&rsquo;ve hit it. I am thinking of some poor relations.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. Good. If they have any of your blood they  are sure to be little ladies and gentlemen. Only &mdash; forgive me, Danby &mdash; poverty is  apt to be pushing. I shall write my cheque for a hundred guineas, since the little  people belong to you; but don&rsquo;t let this Christmas visit be the thin end of the  wedge. Don&rsquo;t let me hear any more of the little dears, unless I myself wish it.</p>
<p>DANBY. You shall see them and hear of them no more after  old Christmas Day, unless at your own desire. Remember it is not a visit. It is  a transaction. You hire these little creatures for your amusement &mdash; our amusement  if you like &mdash; just as you would hire a conjuror for a juvenile party. You pay them  their fee, and you have done with them.</p>
<p>SIR JOHN. That is as it should be.</p>
<p>SIR John walks across the room to his desk, lights a  candle, and writes his cheque, payable to Horatio Danby for one hundred guineas,  while two footmen are bringing in lamps and afternoon tea.</p>
<p>DANBY <i>(folding  up the cheque).</i> Miss Hawberk, did I not rightly call your uncle a prince?</p>
<p>(The scene closes.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter1"></a>Chapter 1</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/Chap01.jpg" width="425" height="350" alt="chap01"></p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon was generally described by his friends  as a man of peculiar temper. He was not a bad-tempered man &mdash; indeed, he had a certain  princely graciousness which overlooked small offences. He was not easily made angry;  but, on the other hand, when deeply offended, he was vindictive, and nursed his  wrath from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, refusing ever again to touch the hand of the  offender. He had reigned at Penlyon as a lord of the soil ever since he left the&nbsp; university, coming into his own at three and twenty  years of age. He had married late, married a very young woman, dowerless, but of  good birth, who loved him far better than he ever believed during her lifetime.  She died when the younger of her two daughters was only six years old, and it was  some years after she had been laid at rest in the family vault of the Penlyons that  Sir John found an old diary hidden in a secret drawer at the back of the secretaire  in his wife&rsquo;s dressing-room; a girlish diary, written at intervals; a record of  thoughts and feelings rather than of the facts and occupations of daily life; a  record which told the widower how fondly he had been beloved, and how many a careless  wound he had inflicted upon that tender creature whose gentle countenance was hidden  from his sight for ever.</p>
<p>The reading of his wife&rsquo;s journal left in Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s  mind the burden of a lasting remorse. He had believed that when the daughter of  an impoverished house, his junior by twenty years, had accepted his stately offer  of marriage, she had been influenced as much by questions of convenience as he himself  had been. He was marrying because the time had come when he ought to marry, unless  he wanted to sink into hopeless bachelorhood and loneliness. She was marrying because  marriage with a magnate in the land would give her fortune and position. Fixed in  this notion of an equality of indifference, he had been studiously polite and kind  to his young wife; but he had never taken the trouble to sound the depths of that  girlish heart. He had taken everything for granted.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page035.jpg" width="461" height="750" alt="page035"></h3>
<p>There had been a domestic disappointment, too, in his  married life, calm and undisturbed as it was. Two daughters had been born at Penlyon Castle, but no son. And Sir John Penlyon  ardently longed for a son. His chief motive in marrying at over forty years of age  was the desire of a son and heir. He was angry at the thought that a distant cousin  should ever bear his title, and come to reign at Penlyon. The estate was strictly  entailed, and that second cousin, a soldier in a line regiment, must needs succeed  if Sir John died without leaving a son.</p>
<p>The diary reminded him of many sins; reminded him how  cold and unloving he had been to those baby daughters. The mother&rsquo;s girlish handwriting  had put every little slight on record; not in anger, but in sorrow. The widower  came upon such entries as this: &ldquo;I think it must be because he does not care for  me that he is so neglectful of Lilian. Every one says she is a lovely child. It  can&rsquo;t be because I am fond of her that I think her so beautiful. The servants all  worship her. Mr. Danby adores her, and she adores him. I couldn&rsquo;t help crying the  other day &mdash; I had to run out of the room, or I should have made an absolute fool  of myself before my husband &mdash; when I saw Mr. Danby playing with her, going on his  hands and knees under the billiard-table to play at bo-peep with her, just as if  he had been her father; while Sir John sat reading his paper at the other end of  the room, and only looked up once, to complain of the noise &mdash; Lilian&rsquo;s sweet little  silvery laugh! How could he call that a noise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this: &ldquo;I took Sibyl to the library yesterday morning  when her father was sitting there alone. It was her birthday &mdash; her third birthday  &mdash; and I thought I might presume upon that. I opened the door a little way and looked  in. He was sitting at his desk writing. I ought to have waited till he was disengaged.  I whispered to her to go to him and give him a big birthday kiss, and she ran in,  toddling across the room in her pretty blue shoes, so busy, so happy, and she caught  hold of his arm as he wrote, and lifted herself up on tiptoe, and said, &lsquo;Papa, big  birsday tiss,&rsquo; in her funny little baby talk. He put down his pen, and he stooped  down to kiss her; but a moment after he rang his spring bell, two or three times,  and called out, &lsquo;What is this child doing here, roaming about the house alone? Where  is her nurse?&rsquo; He was very kind and polite when he looked round and saw me standing  at the door, and when I begged his pardon for having disturbed him; but I could  see that he was bored, and I took Sibyl away directly. We met Mr. Danby in the corridor  with an armful of toys. What a useful good soul he is, and how sorry I shall be  when he has left us to go to the Duchess at Endsleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were many entries of the same nature &mdash; womanly  regrets, recorded again and again. &ldquo;&lsquo;I wonder why he married me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder whether he once loved somebody very  dearly and couldn&rsquo;t marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think there must be some reason for his not caring  for me. I ought not to complain, even to this stupid old book &mdash; but the book is  like an old friend. I sit staring at my name and the date, written by my old governess  at the Manor House, and recalling those careless, thoughtless days when my sisters  and I used to think our Ollendorff exercises the worst troubles we had in this world  &mdash; before mother began to be an invalid &mdash; before father used to confide all his difficulties  to us girls &mdash; the debts, the tenants that wouldn&rsquo;t pay, the roofs that wanted new  slating. Oh, how long ago it all seems! I have no money troubles now. Father has  had legacies, and everything is going smoothly at home. And yet I feel sometimes  as if my heart were slowly turning to ice.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Break, thou deep vase of chilling tears, <br>
That time has shaken into frost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon never forgot the reading of that diary.  He remembered the very day and hour when looking for a missing list of family jewels  &mdash; jewels which his dead wife had worn on state occasions, and which were to go back  to the bank, and to lie in darkness, like her who had worn them &mdash; he had come upon  that old German copy-book, rolled up and thrust far back in the secret drawer, tied  with a shabby old ribbon. He remembered sitting by the tireless hearth, in the prettily  furnished dressing-room, disused since his wife&rsquo;s death. He remembered the dull  grey autumn sky, and the rain drifting across the leaden sea, and the shags standing  on the rocks, drenched and drooping, all nature in low spirits.</p>
<p>The reading of that record of unhappiness, so meekly  borne, was not without one good result. Sir John took more notice of his two girls  than he had ever done in their mother&rsquo;s lifetime. Sibyl, the younger, contrived  more particularly to find her way into his heart, She was stronger and more vivacious  than her elder sister. She was full of daring, a romp, and a tomboy. Lilian was  like her mother, and was gentle, and shrinking, and subdued as her mother had been  in the presence of the husband she loved and feared. Sibyl had a nature unacquainted  with fear; and her father fancied he saw in her all the highest qualities of the  Penlyons &mdash; beauty, strength, courage.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page043.jpg" width="565" height="750" alt="page043"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;If she had but been a boy,&rdquo; he sometimes said to himself,  with a profound sigh.</p>
<p>It seemed a hard thing that such a splendid creature  must needs be cheated out of the heritage of her father and grandfather, and of  many generations before them, only because she happened to be a daughter instead  of a son. The Penlyon estate had been growing in wealth and importance while all  those generations of the past were growing from youth to age, through life to death.  The Penlyons had developed a great mining district, far off yonder southward towards  Truro. They had  added farm to farm between Boscastle and Bodmin. Everything had prospered with this  proud and ancient race: and from Launceston to Tintagel and Tintagel to Bude there  was no such family as the Penlyons of Penlyon Castle.</p>
<p>Sir John was foolishly indulgent to his motherless daughters  during the first four or five years of his widowhood, making amends to them for  all that had been wanting in his conduct to their mother. His remorse was not for  sins of commission, but for sins of omission. He knew that he had not been unkind  to his wife. He had only failed to understand her. The poor little diary in the  German exercise book had told him how dearly he had been beloved, and how dull and  ungrateful he had been.</p>
<p>For nearly five years after his wife&rsquo;s death Sir John  lived at Penlyon Castle,  managed his estates, hunted and shot, and in summer did a little yachting along  that wild north coast, and southward by Penzance and Falmouth, and as far as the Start Point. In all  those five years he had his two children much about him, took them on his yacht,  taught them to ride, and was enraptured with the pluck and the endurance shown by  the younger, whether on sea or land. She rode a pony that her elder sister dared  not mount. Her father took her with him when he went out with the harriers, and  she rode up and down those wild hills with a dash and cleverness that enchanted  the squires and farmers of the district.</p>
<p>During all this time the girls were in a manner running-wild.  They had a nursery governess to look after them whose authority was of the smallest,  and who soon came to understand that Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s daughters were to do as  they liked; and that both learning and elegant accomplishments counted for very  little at Penlyon   Castle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look after their health, Miss Peterson, and see that  they change their shoes when they come in from walking,&rdquo; said Sir John. &ldquo;All the  rest is leather and prunella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Peterson, who had never read Pope, took this for  an allusion to the shoes.</p>
<p>The two girls would have got the better of their governess  in any case; but Sir John being avowedly on the side of ignorance, the poor young  lady had no chance of making them take kindly to education. They loved the gardens  and the hills and the wild sea-beach, and those narrow walks which looked to Miss  Peterson like mere ledges on the face of the cliff, and where she could hardly stand  for a minute without feeling giddy. They were strong and bold, and free in every  movement of their young limbs, while she was London-bred, a weakling, and a very  bad walker. Her feet used to ache on those grand moorland roads, and her poor sick  soul long for a Royal Blue, or any other friendly omnibus, to take her in and carry  her homewards. She was one of those people who say they are very fond of the country  in summer. The breezy October days, the white mists of winter, filled her with sadness  and dejection.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page049.jpg" width="540" height="750" alt="page049"></h3>
<p>The two little girls were kind to her after their free-and-easy  fashion; but they treated her with a good-natured contempt, She was afraid of a  horse; she was afraid of the sea; she was afraid of being blown off the cliff when  the wind was high; and she could not walk two miles without feeling tired. She confessed  to being troubled with corns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Peterson has corns,&rdquo; cried Sibyl; &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t it funny?  I thought it was only old people who had corns,&rdquo;</p>
<p>This free-and-easy life went on for five years. The  children throve and grew apace &mdash; did what they liked, ate what they liked, and were  as idle as they liked. The effect of this indulgence upon their physical health  was all that the fondest father could desire. The doctor from Boscastle complained  laughingly that the Penlyon nursery wasn&rsquo;t worth a five-pound note to him from year&rsquo;s  end to year&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never have anything the matter with you,&rdquo; he said,  as the children skipped round him in the road, fond of him in their small way, as  one of the funny personages of the district.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I have earned seven and sixpence out  of either of you since I lanced your gums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lance my gums?&rdquo; cried Sibyl. &ldquo;How funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think it funny then, I can tell you.&rdquo; said  the doctor, grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I? What&rsquo;s it like? Lance them now,&rdquo; said Sibyl,  curling up her red lips and opening her mouth very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you. You&rsquo;d bite. You look as if you could  bite!&rdquo; laughed the doctor. &ldquo;I tell you what it is, I believe Miss Peterson is a  witch &mdash; one of our ancient Cornish witches who has turned herself into a nice-looking  young woman.&rdquo; Mr. Nicholls could not so far perjure himself as to say pretty. &ldquo;Miss Peterson has bewitched you both. She has charmed away the measles and the whooping-cough.  She has cheated me out of my just rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Peterson heard him with a pale smile, shifting  her weight from the more painful foot to the foot that pained her a little less.  The children went leaping and bounding along the road, the embodiment of healthy,  high-spirited childhood.</p>
<p>Sir John praised Miss Peterson for her care of them,  and rewarded her, as the school-board mistresses are rewarded, according to results;  only the results in this case were physical and not mental, and Sir John&rsquo;s Christmas  present of a silk gown or a ten-pound note was given because his daughters were  healthy and happy, rather than because they made any progress with their education.  In sober truth, they knew a little less than the village children of the same age  at the parish school.</p>
<p>At the end of those five years that pleasant life came  to an abrupt close. North Cornwall found out all at once that it could not continue  to prosper and to hold its own in the march of progress unless it were represented  by Sir John Penlyon. Radical influences were abroad in the land. The Church was  in danger, was indeed being fast pushed to the wall by the force of Dissent, its  superior in numerical strength. North Cornwall  must no longer be given over to the Radical party. It was time that a stand should  be made, and a battle should be fought. Sir John Penlyon, said the newspapers, was  the man to make that stand, and to fight that battle. He was rich; he had a stake  in the country; he was influential; he was fairly popular. He had sat in Parliament  fourteen years before for a Cornish borough that was now among the things of the  past, a sop long since flung by Conservative Reformers to the Democratic Cerberus.  He could never again sit for Blackmount, the hereditary seat of his ancestors, with  a constituency of three and twenty; but he could sit for North Cornwall, and North Cornwall claimed him for its own.</p>
<p>Perhaps Sir John Penlyon was getting tired of rusticity.  In any case he consented to be nominated in the Conservative interest; and the result  of the contest was a triumph for the good old family and the good old cause. Sir  John took a small house in Queen Anne&rsquo;s Gate, gave himself up to politics, and almost  deserted his Cornish domain. Except for a month or six weeks in the autumn, he was  scarcely seen in the West during the seven years that followed his election as Member  for the Western Division of North Cornwall. He was re-elected during those seven  years without opposition, for it was now felt that the Western Division had become  a pocket-borough of the Penlyons, just as Blackmount had been. There was no use  in fighting Sir John Penlyon in his stronghold of the west.</p>
<p>Before settling himself in his comfortable bachelor  quarters by St. James&rsquo;s Park, Sir John invited his only sister, Mrs. Hawberk, to  Penlyon Place,  with a view to taking counsel with her as to the education of his daughters. The  time had doubtless come when Lilian and Sibyl must cease to run wild. Mrs. Hawberk&rsquo;s  husband was the younger son of a peer, and she gave herself some airs on the strength  of that connection. She was very fond of talking of Allerton, the family seat, where  she usually spent a somewhat dismal six weeks in September and October while her  husband was going about the country speaking at political meetings, and wearing  himself out, as he declared, in support of the cause.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawberk came. She had not seen her nieces since  their mother&rsquo;s death. She took them in hand at once in a masterful way; and after  spending a single afternoon with them and their governess, she informed her brother  that his children were monsters of ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sooner you get rid of that young woman the better,&rdquo;  she said of poor Miss Peterson, who had done all in her power to make herself agreeable  to the great lady. &ldquo;She has taught them nothing, and she has not the slightest authority  over them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has looked after their health,&rdquo; replied Sir John,  apologizing for the governess&rsquo;s shortcomings, &ldquo;and they are very fond of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One wouldn&rsquo;t wish them to be fond of her. It is a very  bad sign when children are fond of their governess. It means that she spoils them  and allows them to be idle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have been idle at my desire. I told Miss Peterson  to cultivate their bodies and leave their minds alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has obeyed you to the letter. I never met with  such ignorant children. They pretend to be fond of flowers, yet they know no more  of botany than my maid Rogers. They have made no progress with the piano. They know  no French. They are backward in everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are splendid children,&rdquo; said Sir John, doggedly.  </p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; and if you allow them to grow up with Miss Peterson they will be splendid  savages; and you will be put to shame by them when they go into society. It does  not do for girls to be ignorant and unaccomplished nowadays. You will want them  to marry well, I suppose, by-and-by?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t want them to marry badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Of course not; and to make good  matches they will have to be accomplished as well as good-looking. They are very  sweet girls,&rdquo; added Mrs. Hawberk, not wishing to offend her only brother, and a  wealthy brother; &ldquo;but they have been dreadfully indulged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted them to be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they have had a fine time of it. You were  not so weak about them in their poor mother&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I wish I had been a little weaker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Mary would have liked me to take more notice  of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, John; you were perfect in your conduct to  poor Mary. No young woman could have had a more chivalrous husband. I hope you don&rsquo;t  reproach yourself for having been wanting in any respect towards poor Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we needn&rsquo;t talk about that, Nobody can mend the  past, I want you to do what is best for the girls now I am to be so much in London. If Miss Peterson is  not governess enough for them she must have a superior person to help her. She can  stay to look after their health, and see that they change their shoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear John, a maid will do all that. If you want  me to be of use to them you must let me have a free hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; you shall have a free hand for the next  five years, till they have finished their education. Lilian is nearly thirteen.  Five years hence she will be old enough to enter society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it shall be my care that she is fitted for her  position as your eldest daughter,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawberk, decisively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sir John went to London, and left Mrs. Hawberk mistress of the  field. She began her work of reform by dismissing meek little Miss Peterson, who  was so much afraid of her that she was almost glad to go; yes, even to exchange  the fleshpots of Penlyon Castle for the meagre fare of a lodging in Camden Town.  Miss Peterson loved her pupils, and wept at parting from them; but the scornful  domination of the fashionable lady had cowed her spirits. She cried bitterly on  the last morning at the Castle, but found few words to express either her love or  her sorrow.</p>
<p>Sibyl, the impulsive one, clung round Miss Peterson&rsquo;s  neck, and abused her aunt for sending this faithful friend away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall hate the new governess, and I shall always  love you,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, you mustn&rsquo;t hate any one. We have been very  happy together, and I hope some day Sir John will let me see you and Lilian again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let you see us!&rdquo; exclaimed Sibyl; &ldquo;I should think so,  indeed! You shall come and live with me again the minute I am grown up. <i>She</i> will have no power over us then.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>She</i> was Mrs. Hawberk, who had not  left her room at this early hour. The carriage was at the door to take Miss Peterson  to the coach, and the coach was to take her to the station at Launceston, whence  it would be a long, long journey to Camden   Town.</p>
<p>Lilian and Sibyl had packed a picnic basket for her  with provisions that would have lasted for a week if the train had been snowed up  on the moorland above Okehampton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go to Victoria  with you,&rdquo; cried Sibyl.</p>
<p>Victoria was the point where the coach  stopped to pick up passengers from Penlyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my darling, your aunt wouldn&rsquo;t like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Sibyl jumped into the carriage before the sentence  was finished. The footman shut the door, and the coachman drove off. There was no  time to spare, if the coach was to swallow up poor little Miss Peterson that morning.</p>
<p>The coach did swallow her; and Sibyl, without either  hat or jacket, alighted from the brougham half an hour afterwards to find her aunt  standing in the porch awaiting her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the most undisciplined child I ever had to  do with,&rdquo; said Mrs. Hawberk.</p>
<p>The new governess arrived three days after Miss Peterson&rsquo;s  departure. She, too, was young in years; but she was old in culture and accomplishments.  She was a model governess. She had taken prizes and certificates, and had passed  examinations of all kinds. She was strong in mathematics and in natural science.  She knew a respectable amount of Latin, and had a useful smattering of Greek &mdash; enough  to make her oppressively erudite about the derivation of words. Sibyl and Lilian  began by hating her, and though hatred soon simmered down to toleration, they never  became fond of her. She had indifferent health, and suffered from neuralgic headaches;  and indeed it seemed as if she introduced headaches into Penlyon Place, for her  pupils very soon began to suffer from aching temples, and to look dark and heavy  about the eyes, and to lose those fine appetites for indiscriminate food which they  had enjoyed under the Peterson <i>r&eacute;gime, </i>in  the old happy time when they used to go down to dessert every evening and sit on  each side of their father, and eat as much fruit and cake, chow-chow, guava jelly,  and preserved pine-apple as ever they liked, while Sir John nibbled an olive or  two, and sipped his claret.</p>
<p>Neuralgia and headache reigned at Penlyon; and the two  girls grew white and wan, like their all-accomplished governess; and Mr. Nicholls,  the family doctor, had no longer to complain of the rude health of the Miss Penlyons.  He had plenty of visits booked against Penlyon Place at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Just at the time when Lilian and Sibyl were growing  fastest, running up from stout, chubby children, into thin slips of girls; just  when their constitutions most needed rest, and liberty, and pleasant exercise in  the open air &mdash; riding, tennis, walking, rowing, romping &mdash; this burden of education  was laid upon them. They were reminded every day that they had been neglected, and  that they were to make amends for lost time by extra application. They were crammed  with &rsquo;ologies from which not one young woman out of a hundred ever derives the faintest  pleasure or advantage in after-life. They were made to sit at the piano, tap, tap,  tapping the notes, first with one finger and then with another, in monotonous five-finger  exercises &mdash; the athletics of piano practice, Miss Gambert called this heart-sickening  drudgery. Even the music they played as a relief from the five-finger tapping was  of a dry and learned order which aroused no interest in their minds &mdash; a &ldquo;sad, mechanic  exercise,&rdquo; and no more. Their only pleasure at the piano was found in stolen minutes,  when Miss Gambert was out of ear-shot, when Sibyl, whose ear was of the quickest,  picked out music-hall tunes, which she had heard gardeners or stable-boys whistling  at their work. Music-hall ditties that catch the fancy of city and suburbs will  travel even as far west as Tintagel.</p>
<p>Mr. Nicholls remonstrated with the governess upon the  subject of over-much study, and had even the audacity to argue the point with Mrs.  Hawberk herself, on one of her half-yearly visits to Penlyon Place.</p>
<p>That lady laughed his arguments to scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got beyond that old-fashioned idea of brain-work  being bad for the constitution, my good Mr. Nicholls. Look at judges, bishops, famous  physicians, some of the longest-lived men on record. My nieces are like all girls  of their age, fanciful and rather affected. Miss Gambert is giving them a sound  and solid education, which will make them valuable members of society; and here  you come with your old-fashioned fads about overwork and mental strain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only tell you, madam, that these dear young ladies  have deteriorated in health since Miss Peterson left&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Peterson! She was a favourite of yours, evidently,  doctor,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Hawberk, with a sneer which brought an indignant blush  to the cheeks and forehead of the bachelor doctor, who had never given Miss Peterson  so much as a thought in the way of gallantry. &ldquo;Come, Mr. Nicholls, in spite of your  worship of ignorance, I think you will admit that any deterioration in my nieces  is the effect of over-growth, and that it is natural for girls of their age to be  weak and weedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mrs. Hawberk, and that weak and weedy age is just  the period at which the educational strain should be relaxed. However, I can but  submit to your superior wisdom, and hope that with the help of tonics and a strengthening  diet the young ladies may regain the ground lost in the last year or so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give them as many tonics as you like; only don&rsquo;t interfere  with the cultivation of their minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawberk took her own way in this as in every other  matter in which she was given what she called a free hand. She had an invincible  belief in her own wisdom, and in the foolishness of almost everybody else. She drove  Miss Gambert, and Miss Gambert drove her pupils, and Lilian Penlyon at eighteen  years of age was certainly a very well read and accomplished young woman, only it  was a pity that she should be so weak and weedy, and consumptive-looking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her poor mother&rsquo;s constitution,&rdquo; Mrs. Hawberk said  decisively, when Sir John lamented his daughter&rsquo;s delicate health.</p>
<p>Lilian made her <i>d&eacute;but</i> in society, chaperoned by her aunt, from a fine house in the best part of Cromwell Road, while  Sibyl stayed at Penlyon, and went on grinding at the dry-as-dust books, and the  learned German music, which the most advanced educational authorities had prescribed  for the cultivation of youthful minds. Lilian went everywhere, and was admired for  her delicate beauty and the shy dignity of her manners, and her unlikeness to other  girls. She had grown up in solitude, and the slang of other girls was a language  unknown to her, and the ways of other girls were foreign to her mind. She was very  much admired for these superior qualities, and it was not forgotten that she was  joint heiress of Sir John Penlyon, the wealthy Cornishman, whose mines and slate  quarries were known to yield a large revenue, without counting his extensive landed  estate, the greater part of which unhappily was included in the entail, and would  go to the heir-at-law. Before Lilian had been out three months Mrs. Hawberk had  the triumph of informing her brother that Lord Lurgrave, the Earl of Holmsley&rsquo;s  son, had proposed to his elder daughter, and only waited his permission to consider  himself formally engaged to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Lilian like the young man?&rdquo; Sir John asked briefly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it is quite a romantic attachment on both  sides.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let them marry,&rdquo; said Sir John; &ldquo;the sooner the  better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did everything in his power to facilitate the marriage.  The young man was a good young man. Nobody had any charge to bring against him;  and his father, Lord Holmsley, was well placed in the world, and stood well with  the world. The alliance was altogether honourable; and Miss Penlyon was thought  to have done well for herself in her first season.</p>
<p>Sir John had his own reasons for hurrying on the marriage,  reasons which he told to nobody. More than once during the years of his widowhood  he had been on the point of taking a second wife, and at the eleventh hour, on the  eve of proposing to a lady whom he thought inclined to favour his suit, he had drawn  back. No, he had married once without love, and he had not made his wife happy.  He would not enter upon a second loveless union in the hope of an heir to his estate.  Long ago, in his early manhood, he had loved, and he had been balked in his love,  which had been bestowed upon one who was his inferior in birth and social status.  He had loved a farmer&rsquo;s daughter, and had wanted to make her his wife, setting all  social distinctions at nought for her dear sake. But he had given her up at his  father&rsquo;s bidding, and at her own entreaty. She loved him too well to make bad blood  between father and son, All this had happened nearly forty years ago, but it had  influenced the whole of Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s after life. He made up his mind that  there should be no second loveless union for him, and he looked forward to seeing  his grandchildren grow up about him. He could not give Penlyon Place or the lands of Penlyon to his  daughter&rsquo;s son. Those must go to the heir-at-law; but he might bequeath the accumulations  of long years, and the quarries and mines which he himself had bought. He had never  spent more than a third of his income.</p>
<p>When he went down to the west in October he found Mrs.  Hawberk established there before him, superintending all the domestic arrangements  for the marriage. The wedding clothes were being made in London. All that Sir John had to do was to agree  with Lord Holmsley&rsquo;s lawyers about the settlement. The wedding was fixed for the  fifteenth of November. The settlement was liberal, but if Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s daughter  were to die childless, her fortune would revert to her father, and young Lord Lurgrave  would have nothing. This point was insisted upon by Sir John&rsquo;s lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happily the young lady&rsquo;s death is a remote contingency,&rdquo;  said Lord Holmsley, when his own lawyer objected to the clause.</p>
<p>Sir John found the lovers very happy, and Penlyon Place in a pleasant  bustle of expectation. He found Sibyl still grinding on at science and history,  and more &rsquo;ologies than he himself had ever heard of, a university education in his  day not having recognized the &rsquo;ologies. He found her pale and thin, and disguised  in smoke-coloured spectacles, which she had taken to wearing because the light hurt  her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor pretty Sibyl, how they have changed you!&rdquo; exclaimed  Sir John.</p>
<p>His younger daughter, once so daring in her merriment,  so frankly demonstrative in her affection, was now shy and restrained in her manner  to her father. He had seen a good deal of Lilian in the London season; and the ice had been broken between  them. Lilian was almost the Lilian of old. But Sibyl was completely changed; and  though Mrs. Hawberk assured him that the change was an improvement, he could not  help regretting the old Sibyl, the frank and fearless companion, the spirited young  horsewoman, the sunburnt, bronze-haired girl who could handle oar or boat-hook with  the best of the lads of Boscastle. He saw her at her studies in the library every  morning; he heard her play erudite German music after dinner in the drawingroom.  He saw her and Miss Gambert setting out every afternoon for their constitutional  walk on the moors, and riding home in the dusk one evening he saw them pacing the  windblown road with Mr. Morland, the High Church curate, in attendance. He questioned  Sibyl about the curate when she had played her newest mazurka and was bidding him  good-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything between Miss Gambert and Morland?&rdquo;  he asked. &ldquo;Is he paying his addresses to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph; I began to suspect something when I saw him walking  with you two this afternoon. He is a very good fellow, though his father is only  a grocer in a small way of business in Plymouth.  She might do worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is very good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was all. Sibyl touched her father&rsquo;s cheek with  a faint fluttering kiss and retired, leaving the room in the quiet manner which  Miss Gambert had impressed upon her as the proper manner for a young lady belonging  to one of the county families.</p>
<p>Miss Penlyon&rsquo;s wedding was a very smart wedding, or  as smart as a wedding can be in the wilds of Cornwall. She had a bishop to marry her, assisted  by a High Church archdeacon, and by Mr. Morland, curate of the parish &mdash; Mr. Morland,  who was a pale, thin young man with large blue eyes and a short, nervous cough,  and who was nearer Rome in all his thoughts and aspirations than the archdeacon.</p>
<p>Lilian Penlyon was as graceful and dignified a bride  as any one could desire to see; and Mrs. Hawberk prided herself upon the result  of her wise administration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are satisfied with your daughters to-day,  John,&rdquo; she said, swelling with conscious merit, her matronly form seeming larger  than usual in the amplitude of a brand new velvet gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are looking very handsome; but I wish they did  not look so fragile,&rdquo; replied Sir John, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood, my dear John, blood. You wouldn&rsquo;t expect a racer  to show the bulk and bone of a carthorse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the wedding was over, and Lilian and her husband  were travelling in Italy on a  wedding tour which was to last till the spring, life at Penlyon Castle  dropped back into the old grooves; and the old grooves meant books and piano and  drawing-board, varied only by the dull constitutional walk or the duller drive.  The winter skies in that western land were clear and bright, and a few stray flowers  lingered here and there in the shelter of the hills, as if winter had forgotten  them; but the landscape in all its poetic beauty was a melancholy landscape for  the afternoon eyes of a girl, whose long laborious mornings were given to dry books  and drier music, and to convincing herself with strenuous toil that she had no talent  for painting.</p>
<p>The daily walk was insisted upon by doctor and governess;  so Miss Penlyon was marched out in fair weather or foul, and had to tramp submissively  for at least four miles, sometimes buffeted by the wind and the spray, sometimes  moving ghost-like in a grey mist of rain.</p>
<p>Mr. Morland, the curate, often joined governess and  pupil in these afternoon walks. He had nothing to say about the world of men, but  he had lived and had his being from boyhood upwards in a little world of books,  and about these he was eloquent. Carlyle, Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Shelley,  Keats &mdash; these were his gods, and he would quote them and talk of them for an hour  at a stretch.</p>
<p>To Sibyl, who had been reared upon hard facts strictly  on the Gradgrind principle, the world of philosophy and poetry was a revelation.  She explored her father&rsquo;s library, and in a corner among the very refuse of the  shelves found a shabby old volume of Shelley, printed in Paris; and this treasure  she carried off to her bedroom and kept under her pillow and pored over in secret,  marking <i>his</i> favourite passages and learning  them by rote; so that one day, half unconsciously, she took up the line where Mr.  Morland stopped, and went on to the end of the stanza, &ldquo;I hope you found those lines  in a book of selections,&rdquo; said Miss Gambert. &ldquo;I am sure your aunt would disapprove  of Shelley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may disapprove, but I&rsquo;m sure she never read him,&rdquo;  answered Sibyl. &ldquo;Lilian told me that she never reads anything but the tradesmen&rsquo;s  books, and that she pores over them every Tuesday morning in a maddening manner,  and then has awful talks with her housekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawberk is a very clever woman and an admirable  manager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say she is; but she need not parade her butcher&rsquo;s  book. She has a pile of horrid tradesmen&rsquo;s books on the breakfast table, and looks  over them as she eats her breakfast. I call it absolutely indecent. Lilian said  it made her hate Tuesday mornings. She used to wonder if aunt thought she made too  much difference in the weekly bills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Hawberk has ample means, and keeps a liberal table;  but she abhors waste, as all sensible women do,&rdquo; said the governess, reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she parades her butcher&rsquo;s book when I am in the  Cromwell Road  I shall say something rude to her,&rdquo; retorted Sibyl; &ldquo;but I hope Lilian will be in  town in the spring, and then she will be able to chaperon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking forward eagerly to the spring, when  you will have left Cornwall,&rdquo;  said Mr. Morland, pensively; and then there came a silence upon Sibyl and the curate,  and Miss Gambert did all the talking during the homeward walk.</p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon went back to London soon after Christmas, and politics claimed  him for their own. He had arranged with his sister that Sibyl was to make her <i>debut</i> from the Cromwell Road as Lilian had done. Lady Lurgrave,  even if she were to have a house in town, which was doubtful, would be too young  and inexperienced a matron to take charge of her sister. She would not have the  firmness of will needed to keep younger sons at bay; she would be too good-natured  and easy in her treatment of detrimentals: altogether Sir John felt that his sister  would be the only competent chaperon for Sibyl, whom he always thought of as wild  and difficult to manage, remembering how rash and wilful she had been in those childish  years, when she rode the piebald pony, and insisted upon going faster at ditches  and hedges than her father thought safe for so juvenile a performer. She had been  headstrong and disobedient in those days; but he had loved her for her high spirits  and daring. Now on the threshold of womanhood she was obedient enough to please  the most exacting parent. Mrs. Hawberk and Miss Gambert between them had succeeded  in taming her; but perhaps Sir John hardly liked this younger daughter of his quite  so well after that careful training as he had liked her in her childhood, when she  had been as wild and sweet as a dog-rose and as full of thorns. Mrs. Hawberk, however,  took credit to herself for having produced the most perfect thing in young ladies;  and Sir John felt that he ought to be grateful.</p>
<p>He really did feel grateful to this clever sister of  his for having taken all his paternal responsibilities off his shoulders and left  him free to attend to the affairs of the nation &mdash; very grateful, until one foggy  afternoon in February when a telegram was brought to him in the library at the Carlton, where he was writing  his letters.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;To Sir John Penlyon.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Sibyl left the castle at seven this morning. She has  been traced as far as Bodmin-road Station; supposed to have gone to Bristol. I am in the greatest  distress of mind. Pray tell me what I am to do.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;GAMBERT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does the woman mean?&rdquo; Sir John asked himself,  staring at the words in the telegram. &ldquo;Sibyl must have quarrelled with her, and  is on her way to London,  meaning no doubt to come to her aunt or to me. Bristol is all nonsense &mdash; a mistake of the porters  or of the servant who followed her to Bodmin. A foolish, troublesome business &mdash;  just now, too, with this amendment coming on to-night, and when I am so full of  work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at his watch. Half-past two. The train from  Bodmin would arrive at Paddington soon after four. He must be on the platform, of  course, to receive this foolish daughter. It was very wrong of her &mdash; a vein of the  old Adam cropping up in the regenerate Sibyl. Who would have thought her capable  of such rebellion?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seemed so tame and well broken when I was at Penlyon,&rdquo;  mused Sir John, &ldquo;but no doubt that middle-aged young lady with the spectacles and  the scraggy shoulders is rather a trying person to live with, in a country house,  through a long winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on writing his letters till there was only just  time to get to Paddington, allowing a widish margin for the fog &mdash; before the fast  train from the far west came in. If the train also had not been delayed by the fog,  Sir John would not have been there to see its arrival.</p>
<p>He was there, walking up and down the platform, watchful  and on the alert, until the last cab had driven away with the last passenger and  the last portmanteau; but among all those passengers there was no daughter of his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;l am a fool,&rdquo; he said to himself; &ldquo;she may have got  out at Westbourne   Park.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took another cab and had himself driven slowly through  the thickening fog across the park to South Kensington and the fine large house  in the Cromwell Road,  from which Sibyl was to take a header into London society.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawberk was sitting alone in the subdued lamplight  of the back drawing-room, the spacious front drawing-room a yawning gulf of shadows  lighted only by occasional gleams from a low fire.</p>
<p>She started from her chair as Sir John was announced,  and ran to him and fell upon his neck sobbing &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, dear John, I am so sorry for you,&rdquo; she  exclaimed gaspingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Clara? What has happened? Has Sibyl  come to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me, poor blind, deluded girl! Come to me? Oh,  John, haven&rsquo;t you heard? Didn&rsquo;t you receive poor Miss Gambert&rsquo;s second telegram?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; cried Sir John, fiercely. &ldquo;What does it all mean?  Has there been an accident on the line? Is the girl hurt &mdash; killed?&rdquo; he asked, hoarse  with sudden terror.</p>
<p>His sister&rsquo;s tears, her agitation, her embraces were  enough to suggest direst calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Hawberk. &ldquo;No, she is safe enough.  There are some parents, perhaps, who would rather hear that she had been killed  in a railway accident than that she had so lowered herself, thrown herself away  so blindly as she has done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara, if you would be good enough to tell me in plain  words what has happened to my daughter, instead of trying to act like Madame Ristori  in <i>Medea,</i> you would do me a favour,&rdquo; said  Sir John, in his most unpleasant voice.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page081.jpg" width="600" height="518" alt="page081"></h3>
<p>Mrs. Hawberk sat down and collected herself, thinking,  as she did so, that it was in the fraternal nature to be disagreeable at every stage  of life. She remembered dimly how shamefully her brother had ill-treated her favourite  doll five and forty years before. He was the same man now &mdash; now, after she had toiled  and slaved for him, saying him all thought and care about his motherless girls.  The same man, utterly heartless and unfeeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter Sibyl was married to Mr. Morland, the  curate, at St. Sophia&rsquo;s Church, Plymouth,  this morning,&rdquo; she said with haughty indifference. &ldquo;If you haven&rsquo;t received your  own telegram, you may like to see mine.&rdquo; She waved her hand towards an occasional  table, on which lay an open telegram. Sir John snatched it up and read it eagerly,  stooping to get the light of the shaded lamp, which was intended to make darkness  visible rather than to illuminate the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The inquiries about Bristol were only a blind. She went to Plymouth with Mr. Morland,  and they were married at St. Sophia&rsquo;s, and have gone to Torquay for their honeymoon.  A telegram from him to me &mdash; letter&nbsp; to follow.  Also letter to Sir John. I think you must feel for me, dear friend, for you alone  can understand my feelings under this cruel blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a long telegram. A woman must be deeply moved  before she can be so reckless in the expenditure of words, every one of which has  to be paid for.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page083.jpg" width="600" height="550" alt="page083"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Her feelings!&rdquo; growled Sir John; &ldquo;what have her feelings  to do with my daughter&rsquo;s misconduct, except so far as she has proved herself unworthy  of being trusted with the care of a pupil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John! don&rsquo;t you know the poor thing was engaged  to Morland? He pretended to be only waiting for his first living in order to marry  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was the state of the case, was it?&rdquo; said Sir  John, with cutting coolness. &ldquo;And he thought it a better speculation to marry my  daughter. I am very sorry for him. He will find he has made a bad bargain. He would  have done better to marry the governess, for she is a bread-winner, and my daughter  will never bring him a sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, John! She has been very foolish, poor child, but  I know you will forgive her &mdash; after a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not after an eternity &mdash; if eternity could have an afterwards.  She has set me at nought, and from this hour to my last hour on earth I shall set  her at nought. It shall be to me as if she had never existed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/Chap03.jpg" width="425" height="310" alt="chap03"></p>
<p>The time, afternoon &mdash; the afternoon of Christmas Eve;  the place the library at Penlyon Castle; and the only personage Sir John Penlyon,  sitting by the fire in the gathering dusk, somewhat out of temper with the world  at large, and with himself as the most important member in it. The morning had been  troublesome, spent for the most part with his bailiff, who was full of the wants  and the shortcomings of tenants. Sir John had missed his useful friend Danby, and  that philosophical spirit which always made light of such thorns in the flower-bed  of a rich man&rsquo;s lot, and always succeeded in laughing him out of his bad temper.</p>
<p>Mr. Danby had been absent for the last four days.</p>
<p>He had gone, with Sir John&rsquo;s cheque in his pocket, to  fetch the Christmas hirelings; the little people who were to come to the dull old  castle and make merriment for its solitary lord.</p>
<p>The more Sir John Penlyon meditated upon the business,  especially this afternoon, the more preposterous and vexatious it seemed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have been an arrant fool to consent to such  a piece of folly,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>Enter Adela Hawberk, flushed and excited.</p>
<p>Adela. We have finished, uncle <i>(clapping her hands). </i>It is quite the prettiest tree you ever saw. How  delighted the dear little things will be!</p>
<p>Sir John (<i>testily).</i> Dear little things, indeed! How do you know they mayn&rsquo;t be odious little things,  spoilt and cantankerous, or underbred and hypocritical, if they have been what a  middle-class mother calls &ldquo;well brought up&rdquo; &mdash; brought up to sit upon the edge of  their chair, and to be afraid of everybody?</p>
<p>Adela <i>(with conviction).</i> They are sure to be nice children. Mr. Danby wouldn&rsquo;t bring nasty ones.</p>
<p>Sir John. What does he know about children &mdash; an old  bachelor?</p>
<p>Adela. Why, uncle, you can&rsquo;t have seen him in a children&rsquo;s  party, or you&rsquo;d never say that. He is a prodigious favourite with the children in  all the houses he goes to. Perhaps that is one reason why the mothers are so fond  of him. Hark! They ought to be here by this time. The carriage went to Victoria an hour ago to meet  the coach from Launceston. They were to stay at Plymouth last night. Mr. Danby thought it would  be too long a journey for the little things to do in one day. He is so considerate.</p>
<p>Sir John. He is a fool; and I am a greater fool to encourage  his nonsense. The utter absurdity of bringing children from the other end of the  world! Do you know where the creatures come from, Adela?</p>
<p>Adela. I haven&rsquo;t the faintest notion. All Mr. Danby  said was that they lived on the other side of London, and that he wanted a clear week to fetch  them. You must remember, uncle, you told him you wanted to know nothing about them.  They were to come and go, and you were to hear no more of them. They were to have  no claim upon you in the future.</p>
<p>Sir John. I should think not, indeed. Claim upon me,  forsooth! But it would have been only civil to tell me where the brats come from,  and who their people are.</p>
<p>Adela. No doubt he will tell you, if you ask him.</p>
<p>Sir John. He ought to have told me of his own accord.  I am not going to ask him.</p>
<p>Adela was discreetly silent, seeing that her uncle was  in what she called one of his tempers. She always respected her uncle&rsquo;s tempers.</p>
<p>She went to the big bay window from which she could  see a long way down the drive. It was not four o&rsquo;clock, but the dimness of a wintry  twilight was creeping over the landscape. The afternoon was mild and calm, by no  means an old-fashioned Christmas, an afternoon that might have been October. She  could hear a faint sighing of the wind in the trees near at hand, and the roaring  of the waves far off, not a stormy roar, only the rhythmical rise and swell of the  great Atlantic rolling over the stony beach.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page089.jpg" width="449" height="750" alt="page089"></h3>
<p>Everything had been made ready for the little strangers. There were fires blazing in two large bedrooms overhead;  rooms with a door of communication. In one there were still the two little white  beds in which Lilian and Sibyl had slept when they were children; poor Lilian, whose  bed was in the English cemetery at Florence,  under a white marble monument erected by her sorrowing husband, and whose sorrowing  husband had taken to himself a second wife five years ago. Every one knew where  Lilian was lying; but no one at Penlyon Castle knew where Sibyl&rsquo;s head had found  rest. All that people knew about the disobedient daughter was that her husband had  died within three or four years of her marriage, worn to death in some foreign mission,  after toiling for a year or so at the east end of London. Of his luckless widow  no one at Penlyon had heard anything, but it was surmised that her father made her  an allowance. He could hardly let his only daughter starve, people said, however  badly she might have treated him. Lady Lurgrave&rsquo;s early death had been a crushing  blow to his love and to his pride. She had died childless.</p>
<p>The rooms were ready. Adela ran upstairs to take a final  survey. One of the housemaids had been told off to wait upon the little strangers;  and Adela&rsquo;s maid was to give a hand. Neither of these young women had any objection  to the extra duty. Each professed herself fond of children.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll enliven the place a little, poor mites,&rdquo; said  Harrop, who considered Penlyon the abode of dullness; and Sarah the housemaid agreed  with her.</p>
<p>Harrop was to sleep in the larger room, and in the bed  which Miss Peterson had occupied during five peaceful years. Sarah had put up her  truckle bed in the inner and smaller room, where she was to keep guard over the  little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be downright cruelty to let any child sleep  alone in one of these ghastly rooms,&rdquo; said Sarah, the &ldquo;ghastliness&rdquo; being doubtless  a question of spaciousness and oak panelling, and ponderous old-fashioned furniture  which cast monstrous shadows in the pale glimmer of the night-light.</p>
<p>Hark! Yes, that was the roll of wheels on the gravel  drive, a nearer sound than the sullen swell of the sea out yonder grinding the pebbles  in an unresting mill.</p>
<p>Adela Hawberk flew down to the hall, followed by Harrop,  while Sarah the housemaid stopped upstairs and gave a final stir to the fires after  the wont of her tribe, who are always ready to use the poker, wanted or not wanted,  with a noble disregard to the coal-merchant&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>Sir John had heard the carriage stop, and the opening  of the hall door; and although he pretended to go on reading his paper by the lamp  placed close at his elbow, the pretence was a poor one, and anybody might have seen  that he was listening with all his might.</p>
<p>The footman had opened the hall door as the wheels drew  near, and it was wide open when the carriage stopped. The red light from the hall  fire streamed out upon the evening grey, and three little silvery voices were heard  exclaiming &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a pretty house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a big house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the smallest voice of the three, with amazing  distinctness &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What an exceedingly red fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage door flew open, and two little girls, all  in red from top to toe, and one little boy in grey, rolled out in a heap, or seemed  to roll out, like puppies out of a basket, and scrambled on to their feet, and ran  up the steps, Mr. Danby, slim and jaunty as usual, following them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, how tiny they are!&rdquo; cried Adela, stooping  down to kiss the smaller girl, a round red bundle, with a round little face, and  large dark grey eyes shining in the firelight.</p>
<p>The tiny thing accepted the kiss somewhat shrinkingly  and looked about her, awed by the grandeur of the hall, the large fireplace and  blazing logs, the men in armour, or the suits of armour standing up and pretending  to be men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like them,&rdquo; said the tiny girl, clinging to  Danby, and pointing with a muffled red hand at one of these mailed warriors. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  not alive, are they, Uncle Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, Moppet; they&rsquo;re as dead as door-nails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they? I don&rsquo;t like dead people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Moppet, suppose they&rsquo;re not people at all  &mdash; no more than a rocking-horse is a real live horse. We&rsquo;ll pull one of them down  to-morrow and look inside him; and then you&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page094.jpg" width="319" height="750" alt="page094"></h3>
<p>The larger scarlet mite, larger by about an inch, older  by a year, was standing before the fire, gravely warming her hands, spreading them  out before the blaze as much as hands so tiny could spread themselves. The boy was  skipping about the hall, looking at everything, the armed warriors especially, and  not at all afraid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re soldiers, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Laddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to be dressed like that, and go into  a battle and kill lots of people. I couldn&rsquo;t be killed myself, could I, if I had  that stuff all over me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, Laddie; but I don&rsquo;t think it would answer.  You&rsquo;d be an anachronism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t mind being a nackerism if it saved me from  being killed,&rdquo; said Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, little ones, come and be presented to your host,&rdquo;  said Mr. Danby, as the footman opened the library door; and they all poured in,  Danby, Adela, and the children, the smallest running in first, her sister and the  boy following, considerably in advance of the grown-ups.</p>
<p>Moppet ran right into the middle of the room, as fast  as her little red legs could carry her, then seeing Sir John sitting where the bright  lamplight shone full upon his pale elderly face, with its strongly marked features,  black eyebrows, and silvery grey hair, she stopped suddenly as if she had beheld  a Gorgon, and began to back slowly till she brought herself up against the silken  skirt of Adela Hawberk&rsquo;s gown, and in that soft drapery she in a manner absorbed  herself, till there was nothing to be seen of the little neatly rounded figure except  the tip of a bright red cap, and the toes of two bright red gaiters.</p>
<p>The elder mite had advanced less boldly, and had not  to beat so ignominious a retreat. She was near enough to Mr. Danby to clutch his  hand, and holding that, she was hardly at all frightened.</p>
<p>The boy, older, bolder, and less sensitive than either  of the girls, went skipping round the library as he had skipped about the hall,  looking at things and apparently unconscious of Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Danby?&rdquo; said Sir John, holding out his  hand as his old friend advanced to the fire, the little red girl hanging on to his  left hand, while he gave his right to his host. &ldquo;Upon my word, I began to think  you were never coming back. You&rsquo;ve been an unconscionable time. One would suppose  you had to fetch the children from the world&rsquo;s end,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to bring them to the world&rsquo;s end, you might say.  Boscastle is something more than a day&rsquo;s journey from London in the depth of winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are these the children? Good heavens, Danby! What  could you be thinking about to bring us such morsels of humanity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wanted children,&rdquo; said Danby, &ldquo;not hobbledehoys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hobbledehoys! No, but there is reason in everything.  You couldn&rsquo;t suppose I wanted infants like these &mdash; look at that little scrap hidden  in Adela&rsquo;s frock. It&rsquo;s positively dreadful to contemplate! They will be getting  under my feet. I shall be treading upon them, and hurting them seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>No you won&rsquo;t, Jack, I&rsquo;ll answer  for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of their individuality. They are small, but  they are people. When Moppet comes into a room everybody knows she is there. She  is a little scared now; but she will be as bold as brass in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon put on his spectacles and looked at  the little hirelings more critically. Their youth and diminutive size had been a  shock to him. He had expected bouncing children, with rosy faces, long auburn hair,  and a good deal of well-developed leg showing below a short frock. These, measured  against his expectations, were positively microscopic.</p>
<p>Their cheeks were pale rather than rosy. Their hair  was neither auburn nor long. It was dark hair, and it was cropped close to the neat  little heads, showing every bump in the broad, clever-looking foreheads. Sir John&rsquo;s  disapproving eyes showed him that the children were more intelligent than the common  run of children; but for the moment he was not disposed to accept intelligence instead  of size.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are preposterously small,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;not at all  the kind of thing I expected. They will get lost under chairs or buried alive in  waste-paper baskets. I wash my hands of them. Take them away, Adela. Let them be  fed and put to bed;&rdquo; then turning to Mr. Danby as if to dismiss the subject, &ldquo;Anything  stirring in London  when you were there, Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before Danby could answer, Moppet emerged from her shelter,  advanced deliberately, and planted herself in front of Sir John Penlyon, looking  him straight in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you don&rsquo;t like us. Mr. Old Gentleman,&rdquo; she  said.</p>
<p>Every syllable came with clear precision from those  infantine lips. Moppet&rsquo;s strong point was her power of speech. Firm, decisive, correct  as to intonation, came every sentence from the lips of this small personage. Ponderous  polysyllables were no trouble to Moppet. There was only an occasional consonant  that baffled her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says I don&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo; said Sir John, taken aback,  and lifting the animated bundle of red cloth on to his knee.</p>
<p>He found there was something very substantial inside  the woolly cloak and gaiters, a pair of round plump arms and sturdy little legs,  a compact little figure, which perched firmly on his knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said so,&rdquo; retorted Moppet, with her large grey  eyes very wide open, and looking-full into his. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like us because we are  so very small. Everybody says we are small, but everybody doesn&rsquo;t mind. Why do you  mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anything about not liking you, little  one. I was only afraid you were too small to go out visiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went out to tea when I was two, and nobody said I  was too small. I have real tea at parties, not milk-and-water. And I have been out  to tea often and often &mdash; haven&rsquo;t I, Lassie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so many times as I have,&rdquo; replied the elder red  thing, with dignity.</p>
<p>She was standing in front of the wide old fireplace,  warming her hands, and she was to Sir John&rsquo;s eye somewhat suggestive of a robin  redbreast that had fluttered in and lighted there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, because you&rsquo;re older,&rdquo; said Moppet,  disgusted at this superfluous self-assertion on her sister&rsquo;s part, &ldquo;I am always  good at parties &mdash; ain&rsquo;t I, Uncle Tom?&rdquo; turning an appealing face to Mr. Danby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So these Lilliputians are your nieces, Danby?&rdquo; exclaimed  Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, they are not exactly nieces, though they  are very near and dear. I am only a jury uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jury uncle!&rdquo; cried Moppet, throwing her head back  and laughing at the unknown word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A jury uncle!&rdquo; echoed the other two, and the three  laughed prodigiously, not because they attached any meaning to the word, but only  because they didn&rsquo;t know what it meant. That was where the joke lay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that in Cornwall  and in Sicily  all the elderly men are uncles, and all the old women aunts; everybody&rsquo;s uncles  and aunts,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Danby.</p>
<p>Moppet still occupied Sir John&rsquo;s knee. She felt somehow  that it was a post of honour, and she had no inclination to surrender it. Her tiny  fingers had possessed themselves of his watch-chain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please show me your watch,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Sir John drew out a big hunter.</p>
<p>Moppet approached her little rosy mouth to the hinge  and blew violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t it open like Uncle Tom&rsquo;s watch does when  I blow?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Is it broken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow again, and we&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; said Sir John,  understanding the manoeuvre.</p>
<p>The big bright case flew open as Moppet blew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care it doesn&rsquo;t bite your nose off.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>How big and bright it is &mdash; much  bigger and brighter than Uncle Tom&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s is a lady&rsquo;s watch, and Uncle Tom is a lady&rsquo;s  man,&rdquo; said Sir John, and the triple peal of childish laughter which greeted this  remark made him fancy himself a wit.</p>
<p>Small as they were these children were easily amused,  and that was a point in their favour, he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea is ready in the breakfast-room,&rdquo; said Adela.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tea in the breakfast-room! Oh, how funny!&rdquo; And again  they all laughed.</p>
<p>At any rate they were not doleful children &mdash; no long  faces, no homesick airs, no bilious headaches &mdash; so far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say they will all start measles or whooping-cough  before we have done with them,&rdquo; thought Sir John, determined not to be hopeful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we are to come to tea, are we?&rdquo; he said cheerily,  and he actually carried Moppet all the way to the breakfast-room, almost at the  other end of the rambling old house, and planted her in a chair by his side at the  tea-table. She nestled up close beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like us now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll like her,&rdquo; pointing to her sister with a  small distinct finger; &ldquo;&lsquo;and him,&rdquo; pointing to her brother, &ldquo;to-morrow morning.  You&rsquo;ll know us all tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow will be Christmas,&rdquo; said Laddie, as if giving  a piece of useful information to the company in general.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas!&rdquo; cried Danby; &ldquo;so it will. I mustn&rsquo;t forget  to hang up my stocking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This provoked a burst of mirth. Uncle Tom&rsquo;s stocking!  Uncle Tom hoping to get anything from Santa Claus!</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t laugh,&rdquo; said Mr. Danby, seriously. &ldquo;I mean  to hang up one of my big Inverness stockings. It  will hold a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you expect to get?&rdquo; asked Laddie, intensely  amused. &ldquo;Toys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; chocolates, butterscotch, hardbake, alecompane.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what&rsquo;s alecompane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name of this old-fashioned sweetmeat was received  with derision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what an old sweet-tooth you must be!&rdquo; exclaimed  Moppet; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe you a bit. I shall come in the middle of the night  to see if your stocking is there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find my room. You&rsquo;ll go into the wrong room  most likely, and find one of the three bears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet laughed at the notion of those familiar beasts.  &ldquo;There never were three bears that lived in a house, and had beds and chairs and  knives and forks and things,&rdquo; she said. <i>&ldquo;</i>I  used to believe it once when I was very little&rdquo; &mdash; she said <i>very</i> little; &ldquo;but now I know it isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked round the table with a solemn air, with  her lips pursed up, challenging contradiction. Her quaint little face, in which  the forehead somewhat overbalanced the tiny features below it, was all aglow with  mind. One could not imagine more mind in any living creature than was compressed  within this quaint scrap of humanity.</p>
<p>Sir John watched her curiously. He had no experience  of children of that early age. His own daughters had been some years older before  he began to notice them. He could but wonder at this quick and eager brain animating  so infinitesimal a body.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page105.jpg" width="483" height="750" alt="page105"></h3>
<p>Moppet looked round the table; and what a table it was!  She had never seen anything like it. Cornwall, like  Scotland, has a prodigious reputation  for breakfasts; but Cornwall, on occasion, can almost  rival Yorkshire in the matter of tea. Laddie and  Lassie had set to work already, one on each side of Miss Hawberk, who was engaged  with urn and teapot, Moppet was less intent upon food, and had more time to wonder  and scrutinize. Her big mind was hungrier than her little body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a lot of candles!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You must be  very rich, Mr. Old Gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight tall candles in two heavy old silver candelabra  lighted the large round table, and on the dazzling white cloth was spread such a  feast as little children love &mdash; cakes of many kinds, jams, and marmalade, buns,  muffins, and crisp biscuits fresh from the oven, scones both white and brown, and  the pale yellow clotted cream in the preparation of which Cornwall pretends to surpass  her sister Devon, as in her cider and pery and smoked pig. It is only natural that  Cornwall in her stately seclusion at the end of Western  England should look down upon Devonshire as sophisticated  and almost cockney. Cornwall is to Devon as the real (Scottish Highlands are to the Trossachs.  Besides the cakes and jams and cream-bowl, there were flowers, Christmas roses,  and real roses, yellow and red, such flowers as only grow in rich men&rsquo;s greenhouses,  and there was a big silver urn in which Laddie and Lassie could see their faces,  red and broad and shining, as they squeezed themselves each against one of Adela&rsquo;s  elbows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Uncle Tom,&rdquo; exclaimed Lassie, in a rapturous tone,  &ldquo;we shall never die here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for want of food certainly, Lassie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children had eaten nothing since a very early dinner  in Plymouth, and  on being pressed to eat by Miss Hawberk and Mr. Danby, showed themselves frankly  greedy. Sir John did nothing but look on and wonder at them. They showed him a new  phase of humanity. Did life begin so soon? Was the mind so fully awakened while  the body was still so tiny?</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, Mistress Moppet?&rdquo; he asked, when Moppet  had finished her first slice of saffron cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four and a quarter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not five years old. She had lived in the world less  than five years. She talked of what she had thought and believed when she was little;  and she seemed to know as much about life as he did, at sixty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a wonderful little woman, not to be afraid  of going out visiting without your nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse?&rdquo; echoed Moppet, staring at him with her big  grey eyes; &ldquo;what&rsquo;s a nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; explained Laddie. &ldquo;We never had  a nurse. It&rsquo;s a woman like Julie has to take care of her, Moppet,&rdquo; he explained  condescendingly&mdash;&rdquo; a <i>bonne </i>we call her.  But we&rsquo;ve never had a <i>bonne</i>,&rdquo; he added  with a superior air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; exclaimed Sir John; &ldquo;then pray who has taken  care of you, put you to bed at night, and washed and dressed you of a morning, taken  you out for walks, or wheeled you in a perambulator?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; cried the boy. &ldquo;Mother does all that &mdash; except  for me. I dress myself. I take my own bath. Mother says I&rsquo;m growing quite inde-in-de&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pendent,&rdquo; screamed Moppet across the table. &ldquo;What a  silly boy you are! You always forget the names of things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet was getting excited. The small cheeks were flushed  and the big eyes were getting bigger, and Moppet was inclined to gesticulate a good  deal when she talked, and to pat the tablecloth with two little hands to give point  to her speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moppet,&rdquo; said Mr. Danby, &ldquo;the hot cakes are getting  into your head. I propose an adjournment to Bedfordshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! <i>no!</i> no!  Uncle Tom. We ain&rsquo;t to go yet, is we?&rdquo; pleaded the child, snuggling close up to  Sir John&rsquo;s waistcoat, with the settled conviction that he was the higher authority.  The lapse in grammar was the momentary result of excitement. In a general way Moppet&rsquo;s  tenses and persons were as correct as if she had been twenty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you ought to be tired after your long journey,&rdquo;  said the baronet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t a long journey. We had dinner first,  and in the morning we walked on the Hoe. Isn&rsquo;t that a funny name for a place? And  we saw the sea, and Uncle Tom told us of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spanish Arcadia,&rdquo; interrupted Laddie, who felt it was  his turn now, &ldquo;and how Drake and the other captains were playing bowls on the Hoe,  just where&rsquo; we were standing that very minute, when the news of the Spanish ships  came and they went off to meet them; and there was a storm, and there was no fighting  wanted, for the storm smashed all the ships, and they went back to King Philip without  any masts, and Queen Elizabeth went on horseback to Tilbury, and that was the end  of the Arcadia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a historical synopsis I don&rsquo;t call that bad,&rdquo; said  Mr. Danby; &ldquo;nevertheless I recommend Bedfordshire if our little friends have finished  their tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; said Lassie, with a contented yawn.</p>
<p>Moppet did not want to go to bed. She had eaten less  than the other two, but she had talked more, and had slapped the table, and had  made faces, while Lassie and Laddie had been models of good manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t call it Bedfordshire,&rdquo; she said,  shaking her head vindictively at Mr. Danby. &ldquo;It makes it worse to go to bed when  people make jokes about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby came round to where she sat, and took her  up in his arms as if she had been a big doll instead of a small child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say good night to Sir John,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Moppet stooped her face down to the baronet&rsquo;s, and pursed  up her red lips in the prettiest little kiss, which was returned quite heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her away, Danby, she is much too excited, and  she is the funniest little thing I ever saw. Good night, my dears,&rdquo; he said to the  others, as he rose and walked towards the door. &ldquo;I hope you will spend a happy Christmas  at Place. Adela, be sure the little things are comfortable, and that Nurse Danby&rsquo;s  instructions are obeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children laughed at this rude mention of Mr. Danby,  and went off to bed repeating the phrase &ldquo;Nurse Danby&rdquo; with much chuckling and giggling.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Jack,&rdquo; said Danby, when Miss Hawberk had left  the diningroom, and he and Sir John were alone, with their chairs drawn up to the  hearth, their cigarettes lighted, and a bottle of Ch&acirc;teau Lafitte on the table between  them. &ldquo;Have you forgiven the children for being so much smaller than you expected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could forgive that youngest mite anything &mdash; smashing  the Portland vase,  if I owned it. She is what your friends over yonder&rdquo; (with a nod westward) &ldquo;would  call an amusing little cuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a little lump of love,&rdquo; answered Danby. &ldquo;One  has to know that child well to know how much there is in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very weak about her evidently &mdash; very fond of  all three, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am fond of them all. Lassie is going to grow  up a beauty. I shall be very proud of her twelve years hence, if I live so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say they are not actually your nephew and nieces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not actually!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they are pretty nearly related to you, I take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are as near to my heart as they can be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not very explicit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, Jack; that isn&rsquo;t in the bond. It was agreed  that the children were to come and go, and you were to know nothing about them,  except that they were decently brought up, and not likely to make themselves obnoxious.  They were to have no claim upon you. This visit was not to be the thin end of the  wedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>You needn&rsquo;t echo me, Danby.  I dare say I was rather cantankerous the other day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jack, you were open-handed and liberal, as  you always are; but naturally you didn&rsquo;t want, by a casual kindness, to establish  a claim, or to give anybody&rsquo;s poor relations the right to bother you. We&rsquo;ll stick  to the original notion, my dear friend. These children are hired to amuse you, and  to give just the touch of homely mirthfulness that suits the season. They will enjoy  all the good things your hospitality provides, and their frank happiness will enliven  this solitary old house, and on the morning after Twelfth Night they will wish you  good-bye, and will be seen no more at Penlyon    Place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Manage it your own way,&rdquo; said Sir John, with a faint  sigh.</p>
<p>He was thinking of his daughter Lilian, his elder daughter,  who had never disobeyed him &mdash; whose marriage had gratified his pride as a father.  If she had lived to be a mother how happy he would have been to see the third generation  growing up about him, to have welcomed sturdy grandsons and blooming granddaughters  to the house of his forefathers, to have seen the line of the Penlyons carried on  towards the dim future, with the promise of new honours and increasing wealth.</p>
<p>The bell rang at half-past eight for morning prayers,  a big bell in a cupola over the hall door. Sir John was in his armchair near the  hearth, with the large crimson-bound prayer-book open on the table in front of him,  waiting for the assembling of the household. The bell was still ringing when a scampering  of little feet was heard in the hall, the door was opened rather violently, and  Laddie and the two little girls came rushing in, their eyes sparkling, their cheeks  fresh and cold from the morning air.</p>
<p>Moppet ran straight to Sir John, and lifted up her rosebud  mouth for a kiss, and was immediately taken upon his knee. It seemed the only possible  thing to do with such a small creature, so round, so caressing, so bright and fresh  with sweet morning breezes and morning sunshine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very nice garden yours is,&rdquo; said Moppet, approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen the garden already. What an early bird  you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I didn&rsquo;t catch any worms. I don&rsquo;t like worms.  They&rsquo;re very ugly,&rdquo; said Moppet, shaking her head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid of them <i>now</i>, not even when they&rsquo;re ever so big; but  I &mdash; do &mdash; not &mdash; like &mdash; them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slapped her open palm upon Sir John&rsquo;s coat-sleeve  to give emphasis to this final statement: such a tiny, tiny hand, but with so much  character in all its movements. Laddie and Lassie meanwhile were walking slowly  round the breakfast-table, looking at the good things upon it. The big Cornish ham  and savoury pie, and cold pheasants were on the sideboard; but the large round table  was amply furnished with covered silver dishes, in which the children admired themselves,  and crystal jars of jam, and bowls of clotted cream, just the same as at last night&rsquo;s  tea.</p>
<p>Laddie came to a full stop, gazing with wide open eyes,  and gave a long sigh of content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor mother!&rdquo; he said, almost in tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with mother?&rdquo; asked Moppet from her  perch on Sir John&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She never has breakfast like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has what she likes. Mother isn&rsquo;t greedy like you.  Cake doesn&rsquo;t make her happy, nor even jam,&rdquo; said Moppet, with a philosophical air.  &ldquo;She has an egg every morning. My fowl lays it for her, sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you keep fowls, Moppet?&rdquo; asked Sir John, curiously  interested in every detail of these small lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep a fowl &mdash; a hen; cocks are ever so much prettier,  but they are fierce, and they won&rsquo;t lay eggs. I have got a hen, and she has got  one, and he has got one,&rdquo; said Moppet, pointing to the brother and sister, &ldquo;and  they all lay eggs for mother&rsquo;s breakfast, except when they won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, my pet, I am going to read prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; said Moppet, looking at him with wondering  eyes. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you say your prayers dreckly you&rsquo;re dressed, like we do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are family prayers, for everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Moppet, resignedly, with a very long face,  &ldquo;like church, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adela Hawberk and Mr. Danby came in one by one during  this conversation, and Adela now took Moppet, as it were, into custody, while Danby  looked after the other two. The three children were seated solemnly, with their  little hands quietly folded, but their eyes roaming about the room, when the servants  came filing in, and took their places near the door &mdash; the butler, portly and pompous;  the valet, tall and slim, languidly elegant; the cook colossal; the maids fresh-coloured  and prim, in cotton frocks and smart white caps; and Miss Hawberk&rsquo;s woman, bringing  up the rear, in a neat black gown and a something of lace and ribbon, which was  as little like a cap as she could make it.</p>
<p>Moppet, with her mouth wide open, counted these good  people in a loud whisper, and then, just as Sir John opened his book, and began  the preliminary scriptures, turned to Miss Hawberk in irrepressible surprise, and  exclaimed aloud &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Twelve servants! Mother has only one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked very sorry the next instant, when she heard  her little clear voice clash against Sir John&rsquo;s deep tones, and till the very end  of the family prayers she knelt or sat as mute as a statue.</p>
<p>The prayers were not too long for any one&rsquo;s patience.  The servants filed out of the room as quietly as they had entered, Miss Hawberk&rsquo;s  Abigail departing with an indolent grace, and with the door held open for her by  an admiring footman. Then came a delicious odour of coffee; and then the business  of breakfast began in earnest, and the children, who had been up at the first glimpse  of day, eager to find the toys in their stockings, mother&rsquo;s little gifts among  them, and who had been dressed and running about since half-past seven, were quite  ready for the meal. Mr. Danby looked after them, and took care that they had only  the things that were good for them, and those composed a somewhat Spartan bill of  fare.</p>
<p>The butler, who was on duty at the sideboard, carving,  approached Laddie as solemnly as if he were a grown-up person, and offered him a  plate of pheasant and ham. Laddie looked appealingly at Uncle Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to be thought of, Laddie! You are going to have  a dinner fit for a Lord Mayor of London,  and you must save yourself for that. Bread and butter and an egg for breakfast,  and nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet, who was breakfasting on a basin of bread and  milk, shook her head at her brother across the wide, round table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, Laddie, we never have meat for breakfast,&rdquo;  she said, &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t always have it for dinner. Sometimes we have rice pudding,  and sometimes we have batter pudding,&rdquo; she explained to the company in general:  &ldquo;and then we don&rsquo;t want meat, you know. It&rsquo;s better for us, and it&rsquo;s cheaper for  mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was as much at home in the dining-room at Penlyon Place as if  she had been in her own nursery. She had dragged a chair close to Sir John&rsquo;s elbow,  and had placed herself at his side unbidden. Moppet had a preference for the ruder  sex, perhaps resulting from her experience of her good friend Danby, who indulged  her more than anybody else in her small world. She admired Adela, and she liked  Adela&rsquo;s frock, and the way her hair was done; but she wanted to sit next the nice  old gentleman with the black eyebrows and silver-grey hair, who had taken her on  his knee and talked to her in his big, deep voice.</p>
<p>The church was close to the gates of Penlyon Place, and they  all walked there together on this fine Christmas morning. It was what people call  a green Christmas, the air soft and warm, the sky blue, and the sun shining on the  leafless branches of oak and beech and on the green underwood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ought to be snow at Christmas,&rdquo; said Lassie.  &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t like Christmas without snowballing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children behaved so discreetly in church that it  was clear that they were good little church people, and that the service was familiar  to them, though only Laddie made any pretence at reading his Prayer-book, and he  always read in the wrong place. Never a word spoke Moppet all through the long rustic  service, though her eyes and her sensitive lips were eloquent of many emotions &mdash;  wonder at the monuments on the wall in front of her, the knightly gentleman kneeling  face to face with his stately lady, and a diminishing line of six kneeling boys  behind him, and a diminishing line of six kneeling girls behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had they really six apiece?&rdquo; Moppet asked Sir John,  as she trotted homeward by his side, her tiny hand held firmly in his strong fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six what &mdash; who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the gentleman with the frill round his neck six  little boys? and had the lady with the frill round her neck six little girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Moppet, it&rsquo;s quite true, only they shared them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why are the boys all on one side?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s a more orderly arrangement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they all dead &mdash; down to the very littlest boy  when that thing was made?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not, for it would give me a poor opinion of  Cornwall as a health  resort two hundred and fifty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Was it as long ago as that when  there were those little boys?&rdquo; asked Moppet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longer. Nearly three hundred years!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three hundred! What a pity! I should like to have six  little boys like those to play with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you do with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things. We could play at battles &mdash; one can&rsquo;t  make a battle with three. It isn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t a fair fight either, Moppet, two to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Laddie thumps very hard. We have to push him  down and sit upon him; and when he can&rsquo;t get up we&rsquo;ve won!&rdquo; explained Moppet, with  a triumphant air.</p>
<p>Lassie had been walking ahead with Adela, but she came  running back and placed herself on Sir John&rsquo;s other side, pushing a very small hand,  but not so tiny as Moppet&rsquo;s, into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you like me a little bit, too,&rdquo; she said with  dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do, Lassie. I think you are a very nice  little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t like me as well as you do her,&rdquo; pointing  to Moppet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I know her best. She is such a forward young  lady, and she and I are quite old friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really older than me and you,&rdquo; said Lassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it naughty to be forward?&rdquo; Moppet asked gravely,  having considered the phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at four years old. You won&rsquo;t be able to jump upon  an elderly gentleman&rsquo;s knee and put your arms round his neck when you&rsquo;re four and  twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be too big; and I shouldn&rsquo;t want to unless  I liked him as much as I like you. Little girls sit on their father&rsquo;s knees, don&rsquo;t  they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean good little girls. And that isn&rsquo;t being forward,  is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Moppet, no. Fathers are made to be sat upon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would be my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Moppet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I never had one. Never, never. It&rsquo;s curious,  isn&rsquo;t it? Other little girls say it&rsquo;s curious when I tell them about it. Mother&rsquo;s  a&rdquo; &mdash; stopping with a puzzled look&mdash; &ldquo;the kind of person who has a dead husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A widow,&rdquo; suggested Sir John, startled at the turn  of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a widow. And I was born after he was dead. It&rsquo;s  so long ago that I don&rsquo;t remember, and mother was very sorry then, awfully sorry,  and she was so ill and so sorry that she didn&rsquo;t care about me. She didn&rsquo;t even know  I was there. It was months and months before she knew anything about me; but, when  she began to know, she liked me very much, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m her favourite child,&rdquo;  explained Moppet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t talk about favourites. A mother loves all  her children alike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t true,&rdquo; said Moppet. &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not a mother,  and you don&rsquo;t know, so you didn&rsquo;t mean to tell a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John accepted this rebuke meekly, and as they had  now arrived at the hall door he informed his young friend that he had some letters  to write, and must part company with her for an hour or two.</p>
<p>The little woman in red looked up at him with a sorrowful  face. She was an adhesive young person, and she had taken a fancy to her host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t I come with you?&rdquo; she asked plaintively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be very quiet. I sit with mother when she writes her letters, and sometimes she  lets me wipe the pen. She has such a dear little penholder, like a tortoise-shell  cat, only it&rsquo;s not alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John was polite but firm. He was charmed with Moppet,  but he preferred to write his letters without her company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet at dinner,&rdquo; he said, stooping very low  to kiss the atom of a hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall sit next you?&rdquo; asked Moppet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my right hand, as the guest of the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>
<p>The Christmas custom at Penlyon Place was one which in Sir John&rsquo;s  mind reduced Christmas Day to a penitential anniversary. On Christmas Day the family  dinner was at five o&rsquo;clock instead of at eight, in order that the servants might  enjoy their evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their evening!&rdquo; echoed Sir John, ruefully, when the  matter was put before him as a sacrifice which the head of a respectable British  household was called upon to make. &ldquo;Their evening, forsooth! As if they had not  three hundred and sixty-five evenings in the year in which to take their ease and  be merry from nine to eleven, but must needs throw <i>our</i> lives out of gear, and make <i>our </i>evening wretched with the memory of a ridiculously early dinner, while they  are uproarious over snapdragon or forfeits in the servants&rsquo; hall. The whole thing  is an absurdity.&rdquo; Absurd as it was, Sir John had been coaxed into submission; and  now on this particular Christmas Day he was quite resigned to the five-o&rsquo;clock dinner,  and was amused at the delight of the little hirelings, who clapped their hands and  jumped and chirped like three grasshoppers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all going to have late dinner!&rdquo; they cried, in  a chorus of small silvery voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You poor things!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Hawberk. &ldquo;Do you never  have late dinner at home, not even on Christmas Day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; answered the boy. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any late dinner.  Mother dines with us very early, and then in the evening, when the candles are lit,  we all have tea, mother and all of us, and jam sandwiches, and then I sit by the  fire and learn my spelling while mother puts Lassie and Moppet to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stops up last because he&rsquo;s the oldest,&rdquo; explained  Moppet, who always addressed her small speeches to Sir John, &ldquo;and we don&rsquo;t learn  no spelling because we&rsquo;re too young. But I know most of Laddie&rsquo;s words,&rdquo; she added  with sly triumph. &ldquo;Laddie is very slow, and I&rsquo;m rather quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too quick, Moppet,&rdquo; said Mr. Danby, lifting the tiny  creature in his arms, and looking at her with a touch of melancholy. &ldquo;If my watch  were to go as fast as that small brain of yours I should be afraid the works would  wear out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children went for a walk on the cliffs with Miss  Hawberk and the gentleman whom they called Uncle Tom, and while they were strolling  in the grey softness of a green Christmas, watching silvery sea-gulls wheeling and  chattering in the soft grey sky, or congregating on a ledge of rocks, and the black  shags diving for fish, Sir John came across the hillocky turf and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you written all your letters?&rdquo; asked Moppet, severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as I cared to write, little one. The mild afternoon  tempted me to a stroll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet waited for no permission, but at once possessed  herself of Sir John&rsquo;s forefinger, and held on to his thick doeskin glove with a  firm little grip. He could but wonder that such tiny fingers could hold him so tight.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>And what does Moppet think of  the sea?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like your sea better than our sea at home. There  are such big, big, big rocks, and such a lot of black birds, and such a lot of white  and grey birds. Uncle Tom showed us a rock just now that was all covered with birds.  You couldn&rsquo;t see the rocks for the birds. And then he threw a stone and they all  flew off screaming, screaming like human persons. It was so funny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it seems you live by the sea when you are at home,  Moppet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always&mdash;&rsquo;cept when it&rsquo;s the season, and then mother  lets her house to an English family, and we go to a farm where there are calves,  and pigs, and ducks and chickens, and where we all wear wooden shoes and run about  in the mud. It&rsquo;s lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, Moppet, you are only half an English girl. You  live on the other side of the Channel?&rdquo; said Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by the Channel. We live  in F&rsquo;ance, but we&rsquo;re not F&rsquo;ench.&rdquo; The letter represented difficulties not always  surmounted even in Moppet&rsquo;s exceptionally distinct speech. &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s English, and  father&rsquo;s English, and we&rsquo;re English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father w<i>as</i> English,&rdquo; corrected Sir John. You told me your father was dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but we never say w<i>as</i> about father. Mother likes us to think that he&rsquo;s always with us,  though we can&rsquo;t see him. His spirit is there, you know, and he is glad when we are  good, and he is very, very sorry when we are naughty &mdash; most of all when we are unkind  to each other. Laddie didn&rsquo;t think of that the day he gave me the bad slap,&rdquo; continued  Moppet, as if she were speaking of an event in history, like the Indian Mutiny,  &ldquo;or he wouldn&rsquo;t have done it; but he thought of it afterwards, and he was awfully  sorry for having grieved father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it you don&rsquo;t all talk French, Moppet, since  you live in France?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we always live with mother, and she talks English  with us. She doesn&rsquo;t want us to learn French from servants and common people; so  we only know the useful words &mdash; things you know &mdash; food and clothes and such things,  and how to ask our way, or to tell people where we live, if ever we should be lost.  And we pick up words sometimes. We can&rsquo;t help learning words on the sands when we  hear the little French children who are playing there, though mother won&rsquo;t let us  play with them. And mother is going to teach us French grammar by-and-by, when we  are old enough to learn properly. But I,&rdquo; concluded Moppet, putting on a consequential  air, &ldquo;am not to learn anything for ever so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a privileged little person! But why not, pray?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m much too clever, Mr. Minchin said. I&rsquo;m  greatly in advance of my age. If I were forced or worried about lessons I might  have water on the brain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could have surpassed Moppet&rsquo;s grand air as she  mentioned this possibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Minchin is your doctor, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s a hoppafist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; growled Sir John. &ldquo;Nobody but a fool  would have talked in that way before a dear little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t a fool really,&rdquo; replied Moppet, with her  most grown-up air. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t know I could hear him. I was playing in the garden,  and the parlour window was open, and I took my little chair under the window and  sat there quietly and listened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not right, Moppet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mother said when I told her. But why shouldn&rsquo;t I  listen? It was all about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but you weren&rsquo;t meant to hear it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate secrets &mdash; about <i>me.</i> I don&rsquo;t like doctors that whisper in corners about medicines, and  next morning mother comes with a dose of something horrid, because of what the doctor  said yesterday when I was playing with my doll. I call that mean of a doctor. But  Mr. Minchin isn&rsquo;t like the horrid doctors. He only gives us globules or tablaws.  Can <i>you</i> swallow tablaws without tasting  them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean tabloids. No, Moppet, I have never  tried them. The doctor hasn&rsquo;t attacked the gout-fiend with anything so mild. Homoeopathy  has never tempered the wind for this shorn lamb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dinner at Penlyon    Place on that particular Christmas Day was a grand  function. The cook had surpassed herself in the preparation of plum pudding, mince  pies, creams, jellies, and junket, stimulated to effort by the thought of the children.  What was the use of making tarts or jellies for Sir John&rsquo;s table, when the master  of the house rarely touched anything of that kind, hardly looked at the best trifle  or tipsy cake that could be offered to him; but there was some pleasure in cooking  nice things for children, even if the children were to make themselves ill by eating  too much or by mixing their puddings. Christmas came only once in the year; and  no restraining consideration of health or the doctor should be allowed to spoil  such a joyful season.</p>
<p>So the creams and jellies and junket were placed upon  the dinner-table, as if it had been a ball supper, in order that the children should  see them; and loud and joyous were the childish exclamations at the appearance of  the feast, at the clusters of tall candles in the old silver candelabra, the old-fashioned  epergne with its crystal dishes of bon-bons and sparkling fruits, crowned with a  large basket-shaped dish of great purple grapes; the flowers, the dazzling white  damask, and diamond cut glass. There was nothing new or modish from Venice or Bohemia, no Liberty silk or fantastic ornamentation.  Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s dinner-table was not in the movement. Indeed, it was arranged  very much as it had been for his grandfather when the century was young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw late dinner before,&rdquo; said Moppet; and then  with a sigh of contentment, she exclaimed, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were dressed for dinner, and there was  nothing shabbily genteel or tawdrily fine in their raiment. Laddie wore a neat little  black velvet suit, and the two little girls were in white cashmere frocks, which  made them look more like dolls than ever.</p>
<p>The crowning glory of the feast was the pudding. The  room was darkened in the old-fashioned way, and the great plum pudding was brought  in surrounded with flames, and all the company looked like ghosts in the blue unearthly  light, a ceremony repeated all over the land on that day in houses where there were  children &mdash; rather boring for the grown-ups, but such a rapturous experience for  the children, especially for the smallest child, who is just a little frightened  perhaps at the entrance of the demon pudding, and hysterical with delight when the  first shock is over.</p>
<p>This pudding was saluted with a tremendous clapping  of tiny hands, which sounded like the applause of an audience of fairies. The whole  business was rapture, most of all when it was discovered that there were some new  sixpences in the pudding. The excitement increased to fever-heat when Mr. Danby  found a sixpence in his portion, and exhibited an amount of pleasure which indicated  an avaricious disposition, and quite shocked Moppet.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page139.jpg" width="669" height="750" alt="page139"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you&rsquo;ll give me your sixpence,&rdquo; she said,  stretching out a tiny palm in his direction; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t want it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Danby. &ldquo; I do want it very  much. Sixpence is sixpence all the world over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a man of your age can&rsquo;t want sixpence,&rdquo; with grave  remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t he? Why, there are lots of things that sixpence  will buy for a man of my age. A cigar, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can&rsquo;t want <i>that</i> sixpence. You have always lots of money. I&rsquo;ve seen you take out  shillings &mdash; a handful of shillings &mdash; from your waistcoat pocket when you were paying  for our <i>brioches</i> at the pastrycook&rsquo;s,  or buying us toys in the Grande Rue. You can&rsquo;t want that sixpence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to spend, Moppet. I shall keep it for luck. I shall  bore a hole in it and wear it next my heart in memory of a Christmas dinner with  you &mdash; your first late dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad of that,&rdquo; said Moppet, greatly relieved. &ldquo;I  was afraid you were a miser after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laddie and Lassie greeted this speech with uproarious  laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A miser! Uncle Tom a miser! Why, you know he is always  bringing us things. Mother has to be quite cross sometimes to prevent him spending  too much money upon us,&rdquo; said Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Tom gave us our silk stockings,&rdquo; explained Lassie.  &ldquo;They&rsquo;re real silk; not spun silk, like most little girls have. They came in a letter  from Wears and Swells. Wasn&rsquo;t that a funny letter? Mother told Uncle Tom he was  dreadfully extravagant; but he only laughed. He is not the least little bit of a  miser; not nearly such a miser as Moppet, who puts all her half-francs into a money-box  that won&rsquo;t open, and then asks mother for sous to spend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more than one sixpence in the pudding. Each  of the children discovered a glittering new coin, and in Moppet&rsquo;s portion there  were two sixpences. The stout and serious butler helping the pudding on the carving-table  by the light of a single candle was suspected of treasonable practices.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page142.jpg" width="666" height="750" alt="page142"></h3>
<p>If the pudding with its halo of blue flame were a glorious  thing, how much more glorious was the Christmas-tree in the great Tudor hall, the  Christmas-tree with innumerable tapers that were reflected in the bright armour  of those dead and gone warriors whose prowess had helped to win victory at Agincourt  or whose strength had prolonged the bitter struggle at home in the Wars of the Roses.  Miss Hawberk had sent round some little notes of invitation, swift and sudden as  the fiery cross, and had assembled all the little ladies and gentlemen of the neighbourhood,  the pretty fair-haired girls from the Rectory, and the children of the only two  gentlefolk&rsquo;s families within an easy drive of Penlyon Place, and Mr. Nicholls, the  old bachelor doctor, had also been invited; perhaps in order to throw in a warning-word  occasionally when the revellers seemed inclined to over-eat themselves. All the  little girls had long hair, combed and brushed and crinkled to perfection; and they  looked rather suspiciously at Lassie and Moppet&rsquo;s round-cropped heads, as little  Africans with their hair caked in clay might look at the children of another tribe  who wore no clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you and her had a fever?&rdquo; one little girl inquired  of Moppet, pointing at Lassie as she asked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why was your hair cut so short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the F&rsquo;ench way,&rdquo; explained Moppet, gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>We</i> are not F&rsquo;ench, but we live in F&rsquo;ance and mother likes our hair cut in the F&rsquo;ench  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; sighed the long-haired child, relieved in mind. <i>&ldquo;</i>It&rsquo;s very ugly. Gracie had her hair like  that once, but then she&rsquo;d had a fever. Your mother must be a funny woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No she ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Moppet, firing instantly. &ldquo;She  ain&rsquo;t half so funny as your mother.&rdquo; Moppet pointed to a stout lady in black velvet  and a Roman sash &mdash; a stout lady with a rubicund face. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t like my mother  to be as fat as yours, or as red,&rdquo; said Moppet, and with this parting shot marched  off and left the long-haired beautifully brushed and crinkled little girl inanely  staring, shocked, but far too stupid to retort, hereditary fleshiness muffling her  intellectual faculties.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page145.jpg" width="515" height="750" alt="page145"></h3>
<p>Sir John Penlyon had just seated himself on the great  oaken settle in the chimney corner, after somewhat languidly performing his duty  as host. Moppet walked straight to him, clambered on his knee, and nestled her head  in his waistcoat, gazing up at him with very much the same dumb devotion he had  seen in the topaz eyes of a favourite Clumber spaniel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Moppet, are you tired of your new little friends?&rdquo;  he asked kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like children. They are so silly,&rdquo; answered  Moppet, with decision. &ldquo;I like you much better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really, now? I wonder how much you like me.  As well as you like junket?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a silly question! As if one could care for  any nice thing to eat as well as one cares for a live person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t one? I believe there are little boys in Boscastle  who are fonder of plum pudding than of all their relations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be horrid little boys. Laddie is greedy;  but he is not so greedy as that. I shouldn&rsquo;t like to live in the same house with  him if he were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For fear he should turn cannibal and eat <i>you?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is a camomile, and does it really eat people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind, Moppet; there are none in our part of the  world,&rdquo; said Sir John, hastily, feeling that he had made a <i>faux pas,</i> and might set Moppet dreaming of cannibals if he explained  their nature and attributes.</p>
<p>He had been warned by his friend Danby that Moppet was  given to dreaming at night of anything that had moved her wonder or her fear in  the day, and that she would awaken from such dreams in a cold perspiration, with  wild eyes and clenched hands. Her sleep had been haunted by goblins, and made hideous  by men who had sold their shadows, and by wolves who were hungry for little girls  in red cloaks. It had been found perilous to tell her the old familiar fairy tales  which most children have been told, and from which many children have suffered in  the dim early years, before the restrictions of space and climate are understood,  and wolves, bears, and lions located in their own peculiar latitudes.</p>
<p>Sir John looked down at the little dark head which was  pressed so lovingly against his waistcoat, and at the long dark lashes that veiled  the deep-set eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you really like me?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really <i>love</i> you. Not so much as I love mother, but very, very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much as Danby &mdash; as Uncle Tom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better than Uncle Tom; but please don&rsquo;t tell him so.  It might make him unhappy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it would. Uncle Tom has a jealous disposition.  He might shut you up in a brazen tower.&rdquo; Another <i>faux pas.</i> Moppet would be dreaming of brazen towers. Imagination, assisted  by plum pudding, would run readily into tormenting visions.</p>
<p>Happily Moppet made no remark upon the tower. She was  thinking &mdash; thinking deeply &mdash; and presently she looked up at Sir John with grave,  grey eyes, and said &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I love you better than Uncle Tom, because  you are a grander gentleman,&rdquo; she said musingly, <i>&ldquo;</i>and because you have this beautiful big house. It is yours, isn&rsquo;t it  &mdash; your very, very own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very, very own. And so you like my house, Moppet?  And will you be sorry to go away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, because I shall be going to mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you like your own home better than this big house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I should be very silly if I did. Home  is a funny little house, in a funny little sloping garden on the side of a hill.  Uncle Tom says it is very healthy. There is a tiny <i>salon,</i> and a tiny dining-room, and a dear little kitchen, where the <i>bonne &agrave; tout faire</i> lives, and four tiny  bedrooms. It was a fisherman&rsquo;s cottage once, and then an English lady &mdash; an old lady  &mdash; bought it, and made new rooms, and had it all made pretty, and then she died;  and then Uncle Tom happened to see it, and took it for mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was my little Moppet born there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I was born a long, long way off &mdash; up in the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The north-west provinces. It&rsquo;s an awful long way off  &mdash; but I can&rsquo;t tell you anything about it,&rdquo; added Moppet, with a solemn shake of  her cropped head, &ldquo;for I was born before I can remember. Laddie says we all came  over the sea &mdash; but we mustn&rsquo;t talk to mother about that time, and Laddie&rsquo;s very  stupid &mdash; he may have told me all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doesn&rsquo;t Lassie remember coming home in the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She remembers a gentleman who gave her goodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not the ship; but she thinks there must have been  a ship, for the wind blew very hard, and the gentleman went up and down as if he  was in a swing. Laddie pretends to remember all the sailors&rsquo; names, but I don&rsquo;t  think he really can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the only house you can remember is the house on  the hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where mother is now &mdash; yes, that&rsquo;s the only one, and  I&rsquo;m very fond of it. Are you fond of this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Moppet; one is always fond of the house in which  one was born. I was born here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet looked up at him wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that very surprising?&rdquo; he asked, smiling down at  her.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>It seems rather surprising you should  ever have been born,&rdquo; replied Moppet, frankly; &ldquo;you are so <i>very</i> old.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but one has to begin, you see, Moppet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been a twemendously long time ago when  you and Uncle Tom began.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The explosion of a cracker startled Moppet from the  meditative mood. It was the signal for the rifling of the tree. The crackers &mdash; the  gold and silver and sapphire and ruby and emerald crackers &mdash; were being distributed,  and were exploding in every direction before Moppet could run to the tree and hold  up two tiny hands, crying excitedly, <i>&ldquo;</i>Me,  me, me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been settled that the tree was not to be touched  till the visitors had finished their tea. The house-party, represented by Laddie  and Lassie, had been fuming and fretting at the slowness with which cakes and buns  were consumed; but now Uncle Tom, robed in a long maroon-velvet dressing-gown of  Sir John&rsquo;s, with a black velvet cap on his head, to represent a necromancer, had  given the signal, and was scattering crackers among the eager hands of dancing,  leaping children, all crying, &ldquo;Me, me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby had taken a good deal of trouble to disguise  himself. He had made himself a long beard of white horsehair &mdash; a beard which would  have done for old Father Time himself &mdash; and which reached from Mr. Danby&rsquo;s ears  to his waist. But the children hardly looked at him and expressed no astonishment  at his appearance. All they cared for was to get the crackers and the toys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, me! Another cracker, please. Please, please give  me one!&rdquo; That was the cry, varied by smaller voices saying, &ldquo;Dive me a doll,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dive me that pretty fing up dere!&rdquo; pointing to a glittering  gilt watch, or to a fairy in star-spangled skirt.</p>
<p>But the toys on the tree were little dainty things more  for ornament than use. The real toys were in a great washing basket which two men  brought into the hall, staggering under it.</p>
<p>There were toys enough for everybody; and Mr. Danby  distributed them with admirable judgment. He had even a packet for Miss Hawberk,  tied with blue ribbon, out of which rolled a pair of long gloves such as young ladies  love. Adela screamed at sight of the gloves, just as the children screamed at their  railway engines and stone bricks.</p>
<p>When every child had received the most appropriate toy  possible and general contentment prevailed, the basket was not even half empty.  Laddie peered into its depths curiously, hugging his clockwork steam-engine under  his arm &mdash; a green engine modelled upon those on the South-Western Railway, which  are said to be the finest in England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots more toys,&rdquo; he said to Mr. Danby, with  that shrewd insinuating look which marks childish greed. <i>&ldquo;</i>Are we going to have those?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Laddie. You have had your share. Those are for  other children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see, Laddie, all in good time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laddie thought the only good time would be a time which  would give him a share in those unopened parcels.</p>
<p>For Moppet the necromancer had a doll &mdash; a lovely fairhaired  doll, with staring blue eyes which occupied about a third of her face. Nature has  endowed the expensive doll with these enormous eyes. To Moppet&rsquo;s lively imagination  the doll, from the moment it was deposited in her arms, became a personage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling, you must have a name!&rdquo; she murmured tenderly.  &ldquo;I shall call you Mary, after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to Sir John with her treasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she lovely?&rdquo; she asked; and then, without waiting  to be answered, &ldquo;Her name is Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife&rsquo;s name! He started ever so slightly at the  sound; so familiar long ago, so strange to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is called after me. I am her godmother. I shall  have to teach her the catechism &mdash; the catechism that Laddie has to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you have an <i>alias.</i> I thought your name was Moppet,&rdquo; said Sir John, as she seated  her doll on his knee and stood leaning against him, touching and examining that  divine piece of waxwork, its lace petticoats, its blue silk shoes and open-work  socks &mdash; a very paragon of dolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew my real name wasn&rsquo;t Moppet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Nobody  was ever christened Moppet! It&rsquo;s only one of mother&rsquo;s nonsense names, like Laddie  and Lassie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, then you all have bettermost names for high days  and holidays. Pray, what is Laddie&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same as yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he is John, is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, John &mdash; but not Sir John. He is not a bawonight,&rdquo;  making a great deal of the strange word which the servants had taught her, as an  attribute of the grave elderly gentleman to whom she had taken so kindly. &ldquo;Will  he be a bawonight when he grows up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his own look-out. I take it he will have to  win his baronetcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Win it? At cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what does my little Moppet know about cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots. We play at spekilation with Uncle Tom, for nuts,  and <i>vingt-et-un</i>, and he says that&rsquo;s almost  as good as bac-bac-bac-ca-ra!&rdquo; She stumbled over the word, but finished it triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid Uncle Tom is a dangerous person to be with  children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is. Mother says so. He takes us down to the <i>plage</i> and gives us donkey rides, and I once  fell off&rdquo; &mdash; this with an air&mdash;&rdquo;and grazed my elbow. The blood came through the sleeve  of my over-all. Lassie has never fallen off a donkey. Laddie has. They generally  lie down with him. He kicks them too much. They will bear a good deal of kicking  because their skins are so thick, but Laddie overdoes it. He is not a nice boy &mdash;  not always,&rdquo; Moppet concluded musingly.</p>
<p>She liked standing quietly at Sir John&rsquo;s knee with her  doll, though the other children were playing Post in a noisy circle round Mr. Danby  and Adela on the other side of the hall. The many-coloured tapers on the Christmas-tree  were all extinguished but not burnt out, only half-burnt, and the tree was still  covered with golden balls, and tiny oranges, and glittering green and ruby fish,  and fairy dolls nodding and trembling in space.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to go and play with the children  over there, Moppet? They seem to be having a spirited game.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for games. I like to be here with you  and Mary. You don&rsquo;t mind me here, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear. I think I can put up with you till your  bedtime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That word bedtime is always it damper to juvenile spirits.  In all those early years of life the idea of bed is pretty much what the idea of  Portland or Dartmoor  is to the criminal classes. Children hear their elders talk of wanting to go to  bed, and wonder at such a perverted taste. There is always a sense of humiliation  in that premature banishment. The grown-ups sit smiling and talking &mdash; bid goodnight  condescendingly in a parenthesis &mdash; and one feels that their evening is only just  beginning. The elder sisters step into a carriage perhaps, and are whisked off to  the opera or play-house, while strong-armed Nurse conducts the little ones to their  nursery cots &mdash; to premature night and darkness that seem endless. It is a cruel  inequality of fortune.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>Isn&rsquo;t it a lovely tree?&rdquo; Moppet  inquired presently, her eyes wandering to that fairy-like conifer in the middle  of the hall, with horizontal branches rising tier above tier, laden with things  of beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a fine specimen of the <i>arbor toyensis</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing that makes me sorry about it,&rdquo;  said Moppet, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody hasn&rsquo;t got a tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are a little socialist. You would like all  children to have just as good a Christmas as you are having.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t they? They&rsquo;re just as good as me, ain&rsquo;t  they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose they are, Moppet; only you happen to be here  and they are somewhere else. But don&rsquo;t be down-hearted, my pet; there are a great  many Christmas-trees blooming with toys and golden flowers to-night, and thousands  of children dancing round them, just as happy as you and Lassie and Laddie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are there more children who have a Christmas-tree than  the children who haven&rsquo;t a Christmas-tree?&rdquo; asked Moppet, after a pause, with the  child&rsquo;s love of statistics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m afraid there are more of the treeless children  than of the fortunate ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that a pity? If it was only the naughty children  who had to go without toys it wouldn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; argued Moppet, severely;<i> &ldquo;</i>but I dare say there are naughty boys and  girls getting toys and crackers, while there are poor good children without so much  as a penny toy, only because their mothers haven&rsquo;t any money. Our mother isn&rsquo;t rich,  but we&rsquo;ve had a Christmas-tree ever since I can remember &mdash; quite two Christmases.  It was only a little tree; but such a pretty little tree. Uncle Tom sent us all  the toys and ornaments and little coloured candles in a big wooden box; and we all  helped mother to dress the tree. It was more fun than not knowing anything about  it, and standing outside the door in the dark, and then coming in and being surprised.  Our fun lasted ever so much longer, and we were surprised after all when we saw  the tree with the candles all lighted. It wasn&rsquo;t a bit like the same tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you wouldn&rsquo;t have known the dolls if you had met  them in the street?&rdquo; said Sir John, smiling at her grave earnestness.</p>
<p>Bedtime, the inexorable summons, put an end to the conversation.  The fair-haired Rectory girls and the other little people were bidding good night,  and the girls were being muffled in pink and blue hoods and cloaks, while the boys  struggled manfully with the sleeves of their warm overcoats.</p>
<p>A cold wind blew in from the vestibule when the outer  door was opened &mdash; a nipping, frosty wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a change in the weather,&rdquo; said Mr. Danby. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve  had snow at Brighton and at Portsmouth.  I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if our green Christmas were to change to a white one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how nice that would be!&rdquo; cried Laddie, clapping  his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to be snowed-up at Penlyon Place? Well,  we don&rsquo;t often get snow in Cornwall,  but perhaps we may be able to oblige you,&rdquo; said Sir John, gaily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Moppet looked out of window next morning she looked  at a white world &mdash; a world of fairy-like trees, whose interwoven branches made a  brilliant lace-work that sparkled in the sun. A north-east wind was blowing under  a blue, cloudless sky. It must have been snowing for a long time to cover the park  and gardens with that thick white carpet; but the morning was bright and sunny,  and Moppet thought the change delightful.</p>
<p>Pleasant news greeted her at breakfast. First a little  present from mother, a soft Shetland shawl, knitted by mother&rsquo;s own fingers, and  snowy-white like the outside world a shawl to wrap Moppet&rsquo;s head and shoulders when  she ran out into the garden. Lassie had one exactly like it, and Laddie had a big,  thick white scarf. They had come in a post-parcel to Mr. Danby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did mother know it was going to be cold?&rdquo; wondered  Lassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s thoughts always go before things,&rdquo; said Moppet,  gravely.</p>
<p>The next pleasantness was the news of a party, another  children&rsquo;s party, which had been planned by Mr. Danby and Miss Hawberk, and which  was submitted to Sir John for approval.</p>
<p>Would he object to their giving the cottage children  a tea-party in the schoolhouse that evening, with the reversion of the Christmas-tree  as the feature of the entertainment? They had plenty of toys left for distribution,  plenty of Tom Smith crackers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Tom Smith!&rdquo; sighed Moppet. &ldquo;What a nice man he  must be! You don&rsquo;t object, do you?&rdquo; she asked Sir John, squeezing her chair, with  a high cushion upon it to bring her up to table level, a little closer to his own.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d like the cottage children to have some fun? They all looked so nice at church  yesterday, in their pretty red cloaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John gave them those red cloaks,&rdquo; observed Miss  Hawberk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good of you! But you don&rsquo;t object, do you? They  are such tidy children. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll be careful of their toys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet had her doll on her lap, wedged in between her  pinafore and the table, and supposed to be consuming occasional spoonfuls of bread  and milk.</p>
<p>Sir John did not object, They could have a tea-party  for all the children in Cornwall  if they liked, if they could get the pixies to bring them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the pixies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet had to be told about the pixies before she would  peacefully finish her bread and milk. She rattled her spoon against the basin in  her excitement, and the dark grey eyes seemed to grow larger as she listened.</p>
<p>There were occasional snow showers in the day, just  enough to maintain the freshness of that vast white carpet which had been unrolled  over the park. The north-east wind blew with a biting sharpness which it rarely  knows on that western coast, and swept every cloudlet out of the bright blue sky.  The children wore their warmest wraps when they ran out on the terrace, which the  gardeners had swept from end to end, piling up a bank of snow on the outer side,  all the length of the broad walk, a store of material for the building of a snow  man which Mr. Danby assisted them to pile up at the further end of the walk, out  of sight of the windows, lest he should be an eyesore.</p>
<p>This rugged and shapeless monster was not completed  till the children&rsquo;s early dinner, though they toiled vigorously, digging out lumps  of snow from the bank, running backwards and forwards, flushed and eager, fetching  and carrying for that accomplished sculptor, Uncle Tom, who desisted not from his  labours till the monster towered like Milton&rsquo;s Lucifer, but with no more shape or  likeness of humanity than a pillar post-box. The likeness was achieved presently  by an old cloth cap of Uncle Tom&rsquo;s, a short pipe, two bits of coal for eyes, and  two bits of stick for nose and mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;ll do now,&rdquo; said the sculptor, complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather crooked,&rdquo; criticized Laddie, while the  little girls stood, flushed and panting, with no feeling but admiration for this  great work of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, Laddie,&rdquo; cried the sculptor. &ldquo;Crookedness  means destruction. A snow man must hold himself straight or he is doomed. You&rsquo;d  better bring me some more snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rushed off with their spades and wooden baskets  &mdash; spades and baskets that had been used on the beach by a former generation, and  which had been produced from an old toy closet by Sarah, the housemaid. They brought  more snow, and Uncle Tom thickened the base of the monster till he looked like a  Druidic monument, and then they left him to his fate.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page167.jpg" width="533" height="750" alt="page167"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll last now till the thaw,&rdquo; said Uncle Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will the thaw spoil him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, when the thaw comes he will silently vanish away,  like the Snark. There will be nothing left of him but a great puddle at that end  of the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle Tom sent the children off to get their shoes and  stockings changed before dinner. He was like a nurse in his care of them.</p>
<p>Sir John was out shooting, tramping through snowy plantations,  and the luncheon-dinner was a very noisy meal. Mr. Danby and Miss Hawberk let the  children do as they liked. It was Bank Holiday, and that meant liberty for great  and small, Mr. Danby said. There never was a merrier meal eaten at Place &mdash; certainly  not within Adela&rsquo;s recollection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas used to be so dreadfully dull in this house,&rdquo;  said the young lady. &ldquo;One felt one ought to be a little livelier because it was  Christmas, and that only made one feel duller, don&rsquo;t you know. It was all very well  for you, Mr. Danby, out shooting all day with Sir John and playing billiards in  the evening, but I could only read a novel, or brood over all the Cinderellas I  was missing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page171.jpg" width="850" height="697" alt="page171"></h3>
<p>Poor Adela had been sent to Penlyon Place, as into captivity, for more  Christmas seasons than she could count, her mother and father declaring that it  was her duty to go and amuse her uncle at that festive time, since he had always  been particularly fond of her.</p>
<p>This idea of fondness on Sir John&rsquo;s part had no definite  basis, but Mrs. Hawberk was in the habit of talking as if Adela were her uncle&rsquo;s  acknowledged heiress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must leave his money to somebody,&rdquo; she told her  husband, &ldquo;and why not to Adela? After all these years of estrangement he will never  take Sibyl into favour again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing so sure to happen as the unexpected,&rdquo;  said Mr. Hawberk, sententiously. &ldquo;You had better not reckon Adela&rsquo;s chickens before  they are hatched. Your brother is not obliged to leave his money to anybody. He  may leave it to a hospital, as many such old curmudgeons do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no occasion to call my brother a curmudgeon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never given me any reason to call him anything  else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and he never understood each other. As for Adela,  he likes having her at Place, and there can be no doubt he is very much attached  to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village party was quite as successful as the genteel  party, and Moppet was a much more prominent personage in the schoolrooms than she  had been the night before at Penlyon. Her whole heart was in this rustic entertainment.  Her eyes shone like stars, her cheeks were flushed with delight. The pretty little  schoolhouse, with rooms for schoolmaster attached, had been built thirty years before  by Sir John, soon after he came to his own, and everything about the building was  sound and neat and trim. The Christmas-tree was in the boys&rsquo; schoolroom, the tea-party  was in the girls&rsquo; room. The children were to know nothing about that glorious tree,  or that noble collection of toys for distribution, till after tea, when the lights  were to be suddenly extinguished, and the door between the two schoolrooms was to  be opened, and the tree was to be seen with all its fairy-like tapers burning.</p>
<p>It would be a thrilling moment, and Moppet&rsquo;s heart beat  fast as she thought of the children&rsquo;s rapture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have they never seen a tree?&rdquo; she asked Adela&mdash; &ldquo;never,  never, never?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they have never seen one. There are so few great  houses about; and there have been no children at Place for the last twenty years.  These poor little things have never had any gaiety, except the rector&rsquo;s summer treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they couldn&rsquo;t have a Christmas-tree in the summer,  could they?&rdquo; mused Moppet. &ldquo;That would be simply silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moppet held office on this occasion. She was to distribute  the presents, assisted by the schoolmaster, who would tell her the names of the  children and advise her choice. There was to be no long-bearded necromancer this  evening. Mr. Danby did not think it worth while to disguise himself, remembering  how little notice the genteel children had taken of his robe or his beard, and how  all their thoughts had been centred on the tree and the toy-box. These children  would no doubt be even more stolid and unimpressionable.</p>
<p>There they were at tea, solemnly munching, solemnly  handing in their mugs for more of the steaming brew &mdash; tea ready milked and sugared  in a huge urn; no nice distinctions as to sweetness or non-sweetness, no study of  individual tastes: hot, sweet, milky tea for everybody. The buns were the feature  of the feast. The piled-up dishes of bright yellow cake were not neglected; but  the buns were first favourite. Moppet could not have believed so many buns could  disappear in so short a time. It was almost as good as seeing a conjurer dispose  of live rabbits. The cake dishes were half full when the meal was finished; but  not a bun remained.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a darkness, and one simultaneous  &ldquo;Oh! oh!&rdquo; arose from the children, while such vulgar words as &ldquo;Lawks!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo;  floated in the steamy atmosphere. And then the door was opened, and the tree was  seen, and instantly saluted by a tremendous clapping of hands and a thunder of hob-nailed  boots as the children all trooped into the next room.</p>
<p>Oh, it was a noble tree! It looked ever so much larger  here than in the great hall at Penlyon    Place. The head of the fairy on the topmost branch  brushed against the schoolroom ceiling as she swayed to and fro, waving a beneficent  wand.</p>
<p>The crackers were a source of rapture, and Tom Smith  was the hero of the evening. Laddie was in his element, letting off crackers all  over the schoolroom with cottage boys who had never seen a cracker before, and who  cried <i>&ldquo;</i>Crikey!&rdquo; or &ldquo;My!&rdquo; whenever one  went off. Laddie did not expect another toy; but he was determined to have a good  go in at the crackers. Lassie, the prim little lady, stood close against Adela Hawberk&rsquo;s  skirt while these ruder festivities were going on, not relishing that odour of corduroy  and boot leather, which is inevitable in such company. But Moppet was moving from  child to child in the friendliest way, handing the toys allotted to each, explaining,  patronizing, altogether mistress of the situation, a Lady Bountiful of two feet  high, flushed and feverish with pleasure.</p>
<p>While the excitement was at its highest point Sir John  appeared suddenly in the doorway. Moppet flew to him in a moment. It seemed as if  he always exercised the most powerful attraction for that young person. She gravitated  to him as surely as the apple falls to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it lovely?&rdquo; she asked him. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they happy?  Ain&rsquo;t their faces red?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ain&rsquo;t yours red, Moppet! Why, you are in a high  fever. I think you had better sit on my shoulder and see the fun, instead of running  about in this black hole of Calcutta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the sharp evening air outside, the atmosphere  of the schoolroom seemed like the heat of an oven. The toys were all distributed,  the box was empty, and all the dolls had been unhooked from their perches on the  waving green boughs. Only the impossible golden fruits and gold and silver fish  and flags remained, and the tapers were expiring in smoke.</p>
<p>Moppet sat on Sir John&rsquo;s shoulder surveying the crowd,  each child engrossed in its own pleasure, examining its booty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, boys and girls,&rdquo; said the schoolmaster, &ldquo;three  cheers for Sir John Penlyon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; remonstrated Sir John; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nothing to do  with the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remonstrance was useless &mdash; the loud chorus arose about  him deafeningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for Miss Hawberk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More cheering; loud and shrill, treble and bass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for Mr. Danby, who is always so kind to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More and more cheering, much louder, much shriller,  as from hearts overcharged with warmest feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for the little girl who gave out the toys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another special cheer &mdash; final at least for the party  from Place, for Sir John turned and fled, with Moppet sitting on his shoulder; but  more cheering sounded through the winter darkness from the schoolhouse behind them  as they hurried along the frosty road through the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a happy evening it has been!&rdquo; said Moppet  from her perch on Sir John&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>And now you are ready for Bedfordshire,&rdquo;  said Mr. Danby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Uncle Tom. I am not the littlest bit sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of this energetic asseveration, Moppet was  discovered to be fast asleep when the party arrived at Place, and in that unconscious  condition was undressed and put to bed, and knew nothing more till next morning,  when she awoke bright and fresh, and greatly astonished that it should be tomorrow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>
<p align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/Chap07.jpg" width="425" height="379" alt="chap07"></p>
<p>There could be no doubt about Moppet&rsquo;s affection for  Sir John Penlyon. It was not cupboard love. Self-interest had nothing to do with  it. The child&rsquo;s young fancies centred in the grave elderly man who had so kindly  and protecting an air when she nestled by his side in his roomy armchair, or squeezed  herself close up against him at the breakfast or the luncheon table. Sir John would  have been more or less than human had he not been flattered by this preference.  She liked him better than she liked Danby; yet she had known Danby for the whole  of her little life, and Danby was her slave, would crawl on all-fours for her, simulating  anything zoological she might choose to order, would carry her on his shoulder for  a mile on end, and studied her desires in the toy world with a reckless disregard  of expense. She was fond of Danby, but not so fond as she was of Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so very grand,&rdquo; she explained always, patting  her new friend on his shoulder.</p>
<p>She seemed to have a precocious appreciation of this  personal grandeur, for certainly Sir John Penlyon had the grand air which impresses  society in general. To Moppet&rsquo;s fancy he absorbed into himself all the dignity of  his surroundings &mdash; the portly black-coated butler, the handsome liveries and powdered  heads of the footmen, the space and splendour of the house, the wide-reaching park  and grounds, and those farms which stretched so far away that Moppet, asking ever  so many times in a morning walk, &ldquo;Are all these fields yours?&rdquo; had hardly ever been  answered in the negative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like the Marquis of Carabas, only it&rsquo;s all  true instead of fibs,&rdquo; said Moppet.</p>
<p>And in her small half-conscious way Moppet admired the  baronet&rsquo;s tall, erect figure, his handsome features, the grey hair and beard, and  the strongly marked black eyebrows which gave such character to the face.</p>
<p>Once when some discussion as to personal beauty arose,  Moppet expressed herself decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very pretty,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;quite the prettiest  of us all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to be as pretty when you grow up, Moppet?&rdquo;  he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, you silly man. I am going to be a young  lady, and wear frocks like hers,&rdquo; pointing to Adela&rsquo;s low bodice. &ldquo;How funny I should  look with a beard like yours!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John accepted her flatteries laughingly, and owned  to Danby that the little hireling amused and interested him; but he questioned his  friend no further as to her belongings. He seemed content to accept her as a waif  from afar, who was to vanish out of his home as quietly as she had entered there,  leaving no trace behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to go home on the seventh day of the new year,&rdquo;  she informed him gravely one morning, in a pause of his letter-writing.</p>
<p>It was her privilege &mdash; obtained by sheer persistence  &mdash; to sit in his room while he wrote his letters. She pledged herself to silence  and stillness, and she would sit upon her hassock in a corner by the fire, playing  with her dolls for an hour at a time, without a word spoken above a whisper, so  low that not a sound reached him at his writing-table; but, looking at her sometimes,  he would see the little red lips moving rapidly, and he knew that an elaborate make-believe  conversation was going on between Moppet and her dolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be glad to go away?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry to go away, but glad to go back to mother,&rdquo; she  answered, looking up at him with clear, truthful eyes. &ldquo;Will you be sorry when I  am gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I shall, Moppet; but I shall have to get  over it. I have had to get over worse sorrows than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One day Adela Hawberk came into the drawing-room excitedly,  in the quiet quarter of an hour before dinner, when the children had vanished into  the deep silence of Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, I have just made a discovery,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed? And what may that be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moppet is the living image of the Shrimp Girl &mdash; not  so pretty, but extraordinarily like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you only just found that out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only five minutes ago, coming through the gallery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen the likeness for a long time,&rdquo; replied  Sir John, quietly, &ldquo;and I think&rdquo; &mdash; with a curious emphasis&mdash; &ldquo;Danby must have observed  it also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby blushed, but held his peace, and the butler&rsquo;s  announcement of dinner closed the conversation.</p>
<p>The Shrimp Girl was a fancy portrait of Sir John Penlyon&rsquo;s  great aunt Priscilla, by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and almost as famous as the Strawberry  Girl at Summerley.</p>
<p>Well-informed people who were shown over Place House  always made a point of asking to see the Shrimp Girl. It was a picture that had  been written about by art critics, and it had been exhibited some winters ago among  the old masters at Burlington House.</p>
<p>The little girl was painted sitting on the sands, in  a reddish-brown frock, with bare head and bare feet, a shrimping net in her hand,  a gipsy hat with blue ribbons lying by her side. A pretty rustic picture of a not  particularly pretty child, in the painter&rsquo;s grandest, boldest, most supremely natural  manner; and the little girl looked almost as much alive as Moppet herself.</p>
<p>There was a likeness, undoubtedly. The dark grey, deep-set  eyes, the overhanging forehead, and sensitive mouth, the dimples and mutinous smile  were all suggestive of Moppet; but when the subject was reopened by Adela later  in the evening, Sir John would not allow any discussion about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All children of the same age and complexion are alike,&rdquo;  he said curtly; and Mr. Danby plunged into the conversation with an entirely new  theme.</p>
<p>There were no more complaints about a green Christmas  after that evening in the schoolhouse. The first fall of snow had been the herald  of a severer winter than had been known in that western extremity of England  for at least ten years.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page187.jpg" width="518" height="750" alt="page187"></h3>
<p>The young people were glad and the old people were sorry.  For the young there were the novel pleasures of skating and hockey on the ice; for  the old there was the fear, and in many cases the reality, of bronchitis; and fuel  was dearer, and life was harder by as many degrees as the quicksilver sank in the  thermometer.</p>
<p>For one little person in this big busy world that wintry  season seemed a time of unalloyed delight. Moppet&rsquo;s little red legs trotted over  the hard roads and along the narrow footpaths which the gardeners had swept in park  and gardens, almost always trotting beside other and older footsteps, the little  red woolly hand almost always held in the warm grip of Sir John&rsquo;s buckskin glove,  age and childhood consorting in a curious companionship.</p>
<p>Together Sir John and his little friend visited all  the striking features of the neighbourhood. They stood together upon Tintagel&rsquo;s  wind-blown height, and watched the white-breasted gulls holding their parliament  on the long low lines of smooth dark rock round which the spray danced and the emerald  green water tumbled so merrily. Moppet loved those bold and perilous heights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be afraid if I was here quite alone, or even  with Miss Hawberk,&rdquo; she explained; <i>&ldquo;</i>but  I&rsquo;m not a bit afraid with you;&rdquo; and indeed the tenderest and most experienced of  nurses could not have been more careful of a tiny charge than was Sir John Penlyon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever have any little girls of your own?&rdquo; Moppet  asked him one day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Moppet, once upon a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did you love them very, very, very much,&rdquo; with  intense emphasis, &ldquo;ever so much better than you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love cannot be measured off-hand, Moppet. It is a long  time since I had any little girls of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad of that,&rdquo; said Moppet; and Sir John  was glad that she asked no further questions.</p>
<p>He took her to Pentargain Bay, to see the seals, and  would have been very pleased to show her those creatures had there been any on view;  but as there were none visible to the naked eye he could only tell her about the  ways and habits of the seal tribe: and he took her down to the beach and prowled  about with her between the caves and the sea, and she was full of interest and excitement.</p>
<p>Playing quietly in the library next morning while Sir  John wrote his letters, he saw that she had made a kind of tent of <i>Whitaker&rsquo;s Almanack,</i> and had put three or  four old gold seals &mdash; those ponderous gold and cornelian seals of the eighteenth  century &mdash; in this tent, and was contemplating them with evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What new game is that, Moppet?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am playing at seals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those seals are not a bit like the animals I told  you about yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, only I can make believe they are nice  soft hairy animals, with funny blunt noses, living on land and in water. They are <i>seals,</i> you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>&ldquo;</i>That is a tremendous stretch  for your small imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Small imagination, quotha! The dark, deep-set eyes gazing  up at him indicated a power of imagination rare even among men and women.</p>
<p>The ice on the pond in the park was pronounced to be  in perfect condition one bright morning, and Adela Hawberk gave herself up to the  delight of skating with a little party of genteel youths from the neighbourhood.  It was an ice carnival in a small way. Hot drinks and other refreshments were sent  from Place House. The villagers came to look on. Mr. Danby was in his glory cutting  figures upon the ice, and taking care of the children, who had a slide in a corner,  upon which they slid and tumbled untiringly, with much noise of shrill voices and  happy laughter. It was nearly dark when they all went back to the house, Moppet  upon Danby&rsquo;s shoulder. There was only time for a very noisy tea, at which Moppet&rsquo;s  excitement and conversational powers were tremendous &mdash; before the journey to Bedfordshire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope the sea will be frozen by the time we are home  with mother,&rdquo; said Moppet, as she was carried off.</p>
<p>Laddie and Lassie went back to the pond next day with  Miss Hawberk; but Moppet was reported to have a cold, and was kept indoors. She  did not rebel against this decree, but was quite contented to sit on her hassock  in her favourite corner by Sir John&rsquo;s fireside, with her dolls and Christmas toys  spread about her on the hearthrug.</p>
<p>Looking up now and then from his letters, Sir John saw  that she was not as busy with her dolls as usual. She sat very quietly, with her  head leaning against the marble column of the chimney-piece, and her favourite doll,  the one she had christened Mary, lying in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my Moppet is not very well to-day,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I&rsquo;m very <i>well,</i> but I&rsquo;ve got a little cold. People don&rsquo;t take powders for colds,&rdquo;  she added hastily; &ldquo;they only stay indoors and keep themselves warm. I am very warm,  thank you.&rdquo; She screwed herself still closer into her snug corner by the fire, and  he saw her eyelids droop heavily over the tired eyes.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page197.jpg" width="476" height="750" alt="page197"></h3>
<p>Certainly Moppet was not quite herself to-day. Her eyes  were very dull, and her voice was thick; but everybody knows that these are the  common symptoms of the common cold. Sir John would not allow himself to be uneasy  about an everyday childish ailment.</p>
<p>When the luncheon gong sounded she told him she did  not want any dinner, and would rather stay where she was. He compromised the matter  by ordering a tray to be brought, and the old housemaid Sarah appeared with roast  mutton and rice pudding, and tried her best to coax the child to eat; but Moppet  stuck to her text.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you, Sarah; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s very nice, but  I&rsquo;d rather not have any of it till to-morrow,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>The day wore on to evening, the premature evening of  those dark days after Christmas, and still Moppet sat in the corner fast asleep.  Sir John had taken the velvet pillows from his sofa, and had made a luxurious little  nest for the child in the angle of the projecting chimney-piece &mdash; a warm nook where  the fire-glow could not scorch her face. Here she slept &mdash; breathing very heavily  &mdash; till Mr. Danby came to look for her at afternoon tea-time.</p>
<p>The footman came in with a lamp immediately after him,  and Sir John started up from his forty winks in his big armchair on the opposite  side of the hearth. He had been giving himself a holiday in the dusk of the evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Moppet,&rdquo; said Mr. Danby, kneeling down beside  the child. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you ready for tea? Why, what a cosy little bed you have made  for yourself, and what a lazy little puss you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyelids were lifted languidly, the dark grey eyes  looked at him wearily, as if they hardly recognized the familiar face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any tea,&rdquo; said the small voice, piteously.  &ldquo;I want to stay here. Please go and take care of the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She coughed with a short dry cough that alarmed Mr.  Danby&rsquo;s ear. He knew much more about children and their ailments than Sir John Penlyon,  old bachelor though he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid my Moppet is ill,&rdquo; he said gravely, lifting  the weary little figure into a chair opposite Sir John&rsquo;s, where the lamplight shone  full upon flushed cheeks and swollen eyelids.</p>
<p>He felt the little wrist. Alas! the pulse was galloping  faster than any horse in Sir John&rsquo;s stables had ever galloped &mdash; galloping on the  road that leads to wild fancies and strange delusions and all the terrors of fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; cried Sir John, bending over Moppet, and  thoroughly scared by this time, &ldquo;the child&rsquo;s forehead is burning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt the little languid hands. They too were scorched  with fever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing very bad,&rdquo; exclaimed Moppet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often  been feverish before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the little choking cough which interrupted even  this short speech, the quick panting breath, and the vivid crimson flush gainsaid  Moppet&rsquo;s reassuring words.</p>
<p>Mr. Danby took her up in his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must go to bed this instant,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better  send off at once for the doctor, Jack. I&rsquo;m very sorry to have brought this trouble  upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry the child should be ill,&rdquo; said Sir John,  ringing the bell furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t be unhappy about me,&rdquo; gasped Moppet, as  she was carried off, looking back at Sir John from the threshold, and waving a hot  little hand in affectionate leave-taking. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to be very bad &mdash; children  are so soon up and down, you know &mdash; but I&rsquo;m afraid I shall have to be poulticed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poultices were the word. Before midnight the whole household  was concerned about Moppet&rsquo;s poultices. The doctor had been at Place three times  since tea-time, and a nurse had been telegraphed for, and was to arrive from Plymouth  next morning; for Moppet was down with acute congestion of the lungs, and as the  evening darkened into night, the symptomatic fever began its dreary effect upon  the childish brain, and Moppet&rsquo;s wits were wandering in strange places, and strange  visions were passing before those shining glassy eyes, which seemed to see nothing  of the real people about her bed, the serious upper housemaid, who put on the poultices,  or Adela Hawberk, always ready with lemonade for the thirsty lips, or the doctor  bending gravely down to listen to the laborious movement of the chest, or to take  the patient&rsquo;s temperature.</p>
<p>Little French phrases dropped from the dry lips now  and then, and it was clear that the child fancied herself in France again. And very often there were  appealing cries to mother, which smote Sir John&rsquo;s heart with intolerable pain, as  he stood just inside the door of the spacious bedroom, hidden from Moppet by the  tall four-leaved screen which sheltered the bed from the hazard of draughts.</p>
<p>The little life was trembling in the balance, he told  himself, though the doctor had sounded no note of alarm, had indeed been quite cheerful  about his small patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rather a sharp attack,&rdquo; he told Sir John. &ldquo;But  children generally take kindly to congestion of the lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This child is so fragile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fragile! Not a bit of it,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Nicholls.  &ldquo;Wiry, not fragile. There&rsquo;s a great deal of brain, rather too much brain, perhaps.  The dull child has always a better chance than the clever child. But I hope this  one will do very well. It&rsquo;s all a question of nursing. The trained nurse will be  here to-morrow morning &mdash; and in the mean time all my instructions are being carried  out by Miss Hawberk and the maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were thus distinctly assured that there was no  danger; yet nobody at Penlyon seemed inclined to go to bed that night. One o&rsquo;clock  struck with the sound of ghostly solemnity which belongs particularly to the single  solitary stroke of the first hour after midnight; two o&rsquo;clock struck, and Sir John  and Mr. Danby sat reading by the drawing-room fire, pretending not to know how late  it was.</p>
<p>At half-past two Adela came fluttering in to tell them  that Moppet was asleep; very feverish still, and still with short and painful breath,  but sleeping. That was in itself cause for rejoicing.</p>
<p>After this hopeful news Sir John discovered the lateness  of the hour, and he and Mr. Danby bade each other good night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry the child is ill, for your sake, Danby,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I know how fond you are of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I could not be fonder of her; and it may be my  fault that she is ill. I hate myself for having kept her so long in that east wind;  but she was so happy, she was enjoying herself so thoroughly. I never dreamt of  danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk of danger. Nicholls says she will be better  to-morrow, and if she isn&rsquo;t better we&rsquo;ll get some great man from London. But I have faith in  our Boscastle doctor. He has a great deal of experience and plenty of sound common  sense, and he has no antiquated notions. But we&rsquo;ll telegraph for a physician to-morrow  morning, even though the child be better. We won&rsquo;t waste time,&rdquo; added Sir John,  uneasily.</p>
<p>It was wonderful to see him so strongly moved by the  waif&rsquo;s illness, he who was supposed to have outlived every gentle emotion.</p>
<p>He sent his telegram by a mounted messenger before seven  o&rsquo;clock, a telegram addressed to Dr. South, the famous children&rsquo;s doctor, entreating  him to travel by the express from Waterloo  which would arrive at Launceston before six o&rsquo;clock. A carriage would be waiting  for him at the station to bring him over the moor to Penlyon.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page205.jpg" width="637" height="750" alt="page205"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have the highest authority,&rdquo; Sir John said to  Mr. Danby, who came into his room just as the servant carried off the message. &ldquo;We  must not have to reproach ourselves with neglect, if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence, but bent over his writing-table  to arrange the papers which he had thrust aside when he wrote his telegram.</p>
<p>It was not seven o&rsquo;clock yet, and the master of Penlyon Place was in  his dressing-gown. His valet would not come to him till eight; but sleep had been  impossible, and the only relief was in moving about his room by the ghastly morning  candle-light, while Danby, who was fully dressed, stood looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby!&rdquo; cried Sir John, presently, stopping in his  slow pacing up and down; &ldquo;you look as if you hadn&rsquo;t been in bed all night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t &mdash; much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby, you&rsquo;re a fool &mdash; a fidgety old fool. You heard  what Nicholls said about children &mdash; they generally take kindly to congestion of  the lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I heard him &mdash; and I have heard her breathing.  One might take kindly to a wolf sitting on one&rsquo;s chest, but one would rather not  have him there. Take kindly! That&rsquo;s a doctor&rsquo;s phrase for struggling through a painful  malady. The child survives where the adult might succumb; but in the mean time there&rsquo;s  acute suffering to be borne somehow. And Moppet is so patient! One feels angry  with Providence  &mdash; for punishing &mdash; such a &mdash; little creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby escaped hurriedly from the room, but Sir John  heard something like a sob before the door shut behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What fools we are!&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;All this fuss and  anxiety about a child, when all the London  slums are choked with children whose future maintenance is problematical! One child  less or more upon this teeming earth! What difference ought that to make? A creature  that has only just begun to think and to feel! Why, less than five years ago there  was no such thing as Moppet; and now I believe Danby thinks the world would be empty  without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby! Was it only Mr. Danby who was so foolishly anxious  about that little life struggling with illness? Who was it who walked up and down  the terrace in the early morning, watching for the coming of the doctor? Who was  it who followed the doctor to the door of the sick-room, and waited outside in the  corridor till he came out again; waited with aching heart and a sick dread of hearing  bad news?</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page209.jpg" width="587" height="750" alt="page209"></h3>
<p>The news was bad. Mr. Nicholls found Moppet worse to-day  than yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would like a second opinion&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have telegraphed for Dr. South,&rdquo; Sir John answered  curtly, &ldquo;and have had his reply. He will be here this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page213.jpg" width="568" height="750" alt="page213"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I can have no objection to meet a man of  Dr. South&rsquo;s distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Objection! As if this country doctor&rsquo;s feelings, and  the petty restrictions of medical etiquette, were to be studied when that little  life was wavering in the balance &mdash; weighed in a balance so fine that a hair might  turn it.</p>
<p>Oh that long, dreadful day of waiting and suspense!  Mr. Nicholls came many times in the day, indeed he only drove hither and thither  on hurried journeys to see his other patients, and then came back to Penlyon Place, making  that his head-quarters. The child showed no signs of improvement as the day wore  on. There was a hush throughout the house, almost as if death were already there;  while Danby and Adela went about with pale faces, too restless and anxious for settled  occupation of any kind. Their talk was all of the child, and of different cases  of childish illness out of which the patient had come triumphantly. If they had  ever known of fatal cases they did not mention those.</p>
<p>And all through the sunny morning and the short afternoon  Laddie and Lassie were at play on a little lawn in front of the library, and a  long way from the sick child&rsquo;s room, a spot whence no sound of those shrill young  voices could reach her. They had one of the women servants to look after them, and  to see that <i>they </i>did not catch cold; and  they had their shuttlecocks and battledores, and bats and balls and hoops, from  their treasury of Christmas gifts, and were as full of life and spirits as if there  were no such thing as suffering in the world. Sir John almost hated these small  egotists, flushed and happy under the cloudless blue of a bright winter sky, Lassie  skimming across the little lawn like a scarlet bird, Laddie skipping and bounding  about like a boy on wires, never still.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page215.jpg" width="716" height="750" alt="page215"></h3>
<p>Sir John looked so worried when they approached him  that Mr. Danby, quick to read all his old friend&rsquo;s feelings, ordered their early  dinner in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room instead of at the family luncheon-table. They were  treated all through the day as if they were in disgrace, and nobody took any notice  of them. Towards evening they grew fractious and fretful, and began to feel really  sorry that Moppet was ill, or that things in general had become uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to go home to mother,&rdquo; said Lassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So should I,&rdquo; agreed Laddie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fun being here  when there&rsquo;s only servants to play with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shan&rsquo;t have such nice dinners when we go home,&rdquo;  mused the girl. &ldquo;We shall have rice puddings some days, and potato soup some days;  but not always fowls, and tarts, and cream, and junket, like we do here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares?&rdquo; cried the boy, with a dash of defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You care &mdash; very much!&rdquo; retorted his sister, with vigorous  assertion. &ldquo;It is a story to say you don&rsquo;t. You know you&rsquo;re much the greediest of  us. You quite <i>love</i> your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do you! So does everybody that is hungry; everybody  except mother. She never cares. She likes us to have all the nice things, and pretends  she doesn&rsquo;t want any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so, squabbling, but not unfriendly, and talking  to each other through the open door between the two rooms, Laddie and Lassie dropped  asleep, and their brief day was done; while to those elders below stairs, who waited  for the London physician, it seemed hardly evening.</p>
<p>Sir John sat in the library, just where he had sat when  the notion of the Christmas hirelings was first mooted, with the monthly time-table  of the London and  South-Western Railway open on his knee. He had looked at it a dozen times within  the last hour to see how soon Dr. South could arrive.</p>
<p>It was night when there came that thrilling sound of  carriage wheels &mdash; thrilling when every nerve is strained in expectation of some  particular guest &mdash; and Sir John went out to the hall to receive the doctor. Then  came the examination of the patient, and then the consultation within closed doors.</p>
<p>How long, how infinitely long it seemed to those who  waited! Danby, Adela, and Sir John were in the drawing-room, having given up the  library to the doctors. They sat with the door wide open, listening for the opening  of that other door, which should announce the end of the consultation. It would  be like the entrance of the jury after a trial of life and death. They were waiting  for the verdict; waiting to know whether Moppet was to die.</p>
<p>At last the door opened, with the sonorous sound of  a massive oaken door two hundred years old, and the two doctors came across to the  drawing-room where Sir John stood waiting for them on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Dr. South gave a faint sigh before he answered that  monosyllabic question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child is gravely ill,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We are going to  do all that can be done. Mr. Nicholls thoroughly understands the case. There has  been no time lost, no measure omitted. But I cannot disguise the fact from you &mdash;  the child is gravely ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Nicholls told us that children generally take kindly  to inflammation of the lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The generality of children. But this is a peculiar  child &mdash; a child of a very excitable temperament, with a preponderancy of brain.  The mind here tells against the body. Everything will be done, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  is danger!&rdquo; interrupted Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is danger. I should do very wrong not to  admit that. Has the child no mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not for a moment did the physician mistake Adela Hawberk  for the child&rsquo;s mother, though Adela might have been taken for any age between twenty  and twenty-five, and thus might seem quite old enough to be the mother of Moppet.  The doctor&rsquo;s keen eye saw at a single glance that this pretty young lady in the  evening frock was not the sick child&rsquo;s mother. She was anxious and tearful and sympathetic;  but the white despair, the agony of suspense and terror &mdash; that look of the wild  animal at bay, and ready to fight for the menaced life of her young, which he knew  in the mother&rsquo;s eye, was lacking here. This pretty young lady was bound by no such  close tie as motherhood to the little creature struggling for breath in the room  above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The little girl&rsquo;s mother is living,&rdquo; answered Mr. Danby.  &ldquo;Ought she to be sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. I hope she is not very far off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last sentence sounded like Moppet&rsquo;s death-warrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought she was in France,&rdquo; muttered Sir John, with a curious  downcast look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she is in London by this time. I telegraphed to her yesterday.  I told her the child was ill &mdash; but not dangerously ill &mdash; and that she had better  come as far as Plymouth,  in case of any change for the worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you know where to find her in Plymouth?&rdquo; asked Dr. South.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she will expect a telegram at the post-office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Then get your message despatched as soon as you  can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity you didn&rsquo;t tell her to come straight here,&rdquo;  said Sir John.</p>
<p>Mr. Danby accepted the reproof in silence. Sir John  led the way to the dining-room, where dinner was waiting for the traveller from  London and the household  doctor.</p>
<p>Dr. South was to spend the night at Penlyon, and was  to be driven to Launceston next morning in time for the earliest train. There would  doubtless be a change in the patient by the morning, either for better or worse.  If the change were for worse, it would most likely be the last change of all, and  the mother would arrive too late to clasp her living child even in a farewell embrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby!&rdquo; exclaimed Sir John, severely, when he and his  old friend had gone back to the library, &ldquo;in God&rsquo;s name why did not you tell the  mother to come straight through as fast as rail and coach could bring her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not like,&rdquo; faltered Danby. &ldquo;I had no right to  summon her to this house without your permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have asked my permission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Danby, agitatedly. &ldquo;I wanted  it to be spontaneous. I could not introduce the subject&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! what matters it to me who comes or goes while  that child is lying at death&rsquo;s door?&rdquo; cried Sir John, fiercely. &ldquo;I should not see  &mdash; the person. It is of the child I think &mdash; the child only. She was calling her mother  to-day when I was in the room &mdash; so sweet, so loving, so sensible. She kissed me  again and again with her feverish lips as I bent over her bed. She knew me perfectly.  Yet there was a touch of delirium; and she called to her mother as if she were in  the room. That made my heart ache, Danby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the mother will be here to-morrow, I hope. I  telegraphed to her yesterday. After Nicholls had seen the child for the second time,  I fancied he was a little uneasy about her, though he wouldn&rsquo;t own it. So I just  walked into Boscastle and telegraphed to &mdash; the mother. She would be quick to take  alarm, I dare say &mdash; though I only told her that her youngest was laid up with a  severe cold, and she could come to Plymouth if she felt anxious, so as to be within  easy reach. I had a reply a few hours after to say she was leaving for Folkestone  by the boat. She is at Plymouth  by this time, I have no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Folkestone!&rdquo; muttered Sir John. &ldquo;Then the place those  children talk about is Boulogne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is Boulogne  &mdash; a very good place, too, for a widow with a small family. They can live as cheaply  there as anywhere, and in fine fresh air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John made no comment upon this, but sat absorbed  and silent by the neglected fire, and then rose restlessly, walked about the room,  took a book from the shelves, taking pains to find a particular volume, opened,  glanced at it, and threw it aside. His face had a look of listening, and often in  his pacing to and fro he stopped to open the door, and stood for a few moments holding  it ajar, as if waiting for some one.</p>
<p>They had moved Moppet to one of the principal bedrooms  at the top of the grand staircase, the spacious chamber in which the most important  guests had been always installed when there was a house party at Penlyon. This state  room had been aired and warmed and prepared in hot haste for the tiny visitor, when  it was found that Moppet&rsquo;s bad cold was going to be a serious illness. It was chosen  as the largest, airiest room in the large, airy house, and Mr. Nicholls highly approved  the arrangement, though he had not advised it. Laddie and Lassie had their two rooms  all to themselves, and &mdash; light-hearted and forgetful as they were in their morning  play &mdash; in the silence and solitude of the after-bedtime affection prevailed over  egotism, and Lassie and Laddie each shed a few tears for their missing sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll be quite well to-morrow?&rdquo; questioned  Lassie, sitting up in bed, and calling to her unseen brother in the adjoining room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid not. Sarah says she&rsquo;s very bad, and that  when Sarah&rsquo;s little niece had the same complaint she died; but then Sarah&rsquo;s little  niece had a neglectful mother, Sarah says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moppet has no mother at all now,&rdquo; said Lassie, dolefully.  &ldquo;Oh, I wish mother was here! I wish we were all at home. I don&rsquo;t want Moppet to  die. What will mother do if Moppet dies, and she has only us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d be very miserable with only us,&rdquo; replied Laddie,  with a voice that was muffled by distance and bedclothes, and perhaps a little by  sleepiness. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re so big, and mother&rsquo;s so fond of little children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be very, very, very good, and very, very, very  kind to mother if Moppet should die,&rdquo; Lassie said conclusively. And then, after  a pause, she inquired, &ldquo;Should we have to go into mourning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would, of course, because you&rsquo;re a girl. But I  shouldn&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no such thing as boy&rsquo;s mourning, stupid,&rdquo; replied Laddie, awakened  by what he considered a futile question. &ldquo;Fancy a boy playing football in mourning  &mdash; or cricket! But Moppet isn&rsquo;t going to die. There&rsquo;s a doctor from London come to cure her. Sarah  said his &mdash; What is it they give doctors?&rdquo; questioned Laddie, suddenly at fault.  &ldquo;His free &mdash; that&rsquo;s it! Sarah said his free would be two hundred guineas &mdash; down on  the nail. I heard her tell the other housemaid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does &lsquo;down on the nail&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; asked Lassie, more  interested in that mysterious phrase than in the coming of the medical Alcides.</p>
<p>Unable to explain, and really sleepy. Laddie pretended  to be actually asleep. He threw a little extra power into his breathing, and the  imitation soon became reality.</p>
<p>The night wore on &mdash; another night on which people pretended  to forget the hour, and no one thought of going to bed. It was felt that Dr. South&rsquo;s  presence in the house was a tower of strength, a rock of defence against the Great  Enemy. Indeed, Sir John had reason to think so, when, stealing with cautious footfall  to Moppet&rsquo;s room in the dead of night, he saw the physician sitting at the bottom  of the bed watching for the result of his treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. South came down to the drawing-room half an hour  afterwards, and found Sir John and his friend sitting forlornly, far apart, like  people who had nothing to say to each other. It was between three and four o&rsquo;clock.  The clusters of candles on the mantelpiece had burnt down to the suckets, and one  of the lamps had gone out. Adela had been sent off to bed an hour before, very reluctant  to go, and indeed had been met by the doctor in the corridor, in her dressing-gown,  hanging about for news of the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Doctor South, you don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s going to die,  do you?&rdquo; she asked piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re trying very hard to save her, my dear  young lady, and with God&rsquo;s help we may prevail,&rdquo; answered the doctor, gravely; and  with this assurance Adela was fain to be content.</p>
<p>Those clinging arms, and the showers of kisses that  were like the bubbling up of childish love from a deep fountain of tenderness; those  bright eyes and dimpling smiles, had endeared the little hireling to the light-hearted  young woman as well as to the worn-out elderly man.</p>
<p>The night wore on. It was five o&rsquo;clock before the doctor  would go to the room that had been prepared for him, and where the fire had been  made up again and again by the housemaid, who sat up all night to wait upon the  sick-room. Mr. Danby had to remind him of his long journey to-morrow &mdash; actually  to-day &mdash; after his long journey of to-day &mdash; actually yesterday; but Dr. South made  light of the matter. He could always sleep in the train. He made his final visit  to Moppet&rsquo;s bedside at five, and went to bed, leaving instructions that he should  be called instantly if there were any change for the worse.</p>
<p>This night &mdash; with the knowledge of danger staring them  full in the face &mdash; neither Sir John nor Danby went to bed at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Danby,&rdquo; Sir John said vehemently, stopping suddenly  in front of the despondent figure seated far away from the neglected fire, &ldquo;you  had no right to do this thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What thing?&rdquo; Danby asked, looking up at him confusedly.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page229.jpg" width="639" height="750" alt="page229"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;You had no right to bring that little child here &mdash;  and let me love her &mdash; let her grow into an old man&rsquo;s heart. Think what sorrow you  have made for me &mdash; a sorrow at the end of my life &mdash; if she is to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shan&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; cried Danby. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re making a good  fight of it anyhow. I tell you she shan&rsquo;t die,&rdquo; he repeated huskily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going  upstairs now &mdash; just to listen at her door &mdash; I won&rsquo;t go in. I won&rsquo;t risk waking her  with the opening of the door. But I may hear something. The nurse may be stirring,  or the maids may be in the corridor. It is agonizing to sit here, and not know if  things are going well or ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby went out like a ghost, and Sir John waited  in the hall while his slow soft steps ascended the stairs. He came down again in  about a quarter of an hour. He had seen one of the maids, who told him Moppet was  a little less restless than she had been earlier in the night.</p>
<p>He and Sir John made the most of this news, and at the  first glimmer of the grey cold day they both went to their dressing-rooms to make  bath and toilet serve instead of sleep.</p>
<p>Breakfast was to be at half-past eight for Dr. South,  who was to leave Penlyon at nine. Sir John met Lassie on his way to the breakfast-room,  very neat and prim in her warm serge frock, quite the elder sister. Lassie was to  be six in May, a fact of which she informed people gravely, as if she were coming  into a fortune at that date. Six years old! It is not every little girl who is soon  going to be six. Poor little things who are only four look towards that dignified  age across a desert of intervening years. Lassie had learnt to tie her petticoat  strings, and put on her stockings, and even to button her boots, in anticipation  of her approaching dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother says I must be very useful when I am six,&rdquo; she  told her friends.</p>
<p>Lassie ran to Sir John and put her hand into his, looking  up at him piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mayn&rsquo;t we have breakfast with you, as we used to before  Moppet was ill?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t send Laddie and me to the housekeeper&rsquo;s  room. We haven&rsquo;t been naughty, have we, Sir John?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, my dear. You and Laddie are very good children  &mdash; only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped with a troubled air, looking down at the  small face that looked so imploringly up at his, as if he were Providence personified.</p>
<p>He could not tell her that, while Moppet&rsquo;s little life  trembled in the balance, she and her brother were almost hateful to him. If Moppet  were to die he would prefer the world to be altogether empty of children.</p>
<p>The voices and the faces of children would torture him  with bitterest memories and regrets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may come to breakfast with us, Lassie; but you  and your brother must be very quiet. We are all of us anxious and a little unhappy  about your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she will get well, won&rsquo;t she?&rdquo; Lassie asked, with  a touch of deep distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope so, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laddie was skipping about in front of the great hall  window, keenly interested in a solitary fly that was buzzing drowsily and knocking  itself feebly against the glass. Laddie came bounding across to Sir John presently,  and said &mdash; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Please mayn&rsquo;t we have breakfast with you, we had no  cream yesterday morning, how&rsquo;s Moppet?&rdquo; all in a breath.</p>
<p>Sir John frowned upon him darkly and did not answer;  but Laddie, seeing his sister go to the breakfast-room hand in hand with their host,  skipped airily after them, asking no further questions. Adela came down early in  her very plainest tailor-made gown, but with her hair dressed as elaborately as  usual. Harrop, the maid, would hardly have neglected that beautiful auburn hair  in the midst of direst calamity. Laddie and Lassie nestled on either side of the  young lady, and soon began to prattle to her, and to each other across her, in low  voices which grew louder by degrees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you talk so loud you will be sent away,&rdquo; Adela murmured  warningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why mustn&rsquo;t we talk? Moppet can&rsquo;t hear us upstairs  in that big, big room. It&rsquo;s like being in church. Is it always like this when people  are ill?&rdquo; interrogated Laddie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When people are feeling unhappy they like to be very  quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People who are unhappy don&rsquo;t like anything. Unhappiness  is disliking,&rdquo; argued the boy, with the air of an infant Socrates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you unhappy?&rdquo; asked Lassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think she will die?&rdquo; urged Lassie, searchingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no. You must not say such things. Pray be quiet,  children. Dr. South is just going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little movement and talk and a quiet leave-taking.  Sir John and Mr. Danby both went to the hall door to see the physician drive away.  He had done or advised all that science could do for the little girl who was fighting  so bitter a battle, and he left them not utterly hopeless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The outlook is brighter to-day than it was last night,&rdquo;  he said finally; &ldquo;but I mustn&rsquo;t promise too much. We are not out of the wood yet.  Please let me have an occasional telegram to say how she is going on. She is a dear  little child &mdash; a most winning little child. I have seen the loveliest children who  did not interest me half so much as that quaint little face of hers, with the large  forehead and the dark deep-set eyes. I hope her mother will be here to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John did not respond to that last speech, and Dr.  South stepped into the useful station brougham and was driven away by the useful  upstanding horses. It is a good day&rsquo;s work for any pair of horses to post from Penlyon Place to Launceston  and back again.</p>
<p>The day wore on towards evening without any marked change  in the sick-room. Moppet was living and suffering and Dr. Nicholls and the nurse  were carrying out Dr. South&rsquo;s thoughtful treatment with the utmost care. All that  science and forethought could do for the child was being done, as Mr. Danby remarked  at least a dozen times in the course of the day.</p>
<p>He was walking with Sir John on the terrace early in  the afternoon when the carriage that had taken Dr. South to Launceston drove up  to the hall door. The coachman had been ordered to watch the arrival of trains for  a strange lady who was to come from Plymouth,  and to bring that strange lady to Place. Mr. Danby had given the man his instructions  as to the style and appearance of the lady for whom he was to look out.</p>
<p>The bell rang, the carriage door was opened, and a lady  alighted, a tall slim figure in a dark cloak, a pale face under a neat black bonnet,  Mr. Danby stood hesitatingly as she went quickly up the steps, he and Sir John being  distant from the door by about twenty yards.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page237.jpg" width="850" height="698" alt="page237"></h3>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to her?&rdquo; asked Sir John, sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; yes &mdash; of course &mdash; yes. But won&rsquo;t you see her &mdash;  before she goes to the child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See her? No!&rdquo; with his darkest frown. &ldquo;Why should I  see her? She comes here to see her child &mdash; for that and for that alone. Go and look  after her, Danby. You must consider her your guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby gave him a distressed look, and was hurrying off,  when he stopped suddenly and went back to Sir John, fumbling in his waistcoat pocket  as he drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said agitatedly, &ldquo;there is something I ought  to have thought of before that lady entered your house.&rdquo; Taking a folded paper out  of his letter-case, &ldquo;Your cheque. There it is; and it has never left my pocket since  you gave it to me. The hiring was a fiction &mdash; I wanted you to know those children  &mdash; and I planned the thing on the spur of the moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wanted to break my heart,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;and  it&rsquo;s quite likely that you will realize your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. I wanted to prove to you that you have a heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go and look after your friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Danby went one way, Sir John the other, and the  cheque to bearer for one hundred guineas was torn up and scattered upon the thin  cold air.</p>
<p>Deep and deeper into the heart of the park, where the  wind-blown oaks all leant away from the west, went Sir John Penlyon, full of grief  and anger &mdash; grief for the child who might die, anger against the friend who had  brought her there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The meddling, officious fool! I was happy enough. I  had got over the wrench that I felt when that shameless girl disobeyed me. My life  was barren, but it was peaceful. What more did I want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did he want now? Only the little clinging arms  round his neck, the soft little cheek pressed against his own, the silvery little  voice prattling gaily to him &mdash; inquiring, philosophizing, laying down the law, as  if the four-year life were full to the brim of wisdom and experience. He wanted  Moppet. He cared nothing for the tall young woman whom he had seen pass hurriedly  under that dignified portal which she was never to have passed again. His affection  had concentrated itself upon this morsel of humanity, brought into his house by  a trick &mdash; a ridiculous trick of this interfering wretch Danby.</p>
<p>Moppet&rsquo;s mother was sitting by her bedside. Moppet was  better already. Only the sight of the familiar face, only the touch of the motherly  hands, had done her good. This was the account which Adela gave Sir John when he  went back to the house after dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mother seems quite a nice person,&rdquo; said Adela.  &ldquo;She has very sweet manners, and must have been very pretty, but of course her every  thought is devoted to that dear little thing. There has been no time for talk of  any kind. She won&rsquo;t come down to dinner. Mr. Danby has arranged that she shall have  the dressing-room opening out of Moppet&rsquo;s room to sit in, and the bedroom next to  Moppet&rsquo;s to sleep in. We shan&rsquo;t see her down here yet awhile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better,&rdquo; said her uncle, curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can quite understand what a bore it must be to  you to have a perfect stranger brought into your house,&rdquo; said Adela, with a sympathetic  air.</p>
<p>The days wore on, and Sir John saw nothing of the stranger.  Nor did he see Moppet. Mr. Nicholls advised that the child should be kept as quiet  as possible. There should be no one in her room but her mother and the nurse. The  sensitive brain needed repose, after the long nights of fever and delirium. Moppet  was improving; that was the grand point. &ldquo;We have turned the corner,&rdquo; Mr. Nicholls  announced delightedly on the third day after the mother&rsquo;s arrival. <i>&ldquo;We</i> have fought a hard fight, and we are  going to win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upstair maidservants were almost hysterical with  gladness when the news was passed along the corridor and in and out of the rooms  where neat housemaids in pink cotton frocks were sweeping and bed-making. Mr. Danby  went about the house with a step as light as Mercury&rsquo;s; and everybody began to be  kind to Laddie and Lassie, who had suffered a season of snubbing, and had been made  to feel that nobody wanted them; except just in that ten minutes at bedtime, when  their mother came to their room, and heard them say their prayers, and hung over  their beds, with innumerable good-night kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we go and see Moppet? May we play with her again?&rdquo;  asked Lassie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite yet. Lassie. She will have to eat a few more  dinners first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t mind that,&rdquo; said Laddie; &ldquo;she is very fond  of dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t love it as you do,&rdquo; remonstrated Lassie.</p>
<p>Sir John Penlyon left for Plymouth directly after the doctor&rsquo;s cheering  announcement. He had business in Plymouth,  he told Mr. Danby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the mother to leave Place now that the child is  out of danger?&rdquo; asked Danby, while his friend was waiting for the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and the mother can please yourselves about that,&rdquo;  Sir John answered coldly. &ldquo;I shall be away for some days. I have to see Barton,&rdquo;  his Plymouth solicitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I may go on to town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she had better stay till the child is well enough  for them all to go home together,&rdquo; Danby said quietly.</p>
<p>Sir John winced as if something had hurt him. Yes, the  child would vanish out of his life &mdash; just as she had entered it &mdash; unless &mdash; unless  he should bring his mind to forget the wrong done him by the daughter he had loved;  forget his stern resolve never to forgive her or to hold communion with her after  that one rebellious act, His daughter had taken her own course without regard for  his wishes. She had chosen the degradation of what to his mind was a low marriage  &mdash; a marriage with a man whose father kept a small, shabby shop in a small, shabby  street: a self-made young man, who had climbed out of the petty tradesman&rsquo;s sphere  by the rugged, narrow path of patronage and help from his superiors &mdash; helped to  eke out the scholarship upon which he tried to maintain himself at one of the least-distinguished  colleges in Oxford &mdash; a dependent at the beginning of his career, a pauper when he  married.</p>
<p>Sir John had remembered how, in the heyday of his youth,  he had crushed down and conquered his love for a girl of humble origin &mdash; how, adoring  her, he had yielded to his father&rsquo;s sentence that for him such a marriage could  never be &mdash; that the future head of the Penlyon family had duties and obligations,  which must go before the romantic love of youth. He had bowed to that decree, and  he had sacrificed the happiness of his early manhood. The landed gentry of Cornwall are a proud race.  The roots of their family trees go down into the dark night of British history,  when Mark was king and Tintagel was a place of royal revelry.</p>
<p>Old as Sir John was, and in spite of the progress that  Liberal opinion had made since Bossiny was disfranchised, he still believed in the  obligations which his ancient race had imposed upon him; and when his daughter married  the grocer&rsquo;s son, he had told himself that he would never forgive her.</p>
<p>During the five years that followed her marriage he  held no communication with her, direct or indirect, knew nothing of her whereabouts.  Letters, pleading passionately for pardon, came to him one after another in the  first year of her married life; but they were torn and flung into the waste-paper  basket, unread, and by and by they ceased to come.</p>
<p>A paragraph in a Plymouth  paper told him of her husband&rsquo;s death in a remote province of Upper India,  where he had been working as a missionary under the S.P.G. He had died of consumption,  leaving a widow and two children.</p>
<p>Sir John sent the paragraph to his family solicitor,  and requested him to communicate with Mrs. Morland, and to arrange for the payment  of an annuity of two hundred and fifty pounds, on the understanding that she was  never to molest her father either by letter or otherwise. He was to hear nothing  and know nothing about her, except that the quarterly allowance was paid.</p>
<p>And this was all he had ever known until Danby&rsquo;s folly  had brought her children beside his hearth, and had betrayed him into loving his  unforgiven daughter&rsquo;s child. Gradually, slowly, the secret of the children&rsquo;s identity  had been revealed to him. Little looks and words of Danby&rsquo;s, Moppet&rsquo;s unmistakable  likeness to the Reynolds picture, the fact of their Indian birth one thing after  another had brought about the revelation, and he knew that the innocent little creature  who had clambered on to his knee and clung about his neck was Sibyl Morland&rsquo;s child.  Well, the situation had been cleverly brought about by his friend Danby; but Danby&rsquo;s  treachery should make no difference. He might be tricked into loving his granddaughter;  but he would not be tricked into forgiving his daughter.</p>
<p>So soon as Moppet should be well and strong again, mother  and children would have to leave Penlyon    Place; and in the mean time it was far better that  he should be away. There must be no opportunity for surprises &mdash; no chance meetings  between father and daughter.</p>
<p>Sir John saw his Plymouth  solicitor, signed a lease, spent a night at the Grand Hotel, smoked a morning cigar  on the Hoe, and went to London  by the afternoon express. He stayed at a sleepy family hotel in Albemarle Street which  the Penlyons had patronized for over a century, and he bored himself exceedingly  next day at the Old Masters, where every Reynolds, Gainsborough, Romney, or Hopner  served to remind him of the Shrimp Girl at Place, and of the little convalescent  who resembled that famous picture.</p>
<p>In the evening he dined with two or three friends at  the Carlton, and  discussed the prospects of the approaching session, which were pronounced of the  gloomiest. He walked back to his hotel through a wintry mist which just escaped  being a fog, and he wished himself back in the clear brightness of the Cornish coast,  where the Atlantic surges make solemn music all night long.</p>
<p>He had received no letter from Cornwall since he left; but he had no right to  be surprised or offended at that. He had asked no one to write to him. He had not  left Place till Moppet was pronounced out of danger; and he had given Danby full  power to deal with the mother and her children. His plan was not to return to his  house until after they had all left. He thought sometimes, almost with a shudder,  how deadly quiet the rambling old house would seem when those young voices and those  busy little feet should be heard in the corridors no more.</p>
<p>He bored himself in London for another day, and went to a small dinner-party  in Grosvenor Square,  where the talk was all of the session and where its prospects were pronounced of  the brightest. Somebody remarked upon the pleasantness of town at this after-Christmas  season, before the opening of Parliament had brought many people back, the only  time in the London  year when small snug dinners and general conversation were possible. Sir John remained  mute, and thought that there could be no place more dismal than London in January.</p>
<p>It was nearly a week after he left Penlyon Place that he  received the following telegram as he was dressing in the morning: &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Moppet has asked for you very often, and has fretted  at your absence, not without danger to her health. Pray come back.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DANBY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Danby again! A trick of Danby&rsquo;s to lure him back to  his house and force on a reconciliation. He was vexed and angry with Danby; but  he read that telegram twenty times over, making now very much, now very little of  it; and he left London by the morning express from  Waterloo, after  telegraphing for his carriage to meet him at Launceston. In those days Launceston  was the nearest station for Boscastle and Tintagel.</p>
<p>A long journey, throughout which &mdash; in spite of the mental  occupation afforded by every newspaper that could be bought &mdash; his thoughts were  haunted by the image of that sick child at Place, and could concentrate themselves  on nothing else. The news of this wide busy world was nothing to him &mdash; foreign or  domestic, rumours of war, earthquakes, cataclysms, a general upheaval, weighed as  thistledown compared with the existence of one small child. She had asked for him,  loving little creature; and he had not been there to respond to her tender yearning.  Those little arms had been stretched out in vain. And she had been sorry &mdash; sorry  even to sickness &mdash; a creature so delicate &mdash; so frail. He hated himself for the iron  pride that had made him leave his house rather than brook the presence of his disobedient  daughter.</p>
<p>It was after dark when he arrived at Place. Mr. Danby  and Adela were in the hall to receive him when he alighted from his carriage. It  was too late for any reasonable man to expect to see children about; yet he felt  a pang of disappointment because there was no sound or sign of a child&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said fretfully, addressing himself to Danby,  after bestowing an automatic kiss upon Adela, &ldquo;your telegram has brought me back,  you see. It the child wants to see me I am here to be seen; but no doubt she is  fast asleep and happy &mdash; dreaming of her doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that. It is the want of happy sleep that  has told upon her. She was doing wonderfully well, the lungs getting quite sound  again, and her strength picking up, when she began to fret at not seeing you. She  was always asking to see you. Where was Sir John? Where was the kind old gentleman?  Why wouldn&rsquo;t he come to see her? Was he angry with her for being ill? We explained  that you were in London,  would be back soon &mdash; but it was no use. However, I attached little importance to  the matter. She was well cared for; she had her nearest and dearest. She would soon  be strong enough to travel. We all talked to her cheerily of the return home. Children  are so fond of change of any kind. It was only yesterday that I began to get anxious,  and that Nicholls began to fear a brain attack. She had slept badly for two or three  nights &mdash; had awakened, frightened and crying bitterly. Yesterday evening she became  very feverish, and in the night she was delirious, and we were all uneasy about  her. Hence my telegram. I hope I did not do wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have telegraphed sooner,&rdquo; said Sir John,  warming his feet at the hall fire, with his back to Danby, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s where you did  wrong. I should like to see the child at once, if she is awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run and see,&rdquo; said Adela. &ldquo;Mr. Nicholls went up  to her room ten minutes ago, so I dare say she is awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she so bad that Nicholls thinks it needful to see  her in the evening?&rdquo; asked Sir John, gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One cannot be too careful in such a case; and Nicholls  is always careful. That child&rsquo;s brain is like touch-paper.&rdquo; Adela came running downstairs.  Moppet was wide awake and dying to see him, she told Sir John.</p>
<p>He waited for no further invitation, but hastened to  that stately room where so many notable men and women of the West country had been  entertained, and which was now occupied by a little figure which seemed absurdly  small in the great carved four-post bed, an antique piece of furniture that looked  like a Buddhist temple enshrining a very small idol under a tall and splendid canopy.  The satin curtains of that ponderous four-poster had been embroidered by the women  of the Penlyon family when homely Anne was queen.</p>
<p>There was a young woman sitting on the further side  of Moppet&rsquo;s pillows, almost hidden by the curtain, and Mr. Nicholls was leaning  against the tall, carved column at the foot of the bed, looking down at the little  creature with the flushed face and over-bright eyes.</p>
<p>She turned her head at the opening of the door as quickly  as a bird.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir John! Sir John! Sir John!&rdquo; she cried, clapping  her feverish hands.</p>
<p>He was beside her in a moment. He leant over the bed  &mdash; not even looking at the face on the other side &mdash; and clasped the tiny form to  his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling!&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;my darling child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away just when I began to get well?&rdquo;  asked the innocent voice, so pure and true in its silver-sweet sound, that it seemed  like the very spirit of truth itself, a something supersensuous and divine. &ldquo;Why  did you go away? I wanted you so badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, Moppet,&rdquo; he asked hoarsely, &ldquo;when you had your  mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I wanted you too. I told you at Christmas I  love you next to mother. And I wanted you very much, and it made me dream and cry  in the night because you wasn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Sir John, you can&rsquo;t play any tune you like upon  such fiddle-strings as those,&rdquo; said Nicholls, gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling! my darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was almost as much as the old man could say. He  sat down on the bed, and Moppet nestled into his waistcoat, as she used to do beside  the library hearth, in the dusky hour before bedtime. She nestled there, and patted  his strong hand with her tiny paw, and laughed and cried in a breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you go away?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows. Because I was a fool, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is mother,&rdquo; said Moppet, plucking the curtain  aside, and revealing a pale sweet face, with timid questioning eyes. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t  know mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir John stretched his hand across the bed, and the  mother&rsquo;s hand clasped it, and the fair pale face bent down over it, and a daughter&rsquo;s  lips kissed it again and again, fondly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you know mother,&rdquo; said Moppet, &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have  never known her if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me, but I didn&rsquo;t be ill on purpose, you know,&rdquo;  explained Moppet.</p>
<p>No other word of peace or of forgiveness was ever spoken  between Sir John Penlyon and his only surviving child; but from that hour Sibyl  Morland assumed her rightful position in her father&rsquo;s house. He was not a man who  liked long speeches or fuss of any kind; and he took no pains to explain to his  kindred or his friends how it was that the daughter who had been lost was found  again; but assuredly that episode of the Christmas hirelings drew him and his old  friend Danby nearer to each other than they had ever been yet, with a friendship  that neither time nor circumstance could weaken.</p>
<p>Mrs. Morland took her place as a daughter in her father&rsquo;s  house, but not the first place in her father&rsquo;s heart. That was occupied. Moppet  had crept into the citadel by a postern gate, as it were, and reigned supreme there.  Sir John&rsquo;s affection seemed to have skipped a generation, and the grandfather&rsquo;s  love for his grandchild was warmer and deeper than ever the father&rsquo;s love had been.  Moppet was his Benjamin, the child of his old age, who had come to him when life  was dull and barren for lack of love.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page257.jpg" width="850" height="693" alt="page257"></h3>
<p>Whoever might ostensibly govern at Penlyon Place, Moppet  was the real master of the house, inasmuch as she governed Sir John. Happily she  was a beneficent ruler, full of sweet carefulness and tender thought for others,  which increased with every year of her life. In all his walks and rides Moppet was  Sir John&rsquo;s favourite companion, taking to her Shelty as a duckling to the farmyard  pool, or trotting with little untiring feet by his side as he made his morning round  of the gardens or the home farm. Before she had been three months at Place she knew  the history, character, and capability of every horse in the stable; and she became  a little wonder in her capacity for remembering and pronouncing the Greek or Latin  names of tropical plants and flowers in the long range of hot-houses.</p>
<h3 align="center"><img src="2200121h-images/page253.jpg" width="607" height="750" alt="page253"></h3>
<p>Laddie was despatched to an excellent preparatory school  at Truro till such time as he should be old enough to go to Eton; and a governess  was engaged to help Mrs. Morland in the care of her two little girls, such a dear  old governess, warranted not to teach too much, and to see that they changed their  shoes, being no other than that very Miss Peterson summarily dismissed by Mrs. Hawberk, and whose dowdy figure moving quietly about  the house and garden made Sir John Penlyon feel as if he were twenty years younger,  by recalling the days when his motherless daughters were little children.</p>
<p>Visitors at Penlyon Place said that Lassie grew prettier  every day, and that young lady&rsquo;s stately manners and graceful little airs were the  subject of much admiration from casual observers, while Moppet&rsquo;s personality was  disposed of off-hand as &ldquo;interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard Lady St. Kew tell her husband that I was a  plain likeness of the Shrimp Girl,&rdquo; she told her grandfather after an invasion of  distinguished visitors. &ldquo;<i>You</i> don&rsquo;t mind  my being plain, do you?&rdquo; she asked Sir John, her deep-set eyes searching his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind? Why in my eyes you are the loveliest little woman  in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hawberk, having made up her mind that her eldest  daughter was to inherit a fortune as Sir John&rsquo;s only niece, was somewhat disappointed  at the turn affairs had taken; but Adela&rsquo;s less worldly nature was incapable of  any such unworthy feeling, and when her uncle helped to bring about her marriage  with the man she loved by a gift of five thousand pounds she felt that she had every  reason to be satisfied and grateful.</p>
<p>And what of bachelor Danby, without kindred or belongings  in the world, drifting lightly down the river of life, like a withered leaf upon  a forest stream? Who shall say that Mr. Danby has neither home nor home ties when  they see the welcome that awaits his coming, the grief that attends his going, at  Penlyon Place?</p>
