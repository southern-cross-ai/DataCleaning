<h2>NOTE</h2>

<p>The publishers have included in this volume <i>The Friends</i>.
Although this story has appeared in book form before, it is one of
Mr. Aumonier's earlier stories which obtained a great <i>succés
d'estime</i> at the time, and was even proclaimed by <i>The
Spectator</i> as one of the best stories they ever remembered to
have read in English, and yet being an early story, it was not
widely read. All the other stories appear here for the first time
in volume form.</p>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. OVERHEARD</h2>

<p>It was nearly two o'clock. The tea-shop was at its busiest.
Clerks, salesmen, typists, shoppers from the suburbs, jostled
against each other in the scramble for buns, tea, sausages, fried
fish, ham or coffee. Everyone seemed hungry and hurried. The
atmosphere reeked with the varied odours of cooked food. Some were
eating greedily, others calling impatiently for their bills or
grumbling at the slackness of the service, or about a draught which
came from undiscoverable places. The slim girl who served some
thirty odd customers in the annexe moved hither and thither with an
overladen tray, which she had to carry twenty yards backwards and
forwards to the serving hatch. Her movements were languid and
listless, but her memory seemed surprising. She would take seven or
eight orders of such varied nature as "large coffee, Cambridge
sausages, roll and butter, and plum jam," to "poached eggs on toast
and a small tea," and she remembered them all correctly and brought
the refreshment to the right persons. She was of indeterminate age,
somewhere round about the thirties, with fair pretty hair, and a
face that at one time might have been almost beautiful.</p>

<p>"Hurry up with my scrambled eggs on toast, miss, I'm going to a
matinee."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>She was studiously polite to everyone, polite but inert. She
seemed to be performing her duties as though mesmerized. Gradually
the crowd began to thin. The clerks and typists had to be back at
their offices, the lady had gone to her matinee, the salesmen to
their clients. As they poured out, queuing up at the pay-desk, a
few late comers straggled in. Among the latter came a young man of
somewhat florid appearance. He was wearing a well-cut blue serge
suit, with a yellow woollen waistcoat, and a felt hat He had a red,
rather coarse face, a httle clipped moustache, and splendid teeth
which flashed as he grinned And he grinned a good deal, as a man
well-satisfied with himself and life in general. He found a seat in
the corner of the annexe and sat down. The slim waitress came along
with her heavily laden tray. She glanced round and her eye alighted
on the young man. Her face betrayed no recognition, but she put the
tray down on the marble slab of an adjoining table with an abrupt
bump. She said "Sorry!" and as she handed plates and cups round she
mumbled:</p>

<p>"Fried plaice, sir? Thank you, sir. Coffee, madam. Thank you,
madam. Two hard-boiled eggs, sir? Thank you, sir," and so on till
the table was served. Then she passed on to the table where the
young man sat. She still carried her tray, for there were two
people there waiting to be served. She put down her tray again and
said:</p>

<p>"Tea, roll and butter, madam? Thank you, madam. Cold roast beef,
sir? Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>The young man looked at her and grinned, but she did not look at
him. Her lips were tight and drawn, and pale. A woman at the table
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Are my kidneys never coming?"</p>

<p>The young man said:</p>

<p>"Well, Florrie?"</p>

<p>Without looking at him she said: "What do you want to eat?" To
the lady she said: "Your kidneys will be ready in two minutes,
madam."</p>

<p>The young man, a little sheepish at his reception, said
quietly:</p>

<p>Oh, well. I'll have some cold tongue and coffee.</p>

<p>"Large or small?"</p>

<p>"Large."</p>

<p>She moved away with her tray, collecting orders as she went,
whilst the young man picked his splendid teeth with a tram ticket.
After an interval she returned. The weary lines of her face seemed
to be concealing the fires of tremulous emotion. She placed the
kidneys in front of the lady, and the coffee and tongue in front of
the young man. Quite mechanically she repeated:</p>

<p>"Large coffee and tongue, sir? Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>She took three more orders, and again vanished.</p>

<p>The young man devoured his tongue and coffee in silence. The
grin on his face became sardonic. It was as though he were saying
to himself: "Oh, well, I don't care." More people went out and
fewer came in. The time was rapidly approaching that sparse half
hour or so that is too late for lunch and too early for tea. The
lady finished her kidneys, powdered her nose, and departed. The
slim waitress was less occupied. She drifted up and down, her tense
pale face expressing nothing. There was only one other person at
the young man's table, a man at the further end reading an evening
paper. At last she came to him. Bending over a cruet which she
pretended to be adjusting she whispered hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Oh, why didn't you come last night?"</p>

<p>The uneasy grin flittered across the young man's face. He
answered in the same key:</p>

<p>"I couldn't. I couldn't get away."</p>

<p>"What were you doing? Spending the evening with Lily?"</p>

<p>"No. I swear I wasn't."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I had to go and see my uncle&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Harrison, there's a customer over there asking for stewed
prunes and rice." It was a tall angular manageress, in a black
frock, speaking.</p>

<p>"Coming, madam."</p>

<p>The mission in search of stewed prunes and rice occupied some
time. And further time was wasted by a customer who said that his
bill was wrong. It was quite true, bhe had charged
eightpence-halfpenny instead of sevenpence-halfpenny for sardines
on toast. The man with the newspaper disappeared. There was no one
else at the young man's table. Once again she leant over the
cruet.</p>

<p>"You don't love her, do you, Harry?"</p>

<p>The young man laughed self-consciously.</p>

<p>"Lord, no. I wanted to tell you, Florne. I've had a bit of luck.
My uncle's coming to the rescue."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He's paying off that debt. And he's going to pay my fare to
Canada."</p>

<p>"Canada!"</p>

<p>She caught her breath, and scraped crumbs into a little pile
with the end of a knife. "Canada! but you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm going to start all over again."</p>

<p>"But don't you want me to go to Canada with yer?"</p>

<p>"You? How could you?"</p>

<p>"I could work my way out&mdash;stewardess or something. I'd go
with You're not going to marry Lily, are you, Harry?"</p>

<p>"Not likely."</p>

<p>"She's not good enough for you, Harry. Oh, God! I believe it's
her what got you going wrong, mixing with all them racing chaps and
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're too good for me, Florrie."</p>

<p>"Hi, miss, order me a boiled egg. And look here, tell 'em it's
to be soft&mdash;not more than three minutes."</p>

<p>"Yes sir."</p>

<p>While she was away the young man fidgetted with his moustache.
He looked like a man eager to escape from an awkward situation. He
gave a jaunty thrust to his hat, which he had never removed. He
drew things on the marble table top with a spoon. At last she came
back.</p>

<p>"You say I'm too good for you, Harry. P'raps in some ways I am.
I go straight, in any case, which is more than yon ever do. But I
don't put much stock by that. I love yer, and that's enough for me.
I'm willing to go with yer&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Perhaps one day when I get on&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, go on! Once you get out there, and you'll forget all about
me. You never did reely love me&mdash;and now that Lily&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I tell you there's nothing in it about Lily."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't let her lead you astray, Harry."</p>

<p>"What do you mean&mdash;lead me astray?"</p>

<p>The tall manageress swept down the room.</p>

<p>"Now then, Miss Harrison, get them cruets together. We shall
have the teas coming in soon."</p>

<p>"Yes, madam."</p>

<p>The room seemed to get dimmer. A queer party of country people
strolled in, the kind of people who demand eggs and bacon at a
quarter past three in the afternoon. What meal is this? breakfast,
lunch or high tea? What did it matter? Outside was the roar of
traffic; inside the low hum of desultory talk. A big man was
leaning across the table, shaking a fat finger in the face of a
doleful individual with a sandy beard, and declaiming:</p>

<p>"I ses to 'im that's not the right and proper way to lay a floor
joist."</p>

<p>Someone wanted to know the right time, and someone else the best
way to get to the Horticultural Show. She thought suddenly of
flowers...great masses of prize blossoms, purple, blue, and white,
and the perfume of them and the memories...</p>

<p>"What fish have you got to-day, miss?"</p>

<p>"Only filletted plaice left, sir."</p>

<p>The young man was getting up, and stretching himself indolently.
She left an order and went across to him. With a little catch in
her voice she said:</p>

<p>"You're going then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What's the good?"</p>

<p>"When will I see you?"</p>

<p>"I'm sailing Saturday."</p>

<p>"Saturday! That's only four days. You'll see me before you
go?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," the young man whispered unconvincingly. "I'll either
drop you a line or call in."</p>

<p>"Promise?"</p>

<p>The promise was give in the same key.</p>

<p>"You'll want your bill. It comes to tenpence-half-penny."</p>

<p>"Thanks, so long, old girl."</p>

<p>There was a break in the wall half-way down the room. When he
reached it they were comparatively alone for a brief moment. She
said fiercely:</p>

<p>"Harry, I've loved yer all these years. Don t be cruel. When I
was&mdash;when I was younger you did care for me a tiny bit. I've
worked my fingers out for you. I've given you my savings. I wasn't
bad-looking once before I came into this business. It hasn't done
me any good. I get tired. The days seem long. You won't&mdash;you
won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man holding forth indignantly about the right way to lay
floor joists, called out:</p>

<p>"Hi, miss, bring me another cup of corfee."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. Coming sir...You won't&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young man's grin struggled desperately to assert itself. He
mumbled something like:</p>

<p>"There, there. It'll be all right. You'll see."</p>

<p>He walked self-consciously to the pay-desk. She went to collect
her tray. Down below in the smoke-room could be heard the sound of
youths noisily playing dominoes and laughing. "There's nothing to
laugh about," she thought at random. The tray was filled with
soiled plates, and cups and saucers, egg shells and sausage skins.
When she emerged once more into the main room, the young man had
gone. She vanished with her tray and in a few minutes returned with
it re-laden. She went to the table where the country people
were.</p>

<p>"Eggs and bacon, madam? Thank you, madam. Eggs and bacon, sir?
Thank you, sir. Eggs and bacon miss? Thank you, miss."</p>

<p>The man of the floor joists bawled out:</p>

<p>"Hi, have you got my corfee, miss?"</p>

<p>She looked at him a little startled, the vexatious expression of
one who takes'a pride in work and is found wanting. She said:</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, sir. I forgot. I'll go and fetch it."</p>

<p>"Damn these waitresses!" growled the man of the floor
joists.</p>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. THE FALL</h2>

<p>The city of Bordeaux is a city of broad avenues, open spaces,
big blocks of commercial buildings, narrow alleys leading down to
congested docks, great wealth, great poverty, great industry. It
has a character widely differing from any other French city.
Broadly speaking, it is a hard-working, thriving, sober place.
People do not go there for pleasure; they go there to trade.
Nevertheless as in the case of all large cities, especially when
they happen to be ports, it is watered by a continuous social flux
that is anything but hard-working, thriving or sober. It holds out
endless temptation to the adventurer, the thief and the garrotter.
The wine industry and the bourse attract the gambler and the
speculator. The constant inflow of ingenuous sailors, blue-eyed and
bewildered, who draw their pay and get lost in the mazes of the
west side, attract the attentions of the more malignant characters.
The cafés and cabarets abound with mysterious individuals, willing
and anxious to introduce the new-comer to the most delectable and
special attractions.</p>

<p>On the whole, Bordeaux is neither better nor worse than her
sister cities of the South. Less sophisticated than Marseilles, she
seems somehow more independent. Further removed from the nerve
centres of France, she contrives to lead a life of her own. The
depressing Landes country does not get on her nerves. She re-acts
to it. And there is always Biarritz, and St. Jean de Luz and the
gay little luxury towns within easy train journey. And there is the
Spanish border and untracked regions of the Pyrenees&mdash;easily
accessible places for the lady or gentleman who suddenly finds that
the only people desirous of his or her company are the very
efficient <i>gendarmerie de Bordeaux</i>.</p>

<p>Max Renault, alias Anton Sachs, alias Jules Destourney, was one
individual who more than once found getting over the border at
Irun, disguised as an old priest, a useful means of evading the
just retribution of the law. On the second occasion he was away two
years, wandering about the north coast of Spain. During that time
his experiences must have been unenviable. He knew little Spanish
and no Basque. The people he moved amongst were mostly beggars
themselves, or poor fishing-folk, living from hand to mouth. He
begged what he could, stole what he could but the conditions of
fife were very hard. He made himself a weird instrument, a kind of
piccolo, put of a cane stem. This he played somewhat unconvincingly
outside cafés and eating-houses; but the Spaniards and Basques are
musicians themselves, and his awards were negligible.</p>

<p>Once he stole a donkey, drove it into the hills, and sold it to
some gypsies for a trifling sum. He travelled far afield after
that, put up at an inn and drank much brandy.</p>

<p>4nd that night he dreamt about falling. We ah have our pet
nightmares, and Jules' pet nightmare concerned falling. It was
horrible. He never actually fell, but he was always just on the
point of falling from some great height. Sometimes he would be on
the roof of a very high building, looking down into the street
below just losing his balance. On other occasions he would be
seated on the front row of a gallery, very, very high up in a
theatre. There was no rail in front of him. His knees were giving
way. The floor below was attracting him. Sometimes he would be
peering over the edge of an enormous precipice, lying on his face
and looking down at the rocks beneath. He would try and edge away,
but an overwhelming power drew him forward. At such moments he
would try to scream, and be unable to. After an endless struggle he
would awaken with a start, and find himsef clutching the
bedclothes, making horrible noises in his chest, and his brow would
be clammy with perspiration.</p>

<p>During those two years he did many reprehensible and desperate
actions, but he always managed to escape detection. At the end of
that time he found himself one day at the little fishing village of
Fuenterrabia, looking wistfully across the bay at his beloved
France. Surely the time was ripe for return. He had changed much in
those two years. The police must have been very busy with other
fugitive gentlemen. He though longingly of Bordeaux, with its rich
merchants and stupid sailors, its familiar cafés and well-cooked
food. Yes, he was a desperate man. Somehow or other he would return
there.</p>

<p>Whilst gazing across the sea, he became suddenly aware of
someone approaching him. Instantly alert, and prepared for flight,
Jules turned. One glance satisfied him that the man was an English
tourist. One of those absurd, comic Englishmen, as drawn in the
French journals. Elderly, with drooping moustaches, rather fat, in
a check suit with baggy knickerbockers and stockings, and thick
brown boots. Round his shoulder was slung a leather strap with
field glasses, and in his hand he carried a camera. The Englishman
spoke to him in broken Spanish, but he seemed to know less Spanish
than Jules. Jules replied in French, which the Englishman spoke
tolerably well. He wanted to know how far it was to Pasaques across
the hills, how long it would take to get there and what sort of
place it was. But yes, of course, Jules smiled ingratiatingly, was
he not himself a professional guide?</p>

<p>It would take perhaps two hours, two hours and a half to
Pasaques. There was no road. It could only be found by one
accustomed to the mountain path. An enchanting
place&mdash;Pasaques, where the famous Victor Hugo lived for some
time, and there was a café there built over the bay with passion
flowers in profusion growing over the pergola. And the patron would
draw you up oysters straight from the river bed in a
basket&mdash;an enchanting place! Why, yes, he would guide the
distinguished visitor that very afternoon and they would return in
time for the Englishman's dinner at the Hotel Miramar.
Excellent!</p>

<p>As they picked their way up the mountain path that afternoon,
Jules was constantly thinking of Bordeaux. It was a steep climb. He
was quite surprised that the fat, elderly Englishman stood it so
well. Surprised&mdash;and angry.</p>

<p>Bordeaux? He wondered whether old Madame Lachaise still kept
that little comestible establishment in the Place Duquesne. There
were friends who would never give him away. There was no one to
fear except the police. Inspector Tolozan? Curse fate! Spit on all
these comfortable people to whom everything seemed to go right.
This fat, prosperous Englishman!</p>

<p>Once on a broken plateau they passed an ox-cart laden with ferns
and a peasant in a blue blouse. They passed no one else in a two
hours' walk. They were cut right off from the world, amidst
boulders of rocks, shrubs, thick masses of fern, distant peaks,
some snow-clad.</p>

<p>"Bella vista, monsieur!" said Jules, pointing across an opening
in the hills. The Englishman leant forward and looked in the
direction Jules' stick was pointing. Bella vista, indeed! There was
a sadden quick movement, and a knife was driven clean and truly
between the Englishman's shoulder blades.</p>

<p>When the convulsions had ceased, Jules dragged the heavy body
into a thick, high clump of ferns, and calmly went through the
pockets. There were a lot of papers that annoyed him intensely,
passports, letters of credit, bills, cheque book, things denoting
wealth but quite un-negotiable. Nevertheless, Jules had little
cause to complain. There were Spanish, French and English notes.
There was a gold watch and chain, a gold cigarette case, loose
silver and various light trifles. He flung the camera away and also
the case of field-glasses, toofcompromising articles to be seen
with&mdash;but stuffed the field-glasses into his breast pocket.
Then he walked on hurriedly for half a mile, crawled under a dwarf
oak-tree and counted the spoil. He rapidly added up the notes,
calculated the total in francs, allowing for the rate of exchange,
and the probable selling value of the watch and chain, etc., in his
own market. He was the sudden possessor of approximately nine
thousand francs!</p>

<p>He cleaned up his hands on some damp moss, buried the knife deep
in the earth and covered that with moss and stones, and set out for
San Sebastian.</p>

<p>Fortune at last had smiled upon him. He gave no further thought
to the ridiculous Englishman, except as an inert piece of matter
that might be compromising under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>He arrived in San Sebastian after dark, weary and footsore. He
knew the town well, and he made for a humble quarter, where food
and lodging would be procurable. He ate heartily, drank good red
wine and much brandy until he fell into a heavy torpid sleep. He
had, however, taken the precaution beforehand to see that he
secured a room in the lodging with a door that locked. Fortune and
security at last! Bordeaux at last!</p>

<p>He swung out into a glorious, rose-hued dreamland of happiness,
only to find himself, after an interval of time, clinging to the
flat surface of an enormous stone column above a square. The column
seemed to be swaying in the wind. Down below tiny figures were just
perceptible on the pavement. The old horror again possessed him. He
was bound to fall&mdash;hundreds of feet&mdash;into that terrifying
void below. It did not occur to him to wonder how he had got there.
The fact that he was there was sufficient. If only the dread thing
would keep still! If only there were any means of descending!
But&mdash;no, he was on a kind of large projecting capital. The
column beneath was narrower. He'peered lover the edge, and saw the
narrowing flutes of the column vanishing into perspective, lost
amongst the stone base hundreds of feet below. There was nothing at
all to cling to. He was falling! He screamed, but the screams were
stifled in his throat. This way! That way! Now he was off!...Oh,
God! He was hanging over the edge of the bed, those choked, ugly
noises coming from his chest.</p>

<p>Ah, thank God! All a dream, all a dream! He would not sleep
again that night. He sat up, drank some water, lighted the candle,
counted his weath all over again, lay there, inert and watchful,
till the light of dawn crept between the crevices of the shabby
curtain. Then he slept quite placidly for several hours.</p>

<p>The sun was shining on San Sebastian when he went out.
Everything was normal and gay. Along the front tamarisk trees with
their soft, feathery outlines, blended into the warm haze above the
bay. Women in black mantillas passed by him, and he did not resent
the fact that their glances were not for him. He wandered about the
town, and bought a ready-made suit, a shirt, a scarf, a new Basque
cap and some canvas shoes. Then he returned to his lodgings,
changed his clothes, paid his bill, took the old clothes away with
him tied up in a paper parcel, and walked to the station.</p>

<p>In two days' time he arrived in Bordeaux, looking like a
respectable Spanish workman. His hair had turned grey during those
two years, and he had grown a moustache and a little stubbly beard.
He made his way to the Place Duquesne, crept stealthily up the
stairs of number seventeen and gave three slow taps on the door,
the last tap being louder than the first. The door was opened a few
inches, and there was a short interval of inspection, and then a
voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Name of God! It's the Jackal!"</p>

<p>He was admitted. The room was occupied by two men. One was a
thick-set, malevolent-looking, middle-aged man, with very dark eyes
and a long scar running from just below the ear to the middle of
the throat. The other was a frowsy old man, with swivel eyes,
impossible to focus. It was the younger one who had admitted him.
He turned to the elder, and said:</p>

<p>"Do you hear, Uncle Sem? It's the Jackal!"</p>

<p>The old man appeared to be searching the ceiling. He
muttered:</p>

<p>"The Jackal&mdash;eh! Where have you been, my brave Jackal, all
these years?"</p>

<p>"Over the border, Uncle Sem."</p>

<p>"What have you come back for, fool? To compromise us? Don't you
know it's the Widow for you if they catch you?"</p>

<p>"I was bored. Uncle Sem. I had to come back. I was
lonely&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Imbecile!"</p>

<p>"He's all right," interjected the younger man, known as La
Tonnerre. "Look at him, uncle! His mother wouldn't know her darling
boy. The Jackal was always a good workman, Uncle Sem. How have the
dice fallen, old boy?"</p>

<p>"Badly," answered Jules. "Pigs and stones. There's not a sou to
be scratched from the vile, evil-smelling swine. Nothing came my
way, until last week, when a fool of an Englishman fell into my
mouth. See here!"</p>

<p>And he produced the field-glasses, the gold watch and chain, the
cigarette-case and the other trifles. The older man's eyes regarded
the objects obliquely.</p>

<p>"Any money?"</p>

<p>"Only a few francs."</p>

<p>"Urn!" grunted Uncle Sem, suspiciously. "Travelling Englishmen
usually carry more than a few francs upon them, especially when
they boast such finery as this."</p>

<p>"Letters of credit, cheque books, if they're any good to you,
Uncle!"</p>

<p>"Um. Let's have a glance. Where's the case to the
field-glasses?"</p>

<p>"I threw it away."</p>

<p>"Imbecile! A Zeiss too."</p>

<p>Whilst the old man was examining the watch and cigarette-case,
Jules inquired of La Tonnerre concerning their mutual
acquaintances.</p>

<p>"Where is Barouche?"</p>

<p>"Barouche! He is spending a long vacation out in Cochin China.
There was an unfortunate affair with the cashier of a bank at
Bayonne. Clumsy work!"</p>

<p>"And Anton?"</p>

<p>"Dead. He died quietly one morning at dawn. The blade was too
quick for him!"</p>

<p>"Lisette?"</p>

<p>"No one has seen her since you left. She was last seen walking
on the quays looking into the water."</p>

<p>"Toni Hecht?"</p>

<p>"They have sent him back to Silesia. They did not like his
face."</p>

<p>"Gabriel Foret?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he is still working. But he becomes foolish. Women and
absinthe do not agree with him. Labori died in the infirmary. There
is no one left of our old company except Uncle Sem and myself. You
are welcome, Jules. We want men of intellect and go."</p>

<p>It was not an inspiriting record. Jules felt a craving to escape
from it all. He had been drawn back to Bordeaux by the nostalgia of
old associations. He liked the place, the kind of food to be
procured there, familiar places and people. But the life of crime
terrified him. It was not conscience which troubled him. It was
just the physical dread of&mdash;falling. It was in his blood that
somewhere, at some time, in the prosecution of his nefarious craft,
he would fall. The nightmare would materialize. And yet what was he
to do? About his person he had concealed eight thousand francs.
From the sale of the field-glasses, the watch and cigarette-case,
he would be lucky if he got another two hundred. This was wealth,
comfort and security for a few months. And then what? He could not
afford to go back on his only two pals.</p>

<p>The old man was saying:</p>

<p>"Here, I will see what I can do with the watch and
cigarette-case. You take these glasses, Jackal, and try your luck
on the East side. You were an idiot to have taken these out of
their case."</p>

<p>"The case isn't of much value, Uncle Sem. And it was clumsy,
with a long leather strap attachment, difficult to conceal."</p>

<p>Uncle Sem said nothing, but he blinked vacantly at the ceiling,
stood up, and shuffled towards the door.</p>

<p>"He's a marvel!" exclaimed La Tonnerre, when the old man had
gone. "He must be seventy-two, and he has never made a slip. The
police watch him like cats, and they've never sprung within a metre
of him. I believe he could cast his shadow into the face of the
sun."</p>

<p>Jules sighed. "Let's go and eat," he said. "I have a few francs,
and that vile Spanish food wants forgetting."</p>

<p>They repaired to a quiet restaurant, of which the patron was a
good fellow, not too inquisitive or squeamish about his guests. And
they did themselves well. Soup, a <i>bouillabaise</i>, tripe stewed
in oil with braised Spanish onions, Rockfort and radishes, and two
bottles of good Burgundy. Oh, it was glorious to be back in
Bordeaux!</p>

<p>And Jules kept on saying to himself:</p>

<p>"I mustn't talk too much. I mustn't let on to La Tonnerre that I
have eight thousand."</p>

<p>There is a fascination about spending freely almost as
intoxicating as any alcoholic material which may be the product of
this action. Once he thought at random:</p>

<p>"Why, I've only got to sell those field-glasses to make enough
to pay for this luncheon."</p>

<p>La Tonnere indeed was not unduly aroused. They both belonged to
the school which taught that the great thing in life was to eat,
drink, and be merry, for to-morrow&mdash;Ah! lots of nasty,
unpleasant episodes might happen to-morrow. One might fall for
instance. Clambering about on dangerous peaks there was always that
sickening attraction&mdash;the law of gravitation. Bah! Another
glass, old boy! Glorious to be back in Bordeaux.</p>

<p>The docks were alive with dear familiar sights&mdash;stately
liners, the black hulls of old sailing ships, weather-battered
smoke-stacks of tramps. There was the delicious odour of tar, oil,
hemp, brine and the chestnut braziers on the quays. There were the
familiar figures, wharfingers in blue blouses, foreign sailors, fat
old fishwives with their booths, women selling flowers, stockings
and gingerbread, port officials fussily conscious of their gold
trimmings. This was the place to live in, to lose oneself in. No
one took any particular stock of this respectable-looking man. What
was he? a mechanic of some sort? a small shop-keeper? a ship's
cook? Who cared?</p>

<p>Having parted from La Tonnere, who stated that he had to go and
claim some "commission" that was due to him, Jules wandered
luxuriously eastward. It was early afternoon and the sun was
pleasantly hot. He walked up the Rue Fondaudege and then took two
turnings, sharp to the left, then to the left again. He came to a
narrow middle-class street of shops. Near the end of the street he
stopped in front of an establishment, which bore the name of
Francis Mossel. He entered and produced the field-glasses. A rather
bored young clerk said: "Yes, what is it?"</p>

<p>"Do you want to buy some field-glasses, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"Field-glasses!" exclaimed the young man in a tone that implied
that field-glasses were the very last thing that his employer would
ever dream of buying. Nevertheless he took them in his hand and
examined them.</p>

<p>"Where is the case?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The case is lost!"</p>

<p>The young man's face expressed bored indignation. However, he
disappeared behind a wooden partition with the glasses. In two or
three minutes an elderly Jew came in with the young man. He was
wearing thick spectacles and a black skull cap. He looked hard at
Jules and said:</p>

<p>"Where did you get these glasses from?"</p>

<p>"They belonged to my brother, monsieur, who died."</p>

<p>The Jew looked closely at Jules' face, his clothes, his shoes
and his cap. He made no attempt to conceal his suspicion.</p>

<p>"Where is the case?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't a case. My brother must have lost it,
monsieur."</p>

<p>"When did your brother die?"</p>

<p>"Last year, monsieur."</p>

<p>"This is a pair of new Zeiss field-glasses."</p>

<p>Jules flushed. What the devil business was it of the Jew when or
where his brother died? Why didn't he hurry up and give him the
money! Monsieur Mossel seemed to be meditating. He muttered to
himself:</p>

<p>"Curious...a new pair of Zeiss field-glasses without a
case."</p>

<p>Looking at Jules once more, he said in a melancholy voice:</p>

<p>"How much do you want for them?"</p>

<p>"Four hundred francs, monsieur."</p>

<p>The old Jew turned to his assistant with an expression clearly
conveying the fact that he had long since given up being surprised
at the insolent and extortionate demands made to him in his
profession. He turned the glasses over and over and examined them
more thoroughly. At last he said:</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you twenty-seven francs
for them."</p>

<p>It was Jules' turn to express clearly that he had given up being
surprised at the preposterous offers one was to expect from these
money-lenders. He answered without hesitation:</p>

<p>"One hundred."</p>

<p>"Twenty-eight."</p>

<p>What was the use? He felt a wild desire to be rid of the whole
transaction. The atmosphere of this poky, furtive office frightened
him. He mumbled:</p>

<p>"Oh!...well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave the glasses here and come in later at half-past five, and
you shall have the money. You must sign a written declaration."</p>

<p>Why? He didn't like this aspect of it at all. But something told
him to clear out of that place at the earliest possible moment. A
few minutes later he was thankful for this subconscious warning. He
had just crossed the street when he saw an elderly
distinguished-looking man turn the corner and saunter casually into
Mons. Mossel's shop. It was the last person in Bordeaux he was
desirous of meeting&mdash;Inspector Tolozan, chief of the
<i>gendarmerie de Bordeaux.</i></p>

<p>He never went back for his twenty-eight francs. On the other
hand, he could not bring himself to tell the true story to Uncle
Sem and La Tonnerre. He said he had sold the glasses for ninety
francs, and he shared the spoil with them loyally. Uncle Sem
declared that he was only able to raise two hundred and forty
francs on the watch and cigarette-case. This was also divided.</p>

<p>Jules slept in an attic in the same house in the Place Duquesne
where his two companions resided. He continued to lead a life of
indolence and luxury.</p>

<p>At the end of a few weeks, however, he began to realize that
there was something queer happening to him. His health was not all
that could be desired. The fact was, that the sudden spasm of
luxurious living, after the two years of semi-starvation, was
seriously affecting his digestion. He suffered from attacks of
vertigo. Lying in his attic at night, he would have an abrupt
vision of the courtyard below. Some power seemed to compel him to
get out of bed and go to the window and look down. He would stand
there, clutching the window frame, his face bathed in cold sweat.
The terror was unendurable. After two or three of these experiences
he gave up the attic. He managed to secure a dingy room in the
basement of the house next door.</p>

<p>So far as the prosecution of his criminal practices was
concerned, he was entirely inactive. He had lost his nerve. He made
up elaborate stories to Uncle Sem and La Ton-nerre of exploits
about purse-snatching and confidence tricks. He even handed them
the money as a share of the spoils, anything to buy peace. His
small fortune would not last long at this rate.</p>

<p>Once he dreamt he was on top of a lighthouse, out at sea. A high
wind was blowing, and he was clutching his few remaining notes and
trying to hang on to the smooth stone surface. A sudden, fiercer
gust came and carried the notes away. He looked over the edge, and
saw the notes fluttering on the surface of an angry sea, a hundred
feet below him. Again he tried to scream...</p>

<p>It was Uncle Sem's discovery&mdash;the fat Dutch ship-master,
who went nightly to a little café in the Rue Muyens and got drunk.
He appeared to have money. It was believed that he had on his
person the cash to pay off a ship's company that was expected from
Rio.</p>

<p>"Here is a neat little game we might play together," said Uncle
Sem.</p>

<p>Jules shivered, but he knew there was no escape. They couldn't
understand, these two; they couldn't understand this fear of
falling. On a certain night he found himself entering the Café des
Etoiles. Uncle Sem was whispering:</p>

<p>"This is the table."</p>

<p>They sat down, and ordered two anisettes. Uncle Sem was very
garrulous. After a little while the fat Dutchman entered. He
glowered at them, but took his usual corner seat, and ordered
Schnappes. Uncle Sem bowed to him very politely, and continued to
talk to Jules. After a few more glasses of Schnappes it was not
difficult to engage the Dutchman in conversation, in spite of his
villainous French. They discussed all kinds of subjects, and Uncle
Sem was most entertaining and hospitable, ordering innumerable
rounds of drinks. It was getting late, when La Tonnerre entered the
café. He was very smartly dressed. He looked round the room, then,
approaching Uncle Sem, he said diffidently:</p>

<p>"May I occupy this seat, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"But certainly," replied Uncle Sem.</p>

<p>In a few minutes La Tonnerre was drawn into the conversation,
and somehow or other it got round to the Dutch East Indies. La
Tonnerre said that he had often touched at Sumatra, when a
seafaring man. Curiously enough, Uncle Sem, according to his own
account, had once been manager of a tea plantation at Tebing
Tinggi. Helped by a nudge, Jules said he knew all the islands
intimately. This might have been all very well, except for the fact
that Uncle Sem referred to Tebing Tinggi as being on the northeast
coast of Sumatra.</p>

<p>"Tebing Tinggi!" exclaimed the Dutchman. "Why, it is in the
interior, one hundred and thirty miles west of Pelembeng!"</p>

<p>It is invariably about insignificant trifles that men lose their
tempers. The argument became heated.</p>

<p>"Considering I lived there for two years!" cried the Dutchman,
banging his fist down on the table.</p>

<p>Uncle Sem was equally emphatic and so was La Tonnerre, who
insisted that Tebing Tinggi was in the north. The argument became
more and more acrimonious. At last Uncle Sem said:</p>

<p>"I tell you what, gentlemen. I'm willing to bet. I suggest we
put up a hundred francs each. We all put the notes right down here
on the table. Then we each in turn draw a plan of the island,
indicating the position of Tebing Tinggi. That being done, we
borrow our patron's atlas. I know he has one. And we compare. The
one who has drawn the most accurate plan gets the lot."</p>

<p>"Done!" roared the Dutchman. "On one condition."</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"That we make it two hundred francs."</p>

<p>"I agree," said Uncle Sem.</p>

<p>"Agreed," said La Tonnerre.</p>

<p>"Yes, I agree also," said Jules faintly.</p>

<p>The Dutchman produced a fat pocket-book. He took out two hundred
francs and put the notes down on the table. The others followed
suit. They drew lots for the order of performance. La Tonnerre drew
the first plan. He picked up a menu card and carefully drew a plan
of the island on the back, indicating the position of the disputed
town. The Dutchman, who had drawn second place, snorted with
contempt and was in a fever to get to work. Directly La Tonnerre
had finished, he snatched up the pencil and pored over the back of
another menu card. Very laboriously, with the tip of his fat tongue
pouting between his lips, he made a careful and exact plan of the
island. When he was half way through, La Tonnerre rose and
said:</p>

<p>"I'll get the atlas in the meantime."</p>

<p>He got up and walked out. The Dutchman had nearly finished his
drawing, when Uncle Sem exclaimed:</p>

<p>"My God!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" growled the Dutchman.</p>

<p>"The notes! the notes! That fellow has taken the the notes!"</p>

<p>The Dutchman's eyes bulged. He glared round the table gasped,
put his hand in his breast pocket.</p>

<p>"God in Heaven!" he wailed. "My pocket-book! my pocket-book!
Which way did he go?"</p>

<p>"Good God! he's taken my pocket-book too!" said Uncle Sem.
"Curse him! the thief! the dirty thief! I believe he went out this
way."</p>

<p>And he jumped up and dashed to the door. The Dutchman dashed
after him. Jules was left alone. The thing had happened so quickly
that the other occupants of the café had not time to take it all
in. Besides, in that part of the world they are accustomed to
quarrelling and gambling among seafaring men. It is advisable
sometimes not to be too curious. A waiter came up to Jules and
said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"That stranger who came in went off with my pal's notes," he
replied.</p>

<p>The waiter shrugged his shoulders. Jules got up to follow the
others. Just as he rose his eye was attracted by a face on the
other side of the room. It seemed vaguely familiar. It was the face
of a young man, talking to a girl. What was disturbing was that the
young man was staring at him and quite patently talking to the girl
about him. As he reached the door, he remembered in a flash that it
was the young clerk to the Jew who had bought the field-glasses.
Once through the door, Jules ran as fast as he could until he had
put several abrupt turnings between himself and that sinister café.
He was terribly frightened. His heart was beating against his ribs.
The appearance of the young clerk from the pawnbroker's shop seemed
to be a portentous climax to the sordid adventure. He must keep
clear of that side of the river for some time. He went a long way
round, and avoiding the Pont de Bordeaux, crossed the river by the
railway bridge. His teeth were chattering when he rejoined the
other two in that crazy room in the Place Duquesne. He found Uncle
Sem feeding a fat moulting canary with lumps of sugar, and calling
it endearing names.</p>

<p>La Tonnerre was stretched luxuriously on an old couch, eating
sardines out of a tin. The evening had been a great success. The
Dutchman's wallet had contained seven thousand three hundred
francs.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," said La Tonnerre, "Uncle Sem thinks a little
change of scenery might do us all good. Scatter, Uncle, eh? Wait
till the Dutch pig has had to return to his greasy country. I'm for
the South, I. I know a pair of dark eyes at St. Jean de Luz that
always welcome me, especially when I can slap my pockets, and throw
a franc or two around at random."</p>

<p>"I have an urgent affair to attend to in Paris, my children,"
said Uncle Sem. "Some dear relations I must visit. They miss me
dreadfully."</p>

<p>One eye appeared to be on the door, whilst the other was
searching the opposite curtain-pole. "Tweet! tweet! There's a
little darling! Tweet! tweet!"</p>

<p>Jules sat morosely apart. Where should he go? What should he
do?</p>

<p>"Wherever I go I know that&mdash;the fall is not far off," he
thought. The fall! He was high up now, and there was that courtyard
down below. Oh!...He stood up and pretended to yawn carelessly.</p>

<p>"I shall stay in Bordeaux," he said, and stumbled towards the
door.</p>

<p>"Imbecile!" hissed Uncle Sem, and then he appeared to chuckle
with malevolent glee. "Tweet! tweet! There's a dear little bird for
you!"</p>

<p>It was coming nearer. Ice-cold hands were clutching at his ribs,
drawing him up, preparing to hurl him down.</p>

<p>Three days had elapsed since Uncle Sem and La Tonnerre vanished
from Bordeaux. His pockets were well-lined with notes and silver.
He drifted from restaurant to restaurant, from café to café,
consuming quantities of rich food and wines, which gave him no
satisfaction. The richer the repast the more violent the reaction.
That morning he had seen the young clerk again with the same girl.
They were going out of a café where he was seated. He thought the
girl looked at him, but he could not be certain. He felt too
apathetic to leave. He sat there drinking absinthe, and watching
the door. He was waiting.</p>

<p>But no one came, and after a while he went out. All the
afternoon he wandered about the docks. The familiar scenes had lost
their attraction. He felt impatient for the crisis. This could not
go on indefinitely. It was now early evening. He was seated at
another café in the Rue Maille. The hour when one dines. But no, he
had no desire for food. Even the sight of a glass of absinthe
nauseated him. The thing was too near.</p>

<p>The café was dimly lighted and almost deserted. He was still
watching the door. A few seafaring men passed in and out. Soon it
would be quite dark. Why didn't they light up the café?
Lights...</p>

<p>Two sturdily-built men entered together. One had a paper in his
hand. They glanced round, whispered, and came up to him. The one
with the paper, said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Max Renault, alias Anton Sachs, alias Jules
Destourney?"</p>

<p>Jules did not answer. He lay in a heap, staring at the
well-filled glass.</p>

<p>"We hold here a warrant for your arrest."</p>

<p>Well, what was it? The Dutchman, or&mdash;?</p>

<p>"You are arrested on an extradition warrant from the Spanish
Government, charged with the murder of an Englishman, John Watson,
five kilos from Fuenterrabia, on the afternoon of the 17th August.
Have you anything to say? Anything you say will&mdash;"</p>

<p>The scream came at last. There were none of the choked gaspings
of a dream. The fuddled mists cleared away. He experienced a moment
crowded with the pellucid vision of the onrush of a huge steel
knife! It had come&mdash;the ghastly end. Then the room swung into
darkness, filled with shouts and screams&mdash;his own. Followed a
period of impenetrable blackness, discomfort, and terror.
Frightened to focus...But it came at last. Where was this? Where
was it? He was lying in a bed. A dim light at the other end of the
room revealed other beds&mdash;five of them. A figure in blue was
walking by, clanking a bunch of keys. The air seemed to be filled
with a pornographic roar. Snoring. The other five beds seemed to be
occupied by men determined to snore their way to hell. His heart
was still behaving queerly, but bit by bit the true position was
dawning on him. A gaoler! This must be the prison infirmary. They
had him at last. How did they discover it all? Vultures! The
Englishman, John Watson, an inert piece of matter! The
field-glasses.</p>

<p>"Why did you throw the case away? Imbecile!"</p>

<p>Where was Uncle Sem? Why wasn't <i>he</i> here? He deserved
everything and always escaped. Liar, thief, seducer, murderer,
property receiver...Tweet! Tweet!</p>

<p>What a satisfaction to wring that fat canary's neck! Crush it
under foot! Where was La Tonnerre?</p>

<p>But they <i>had</i> him. That was the fact to be
faced&mdash;they had him at last, Jules Destourney. The Englishman,
John Watson? Ah, God, if he were the only one! The long relentless
arm of the police, the cold, relentless logic of the courts, the
calm, inevitable chain of evidence prepared by Inspector Tolozan,
who had been watching him for years&mdash;what chance had he to
stand against it? It couldn't be faced. Something must be done.
Some exit must be found. He lay there, with eyes half-closed. A
figure in a white overall passed through, other figures, vaguely
occupied.</p>

<p>It must be the middle of the night, The man in blue clanked by
once more. He went to the end of the room and talked with someone
behind a screen. The door had been left ajar. Yes, there was one
thing he could do. Escape!</p>

<p>He slipped out of bed, and was surprised at the ease and silence
with which he glided through that door...like a ghost. In a flash
he was along that corridor, and turned down two others. The place
was all in darkness.</p>

<p>Here and there were piled-up trestles, and planks and short
ladders. Pails of size and lime-wash were lined along the wall.
This must be one of the Superintendent's quarters, being
re-decorated. Without any hesitancy, he opened a door and entered a
room. It was bare, except for more planks and trestles and
lime-wash. The room was lighted by the light of the moon. He crept
to the window. His heart beat violently. The window was not barred.
Across a narrow alleyway was a low stone building, all in darkness.
It must have been the Governor's house. This room was level with
the roof. On one side of the building was an iron spiral
staircase&mdash;a fire emergency staircase. This led to the
Governor's private grounds. As far as he could see on the farther
side was a wall not too high to scale.</p>

<p>But now this alleyway between the room and the roof opposite? It
could be little more than three metres to the stone parapet. He
quickly calculated the length of the painters' planks. One was at
least three metres and a half, or four.</p>

<p>Someone would be coming! He listened at the door. There was no
lock. It had got to be done boldly. He gripped the plank and thrust
it through the open window. Good God it barely reached! He could
not see how far on it was, but not more than the length of his
first finger, he could swear.</p>

<p>It had got to be done. No time to lose. Again he was surprised
at his own agility and nerve. He slipped quickly from the
window-sill on to the plank. Crawl slowly across on hands and
knees, that was the idea. He almost chuckled to himself as he swung
carefully forward.</p>

<p>"They won't get me! They shan't get me!"</p>

<p>He had gone a metre and a half, and then he looked down on to
the stone floor of the alley beneath.</p>

<p>In that brief instant he realized that he had reached the
culminating terror of his life. It was predestination. This was no
dream. He was going to fall! He lay there, completely paralysed
with the certain knowledge of what was to happen. He was actively
visualizing the whole experience. He was half-way across, and he
could go neither backwards nor forwards. The ground beneath held
him pinioned. The stone floor seemed to be sucking him towards it.
He shook with an ague of terror, and at the same instant the plank
seemed to be imperceptibly moving, as though he were rocking one
end off its support. If anyone came they could not save him.
Nothing could save him. He was going to fall!</p>

<p>He wanted to scream again, as in his dreams, but, curiously
enough, the sounds were throttled in his breast in just the same
way. And then the plank distinctly swayed. He fell forward on his
face and clutched it. It turned up on one side. He flung his arms
round it, and fell free, hanging by its narrow edge. And still he
could not scream.</p>

<p>During the horrific instant that followed when he realized that
his strength was feebler than the suction of the ground beneath, he
was still perplexed with the problem of why it was he could not
scream.</p>

<p>The plank slipped from its support on the wall opposite at the
same moment that he lost his grip. His body seemed to drop and
leave his heart where it had been, and his hands clutching the air.
Some part of him was racing madly through space, and the ground was
rushing up to strike the heart which he had left above him. His
consciousness seemed to split up into a variety of vital
activities. There was something rushing through his ears, like the
roaring of a steam engine going through a tunnel. <i>He was
falling!</i></p>

<p>There was a sudden whirling vision of his mother stepping off
the gangway of a boat and saying: "Come on, my little one. Are you
tired then?" There was a hiss of water, the vision of a girl he had
known once at Bayonne, named Lisette. She was weeping into an apron
and crying out:</p>

<p>"No, no, not that! not that!" Other visions crowded
simultaneously&mdash;his brother eating ginger-bread, Uncle Sem,
and the canary which seemed to have reached vast dimensions,
filling up a whole room. There was a fat man in a tweed suit lying
on his face amongst some bushes, and coughing horribly. There was a
half-vision, half-realization, of something bursting, blowing up to
the sky in a horrible explosion of unbelievable violence. A
crystallized instant in which all the anger, all the feral
passions, crashed in an agony of blood...</p>

<hr>

<p>"You think, then, Doctor Lancret," said Inspector Tolozan, as
the two men entered the solemn mortuary, "that there will be no
need for a post-mortem examination of the body?"</p>

<p>"None at all, Monsieur Tolozan," replied the doctor. "The cause
of death was perfectly normal. The deceased passed away quietly in
his sleep as the result of cardiac failure, probably due to the
shock of his arrest and the nature of the charge against him. Such
cases are not at all uncommon, as you know, not at all."</p>

<p>"You yourself were on duty. Monsieur le docteur?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur Tolozan. When the&mdash;er&mdash;deceased was
brought in at 8.20 p.m. he was in a state of coma. We tested the
heart and found it to be in a very bad condition, very bad
condition indeed. He slept soundly until 3.20 a.m. when the
attendant called me to say that number 107 was showing signs of
collapse. I arrived, but we could do nothing. He sank rapidly and
passed away at three minutes past four. Um&mdash;yes, that was how
it was. Are you going to Madame Lombard's reception to-night?"</p>

<p>"No," answered Inspector Tolozan. "No, I am not going."</p>

<p>"You will excuse me, Monsieur Tolozan? I have much to do
before..."</p>

<p>"But, certainly, Monsieur le docteur, and thank you." The doctor
bustled out, and Inspector Tolozan turned once more to the body
covered with a white sheet. He raised the cloth and regarded the
features of the criminal, now immutably set in calm repose.</p>

<p>And there crept into his eyes an expression of pity and wonder.
This analyst of human frailties, this solver of human problems
stood meekly in the presence of a mystery beyond his powers to
solve.</p>

<p>With a reverent gesture he replaced the cloth and went out

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. ONE SUNDAY MORNING</h2>

<p>The iron fingers of habit probed his consciousness into the
realization that it was seven-thirty, the hour to rise. He sighed
as he pushed his way to the surface through the pleasant obscurity
of tangled dreams. And then, oh, joy! his conscious brain
registered the abrupt reflection that it was Sunday. Oh, happy
thought. Oh, glorious and soporific reflection! He sunk back again,
like a deep sea monster plunging into the dark waters of its
natural environment. There passed a long untroubled passage of
time, in which his sub-conscious mind dallied with ecstatic
emotions. Then slowly and reluctantly he blinked once more into the
light of day and knowingness. This re-entry was accompanied by the
pleasant sound of running water. His wife was in the bathroom,
already getting up. Her activity and the sound of her ablutions
added a piquance to the luxury of his own state. Oh, Sunday,
glorious and inactive day!</p>

<p>His mind became busy with the anticipations of his own
inactivity.</p>

<p>Breakfast in bed! When he won the Calcutta Sweep-stake he would
always have breakfast in bed. There was something irresistibly
luxurious about sitting up snugly in the warmed bed, eating toast
and bacon and drinking hot tea that someone else, pottering about
in the cold, had had to prepare. And when one had had breakfast one
was a man, fortified for anything, even to the extent of getting
up.</p>

<p>His wife came back into the bedroom, wearing&mdash;oh, those
funny things that women wear underneath deceptive frocks. He had
been married for sixteen years and the vision of his wife in these
habiliments did not produce in him any great manifestation of
interest. He realized that he wanted his tea, and his interests
were more nearly concerned with the estimate of how long it would
take her to finish dressing and go downstairs and make it. And
after breakfast&mdash;oh, that first cigarette and the indolent
stimulus of reading the Sunday newspaper from cover to cover His
wife was chatting away about the cook-general, who was ill, and he
boomed out a lethargic yes or no according to the decision which he
believed that she expected. Oh, luxurious and delicious
indifference!</p>

<p>She bustled away at last, and he listened entranced to the
distant sound of rattling plates and tea-cups. A pity that Jenny
had to get the breakfast herself, but there I she didn't have to go
to the city every day in the week, and besides&mdash;if was the
woman's sphere. His conscience was serene and satisfied, his senses
aroused almost to exultation by the sudden and insidious smell of
frying bacon.</p>

<p>When she brought the tray he roused himself valiantly to say the
gracious thing, for he realized that the situation was a little
dangerous. His wife was not in too good a temper over this affair
of the fool of a cook. If he was not careful, she would want him to
do something, chop wood or bring up coals, some angular and
disturbing abrasion upon the placidity of his natural rights.
However, she left the breakfast tray without any such disquieting
threats.</p>

<p>He stared at the tray, when she had gone, as a cat may look at a
mouse which she has cornered, realizing that the great charm of the
situation lies in the fact that there is no hurry. At last he
poured himself out a large cup of tea, and drunk it in gulps. He
then got busy on the bacon and the toast. He ate up all the bacon
carefully and thoughtfully, cleaning up the liquid fat with a piece
of bread. He began to feel good. He drank more tea, and ate slice
after slice of buttered toast, piled up with marmalade. At last he
sank back on the pillow replete. Then he reached out and took his
cigarette case out of his coat pocket. He lighted a cigarette and
opened the Sunday newspaper. Then indeed did he reach the
culmination of all his satisfactions. Strange how much more
interesting and readable a Sunday me wspaper is than a daily paper.
A daily paper is all rush and headlines, designed entirely for the
straphanger. The Sunday paper was conceived in the interest of
breakfasters in bed. It is all slow-going and familiar. You know
just where to look for everything, and you almost know what will be
printed there. He first of all read carefully the results of all
the previous day's football. Queer that he should do so, for he had
not played football for twenty-five years, and then very
indifferently. But he had sneaking affections for certain clubs and
he looked eagerly to see how they were faring. Then he read the
General news. Everything seemed interesting; even political
speeches were not too dull, but divorce and criminal cases were
thrilling. He took no interest in literature, drama or music, but
sayings of the week, police court news, foreign intelligence, even
Court chat, absorbed him. He read the advertisements and then the
football news again, knocking the ash off his cigarette into the
tea-cup. Sometimes his arms would get cold holding the paper, and
he would put it down and tuck them under him. He would stare around
the room, and glow with proprietorial delight. Then he would pick
up the paper and start all over again. His splendid reveries were
eventually disturbed by the voice of his wife calling from
below:</p>

<p>"Jim, are you going to get up to-day or to-morrow?"</p>

<p>Dear, oh dear! Disturbing and alarming creatures, women. No
sense of repose, no appreciation of real tranquillity. However, it
must be getting late, and the morning constitutional to give one an
appetite for lunch must not be disregarded. He devoted another ten
minutes to an inert contemplation of the function of rising and
dressing, and then rolled out of bed. He went into the bathroom,
and lighted the geyser for his weekly bath. When the water was hot
enough he drew off some for shaving, and returnedjto the bedroom
for his new packet of safety razors. He caught sight of himself in
the long mirror which his wife used. The reflection was so familiar
that it produced in him no emotion whatever. He felt no misgiving
about the puffy modelling of the face, the dishevelled strands of
disappearing hair, the taut line made by the cord of his
dressing-gown where it met around his middle. He was just himself,
getting up. Besides, no man looks his best first thing in the
morning.</p>

<p>When he returned to the bathroom he was in gay spirits. During
the operation of shaving he made curious volcanic noises meant to
represent the sound of singing. Running water always affected him
like that. The only disquieting element in this joyous affair was
the fact that steam from the bath kept on clouding the mirror. He
kept on rubbing it with a towel, shaving a little bit, then rubbing
again, to the accompaniment of many damns and confounds. When that
was over he pondered for some moments on the question of whether he
should clean his teeth first, or have his bath. As the room was
beginning to get full of steam, he decided on the latter course. He
got in and let himself down slowly, for the water was very hot, and
though his legs could stand it, other portions of his anatomy were
more sensitive. He let in some cold water and settled down with a
plomp. He soaped himself, and rubbed himself, and lay on his back,
splashing gently. Glorious and delightful sensation. If he had time
he would like to have a hot bath every day, but how could you
expect a fellow to when he had to be in the city every day at
nine-thirty? He got out of the bath, hot and pink and shiny. He
dried himself, and cleaned his teeth. There! all the serious side
of getting up was accomplished. During the performance of dressing
he smoked another cigarette. He dressed very slowly, and
deliberately, putting on a clean shirt, vest, socks and collar.
Golly! he felt good. He puffed out his chest, opened the window,
and brushed his hair. He was rather pleased with his general
appearance of respectability.</p>

<p>Now came the dangerous moment. He had to go downstairs. Would he
be able to escape without being ordered to perform some unpleasant
task by his wife? He went down, humming soulfully. In the
sitting-room the fire was burning brightly, but Jennie was not
there. He could hear her bustling about in the kitchen, already
preparing the solemn rites affecting the Sunday joint...no
insignificant ritual. He wandered about the room, touching things,
admiring their arrangement. He picked up two letters, which had
come by the last post the previous night, and read them again. One
was from his wife's sister at Ramsgate, full of details about the
illness of her husband. The other was from a gentleman offering to
lend him any sum of money from £5 to £10,000 on note of hand alone,
without security. He tried to visualize £10,000, what he could do
with it, the places he could visit, the house he could rent on the
top of Hampstead Heath, a few dinners at the Savoy perhaps, a month
in Paris (he had never been abroad). Then he tore the letter up and
went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Er&mdash;anything I can do, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No, except to get out of the way."</p>

<p>She was obviously on edge. Women were like that, especially
first thing in the morning...curious creatures. He picked his teeth
with a broken match, which happened to be conveniently in a
waistcoat pocket. Anyway, he had done his duty. He had faced the
music.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll just go for a stroll round," he murmured
ingratiatingly. He had escaped! A pallid sun was trying to
penetrate a nebulous bank of clouds. The air was fresh and
stimulating. A muffin man came along, ringing his bell. He passed
two anaemic women carrying prayer books. At the corner of the road
"was a man with an impromptu kiosk of newspapers. He hesitated as
to whether he should buy another newspaper. His wife wouldn't
approve. She would say it was extravagant. Well, he could read on a
seat on the top of the heath, and leave it there. But
still&mdash;he resisted the temptation and walked on. The streets
had their definitely Sunday look. You could tell it was Sunday in a
glance...milk, prayer books, newspapers, muffins, wonderful! Dear
England! A crowd of hatless young men on bicycles came racing along
the Finchley Road, swarms of them, like gnats, and in the middle a
woman riding behind a man on a tandem. They were all laughing and
shouting with rather common voices...enjoying themselves though,
off to the country for the day.</p>

<p>"The woman looks like the queen gnat," he reflected. "They are
pursuing her. The race to the swift, the battle to the strong." He
was pleased with the luminance of this reflection. A boy asked him
for a cigarette picture. He shook his head and passed on. Then he
wondered whether...well, he had several in his pocket, but somehow
he felt it would look silly to be giving cigarette pictures to a
boy in the street. He didn't like that kind of thing. It made him
conspicuous. Passers by might look at him and say: "Look at that
fat man giving a boy cigarette pictures." And they might laugh. It
was all very curious, foolish perhaps, but there it was.</p>

<p>He knew he was going to walk up to the top of the heath, and
along the Spaniards' Road, but he never liked to make up his mind
to. He walked there by instalments, sometimes almost deciding to
turn back, but he invariably got there in the end. Besides, what
else could he do? Dinner was not till half-past one. He couldn't go
home, and there was nowhere to sit down. Going up the hill he was
conscious of the disturbance of his pulmonary organs...heart not
too good, either, you know. The day would come when this would be
too much for him. He enjoyed it when he got there. Oh, yes, this
was a joyous place...heartening. He liked the noise, and bustle,
and sense of space and light. Nearly every Sunday for twenty years
he had walked up here. It was where the Cockney came to peep out of
London, and regard the great world, the unexplored vista of his
possessions. He was a little shy of it. He didn't look at the view
much, but he liked to feel it was there. He preferred to watch boys
sailing miniature yachts on the round pond, or to listen to a
Socialist lecturer being good-humouredly heckled by a crowd. Every
Sunday he had pondered an identical problem&mdash;why these public
lecturers always chose the very noisiest spot on the whole heath,
near the pond, amidst the yelping of dogs, the tooting of motor
horns, the back-firing of motor bikes, and the din of a Salvation
Army band. But there it was! This was England, perhaps the most
English thing in all England. There were the young men in plus
fours, without hats, old men with their dogs, red-cheeked women
riding astride brown mares...cars, bicycles, horses, dogs, even
yachts! There were the fat policemen in couples, talking lazily,
their mission being apparently to see that the fiery gentleman by
the pond was allowed free speech...There were boys with kites, and
boys with scooters, boys with nursemaids. Oh, a man's place this.
Many more men than women. Did not the predominance signify
something vital, something pertinent to the core of English
life&mdash;the Sunday joint? It was only the women with cooks who
were allowed to adorn this gay company. And even then&mdash;could a
cook be trusted? Wasn't the wife's or mother's true place basting
the sirloin, or regulating the gas-stove so that the roast shoulder
should be done to a turn?</p>

<p>These reflections caused him to focus his attention upon the
personal equation. What was to be the Sunday joint to-day? He was
already beginning to feel those first delightful pangs of hunger,
the just reward of exercise in fresh air. The Sunday joint? Why,
yes, of course, he had heard Jenny say that she had ordered a loin
of pork. Pork! delicious and seductive word. He licked his lips,
and visualized the set board. It was not entirely a misfortune that
the cook was ill, for Jenny was a much better cook. The pork would
be done to a turn, with its beautiful brown encasement of
crackling. There would be apple-sauce, Brussels sprouts, and
probably lovely brown potatoes. He would carve. It was only right
of course that the master of the house&mdash;the
breadwinner&mdash;should control this ceremonial. There were little
snippy brown bits&mdash;and that little bit of kidney
underneath&mdash;that&mdash;well, one didn't give to a servant for
instance.</p>

<p>He passed the orator once more, and overheard this remark:</p>

<p>"The day is coming when these blood-suckers will be forced to
disgorge. They will be made to stew in their own juice. Look at
Russia!"</p>

<p>Nobody appeared to be looking at Russia. With their pipes in the
corner of their mouths they were looking stolidly at the speaker,
or at the boys and their yachts. Dogs were barking furiously, and
motor horns drowned any further declamation till he was out of
hearing. The two fat policemen were talking about horse-racing. Oh,
wonderful and imperishable country!</p>

<p>He had heard men talk in that strain before&mdash;but only in
the city or in stuffy tea-shops. They spoke with fear in their
hearts. Something was always going to happen. They didn't quite
know what, but it was always something awful, and the country was
just on the eve of it. But up here, amidst these dogs and bikes and
horses you knew that nothing could ever happen to England.
Everybody just went on doing things, making the best of things. The
air was sweet and good. There was the Sunday joint in the offing,
and the Cup Final next Sunday to be discussed.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch and proceeded to walk slowly homewards.
It cannot be said that he thought about anything very definite on
the way back, but his mind was pleasantly attacked by fragmentary
thoughts, half-fledged ambitions to make more money, anticipations
of a masonic dinner the following week, the dim vision of an old
romance with a girl in a tobacconist shop at Barnes. But at the
back of his mind there loomed the solid assurance of the one thing
that mattered&mdash;pork! He played with the vision, not openly but
secretly. After the pork there would be pudding. He didn't care
much about pudding, but there was a very good old gorgonzola to
follow, and then a glass of port. After dinner a cigar, and then
the Sunday newspaper again until he fell into that delightful doze
in front of the fire. Oh, blessed day!</p>

<p>His timing was superb. He arrived at <i>The Dog and Dolphin</i>
at exactly one o'clock, in accordance with a time-honoured
tradition&mdash;the gin and bitters to put the edge on one's
appetite for dinner. The bar was filled with the usual Sunday
morning crowd, some who had risen just in time for the bar to open,
other stalwarts like himself, who had earned their appetiser
through walking.</p>

<p>He was just ordering a gin and bitters when a voice said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, old boy, have this with me."</p>

<p>He turned and beheld Beeswax, a fellow city man. They had known
each other for fifteen years, meeting nearly every day, but neither
had ever visited the other's house. He said:</p>

<p>"No, go on, you have it with me."</p>

<p>They went through the usual formula of arguing who should pay
for the first drink, both knowing quite well that the other would
inevitably have to stand another drink in return. They stood each
other two drinks, making four in all. In the meantime they
discussed old so-and-so and old thingummy, trade, dogs, tobacco and
females. Then he looked at his watch again. Just five-and-twenty
past&mdash;perfect!</p>

<p>"Well, old boy, I must be off or I shall get into trouble with
the missus."</p>

<p>He walked quite briskly up the street, feeling good. Life wasn't
such a bad business to a normal man, if he&mdash;looked after
himself, and on the bright side of things. Pork, eh?</p>

<p>He knocked his pipe out against the parapet in the front garden,
walked up the steps, and let himself in. He hung up his coat and
hat, and was about to enter the sitting-room, when he became
abruptly sensitive to disaster. It began in the realization that
there was no smell of roasting pork, no smell of anything cooking.
He felt angry. Fate was going to cheat him in some way or the
other. He did not have long to wait. His wife came screaming down
the stairs, her face deadly white, her hair awry.</p>

<p>"Jim! Jim!" she shouted, "rush to the corner quick. Fetch a
policeman!"</p>

<p>"What?" he said.</p>

<p>"Fetch a policeman!"</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Moyna. She's dead. I went upstairs an hour ago and found her
lying fully dressed on the floor. The gas-stove was turned on. She
looked awful, but she wasn't quite dead. I dragged her into our
room, and fetched a doctor. He did what he could, but she died.
She's lying dead on our bed. The doctor's up there now."</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't argue. Fetch a policeman. The doctor says we must."</p>

<p>He fumbled his way out into the hall, and put on his hat and
coat again. He knew it was no good arguing with his wife when she
was like that. Damn! How wretched and disturbing
and&mdash;inconvenient. He walked slowly up the street. What a
disgusting and unpleasant job&mdash;fetching a
policeman&mdash;beastly! He found a ripe specimen at the comer,
staring at nothing. He explained the situation apologetically to
the officer. The latter turned the matter over in his mind and made
a noise that sounded like: "Huh-huh."</p>

<p>Then the two strolled back to the house at the law's pace, and
talked about the weather. He found his wife in the sitting-room,
sobbing and carrying on, and the doctor was there too, and another
woman from next door.</p>

<p>"I believe these women rather enjoy this kind of thing," he
reflected, the fires of hunger and anger burning within him. They
all went upstairs and left him to ruminate. What a confounded and
disgusting nuisance! Anyway, what did Jenny want to carry on like
that for about a servant. Who was she? She hadn't been there long,
about two weeks. She was an Irish girl, not bad-looking in that
dark way. He seemed to remember that Jenny said she was married or
something. Some man had been cruel to her, cruel and callous, she
had said. She used to cry. Confound it! Why was it so difficult to
get a good servant? But there it was. Jenny would carry on and be
hysterical all the afternoon. There would be no dinner. Perhaps a
snack of cheese or something on the quiet. Women were absurd,
impossible. You couldn't cope with them. They had no reasoning
power, no logic, no sense of fatality, no repose. It was enough to
make one boil...pork, too!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. THE DARK CORRIDOR</h2>

<p>When the iron door of the cell clicks to, and the convict is
shut in for the night, it is not often that the sound produces in
him a sense of elation. But to them all there is perhaps one
occasion when it does so&mdash;the night before release.</p>

<p>At the sound of that familiar click the mind of Raymond
Calverley instinctively registered the phrase, "The last time!"</p>

<p>When the door was opened again he would be free. The price would
have been paid. Till now he had hardly dare visualize this moment.
There had been whole days, whole nights, whole years when he could
not persuade himself that it would ever come to pass. He felt sick
with agitation. He sat upon the bed and buried his face in his
hands. Free, really, really free! He had been a good sleeper, but
to-night he would not sleep. Memories, fears, anticipations raced
through his brain. In a few hours more he would be facing the
outside world. There was something terrifying in the
thought&mdash;facing the unknown. His sympathies quickened towards
some of those old prison "lags" who, after serving twenty years or
so, preferred prison life. It was, in any case, familiar and
understandable. The outside world to them was completely
bewildering. They didn't know how to cope with it.</p>

<p>But he&mdash;he was only forty-six, and he had only served five
years and three months. Only! Five years and three months! Five
thousand years and three hundred months. There had been moments
during the first year when he thought he would go mad, when half an
hour seemed like an eternity, and he would think:</p>

<p>"That's half-an-hour. Now there's to be another half-hour. Then
another and another and another, and then eventually a whole day,
and a whole night. Then all over again and again and again till a
week passes. Then all over and over again till a month passes. Then
the seasons change. It will be winter again, and then summer, and
then winter again and then summer, and so on and on and on five
times. And I'm changing all the time. The outside world is
changing. All the things I desire are cut off from me. I shall
never endure it. Oh, God!"</p>

<p>But he had endured it. The reality had come to pass. In a few
hours...Of all the manifestations of Nature that which is called
human is the most adaptable. As the years passed he found himself
adapting himself to prison life, creating a life within a life.
There were times when he even persuaded himself that he was happy.
This was largely the outcome of a sense of physical well-being.
Prison life suited him. He had been forced to work out in the open
several hours a day, on the farms, and in the quarries, fourteen
hundred feet above the sea on Dartmoor. The air itself was a tonic.
He had been plainly but adequately fed. He had to retire for the
night at five o'clock. He had been cut off from alcohol, which had
been partly the cause of his undoing. During the last two years he
had been allowed to smoke for half-an-hour twice a day, but that
was all. Everything was regular, ordered, and methodical. He had no
responsibility. He was physically fit, much fitter than he had been
at any time since he left school. For part of the time he had
worked in the carpenter's shop. He had come to like the smell of
wood, and the sense of creating something which was going to be
used. There had been odd moments when the whole atmosphere of the
prison seemed friendly and satisfying. Some little concession would
be magnified into a great act of kindness. He had had opportunities
for reading, and greater ones for reflecting. And his dominant
reflection had been: "I must so manage my mind that I do not
eternally regard myself as a criminal." His struggle for self
respect had been acute. To foster this he took all the trouble he
could with his personal appearance. A wise provision of recent
years allows the convict a safety razor and the liberty to wear his
hair as he likes. Raymond took advantage of this. He shaved every
day, and brushed his grey locks carefully, sometimes even
lubricating them with a little of His Majesty's butter! His skin
was tanned with sun and wind. He would return to the outside world
a better specimen physically. But mentally and morally? here were
greater difficulties. His mind said: "I was guilty. I let things
drift. I was weak and foolish. I saw an opportunity to make a great
sum of money easily. I was dishonest. I was found out. They
punished me. I have paid the price. To this extent I am purged. I
see things more clearly now. I shall not be dishonest again. I have
no desire to be. I have lost the desire in the same way that I have
lost the desire for alcohol. I just want my chance to be a decent
citizen again. But will they let me? What will be their attitude
towards me? Above all&mdash;how can I face my son?"</p>

<p>At this point in his reflections he would groan aloud, for his
son was the mainspring of his life.</p>

<p>Raymond had been an importer of chemicals, with offices in
Fenchurch Street. At the age of twenty-two he had married the
daughter of a wealthy shipbroker. After their first passionate
attachment he and his wife found that their interests did not
dovetail. Had it not been for the son who was born the following
year, it is possible that he and his wife would have agreed to
separate. Not that there was any serious breach between them. It
was simply that familiar cleavage of little things. It took years
to discover that they had little in common, and when the discovery
was made each prepared to make the best of it&mdash;not an unusual
marital position. They had remained on perfectly friendly terms,
and it was only over the upbringing of the boy that they came into
conflict, and even then the contest was conducted without
bitterness.</p>

<p>His wife was a Society woman, with Society interests. She rode,
hunted, played golf, took the waters at fashionable places abroad,
went to church, and backed horses. Raymond liked books and rambling
in the country, and that Society spelt with a small "s" which one
meets in country inns or London taverns. When his wife condescended
to come to London they shared the same house, but they made all
their arrangements independently by mutual consent. But when it
came to the arrangements about the boy, Ralph, they were forced to
compromise. If he wanted the boy in London, she would want him in
Yorkshire. If he wanted to take him for a holiday to Cornwall, she
would want to take him to Trouville. If he wanted him to go up to
Oxford, she would insist on Cambridge. And so the ding-dong race
went on, with Kathleen usually a neck or two ahead.</p>

<p>With his wife usually abroad, and his son at college, Raymond
would have led a lonely life in the large house in Russell Square.
Only there are clubs. He belonged to several and he was a good club
man. Many considered him an ideal club man, being genial, lavishly
hospitable, and a good raconteur. He drifted into the habit of
lunching in clubs, dining in clubs, and calling at clubs between
meals. Like many men of his kind, without being a drunkard, he
drank considerably too much, in the sheer exuberance of social
intercourse. He could afford to be generous, as his business was
successful, and his wife had a large private fortune of her own.
But one day he was tricked by some Argentine gentlemen, and lost a
very large sum of money over a deal in nitrates. The bitterness of
this acted upon him disastrously. He was worried by the
complications arising from it, and he drowned his distress in the
accustomed way. He visited more clubs, and pubs. And unfortunately
in one of these expeditions he met Max Rawle. Max was one of those
people of no determinate age, nationality or profession, who
nevertheless seem to embody all the vices of every age, nation, and
profession, and to wrap up the same in a cloak of irresistible
charm. He was a natural swindler. People knew he was going to
swindle them, and they couldn't help it. They would even forgive
him after the deed was done, so plausible and charming was he.</p>

<p>And under the influence of Max Rawle Raymond became as clay in
the hands of the potter. They lunched and dined together, played
billiards, and went to night clubs. Max was a brilliant talker, and
had lived in strange lands and mixed with strange people.</p>

<p>The trouble had occurred soon after he and his wife had
disagreed about whether Ralph should go up to Oxford or Cambridge.
As usual she had had her way, and Ralph had gone up to Trinity.
Kathleen went off to Biarritz and had no intention of returning
till the end of the term. Raymond followed the easy path and found
himself getting into debt, and his moral fibre slackening. He was
too proud to apply to his wife for money to stabilize his affairs.
And one mad evening Max dangled before him the lure of a mighty
opportunity. It could hardly fail. So ingenious and yet so simple
did the scheme appear that Raymond was astonished that it had never
occurred to anyone before. It concerned the transference of certain
blocks of interests backwards and forwards between two different
companies at the opportune moment, thus giving an inflated
appearance to both. It hardly seemed dishonest in the way that Max
devised it. They were to go shares. But a few days after he had
completed his part of the bargain, Max had disappeared, and nothing
had been seen of him since. Raymond was left in the air. He was
unable to explain his position. A long and involved commercial
trial resulted in his being condemned to seven years penal
servitude for fraud. With a good conduct record this had been
reduced to five years and three months.</p>

<p>But how was he to face his son? His wife had taken the matter
better than he had anticipated. She had even written to him
regularly every three months, formal little letters about the boy
and family affairs. She had upbraided him for not appealing to her
when in financial straits. And had hinted that she would set him on
his feet again when released. The boy had written him chatty
school-boyish letters ignoring his father's crime; his only
resentment being apparently that he had had to leave Cambridge
before he had been up a year. He had been spending his time partly
with his mother, who had settled abroad, and partly with a tutor in
a remote village in Suffolk.</p>

<p>His son! Raymond would lie in his cell bed at night and groan.
He would think of the boy at all the stages of his life. When he
was a toddler and would lie in his arms, when he began to lisp and
talk. When he would run to him and throw his arms around him. He
could hear the sound of that baby voice: "Daddy, daddy!" And then
he taught him all the simple things, and Ralph went to school. How
proud he had been when the boy came home and asked his advice and
help. He would see the little sturdy figure come swinging along the
street, a satchel strapped over his scarlet jersey. His handsome
eager face would light up with pleasure when he saw his father. And
they would go for walks together, holding hands, and talking about
birds, and trees, and games. And the boy loved and respected him.
He also loved and respected his mother, and he could not understand
any differences between them. And so the parents compromised and
patched up a union of sorts, but they were jealous of each
other.</p>

<p>Raymond had loved to watch the unfolding of the boy's mind. He
had loved the steady growth of their greater intimacy. He had
searched fearfully for traces of his own failings and weaknesses.
His greatest desire had been that the boy should be a better man
than he. And everything pointed to his desire being fulfilled.
Ralph was a good boy, unselfish, affectionate, easy-going, and
considerate. He was intelligent, but he did not distinguish himself
very notably at school either at work or play. But what did that
matter? It is often the slow starter who wins the race. Besides, he
would always be well provided for. Raymond knew that his mother had
left everything to the boy in her will, and he did not resent one
penny of it. They would never have any more children. This sense of
security contributed largely to his own undoing. There was no need
to make efforts. As the boy had become more independent, and his
wife more occupied with her own affairs, Raymond became more
detached and irresponsible. His business had run smoothly,
requiring no great personal strain, and it didn't seem very
important whether it succeeded or not. There was no great need for
him to labour, neither did there appear any great call on him to
set an example, when Ralph was at college. The boy had been
launched. He had been handed health, security and good precepts.
Raymond had felt that his obligations to society at large were not
impressive. And he had begun to drift. The weakness was
inexcusable, but it had taken the cold stern experience and
suffering of prison life to make it clear to him. The price had
been paid. He had so managed his mind that he would leave the
prison feeling that he was no longer a criminal.</p>

<p>When the crash had come and he had stood in the dock at the Old
Bailey, and listened to the suave voice of the judge condemning him
to seven years imprisonment, there had flashed before his mind the
image of Ralph's eager young face exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Dad?"</p>

<p>The boy would never believe he was a criminal. He simply could
not understand. It had not been indeed a simple case to understand.
He had been able to make the excuse, but not the defence, that he
himself did not understand. He had muddled things up, signed the
wrong papers. The excuse satisfied the boy of course. But the law
is more explicit. The law gave him every opportunity, left him
every loophole, but was relentless in the logic of its ordered
facts.</p>

<p>But since that tragic day the boy had had five years to study
those facts. He had come to man's estate. People would have told
him, and explained to him, doubtless made things as unpleasant as
possible&mdash;some of them. And he would have wanted to
know&mdash;oh, so eagerly! He would not be likely to exclaim
now:</p>

<p>"What's all this about, Dad?"</p>

<p>Even his voice would have changed. Oh, God!</p>

<p>He dozed fitfully until the morning light crept between the
prison bars, when, strangely enough, he slept soundly, only to be
awakened by the familiar click of the cell door.</p>

<p>"The last time!"</p>

<p>He dressed carefully, washed, and had his breakfast. He was led
to a room where he filled up many forms. Then his clothes were
given him. There was much clanking of chains and keys. Crossing the
yard in charge of a warder he passed a working party on its way to
the farriers. All of the convicts were familiar to him. Many of
them would be there for ten years or more, and in two minutes he
would be free! He shuffled along feeling a little ashamed, as
though he were taking something from them which they had a right to
share. As they neared the outer gate, the warder, a fat elderly
person of the old school, said:</p>

<p>"Well, good luck, son!"</p>

<p>A lump came in his throat at this unexpected friendly gesture,
and he could not reply. A great wave of pity flooded him,
pity...oh, for all the world.</p>

<p>The gate opened. He stepped through into the sunshine. He heard
it click behind him. He was free. He stood for a moment bewildered.
Then he walked a little way up the road. There was no one about. He
stood by a wall and wept, for no palpable reason. He felt curiously
sick, like a man surfeited with rich food.</p>

<p>He had half expected...someone would meet him at the prison
gates. But the street was utterly deserted. His wife knew of the
day of his release and she had sent him money, but no hint of where
she was or where the boy was. It was like starting life all over
again. He was startled by the approach of a tall figure emerging
from a house. His instinct was to run. It was a familiar figure
coming to recapture him. A deep booming voice said:</p>

<p>"Well, Calverley, you're out, then!"</p>

<p>It was the prison chaplain. Raymond blinked and the chaplain
held out his hand. As he held it he realised that this was the
first human hand he had touched for five long years.</p>

<p>"Well, my good fellow, I trust you now to keep straight."</p>

<p>He resented this. Straight! What right had this person to
lecture him&mdash;Raymond Calverley, the man who was no longer a
criminal? Nevertheless he said weakly:</p>

<p>"I shall try, sir."</p>

<p>He wanted to get away. The chaplain made a few more unctuous
remarks, but he did not hear them. He hurried away and walked to
Princetown Station. He had a pass to London, and he sat in the
corner of the waiting-room. The train did not go for nearly an
hour. People regarded him furtively. In Princetown everything is
known. Every porter on the station would know that he was a
released convict.</p>

<p>The journey up was occupied with dreams. Dreams, and hope and
fear, and wild anticipations. Where should he go? His wife had no
house now in town, and he didn't know where she was, nor where the
boy was. Oh, if he could only find Ralph!</p>

<p>He arrived at Paddington late in the afternoon and wandered
around the streets adjoining the station. Everything seemed
incredibly noisy and bewildering. Newspaper placards were
announcing: "Fall of French Government." How futile and
unimportant! Didn't they realize that the only important thing was:
"Release of Raymond Calverley!" He would have been forgotten by
now, although at one time his name had been very much in the public
eye. At last he found a dingy little hotel in an obscure street,
where he engaged a room. Then he had some tea and wandered the
streets again, haunted by the vague idea that he might find Ralph.
He went up to the West End and strolled down Regent Street,
Piccadilly, and Mayfair. At the corner of Jermyn Street he met a
man with whom he had done a lot of business in the past, an old
club-fellow. He touched his arm and said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, Frank!"</p>

<p>The man turned and looked at him. An extraordinary scared
expression came over his face. His eyes distended, as though he
were staring at some strange and dangerous animal. He managed to
say:</p>

<p>"Ho&mdash;yes, it's&mdash;Calverley, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. How are you?"</p>

<p>"All right. And you? You&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm free again."</p>

<p>He tried to smile, but the other man's terrified mien froze the
smile upon his lips. His expression seemed to say:</p>

<p>"How on earth am I to escape from this awful predicament?"</p>

<p>They exchanged a few banal remarks, and parted, without any
reference to the past, or suggestions for the future. As he walked
away Raymond winced.</p>

<p>"So that's to be it, is it!" he thought.</p>

<p>The restaurants were crowded with gay diners. If he cared to, he
could enter any one of them. He was free. He could mingle with his
fellows, and buy rich foods and good wines. But he felt no such
inclination. It was too late. He was not accustomed to feeding
after five o'clock. He did not feel hungry, and drink he knew would
upset him. Moreover, his experience with his old business colleague
damped his enthusiasm for social life. He might meet others who
would treat him in the same way. How could he expect them to know
that he was no longer a criminal? that his mind had been purged of
its weakness and self-indulgence?</p>

<p>He wandered about till nine o'clock when a great sense of
melancholy and exhaustion overcame him. He went back to his hotel,
and to bed. They had given him a room at the end of a dimly-lighted
corridor on the second floor. He slept soundly till dawn, when he
emerged through a tangled skein of dreams to consciousness. It was
as though his own dreams were happy ones, but that they were
eternally interrupted by the evil dreams of others. He washed and
dressed, and finding that it was too early to obtain breakfast in
the hotel, he went out to a coffee stall. He stood there drinking
hot weak coffee, and eating hard-boiled eggs, and listening to a
slightly inebriated gentleman in evening dress talking to two
cabmen about God. The cabmen were laughing, and the coffee
stall-keeper was joining in the argument earnestly. The morning air
had a tang of hope and defiance. He took a hand in the argument and
found himself laughing too. In this company he was happy and at
home. No one knew him or cared. In the old days of his prosperity
he had spent many a happy hour at a coffee stall. Here was
something that had not changed...flotsam and jetsam seeking
good-fellowship at the board of abstract argument. When the
inebriated gentleman and the cabmen had departed he felt fortified
to face his day's campaign.</p>

<p>In the uncertainty of his position he found one tangible
spot&mdash;his wife's lawyers. They would know of her whereabouts
and probably of Ralph's. He had been informed of "their address,
and of the fact that they were empowered to pay him twenty-five
pounds a month until further notice. He wandered the streets again
till ten o'clock his eyes wistfully seeking, and his heart aching
for his son. At ten o'clock promptly he presented himself at the
office of Tidworth, Bates and Mashie in Lincoln's Inn Fields. He
was kept waiting three-quarters of an hour before being shown into
the office of an elderly red-faced man, in a white waistcoat, who
said curtly:</p>

<p>"Yes, what is your business?"</p>

<p>"I want to know if you can tell me the whereabouts of my wife,
Mrs. Raymond Calverley?"</p>

<p>The lawyer looked up quickly, his face expressing a kind of
greedy morbid interest. It had something of the expression of his
business friend of the night before, only less furtive. The lawyer
was in no panic to get away. He had power on his side, and he was
prepared to take a certain amount of cynical-enjoyment out of it.
He coughed and said:</p>

<p>"Oh, so you are Raymond Calverley. Will you please show me your
discharge? I understand that I am to&mdash;er&mdash;make you a
remittance. What is your address?"</p>

<p>Raymond was patient during the formalities. When they were
completed he repeated his first question. The lawyer took a long
time to say:</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I am not empowered by my client to give you any such
information."</p>

<p>Damn the man! Why did he call her "my client" and not "your
wife"? Was the stigma of prison life to rob him for ever of even
the social amenities? Not even to know where she lived? There
flashed through his mind a sudden vision of a night when the
nightingales sang in a Devonshire garden and the swift avowal of
love passed from lip to lip. Could love like that die utterly?
Could passion vanish upon the wind, like the skeleton of a dead
leaf? He repeated inanely:</p>

<p>"Your client. Your client. I see." Then with greater
vehemence:</p>

<p>"Perhaps then you can give me the address of my son?"</p>

<p>The lawyer was enjoying the spectacle of his helplessness. He
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I cannot even give you that information."</p>

<p>Raymond saw red.</p>

<p>"Damn you!" he screamed. "He's my boy. He's as much my boy as
hers&mdash;more, I tell you. Who the devil are you to hold my son
from me?"</p>

<p>"You are a little unstrung, Mr. Calverley."</p>

<p>"Unstrung! If you had been five-and-a-quarter years in
prison&mdash;five thousand years in prison&mdash;your heart aching
all the time for your boy&mdash;and the day you are released some
stranger tells you that he will not tell you where he
is&mdash;wouldn't you be unstrung?"</p>

<p>The lawyer replied in dead level tones:</p>

<p>"I cannot tell where your son is, because&mdash;I do not
know."</p>

<p>"You do not know!"</p>

<p>"No, sir, I do not know."</p>

<p>Raymond gave a whine, like a dog that has been struck. He groped
for his hat upon the table. As he did so his eye alighted on a pile
of correspondence. One letter was projecting a little from the
rest. It was headed: Hotel Marguerita. Pau. Just below was the top
of a capital D. He recognised it as the way Kathleen formed this
letter. His face betrayed no recognition. He stumbled from the
room.</p>

<p>He would telegraph to Kathleen. Would she still be there? The
world seemed terribly harsh. His mind was constantly irrupted by
visions of Dartmoor, and strangely enough they were not unfriendly
visions. Dolling, who was serving twelve years for manslaughter,
and with whom he had had many whispered chats in the carpenter's
shop&mdash;Dolling would be missing him. Two young warders, Garrod
and Purvis, both had done him innumerable petty services. The moors
would be grand under this mottled sky...some queer pull about the
place...when you're utterly lonely.</p>

<p>He went to a post office and sent a telegram to his wife at Pau.
He said:</p>

<p>"Am at Bond's hotel Paddington where is Ralph."</p>

<p>He tried to think of any friend he could go to in the meantime.
He reviewed his old life and it seemed to reflect&mdash;clubs and
pubs! He could never get into a club again, and pubs did not
attract him. The illusory nature of friendships made in this way
became clear to him. He would have to go abroad&mdash;America
perhaps. If only he could find Ralph!</p>

<p>He waited for three days, and no telegram came from Kathleen. He
wandered the streets and sat in public libraries, reading the
newspapers and magazines, and trying to adj ust his mind to the
social question. Human activities as recorded in these productions
appeared to him complicated and futile. In the old days he had not
seen them in this light. Perhaps he had not troubled to think about
them. He had just accepted things as they were. Upon one matter he
made up his mind definitely&mdash;he would find work. He would not
go on accepting his wife's money in this ignominious manner.</p>

<p>On the third day he decided to go down to Ashtree, the village
in Suffolk, where Ralph spent part of his time with the tutor. It
was strange that the boy had made no effort to see him.</p>

<p>He arrived at Ashtree at dusk and left his bag at the local inn.
He then asked for the house of Mr. Flanders, the tutor. With
considerable difficulty he found it. It was over a mile from the
village. His heart was beating violently when he rang the bell. A
servant opened the door.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Flanders in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, what name?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Calverley."</p>

<p>She looked at him a little queerly, but showed him into a
sitting-room. In a few moments a thin elderly man entered the room.
He started at sight of his visitor, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, I thought it was&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then he stopped and scrutinized Raymond keenly.</p>

<p>"I came to ask after my son."</p>

<p>The elder man appeared very surprised. He stammered
slightly.</p>

<p>"Your son? Your son? Yes. Yes, of course, your son. But he went
up to London. He went up to&mdash;er&mdash;meet you, I
understand."</p>

<p>"To meet me! but I haven't seen him. I expected him."</p>

<p>"H'm. Very strange, Mr. Calverley. I'm afraid I can't help
you."</p>

<p>This respectable tutor, whom only poverty had driven to accept
the tutelage of the son of a convict, was obviously anxious to be
rid of the dilemma. With a few formal expressions of regret they
parted. Raymond returned to the inn, and found that there was no
train back to London that night.</p>

<p>He slept fitfully. What had happened to Ralph? Fear gripped him.
He visualized all kinds of terrible things happening to the
boy&mdash;accidents. The cup and the lip...oh, the grim irony of
it! After living that eternity and then on the very day of his
release&mdash;a skidding car perhaps, a train smash, a fall. At
that moment Ralph might lie groaning in a hospital, calling for
him. There was only one gleam of brightness in his sombre
reflections&mdash;Ralph had meant to meet him. The tutor had said
that hepiad gone to London on purpose. Freedom is a fine thing,
butlove is greater than freedom. Indeed, freedom without love is a
negative endurance. Before the dawn broke he had designed plans to
find his son. He would enquire at the police stations and
hospitals. He would put an advertisement in the agony column of the
<i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>And when he arrived in London that was the first thing he did.
He inserted:</p>

<p>"To Ralph Calverley. Am at Bond's Hotel, Paddington.
Father."</p>

<p>He then rang up the police stations and hospitals. No, no one
answering to the description of his son had been heard of.</p>

<p>He walked the streets disconsolately. London suddenly became a
city of menace and despair. The people appeared hard-featured and
cruel, beasts of prey stalking their victims, utterly indifferent
to the feelings and passions of each other. The drone of the
traffic was like the whirring of some great machine, grinding the
bones and blood of men and women into a colourless pulp. He had
never felt so lonely in his cell at Dartmoor.</p>

<p>Backwards and forwards between his hotel and the police station
he walked for several days. No answer came to the advertisement in
the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>One afternoon passing down a meagre street off the Edgware Road,
he saw a poor bedraggled woman weeping on another's bosom.</p>

<p>As he passed he heard her say:</p>

<p>"The y 'im 'cause 'e was out of work and stole for us. And now
they're turning us out&mdash;me and the five kids. What are we
going to do? Oh, my Gawd!"</p>

<p>And he heard the other woman, who was also poorly but rather
flashily dressed, one who wanders the streets, glancing
obliquely&mdash;he heard her say:</p>

<p>"Sorl right, Annie, don't you worry. I'll earn money for yer.
I'll keep yer goin' till things get brighter."</p>

<p>Without a second's hesitation Raymond dived his hand into his
pocket and drew out all the money he had on him, nearly two pounds.
He thrust it into the hands of the weeping woman.</p>

<p>"Go on with this, mother," he said huskily.</p>

<p>The woman stared at him, too amazed to speak. The other
said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, who are you?"</p>

<p>And they looked into each other's eyes, this ex-convict and this
woman who wandered the streets glancing obliquely, and the former
said:</p>

<p>"I'm like you. I'm one of the lonely ones."</p>

<p>And he hurried away. Back in his hotel, he went up to his room
and sat on the edge of his bed, as he had sat on the edge of his
bed in that cell at Dartmoor, pondering, pondering...It was dusk.
The working parties would be returning from the quarries. There
would be whispered talks together, glints of light from the
governor's house, the drone of the organ in the chapel...someone
practising for to-morrow's service.</p>

<p>"Lead Kindly Light<br>
Amidst the encircling gloom."</p>

<p>Oh, the weariness of it all! the injustice! His heart throbbed
to the beat of that haunting melody. In a grey vision he seemed to
see an endless procession walking, two and two, to the slow measure
of that hymn&mdash;all the unhappy in the world, the outcast, and
the weak. His breast was choked with sobs. He gripped the coverlet
of the bed and muttered:</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! oh, my boy, my little boy!"</p>

<p>The room grew darker, outside the traffic still roared
relentlessly. He was about to throw himself on the bed, when the
door opened quietly. A figure glided in and stood with its back to
it. He peered forward, and saw a white ghostly face with hollow
eyes, regarding him fearfully. He tried to stand up but fell back
weakly on the bed. The figure said:</p>

<p>"Is that you, father?"</p>

<p>He stretched out his hands and groaned. The figure came nearer,
and then shrank back again to the door. Raymond forced himself to
rise. He beat the air with his arms, as though fearful that there
were forces at work trying to keep him from his son.</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! oh, my boy, my little boy!"</p>

<p>And as he advanced so did the other shrink back further.</p>

<p>His voice, husky with passion, called out:</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! you're not ashamed of your old father?"</p>

<p>And still the figure cowered furtively by the door. He went
close up and peered into his son's eyes.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ralph? What's the matter? My God! you look as
though it was you who had committed a crime and not I."</p>

<p>The figure still seemed to be warding him off and the voice said
faintly:</p>

<p>"It is I who have committed a crime."</p>

<p>And then the tension broke. The boy sobbed, and the father held
him in his arms at last.</p>

<p>"What is it, Ralph? Tell me. Tell your father, boy. Who should
not hear of it if not I?"</p>

<p>"For God's sake let me sit down. I'm so tired. I've been
wandering all night. I saw your advertisement this morning. And
even then I could not make up my mind to come. I'm so ashamed."</p>

<p>"Ashamed! Am I so pure? Am I likely not to forgive&mdash;not to
understand my son?"</p>

<p>The boy buried his face in his hands and spoke between his
fingers.</p>

<p>"I've been living foolishly, father, oh! for years now. Mother
spoilt me, gave me lots of money. I got into a funny
crowd&mdash;betting, drinking, women. She paid my debts again and
again. Last Tuesday Lcame up from Ashtree. I had meant to go down
to Dartmoor and meet you at the prison gates. But in the afternoon
I met Reggie de Tourneville. He was staying at the Grand Eclipse
Hotel He asked me to dine with him; then we went up to his room and
had a few drinks. Afterwards we went on to some funny joint at
Knightsbridge and played cards. There were a crowd of people there
and we played baccarat, I won a hundred pounds in about twenty
minutes With the excitement of that and the wine I had drunk I
simply went off the deep end. I thought I couldn't lose. I plunged
wildly. I loved the excitement, people watching me, pretty women,
you know, and all that kind of thing. Then of course I began to
lose. My luck varied but at about one in the morning I had lost
four hundred pounds. I hadn't got it in the world. I had borrowed a
hundred and fifty from Reggie. I didn't know where mother was.
Besides, she had helped me out so often. She had left Pau. I think
she was on her way home. I hadn't enough left to pay my hotel bill
or the fare down to Dartmoor. I woke up the next morning feeling
awful I wandered about the streets wondering what to do. And then
I&mdash;I&mdash;"</p>

<p>The father's breath was coming in little stabs.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ralph, what did you do, boy?"</p>

<p>"Oh I mucked the whole day away. I hadn t the the courage. It
was the next day I did it, the day you came out of prison, and I
never met you Reggie had treated me badly, I think. He woifldn t
lend me any more. I'm not sure the whole thing wasn t a plant. They
got me there. There were other young chaps, too Any way, I kept on
thinking of Reggie's room at the Grand Eclipse. When he lent me the
money he had gone to a box which he kept locked up in a trunk. It
was stuffed with notes. Late in the evening of that day I yielded
to temptation. Reggie had gone out to dinner. I went up to one of
the clerks downstairs and said casually:</p>

<p>"'Key of Number 141, please.' You know what those big hotels
are. Nobody knows anything about anyone. There are dozens of
clerks. He gave me the key. I went up by the stairs, and into his
room. I forced the lock of the trunk with a poker, but I couldn't
force the lock of the box. So I simply wrapped it up in paper and
took it away. I took it back to my hotel. Then I borrowed a
screwdriver and some pincers. I got it open somehow. Oh, God! what
have I done? There were bonds and papers and all kinds of things
and nearly three hundred pounds in cash. I never meant to take all
that. I just wanted enough to carry on with."</p>

<p>"What have you done with it?" whispered the hoarse voice of the
father.</p>

<p>"I've spent some of the money. All the other things I ve kept. I
left the hotel, of course, and have gone to another one South of
the river."</p>

<p>"What was the money in?"</p>

<p>"Treasury notes and fives, tens, and twenties."</p>

<p>"Have you changed any of the big notes?"</p>

<p>"I've changed one ten."</p>

<p>"You fool!"</p>

<p>"Why!"</p>

<p>"They'll trace the number. Where did you change it?"</p>

<p>"At Cook's. I've taken a ticket for Paris to-night."</p>

<p>"Would anybody at the hotel be likely to identify you?"</p>

<p>"That's what I'm not sure. There are over a thousand passing
through every day."</p>

<p>"Reggie will suspect you, of course."</p>

<p>"He's bound to, after what happened. Oh father what can I do?
I'm terrified. It means&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It was my fault, boy, my crime which led to it. I should have
been here to look after you."</p>

<p>"No, no, I've no excuse. I'm finished. And oh, father, I've been
so yearning to have you back."</p>

<p>The young man broke down and wept. Raymond pulled himself up. He
paced the room for several minutes in silence. Then he said
tensely:</p>

<p>"Ralph, boy, go and fetch me that box."</p>

<p>"Fetch it! Why father?"</p>

<p>"Listen to me, carefully. This happened on the night I came out
of prison. Fetch me that box. <i>You</i> did not steal that box,
Ralph!"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"These old criminals! It's the same story. It's in the blood.
You can do nothing for them. Directly they are released they start
all over again&mdash;the very same day sometimes. You'll read all
this in the papers in two days' time."</p>

<p>He laughed bitterly, and the young man looked up amazed.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you'd sacrifice yourself for me like
that? Oh, I couldn't let you do it, father."</p>

<p>"Why not? If you strolled into an hotel and asked for a key and
got it, why should not I, an old ex-convict? Besides, I am strong
now. I could endure it. I have nothing more to live for. Your life
is just beginning. But, oh, Ralph, boy, promise me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, no, father, I should go mad with remorse. I couldn't
let you...oh!"</p>

<p>He gave a low scream of fright for at that moment there was a
crisp tap on the door. When the door opened the father was standing
as though at attention on parade, the son was cowering against the
further wall. In the doorway stood Kathleen. They looked at each
other, but no one spoke. Then she turned and shut the door quietly,
and stood with her back to it. Her face was pale and drawn, and it
suddenly flashed through Raymond that in this company of his wife
and his son, he was the only one of flesh and blood. In the crisis
which was about to spring on the three of them, it would be
he&mdash;the ex-convict&mdash;who would have to hold the balance.
Strangely enough she turned to him first, and her voice was gentle.
She said:</p>

<p>"You are free, then, Raymond. I saw your advertisement, and I
came to find out what it's all about. I arrived in England
yesterday."</p>

<p>He bowed his head.</p>

<p>"I am free," he answered, "but I'm afraid not for long."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I have already got into mischief again."</p>

<p>The boy jumped up.</p>

<p>"It's a lie, mother. He is trying to shield me. I stole some
money the day he came out, and he wants to make out it was he."</p>

<p>Kathleen's eyes glittered and a tear came into them.</p>

<p>"Ralph! Ralph! don't tell me this is true."</p>

<p>The boy swept to her and flung his arms around her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, save me. What am I to do? They'll catch me. I know
they'll catch me. I've taken a ticket for Paris, but there'll be a
man waiting there. He'll tap me on the shoulder. I've seen it all a
hundred times these last few days."</p>

<p>"Why did you do this, Ralph? Have I not helped you before? I
prayed to you to be less extravagant, but you know I would have
helped you again rather than&mdash;"</p>

<p>She buried her face in her hands and wept.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear God! My husband and then my son, both&mdash;"</p>

<p>Raymond went to her and grasped her shoulders.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, it is only through the eyes of suffering that one
sees things clearly and sees them whole. I have suffered and I have
learnt to see. It is the life of ease that dulls one and breeds
temptation. Give this boy a chance. You have given him everything
else, but they have always been the wrong things. Don't let him go
to Paris, let him go to where there are great open spaces, and life
is a battle to survive. As for this money, what does it matter to
me? I have accustomed myself to prison life. I shall be an old
'lag' in time, one who probably prefers prison life to
freedom."</p>

<p>A queer expression crept over Kathleen's face as she regarded
her husband. She said simply:</p>

<p>"You have changed, Raymond."</p>

<p>They were summng up in each other the toll of those five years.
His hair had turned quite grey, but his figure was firmer and more
erect, his eye clearer, and his skin healthier. She had become more
fragile, her face paler, but she was still a beautiful woman. She
turned suddenly to Ralph and said:</p>

<p>"Whom did you steal this money from?"</p>

<p>"Reggie de Tourneville."</p>

<p>Kathleen started, and her figure appeared to sway.</p>

<p>"Reggie de Tourneville!"</p>

<p>She put her hand to her bosom.</p>

<p>"Wait...wait..." she muttered. "Reggie de Tourneville!
Indeed!"</p>

<p>She seated herself and pondered. At last she said:</p>

<p>"Ralph, do you love your mother?"</p>

<p>"Mother, how can you ask?"</p>

<p>"Kiss me, dear."</p>

<p>Ralph flung his arms around her and kissed her. She sighed
contentedly.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, "you wait here, you two. I know Reggie de
Tourneville. I have an idea I can settle this affair with him."</p>

<p>"No, no, mother, you mustn't demean yourself to that swine. He
will only snub you, be rude to you. He has an awful reputation in
every way. He's rich too, you can't buy him off."</p>

<p>"I can try. Wait for me, I may be some time. Do not move from
this room."</p>

<p>And before they could protest she had gone.</p>

<p>The night was cold, and the wind and rain battered against the
window panes of the little room. Father and son sat, one on the
bed, the other on a chair, listening and waiting. There seemed to
be nothing to say in this fateful interlude, or there was so much
to say that their strained voices would make it seem unreal. The
boat train to Paris went, and the dinner hour came and went. It was
nine o'clock and Ralph said:</p>

<p>"She's a long time, father."</p>

<p>"Yes...yes, she's a long time."</p>

<p>Raymond was indeed restless and nervous, and sometimes he would
jump up and pace the room. Ralph lighted a cigarette and offered
his father one, but the latter would not take it. The room got
colder and colder. At a quarter past ten Ralph said peevishly:</p>

<p>"What's she doing, father? She's an awful long time."</p>

<p>And Raymond replied a little hysterically:</p>

<p>"She's settling up! She's settling up!"</p>

<p>And about every ten minutes Ralph would exclaim:</p>

<p>"I wonder where she is. What is she doing, father? Why doesn't
she hurry up?"</p>

<p>And Raymond had no response to make.</p>

<p>Came eleven o'clock, half past, a quarter to twelve, midnight,
and still the two men sat there feverishly waiting. The ghosts in
this meagre hotel had all retired. At a quarter past twelve Ralph
was repeating his litany:</p>

<p>"What is she doing? Why doesn't she come, father?" when the
latter suddenly exclaimed irritably:</p>

<p>"The parents sacrifice themselves for the children. And then the
children grow up and sacrifice themselves for their children and so
it goes on. The story of life is an epic of suffering and
sacrifice. Birth is the tyrant." Then he lapsed into silence.</p>

<p>At a quarter to one Ralph exclaimed: "Listen."</p>

<p>There were footsteps in the corridor outside. The door opened
and Kathleen stood once more before them. Her face was pale except
for a spot in the centre of the cheeks, as though they had been
slightly rouged. Her eyes sunk in their dark hollows, had an
unnatural glitter. She sat down limply at the foot of the bed. The
boy, his voice sounding reedy and thin, called out:</p>

<p>"Well? Well?"</p>

<p>Speaking quietly and with perfect control, Kathleen said:</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning, Ralph, you will send that box back to Reggie
de Toumeville, with all the bonds and papers. The money I have
settled about. I think your father is right. I think it would be
good for you to go away for a time, to Canada perhaps."</p>

<p>"Canada!"</p>

<p>"I have been thinking about it, coming back in the cab. All
these years that your father has&mdash;has been away, I have
treated you too indulgently. I have perhaps been too indulgent
myself. One's moral fibre slackens."</p>

<p>She gave a little sob, and the son threw his arms around
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I will do anything you tell me."</p>

<p>She stroked his hair and whispered:</p>

<p>"There, there, dear, let us forget all about it, and start
again. Now go. I want to speak to your father alone."</p>

<p>The boy embraced them both, then picked up his hat, and stumbled
from the room.</p>

<p>Raymond waited for his wife to speak, but she sat there looking
down at her hands upon her lap. At last he said:</p>

<p>"Well, Kathleen, what have you to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I'm very, very tired, Raymond."</p>

<p>He went up to her and kissed her lightly on the temple.</p>

<p>"Is that all, my dear?"</p>

<p>"No, can't you feel there's something more?"</p>

<p>He gripped her shoulders firmly.</p>

<p>"Kathleen, is it possible...would you after all&mdash;take me
back?"</p>

<p>She whispered almost inaudibly:</p>

<p>"If you think I'm worthy of you."</p>

<p>The ex-convict laughed bitterly.</p>

<p>"We all have things to regret, Kathleen...Ralph and I and even
you, perhaps. The fiercest joy is to know that one has someone to
suffer for, someone who can make one suffer. During the last few
days I have experienced the appalling loneliness of the crowded
streets. But if you put your ear to the ground you hear the eternal
rumble of pity passing from heart to heart. Only to-day I heard a
woman offering to sacrifice herself for another. Even in prison I
found this. It is the only Jhing that makes life worth while."</p>

<p>"Oh, Raymond, I was terrified of you returning from prison. I
thought you would look criminal and bitter, but somehow you look
finer. Come, give me your strong arms. I am so weary."</p>

<p>He crushed her to him and murmured:</p>

<p>"I will come for you to-morrow, dear."</p>

<p>For several minutes they clung to each other. Then he led her to
the door, and opened it.</p>

<p>"The corridor is dark," she whispered.</p>

<p>He took her hand and whispered back:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is dark, but there is a light at the end. And if we
hold each other's hands tightly we will find a way."</p>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. THE KIDNAPPED "GENERAL"</h2>

<p>Jim Parker and I climbed a stile, walked a hundred yards along a
sandy road, and came out on to a glorious common. The common was
dotted with clumps of furze, gorse bushes, and beeches. Here and
there a sandy pit broke the normal level of the landscape.</p>

<p>The origin of these weekly rambles of ours had been a mutual
antipathy to golf. Paying the usual physical penalties of men who
lead sedentary lives, we had each been advised by different doctors
"to take up golf." Now golf may be an excellent game&mdash;</p>

<p>I'm not going to argue about it. We did experiment, and lost an
enormous number of balls in an incredibly short space of time, but
the insistent admonition: "Ah, old man, what you ought to do is to
play golf," got on our nerves. We met in solemn conclave, and vowed
that we would not be bullied into playing golf. Eventually we
decided to absorb the benefits of golf without undergoing the
nervous strain of chasing that absurd little white ball.</p>

<p>We rambled far afield. On this occasion we were just over the
border in Buckinghamshire. Jim Parker sighed.</p>

<p>"I wonder they haven't turned this into one of their beastly
golf courses," he said.</p>

<p>"Touch wood," I answered. "We're not across it yet." But no,
there was no golf course on this nameless common. It was a
delightful and deserted spot. We walked across it for half a mile,
when we came to a kind of dingle formed by the opening into a long,
narrow sand-pit. We were just passing it when Jim remarked:</p>

<p>"There's a queer habitation for you!"</p>

<p>I looked in the direction his stick was pointing, and beheld
lialf-way up the dingle an odd-looking shanty in red and white.</p>

<p>"Um," I answered. "Let's go and have a look at it."</p>

<p>We entered the dingle and approached the rustic dwelling. At
first it appeared to be a double-storeyed cabin painted rather
gaily, with pots of flowers hanging from a balcony. On closer
inspection the truth became apparent. On the lower part of the
dwelling, dim but quite perceptible, was the word "General." It was
an old converted "General" motor-bus! The owner had certainly been
rather clever about it. The wheels had either been removed or were
buried in the sand. The lower part remained practically intact,
except for a surrounding wooden platform. The upper part had been
roofed in with timber, and a balcony built out, supported by wooden
posts. The woodwork was painted white; there were chintz curtains
at the windows, and flowers in profusion in pots and tubs. A gay
little dwelling. It was, I suppose, deplorably bad manners for Jim
Parker and me to stand there and laugh. But there was something
about the association of the "General" with this obscure and
picturesque retreat that was irresistible. We were still laughing
when a man came out on to the lower platform and regarded us. He
was a tall, strongly-built man, with a neat, pointed brown beard,
close-cropped hair turning grey, cold blue eyes, and the skin of a
man who lives in the open. He bowed to us gravely, and said:</p>

<p>"Good morning, gentlemen."</p>

<p>We pulled ourselves together and responded. Then he added:</p>

<p>"I presume they have sent you from the inn to hear the story of
the kidnapped General?"</p>

<p>It was the time of day when it was pleasant to hear that there
was an inn in the offing, but we explained that we had come from
the opposite direction, and that we were merely explorers, trying
to escape from the tyranny of social custom. We had no intention of
invading his privacy, but nevertheless the story of the kidnapped
Generabpromised an entertaining diversion.</p>

<p>"Come and sit on this bench in the shade," said the sturdy
individual. "I regret I have no liquid refreshment to offer you,
other than water. My medical advisers&mdash;" He waved his hand in
the direction of the dwelling as though the position explained
itself. We all sat down and lighted our pipes.</p>

<p>"My name is McGregor," he said quite simply&mdash;"William
McGregor, but the story of the kidnapped General circles round the
character of one Ronny Skinner&mdash;Captain Ronald Skinner of the
Royal Engineers. Skinner his name was, but the boys called him
Grinner. He was that&mdash;essentially. He was a man who grinned
through life. He grinned through triumph and through disaster. He
grinned through battle and when things went wrong. He grinned even
when he was bullied or betrayed. He was an irrepressible grinner. A
stocky, merry, jolly chunk of a man who never had any luck, except
that he always managed to escape with his life. His war record
would probably bore you, it was like so many others. He was up to
his neck in it the first week, temporarily attached to the R.F.A.
as a motor-bike despatch rider. He was a wonderful chauffeur, and
could drive any car. You may remember at that time they sent the
despatch riders out in couples, one without lights carrying the
despatches, the other lighted up as a decoy. Ronny was always the
decoy. The war had only been on for five weeks when one night a
shell blew his front wheel to pieces. He was captured by the
Germans. He spent nine months in a concentration camp at Cassel. I
believe he even grinned there. And then one day he and another man
escaped, and got across the border into Switzerland. He reported
and went back into the line. Does this bore you?"</p>

<p>"Not at all&mdash;most interesting," Jim Parker and I both
interjected.</p>

<p>"He was over a year in Belgium, and he grinned when they removed
a piece of shrapnel from the fleshy part of his thigh. 'Dashed
lucky it didn't hit the bone,' he said. He grinned when they sent
him to Salonika, and kept him hanging about for nine months in a
fever-stricken marsh, playing football and cracking lice in his
shirt. He even grinned in Gallipoli when the flood came and carried
all his kit away, and he was eaten up by savage flying things and
poisonous growing things. He didn't grin much when he really got
the fever because he was unconscious most of the time. But he
grinned when he found himself in a clean bed at Imbros. 'Golly!
this is fine!' he said, and he hurried up to get well. He wrote to
his girl in England. Did I tell you there was a girl? She was a
pretty girl, the daughter of a wealthy provision merchant living
quite near here. They were not officially engaged. He had very
little money, and he had only just started his career when the war
came. The father would not sanction it, and there was no mother. I
can't tell you what he wrote to her, or what she wrote to him. But
when her letters came he used to grin contentedly, so one assumes
the girl was staunch. They sent him off to Egypt after that for
another sixteen months and then back to Blighty. Jemini! didn't he
grin when he saw the old white cliffs again! But that wasn't for
long, mind you. In another month he was in France again.</p>

<p>"The fellow went through everything, right up to the retreat in
March, 1918, and then the turn of the tide in July. Except for that
one wound in his thigh he was never touched. When the end came he
was in the army of occupation on the Rhine, grinning at the Boche
housewives, and helping them hang out their clothes to air. And
then they demobbed him and sent him back to England. In the
meantime his father, who was an architectural sculptor, was ruined
by the war. The old man had gone bankrupt, and was living with a
married sister, not much better off than himself. There was no one
to help the boy.</p>

<p>"When the war started Ronny was nineteen. He was now nearly
twenty-five, and he had had no training. He could do nothing except
drive a car. London was flooded with unemployed ex-service men who
could drive cars. He had to get a job anyway, and he went about
grinning into all kinds of offices and warehouses. Nobody wanted
him. The war was over, and the great need now was economy and
retrenchment. The girl was still writing to him, and so he went on
grinning and hoping. But the girl's father forbade him to enter the
house. He had made a lot of money during the war, and he wasn't
going to have his daughter thrown away on a penniless, out-of-work
loafer. His God, no, he wasn't.</p>

<p>"I don't know how Skinner eventually managed to get the job he
did. Things must have been getting pretty desperate, but one day he
blossomed out into a beautiful blue uniform with white piping and
large black buttons. He was a driver on a London General motor-bus.
And there he was sitting up in his box, grinning for all he was
worth, responding to the clang of the bell, swerving through the
traffic in a most skilful way. The company recognized that he was a
good driver, and he was very popular in the yard among the other
men. One day he received quite a promotion. There was a special
motor-bus that used to leave South Hampstead at five minutes to
nine in the morning and run express to the City&mdash;no stop. They
charged a shilling per skull for the trip, and it was very popular
amongst stockbrokers and City merchants. The 'bus was always full,
and the men were allowed to smoke inside. There was an express
return journey in the evening at five-thirty. To Ronny Skinner fell
the great honour of driving this 'bus. The conductor was a man
named Eyles, and they were great pals."</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor paused and looked at us, as though anxious to check
the impression of his story on our faces. The impression apparently
satisfied him, for he proceeded.</p>

<p>"I am now coming to the amazing crisis of this affair, which,
although not kept secret, was never satisfactorily treated, or
truthfully chronicled in the Press. It is not altogether
surprising. Accounts varied, and when reported they usually
appeared so incredible that cautious subeditors were afraid of
their papers'being ridiculed. I was one of the few people who knew
the truth, and even I never knew the whole truth. I have already
told you that there was a woman in the case.</p>

<p>"Ronny Skinner drove that 'bus every day for just on four
months. Every day there was almost identically the same crowd of
men. They rushed up a few minutes before it started, with their
newspapers and despatch-cases and pipes. They scrambled for the
best seats, talked to each other or read their newspapers all the
way down. They paid their shillings to the conductor but no one
took the slightest notice of the driver. I don't think any of them
would have recognized him. The 'bus always started to the minute
and arrived to the minute. There was never a hitch or an accident
of any sort. And yet one day during the first week of July Skinner
received a week's notice. No reason was given. The notice merely
stated that his services would not be required after the following
Friday. The truth was that one of the directors of the company had
written to the manager to say that a job had got to be found for a
chauffeur who was in his employ, and whom he wanted to get rid of.
This story got round. When Ronny heard it, he grinned and said:
'Oh, well, I'll have to look out for something else. That's all!'
He'd been through the war, you see...Now, one thing which affects
this story is a letter he received a few days later. It will be
better if I don't tell you about this till later on. All that week
Ronny grinned, and grinned, and grinned. There never was such a
grin. And one night after the last trip he took Eyles out, and they
went down town and did themselves well. The morning of his last day
was a glorious summer's day, just like this, gentlemen. The 'bus
was there outside Finchley Road Station twenty minutes before its
time, with Skinner and Eyles already aboard. The stockbrokers and
City merchants began to assemble. It was a very full load, and not
only was it full inside and out, but there were five standing
up.</p>

<p>"Five minutes to nine&mdash;clang went the bell! Grrh! Grrh!
went the starter. She was off. The stockbrokers started their usual
early morning badinage, papers rustled, cigar smoke curled upwards.
Everything was delightfully as usual. The 'bus went along at its
usual pace past Swiss Cottage. A little farther on it took a
turning to the right down-hill.</p>

<p>"How provoking!" said the manager of a chain of tea-shops. "I
suppose the road is up.' Several of the others looked equally
provoked, but no one was unduly alarmed. At the end of a few
minutes, however, a curious sense of misgiving crept over the
company. The 'bus had taken another turning to the right and <i>was
going back in the direction from which it had come!</i></p>

<p>"Exclamations were flying around. 'What's the matter?' 'Why is
he doing this?' 'Here, ring the bell.' Eyles was appealed to, but
he only looked bewildered. He rang the bell. No notice was taken of
it. Some of them tapped on the glass, but all they could see was
Skinner's face, grinning furiously.</p>

<p>"In five minutes' time they were nearly a mile out of their
course, and making for somewhere west of Golder's Green. The
stockbrokers and City merchants began to get seriously alarmed. It
was not only that the bus was out of its course, but it was being
driven recklessly. It hardly slackened pace to go round corners.
When impeded it dashed along on the wrong side of the road; it
lurched through the traffic regardless of consequences. At one
corner a policeman held up his hand to stop it, but the bus swerved
past him, and at the last second he succumbed to the popular slogan
of 'Safety First' and leapt out of the way. After that the 'bus
went off the beaten track. It raced along side-streets, and was
already getting out into the country. Now, I want you to get firmly
fixed in your mind's eye the picture of that company of gentlemen
being whirled away from their lawful occasions. I could give you
the details of several specific cases. There was for instance, the
chief cashier of a banking establishment in Lombard Street. He had
the keys of the strong-room on him. It meant that the bank could do
no business until he turned up. There was a barrister who had to
defend a fraudulent company promoter at the Old Bailey at eleven
o'clock. There was another man with six hundred and fifty pounds in
cash in a bag. He had to pay off a ship's company down at Tilbury
Docks at ten-thirty. The manager of the chain of tea-shops had to
meet his directors at Cannon Street Hotel at ten, and render his
annual report. There were innumerable board meeting appointments,
business appointments, urgent affairs to be settled that morning,
stocks to be disposed of, shares bought, certainties to be acted
on, not even bookmakers to be overlooked, and here they all were
rushing out into the country captive to the bow and spear (or shall
we say wheel and lever?) of a madman!</p>

<p>"Englishmen as a rule have the reputation of taking this kind of
adventure philosophically, but there was an element of outrage
about this performance which infuriated them. Liberty of the
subject indeed! It was the sudden realization of their utter
helplessness which led to a condition of pandemonium. All they
could do was to ring the bell furiously all the time, bang on the
window, and yell out. 'Stop! Stop!' The men on top were no better
off. They tried to get at the driver, but he is protected by a
solid canopy. They could not even see him. They began to yell out
to the passers-by, but the noise was so uproarious and confused,
the passers-by merely thought it was some picnic or excursion party
cheering, and they cheered back in response and waved their hats.
The mad thing got right away into the country. Eyles was being
bullied and badgered, but he merely continued to look bewildered
and to mutter, 'I don't know what's the matter with the chap. I
can't stop him.' Some of the passengers crowded the back-board with
the idea of leaping off if the 'bus slackened its pace at all, but
it never went slow enough for that. There was nothing to do but
bawl, and yell, and argue. Jagged nerves led to internal
dissensions. One man wanted to smash the window and knock the
driver over the head, and when it was pointed out to him that such
an action would almost inevitably lead to a wreck of the 'bus, or
in any case to a very bad accident, he wanted to fight his
opponents, and was only prevented from carrying out his project by
being held down on the floor.</p>

<p>"The 'bus was scheduled to carry twenty-two passengers inside
and twenty-four out. In addition to this were the five straphangers
inside, making a total of fifty-one, of whom only three were women,
one being the secretary to the editor of a financial paper, another
a clerk in the Admiralty, and the third a lady with a summons to
serve on a jury The three women were neither better nor worse than
the forty-eight men. The behaviour of the whole crowd of them can
only be described as deplorable.</p>

<p>"I do not propose to weary you gentlemen with a detailed
chronicle of the journey. Once well out into the country the grin
of Skinner became broader, the venomous expression of the
passengers more menacing. All their business and other appointments
had gone by the wind They were collectively buoyed up by the
anticipation of some sort of feral vengeance. They gave up hope of
any immediate release and simply waited for the mad journey to end,
as end it must. They rushed along the country roads, up and down
hills, across commons, through little villages, scattering all
before them. They ran over three fowls, a cat, and two geese. In
one village the left mudguard struck the wheel of a milk-cart and
hurled seventeen gallons of good milk into the roadway. These were
the only tragedies of note. In other respects it was a perfectly
successful and triumphant ride, reflecting the utmost credit on the
man at the wheel. Nothing happened, I say, until they
reached&mdash;this common. Coming round the bend where you
gentlemen came, the car began gradually to slow up. When it reached
the entrance to this dingle it was travelling at rather less than
six miles an hour. Suddenly it turned, swerved to the left, raced
up the dingle, and ran nose on into the sand with a pretty
considerable bump. And there it stuck, and there it remains to this
day."</p>

<p>Parker and I uttered an exclamation of astonishment, and Mr.
McGregor paused and critically examined the stem of his pipe.</p>

<p>"And then?" I asked, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Hats fell off, some of the men were jerked on to the floor, but
no one was seriously hurt. When they realized that the tension was
over, they scrambled off that 'bus like madmen. In a body they
rushed round and bore down on the chauffeur. Then an unpleasant
surprise awaited them. Skinner had already dismounted. He was
standing clear of the car, with an insolent grin on his face. In
either hand he held a six-chambered revolver. As the crowd
approached, he called out: 'Stand back!'</p>

<p>"Now, a panic-stricken crowd is liable to do all kinds of
unreasonable things, but there is something about the glitter of a
shiny little revolver that will steady the most rampageous. The
stockbrokers and City merchants, armed with walking-sticks,
newspapers, and despatch-cases drew back and wavered. A
white-whiskered City accountant with heavy gold chains hanging over
his pendulous stomach bawled out: 'What the devil is the meaning of
this outrage?' Skinner called out: 'Corporal Eyles, get all these
men and women into line!' There was then another disconcerting
discovery. Eyles appeared from the rear of the 'bus also carrying a
six-chamber. He drew himself up and saluted Skinner. Skinner
acknowledged the salute, and then, turning to the crowd, he said,
'There are fifty-one of you to two of us. With a little cohesion it
would be possible for you to overcome us, but I assure you before
that happened eighteen of you gentlemen would surely die. My
friend, Corporal Eyles, who was with me during the first battle of
the Marne, will now get you into line. I will then address you from
the top of the 'bus.' A more remarkable sight has surely never been
seen on an English common. One of the women became hysterical and
ran away, and she was allowed to go. The rest, under cover of
Eyles' revolver, were drawn up in two lines of twenty-five. There
they all stood, the oddest collection of sizes, and ages, and
figures, in top-hats, and bowler hats, and Trilby hats, with
newspapers tucked under their arms, holding bags and
despatch-cases, and sticks and umbrellas. And the birds were
singing overhead, just as they are to-day, gentlemen, and the bees
were humming above the gorse. And there was Skinner, still in his
driver's uniform, standing commandingly on the top of that
ridiculous red 'bus. There was a clamour of angry protest from
those fifty throats, not unmixed with jeering and even a little
laughter. It became necessary for Skinner to flash one of the
horrid little revolvers to obtain complete silence. When this
desirable condition had been obtained, he spoke in a loud, ringing
voice:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, let me relieve your minds at once of what
I know is the dominant fear that possesses you. Eyles and I have
not brought you here to rob you. You shall return with all your
property intact. Our exploit is rather a spiritual than a material
one. We are doing it for your good. If we had not kidnapped you in
this way you would now all be grinding and grubbing away in the
City, making money, losing it; planning to make it, planning to
lose it; contributing nothing of any real importance to the human
commonweal. And now here you are on a lovely common with all the
day before you, and the sun above your heads. You do not see enough
of Nature, you do not learn to live, you do not see facts as they
are. You never give yourselves a chance. Your idea of visiting
Nature is to motor down to some such place as this, and then create
for yourselves a miniature arena of all the petty, fidgeting
conditions of your City lives. You stoop over a little white ball.
Isn't that the expression you use: 'Keep your eye on the ball?' I
ask you, gentlemen, don't keep your eye on the ball, but keep your
eye on the stars above you. Soften your hearts, and, when you
travel, think of the people who drive you; when you labour and
profit and play, think of the people who minister to your
necessities. I have mentioned that there are fifty of you to two of
us. Well, that represents roughly the percentage of the
non-combatant element in the Great War. Have you already forgotten
that there was a great war, gentlemen? Have you already forgotten
Eyles and me? or will you forget us to-morrow? Go, then, all of
you, wander the fields and commons, and look into your hearts. Go,
and be damned to you! And without the slightest hesitation, he
turned his revolver on to the crowd and fired point-blank into
it!</p>

<p>"The panic that ensued is indescribable. The old man with the
white whiskers leapt sideways, jumped, and fell into a gorse bush,
shot through the heart. No, that is not true, but that was the
immediate impression. As a matter of fact he did fall into a gorse
bush, but that was only because he caught his foot in a rut. With a
wild yell the whole company fled helter-skelter out of the dingle
and across the common, followed by shot after shot from three
revolvers. None of them was to know that the three revolvers were
only loaded with blank cartridges. Was there ever such a sight?
Top-hats fell off and were not reclaimed, bags and sticks and
newspapers were scattered hither and thither. Someone with
experience yelled out: 'Scatter! Open out!' They <i>did</i>
scatter, they <i>did</i> open out. Younger men were racing like the
wind. Fat old gentlemen were tumbling into sand-pits. The two women
were screaming and holding on to the men. The common was dotted
with black figures, ducking, doubling, and yelling. No one turned
to look back at the assailants. No one saw the broad grin on
Skinner's face."</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor again paused, and then he remarked casually:</p>

<p>"We've shifted the position of the old 'bus a little since those
days, and removed the wheels."</p>

<p>"We?" said Parker faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. McGregor seemed hesitating how to shape the crisis of his
story.</p>

<p>"I have mentioned the letter," he continued. "I cannot tell you
the exact contents of the letter. You see, it was one of those
sacred missives&mdash;a love-letter, and not written to me. But
this I know. It came from the girl&mdash;this girl of Skinner's.
Her father had died suddenly, and forgotten to make a will. The
daughter inherited his fortune. I think there was something in it
about a special licence, something about Paris, something about the
Italian Lakes. It may seem ironic that a man of Skinner's character
should accept money left by a war profiteer. On the other hand, it
seemed not altogether unfair that this money should go back to a
man who went through it all. I think the girl must have pointed it
out to him in the letter. He grinned so happily."</p>

<p>"But what happened when the stockbrokers scattered?" I
asked.</p>

<p>"Everything was so easy after that. A parcel of
clothes&mdash;two suits&mdash;was produced from beneath the front
seat of the bus. The two men went behind some bushes in the dingle
and changed. You see, the reason why Skinner had come to this
particular common was because the girl lived at that little
Georgian house just beyond the pine trees over there. You can't see
it from here, but it is less than ten minutes' walk away. Thither
they both went."</p>

<p>"But we are still mystified, Mr. McGregor," said Parker,
noticing that our informant seemed inclined to leave off. "How is
it that the 'bus is still here? Why are <i>you</i> living here?
What action did the passengers take? and the company? Did Skinner
get away?"</p>

<p>McGregor sighed pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Ronny Skinner is not the kind of man to go back on a pal. It
may simplify things to you, gentlemen, if I tell you that my name
is not McGregor&mdash;it is Eyles! Skinner did not have the
slightest difficulty in getting away. No one recognized in the
handsome young man who arrived at Cathay House any resemblance to
the driver of the General. They had not even got his photograph,
you see, to put in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. No one had noticed him
very much. That is the advantage of being a nonentity. There was a
halfhearted law case between the passengers and the company, but,
as I have said, the majority were only too anxious to escape the
ridicule which the case brought upon them. As for the 'bus itself,
lawyers argued about it for nearly a year. It was so damaged that
the company was not overanxious to have it back. The local Commons
Committee tried to make them. In the end it was found that Cathay
House estate&mdash;that is to say, the girl&mdash;had certain
rights over this particular dingle. The argument went on so long
that the whole thing petered out. About a year later Skinner said
to me: 'Eyles, old boy, here is a hundred pounds. You go and make
that 'bus into a snug little retreat, and live there when you want
a change.' And Skinner allows me two hundred a year to live on, for
helping him in the exploit. And here I am!"</p>

<p>"You seem a very educated man for a corporal and a 'bus
conductor," I remarked.</p>

<p>"My experience was almost identical to that of Skinner," said
Eyles. "When the war broke out I was just leaving Charterhouse. I
joined up as a private. When it was over I was twenty-four, with no
training, and my people had all been ruined. There are lots of
others, too, in our position."</p>

<p>Parker stood up and shook himself.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Eyles," he said, "I'm sure we are much obliged to
you. It's a most amazing story, and it's delightful to know that it
has a happy ending."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Eyles. "It has a happy ending. I hope I haven't
bored you. You'll find the inn a quarter of a mile past the cross
roads."</p>

<p>We thanked him profusely and departed. The kidnapped General I
It was a most amazing story. As we tramped along the road we
discussed and dissected the details of it.</p>

<p>"There's one thing that strikes me as queer," said Parker. "He
said he was leaving Charterhouse when the war broke out. Say he was
eighteen. When the war was over he would be approximately
twenty-three, so now he should be about twenty-seven. He looks much
older."</p>

<p>"Yes," I answered, "he does, but that may be partly due to the
fact of his hair going grey. A lot of men went prematurely grey
during the war. He looks very wiry and fit."</p>

<p>"Do you believe it's possible that there wasn't a lot of talk
about it in the newspapers?"</p>

<p>"There may have been some. But you know what it is&mdash;one
often reads some fantastic story of that sort, and one simply does
not believe it. It's like freak dinners and explorers' yams. One
thinks, 'Yes, yes,' and then you turn to see who won the
semi-finals at Wimbledon. It may be true. And then there is a lot
in what he says about ridicule. The majority of people would rather
be robbed than made to look ridiculous."</p>

<p><br>
<br>
A little farther on we came to the inn. It was a pleasant
lime-washed building set back from the road, and called "The
Harvester." A few carters and field labourers were drinking beer in
the public bar. We entered and called for bread and cheese and
beer. The landlord, a fat, melancholy-looking man in corduroy
trousers and a slate-grey flannel shirt, insisted on our having our
repast in a little room called a "coffee-room." He seemed friendly
but not inclined to be very discursive. This may have been due to
the fact that his pulmonary organs were obviously in need of
repair. He wheezed, and gasped, and panted as he toddled hither and
thither in the prosecution of his good offices. It was late and we
were hungry, and is there anything in such circumstances so
completely satisfying as bread and cheese and good brown ale? We
munched in happy silence, both, I believe, still ruminating on the
bearded man's strange story.</p>

<p>When we had finished, we called the landlord to settle our
reckoning.</p>

<p>Having done so, and come to complete agreement with him that it
was a fine day, one of us&mdash;I think it was Parker, said:</p>

<p>"That's a queer customer you have out there, living in the
motor-'bus on the common."</p>

<p>The landlord blinked his eyes, wheezed through the contortions
of his breathing apparatus:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ormeroyd?"</p>

<p>"No," one of us answered. "Mr. Eyles, the man in the shanty
built on the remains of an old General motor-'bus."</p>

<p>The landlord's face twisted into a form that was probably the
nearest thing it ever did in the way of a smile. When in control of
his voice more more, he said:</p>

<p>"Eyles? Oh, so that's what he calls himself to-day, is it?"</p>

<p>At this surprising remark we both looked at each other
questioningly. Before we had had time to frame any query, however,
the landlord added:</p>

<p>"What story did he tell you about the 'bus to-day?"</p>

<p>As briefly as possible Parker recounted the story as told to us.
When it was finished, we listened patiently to the landlord's
lungs. At the end of a few minutes the bellows appeared to give
out.</p>

<p>"Oh, so that's the story to-day, is it? A good one, too. He
always tells a different story."</p>

<p>"What!" I exclaimed. "You mean to say the whole thing is made
up?"</p>

<p>"I wouldn't go so far as that," said the landlord. "There is a
story right enough, but it has never been told. I've heard tell
that if the true story was ever told&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped and blinked at a small canary in a diminutive cage in
front of the window.</p>

<p>We waited for the landlord's version, but it seemed never to be
coming.</p>

<p>"Did you say that his real name is Ormeroyd?" I asked at
length.</p>

<p>"So I've heard tell," answered our host. "They say he is a very
clever fellow. He's a very nice fellow, anyway. I've nothing
against him. They say he used to be a writer before the war. You
know, story-book stuff, tales and so on&mdash;made quite a big
name, I believe, and lots of money. Now all the stories he invents
concern the old 'bus."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;why? What is the cause?"</p>

<p>"I believe there is a story that, if told, would leave the story
you heard to-day not worth mentioning. D'you remember during the
first weeks of the war they sent a whole lot of London motor-'buses
out to help transport the troops? Well, Mr. Ormeroyd was a skilful
shuvver, and he volunteered, and got the billet to drive one of
these 'buses.</p>

<p>"I don't rightly know the details. He was only out there six
weeks. There was some awful incident&mdash;I believe he was the
only one of a company saved&mdash;he on his old battered 'bus.
There was a score of them 'buses, men and drivers, and all blown to
pieces. It was somewhere in Belgium. He got away back to the lines.
But&mdash;well, it's kind of&mdash;what do you call it?&mdash;you
know, got on his nerves, never thinks of anything else. He can
still invent his stories, but they always concern the old 'bus.
When they discharged him, I believe he went to one of these dumps
and bought an old battered 'bus. He says it was his. It may be, for
all we know. People up on the common there gave him permission to
buildjhis shanty. He lives there, thinkin' and writin'. A clever
fellow, they all say."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;hasn't he any friends? Can't they make it better for
him?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's got plenty of friends. The people at the house,
for instance&mdash;you know Cathay House&mdash;they look after him.
There's a girl there. They say it is better for him to live as he
does&mdash;a kind of rest-cure. He's getting better. They say he'll
get all right in time. He's got money and his health is otherwise
middlin' good. He's a clever fellow. He'll get it all back, they
say. His stories get better, you know. I've noticed it. That one
about the stockbrokers! Oh, dear! He, he, he!"</p>

<p>"There is a girl, you say?" Parker almost whispered.</p>

<p>"A very nice girl, too, the daughter of Colonel Redding, who
owns Cathay House. Why, yes. Oh, I do like that about the
stockbrokers!"</p>

<p>The landlord was still chuckling as we took our departure.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
When we were once more upon the road, I remarked:</p>

<p>"So this story, also, may have a happy ending, Jim."</p>

<p>"I hope so," answered Parker. "I liked that fellow. I liked the
rude things he said about golf."</p>

<p>And borrowing a match from me, he lighted his pipe; and we
continued our pilgrimage.</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. THE FRIENDS</h2>

<p>White and Mapleson often tried to recall the occasion when their
friendship began, but neither succeeded. Perhaps it had its origin
in some moment when the memory was to some extent blurred. Certain
it is that they drifted together across the miasma of commercial
London, and founded a deep and lasting friendship that found its
chief expression in the chinking of glasses in the saloon and
luncheon bars of various hostelries off Oxford Street and
Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>White acted as an agent for a firm of wire-mattress
manufacturers in Old Street in the City, and as his business was
conducted principally among the furnishing and upholstering
outfitters in the West End, and as Mapleson was the manager of the
brass-bed department at Taunton's, the large furnishing emporium in
Bloomsbury, it is not surprising that they came in contact, and
that they had many interests in common. There is, alas! no doubt
that the most absorbing interest of both was the consumption of
liquid refreshment, and there is also, alas! no doubt that the
friendship was quickened by the curious coincidence of their mental
vision when stimulated by alcoholic fumes. And it is here that one
or two curious facts relating to the personalities of the two men
should be noted. During the day it would be no uncommon thing for
either man to consume anything between ten and fifteen whiskies and
sodas, and sometimes even more; yet of neither man could it be said
that he was ever really drunk. On the other hand, of neither man
could it be said that he was ever really sober. White was a man of
medium height, rather pale and slight.</p>

<p>He had a dark moustache, and was always neatly dressed in a dark
blue suit, with well-fitting boots and gloves. He was extremely
quiet and courteous in manner, and his manner varied but little.
The effect of alcohol upon him was only to accentuate his courtesy
and politeness. Toward the evening his lips would tremble a little,
but he would become more and more ingratiating. His voice would
descend to a refined gentle croon, his eyes would just glow with a
sympathetic light, and he would listen with his head slightly on
one side and an expression that conveyed the idea that the remarks
of the speaker were a matter of great moment to him. Not that he
did not speak himself; on the contrary, he spoke well, but always
with a deferential timbre, as though attuning himself to the mood
and mental attitude of his companion.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Mapleson always started the day badly. He was
a large, florid man, with a puffy face and strangely colourless
eyes. He wore a ponderous frock-coat that was just a little out of
date, with a waistcoat that hung in folds, and the folds never
seemed free from sandwich crumbs and tobacco-ash. He had an
unfortunate habit with his clothes of never being quite complete.
That is to say, that if he had on a new top-hat, his boots were
invariably shabby; or if his boots were a recent acquisition, his
top-hat would seem all brushed the wrong way. As I say, he always
started the day badly. He would be very late and peevish, and would
fuss about with pills and cloves. He would complain of not being
quite "thumbs up." Eleven-fifteen would invariably find him round
at the Monitor, leaning against the mahogany bar and asking Mrs.
Wylde to mix him "a whisky and peppermint," or some other decoction
that between them they considered would be just the thing for his
special complaint that morning. "In the way of business" he would
treat and be treated by several other pals in "the sticks," as this
confraternity called the furnishing trade, It would be interesting
to know what proportion of Mapleson's and White's income was
devoted to this good cause. When Mapleson would arrive home
sometimes late at night, breathing heavily, and carrying with him
the penetrating atmosphere of the tap-room, he would say in
response to the complaints of his tired wife:</p>

<p>"I hate the stuff, my dear. You have to do it, though. It's all
in the way of business."</p>

<p>A sociologist might have discovered, if he were searching for
concrete instances, that White and Mapleson spent on each other
every year very nearly eighty pounds, although the business they
did together amounted to rather less than thirty, a somewhat
unsound premium.</p>

<p>As the day wore on, Mapleson would improve. And it was one of
the assets of the White-Mapleson friendship that they usually did
not meet till luncheon-time. Then the two friends would chink
glasses and stroll arm in arm into Polati's, in Oxford Street, for,
as Mapleson would say, "When a man works hard he needs feeding,"
and White would agree with him deferentially, and they would secure
a seat not too near the band, and after thoroughly considering the
menu, they would order a "mixed grill," as being "something English
and that you can get your teeth into." During the interval of
waiting for the mixed grill, which took fifteen minutes to prepare,
Mapleson would insist on standing White a gin-and-bitters, and of
course it was only right and courteous of White to return the
compliment. The mixed grill would be washed down with a tankard of
ale or more often with whisky and soda, after which the friends
would sometimes share a Welsh rabbit or a savoury, and it was
Mapleson who introduced the plan of finishing the meal with a
coffee and liqueur. "It stimulates one's mind for the afternoon's
business," he would explain, and White flattered him on his good
sense, and insisted on standing an extra liqueur, "just to give
value to one's cigar." Under the influence of these good things,
Mapleson would become garrulous, and White even more soothing and
sympathetic. This luncheon interval invariably lasted two hours or
two hours and a half. They would then part, each to his own
business, while making an appointment to meet later in the
afternoon at the Duke of Gadsburg.</p>

<p>And here a notable fact must be recorded: for an hour or two in
the afternoon each man <i>did</i> do some work. And it is a
remarkable point that Taunton's, the great house in Bloomsbury,
always considered Mapleson a good salesman, as indeed he was. The
vast lapses of time that he spent away from business were explained
away on the score of active canvassing. His "turnover" for the year
compared favourably with that of the other managers at Taunton's.
While of White strange rumours of the enormous fortune that he was
accumulating were always current. The natural reserve of the
wire-mattress agent, and his remarkable lucidity on matters of
finance, added to the fact that he took in and studied <i>The
Statist</i>, gave him a unique position in the upholstering world.
Men would whisper together over their glasses and say, "Ah, old
White! He knows a thing or two," and grave speculations would go on
as to whether his income ran into four figures, and in what
speculations he invested his money. Considerable profundity was
given to these rumours by the fact that White always <i>had</i>
money and that he was always willing to lend it. He carried a
sovereign purse that seemed inexhaustible.</p>

<p>Mapleson, on the other hand, though natively lavish, had periods
of "financial depression." At these periods he would drink more and
become maudlin and mawkish, and it was invariably White who helped
him out of his troubles. The two friends would meet later in the
afternoon "to take a cup of tea," and it often happened that
Mapleson felt that tea would not be just the thing for his nervous
constitution; so White would prescribe a whisky and soda, and they
would adjourn to a place where such things may be procured. It is
remarkable how quickly the time passed under these conditions; but
just before six Mapleson would "run back to the shop to see if any
orders had come in." With studious consideration White would wait
for him. It was generally half-past six or seven before Mapleson
returned, thoroughly exhausted with his day's work.</p>

<p>It was then that the suavity and charm of White's manner was
most ingratiating. He would insist on Mapleson having a comfortable
seat by the fire in the saloon, and himself carrying across the
drinks from the bar. Mapleson soon became comforted, and would
suggest "a game of pills before going home." Nothing appealed to
White more than this, for he was a remarkable billiard-player.
Young Charlie Maybird, who is a furniture draftsman and an expert
on sport, used to say that "White could give any pub marker in
London forty in a hundred and beat him off the mark." He had a
curious feline way of following the balls round the table; he
seemed almost to purr over them, to nurse them and stroke them, and
make them perform most astounding twists and turns. And every time
he succeeded, he would give a sort of self-depreciatory croon, as
much as to say: "I'm so sorry! I really don't know how the balls
happen to do all this." And yet it is remarkable how often White
lost, especially against Mapleson.</p>

<p>Mapleson was one of those players who give one the impression of
being an expert on an off-day. As a matter of fact, he never had an
"on" day. He was just a third-rate player; only he would attempt
most difficult shots, and then give vent to expressions of the
utmost surprise and disgust that they didn't come off.</p>

<p>The billiards would last till eight o'clock or half-past, when a
feeling of physical exhaustion would prompt the arrangement that "a
chop would be a good idea." They would then adjourn once more to
the dining-room at the Monitor, and regale themselves with chops,
cheese, and ale, by which time Mapleson would arrive at the
conclusion that it wasn't worth while going home; so an adjournment
would be made once more to the bar, and the business of the evening
would begin.</p>

<p>It might be worth while to recall one or two features of the
Monitor bar, which was invariably crowded by salesmen and
assistants from Taunton's, and was looked upon as a sort of
headquarters of the upholstering trade at that time. It was a large
room, fitted in the usual way with glittering mahogany and small
glass mirrors. Two long seats upholstered in green leather were set
about a cheerful fireplace of blue tiles. There were also four
small circular tables with marble tops, and on each side of the
fireplace two enormous bright-blue pots of hideous design
containing palms. On the side facing the bar was a florid staircase
with a brass hand-rail leading up to the dining and
billiard-rooms.</p>

<p>The only difference that a stranger might have felt between this
and any other place of similar description at that time lay perhaps
in its mental atmosphere. There was always a curious feeling of
freemasonry. In addition to Mrs. Wylde there were two other
barmaids, Nancy and Olive, who was also sometimes called "the
Titmouse." Both were tall, rather thin girls, with a wealth of
wonderful flaxen hair. They seemed to spend a considerable amount
of time, when not engaged in serving, in brewing themselves cocoa
and hot milk. Olive was a teetotaller, and confessed frankly with
regard to alcohol that she "hated the muck," but Nancy would
occasionally drink stout.</p>

<p>To be served by Mrs. Wylde was a treat that only occasionally
occurred to the more favoured devotees of the Monitor. She was a
woman of enormous proportions, with a white-powdered face and also
a wealth of flaxen hair. She invariably wore a rather shabby black
dress, trimmed with lace, and a huge bunch of flowers, usually
lilies and carnations.</p>

<p>Now, everybody who came into the bar or the Monitor seemed not
only to know Nancy and Olive and Mrs. Wylde by name, but everybody
else by their name or nickname. For instance, this sort of thing
would happen: a pale, thin young man, with pointed boots and a sort
of semi-sporting suit, would creep furtively in and go up to the
bar and lean across and shake hands with Nancy, and after a normal
greeting would say:</p>

<p>"Has the Captain been in?" Nancy would reply:</p>

<p>"Yes, he was in with the Rabbit about four o'clock." Then the
young man would say:</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't he leave nothing for me?" and Nancy would say:</p>

<p>"No. I wouldn't be surprised if he came in later. 'Ere, I tell
you what&mdash;" and she would draw the young man to a corner of
the bar, and there would be a whispered conversation for a few
moments, and then the young man would go out. All of which would
seem very mysterious to a casual visitor.</p>

<p>Of this atmosphere White and Mapleson were part and parcel. They
had their own particular little round table near the fire, where,
despite Mapleson's daily avowal to get home, one could rely on
finding them nearly every evening. And they gathered about them a
small colony of kindred spirits. Here they would sit very often
till nearly twelve o'clock, when the Monitor shut, drinking whisky
and talking. As the evening advanced, Mapleson expanded. One of his
favourite themes was conscription. On this subject he and White
were absolutely in accord.</p>

<p>"Every man ought to be made to serve his country," Mapleson
would say, bringing his fist down with a bang on the marble table.
"He ought to be made to realize his civil responsibilities and what
he owes to the empire. Every man under thirty-five should serve
three years."&mdash;Mapleson was forty-four&mdash;"It seems to me
we're becoming a nation of knock-kneed, sentimental women."</p>

<p>And White would dilate upon what the Germans were doing and
would give precise facts and figures of the strength of the German
army, and the cost and probabilities of landing ten army corps on
the coast of Suffolk.</p>

<p>Another favourite theme was the action of "these silly women,"
and Mapleson would set the bar in roars of laughter with a
description of what <i>he</i> would do if <i>he</i> were Home
Secretary.</p>

<p>Mapleson was very fond of talking about "his principles." In
conversation it seemed that his actions must be hedged in by these
iron-bound conventions. In effect they were virtually as follows:
Business comes first always; never fail to keep a business
appointment; never mix port and whisky; never give anything to a
stranger that you might give to a pal.</p>

<p>He had other rules of life, but they were concerned exclusively
with questions of diet and drinking, and need not concern us
here.</p>

<p>Thoroughly exhausted with the day's business, Mapleson would
leave the imperturbable White just before twelve o'clock, and not
infrequently would find it necessary to take a cab to Baker Street
to catch his last train to Willesden Green, where he lived, and
where he would arrive at night, having spent during the day a sum
varying between twenty and thirty shillings, which was precisely
the amount he allowed his wife every week to keep house for a
family of five, and to include food, clothing, and washing.</p>

<p>White lived at Acton, and no one ever quite knew how he arrived
there or by what means. But he never failed to report at nine
o'clock the next morning at Old Street, with all his notes, orders,
and instructions neatly written out. It was remarkable how long the
Monitor remained the headquarters of this fraternity, for, as one
of them remarked, "the licensing business is very sensitive "in the
same way that a flock of crows will simultaneously and without any
apparent reason fly from one hill to another; it will be a sort of
fashion for a group of men to patronise a certain establishment and
then suddenly to segregate elsewhere. It is true that there were
one or two attempts at defection&mdash;Charlie Maybird once made an
effort to establish a headquarters as far away as the Trocadero
even&mdash;but the birds soon returned to the comforting hostelry
of Mrs. Wylde.</p>

<p>And then one summer Mapleson was very ill. He got wet through
walking to Baker Street one evening when, after having started, he
found he had only three coppers on him. He travelled home in his
wet clothes, and next day developed a bad chill, which turned into
pneumonia. For days he lay in a critical state, but, thanks to the
attention of Mrs. Mapleson, who did not go to bed for three nights,
and a careful doctor, he got over the crisis. But the doctor
forbade him to go back to business for a fortnight, and suggested
that if it was possible to arrange it, a few days at the seaside
might set him up. White called several times, and was most anxious
and solicitous, and assured Mrs. Mapleson that he would do anything
in his power to help his friend, and sent a large basket of
expensive fruits and some bottles of very old port wine.</p>

<p>Mapleson's illness, however, was of more troublesome a nature
than appeared at first. After a rather serious relapse the doctor
said that his heart was not quite what it should be, and it was
nearly a month before the question of moving him could be
considered. Taunton's treated Mapleson very well over this, and his
salary was paid every week; only, of course, he lost his
commission, which in the ordinary way represented the bulk of his
income, and it became necessary for Mrs. Mapleson to economize with
the utmost skill, especially as the invalid required plenty of good
and well-cooked food on regaining his strength. The rest of the
family had therefore to go on shorter commons than usual, and
matters were not helped by the fact of one of the children
developing glands and being in an enfeebled condition. White called
one evening, and was drinking a glass of the old port with the
invalid, and they were discussing how it could be arranged for
Mapleson to get a week at Brighton.</p>

<p>"I think I could travel now," said Mapleson; "only I don't see
how the missus is going to leave Flora."</p>

<p>It was then that White had an inspiration. If it would help
matters in the Mapleson family he would be pleased to take a week
off and go to Brighton with Mapleson. Mapleson hailed this idea
with delight, and Mrs. Mapleson was informed, on entering the room
a little later, "You need not bother about it any more, my dear;
White has been good enough to offer to go to Brighton with me."
Mrs. Mapleson was a woman who said very little, and it was
difficult on this occasion to know what she thought. In fact, her
taciturnity at times irritated Mapleson beyond endurance. She
merely paused, drew in her thin pale lips, and murmured, "All
right, dear," and then busied herself with preparing Mapleson's
evening broth.</p>

<p>The friends were very lucky with the weather. Fresh breezes off
the Channel tempered the fierce August sun and made the conditions
on the front delightful. It might be hinted that perhaps the
weather might have been otherwise for all the interest that they
took in it.</p>

<p>For the first day or so, finding his vitality returning to him,
Mapleson persuaded his companion that the choicest spot in Brighton
was the saloon bar of the Old Ship. And he could not show his
gratitude sufficiently. White was given carte blanche to order
anything he liked. But White would not listen to such generosity.
He knew that the expenses that Mapleson had had to endure must be
telling on him, so he insisted on paying at least twice out of
three times. Mapleson acknowledged that it was "a hell of a worry
and responsibility having a family to keep. They simply eat up the
money, my dear chap."</p>

<p>The week passed quickly enough, and both were soon back at their
occupations in town. The friendship pursued the even tenor of its
way, and it was fifteen months before any incident came to disturb
it.</p>

<p>Then one day in October something happened to White. He fell
down in the street, and was taken to a hospital. It was rumoured
that he was dead. Consternation prevailed in the upholstering
confraternity, and Mapleson made anxious enquiries at the hospital
bureau. It was difficult to gather precise details, but it was
announced that White was very ill, and that a very serious
operation would have to be performed. Mapleson returned to the bar
of the Monitor harbouring a nameless dread. A strange feeling of
physical sickness crept over him. He sat in the corner of the bar,
sipping his whisky, enveloped in a lugubrious gloom. He heard the
young sparks enter and laugh and joke about White. It was a subject
of constant and cynical mirth. "Hullo," they would say, "heard
about old White? He's done in at last." And then there would be
whisperings and chucklings, and he would hear: "Drunk himself to
death. Doesn't stand a dog's chance, my dear chap. My uncle had the
same thing. Why, he's been at it now for about twenty-five years.
Can't think how he's lasted so long." And then they would come
grinning up to Mapleson, hoping for more precise details. "Sorry to
hear about your friend, Mr. Mapleson. How did it happen?"</p>

<p>Mapleson could not stand it. He pushed back his half-filled
glass, and stumbled out of the bar. He was not aware of an
affection for White, or of any sentiment other than a vast fear and
a strange absorbing depression. He crept into the saloon of a small
house off the Charing Cross Road, where no one would be likely to
know him, and sat silently sipping from his glass. It seemed to
have no effect upon him. The vision of White lying there, like
death, and perhaps even now the doctors busy with their steel
knives&mdash;Mapleson shivered. He ordered more whisky and drank it
neat. He stumbled on into other bars all the way to Trafalgar
Square, wrestling with his fear, and drinking. The spirits
ultimately took their effect, and he sat somewhere, in some dark
corner, he could never remember where, with his mind in a state of
trance. He remembered being turned out&mdash;it must have been
twelve o'clock&mdash;and engaging a cab&mdash;he could just
remember his address&mdash;and ordering the man to drive home. In
the cab he went sound asleep, hopelessly drunk for the first time
in many years. He knew nothing more till the next day. Some one
must have come down to help carry him in; he was no light weight.
He woke up about one o'clock, feeling very ill and scared. He
jumped up and called out:</p>

<p>"What the devil's the time? What are we all doing? Why haven't I
been called?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Mapleson came in; she put her hand on his forehead and
said:</p>

<p>"It's all right. I sent a telegram to say you were ill. You had
better stop here. I'll get you some tea."</p>

<p>Mapleson fell back on the pillows, and the sickening
recollection of last night came back to him.</p>

<p>Later in the evening Mrs. Mapleson came in again and said:</p>

<p>"I hear that Mr. White has had his operation, and is going on as
well as could be expected."</p>

<p>Beads of perspiration streamed down Mapleson's face, and he
murmured, "My God! my God!" That was all that was said, and the
next day Mapleson went back to work.</p>

<p>The officials at the hospital seemed curiously reticent about
White. The only information to be gleaned for some days was that he
was alive. Mapleson went about his work with nerveless
indifference. He drank, but his drinking was more automatic than
spontaneous. He drank from habit, but he gained neither pleasure
nor profit from doing so.</p>

<p>The nameless fear pursued him. Great bags appeared under his
eyes, which were partly blood-shot. He stooped in his walk, and
began to make mistakes in his accounts, and to be abstracted in
dealing with customers.</p>

<p>He was arraigned before two of the directors of Taunton's, and
one of them finished a harangue by suggesting that "it might be
more conformable to business methods if he would remove the traces
of yesterday's breakfast from the folds of his waistcoat." The
large man received these criticisms in a pathetic silence. "Poor
old Mapleson!" they said round in the bar of the Monitor. "I've
never seen a chap cut up so about anything as he is about White,"
and then abstract discussions on friendship would follow, and
remarkable instances of friendship formed in business.</p>

<p>Of course White would die&mdash;that was a settled and arranged
thing, and curiously enough little sympathy was expressed even by
those to whom White had lent money. Despite his charm of manner and
his generosity, they all felt that there was something about White
they didn't understand. He was too clever, too secretive.</p>

<p>On Friday he was slightly better, but on Saturday he had a
relapse, and on Sunday morning, when Mapleson called at the
hospital, he was informed that White was sinking, and they didn't
expect him to last forty-eight hours.</p>

<p>Mapleson had inured himself to this thought; he had made up his
mind to this conclusion from the first, and this last intimation
hardly affected him. He went about like one stunned, without
volition, without interest. He was only aware of a vast unhappiness
and misery of which White was in some way a factor.</p>

<p>For five days the wire-mattress agent lay on the verge of death,
and then he began to rally slightly. The house surgeon said it was
one of the most remarkable constitutions he had ever come up
against. For three days there was a distinct improvement, followed
by another relapse; but still White fought on. At the end of
another week he was out of danger, but the convalescence was long
and tedious.</p>

<p>When at the end of six weeks he was well enough to leave the
hospital, the house surgeon took him to one side and said:</p>

<p>"Now look here, my friend, we re going to let you out. And
there's no reason why you shouldn't get fairly well again. Only I
want you to understand this: if you touch alcohol again in any
form&mdash;in any case, for years&mdash;well, you might as well put
a bullet through your own head."</p>

<p>In another ten days White was back at business, looking exactly
the same as ever, speaking in the same suave voice. He soon
appeared in the Monitor, but with the utmost courtesy declined all
offers of drinks except ginger-ale. It need hardly be said that to
Mapleson such an event seemed a miracle. He had sunk into a low,
morbid condition from which he had never hoped to rise.</p>

<p>Out of courtesy the first evening Mapleson insisted on drinking
ginger-ale himself, so that his friend should not feel out of
it.</p>

<p>And they sat and had a discussion far into the night, White
giving luminous and precise details of the whole of his illness and
operation, eulogizing hospital methods, and discussing the whole
aspect of society towards therapeutics in a calmly detached
way.</p>

<p>But Mapleson was not happy. He was glad to have White back, but
the element of fear that White had introduced him to was not
eliminated. He felt ill himself, and there somehow seemed a great
gap between White in the old days and White drinking ginger-ale and
talking medicine. For three nights Mapleson kept this up, and then
thought he would have "just a night-cap."</p>

<p>It gradually developed into the position that Mapleson resumed
his whisky and White stuck to his ginger-ale; and it is a curious
fact that this arrangement depressed Mapleson more than it did
White. He drank copiously and more frequently in order to create an
atmosphere of his own; but always there was White looking just the
same, talking just the same.</p>

<p>The ginger-ale got on Mapleson's nerves. He felt that he
couldn't stand it, and a strange and enervating depression began to
creep over him again. For days this arrangement held good. White
seeming utterly indifferent as to what he drank, and Mapleson
getting more and more depressed because White didn't drink whisky.
At length Mapleson suggested one evening that "surely just one"
wouldn't hurt White. But White said with the deepest tone of regret
that he was afraid it would be rather unwise; and as a matter of
fact, he had got so used to doing without it that he really hardly
missed it.</p>

<p>From that moment a settled gloom and depression took hold of
Mapleson. He just stood there looking at White and listening to
him, but hardly troubling to speak himself. He felt utterly
wretched. He got into such a state that White began to show a
sympathetic alarm, and one evening toward the end of February, as
they were sitting at their favourite table in the Monitor, White
said, "Well, I'll just have a whisky and soda with you if you
like."</p>

<p>This was one of the happiest evenings of Mapleson's life. As
soon as his friend began to drink, some chord in his own nature
responded; his eyes glowed, he became garrulous and
entertaining.</p>

<p>They had another, and then went to a music-hall, into the
lounge; but there was such a crowd that they could not see the
stage, so they went to the bar at the back and had another drink
and a talk. How they talked that night! They talked about business
and dogs and conscription and women and the empire and tobacco and
the staff of Taunton's. They had a wild orgy of talk and drink.
That night White drank eleven whiskies and sodas, and Mapleson got
cheerfully and gloriously drunk.</p>

<p>It was perhaps as well that the friends enjoyed this
bacchanalia, for it was the last time they met. By four o'clock the
next afternoon White was dead.</p>

<p>Mapleson heard of it the following night. He was leaning against
the fireplace in the Monitor, expatiating upon the wonderful
improvement in White, and extolling his virtues, when young Howard
Aldridge, the junior salesman to Mr. Vincent Pelt of Taunton's,
came in to say that White's brother-in-law had just rung up Mr.
Pelt to say that White was dead. When Mapleson heard this he
muttered, "My Christ!"</p>

<p>These were the last words that Mapleson ever uttered in the bar
of the Monitor.</p>

<p>He picked up his hat and went out into the street. It was the
same feeling of numbed terror and physical sickness that assailed
him. With no plan of action arranged, he surprised his wife by
arriving home before ten o'clock and by going to bed. He was
shivering. She took him up a hot-water bottle and said, "I'm sorry
to hear about White." Mapleson didn't answer, but his teeth
chattered. He lay awake half the night thinking of death.</p>

<p>The next day he got up and went to business as usual, but for
the second time the head of the firm felt it his duty to point out
to him one or two cases of negligence and to warn him that "these
things must not happen in the future."</p>

<p>Two days later Mapleson received a postcard signed by "F.
Peabody," to say that the funeral of the late G. L. White would
take place at such-and-such a church at East Acton, and would leave
the "Elms," Castlereach Road, Acton, at twelve o'clock, and it was
intimated that a seat for Mr. Mapleson would be found in a
carriage.</p>

<p>A fine driving rain out of a leaden sky greeted Mapleson when he
set out for White's funeral on the Saturday. His wife tried to
persuade him not to go, for he was really ill; but he made no
comment. He fiddled about with a timetable, and could come to no
satisfactory decision about the way to get there. His wife
ultimately looked him up a train to Hammersmith, from which
terminus he could get a train. Before reaching Hammersmith a
strange revulsion came over him. Why, after all, should he go to
this funeral? White wouldn't know about it, and what did he know of
White's relatives? A strange choking and giddiness came over him,
and at Hammersmith he found a comfortable refreshment-room, where
he betook himself, and decided that after refreshing he would go on
to business.</p>

<p>After having two whiskies, however, he changed his mind. "No,"
he muttered to himself, "I'll see it through." He boarded a tram
that went in the direction of Acton. He found that he had to change
trams at one point. It seemed an interminable journey. He kept
wondering how White managed to get home at night from Oxford Street
at twelve o'clock. He felt cold and wretched as the effect of the
whisky wore off.</p>

<p>At last he reached Acton, and asked for Castlereach Road. Nobody
seemed to know it. He was directed first in one direction and then
in another; at last a postman put him on the right track, but
suggested that as it was some way, he might get a 'bus to Gaddes
Green, and then it was only about fifteen-minutes' walk.</p>

<p>Mapleson set off, keeping a sharp look-out for a place of
refreshment, for the reactionary spirit was once more upon him. The
'bus put him down at a forlorn-looking corner, where there was only
a sort of workman's ale-house. "I expect I'll pass one on the way,"
he thought, and taking his directions from the assistant of a
greengrocer's shop, he set out once more through the rain.</p>

<p>The farther he went, the meaner and more sordid did the streets
become. He did not pass a single public-house that he felt he could
approach. "I expect the neighbourhood will change soon," he
thought; "I expect I've come the wrong way. Why, everyone said
White must be making at least eight hundred a year. He wouldn't
live in a place like this."</p>

<p>At length he came to a break in the neighbourhood where some
newly-built villas crowded one another on the heels of the more
ancient squalor. An errand-boy told him that "Castlereach Road was
the second turning on the right off Goldsmith's Havenue." He found
Goldsmith's Avenue, where a barrel-organ was pouring forth
lugubrious music to an audience listening from the shelter of their
windows, and swarms of dirty children were hurrying through the
rain on nameless errands. A piece of bread and jam was thrown from
a second-story window to a little boy in the street, and missed
Mapleson's hat by inches. His progress was in any case the source
of considerable mirth to the inhabitants.</p>

<p>At last he came to Castlereach Road. After the noise and bustle
of Goldsmith's Avenue, it seemed like the end of the world. It was
a long straight road of buff-coloured villas, with stucco facings
and slate roofs, all identically the same. From the end, where
Mapleson entered it, it looked interminable and utterly deserted.
Doubtless, if it had been a fine day, the gutters would have been
crowded with children; but with the pouring rain, there was not a
soul in sight.</p>

<p>Mapleson blundered on in search of Number 227, and as he did so,
a thought occurred to him that he and White had a common secret
apart. He always had felt in his inmost heart a little ashamed of
his red-brick villa in Willesden Green, and that was one reason why
he had always kept business well apart from domestic affairs; and
White had casually referred to his "place at Acton." His place at
Acton! Mapleson entered it, horribly tired, horribly sober,
horribly wretched. All the blinds were down. It had taken so long
to get there he hoped that he was too late.</p>

<p>A tall, gaunt woman in black, with a slight down on her upper
lip, opened the door. She seemed surprised to see him.</p>

<p>He explained who he was.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. My! you are early. It's only half-past twelve.</p>

<p>"Half-past twelve?" said Mapleson. "But I thought the funeral
was to be at twelve."</p>

<p>Then the gaunt woman called into a little side room:</p>

<p>"'Ere Uncle Frank, what 'ave you been up to? Did you tell Mr.
Myple that the funeral was at twelve?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't sye that; don't sye that!" came a voice from the
room, and a small man, with sandy hair and wizened features and
small, dark, greedy eyes, came out into the hall. "Oh, don't sye
that, Mr. Mypleson! I'm Peabody. I quite thought I said two
o'clock."</p>

<p>Mapleson had a wild impulse to whistle for a cab or a
fire-engine, and to drive away from this anywhere; but the utter
helplessness of his position held him fast. Before he had time to
give the matter serious thought he was being shown into the
drawing-room, a small stuffy room with a blue floral wall-paper,
bamboo furniture, and many framed photographs, and the gaunt woman
was saying, "Oh, Uncle Frank, how could you have made that
mistyke!" And Uncle Frank was explaining how it might have occurred
and at the same time saying that they must make the'best of it;
that Mr. Mapleson would have a bit of lunch. There was a nice cut
of cold leg of mutton, and of course no one, under circumstances
like this, would expect an <i>elaborate</i> meal; in fact, no one
would <i>feel</i> like it, apart from anything else. And then the
gaunt woman left the room, and Mapleson was alone with Uncle
Frank.</p>

<p>Mapleson could not recollect ever having met anyone whom he so
cordially hated at sight. He had a sort of smug perpetual grin, a
habit of running his hands down his thighs as far as his knees, and
giving vent to a curious clicking noise with his cheeks.</p>

<p>"Well, this is a very sad hoccasion, Mr. Mypleson," he said;
"very sad indeed. Poor George! Did you know him well? Eva&mdash;his
wife, you know&mdash;she's upstairs quite prostrate. That was her
sister who showed you in. Yes, yes, well, how true it is that in
the midst of life we are in death! I'm afraid poor George was
careless, you know. Very careless. Clever, mind you&mdash;clever as
they make 'em, but careless. Do you know, Mr. Mypleson, he hadn't
even insured his life! And he's left no will. There isn't enough to
pay his funeral expenses. Fortunately, Eva's clever; oh, yes, she's
clever with her fingers. They say there's no one in the
neighbourhood to touch her in the millinery. Oh, yes, she's been at
it some time. Why, bless my soul, do you know she's paid the rent
of this 'ouse for the last four years? Oh, she's a clever woman.
Poor soul, though, her great consolation is that George didn't die
in the 'orspital. Yes, Mr. Mypleson, he died upstairs, quiet as a
lamb. She was there at the end. It was a great consolation."</p>

<p>And Uncle Frank nodded his head, and his little eyes sparkled,
but the grin never left his lips. Mapleson said nothing, but the
two men sat there in a sombre silence. Uncle Frank occasionally
nodding his head and muttering, "It's a sad hoccasion."</p>

<p>The rain increased, and it seemed unnaturally dark in the blue
drawing-room, and Mapleson felt that he had sat there an eternity,
consumed by desire to get away, when there was another knock at the
door, and a youth was let in.</p>

<p>Uncle Frank called him Chris, and he seemed to be a cousin, or
some near relative of White's. He was a raw youth who had just gone
to business, and was very much aware of his collar and cuffs. He
seemed to take to Mapleson, and he sat watching him furtively.
Mapleson seemed a man of the world, a very desirable personality.
The youth made many advances, but the latter felt a repugnance for
him in only a slightly less degree than in the case of Uncle
Frank.</p>

<p>At length the gaunt sister asked them all into the diningroom,
which was a room on the other side of the passage that seemed even
smaller and stuffier than the drawingroom. It was papered with a
dark-red paper, and the woodwork was painted chocolate. As they
crossed the hall, they passed Mrs. White, who had apparently been
persuaded by her sister "to try and take something." She was a
shrivelled little person, with white cheeks, and her eyes were red
with weeping.</p>

<p>She hurried by the men without speaking, and a curious thought
struck Mapleson. During the twenty years or so that he had known
White he could not recollect him speaking of his wife. He probably
had done so, but he could not recollect it. He remembered him
talking about his "place at Acton," but never of his wife. He did
not feel entirely surprised. White was probably ashamed.</p>

<p>In the window of the dining-room were several birdcages,
containing two canaries, a bullfinch, and a small highly-coloured
bird that hopped from the floor of its cage to a perch and kept up
a toneless squeak, with monotonous regularity. Uncle Frank went up
to the cage and tapped the wires, and called out, "Ah, there he is!
<i>Cheep! cheep!</i> This is our little Orstrylian bird, Mr.
Mapleson. Isn't he? Yes, yes; he's our clever little Orstrylian
bird." And during the course of the hurried meal of cold mutton and
cheese the birds formed a constant diversion. Uncle Frank would
continually jump up and call out, "Oh, yes, he's our little
Orstrylian bird."</p>

<p>Mapleson tried to recall whether he had ever discussed birds
with White, and he felt convinced that he had not. It seemed a
strange thing. White apparently had had these birds for some
time&mdash;three different varieties in his own house! Mapleson
would have enjoyed talking about birds with White; he could almost
hear White's voice, and his precise and suave manner of discussing
their ways and peculiarities. And the terrible thought came to him
that he would never hear White talk about birds, never, never. This
breach of confidence on White's part of never telling him that he
kept birds upset Mapleson even more than his breach of confidence
in not talking about his wife.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, he's a clever little Orstrylian bird." A terrible
desire came to Mapleson to throw Uncle Frank through the window the
next time he heard this remark.</p>

<p>Before they had finished the meal, three other male relatives
appeared, and a terrible craving came over Mapleson for a drink.
Then the sister came down with a decanter of sherry and said that
perhaps the gentlemen would like a glass. Uncle Frank poured out a
glass all round. It was thin, sickly stuff, and to the brass-bed
manager like a thimbleful of dew in a parched desert. A horrible
feeling of repugnance came over him&mdash;of repugnance against all
these people, against the discomfort he found himself in.</p>

<p>After all, who was White? When all was said and done. White was
really nothing to him, only a man he'd met in the course of
business and had a lot of drinks and talks with. At that moment he
felt he disliked White and all his snivelling relatives.</p>

<p>He wanted to go, to get away from it all; but he couldn't see
how. There was half a glass of sherry left in the decanter. He
unblushingly took it as the funeral cortege arrived. There were two
ramshackle carriages and a hearse, and a crowd of dirty children
had collected. He tried to mumble to Uncle Frank some excuse for
not going, but his words were lost by an intensely painful scene
that took place in the hall as the coffin was brought down. He did
not notice that the sister with the down on her upper lip became an
inspired creature for a few moments, and her face became almost
beautiful.</p>

<p>He felt that he was an alien element among all these people,
that they were nothing to him, and that he was nothing to them, and
he felt an intense, insatiable desire for a drink. If he couldn't
get a drink, he felt he would go mad.</p>

<p>Someone touched him on the arm and said, "Will you come with us
in the second carriage, Mr. Mapleson?" He felt himself walking out
of the house and through a row of dirty children. For a moment he
contemplated bolting up the street and out of sight, but the
feeling that the children would probably follow him and jeer
paralysed this action; and then he was in the carriage, with Chris
and another male relative who was patently moved by the solemnity
of the occasion.</p>

<p>Chris wriggled about and tried to engage him in banal
conversation, with an air that suggested, "Of course, Mr. Mapleson,
this is a sad affair, but we men of the world know how to
behave."</p>

<p>The dismal cortege proceeded at an ambling trot, occasionally
stopping. Chris gave up for the moment trying to be entertaining,
and the forlorn relative talked about funeral services and the
comfort of sympathy in time of bereavement. They crawled past rows
of congested villas and miles of indescribable domesticity of every
kind, till as they were turning round a rather broader avenue than
usual where there were shops, the forlorn relative said, "We shall
be in the cemetery in five minutes."</p>

<p>And then Mapleson had an inspiration. They were ambling along
this dreary thoroughfare when his eye suddenly caught sight of a
large and resplendent public-house. It was picked out in two shades
of green, and displayed a gilt sign-board denoting "The Men of
Kent."</p>

<p>Almost without thinking, and certainly in less time than it
takes to chronicle, Mapleson muttered something to his two
companions, and called out of the window to the driver to stop. He
then jumped out, and called out to the driver of the hearse and the
other carriage to stop, and then before anyone realized what it was
all about, he darted into the saloon bar of The Men of Kent!</p>

<p>The bar was fortunately empty, but through the little glass
shutters two women and a man in the private bar watched the
performance.</p>

<p>There was a moment of dazed surprise, followed by a high shriek
of laughter and a woman's voice in strident crescendo:</p>

<p>"He's stopped the funeral to come in an' 'ave a drink! O my
Gawd!" Mapleson's tongue seemed to cling to the roof of his mouth,
but he gasped out an order for a whisky and soda. To the barman
these incidents were nothing, and he served the drink instantly;
but to the three in the private bar it was a matter of intense
enjoyment. The other woman took it up.</p>

<p>"Well, that's the first time I've known that 'appen. Gawd! fancy
stoppin' a funeral to come and 'ave a drink!" Then the man bawled
out: "'Ere, I sye, ain't the others cornin' in? Let's make a dye of
it."</p>

<p>The women continued shrieking with laughter, and the appalling
ignominy of his position came home to him. He knew that he was
damned in the eyes of White's friends.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, the thought of White had passed out of his
mind altogether. He was a thing in revolt against society, without
feelings and without principles.</p>

<p>Yet when the whisky was put in front of him his hand trembled,
and he could not drink it. He fumbled with the glass, threw down a
sixpence, and darted out of the bar again.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile Uncle Frank and other members of the funeral
party had got out of the carriages and were having a whispered
consultation on the curb. Instructions had evidently been given for
the cortege to proceed, for Uncle Frank was talking to the driver
of the hearse when Mapleson appeared.</p>

<p>As all returned to the carriages, the three people came out of
the bar and raised a cheer, and one of the women called out, "Oh, I
sye, don't go!"</p>

<p>Mapleson lay all of a heap in the corner of the carriage, and he
noticed that he was alone with Chris. The forlorn relative had gone
into the other carriage.</p>

<p>In a few minutes they arrived at a church, a large new building
with Early Victorian Gothic arches and a profusion of coloured
glass. The funeral party huddled together in the gloom of the large
church, and somehow the paucity of their numbers seemed even more
depressing than the wretchedness of their appearance.</p>

<p>Mapleson sat a little way back, and curiously enough his mind
kept reverting during the service to the little birds. He felt a
distinct grievance against White on account of the little birds.
Why hadn't he told him, especially about the small Australian bird?
It would have made a distinctly interesting subject of
conversation.</p>

<p>The service seemed interminably long, and it was a relief when
the tall, rather good-looking young clergyman led the way out into
the cemetery. The rain was still driving in penetrating gusts, and
as they stood by the grave-side, the relatives looked askance at
one another, uncertain whether it was the proper thing to do to
hold up an umbrella. As to Mapleson, he was indifferent. For one
thing, he had not brought an umbrella; but it seemed frightfully
cold.</p>

<p>They lowered the coffin into the grave and earth was sprinkled.
For a second it flashed through his mind, "That's White being let
down," and then a feeling of indifference and repugnance followed,
and the craving desire to get away from all these sordid
happenings. Then he suddenly thought of White's wife. "A
miserable-looking slattern she was," he thought. "Why, what was she
snivelling about? What could she have been to White or White to
her? Why, he never mentioned her during twenty years!"</p>

<p>He experienced a slight feeling of relief when the service was
finished and the party broke up, and he hastily made for the
cemetery gates, knowing that White's friends would be as anxious to
avoid him as he was to avoid them; but he had not reached them
before some one, hurrying up behind, caught him. It was Chris.</p>

<p>"I expect you're going up west, Mr. Mapleson," he said. "If it's
not putting myself in the way, I'll come too."</p>

<p>Mapleson gave an inarticulate grunt that conveyed nothing at
all; but the young man was not to be put off.</p>

<p>There was something about the bulk of Mapleson and the pendulous
lines of his clothes and person that made Chris feel, when he was
walking with him, that he was "knocking about town" and "mixing
with the world." He himself was apprenticed to a firm of wall-paper
manufacturers and he felt that Mapleson would be able to enlighten
him on the prospects and the outlook of the furnishing and
decorating trade. He talked gaily of antique furniture till they
came to a gaunt yellow-brick station.</p>

<p>On enquiry, there seemed to be no trains that went from it to
any recognizable or habitable spot, but outside were two melancholy
hackney-carriages. By this time Mapleson was desperate, and a
strange feeling of giddiness possessed him.</p>

<p>He got in, and told the driver vaguely "to drive up to London."
Chris came to the rescue, and explained to him that he might drive
to Shepherd's Bush first. They started off, and rattled once more
through the wilderness of dreary villas.</p>

<p>The young man accepted the position he found himself in with
perfect composure. He attributed Mapleson's silence to an expansive
boredom, and he talked with discretion and with a sort of callow
tact. Before they reached Shepherd's Bush, however, Mapleson
muttered something about feeling faint, and Chris immediately
suggested that they should go and have a drink. "You might bring me
something in," said Mapleson. "I'll have a brandy neat." They drove
helplessly through neat avenues and roads for nearly ten minutes
without passing anything in the way of a public-house. At last they
came to a grocer's shop licensed to sell spirits not to be consumed
on the premises. "Go and buy me a bottle of brandy," said Mapleson.
The young man got out, and soon returned with a six-and-sixpenny
bottle of brandy and a corkscrew. He paid for it himself, relying
on the natural honour of Mapleson to settle up afterwards, but the
matter was never mentioned again.</p>

<p>He drew the cork, and Mapleson took a long drink, and then wiped
the mouth of the bottle and offered it to Chris. Chris behaved like
a man, and also took a draught, but spluttered rather.</p>

<p>For the rest of the journey Mapleson at regular intervals took
thoughtful and meditative drinks, and gradually began to revive. He
went so far as to ask Chris if he knew anything about the little
birds, and how long White had had them. Chris said he knew he had
had the canaries for four or five years and the bullfinch for two
years. He didn't know much about the little Australian bird. This
information seemed to cause Mapleson to revert to his former
gloom.</p>

<p>When they reached Shepherd's Bush the cabman refused to go
farther. So they got out, and entered another cab, Mapleson
carrying the brandy-bottle under his arm. He took it upon himself
to tell the cabman&mdash;this time a taxi&mdash;to "drive round the
Outer Circle of Hyde Park, and to take the hood down."</p>

<p>It was about half-past four when they reached Hyde Park, and the
rain had ceased a little. It was the fashionable hour for the
afternoon drive. Magnificent motors and two-horse phaetons were
ambling round well within the regulation limit. Their cab was soon
almost hemmed in by the equipages of the great world. But after
they had completed the circle once, and Mapleson lay back, with his
feet on the opposite seat and his hat brushed the wrong way, and
without the slightest compunction held the large brandy-bottle to
his lips every few yards, Chris began to feel that there was a
limit to his desire to "mix with the world."</p>

<p>He got the cab to stop near the Marble Arch, and explained to
Mapleson that he must get out and take the tube to business.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
And then there was a scene. Mapleson, who up to that time had not
addressed a personal word to Chris, suddenly became maudlin. He
cried, and said that he had never taken to anyone as he had to
Chris. He was the dearest fellow in the world; he mustn't leave
him; now that White was dead, he was the only friend he had.</p>

<p>But people began to collect on the side-walk, and Chris simply
ran off. The taxi-driver began to be suspicious about his fare,
which was registered fourteen shillings. But Mapleson gave him a
sovereign on account, and told him to drive to Cleopatra's Needle,
on the Embankment.</p>

<p>By the time they reached there, the brandy-bottle was
three-quarters empty, and tears were streaming down his cheeks. He
offered the driver a drink, but the driver was "not one of that
sort," and gruffly suggested that Mapleson "had better drive 'ome."
So he got out of the cab pathetically, settled with the driver, and
sat on a seat of the Embankment, hugging his bottle and staring at
the river.</p>

<p>Now, it is very difficult to know exactly what Mapleson did the
rest of that afternoon between the time when he dismissed the
cabman and half-past eight, when he turned up in the bar of the
<i>Monitor</i>.</p>

<p>It is only known that he struggled in there at that time,
looking as white as a sheet. He was wet through, and his clothes
were covered with mud. He struggled across to the comer where he
and White used to sit, and sat down. The bar was fairly crowded at
the time, and young Chris made his début there. He felt that he
would be a person of interest. When Mapleson appeared, he went up
to him, but Mapleson didn't know him, and said nothing.</p>

<p>Several others came up and advised Mapleson to go home and
change his clothes and have a drink first; but he just stared
stupidly ahead and made no comment. Someone brought some whisky and
put it before him, but he ignored it. They then came to the
conclusion that he was ill, so they sent for a cab, and two of them
volunteered to see him home.</p>

<p>Just as they were about to lead him out he stood up. He then
stretched out his arms and waved them away. He picked up the glass
of whisky and raised it slowly to his lips; but before it reached
them, he dropped it, and fell backward across the table.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
"Women, you know," said Charlie Maybird some months later,
addressing two friends in the Monitor, "are silly creatures. They
think love and friendship is all a question of kissin' and
cuddlin'. They think business is all buyin' and sellin'; they don't
think men can make friendships in business. Crikey! I reckon
there's more friendships made in business&mdash;real friendships, I
mean&mdash;than ever there is outside. Look at the case of White
and Mapleson. I tell you, those two men loved each other. For over
twenty years they were inseparable; there was nothing they would
not have done for each other; hand and glove they was over
everything. I've never seen a chap crumple up so as Mapleson did
when White died, in fact from the very day when White was took ill.
He went about like a wraith. I'll never forget that night when he
came in here after the funeral. He sat over
there&mdash;look&mdash;by the fireplace. He looked as though his
'eart was broken. Suddenly he stood up and lifted his glass, and
then dropped it, and then fell backwards crash on to the floor.
They took him to the 'orspital, but he never regained
consciousness. The doctors said it was fatty degeneration of the
'eart, 'elped on by some kidney trouble; but I know better. He died
of a broken 'eart. Lord, yes;11 tell you, there's a lot of romance
in the furnishing trade."</p>

<p>"Did he leave any money?" asked one of the friends.</p>

<p>"My word, yes; more than White," answered the genial Charles.
"White never left a bean, and it seems his missus had not only been
paying the rent out of her millinery, but allowed White some. White
was a card, he was."</p>

<p>"And what did Mapleson leave?"</p>

<p>"Mapleson left nearly four pounds."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"Four pounds and a wife and five kids, the eldest twelve."</p>

<p>"A wife and five kids! How the hell does she manage to keep
things going?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Gawd knows! Come, let's go over to the Oxford and see
what's on."</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. THE PERSISTENT MOTHER</h2>

<p>The refinement of the Bindloss family was a by-word in
Tibbelsford. Mr. Bindloss himself was a retired printer. Now as
everyone knows printing is the most respectable of professions, but
retirement is the most refined profession of all. It suggests
vested interests, getting up late in the morning, having a nap in
the afternoon, and voting for keeping things stable. But Mr.
Bindloss was by no means an inactive man. He was a sidesman at St.
Mark's Church, tended his own garden, grew tomatoes, supervised the
education of his two daughters, sat on the committee of the
Tibbelsford Temperance League, and the Domestic Pets Defence
League. Mrs. Bindloss was even more refined, for it was rumoured
that he was distantly related to a lord. She certainly spoke in
that thin precise manner which was easily associable with the
aristocracy; a manner which her daughters imitated to perfection.
The elder daughter Gwendoline who was sixteen, was in her last term
at Miss Langton Matravers' school; whilst the younger daughter
Mildred was in her first term at that same institution. One might
mention in passing that Miss Langton Matravers prided herself that
she only catered for daughters of the gentry. The family lived in a
neat semi-detached villa in the Quorn Road.</p>

<p>Now it came to pass in the fullness of time that Mr. Bindloss
realized that he was not so well off as he thought he was, or as he
used to be. He discovered that the money that he had made by honest
toil in the printing trade was now described as unearned increment,
and taxed accordingly. Moreover, it did not go so far as it didin
the good old days of his early retirement. In those days Mrs.
Bindloss was able to secure a nice pliable servant, who would work
twelve hours a day, sleep in, and only ask for every other Sunday
afternoon off, for fourteen pounds a year. Now the only domestic
help she could secure was a fugitive procession of strange women,
who came daily and demanded a pound a week, all their evenings off
as well as Sundays. Even then they did not appear eager for the
work. They would turn up, take stock of the household, eat a few
huge meals, smash a few plates, and vanish. It was very trying. Why
couldn't things remain as they were?</p>

<p>One spring morning Mr. Bindloss was in the garden thinning out
some young cabbage plants, when his wife came out to him, holding a
letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"I've had a letter from Agnes," she said.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Mr. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"She says that the Northallertons have gone to live at
Tollinghurst."</p>

<p>"Really!" said Mr. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"Yes. Do you know that young Archie Northallerton may one day be
Lord Windlass?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nice!" said Mr. Bindloss, who was apt to be a little
preoccupied when gardening.</p>

<p>"Put that trowel down, Julian, and listen to me," said his
wife.</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloss knew when he was spoken to, and he obeyed.</p>

<p>"Young Archie is just fourteen. Tollinghurst is only half an
hour's journey by train. Does anything strike you?"</p>

<p>"Not forcibly," replied Mr. Bindloss, scratching his head behind
the left ear.</p>

<p>"No, I suppose it wouldn't," snapped the refined Mrs. Bindloss.
"Does it not occur to you that this boy is fourteen, that is to say
that he is two years older than Mildred and two years younger than
Gwen?"</p>

<p>The eyes of Mr. Bindloss narrowed. His wife's implication became
clear to him.</p>

<p>"What a thing it is to have a clever wife,"' he said
defensively, then added:</p>

<p>"It's a bit young though to think
of&mdash;er&mdash;marriage."</p>

<p>"It's not too young to <i>begin</i> to think about it."</p>

<p>"No, no, that's true, that's very true. What do you propose to
do, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Write to his mother, and suggest their bringing or sending the
boy over for the day."</p>

<p>"Excellent, you know her, of course?"</p>

<p>"I haven't actually met her, but she will know of me naturally.
We are distantly related."</p>

<p>"You say that boy <i>may be</i> Lord Cutlass. Let's see, what is
the exact relationship? You did tell me but I have forgotten."</p>

<p>"Windlass not Cutlass. It's like this&mdash;my sister married a
Bream, who are cousins to the Northallertons. Henry Bolsover
Northallerton, the father of this boy, is the younger brother of
Lord Windlass, who is a middle-aged bachelor. If he leaves no heirs
Archie will inherit the estates and the title."</p>

<p>"I see, your's is not exactly a blood relationship, then. I mean
to say there would be no obstacles&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No obstacles at all. The Northallertons in any case are a very
good family and very wealthy."</p>

<p>"Well, of course, my dear, I shan't stand in your way. Indeed,
I'll do my best to make the young gentleman's visit enjoyable." So
Mr. Bindloss returned to his cabbages and Mrs. Bindloss to the
library, where she wrote the following letter:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mrs. Northallerton,<br>
<br>
Forgive my writing you as I don't think we have ever actually met.
My dear sister's husband, Samuel Bream, used to speak so
affectionately about you all. Happening to hear that you have come
to live in the neighbourhood I wonder whether you would give us the
great pleasure of a visit. My dear husband, who has retired from
business and my two daughters and myself, would be delighted to
welcome you. We live in a modest way, but we have a very pleasant
garden, as this is my husband's special hobby. I hear you have a
small boy. We should be so pleased if you would bring him too, as
we are all devoted to boys.<br>
<br>
Believe me, dear Mrs. Northallerton,<br>
Yours cordially,<br>
Cora Bindloss.</p>

<p>This letter elicited no reply for five days. At length one
morning came the following:</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mrs. Bindloss,<br>
<br>
Thank you for your letter. Yes, I remember hearing my cousin speak
of you. I'm afraid I cannot come oyer to see you just now, as I
have several house-parties coming on, and Archie is attending
school. Perhaps some time when you are in the neighbourhood you
will give me a call.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely,<br>
Constance Northallerton.</p>

<p>To some people this reply would have been accepted as rather in
the nature of a snub, but not so to Mrs. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"It gives me a loophole," she explained to her husband. "I shall
wait a decent period, and then happen to be in the
neighbourhood."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact she waited fourteen days. It is possible
that she might have called on Mrs. Northallerton sooner, but this
interlude had been devoted to the making of an ill-afforded new
frock. At the end of that period she took the train to
Tollinghurst, and walked sedately up to "The Three Gables," only
alas! to find Mrs. Northallerton had gone up to town for a few
days. Whatever faults Mrs. Bindloss may have had a lack of tenacity
of purpose was not one. Three times during the course of a
fortnight she "happened to be in the nieghbourhood" of
Toilinghurst. On the third occasion she ran her quarry to earth.
Mrs. Northallerton was just going out but she was graciously
pleased to entertain Mrs. Bindloss for a quarter of an hour. The
latter, was at her very best. She flattered her hostess about her
house, her clothes, her appearance, and her intelligence in accents
so refined as to be almost painful. No one is entirely immune to
flattery and Mrs. Northallerton could not help but be polite and a
little cordial. Towards the end of the interview Mrs. Bindloss
said:</p>

<p>"And how's that dear boy of yours? Archie, isn't his name?"</p>

<p>"Oh, he's very well. He's at school. He goes to Headingley, you
know."</p>

<p>"Really, <i>how</i> interesting!" exclaimed Mrs. Bindloss. "I
hear it's such an excellent school. It is the great grief of my
husband and myself that we never had a boy. My husband adores boys.
It would be so delightful if you would let er-Archie come over and
see us one day&mdash;perhaps during the holidays."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I expect he would like to come very much,"
replied Mrs. Northallerton, without any great show of enthusiasm.
"He's just got his school cap&mdash;maroon and black stripes. He's
very pleased with himself."</p>

<p>"How delightful! I <i>do</i> think maroon and black is a
delightful combination. I expect he's a very clever boy, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"They seem to think so, Mrs. Bindloss. He's very good at Latin
and botany."</p>

<p>"Really, how splendid, Mrs. Northallerton. He would get on
admirably with my husband. He doesn't know <i>much</i> Latin. He
can't speak it you know; but he knows <i>all</i> about botany. You
should see the tomatoes he grows."</p>

<p>"Indeed! Well, it's very good of you to call, but I'm afraid I
really must be going now."</p>

<p>"Of course, oh dear! I'm afraid I'm an awful chatterbox,
especially when I meet someone <i>really</i> interesting."</p>

<p>When Mrs. Bindloss returned home that evening she was able to
announce that she had made a conquest, that Mrs. Northallerton was
charming, and that the boy was certainly coming over to visit the
family during the holidays. She also said that her husband and both
the girls were to study hard at Latin and botany. Now this command
led to a good deal of unpleasantness. The little Latin that Mr.
Bindloss had learnt at school he had almost entirely forgotten. It
seemed rather much to expect, at his time of life, that at the end
of a day's gardening when his natural inclinations were to sit down
and read the newspaper, he should have to try and learn up passages
from Virgil. The girls said they hated botany and had no books on
it. This defect was rapidly put right by Mrs. Bindloss, who went
into the town and bought "Green's Life of the Plant" and "Morgan's
Botany for Beginners."</p>

<p>"You will study these books, Gwendoline and Mildred, or there
will be no flower show and Church bazaar for you next month."</p>

<p>Under this dire menace the two girls steeled themselves to grasp
the first principles of plant life. And during the ensuing summer
months Mrs. Bindloss did her best to train their minds in some of
the principles of human life. She did it quietly and insinuatingly.
She pointed out how in a few years time they would come to the
stage when they would require to marry. She limned all the beauties
and advantages of married life. She dwelt upon her own happy
married life, only handicapped by the eternal lack of funds.
Everything was so expensive now. Unless one was very, very rich one
had to do one's own housework. (The two girls she knew hated
housework.) Then she began gradually to talk about young Archie
Northallerton. She had heard that he was a perfectly charming boy,
very kind, clever, and gentlemanly. He would one day probably be
Lord Windlass; in any case he would be very rich. -A woman who
married him would be a real lady, and would never have to do any
housework at all. She did not think it advisable to go any further.
The affair did not make much impression on Mildred. She was of the
age which is more interested in meringues than marriage. But
Gwendoline was sixteen, and was beginning to be absorbed in erotic
literature. In reading of the doings of Ivanhoe and Lancelot it
occurred to her sometimes that Tibbelsford was a drab little town.
And she dreamed of a knight on a white charger, riding up to number
27, Quorn Road, and snatching her up&mdash;one evening perhaps when
she was watering the syringa in the front garden&mdash;and carrying
her off and whispering in her ear:</p>

<p>"Come, my beloved, I will make you a Lady. Come with me to my
castle on the other side of the dark wood."</p>

<p>She dwelt rather unduly on these visions.</p>

<p>As the summer advanced the family began to discuss the best way
to entertain the future lord. It was to be assumed that it would be
a fine day. Now Mr. Bindloss took a great pride in his lawn, which
he kept rolled and cut himself. He had never allowed tennis or any
other game to be played on it, but discussing the matter in bed one
night with his wife, they agreed that a game of some sort would
have obvious advantages. It would bring the young people into more
intimate relationship. But tennis? none of the family played
tennis, and it was doubtful if the lawn was quite large enough. But
what about croquet? Croquet was a nice quiet game that didn't
require running about, and would not be likely to do damage to the
flower beds. Yes, croquet they decided was just the thing.</p>

<p>The next day Mr. Bindloss wrote up to town and had a croquet set
sent down. When it arrived he and his wife pored over the rules.
They seemed extremely complicated, and the girls were called in to
give their help. The only solution seemed to be set up the hoops
and experiment.</p>

<p>"We must be able to play a decent game when Archie comes," said
Gwendoline, who quickly showed herself the most proficient
performer of the family. Nearly every afternoon for some weeks the
Bindloss family practised croquet, much to the astonishment of
their neighbours. Mr. Bindloss had to explain to Mr. Longman next
door that the exercise was good for the girls. This was a good
enough reason, but whatever physical benefits may have accrued it
cannot be said that the mental effect was satisfactory. There is
perhaps no game at which people can so easily and persistently lose
their tempers as croquet. There were furious arguments and-disputes
about the rules. Moreover, Mr. Bindloss objected to being beaten,
and the girls accused him of cheating. Mr. Bindloss always played
with the wrong ball, and swore it was the right one. Eventually the
parents gave it up, and left the girls to play alone. Mildred hated
the game, and was forced to play as though it were taking medicine.
They also bought a box of draughts, and a box of Halma, in case it
should be a wet day, when Archie came. Early in July Mrs. Bindloss
again wrote to Mrs. Northallerton, a chatty friendly little letter,
ending up by hoping that at the end of the term Mrs. Northallerton
would remember her promise to bring Archie over for the day.</p>

<p>She received no reply to this, so she wrote again a week later,
saying that she feared her letter must have miscarried and
repeating her invitation. There was still no answer, and it was
near the end of July. The situation was desperate. She knew the
school must have broken up. Some women would have given up in
despair, but not so Mrs. Bindloss. She wrote once more, and said
that as the weather was so fine and Mr. Bindloss's roses were now
at their best, wouldn't Mrs. Northallerton and Archie come over the
following Wednesday to lunch and spend the afternoon? Her
persistence reaped its reward. Two days later came a telegram from
somewhere in Yorkshire. "Many thanks am arranging to send Archie
next Wednesday. Train arrives 12.45. Northallerton."</p>

<p>Triumph! Mrs. Bindloss glowed with it. And then what a to-do
there was. The girls' new taffeta frocks had been in preparation
for some time and were quickly finished off. Mr. Bindloss was
bought a new alpaca coat and a Panama hat. A new loose cover was
made for the best armchair in the drawing-room. And a man was sent
for to mend all kinds of household defects, attention to which was
considerably overdue.</p>

<p>"And now we must consider the lunch and the tea," said Mrs.
Bindloss.</p>

<p>It was decided that you could not give a potential lord anything
less than chicken. The question was ought they to have soup and
fish as well. After a deal of argument they decided to have soup
only, for the reason that they were short of plates, and if Annie,
the daily help, had to wash up plates between courses, she would
probably lose her head. Of course there must be some nice sweets
and pastry, but these could be prepared beforehand. And for the tea
there must be a goodly assortment of cakes, jam and cream.</p>

<p>"A young gentleman like that is sure to appreciate such things,"
said Mrs. Bindloss, "and if we do it well he will be more likely to
come again."</p>

<p>At length the great day dawned. Mrs. Bindloss was up early. She
peered out of her bedroom window anxiously. Yes, the day promised
to be fine. She got up and dressed and roused the rest of the
family. There would be plenty to do for everyone. Annie couldn't be
relied on to cook such an elaborate meal by herself. Mrs. Bindloss
had had to scold her the day before for carelessness. Mrs. Bindloss
dressed feverishly. Annie of course was late. She <i>would</i> be
on such an important occasion. Came half past seven and then eight
and still no Annie. The girls were bustled out of bed and made to
get breakfast. The family started the day with bad tempers.</p>

<p>"It's no good getting agitated," said Mr. Bindloss, coming into
the dining-room just as the breakfast was on the table.</p>

<p>"It's all very well for some people," snapped Mrs. Bindloss.
"Some people don't have all the work and worry of it."</p>

<p>After a sketchy breakfast Mildred was sent into the town on her
bicycle to beat up the lagging Annie. She returned in half an
hour's time with a message from Miss Annie Woppins to the effect
that that lady had no longer any intention of "obliging Mrs. B.
after the saucy way she spoke to her yesterday."</p>

<p>Consternation and fury in the Bindloss family.</p>

<p>"We must make the best of it," said Mr. Bindloss, lighting his
pipe. "We must meet the situation with Christian fortitude."</p>

<p>"Yes, and perhaps you'll go and get some coals in," said Mrs.
Bindloss. "Mildred, get on your bicycle again and go and see if you
can get Mrs. Betts, or that other woman in Stone's
passage&mdash;what's her name? the one with a moustache."</p>

<p>"We can't have that awful apparition about for Archie to see,"
exclaimed Gwen.</p>

<p>"You'd better get on with the housework," said Mrs. Bindloss,
"and be quick about it. And, Mildred, on the way back, call at
Fleming's and order the dog-cart to be here sharp at twelve to take
some of us to the station. Julian, after you've got the coals in,
you can clean the knives, and then roll the lawn and put up the
croquet hoops."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bindloss's annoyance about the defection of Annie was
mellowed by a certain cynical enjoyment at rubbing it in about the
sordidness of domestic drudgery. It would be an object lesson to
the girls. Having borne the burden of the fight so far, she meant
to stand no nonsense from the family. For the next few hours the
house was in a turmoil. Mildred returned to say that neither Mrs.
Betts, nor the woman with a moustache were available. Mrs. Bindloss
proceeded with her preparations for lunch, whilst her husband and
daughters were sent flying round at her commands. It was decided
that the correct thing to do was for Mr. and Mrs. Bindloss to go to
the station themselves in the dog-cart to meet the future Lord
Windlass, whilst the girls remained behind to change into the new
taffeta frocks and at the same time to keep an eye on the fowl and
the vegetables. It must be acknowledged that under the very trying
circumstances Mrs. Bindloss managed efficiently. All the
preparations were carefully made, and when the dog-cart arrived at
twelve o'clock, she was ready in the hall pulling on her new white
gloves.</p>

<p>They arrived at the station a good quarter of an hour before the
train came in. Mrs. Bindloss was one of those women who are always
pecking at their husbands. That is to say she was always darting at
him and pulling his waistcoat down, putting his tie straight, or
picking little bits of cotton off his coat. This quarter of an hour
was fully occupied in this way, amplified by various
wishing-to-goodnesses he would do this, that, and the other in
regard to his clothes.</p>

<p>At length the train came in. It was a slack hour, and a mere
handful of people got out. In this company it was not difficult to
discriminate which was the future Lord Windlass. The rest were
ordinary market folk. Apart from being obviously what is known as
"upper class, he was wearing the maroon and black striped cap which
his mother had spoken to Mrs. Bindloss about. He came swinging
along the platform, and he was carrying curiously enough&mdash;two
fishing-rods in canvas coverings and a brown paper parcel.</p>

<p>"Leave this to me," whispered Mrs. Bindloss. When the boy was
within hailing distance she cried out in her most refined
accent:</p>

<p>"So here you are, Archie! Welcome to Tibbelsford!"</p>

<p>She held out her hand, and he took it shyly. On close
examination it could not be said that the future Lord Windlass was
exactly of prepossessing appearance. For a boy of fourteen he was
distinctly too fat. His round, fat face was flabby and, indeed, the
lower part of his face even gave the appearance of having double
chins. His expression was taciturn, with a shy reserve of
maliciousness.</p>

<p>"You're just in time for lunch," added Mrs. Bindloss, who was
avid to begin the lavish entertaining. "I expect you're ready for
your lunch after your journey."</p>

<p>Archie mumbled something about being "able to peck a bit," and
the three walked out of the station and got into the dog-cart.</p>

<p>When they were seated, Mrs. Bindloss broke out:</p>

<p>"Now, my dear Archie, I have a most dreadful confession to make.
I don't know what you'll think, considering what
you&mdash;er&mdash;are used to. But the whole of our domestic
service has broken down. I don't know whatever kind of lunch we
shall be able to provide. I do hope you won't mind taking pot-luck.
Our cook is ill in bed, and we're in <i>such</i> a muddle."</p>

<p>They couldn't hear what the boy replied, owing to the rattle of
the wheels and the noise of the town. Mrs. Bindloss continued:</p>

<p>"And how is your dear mother?"</p>

<p>"She's all right."</p>

<p>"Such a charming woman, <i>so</i> handsome, so
intellectual!"</p>

<p>The rest of the conversation on the way to the house, consisted
of a wild babble of effusive comment from Mrs. Bindloss, a certain
amount of forced hilarity from Mr. Bindloss, checked by almost
inaudible monosyllables from the boy.</p>

<p>"He's very shy," Mrs. Bindloss whispered to her husband as they
descended from the dog-cart. Gwendoline was on the lawn.</p>

<p>Mrs. Bindloss called out:</p>

<p>"Ah, here we are, dear! This is my eldest girl, Gwendoline. I
hope you'll be great friends. Where is Mildred? Reading, I expect.
Both my girls are great readers. Are you fond of reading,
Archie?"</p>

<p>He was understood to say either "yes" or "no."</p>

<p>It was then Mr. Bindloss's turn to have something to say.</p>

<p>"Hullo, I see you've brought fishing-rods. I'm afraid we haven't
any fishing here."</p>

<p>"Haven't you?" said Archie quite distinctly.</p>

<p>They entered the hall, and he put down his rods, and his brown
paper parcel, and took a stone bottle of ginger beer out of his
pocket and laid beside it.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! boys will be <i>pueri</i>," said Mr. Bindloss, who
was preparing for his Latin campaign. "He's brought a bottle of
ginger-beer, and I do believe&mdash;this parcel&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Really, Julian, Archie's parcel is no business of yours."</p>

<p>"They're sandwiches," said the visitor. This rather surprising
statement was robbed of further comment by Mildred's entrance,
rubbing her hands on her apron, which she had forgotten to remove.
She had been dishing up the vegetables.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Mrs. Bindloss, "here's our younger pride,
Mildred. Mildred, dear, what are you wearing that apron for. Have
you been working at your plants in the conservatory?"</p>

<p>"No, mother, I&mdash;er&mdash;" she held out her hand to Archie
and said timidly: "How are you?"</p>

<p>"Pretty dicky," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"What!" exclaimed Mr. Bindloss. "Pretty dicky! but my dear boy,
why didn't you tell me? What can we do? Is there anything you'd
like? A little sal volatile, perhaps. How do you feel?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," he answered.</p>

<p>"But this is most distressing. Do you feel like having any
lunch?"</p>

<p>"I expect I could peck a bit."</p>

<p>There is no denying that the future Lord Windlass had not made a
very auspicious start. He was plain, surly; he arrived with
fishing-rods, sandwiches and ginger beer&mdash;whatever kind of
people did his mother think they were?&mdash;and on the top of this
he announced that he felt "dicky."</p>

<p>"Come on, then, Julian, take Archie upstairs. Perhaps he would
like a wash. He may feel better after lunch."</p>

<p>While he was upstairs the lunch was whipped on to the table. It
must be acknowledged that for an invalid Archie "pecked" remarkably
well. He had two wings of chicken, a large slice of breast, the
parson's nose, two sausages, a liberal helping of sprouts and
potatoes, some coffee jelly, three mince pies, a banana, an apple
and some nuts, and chocolates. Apart from eating his enthusiasms
appeared dormant. They could get him to talk about nothing at all.
Mrs. Bindloss talked about the Royal family, the weather, politics,
her two daughter's cleverness&mdash;she didn't mention that it was
Mildred who had smitched the Brussels sprouts&mdash;the church, and
the lower classes. Mr. Bindloss talked about Headingley College,
the decay of society, and the beauties of plant life. Gwendoline
recounted a beautiful romance she had just been reading called,
<i>The Mother Superior</i>. Mildred stared at the future lord
open-mouthed, too nervous and agitated to eat or speak. The young
gentleman himself remained stubbornly monosyllabic. He only
ventured two remarks during the meal. Once he cocked his head on
one side and said:</p>

<p>"That picture's out of the straight."</p>

<p>And towards the end of the meal he said to Mildred:</p>

<p>"Do you hunt?"</p>

<p>On receiving an answer in the negative, he relapsed into a
settled gloom.</p>

<p>Once Mrs. Bindloss said: "After lunch we thought you dear
children might have a nice game of croquet. Dojyou play croquet,
Archie?"</p>

<p>"No," he said, "I hate croquet."</p>

<p>This was distinctly discouraging in view of the time and expense
that had been devoted in preparing this innocuous game. However,
concessions have to be made to the eccentricities of a future lord.
By an elaborate process Mr. Bindloss led up to the value of doing
things promptly, and came out proudly with:</p>

<p>"As you know, Archie, '<i>corripe tempus quod adest, O juvenes,
ne hori moriemini.</i>'"</p>

<p>Anyone who happened to know the trouble that Mr. Bindloss had
had to memorize this old tag would sympathize with him in his
disappointment when he regarded the face of his guest. It expressed
an uncomfortable disgust. Neither did he display any excitement
over the girl's drawings of flowers and fauna.</p>

<p>After lunch, however, he appeared in a better humour. On his own
responsibility he suggested a game with the girls which he called
"Yoics." It had to be played in a room, so they repaired to the
drawing-room. The game was this. Each of the three players had to
occupy a wall, touching it with their hands. Then the one facing
the blank wall had to call out: "Yoics! I'm going over." Then he or
she had to throw themselves on the ground and scramble on all fours
to the opposite wall before the other two&mdash;also on all
fours&mdash;met in the middle and touched hands. If he or she
failed to get there, then they all changed walls and someone else
tried.</p>

<p>It was not a game that Mrs. Bindloss would have recommended
because for one thing it meant re-arranging the furniture,
furthermore, it did no good to the girls' new taffeta frocks.
Nevertheless, she and her husband looked on and gave the impression
of being greatly amused. They kept the game up for about twenty
minutes, until in an excess of anxiety to reach the opposite wall,
Archie barged into the mahogany side table and knocked it over,
smashing the vase which dear Aunt Emily had given as a wedding
present, and spilling the flowers and water all over Gwendoline's
frock. Gwendoline had to go and change, and Mr. Bindloss suggested
that as it was such a fine day they might play some game in the
garden.</p>

<p>Archie was now getting more at home with the girls, and his
greater intimacy was principally demonstrated by pushing them
about. He had quite a pleasant wrestle with Mildred while Gwen was
changing her frock. He guaranteed to throw her three times in five
minutes, pinioning her head to the ground, and he did so quite
successfully. He was less successful with Gwen, as he only threw
her twice in ten minutes, and then at the expense of tearing her
skirt.</p>

<p>"It's a pity you don't play croquet, Archie," said Mrs.
Bindloss. "It's a most interesting game."</p>

<p>"No, I hate it. I'll tell you what we will do though. Let's play
croquet polo. You know, you have a goal at each end of the lawn,
and you try and score goals."</p>

<p>This sounded a harmless enough game, and they played Archie and
Mildred versus Mr. Bindloss and Gwen. They started gently tapping
the wooden ball across, but no goals being forthcoming, Archie
began to hit harder, and suddenly there was a yell. Mr. Bindloss
had received a fierce blow on the ankle from Archie's drive. He
limped off the field, and the girls protested that the game was too
rough and dangerous.</p>

<p>"All right," said Archie, "but I bet I'll drive a croquet ball
further than you two girls put together."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Bindloss retired to the security of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p>"He's a very curious boy," said Mr. Bindloss, rubbing his
ankle.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he's really very nice. I expect he improves on
acquaintance," replied his wife.</p>

<p>There was a sudden terrific crash and they rushed to the window.
Archie had driven his ball right through the glass of the
tomato-house.</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" Mr. Bindloss called out feebly.</p>

<p>It required great tact to dissuade the young gentleman from
continuing this game, without being definitely rude to him. It was
not till he had trampled on a bed of lupins, broken a croquet
mallet, and nearly knocked Mildred's eye out, that they were able
to get him to turn his attention to something else.</p>

<p>The nerves of Mr. Bindloss were getting on edge. He was
accustomed to an afternoon nap, but of course, such a thing was out
of the question on a day like this. He was inclined to be querulous
with his wife, an attitude which was hotly resented.</p>

<p>"You never think of the girls' interests," she said.</p>

<p>"Interests!" exclaimed Mr. Bindloss. "A nice sort of son-in-law
he'd make. I wish he'd go."</p>

<p>"He's getting on very well," said Mrs. Bindloss, looking out of
the window. "I'm sure he's enjoying himself." Then she added
breathlessly, "Julian, would you believe it! He's&mdash;kissing
Gwen in the tomato house!"</p>

<p>"Kissing!"</p>

<p>"Yes, he's got his arm round her waist."</p>

<p>"Well, I&mdash;really&mdash;I&mdash;what ought we to do?"</p>

<p>"Leave them alone. They are only children. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>She turned from the window and took up some knitting. There was
silence from the garden for nearly twenty minutes. Then Mildred
came running in.</p>

<p>"I say, mother, Archie says he feels sick," she exclaimed
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Sick!" exclaimed Mrs. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"Sick!" echoed Mr. Bindloss,</p>

<p>"Yes, he looks it too."</p>

<p>"Oh dear, oh dear!" exclaimed both the parents. They hurried out
into the garden. There was Archie sitting on the grass fanning
himself. He certainly looked very queer.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Archie," exclaimed Mrs. Bindloss, "Im so sorry.
Won't you come in? Let me get you something. Hadn't you better lie
down?"</p>

<p>He said, "Yes," and they led him in. He looked so ill that they
took him up to Mr. Bindloss's bedroom and got him to lie down on
the bed.</p>

<p>"Gwen," said Mrs. Bindloss, "run down the road and see if Dr.'
Burns is in. I'm sure Archie's mother would like us to have a
doctor to him."</p>

<p>They gave him a little soda water and left him. Gwen went for
the doctor. And while she was gone a most surprising thing
happened. A telegram arrived addressed to "Bindloss." Mrs. Bindloss
naturally opened it, and having opened it, gave a gasp of
astonishment. She handed the telegram to her husband. It ran as
follows.</p>

<p>"Archie has mumps regret could not send him. Northallerton."</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloss repeated the word "mumps" three times, and stared
helplessly at his wife.</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" said Mrs. Bindloss savagely, as though
accusing her husband of some wicked treachery.</p>

<p>"How can they say they couldn't send him when he's upstairs all
the time lying on my bed?" said Mr. Bindloss, as though he had made
a brilliant riposte.</p>

<p>"He must have escaped," interjected Mildred.</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloss was feverishly biting his nails. Suddenly he
waggled his first finger at his wife.</p>

<p>"Does anything strike you? Does anything strike you?" he
said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"He's got mumps. That's what the matter is with him. When he
arrived I thought he had double chins. But he's got mumps."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bindloss gasped.</p>

<p>"He's got mumps, and he's been kissing the girls, and now he's
lying on my bed."</p>

<p>"It's an outrage," screamed Mrs. Bindloss, "What are we to
do?"</p>

<p>"The only thing we can do is to wait for the doctor and then
telegraph to Mrs. Northallerton."</p>

<p>Gwendoline happened to catch the doctor starting on his rounds.
He came in and he and the two parents went up to the bedroom. The
doctor examined the boy.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "he's got mumps all right. He must remain here
and not be moved."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Archie," said Mrs. Bindloss, "what a pity you
didn't tell us! But look here, my dear, here's a most curious
letter from your mother, read it."</p>

<p>Archie was sorry for himself and surly. He read the telegram and
said:</p>

<p>"That's not from my mother."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?"</p>

<p>"My mother's name is Bloggs."</p>

<p>"What!" yelled Mr. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"What!" screamed Mrs. Bindloss.</p>

<p>"You never asked me my name. I was going out to do a bit of
fishing and you asked me home to lunch. That's all."</p>

<p>"But we called you Archie."</p>

<p>"My name is Archie, Archie Bloggs."</p>

<p>"But the maroon and black cap!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, I go to Headingley. I know young Northallerton,
awful little ass. There was an epidemic of mumps just as the school
broke up."</p>

<p>"But who the devil!" exclaimed Mr. Bindloss. "I mean who is your
father?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? Blogg's Sausages."</p>

<p>Mrs. Bindloss was nearly in tears.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say we've taken all this trouble and your father
is only a sausage&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Bindloss saw red.</p>

<p>"It's an outrage!" he yelled. "I shall prosecute you. You come
here and get a good meal on false pretences. You smash up the
drawing-room. You smash the greenhouse and the croquet mallet. You
nearly break my leg. And on the top of it you go kissing the girls
with mumps on you, and all the time you're not&mdash;you're not who
you're supposed to be. You're only the son of a sausage&mdash;By
God! I'll have you locked up."</p>

<p>The doctor intervened.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Bindloss, as I'm here in a
professional capacity I must ask you to keep the patient quiet. And
he should not be moved from this room."</p>

<p>"We won't have him here."</p>

<p>"Well, that's not my business. I've given you my advice." And
the doctor went.</p>

<p>There are many people in Tibbelsford who consider that Mr. and
Mrs. Bindloss behaved heartlessly in this matter. It is a point of
controversy to this day. The visit from an indignant Mr. Samuel
Bloggs, the father, did not help perhaps to pour oil on the
troubled waters. There was certainly an acrimonious argument, and
various cross threats of legal proceedings, but in the end the boy
was sent home in an ambulance. The critics of the parents'
behaviour did not of course know the inner history of their
spiritual duress. People are apt to underestimate what parents will
suffer for their children's interests, what indignities they will
submit to. The girls fortunately did not get mumps, and two days
later Mrs. Bindloss wrote to Mrs. Northallerton.</p>

<p class="letter">Dear Mrs. Northallerton,<br>
<br>
We were so grieved to hear about dear Archie. I do hope he is
making a good recovery. We waited lunch nearly three quarters of an
hour for him. I hope before the holidays are over he will be well
enough to come over for the day, and that you will be able to
accompany him. It was so sweet of you to have tried to arrange it,
and to have sent us the telegram. My husband joins me in sending
our very best greetings, and hopes for Archie's speedy
recovery.<br>
<br>
Believe me, dear Mrs. Northallerton,<br>
Yours very sincerely,<br>
Cora Bindloss.</p>

<p>That is the kind of woman Mrs. Bindloss is. And that is the kind
of spirit that has built cities, founded colonies and enlarged
empires.</p>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. WHEN THE EARTH STOPPED</h2>

<p>You may remember that the summer of 1938 was an exceptionally
hot one. Anti-cyclones over the eastern Atlantic caused a series of
heat waves in northern and western Europe. These conditions began
in early June, and they prevailed with only the briefest
interruptions right up to the third week in September. People had
never known such a hot summer.</p>

<p>One afternoon during the beginning of the first heat wave in
June, Lena Trevanna peeped beneath the sunblind and looked down on
to the marble terrace of her husbands palatial mansion at
Twickenham. The white marble seemed to be dancing and quivering in
the sun. Projecting from beneath the awning of an extending deck
chair she could see her husband's white buckskin boots, and the
sight filled her with bitterness. One might ask whether her
husband's boots were a special source of irritation to Lena. It is
difficult to say. Certainly, the right boot had once kicked her
during a paroxysm of the owner's anger. But it is doubtful whether
she hated his feet more than any of the rest of him. She had no
desire to see his face at that moment. She was all too familiar
with that heavy, puffy jowl, the bald head fringed with white hair,
the moist protruding eyes, the bristly tooth-brush moustache, the
overhanging eyelids, and the small dark eyes that missed nothing
and flashed alternately with anger and cunning.</p>

<p>She hated him, and she hated that miniature city, the roofs of
which she could just see on the other side of the park. They called
it Trevanna City. It comprised several square miles of studios,
workshops, and buildings of plaster and canvas, film factories, and
solid houses where lived actors and producers, and operators, and
all the rag-tag and bob-tail of that profession she had learned to
hate.</p>

<p>And Lena had not always hated it. When a very young girl it had
been the ambition of her life to be a filmstar. She had studied and
struggled and failed. She knew she was not beautiful. She was short
and dark and ill-proportioned. But she had something&mdash;she
believed she had the ability to portray emotion. For three years
she had withstood the buffets of the cinema world. No one gave her
the least encouragement. She became despondent and bitter. And then
one day she had met the great Julius Trevanna. Even at that
time&mdash;fifteen years ago&mdash;he was a big man in the film
world. And now?&mdash;was it not a notorious fact that he was the
central pivot of a virtual combine, the combine of all British and
Colonial film interests? Millions: millions; he had piled them up
as other men pile up shillings. And the millions brought no
satisfaction to Lena. She was nominally the mistress of the house.
In effect she was less than a servant. She was a servant without
the power to give notice. She was a slave, a chattle. She wandered
through the great corridors and galleries, and was
alone&mdash;utterly alone.</p>

<p>Some strange, almost perverse desire must have assailed Julius
when they first met. She was conscious of him observing her
sleepily and tugging at his little moustache as though considering
a problem. She disliked him instantly. He was physically repellent
to her. And then one day he had come and stroked her hair and
said:</p>

<p>"You're a nice little girl, eh?"</p>

<p>She did not know what to do. There suddenly flashed through her
mind two visions. One of Lena Baynes&mdash;unsuccessful, unknown,
penniless, getting old. The other of Lena Trevanna, rich,
successful, the greatest film star in the world. If she married him
he would be bound to give her leading parts. She had hesitated and
dallied. Julius was a masterful man. He had not given her
opportunities for long consideration. Money was no object in any of
his undertakings. And so one April day she found herself his wife.
For a few months there was a semblance of some kind of happiness in
their married life, and then came the rift. She almost at once
discovered that he was vicious, egotistical, and tyrannical. He
tired of her, but he would not let her go. When she suggested
herself in leading parts, he said:</p>

<p>"'Um, yes. Well, we shall see. Better begin at the bottom and
climb."</p>

<p>He gave her small parts and quickly showed he thought nothing of
her ability. One day she overheard him tell a producer that he
needn't bother about her because "she was a perfect fool." That was
the beginning. They quarrelled, and henceforth their lives were
lived apart. They shared the great palace and hardly ever exchanged
a word. He clothed her and fed her, but only made her a small
allowance. He ordered her about and bullied her. Sometimes he even
struck her. For fifteen years she had endured this life, hesitating
between numerous alternatives. What could she do? If she left him,
she would again have to face the struggle and the disgrace. She had
become quite convinced at last that she really had no ability as an
actress. And she was getting older. No wonder she began to hate
this unreal world. Everything was unreal and unconvincing.
Emotions, murders, and marriages and robberies were always being
enacted right under her nose. The house itself was frequently in
use, and she arrived at the condition of being unable to
differentiate between reality and posture. Every vision might be a
chimaera. The wljole countryside was unreal&mdash;film mad.</p>

<p>On this afternoon as she gazed on to the terrace, she sighed for
the days of her youth, when everything was vital and real. The sun
was apparently too hot for Julius. She saw him pull his hat over
his eyes and stroll into the house. At the same time she observed a
large aeroplane gliding downwards beyond the trees. After hovering
for a few seconds, it alighted on the landing stage across the
park. A small detachable motor-car appeared to be released from the
framework and in a few minutes was racing up the drive towards the
house.</p>

<p>"It's someone coming to see Julius," she thought.</p>

<p>In her enervated and bored mood she felt a sudden desire to see
who this stranger might be. Anything was better than eating her
heart out. She found her husband in the Louis XV. salon, still
smoking the cigar and glancing at a tape machine. She did not
address him. She went and perched herself in the window-seat.
Apparently he did not observe her. She pretended to be reading. In
a few minutes' time a butler entered with a card on a lacquer tray.
He handed it to Julius, who examined it.</p>

<p>"Good God!"</p>

<p>The importance of the message appeared to be so profound that he
swung round as though he could not restrain his excitement. He must
communicate it to someone. He observed Lena and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mark Ulrich! Good God! Mark Ulrich himself! The biggest man in
the film world of the whole of America! What the devil does
he&mdash;"</p>

<p>Apparently feeling that he was being too familiar and
communicative, he turned once more to the butler and said:</p>

<p>"Show Mr. Ulrich in."</p>

<p>The room was flooded with a mellow light diffused by the skilful
arrangement of sunblinds. She lay shivering in her corner,
watchfully alert. The butler retired and re-entered, followed by
the visitor. There was little about the first impression of Mr.
Mark Ulrich to denote the biggest man in the cinema world. His
physique was insignificant, his face was grey and drawn, his
clothes dowdy. It was only when he advanced and held out his hands
that she observed the quiet power behind the eyes, the steady jaw,
the complete sense of assurance which only masterful men
possess.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trevanna?" he muttered, and smiled kindly.</p>

<p>Julius was obviously deeply affected, excited and a shade
suspicious. What had the American Film King come to him for? He
spoke as casually as he could:</p>

<p>"I'm very pleased to meet you, Mr. Ulrich&mdash;a great honour.
Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>The American perched himself on the corner of a Chesterfield,
and passed his hand over his brow.</p>

<p>"I have been most anxious to meet you, Mr. Trevanna. I am a bad
traveller. I preferred the old days when we used to come by sea.
Even now I insist upon the dirigible. They are slow but
comfortable. I must have my bath. It is two and a half days since I
left my home in Connecticut to come and visit you."</p>

<p>Julius raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you have come over specially to see
me?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich smiled.</p>

<p>"Why not? Yes, indeed. I have a matter I want to discuss with
you, if you can spare me the time."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, I have nothing urgent this afternoon or
to-night. May I put you up for a day or two?"</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you. I must return to America to-night,
however. But if you think well of my idea I shall return again in a
few days' time."</p>

<p>"Well, well, now. Make yourself at home. Have a cigar."</p>

<p>"Thank you, I do not smoke. If you can really spare me the time,
I will begin to lay my plans before you at once."</p>

<p>He coughed and looked round the room, and his eye alighted on
Lena. He gave a little exclamation of surprise.</p>

<p>Julius, who had quite forgotten her, turned in her direction. He
barked out:</p>

<p>"My wife!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich immediately walked across the room and held out his
hand to her.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Trevanna," he said, "I am delighted to make your
acquaintance."</p>

<p>The unaccustomed social attention quite unnerved Lena. She could
only gasp: "Thank you...Thank you."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich looked slightly puzzled. He glanced from one to the
other and then resumed his seat. Julius appeared to hesitate
whether to order his wife out of the room, but apparently decided
that her presence made no difference one way or the other. The only
sound was the ticking of the tape machine. Mr. Ulrich leant forward
on his knees, and as he spoke a tinge of colour enlivened his
countenance:</p>

<p>"What I am about to propose to you may cause you considerable
surprise, and I shall not ask you to come to any decision in the
matter till my return from America. The idea has come to me slowly.
It is the outcome of the growth of my experience&mdash;many, many
long years in the film world. I think it began to take shape at the
time when the Chinese, and indeed all the Eastern people, began to
be absorbed by the fascination of moving picture work. Now, as you
know, Mr. Trevanna, the cinema industry is the first industry in
the world. It represents a larger flotation of capital, it employs
more people, and pays greater dividends than any other two
industries in the world put together. You and I, and perhaps a few
others, hardly realise the power that is in our hands."</p>

<p>Julius looked up at him quickly.</p>

<p>"Is your idea&mdash;an international combine?"</p>

<p>"In a sense&mdash;yes. But my idea is more comprehensive than
that. I am of opinion that what the famous League of Nations failed
to accomplish, the Universal Film Trust could accomplish quite
easily."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't see&mdash;the League of Nations! What have
we to do with politics?"</p>

<p>"We might have everything to do with politics. If we could live
up to the ideal which should inspire all parties to the agreement,
we could&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What could we do?"</p>

<p>"We could stop the earth!"</p>

<p>"What the devil!"</p>

<p>"I do not mean that human life or activities would be stopped.
On the contrary, they would be helped, and encouraged, and
elevated. What I mean is that history could be stopped. There would
be armies, but they would be armies in fustian. We could fight
again the battle of the Marne, the battle of Poitiers, the battle
of Marathon, but there would never again be bloodshed. There would
be nations retaining their national characteristics but as nations
they would have no claws or talons. There would be Governments, but
they would be tools in our hands. We should enter the age of
retrospection. We would wind up the history of the world. We would
set it down, and reproduce it on the screens. All men would work
simply and reverently for the good of mankind. Agriculture and
manufacture and all arts and industries would still go on, of
course, but there would be no international politics. With the
power that we represent we could check any movement of political
aggression. We could stop the production of all armaments except
those made of wood and canvas."</p>

<p>"You must be mad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich smiled gently, and raised his hand.</p>

<p>"Mr. Trevanna," he continued, "I need perhaps hardly point out
to you that my life and work have not all been the outcome of a
visionary existence. Many people consider me a hard, material man.
Even my numerous benefactions have been ascribed as 'good
business.' I may mention that, in spite of your unique position in
the British film world, you are not the first man I have
approached. I only crave your sympathetic consideration. As I say,
I do not expect you to give your decision until I return from
America."</p>

<p>Julius sucked the stump of his cigar, which had gone out.</p>

<p>"Might I ask&mdash;who else have you approached?"</p>

<p>"Ah Sing Fu."</p>

<p>"Ah Sing Fu!"</p>

<p>Lena observed her husband start and shrink back into the easy
chair. Mr. Ulrich twisted his fingers around his bony knees and
swayed backward and forwards.</p>

<p>"The world has yet to comprehend the Chinese. The Chinese are
the most numerous, the most intelligent, the most immovable race on
this earth. It may almost be said that they wound up their history
some time ago. They have begun to find out how to live. I have
spent many happy hours in the society of Ah Sing Fu. He is a
philosopher, an idealist, and an extremely able and practical man.
As you know, he is the presiding genius of that wonderful group of
Eastern film activities which have only come into force during the
last fifteen years. It embraces the whole of China and Eastern
Siberia and part of Japan. It has its ramifications throughout
India and the Malay Archipelago. It is a bigger corporation than
either yours or ours. Ah Sing Fu and I are the only people at
present who have discussed this idea. I now come to you. Within the
course of a few weeks trusted agents of ours will be active
throughout Europe and Africa and that part of Asia not yet
influenced by Ah Sing Fu."</p>

<p>"But what does it all amount to? How do you propose to go to
work?"</p>

<p>"The nations of the world, Mr. Trevanna, are still living on
paper credit as a result of the great war. They are, indeed, a lot
of bankrupts. They can dress well and dine well and stuff the bills
away into a drawer. They are just gambling on. Their very existence
depends on the goodwill and good sense of men controlling the
largest blocks of actual assets. We film industries are conducted
on a cash basis. We represent the biggest, solidest control of
capital in the world. Nothing can stand against it!"</p>

<p>"Then we could shove the prices up."</p>

<p>"We could, but that is not the idea of either Ah Sing Fu or
myself. Our idea is simply a moral one. On the contrary, we think
the charges should be reduced, the standard of production raised;
the ego could be turned inwards to absorb the moral of the past
and, through it, to determine the way to live."</p>

<p>The eyes of Julius were starting out of his head. He was
obviously convinced that he was in the presence of a lunatic, a
dangerous lunatic, and yet a person for whom he had a profound
respect. He had chafed his fingers once badly pulling the strings
against this very man. And Ah Sing Fu was a genius; the whole film
world acclaimed it.</p>

<p>He was uncomfortable and disturbed, and suspicious. Why couldn't
they leave him alone comfortably piling up his millions. Who cared
or believed in the "uplifting of humanity?" At the same time, if he
opposed them, what might they not do? His fortune was great, but
his commitments were greater. He depended on America, and Russia,
and even the East for many things. Unless he was circumspect, he
might find himself marooned. He temporised.</p>

<p>"It's a big idea."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich blinked at the great salon and cracked a knuckle.
Then he arose and walked to the window, and looked across the park.
He appeared to be considering some new problem. Suddenly he turned
and said quietly:</p>

<p>"This is a very beautiful house. Very quiet and charming. It has
suddenly occurred to me&mdash;Ah Sing Fu and I had almost
determined to call a conference at Joachims in Prague at the end of
the month, but when I come to think of it&mdash;I wonder whether we
could trespass upon your hospitality! This would make an ideal
meeting place. And it would be more convenient in many ways. You
live here alone, do you not? Of course, it all depends upon the
word of Mrs. Trevanna..."</p>

<p>He smiled and bowed to her. Julius grunted and tugged at his
little moustache. Lena did not speak. The shafts of unspoken venom
passing between husband and wife must have been apparent to Mr.
Ulrich, but he gave no recognition of it. Julius suddenly
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, certainly. Have it here, by all means."</p>

<p>But it was said less as a genial invitation than as an assertion
that the word of Mrs. Trevanna didn't count one way or the
other.</p>

<p>"Very kind, very kind of you indeed," murmured Mr. Ulrich. "As
you may imagine, there will be a great number of technicalities to
discuss. It will be necessary to get in everyone, and possibly
to&mdash;eradicate objectionable elements."</p>

<p>He uttered the last sentence very slowly and clearly. There was
a touch of velvet menace about it. Julius visualised Ah Sing Fu,
Ulrich and Joachim eradicating "objectionable elements." Joachim,
he knew, was another of these international fanatics who were
becoming so prolific. The centre of his operations was Prague, and
he controlled the film interests of all Central Europe. These three
together could eradicate anything. They were mad&mdash;stark,
staring mad; but they frightened him. Fortunately there was his
friend, Jonkers, in Brussels. He was a good man, a good, solid man,
with no nonsense about him. He would ring up Jonkers, and see what
he thought. Between them perhaps they could cope with these
lunatics, these visionaries. Damn it! what was his wife doing,
suddenly walking over to this American and shaking hands, saying
she would like to have the conference here? In his house! He, who
by his industry and genius, had built the place, and picked her out
of the gutter. He had half a mind to cancel the whole thing. He was
being rushed...</p>

<p>"Then that is settled, Mr. Trevanna. I do not mean that you will
agree at present to join the combination, but that you will agree
that we hold the conference here. It is so much more satisfactory
than any written or wirelessed way of communicating. It is
necessary that we should all know each other. The personal factor
still remains the dominant force in the world."</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich held out his hand, and Julius found himself gripping
it. The vanity of wealth over-rode his other feelings. He desired
to impress his rivals.</p>

<p>"Invite as many as you like," he exclaimed. "We could put up a
hundred or two and not notice them in this place."</p>

<p>"I do not think it will be necessary to ask more than about
twelve or fifteen&mdash;just a central body&mdash;but the
conference will naturally go on for several weeks. After
formulating a broadly-designed scheme, it will be necessary to keep
constantly in touch with our representatives in all parts of the
world. There will be opposition and misunderstanding, and we shall
have to clean it up bit by bit."</p>

<p>"I will stroll down the garden with you."</p>

<p>Julius felt a sudden accentuated aversion to his wife. He was
annoyed that she had been present. He felt that he was being made
to look weak and pliable, and it angered him that she should have
observed it. He scowled at her as he suggested the stroll in the
garden. It was meant to imply very forcibly that her presence was
undesirable. It was quite unnecessary, however. Lena made no
attempt to follow. She froze into her former conditionjof sullen
aloofness. Mr. Ulrich shook her hand, and the two men went into the
garden.</p>

<p>Lena watched them for some time talking earnestly beneath the
cedar tree. Ulrich did most of the talking. He was emphasising his
points deliberately and clearly, tapping the palm of his left hand
with two fingers of his right. In rather less than an hour's time,
he took his departure.</p>

<p>Julius came back into the house. He was in a very bad temper. He
kept snapping his fingers, a characteristic sign of extreme tension
and nervousness. When he saw her, he bawled at her:</p>

<p>"Make all preparations with the servants to entertain twenty men
here for three weeks in August."</p>

<p>She felt tempted to reply: "Don't you mean, 'make all
preparations with the <i>other</i> servants?'" but she forbore, and
shrank away from him. Alone in her room, she thought: "They are
going to stop the earth...everything will cease...everything will
be unreal for ever."</p>

<p>The unusual spell of heat continued. Three days later her
husband remarked to her in the morning:</p>

<p>"Jonkers is coming to-night. Have the Dubarry room prepared for
him."</p>

<p>She knew and detested this Jonkers. He was so very like her
husband, only not so fat. He had a disgusting, oleaginous,
over-familiar way of talking to her. He said one thing with his
mouth and another with his eyes. He was cunning, and supercilious,
and sensual. He sometimes flattered her, but she knew from his eyes
that he thought no more of her than her husband did. Nevertheless,
she was interested to hear of the visit. She knew that it was in
some way connected with the visit of Mr. Ulrich. All over the world
were springing up what her husband called "these crazy
internationalists." Ulrich, Ah Sing Fu, Joachim, and these others
were of that persuasion. They only awaited some lever. Jonkers and
Julius Trevanna would never agree with the rest. They would plot
behind the scenes. They would play for their own hands.</p>

<p>She knew that, and she knew it more fully when she saw them
together that night after dinner. She pretended to make herself
scarce, but she was watching and listening. Jonkers stayed two days
and nights, and the two friends talked far into the night. It was
very difficult. Julius was suspicious, and she had to appear more
dormant and preoccupied than ever. Only once did she manage to
overhear a portion of a conversation which completely showed the
trend of their ambitions.</p>

<p>"Of course, we shall have to agree," Julius was saying. "It's
too big a thing. But this is where we'll come in,
Jonkers&mdash;"</p>

<p>He explained some technical suggestion of Ulrich's. Lena could
not understand it, but she understood the chuckle of the Flemish
guest, when he interjected:</p>

<p>"Keep that dark, dear boy. You and I between us, we should make
four million a year clear profit over that&mdash;if we pretend,
see?"</p>

<p>Followed no relief from the prevailing high temperature. Jonkers
went and others came. Tapes and telephones and wires were always
active, and still the world was unsuspicious of being stopped. July
came and went and the day of the conference was drawing near.</p>

<p>Lena was pledged to secrecy. Not a word was to be breathed. The
affair was to have the appearance of an ordinary house party. The
servants would know nothing about the guests. If it came out that
all the film magnates were assembled at one point, the stock
markets of the world would be in panic.</p>

<p>Ah Sing Fu was the first arrival. He came with a retinue of
three servants and a secretary. He drifted into the house like an
autumn leaf indicating the wane of the year&mdash;an old man, with
a thin, white beard, suave, gentle, impenetrable. Lena would never
know him, but she felt that she could trust him.</p>

<p>"No man was ever so wise as some Chinamen look." Ah Sing Fu was
like that. There was something about him big, disinterested,
indestructible&mdash;a pioneer of perpetuity.</p>

<p>He and his retainers glided about the house in their slippered
feet. Their presence seemed permeating but intangible. Ulrich
followed within twelve hours. Then came Joachim, a jovial giant,
with a deep penetrating voice and a laugh that was good to hear.
Three others arrived in the night as if by magic. Rene Caradoc, a
Frenchman; Raddaes, a Portuguese; and an indeterminate person
called Linnsen, who might have been anything from a Moor to a
Chicago stock-raiser. They vanished to their rooms, met in the
morning, and talked in little groups over their coffee. The
conference was already begun. Golf was played in the afternoon,
obviously with the idea of giving an impression of normality.
Joachim broke a club, and his laugh could be heard across the park.
He had probably never played the game before. The afternoon brought
two gentlemen from South America and one from Cape Town. Lena was
beginning to lose the thread of their identities. Everything was
becoming dreamlike, fantastic. The heat was enervating. There was
an informal meeting of all parties in the library, and Julius
informed her that her presence was not desirable. Again in the
night arrived Moder, another American, and a Hindu, with a retinue
of five. Within the week the conference was complete. Twenty-three
sat round the circular table in the library. All the doors were
closed. Lena wandered about the grounds or sat in the garden
dreaming. What were they going to do? What would be the outcome of
it, this conspiracy to stop the earth? She liked Ulrich, and she
liked Joachim and Ah Sing Fu. They were good men. She was convinced
of that. But&mdash;this heat! She dreaded it, the stopping of the
earth, retrospection, going back, nothing happening again,
everything to be filmed and unreal. She would not be able to stand
it.</p>

<p>While things went on there always seemed a vestige of
hope...anything might happen. But if they were
successful&mdash;</p>

<p>She met them on the terrace and at meal times, pleasant,
charming men for the most part. They were very kind to her, very
considerate, but pre-occupied. Big things were on the move. Code
messages arrived and were despatched all day and night. The weeks
dragged by. She overheard occasional remarks which gave her an
inkling of development. There appeared to be trouble in South
Russia and the Balkans. There would be, of course. Joachim and
Ulrich were very active over this. Someone was being squeezed out.
The operation appeared to be conducted through a process of buying
and selling stock on the Vienna stock exchange. It was all quite
incomprehensible.</p>

<p>At the end of the third week two more men appeared; one a
German, the other an Albanian. They were initiated into the
mysteries. Once she heard one of them remark: "The Dutch are
obstinate." She knew they would be. Her heart went out to the
Dutch. Then the crushing process began on Amsterdam. Someone else
was superseded. It seemed horrible. The whole earth was being
cleaned up. And all the time Julius Trevanna and Jonkers were
playing some game of their own. Before the others, they did not
appear very intimate, but Lena knew that Julius invariably visited
Jonkers in his room at night after the others had retired. There
was a private telephone and wireless service there. One night she
tried to listen at the keyhole. She could hear them talking, but
could not hear what they said. And suddenly the door opened and
Julius came out. He caught hold of her arm and hurt her.</p>

<p>"What the devil are you doing?" he muttered, and he flung her
across the passage.</p>

<p>That night she did not sleep.</p>

<p>The next day she sought out Ulrich. She managed to detach him
from a group on the terrace. She whispered:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ulrich, may I have a private word with you?"</p>

<p>"Why, certainly, dear lady."</p>

<p>"Will you come to the end of the second orchid house in ten
minutes' time?"</p>

<p>When he came she could not get her breath. She was terrified.
She felt sure Julius would know. If she betrayed him, he would kill
her. She said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Ulrich, forgive me. I am worried. I know you are
good&mdash;you are all good men. But this power you are
wielding&mdash;suppose one day this power should...get into the
hands of someone who is not good?"</p>

<p>Mr. Ulrich looked at her kindly, and patted her hand.</p>

<p>"My dear lady," he answered, "you are quite right. And we are
taking every precaution. As a matter of fact, the combination can
only exist while it is a moral force. You may be sure that
immediately it began to be abused humanity would turn and rend it.
Our ambition is to keep it dark for many years until its activities
have produced concrete results."</p>

<p>"You mean to say that the world won't know it has been
stopped?"</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is what I mean."</p>

<p>"But suppose&mdash;suppose someone <i>inside</i> abused it."</p>

<p>"There is a slight risk of that, of course. But he would have to
be wonderfully astute to deceive Ah Sing Fu and&mdash;some of the
others. Has anyone arrived at the conference whose character you
suspect?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"There, there, you must not distress yourself, Mrs. Trevanna.
Everything is going on splendidly. The meeting has exceeded my
wildest anticipations."</p>

<p>A messenger came seeking him. The conference was in session.
Lena ordered the car and told the chauffeur to drive fast. She
wanted air. The heat was getting unbearable. On her return the
party were again on the terrace. They seemed in very good spirits.
She heard Joachim say: "On Thursday, then, we will sign."</p>

<p>Ulrich replied: "Yes. If the reply from Brotzel is
satisfactory."</p>

<p>She moved among them, and with shy diffidence presided at the
silver tea urn. The men were all laughing and joking. Joachim
suddenly slapped his leg.</p>

<p>"I have it! I have it! I know what we must do," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"What is that?"</p>

<p>"We must film it."</p>

<p>"Film what?"</p>

<p>"Thursday. It must go down to posterity. The day when the
Conference was signed. All the incidents of the day. The members
signing&mdash;having tea, talking, enjoying the special delights of
Mrs. Trevanna's hospitality."</p>

<p>Ulrich nodded sagely.</p>

<p>"There would be no objection, I'm sure, provided that the films
were not released for many years."</p>

<p>"Naturally. What do you say, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>No one objected, although Ah Sing Fu seemed to consider it a
superfluous indignity. Rather trivial; nevertheless, he nodded
acquiescence. Jonkers smiled cynically.</p>

<p>"Yes, of course. Very good. You must be in this, too, Mrs.
Trevanna. Wife of British delegate ministering to her husband,
eh?"</p>

<p>The suggestion was greeted with shouts of approval. Lena frowned
and felt uncomfortable. What a mockery! And all these years she had
wanted to play&mdash;now, "the wife of British delegate ministering
to his wants." The future generations would never know. No one
would know except Jonkers, mocking and sneering behind his black
moustache. How unbearable! What could she do to stop it all?</p>

<p>On the Wednesday news came that Brotzel&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;had been won to the cause. The coast was clear. The next
day the Conference would sign and break up. The world would begin
to stop.</p>

<p>That night Lena slept for an hour, and then awoke with a start.
She rose and went to the window. She pressed her temples against
the pane. The heat was intolerable. She looked out into the park.
Nothing stirred. Everything was unnaturally still. The silence was
oppressive. "The world has stopped...the world has stopped," she
thought. "Nothing will ever happen again. There will be no more
love, no more romance&mdash;only make-believe. It will get hotter
and hotter. The sun will scorch it to a cinder, and the other side
will freeze. Everyone will die, and either burn up or freeze.
Nothing will matter. Nothing will have any value. It will all be as
though it had never existed. Perhaps it never did exist. Perhaps
it's just a dream&mdash;a film."</p>

<p>Suddenly burying her face in her hands, she muttered:</p>

<p>"Oh God! give me power to be real&mdash;just once."</p>

<p>The day dawned clear and hot. The terrace glittered with
sunlight and crisp shadows. An excellent day for "shooting." The
operators were already busy in the park. She could see Joachim
laughing and striking preposterous attitudes. Ah Sing Fu fanning
himself unconcernedly. A small party having breakfast on the
terrace. Ulrich talking quietly and authoritatively. Where was
Julius Trevanna? Ah! the inevitable cigar. He strolls&mdash;or
rather rolls&mdash;like a bloated elephant to the easy chair to put
his feet up, a newspaper tucked under his arm. A breakfast tray on
a table by his left side, the plates and knives dishevelled. He has
been for the paper. He looks irritable and bored. A fat band of
flesh bulges above his collar. His thick lips are sucking at the
cigar.</p>

<p>Down she goes. The sunlight blinds and dizzies her. She could
almost faint with that first step into the light. Nervousness, a
kind of stage-fright, perhaps. Very, very slowly, like a cat, she
creeps across the terrace. A little man by the top of the steps is
watching her, and she is pleased. Years and years go by before she
reaches the table, but it doesn't matter because the world has
stopped. Her actions become slower and slower, and more mechanical.
She takes ages to choose the knife in such a collection. The
butter-knife would be foolish&mdash;possibly ineffective. The
bread-knife? No, that sharp, busy little thing so useful for
cutting ham. Cutting ham! She laughs inaudibly, but Julius does not
stir. The aggressive line of fat above the collar entices her. She
is conscious of her face clean cut in profile, expressing a real
emotion that shall go down to posterity, of the deliberate grace of
her posture as she slowly raises her arm and&mdash;thrusts
downwards above the collar, and of the voice of the little man at
the top of the steps:</p>

<p>"That's right, Mrs. Trevanna, not too fast. Hold it!
Fine...fine...My God! what have you done!"...The first big part
Julius Trevanna had ever given her an opportunity to play.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. WILLIAM'S NARROW SQUEAK</h2>

<p>"Confound that Mrs. Buswell!"</p>

<p>Twenty minutes to nine, and she had not either called me or
brought my early cup of tea! During the four years in which I had
held the distinguished position of sub-manager to the Southrepps
Bank in Baker Street&mdash;the youngest sub-manager ever appointed
in the whole record of this famous Southrepps banking association,
sir&mdash;it had always been my proud boast that I had never been
one minute late in the morning, not one minute. Apart from the
eagerness and interest I flatter myself I have always taken in my
work, I consider it a valuable example to the junior clerks. I like
to be at my desk when they arrive, and to grade the quality of my
morning salutation to a precise scale of minutes. Sharp on time and
I say breezily: "Good morning, Mr. So-and-so!" Four minutes late:
"Morning." Five minutes late: a curt nod. Anything between five and
eight minutes: a black scowl. Anything beyond eight minutes: a
peremptory demand for explanation. Punctuality and precision have
always been the most pronounced of my characteristics. To these I
probably owe my success in life.</p>

<p>Now, I occupied a pleasant suite of rooms in a small house in
Motcombe Street. Mrs. Buswell was my landlady. I did my utmost to
inculcate into her the value and importance of these two strong
principles, and in a fair way I succeeded. On the whole I could not
complain of Mrs. Buswell. She knocked on my door every morning at
half-past eight, and set down a cup of tea. I would then rise,
drink the tea, shave, have a bath, dress, and enter my sitting-room
at ten minutes to nine. My breakfast was invariably ready.
Breakfast would occupy fifteen minutes. I would then smoke one
cigarette, glance at the newspaper, put on my boots, and leave the
house at nine-fifteen. I would walk along a quiet street parallel
to the Marylebone Road, and arrive at the bank about three minutes
before half-past nine. At half-past nine&mdash;I say&mdash;I would
be seated at my desk, pen in hand. Our manager, Mr. Woodward, did
not come till ten.</p>

<p>But recently Mrs. Buswell had developed a regrettable lapse. On
Monday she had been three minutes late. On Wednesday, four and a
half. On Thursday, so late that I had to go without marmalade, and
to take a 'bus along the Marylebone Road. I would rather go without
breakfast altogether than be late at the bank. And now on this
Friday morning she was again ten minutes late and there was no
sound of her. I rang the bell and waited, but there was no answer.
I went out on to the landing and called down: "Mrs. Buswell, are
you there?"</p>

<p>I could get no answer to this. The minutes were crowding by. I
was angry. I believe I swore. In any case I hastily donned a
dressing-gown and slippers and explored the basement. There was no
sign of Mrs. Buswell, and the fire was not lighted. Mystery of
mysteries! I went back and consulted my watch. Had it gone wrong?
Was I several hours fast? But no, I am a man peculiarly sensitive
to time. I knew by my sensations that it must be somewhere about
eight-forty-five. Without more ado I went upstairs and knocked on
Mrs. Buswell's bedroom door. Again there was no answer. I knocked
louder. A dread suspicion came to me. Perhaps she had died in the
night, or been murdered?</p>

<p>I boldly opened the door. Mrs. Buswell was not there. The bed
was sketchily made. I could not tell whether it had been slept in
or not. There was no one else in the house. It was all most
provoking. She must have gone out somewhere&mdash;perhaps to get
some bread or milk. Anyway, I could not afford to waste any more
time. I went back to my room, shaved in cold water, had a bath, and
dressed myself. By that time it was seven minutes past nine. Still
no sign of Mrs. Buswell. I went down into the kitchen. I just had
time to make myself a cup of tea, and then, by taking the
Marylebone Road 'bus, I could be at the bank at my usual time. I
filled the kettle, and struck a match to light the gas-stove, and
then I had my second shock. The gas was cut off.</p>

<p>"Now, that's a queer, mysterious thing!" I thought. I had a
cheerless breakfast of bread and butter and cold water. I would
<i>not</i> be late at the bank. I was just preparing to go when I
realized that my boots were not cleaned, and yesterday had been
muddy. I then really did swear at the defaulting landlady. To turn
up at the bank with yesterday's mud on one's boots is an even more
heinous offence than being five minutes late. I fetched my boots
and cleaned them.</p>

<p>In the end I had to run to the corner where the 'buses passed.
Of course, there was not one in sight! I waited several minutes,
fuming with impatience. No 'bus came, neither was there anyone
about.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the world?" I exclaimed, angrily. I
crossed the road and ran down the side street that led to Baker
Street. I ran nearly all the way. I did not pass a soul, but so
consumed was I with my special complexity I hardly noted the fact.
It is in any case a source of pride to me to be able to state that
when I entered the bank it was just one minute to the half-hour. I
was at my desk by half-past, pen in hand. We had at that time only
two junior clerks, Weaks and Burton. (Burton, indeed, was really
only an office boy.) Of course, they were both late. Burton had
been late on several occasions recently and I was in a bad temper.
I had had practically no breakfast in order to be in time, and I
prepared myself to put Master Burton in his place. Five-and-twenty
minutes to ten and neither had arrived. Twenty to, and a deadly
stillness pervaded the bank premises.</p>

<p>I became eerily conscious of a silence that I had never felt in
my life before. There was no sound of traffic outside at all!</p>

<p>"Perhaps there's been a strike," I thought. "And then, of
course, Weaks and Burton would both be unavoidably late."</p>

<p>But I didn't like it at all. I went out to the front door and
looked up and down Baker Street. There were no vehicles at all, no
people, no life of any sort!</p>

<p>An almost unrealizable horror gripped me. I looked up at
windows, peered into basements, and shouted at the top of my voice.
There was no answer, no response. The position was too staggering
to be grasped. Horrors, visions, black misgivings crept through me.
Prophetic utterances, and Biblical quotations.</p>

<p>"And one shall be taken and the other left!"</p>

<p>Had everyone been taken? and I the only other left? I am not an
hysterical man. I have always been sensible, orthodox, and
practical. I am a member of the Church of England, and an upholder
of the Throne and the Unionist party.</p>

<p>I said to myself, firmly: "William, get a grip on yourself!"</p>

<p><br>
I went back to my desk and waited. Perhaps Mr. Woodward would turn
up at ten. He was seldom late. It would be in any case an immense
relief to discuss the amazing phenomenon with someone. Ten o'clock
came, a quarter past, no Mr. Woodward. Then, indeed, I did become
slightly unbalanced. I had a sudden inspiration. The telephone! I
rushed to the instrument, lifted the receiver, and screamed into
it: "Hullo! Hullo! Hullo! Is anyone there?"</p>

<p>There was a pause, and then I distinctly heard a voice say,
weakly:</p>

<p>"Hullo, who is that?"</p>

<p>"It's I, William Mears, of the Southrepps Bank. Who are you, for
God's sake?"</p>

<p>I listened. There was no sound but the drone of the wires. I
waited, and called again and again. The low hum of the wires
continued. Then I thought to myself: "Nevertheless, the telephone
is working. If it is working, someone must be at the
power-station."</p>

<p>Where were the power-stations? I had distinctly heard that voice
at the other end&mdash;a man's.</p>

<p>I sat calmly at my desk, almost afraid to think. Eleven o'clock
came, eleven-fifteen, eleven-thirty. I hope you will place it to my
credit that between eleven-thirty and twelve I quietly continued my
office routine as though nothing were the matter. We were within a
week of our quarterly balances, and there was much to
do&mdash;especially with all the staff away.</p>

<p>Just before twelve, however, I thought to myself:</p>

<p>"What's the good of banking when there is no one to bank?"</p>

<p>I shut up the ledger, put on my hat, and went out, after
carefully locking everything up. The sun was shining, and the
roads, wet from yesterday's downpour, gaily reflected the blue and
white sky. In that strange hour it gave me a curious sense of
comfort to observe light cirrus clouds moving across the sky. Yes,
something was alive then.</p>

<p>I walked up Baker Street. The doors of some of the shops were
open, and I went in. There were neither shopkeepers nor customers.
I could have helped myself to things of untold value. At the corner
of Orchard Street was a newspaper placard. It said: "Latest from
Newmarket." There was no date on the paper. It seemed grimly ironic
to think of horse-racing when Oxford Street was entirely deserted.
There was Messrs. Harridge's vast emporium. One of the doors was
open and I went in. I walked through endless show-rooms, filled
with clothes, books, stationery, silver, plate, glass, all utterly
without value or interest to me. Then I came to a large provision
department, and my interest quickened. I remembered that I was
hungry. There were hundreds of hams, tongues, fowls, quails, and
all kinds of thing in jelly. Without any scruples I devoured two
jolly little quails in aspic and a fruit tart. The wine department
was packed with every conceivable wine, spirit, and liqueur, but I
am a temperate man, and these things did not tempt me. It was,
moreover, very necessary to keep a clear head. I left Messrs.
Harridge's and went farther on down Oxford Street, I was passing
the premises of a rival bank, and I went in. It was all open;
moreover, the safe was unlocked. I could have helped myself to a
bag or two of golden sovereigns and a sack of Treasury notes, but
what is the use of five thousand pounds when you cannot even buy
the sound of a human voice?</p>

<p>Just before reaching Regent Street I had a most emotional
experience. On the roof of a hosier's shop I espied a black cat. It
was mewing piteously. Now, I have never been very fond of cats, but
I suddenly felt an overwhelming desire for the company of this
black friend. I ran into the shop and up the stairs. With great
difficulty I managed to get on to the roof. The cat had
disappeared. What became of it I never knew. I felt terribly
affected by losing this cat. I said to myself:</p>

<p>"William, you are becoming mawkish. You <i>must</i> pull
yourself together."</p>

<p>In Regent Street a cheering sight met my gaze&mdash;a florist's
shop. I hurried in. There were masses of cut roses, lilac,
carnations, and violets. There were plants and dwarf trees in pots.
I examined them all carefully. The cut flowers were in water, the
plants were growing. The general scheme of things began to take
shape in my mind. The world was alive, the sun was in the heavens,
the clouds and the good air were just as usual. There was life
going on of some sort&mdash;flowers, a black cat, a voice on the
telephone. It appeared to be just human life conspicuous by its
absence. I gathered together a large bunch of dark red roses. I
buried my face in them, and clung to them as the only connecting
link with the things that mattered. I took them with me on my
further pilgrimage down West.</p>

<p>Piccadilly Circus was like a neglected dust-heap. Refuse was
scattered here and there. Near the Tube station were holes in the
wooden pavement, as though someone had started to dig it up and
then gone away. I wandered down the Haymarket, across Trafalgar
Square, past Charing Cross, and then to the Embankment. The dear
old river looked just the same as usual, except that there was no
sign of seagulls or pigeons. The little waves were lapping against
the piers of the bridge. The river in any case was another live
thing. It was crowded with barges, lighters, and small merchantmen,
all idle and deserted. I sought avidly for any sign of smoke. There
was none.</p>

<p>I went along the Embankment as far as Westminster, then turned
back past the House of Commons and along to the Green Park. The
Green Park soothed me. It <i>was</i> green, and the trees and
bushes were all in leaf. I knelt on the grass and examined it
closely. Was it actually growing? or had it reached its crisis and
this was the last day of all? I could not tell, but the grass
looked fresh and healthy enough.</p>

<p>By the time I reached Buckingham Palace it was a quarter to two,
and I felt hungry again. I went into the Palace unchallenged. I
wandered about the vast corridors and reception-rooms. At last I
came to the kitchens and larders. I found there a profusion of food
little less imposing than that at Messrs. Harridge's.</p>

<p>"Well, after all," I thought, "why not? His Majesty would hardly
begrudge a meal to his only remaining subject."</p>

<p>I made a fire with wood and coal, and cooked myself a cutlet and
boiled some Brussels sprouts ( I am very fond of sprouts). I placed
the meal on a tray and carried it up to the Throne Room. I sat on
the Throne of England and solemnly consumed my cutlet. I am
probably the only man who has ever eaten a cutlet whilst seated on
a throne. It was not very comfortable, but the irony of the
situation pleased me. Humour has never been considered my strong
point, but I was sensible enough to see that whatever humour I had
must be developed in order to sustain me through my amazing
ordeal.</p>

<p>I kept on pinching myself and saying: "Well, of course, all this
is simply a dream."</p>

<p>Then I would go to the window and look out. But no, I never felt
so vital and awake before in my life. Everything was vivid and
tangible. It had not that nebulous quality which characterized a
dream. Something abnormal and supernatural had happened, and I had
to face it. I had heard of people finding themselves in colourably
similar predicaments&mdash;being lost on a desert island, for
instance&mdash;and I knew that the great thing was to retain one's
sanity.</p>

<p>I had really hardly yet begun to think. I was observing and
taking my bearings. Serious thinking must come later. I must simply
keep sane.</p>

<p>In one of the courtyards of the Palace I came across several
large motor-cars. Another bright inspiration came to me. During the
war I had had the honour of being allowed to drive a V.A.D.
ambulance. I knew quite a bit about cars. I hurried to the first
one, a large touring Daimler. To my intense delight, the
self-starter acted promptly. I released the clutch and the thing
moved. This was perhaps the most satisfactory experience of the
day. With a car I could accomplish a great deal. I raced out into
the Mall. If need be, I could escape to the country, go up North,
or to the coast. There must be life somewhere. Then it occurred to
me that it would be an interesting experiment to go first to the
Zoo. I returned up Regent Street and I could not help grinning when
I realized that I automatically had to toot my horn and slow up at
corners. I was at the Zoo in less than fifteen minutes. Leaving the
car outside I clambered over the turnstiles. My worst apprehensions
were fulfilled. AH the animals had vanished. I ran from house to
house. There was no living thing. By some of the houses the ground
appeared to be scratched up, as though the animals might have
scratched their way out and escaped. Here and there I came across
bleached bones and skulls. I believe I could have made a life-long
friend of a sea-lion if only the thing had been there. Once I
thought I saw a mouse scamper across a jackal's cage, but I could
not be certain.</p>

<p>I gave up the Zoo and returned to my car. What should I do?
After mature reflection I decided to give up going into the country
till the morrow. I would thoroughly explore London first. After all
there seemed more probability of meeting people, or finding some
solution here rather than among the fields and commons. I went
round Regent's Park to the Finchley Road&mdash;and then on to
Hampstead, keeping my eyes skinned all the time for any appearance
of life. I went all through Hampstead and Highgate, and then
through Camden Town, Islington and Highbury. I made my way back to
the City and the East-end. I went to St. Paul's Cathedral, and
entered it questioningly. The great temple of the people gave me
back no answer.</p>

<p>I crawled slowly down Cheapside and Fleet Street. My eyes were
constantly intrigued by advertisements. "So-and-so's Soap."
"Broadstairs is so Bracing." "A readymade suit for seventy
shillings." "Give her Bovril." "George Robey to-night at the
Coliseum."</p>

<p>I <i>must</i> keep sane.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon I went back to the bank. Nothing had
changed. I tried the telephone again, but this time I did not even
hear the hum of the wires. I was feeling physically exhausted and
mentally overwrought by the day's experience. Where should I spend
the night? I had the choice of Buckingham Palace, the Savoy or
Carlton, or my own bed. I quickly decided in favour of the latter.
But first of all I must have another good meal. It surprised me
that in this respect I felt well and eager for good things. I
eventually went down to the Carlton, and once more routed out the
kitchens. I venture to say that I prepared myself a meal that the
chef himself would not have been too contemptuous of.</p>

<p>After my dinner I lay back in the lounge in the Carlton and
reflected. (I almost wished I had worn evening dress I) It was
certainly a situation which demanded profound reflection.</p>

<p>"One shall be taken and the other left."</p>

<p>Assuming that there had been some cataclysmic spiritual
manifestation, why should all the others be taken and I left? I
carefully reviewed the record of my past life. I could
conscientiously say that I had little to reproach myself with. I
had always been scrupulously honest, industrious, and sincere. I
had been a regular and devout communicant at St. Mary's Church,
Marylebone. I had no recollection of ever having done a
contemptible or mean action. I may on occasions have been a little
quicktempered, a little uncharitable to my subordinates, but surely
not sufficiently so to arouse the wrath of God.</p>

<p>But what was the position? What was God's idea? I found myself
alone, and in charge not only of the South-repps Bank in Baker
Street, but of the whole of London. I was King, Prime Minister, and
proprietor. I could go and draw out a hundred million pounds in
cash to-morrow and drive away&mdash;whither?</p>

<p>But more practical details began to impress themselves. At the
present moment London was full of fresh food, fruit, and
vegetables. On the other hand, there was no electric light or gas.
There was no one to attend to the water or the drainage, or to
scavenging in general. The streets were already untidy. In a few
days all the food would go bad. In a week's time the whole place
would be pestilentially insanitary. No, it was obviously the wisest
course to clear out. It would be best to find a small house by
itself somewhere in the country or near the sea, a house with a
well, perhaps. I could take with me stores of tinned food,
sufficient to last for years; and then I could grow vegetables and
fruit. I would go to one of the libraries and get books on this
subject. The sea was the most attractive proposition. Perhaps some
foreign ship would come along. Were all countries and cities like
this? Possibly not. And yet, there was no suggestion of a local
annihilation, no suspicion of poison-gas or plague. In this case
there would be the gruesome evidence of dead bodies. Everyone had
just vanished. I was entirely alone. And yet&mdash;what was that
voice on the telephone?</p>

<p>The evening was drawing on. I left the Carlton, drove up the
Haymarket in my car, called at a stores, and commandeered several
boxes of candles. I could see that another difficulty was going to
be bread. I must store quantities of flour, and read up from books
how to make bread. In the meantime, there were plenty of dry
unsweetened biscuits in tins. I filled up my car&mdash;or rather,
His Majesty's car&mdash;with all the edibles for my immediate use,
and then drove back to my rooms in Motcombe Street.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly worn out, but I found the sight of my small
familiar properties comforting. I smoked and reflected for another
hour, and then I went to bed. Having persuaded myself that I could
do nothing but trust to God and my good conscience, I soon fell
into a profound sleep.</p>

<p>I don't know how long I had been sleeping when I was disturbed
by a disconcerting noise. I awakened with a start, and listened.
When I realized what it was I could extract little comfort from a
sound which, although unusual in the room I occupied, was quite
familiar as a human experience.</p>

<p>It was the sound of a mouse or rat nibbling in the wainscoting
in a corner of the room. Now, it had always been a boast of Mrs.
Buswell's that her house was free from vermin of any sort, and I
knew that this was no idle boast. I threw a boot into the corner,
and the sound ceased. In five minutes' time, however, it started
again. When one's nerves are already a little on edge, there is
nothing so disconcerting in the stillness of the night as this
restless gnaw, gnaw, with the uncertainty of the progress and exact
location of the rodent. I lighted a candle and banged on the floor
again. Again there was a pause, but only of the briefest duration.
I left the candle burning, and so tired was I that after a time I
did fall asleep. It must have been several hours later when I awoke
with an involuntary start, warned by some foreboding movement of
the quilt. I opened my eyes in time to see a large brown rat
scuttle from the bed and dart out of sight. My heart beat violently
with pure dread.</p>

<p>Now, in nearly all living creatures there is some element of
companionableness, but in the rat&mdash;no! It is surely the most
sinister figure, next to the snake, in all organic life. I yearned
for living contact, but with the rat&mdash;oh, dear, no! I leapt
out of bed. The candle was guttering in its socket, and I quickly
lighted another. I shouted and hit the floor with my boots. There
was no sign of the rat. However, I found the hole through which he
had come, and I feverishly stuffed it up with a towel dipped in
paraffin. But I knew I should not sleep again that night. I lighted
more candles. I opened my bedroom door an inch or two, and I could
not be certain, but I fancied I heard scuttling and scuffling on
the linoleum of the passage. I shut the door quickly and spread
another towel along the bottom of it.</p>

<p>That decided me. First thing in the morning I would load up my
car and leave London. It was just what one might have expected.
Directly humanity departed, these awful things would come into
their own. In a few days London would probably be overrun with
rats. I took down a book and read until daylight filtered between
the window curtains.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light enough I arose. I went first to see if
my good car was outside. I don't know what I thought could have
happened to it, but in this crumbling world I realized that the
Daimler was the only friend I had. The sight of it in the road
beneath almost brought a lump into my throat. When I had
breakfasted I made a list of the things I must not forget to take
with me, not forgetting petrol and clothes. There would be a
certain pleasant satisfaction in rummaging in the big stores,
helping myself to a fur overcoat worth a thousand pounds, and
choosing the finest linen and wool. Then I would have a clock, and
a diary, for I decided during the night that, whatever the future
held in store for me, I would accept philosophically. Within my
capacity I would lead a normal life. I would shave and dress
meticulously, as befitted the sub-manager of the Southrepps Bank.
And I would set everything down and keep a record, so that if there
were some ultimate solution of this crazy problem I should be in a
stronger position to deal with it. Moreover, an ordered and
disciplined life would keep me sane.</p>

<p>I made out my list, collected a few household goods, and went
out to the car. I put the things in the car, and was just about to
board it when an appalling sight met my gaze. I could do nothing
but walk round the car and mutter, "My God!"</p>

<p><i>All the four tyres had been gnawed to ribbons!</i>
</p>

<p>I thought of my unpleasant visitor of the night and a cold
horror gripped my heart. It was not that there was anything very
surprising in a rat gnawing through a motor-tyre, but there was a
suggestion of deliberation about this. The tyres had not been
eaten. They were just ripped to pieces as though for a purpose.</p>

<p>I had to admonish myself roundly for giving way to an explosion
of despair.</p>

<p>"All right, William, don't lose your hair. There are plenty of
other cars in London. You saw hundreds yesterday."</p>

<p>I remembered that there were three taxi-cabs on the rank in the
Marylebone Road. Without hesitating a second I ran down the street
and turned the corner. There was no need for me to cross the road.
The three cabs were resting on their iron rims, the tyres all flat
and torn!</p>

<p>"Steady! Steady!" I thought. "There must be some locked up in
garages that the rats wouldn't have been able to get at."</p>

<p>I walked towards the wealthy residential quarters of Portland
Place and Harley Street. Some of the garages were locked up, and I
had to batter down the doors with iron bars or anything I could
find. It was a pilgrimage ol despair. I spent the whole morning
wandering from street to street, from garage to garage. I inspected
hundreds of cars, but not one had a tyre intact.</p>

<p>I lunched at the Carlton again, and attempted to formulate a new
plan. Of course, there was nothing to prevent me walking out of
London, but how was I to carry all my kit? I might get a barrow and
load that up, but it would be an arduous journey, and owing to the
sedentary life I had always led I was not very strong, and not a
very good walker. London is by no means an easy place to walk out
of. It would mean at least a ten or twelve-mile walk, pushing a
heavy barrow. But there seemed no alternative. I could not spend
another night in this awful city, alone amongst the loathsome
creatures.</p>

<p>It took me nearly two hours to find a barrow, which I eventually
did in Co vent Garden Market. I trundled it up the deserted streets
to Messrs. Harridge's. But on my wanderings in search of the barrow
I made another significant discovery. You may remember that on the
previous day the wooden pavement outside Piccadilly Tube Station
gave me the impression that someone had begun to dig it up and had
then neglected it. I now discovered that this was something very
different. It was a warren of small holes leading into the earth.
The same condition prevailed on the Haymarket side of the Tube, and
also at Leicester Square and Oxford Circus.</p>

<p>After making this discovery I went tentatively into Piccadilly
Tube Station, and went a little way down the spiral staircase till
it was too dark to see. A horrible odour assailed my nostrils, and
I hastily retreated. So that was it! It required no special
astuteness to envisage that vast warren and storehouse beneath,
with arteries connecting with the whole underworld of London. I
thought of the many evenings I had travelled in the Tubes about
theatre time, the gay lighting, pretty women in opera cloaks and
jolly youngsters out for an evening's fun, and then with a shudder
I thought of it now committed to eternal darkness and foulness,
controlled, moreover, by a mysterious cunning and sense of order.
The thought was unbearable.</p>

<p>When I arrived at Harridge's with my barrow I was trembling all
over. I wandered over the premises with my list, and chose the
things I wanted. It took much longer than I had anticipated, and in
the course of it I was subjected to further ominous misgivings. For
one thing, whereas on the previous day there had been scores of
boxes of candles, to-day there was not one in the building. Neither
were there any cheeses, lard, or butter. In the provision
department some hams which I had suspected of being slightly
tainted had disappeared. The fresh food remained untouched. Every
room, every floor and partition was honeycombed with holes.
Harridge's was being carefully watched.</p>

<p>This experience made me all the more anxious to get away from
London.</p>

<p>The barrow was very heavy when I had loaded it up, and I still
had to go back to Motcombe Street to collect the things I had left
in the car. As it was getting late I decided that I would only go
as far as Richmond that night. I would sleep there, and then push
on into Surrey the next day.</p>

<p>I tried at several other places to get candles, but they had all
disappeared.</p>

<p>By the time I had had a meal and was ready to start it was
sundown. I hesitated as to whether I would try and endure one more
night in my Motcombe Street rooms, but my first resolution was
fortified by the discovery that all the candles I had taken home
the previous day had also disappeared. I could have a fire, but
otherwise the evening would have to be spent in darkness.</p>

<p>I added the final touches to my strange outfit and started off
down the Marylebone Road. I decided to walk to Hammersmith, go
across Barnes Bridge, and so on to Richmond that way. I reckoned on
a good two hours' walk. But in doing so I had not allowed for
inevitable rests. For the first few hundred yards the barrow load
did not seem unduly heavy, but by the time I had reached Hyde Park
I felt as though I were pushing a railway truck laden with coal. I
was panting and puffing, and my hands were chafed and my back
ached. I took a good rest and started again. All along the side of
the Park as far as Notting Hill I had to rest every dozen yards or
so. When I reached Shepherd's Bush I felt doubtful whether I could
proceed. I was quite done up, and it was already getting dark. I
rested disconsolately on the edge of the barrow. Whilst doing so,
my eye caught sight of a rather gaudy public-house. I had never in
my life entered one of these places, but it flashed through my mind
that here was an occasion when the most fastidious could hardly
grieve at my defection. I entered the saloon bar. There was no lack
of every conceivable alcoholic refreshment, I drank a wineglassful
of neat brandy, and added the bottle to my effects. At the same
time I discarded some of my tinned food in order to lighten the
load. The effect of the brandy temporarily ameliorated the outlook,
but I was very weary and feverishly anxious to get on. I had an
impatient desire to get to the other side of the river. I felt I
would rather sleep in the open in Richmond Park, or on Barnes
Common, than endure another night in any of these unlighted and
cheerless houses. Moreover, I tried several times to dissuade
myself from accepting a conscious realization&mdash;things already
moving and scurrying in the fringes of the coming darkness!</p>

<p>As I struggled on painfully towards Plammersmith Broadway I
became gradually obsessed by a terrifying conviction. <i>I was
being watched!</i> A dark power was encircling me, and when the
moment came, I&mdash;I could not tell what would happen, but I knew
that I should no longer be master of my fate. I kept to the middle
of the road and prayed for strength. Just past the Broadway a swarm
of black objects swung in a body across my barrow from left to
right. A minute later another swarm swung across from right to
left. I looked back, and I became aware of a vast semi-circle of
black movement following me.</p>

<p>Before I had reached Barnes Bridge, I knew that I could not go
on. In any case, I could not go on with my load. I would discard my
barrow and run for it, chancing to find on the other side of the
river the necessities I needed. Perhaps on the morrow I could
return and reclaim my property in daylight. I left the barrow and
strode forward swinging a stick. It was less than a hundred yards
to the bridge, but before I had reached it I knew that I was
defeated. A pale moon was up and I could see sufficient. It was not
so much numbers that paralysed my will to go on, as the sense that
at the back of them was an ordered plan, a sinister intelligence.
I'm afraid I gave way to a moment of self-pity. I saw myself, the
conscientious and scrupulous sub-manager of the Southrepps Bank, a
pitiable figure, struggling to do his duty, and to behave as became
a Christian gentleman, and then&mdash;hemmed in and mastered by a
dark, unjust fate.</p>

<p>As I stood by the bridge, uncertain how to act, I was suddenly
startled by a new amazement. Creeping along the near bank was a
small tramp steamer or freighter. It was moving. There was smoke
coming out of the funnel. I could almost swear that I could see the
figure of a man at the wheel. Then, as I peered more eagerly, I was
certain that, though there might be a man at the wheel, the deck of
the steamer was swarming with that same dark restless movement. At
the top of my voice I yelled out:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo! there! Who's that? Land, I say, for God's
sake!"</p>

<p>The steamer crept under the bridge and appeared the other side.
I rushed to it and screamed out again:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo! I say. Is that a man? For God's sake, land!"</p>

<p>I waited. There was a noise of squeaking and the rushing of
water. As the steamer began to crawl out of sight, I could swear I
heard a husky answer:</p>

<p>"I can't. They won't let me!"</p>

<p>I groaned and cried out again, but no further answer came
back.</p>

<p>Then, indeed, was I becoming desperate. Why did the creatures
not attack me and make an end? I was utterly at their mercy. For a
moment I hesitated whether I would not rush on to the Bridge and
throw myself into the river, but the idea of suicide has always
appeared to me to be of all crimes, next to murder, the most
irreligious. No, I would fight to the end.</p>

<p>I walked back to my barrow, my consciousness almost numbed into
indifference. So absorbed was I with my spiritual tribulations that
I hardly heeded the movements of my black masters. I stood by the
barrow hesitating, and then the strangest thing of all happened. I
became aware of concentric movements, of swerves and formations,
like an army at manoeuvres.</p>

<p>"Now," I thought, "it's coming. Well, let it be
quick&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was in the middle of the road, and I could see fairly well. I
waited patiently, stick in hand. The manoeuvres seemed suddenly to
a stop, as though the Generalissimo had achieved a perfect
formation. Then two bodies detached themselves and took up
positions on either side of me. I could even see their leaders
gleaming menacingly on the flanks. And then a third smaller body
approached between them. It was apparently conveying a large dark
object. The whole cavalcade appeared to be closing in on me, and
then it suddenly retreated, leaving the dark object at my feet.</p>

<p>I peered down. It was a large brown rat, a very prince of rats,
an enormous fellow. He was wounded in the right leg, whether
through fighting or through falling on a sharp object I could not
say. The command was obvious. I was being watched by ten thousand
specks of light.</p>

<p><br>
I praised God for the thoroughness of my preparations before
leaving Harridge's. I had a first-aid outfit, and during the war I
had picked up a little knowledge of the valuable craft. I took the
things from the barrow, being careful to show no signs of hurry or
suspicion. Then I knelt down and bathed the wound, which was
bleeding, applied some antiseptic, and bound it up with a clean
bandage. I did it as well as I possibly could. The brown rat never
stirred. As a brilliant afterthought I smeared a little brandy over
his nose. I could not be sure how this would affect him, but I
thought the experiment might be worth while. Then I drew apart and
waited, to show that the operation was over. Followed a lot of
squeaking and whispering, the movement of further formations, and
the removal of the invalid. Nonchalantly I strolled off down the
street back to Hammersmith. I went unmolested, nevertheless, the
sense of depression became accentuated. Before I was in open
warfare; now I felt that I was a slave. If I was useful to them
they would neither kill me nor let me go.</p>

<p>Strolling back towards Kensington the truth of the whole
situation began to dawn on me. The voice on the telephone, the
black cat, the man on the steamer, myself&mdash;Humanity was not
defunct. It had simply been superseded. The earth was now dominated
by the rat. Man was a subsidiary and servile creature. A few human
beings would be allowed to live, provided they served some useful
purpose in the rodentary scheme of things.</p>

<p>In Kensington I found a large private hotel. I was tired, dazed,
and beaten. I stumbled in and found my way to a room on the top
floor. I struck matches, and satisfied myself that there were no
holes in the floor or walls. Then I threw myself on to the bed and
fell into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p>It was, of course, only to wake later to the abrupt irritation
of that gnaw, gnaw, gnaw in the skirting.</p>

<p>"I shall go mad!" I whispered. Then:</p>

<p>"William, if ever there was a time to pull yourself together it
is now. What is to prevent you walking out of London to-morrow
morning? They don't come out in daylight. Get right away into the
clean, sweet air of the country, and leave everything. Better to
die of starvation or exposure than endure this. Besides, who knows
but that you may find a colony of humans somewhere?"</p>

<p>The gnawing went on, but I slept by fits and starts. My fears
were somehow less directly personal. I felt that my services to the
old brown rat would in some way secure me from immediate attack.
Once during the night I know that a rat scuttled across the bed. I
had no candles, and I was too weary to protest. What would be the
good? If I went to another room they would quickly make their way
thither. I tried to visualize London a hundred years hence, a
mouldy ruin entirely perforated, like an old leaf that has been
pressed between the leaves of a book and forgotten. It seemed
surprising that it was less than forty-eight hours ago that I had
been in this metamorphosed existence, and it already held me in an
ice-cold grip of fatality. If I could consider the matter logically
and dispassionately I might be able to persuade myself that I was
despairing too rapidly, surrendering too easily. But I was
enveloped by an atmosphere in which logic seemed to have no place,
reason no throne. A few days and nights of this and I should be an
old man.</p>

<p>The dawn at last. I rose hastily and began to dress. I had not
completed my toilette before I was confronted with a new disaster.
<i>The soles of my boots had been eaten!</i> There was again in
this the menace of deliberate purpose. There could have been no
reason to have eaten my boots for the nourishment they contained.
London was chock-full of food. I wandered over the hotel. I found
five pairs of gentlemen's boots. In each case the soles had been
destroyed. On the other hand, I found seven pairs of ladies' shoes.
They were untouched. Why?</p>

<p>So soon as I had consumed a hasty meal I hurried out into the
street in my socks. After a brief search I found a bootmaker's
shop. One glance satisfied me. All the boxes had been pulled down
and eaten into, and the soles of the boots destroyed. Even some
ladies' boots of the larger kind were destroyed; but there were
plenty of the latter with Louis heels and useless pointed toes. The
thing was diabolic. Could I walk out of London in my socks? In any
case I would try. It was my only hope. I bound my feet up in thick
bandages, after covering them with vaseline. On the top of this I
wore two pairs of thick socks.</p>

<p>This time I would go North, where there was no river to cross. I
made up a small parcel of food and a change of clothing, and set
forth. I will not distress you with a description of that journey.
It was a dull record of pain, weariness, and mental anguish. I lost
all sense of time or space. Sometimes I would rest on a doorstep
and nibble at my food. A curious conviction came over me that I was
instinctively imitating the rats' method of eating. It was again
nearly dark before I found that the houses were getting more widely
separated, and there were occasional lapses of fields and open
spaces. Even then&mdash;there would be many miles to go before I
was clear of it all.</p>

<p>I had nearly reached the end of my tether, and was passing a
red-brick wall that might have been the outside wall of some
institution, when suddenly I thought I heard the sound of a cry on
the other side of the wall&mdash;a human cry! With a superhuman
effort I leapt at the wall and scrambled to the top. Just on the
other side I beheld a woman. She was kneeling down and collecting
something from the ground. In the most futile and inane fashion I
called out:</p>

<p>"Hullo! Good-evening!"</p>

<p>She turned her face to me. It was the saddest face I have ever
seen. At the sight of me it expressed neither relief nor pleasure.
It simply looked utterly hopeless and scared. I said:</p>

<p>"Who are you? Will you come with me? Let us escape&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked round with a terrified glance, and muttered:</p>

<p>"No, no, no."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"They won't let me."</p>

<p>"Who won't?"</p>

<p>"The Masters."</p>

<p>And then with a groan she ran across the courtyard, and darted
through a gate which she slammed after her.</p>

<p><br>
Then I knew that all was finished. I was a creature in revolt. I
gripped my stick. I would not avoid rats any longer. I would seek
them out. I would attack, and die fighting for what I
represented.</p>

<p>I stumbled on to the next house I came to, a bleak buff-brick
villa. I stamped into the hall and cried out:</p>

<p>"Come on, you devils!"</p>

<p>A new strength seemed to enter my limbs. I went into a dark room
and struck at the floor and walls with my stick. But as the
strength came so it oozed away. Something unaccountable was
happening to me. I fell on to a couch and groaned. I seemed to be
rushing through space, through a noisy channel. At the other end
sounds detached themselves. I distinctly heard a voice say:</p>

<p>"Hullo, old man, that's better!"</p>

<p>There was an interval, and then the same voice said:</p>

<p>"Hullo, William, old man, you're all right now, eh? You
understand? You're all right."</p>

<p>The voice was strikingly familiar. Tom&mdash;of course, Tom
Stokes. What was he doing in this God-forsaken place? What place?
Where was I?</p>

<p>"You remember it all now, old man, don't you? We were having a
jolly talk about Bernard Shaw and Dean Inge&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dean Inge! The gloomy Dean, they called him. Something shaped
and cleared. I remembered a lot of things.</p>

<p>"I'll never forgive myself, old man. We were talking&mdash;a
jolly talk about what could happen to humanity. You leant over the
fireplace, knocking out your pipe. I reached up to get a spill,
and, like the clumsy ass I am, I knocked that big vase right over.
It fell on to your head. They've had to put in a couple of
stitches. You're all right now, old man, eh?"</p>

<p>More familiar than Tom's voice&mdash;the cosy security of my own
room. More dear to me than Tom's face&mdash;the eyes of my wife
welcoming me back. Queer, that all that part of my life had been
forgotten, that I should have jumped back to the time when I was a
sub-manager at a small bank. Queer&mdash;</p>

<p>"What could happen to humanity? The gloomy Dean, the gloomy
Dean. Yes&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yes, I remembered it all.</p>

<p>Thank God!</p>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. WHAT <i>WAS</i> SHE TO
THINK?</h2>

<p>Muriel Upwey was surely as perfect a wife as man could desire.
She was young, pretty and docile. She had about her that air of
helpless dependence which all men sneakingly value above all
womanly virtues. Her husband, Sam, owned a timber works just
outside Tibbelsford. He was a bearded man, considerably her senior,
and of a stern and upright character. He left home at nine o'clock
every morning and returned at six in the evening. His slippers and
his pipe, and his supper were always ready for him, and during the
evening Muriel would sit in rapt adoration whilst he talked about
timber and religion. For he was a very religious man. They went to
church twice every Sunday, and every evening he read out aloud a
chapter of the Bible before going to bed. He did not read very
well, having some defect in the cavity of his mouth, which caused
him to whistle some words and mumble others, but Muriel sat
enchanted. The next day she would call on some friend and talk
about timber, and lay great stress on how the world needed
religion, and what a noble and fine character was her husband. The
themes might possibly have bored the neighbours except that
Tibbelsford is rather a dull town, and a chat with any one is
always welcome. Besides, one is not bound to pay too much
attention. One can lie in wait, and at the first opportunity pounce
upon the situation and tell about what an exciting affair it was at
the Poulteney Jones' lantern lecture on Belgian churches, or dilate
upon that new face cream that Laura was recommended by the wife of
a man who came to make an estimate for re-papering the
drawing-room. Fair's fair. Even timber has its limitations of
interest. Even the Bible you can have too much of. There are other
men in the world besides Sam Upwey. Nevertheless, Muriel was very
much liked, as the helpless and yielding always are. Does it not
say somewhere, "Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the
earth?"</p>

<p>Sometimes she would visit the timber works and stare reverently
at the great piles of timber, and listen to the saw mills at work.
They make a lovely screaming whirr with a jolly plonk at the end
which meant that more wood was sawn up. It was a grateful and
satisfying sound&mdash;things being done, needs being supplied, Sam
being enriched. And at night she would dream of timber and of great
forests with wolves darting about amongst the trees. And she would
be frightened, and then Sam would appear, and would look so strong
and his beard look so fierce that all the wolves would run away,
and she would feel frightened no longer. Indeed, so impressive
would he be that she would not like even to mention the wolves. He
would roll up his sleeves and say: "Watch me. I am going to chop
down all these trees, all the trees in the world. You must
understand, my dear, that throughout all time wood has always been
the greatest friend to man. It has protected him, warmed him, and
adorned his habitations."</p>

<p>And lo! the forest would suddenly turn into vast stacks of
timber and saw mills, and she would wake up. Sam would sometimes
search the Scriptures with a rather resentful expression on his
face because he could find no reference to the fact of the Lord
having made wood. He made light, and fire, and water, and all these
other things, then why not wood, which was a much kindlier
element?</p>

<p>He was also something of a politician, and strangely enough for
one so orthodox he was inclined to express extremely liberal views.
He was indeed almost a Socialist. It was only when it came to the
paying of his own workpeople that he hedged a little in principle.
The consequence was that Muriel read the leading articles in the
liberal newspapers, and at Mrs. Wain wright's she would talk quite
passionately about the iniquities of the unequal distribution of
wealth, and the virtues of Trades-unionism, and the blessings of
Free Trade.</p>

<p>When they had been married three years Muriel presented her
husband with a son. Needless to say the delight of both parents was
unbounded. They would sit and talk by the hour about the small
person's future. They discussed his food and training and
education, and decided that he should be called Hector Samuel, and
that he should go into the timber trade, and become a good
churchman and a liberal. Alas! for some of these best laid plans.
When the child was only six years old Samuel Upwey died. He died
quite nicely, from heart failure during an attack of pneumonia.
Muriel was terribly upset. It was said at all the tea-tables in
Tibbelsford that had it not been for the child she would have died
from grief. She wore the deepest mourning just like women do on the
Continent. She shut herself up, and read the Bible. She went
nowhere except to church. She wrapped her life round Master Hector
Samuel. The timber works were sold to a company, and out of the
proceeds she derived a small but sufficient income to live in
comfort. Friends called on her and offered what consolation they
could, but she was inconsolable. She had several enlargements made
of her late husband's photograph, and also of the timber yard.
These she framed, and they were hung in conspicuous places all over
the house. She would sit and gaze at them, and she would tell
Hector Samuel what a great and good man his father had been, and
how it must be the ambition of his life to live up to that noble
example. And as he grew older she told him all about wood, what a
great friend wood had always been to man, and what an important
part timber had played in all our lives. And she Instilled into him
the value of religion, and explained about the unfair distribution
of wealth, and what splendid institutions were Free Trade and
Trades-unionism. And Hector Samuel said: "Yes, mamma."</p>

<p>He was just a healthy, rather ordinary little boy, but in the
eyes of Muriel he was the most wonderful thing that ever lived, and
we have no right to laugh at her for thinking so.</p>

<p>It is as it should be.</p>

<p>When he was twelve years old, she sent him to a public school.
The parting with him was a perfect nightmare. She could see no
virtue in sending a boy to a public school, but she remembered that
Samuel had expressed the opinion that it was good for a boy, and he
had intended sending Hector. He was four years at Beestoke College,
and Muriel simply lived for the holidays. She kept a calendar and
ticked off the days. She wrote to him every other day, and always
sent him little presents and sums of money. For the rest she lived
the life almost of a recluse. Occasionally she would visit Mrs.
Wainwright or some other lady friend, but when she did so she
appeared preoccupied and uninterested. She held the same opinions
that she had held when Sam was alive, but they were lacking in
force or enthusiasm. She could think and talk of nothing but Hector
Samuel. She was getting thin, and her friends predicted that she
would go into a decline. So ill did she appear one summer that Mrs.
Wainwright persuaded her to consult a doctor. As she said:
"Remember, my dear, you haven't only yourself to consider. What
would happen to Hector if you&mdash;er&mdash;you understand my
meaning&mdash;?"</p>

<p>And Muriel understood. She called in Doctor Anscombe, a genial,
middle-aged man, who wore an imperial and a Harris tweed suit, and
drove about the country in a dogcart, played golf, and belonged to
the Tibbelsford Constitutional Club. After examining her he
said:</p>

<p>"There's nothing much the matter with you. You want feeding up,
and you ought to play golf."</p>

<p>And a tear came into Muriel's eye. Golf! There was something a
little shocking about the suggestion. Golf and Samuel! Oh, dear no,
this man didn't understand her. She said:</p>

<p>"I don't think I'd like to do that."</p>

<p>He laughed and said: "Well, that's my prescription. But if you
like, I'll give you a tonic as well, But, my dear lady, do get out
in the air as much as possible."</p>

<p>She thanked him and took the tonic. When he called a few days
later, she was certainly looking a little better. She had been out
for one or two walks. In a curious way the doctor himself seemed to
be a tonic. She liked his breezy manner of speech, the smell of
Harris tweed, the something vital and hopeful about him.</p>

<p>As the summer wore on, and she got stronger, she looked forward
to his visits. He did her good. And he always said something that
was amusing and entertaining. She showed him the photographs of
Samuel and of Hector and he seemed interested. By the end of July
she was quite well again, and she would probably have lost touch
with the doctor altogether, had it not been for the fact that two
days after Hector came home for the holidays he developed German
measles, and Doctor Anscombe attended him. He came every day for a
week, and was very attentive and sympathetic.</p>

<p>And one day Muriel found him looking at her. Now there are all
kinds of ways of one person looking at another. But there is one
kind of way that means only one thing. And Muriel understood. When
he had gone she looked at herself in the mirror with an expression,
half troubled, half elated. She was now thirty-four, and her large
wondering eyes beheld a face by no means unbeautiful. She turned
away and as though appealing for succour she gazed at the
enlargement of Sam's photograph. Poor Sam! how good he was! how
noble and helpful, just like the noble and helpful wood that he
devoted his life to.</p>

<p>She visited Hector, who was getting better, and sufficiently
amenable to concede the fact that the doctor was "a decent sort."
Hector got quite well, but the doctor still continued to come. And
one day he insisted on taking her out for a drive in his dog-cart.
He drove well, and he looked quite handsome, sitting bolt upright,
and making funny little clicking noises at the mare. He told her a
lot of interesting things about trees, and birds, and plants, and
people. Muriel was very impressed. On only one point did she feel
perturbed. She happened to ask him what church he attended, and he
laughed and said:</p>

<p>"The last time I went to church was when I got christened. I
propose to go twice more."</p>

<p>Muriel, puzzled, said: "When?"</p>

<p>"When I get married, and when I get buried."</p>

<p>What an odd man! It is difficult to discuss religion in a
dog-cart, but she did ask him his views, and in his rich burr of a
voice, he shouted into the wind surprising and shocking theories.
He always got back to trees, and birds, and plants, and people. And
Muriel found herself only partially listening to him. She was
fascinated by his voice, and by the firm lines of his nose and
chin, and the brown eyes which seemed to register the movements of
the mare, and yet to be absorbing all the living phenomena of the
countryside. There was danger here. It seemed dangerous sitting up
in the high dog-cart, alongside this dangerous man with his
dangerous theories. So dangerous that she invited him home to tea,
an invitation which he readily accepted.</p>

<p>When Hector Samuel went back to school she did a surprising
thing. She failed to appear at church the following Sunday at
either morning or evening service.</p>

<p>This defection so alarmed little Miss Wainwright that she called
on her the next afternoon. Muriel appeared curiously evasive about
it. No, she had not been ill. She just thought she wouldn't go. She
quickly changed the subject. She talked about trees and birds and
about the genius of Hector Samuel.</p>

<p>And as the weeks and months passed, Miss Wainwright detected
more and more surprises in her friend. One afternoon she called and
began to talk about what iniquitous institutions Trades-unions
were. Miss Wainwright said:</p>

<p>"But, my dear, you've always been a keen believer in
Trades-unions."</p>

<p>Muriel stared at her, open-eyed and wonderful. She didn't seem
to remember, or if she did&mdash;well, it was as clear as daylight
now that Trades-unions were an evil. What the country needed was a
strong Conservative Government, with benevolent ideals.</p>

<p>A few days later, Miss Wainwright found her taking down several
of the enlargements of Sam's photograph. Then she began to get
suspicious. The suspicions reached their climax when she heard from
a reliable source that Mrs. Upwey had been seen on the golf-links
having lessons from Dr. Anscombe! Golf! It was the beginning of the
end.</p>

<p>Actually it was another six months before she married the
doctor. They chose the beginning of the summer term when Hector
Samuel had just gone back to school. After the first shock the boy
had taken it very well, and he and the doctor got on splendidly.
She gave up her house, and the enlargements of Samuel and the
timber yard were buried in a lumber-room at the doctor's. She was a
loving and devoted wife. She looked after his house, saw to it that
his consulting-room was always warm and tidy. When he was called up
in the night, she would have hot tea ready for him on his return.
She learnt to play golf, and she even read The Lancet. She took an
absorbing interest in his work. At Miss Wainwright's she would hold
forth on the wonders and miracles of medical science, and explain
how her dear John was probably the cleverest doctor in the world,
and one of the noblest men who ever lived. Once her friend said to
her:</p>

<p>"When <i>are</i> you coming to church again, Muriel?"</p>

<p>"I shall only go once move," she said.</p>

<p>"When do you mean?"</p>

<p>"When I am buried."</p>

<p>This heathen confession nearly lost her a friendship. She
hastened to add that she had nothing against the church, but that
she believed one could be just as good and religious without going.
And she talked about trees and birds and plants and people till she
was well out of her depth.</p>

<p>Her devotion to her husband was only equalled by her adoration
of her son. She still ticked off the days from the calendar against
his return. Her only dread in life was that her two beloved idols
might not get on with each other. But the first holidays reassured
her. Hector Samuel was developing into a healthy, sensible boy. He
accepted the intrusion of a step-father gracefully. They did not
see a great deal of each other, as the doctor was very busy at that
time and frequently did not get back from his rounds till late. But
when he had time to spare for the boy they talked animatedly about
cricket and school life. And Muriel listened absorbedly, her eyes
glowing with pride and satisfaction. The darlings! They would grow
fond of each other. She was surrounded by love; love, and
cleverness, and beauty. Oh, how clever John was, and how clever
Hector was becoming. He could even talk about chemistry and motor
cars. He knew all about the best makes, and she was able to say one
day at a tea-party at Mrs. Altringham's:</p>

<p>"Oh, but you know, my dear, the Rolio is easily the best motor
bicycle on the market."</p>

<p>And Mrs. Altringham was duly impressed.</p>

<p>It was at about this time that Dr. Anscombe became an ardent
tariff reformer. He joined the local tariff reform league, and
Muriel went to lectures and studied all the papers in favour of
this measure. And she went about telling everyone that "we shall
never have prosperity in this country with this wretched Free-trade
Government. What we have got to do is to make the foreigner
pay."</p>

<p>Apart from his extensive practice, Dr. Anscombe had a small
private income. And so they were comparatively well off. It was
decided that when he had finished school Hector should be sent up
to Cambridge. Muriel sighed when this decision was arrived at. She
had been looking forward to Hector leaving school. John was out so
much. She had visualized the day when she had both her men to
herself. Then Hector would always be about the house, and she could
administer to him. And they would go for walks together, and she
would be able to say: "This is my son."</p>

<p>It was Hector himself who threw out hints about Cambridge. Some
of his colleagues were going up. And it was John who championed the
idea. He had been at Cambridge himself, and he would like the boy
to have every opportunity. It was unlikely that they would ever
have children of their own. What could she do against this united
wish? What could she say when both her men joined forces? She
meekly accepted the situation. It meant another three years partial
separation, and what then?</p>

<p>Hector was only two years at Cambridge, however. He developed an
extraordinary craze for drawing and painting. He wanted to go in
for art. Now people go to Cambridge for all kinds of things, but
they don't go there to study art. The boy was clamouring for Paris,
whither a friend of his had gone. Paris! but what an alarming and
dangerous suggestion! She fluttered around Tibbels-ford trying to
discover if there weren't some fount of artistic training to be had
there. The search was not very satisfactory. There certainly was a
middle-aged lady who taught flower-painting to a class of little
girls, but even she had not the audacity to suggest this would be
good enough for Hector. John considered the matter carefully over
many pipes, and in the end he enunciated:</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know much about art. I shouldn't think it means
an easy career. But everyone has to follow their own bent. If the
boy wants to become an artist, and Paris is the only place he can
learn in, he had better go there. I shan't stand in his way."</p>

<p>And next day, with tears in her voice, Muriel explained to Mrs.
Wainwright:</p>

<p>"You see, dear, everyone has to follow their own bent. Hector is
crazy to become an artist, and Paris is the only place he can learn
it in. Oh, dear! how long do you think it takes to learn?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Wainwright was of opinion that it would take at least two
years to learn, and then she added brightly:</p>

<p>"Oh, but perhaps your Hector, being so quick and clever, won't
take so long."</p>

<p>And so at the end of the term Hector left Cambridge and went
over to Mont Parnasse. He joined an art school, grew the inevitable
beard, and led the conventional life of the Quarter. Every three
months he came home for a short holiday, and those were golden but
anxious days for Muriel. Had he changed? What kind of life was he
leading? Were his friends <i>nice</i> people? Would he be quickly
through his career and be made a Royal Academician, and have a
large studio in Tibbelsford, and just go up to town for varnishing
days?</p>

<p>Hector Samuel was, if anything, a little more manly in his
appearance on his first return; a little more independent, and
restless, and anxious to show his knowledge of the world. After he
had returned Muriel was able to say to some ladies at a flower
show:</p>

<p>"Isn't it strange that there have been no great English painters
since Sir Joshua Reynolds, or was it Gainsborough?&mdash;you know,
the man who painted those lovely hats? They say that there are even
now a lot of great French painters, only they do it in a different
way. Wouldn't it be wonderful if Hector became the one great
English painter! That is why he is living in Paris, you know."</p>

<p>And she bought books on art, and read the lives of the painters.
She found it all very difficult to understand, and between the
pages would constantly occur the vision of Hector, in a velvet
suit, with a wreath of laurels round his head, receiving the
aristocracy at the top of the staircase at the Royal Academy. When
next in town she went to the National Gallery. She gazed awestruck
at the numerous masterpieces, but when she left she could not
remember Murillo as distinct from Rembrandt.</p>

<p>Whether Hector Samuel was quicker and cleverer than other boys
was a point we need not discuss. He spent three years in Paris and
at the end of that time he was by no means an artist&mdash;except
in the eyes of Muriel. But perhaps it takes a little longer? On the
other hand he certainly had made considerable progress. He gave the
promise of being a fair average portrait painter. It was quite
possible that he would end by not being a painter at all. He had
various interests and points of view, some of which were a little
alarming. Oh, why did everything and everybody alter and change!
Muriel wanted to hold everything dear to her tight. She wanted to
make it static, but she found it flowing past her. When he returned
from Paris nothing would do but that he must take a studio in
London&mdash;in Chelsea.</p>

<p>"You see, mother," he explained, waving aside her protests,
"nobody could possibly paint in Tibbelsford. It would be like
trying to paint in a coffin. Besides, I'll always be popping down
for the week-end."</p>

<p>On one of these occasions Hector brought down a friend with him,
a fellow student. And it was during this visit that Muriel received
a mental shock from which she was destined never entirely to
recover. It was Saturday night, and directly after dinner the
doctor had had to go out. She left the two young men sitting over
their claret, talking and smoking. Hector was very fond of
talking.</p>

<p>She wanted him to herself, and as they seemed a long time, she
tiptoed back to the dining-room. The door was slightly ajar. She
heard a voice talking excitedly. It was Hector's. And this is what
she overheard:</p>

<p>"Not at all, not at all! What I say is it's largely a question
of environment. Now you take the case of my step-father. He's quite
a decent old chap. I'm fond of him, but he's a cabbage. He knows
nothing. He doesn't even bother to keep up to date with his job. He
doesn't believe in the Bible, but he believes what the syndicated
press tells him. He even believes in tariff reform. Tariff reform!
I ask you. He's got the makings of an intelligent man, but he's a
kind of Dodo&mdash;"</p>

<p>Oh, Hector! Muriel hurried away. She went back quietly into the
drawing-room and shut the door. She walked across to the window in
the recess and opened it wider. It was a warm spring night. The air
was charged with the odour of spring flowers. There was no moon,
but the sky was light with the magic of clustering stars. Her
breath came in little stabs. Everything was moving and changing and
she wanted to keep it still. Oh, why had Hector said that? And yet
he had not spoken unkindly. "Quite a decent chap. I'm fond of him."
Thank you for that, Hector. He loved her, and John loved her. All
around was love; love, and beauty, and truth. Truth?...What were
the stars signalling to each other? Were they laughing at her? Ah,
no, they couldn't do that, because her heart was simple, and she
only wanted love and beauty, and truth. Such little things, such
big things; everything and nothing. A tear came into her eye, and
comforted her. It was not that. Love she had, love all around her.
Was that not the greatest thing of all? It was only that...Oh,
dear! Oh, dear! In the days to come what <i>was</i> she to
<i>think</i>!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. ONE THING LEADS TO
ANOTHER</h2>

<p class="cpb">I</p>

<p>"That's all very well," said Mr. William Egger. And after a
pause he repeated: "That's all very well."</p>

<p>In his shirt sleeves, carpet slippers, and embroidered
skull-cap, he shuffled restlessly from the breakfast-table to the
window, in the sitting-room above his general shop. His wife began
to clear away, with the obvious suggestion that it was her place to
make herself scarce. This was a father's duty. The boy stood
sheepishly staring out of the window. The day was going to be
scorching.</p>

<p>Of course it was his duty. It was always a father's duty. He
must be firm, admonishing, a little forensic. And all these things
came a little difficult to William. He was no orator. It was too
early in the morning. He had breakfasted well, and at the back of
his mind lurked the old hint of palliation: "Boys will be boys." He
cleared his throat and rumbled:</p>

<p>"You say pinching apples isn't stealing. You're wrong. Anything
you do becomes a habit. This is the second time Farmer James has
written to complain. That doesn't mean that it's only twice you've
stolen his apples. It means it's only twice you've been found
out."</p>

<p>"I swear it's only twice," said Tom, sulkily.</p>

<p>"That'll do. Don't answer me back. You acknowledge you stole
them. Well, what does it mean? You took what didn't belong to yer.
It's sinful. You steal apples, and it becomes a habit. Perhaps
to-morrow you steal pears, then peaches, then grapes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I've never stolen no grapes!"</p>

<p>"Be quiet, will yer! It's just a question of&mdash;one thing
leading to another. The downward path, the slippery slope,
the&mdash;er&mdash;Gadarene swine, and so on. If you take these
things p'r'aps one day you'll pinch a little money out of the
till&mdash;my till!&mdash;p'r'aps someone else's penknife,
umbreller, or whatnot. That's not the end. You're slipping down.
Stealing leads to other things&mdash;weakness, giving way all the
time. In the end, drinking, forgery, goin' to the pictures, all the
deadly sins&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Egger had re-entered the room with a brush and crumb-tray
and she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Tom's a very bad boy, William. But you needn't drag in all the
deadly sins. One doesn't need to go to hell for pinchin' a few
apples."</p>

<p>William showed annoyance. Just like Agnes&mdash;to put him on to
the job and then interfere.</p>

<p>"I tell yer&mdash;one thing leads to another," he barked.</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's no 'but' about it. Sin is sin, and once on the slippery
path, down yer go."</p>

<p>"It's not so bad as all that," replied Mrs. Egger, quickly.</p>

<p>"What I ses is&mdash;it's not nice it getting about, us with the
shop and that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh!...ugh!"</p>

<p>The whole matter might have petered out at that point, but for
the fact that, in the disturbance caused by Farmer James's letter,
Mrs. Egger had left the bacon-dish on the sideboard. On the
bacon-dish were several rinds from their breakfast. Ambling between
the window and the sideboard, Mr. Egger's attention had been
divided between this dish and a company of fowls in the yard below.
The situation was a little too embarrassing to glance at his son.
When his wife stood up in defence of the young man he pretended to
be annoyed, but he was really relieved. He had landed into this
tirade of abuse and admonition, and didn't see quite how to end
gracefully. In a moment of distraction he picked up one of the
bacon-rinds and flung it out to the fowls.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this story it is necessary to drop the
curtain on this domestic scene for the moment and follow the
adventures of the bacon-rind.</p>

<p><br>
The fowls were white leghorns, and from their appearance they fared
sumptuously. Doubtless a small general shop is a liberal found for
scraps, apart from the supply of grain which their kind demands.
But there is something about a bacon-rind that is irresistible to
nearly all living creatures. Dogs will fight to the death for it,
cats desert their kittens, birds and poultry perform prodigious
acts in the way of running, doubling, and ducking. The bacon-rind
is never safe until safely ensconced in the maw of some hungry
champion.</p>

<p>On this occasion three hens rushed at the bacon-rind, and one, a
little longer in the legs than the others, got possession. She
scampered towards the hedge, followed by seven others, clucking and
screaming. Before the hedge was reached the rind had changed
hands&mdash;beaks, rather&mdash;&mdash;three times. The original
bird had regained possession and was about to force her way through
a gap, when the cock flew from a savoury refuse heap and savagely
pecked her neck. Scandalous that a female should be allowed to
enjoy this essentially masculine luxury! There was a
rough-and-tumble in the hedge, and the cock got possession. But do
not think that he was allowed to enjoy his triumph in peace. The
fight was by no means over. So great is the appeal of bacon-rind
that the weak will attack the strong, wives will turn on their
husbands, the desperate will perform feats of valour which no other
incentive could stir them to.</p>

<p>The cock half-flew, half-ran, across the angle of the adjoining
field, followed by five of his screaming females. He knew a thing
or two, and doubled under an alder-bush and entered a narrow
coppice that ran alongside the road. But when he arrived there
three of the hens were still on his track.</p>

<p>Now it is one thing to capture a piece of bacon-rind, but quite
another thing to swallow it. The latter operation requires several
uninterrupted seconds, with the head thrown back. Even at the last
moment a rival may seize the end projecting and a fierce tug-of-war
take place. And that happened in this case. He ran and ran and ran.
He had no recollection afterwards how far he had run, but at last
he seemed to have outdistanced his pursuers. There was a moment's
respite somewhere by the side of someone's kitchen-garden. He threw
back his head, closed his eyes, and began to gulp the succulent
morsel inch by inch. Oh, the ecstasy of that oleaginous orgy! Was
there ever such a rind?</p>

<p>And then, of course, the thing happened! Someone had seized the
end just as it was disappearing, and was tugging it back
energetically. Curse! He opened his eyes and blinked. If it was one
of his own hens, he would&mdash;well, give her a very bad time.
Perhaps kill her, perhaps only neglect her. But, no! As he looked
into his rival's eyes he realized that he was up against a large
brown cock, one of the Rhode Island wretches that belonged to Mr.
Waite, the wheelwright. Venom and hatred stirred in his blood. When
this little matter of the rind was determined he would settle with
this Rhode Island upstart. He was somewhat exhausted and nearly two
inches of the rind had been reclaimed by his rival. Backwards and
forwards they swung, their feathers sticking out with sinister
promise of the real fight that was to follow. The white cock had
regained a quarter of an inch when the rind snapped. He gulped his
remaining portion, and drew back ready for the fray. Both beaks
were lowered, when suddenly the white cock beheld an approaching
terror, a large, savage mongrel dog rushing towards them. With a
scream he turned, flapped his wings, dashed through the bushes, and
left the brown cock to his fate.</p>

<p class="cpb">II</p>

<p>"Jim! Quick! Quick!" exclaimed Mrs. Waite, running out of the
cottage. Jim Waite appeared at the door of his shed, a hammer in
his hand:</p>

<p>"What is it? What's the matter, Ida?" he called out, running
towards her.</p>

<p>"That dog! That savage mongrel dog of the Beans has killed one
of our fowls! O Lordy, it's the cock, too! It's killed the
cock!"</p>

<p>"Where is it?"</p>

<p>"Look! Running across the road."</p>

<p>Jim Waite was angry. This was not the first time that mongrel
dog of the Beans had raised his ire. It always growled savagely at
him and at his wife and children. On one other occasion he had
found a fowl murdered, and he had had his suspicions.</p>

<p>He ran into the road in pursuit. The dog, scared at first by the
shouts of Mrs. Waite, had left its victim and darted under a
culvert the other side of the road. Jim bent down, picked up a
stone, flung it into the opening of the culvert, and, as chance
would have it, hit the dog on its flank. The dog became angry. It
saw red, and likewise Mr. Waite. It ran out and round him in a
circle, growling, and then made a sudden rush. Jim was a
powerfully-built man, and he brought the hammer down plomp on the
mongrel's skull. It would kill no more fowls.</p>

<p>The matter might have ended there had not Mr. Bean, the retired
corn-chandler, at that moment turned the corner in his dog-cart and
beheld Jim with the hammer in his hand, standing above the corpse
of his pet dog. Now Mr. Bean was a thin, wiry man of rather bucolic
and eccentric temper. Moreover, he had a great affection for this
most unpopular dog of indeterminate breed. Long before he reached
the group he roared out:</p>

<p>"What the devil have you done?"</p>

<p>Equally angry, Mr. Waite roared back:</p>

<p>"I've ridded the neighbourhood of this vile beast that's just
murdered my cock!"</p>

<p>"Your cock! What the devil does it matter about your cock!"</p>

<p>The dog-cart pulled up, and Mr. Bean jumped out. Before either
of the men could say another word, Mrs. Waite pointed to the other
side of the hedge and screamed:</p>

<p>"Look! Our only cock! Your blamed dog's killed it. It's always
trying to bite everyone."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean followed the direction where she was pointing. His
side-whiskers shaking, he exploded:</p>

<p>"Well, then, it was in my ground. If your cock comes into my
ground, my dog is justified in killing it."</p>

<p>"There was another cock there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Be damned to that!"</p>

<p>Mr. Waite appeared, a formidable figure towering in the road,
with the hammer in his hand, as he said, savagely:</p>

<p>"You shall pay for my cock!"</p>

<p>Nevertheless Mr. Bean replied with spirit:</p>

<p>"You shall pay for my dog!"</p>

<p>"Dog, you call it? Bah!"</p>

<p class="cpb">III</p>

<p>The attitude of both men appeared threatening, particularly as
Mr. Waite handed the hammer to his wife and began to take off his
coat. What would have been the immediate outcome is difficult to
say. But the uproar and disturbance upset the rather highly-strung
young horse, which began to trot off up the road. Mr. Bean did not
notice this till it had gone about twenty yards. Then he called
after it, but the horse took no notice. So Mr. Bean began to run.
He would probably have caught it, but a little farther on a
farmhand, late for his breakfast, came swinging down a narrow lane
into the road on a solid-tyre bicycle. He did not expect to find a
horse and trap there, and he just ducked under the horse's nose and
his back tyre struck the left shaft, and he was thrown. So far as
the horse was concerned, that put the lid on things. He put back
his ears and bolted, with Mr. Bean a kind of forlorn "also
ran."</p>

<p>The farm-hand picked up his bicycle and swore. Jim Waite picked
up the dead dog, and flung it into Mr. Bean's strip of land. Mrs.
Waite picked up the dead cock, and muttering to Mr. Waite: "Well,
we'd meant to kill this week, anyway," she took it inside and
plucked it while it was warm.</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was a good runner, and he tore down the road, yelling:
"Stop him! Stop him!"</p>

<p>He had lost his dog, and the prospect of losing his horse also
spurred him on. But a young horse, even encumbered by a dog-cart,
can run faster than the fastest man. The distance between them
widened. He could see the dogcart swaying and swerving, but the
horse stuck to the road. Mr. Bean ran over half a mile. It was a
deserted part of the country, and nothing passed him. The horse and
cart were out of sight. He rested for a few moments, and then ran
on. When he had travelled about another four hundred yards he
beheld a group of dark objects at the angle of two narrow roads.
For some moments he could not distinguish what they were, but his
instinct told him that something had happened. On approaching
nearer, he beheld a large car, apparently jammed into the
embankment by the side of the road; his dog-cart appeared to be
hugging its mudguards. Two of three figures were moving about, but
there was no sign of the horse. He rushed up, panting. When within
hailing distance, he called out:</p>

<p>"What's up? What's happened? Where's my horse?"</p>

<p class="cpb">IV</p>

<p>Three busy men turned and regarded him. One was a young
chauffeur. The other two were a curious contrast: a tall,
white-moustached man of the Indian Army type, and a thin, aesthetic
young man in the early twenties.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Bean was in the mood when the great thing he needed in
life was sympathy. He was having a bad morning. It was therefore an
unpleasant shock to have the white-moustached gentleman turn on him
in a blaze of anger and exclaim:</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you? What the devil do you mean, letting your
damned horse and trap rush about the country? My God! you've
buckled both our front wheels, and I've a most important
appointment in forty minutes in Hornborough."</p>

<p>"Where's my horse?" wailed Mr. Bean. "I got out of the trap for
a moment, and he bolted."</p>

<p>"What the devil did you get out of the trap for?" roared the
stentorian individual. The younger man grinned and said,
casually:</p>

<p>"Your horse is all right, old boy. He's trotting about in the
meadow yonder, eating lotus-leaves."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean climbed up the embankment and looked over; and, sure
enough, there was the horse, two hundred yards down the meadow,
nibbling grass in the intervals of staring nervously around. He did
not appear damaged at all, but the left shaft of the dog-cart was
snapped at the base and the wheel badly twisted. Mr. Bean, however,
was not allowed to devote too much attention to his own troubles.
The elder man, whom he heard the other address as "General,"
ordered him down in such a commanding way that he had not the power
to disobey.</p>

<p>"Now, my man, listen to me," roared the parade-ground voice.
"How far is it to Hornborough?"</p>

<p>"Nine miles," replied Mr. Bean, almost involuntarily adding
"sir."</p>

<p>"God!" said the General. "And where is the nearest place we can
get a car?"</p>

<p>"There isn't a garage nearer than Hornborough that I know
of."</p>

<p>"Isn't there anyone in this God-forsaken part of the country who
has got a car?"</p>

<p>"Only Sir Samuel Lemby, and I know he's motored up to town
to-day."</p>

<p>"God!" repeated the General, and, turning to the younger man, he
said: "What the devil are we going to do, my lord?"</p>

<p>It occurred to Mr. Bean that the younger man, addressed as "my
lord," was vaguely amused. He scratched his chin and said:</p>

<p>"It looks like a wash-out, unless we walk, General."</p>

<p>"Walk! Nine miles in forty minutes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we could hire bicycles."</p>

<p>"Bicycles."</p>

<p>The General's face was a study in stupefied outrage. He turned
to Mr. Bean and exclaimed: "Are there no traps about here!"</p>

<p>"Plenty, sir," answered Mr. Bean, who by this time had
completely succumbed to the overwhelming atmosphere of a general
and a lord. "But no trap could do nine miles in forty minutes."</p>

<p>"But what the devil are we to do? The Minister can't wait. The
train won't wait. The House sits at two."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was enormously impressed. He felt personally
responsible for some mysterious national disaster. He said, weakly:
"I don't know, sir. It's very awkward."</p>

<p>Then a bright inspiration occurred to him. "A racehorse could do
it. Sir Samuel Lemby has race-horses, but he's away, and it's not
likely the head-groom would lend any out for such a purpose."</p>

<p>The eyes of the General started out of his head.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't, wouldn't he? How far is it to this Lemby's?"</p>

<p>"There's the house, just up there, sir. Five minutes'</p>

<p class="cpb">V</p>

<p>The General appeared to be calculating savagely. At last he
turned to the younger man and said:</p>

<p>"Gevennah, it's our only chance. You could do this. You rode in
the Grand National. What you don't know about horses isn't worth
knowing. For God's sake run up the hill. Cajole, bribe,
steal&mdash;do anything to get the horse. Five minutes, say another
five minutes arguing&mdash;half an hour to do nine miles. Perhaps
you can get across country, save a bit, eh? There's just a chance.
The train goes at twelve-thirty-two. Oxted is bound to catch
it."</p>

<p>The young man's face lighted up. A queer smile twisted his
mouth.</p>

<p>"All right," he said. "I'll have a shot. Give me the
report."</p>

<p>"Here it is. I'll follow you up the hill as fast as I can move,
in case they want more persuading."</p>

<p>Mr. Bean was left alone with the useless car and the broken
dog-cart. He saw the younger man sprinting up the hill like a
professional runner, and the elder chasing after him like some
valetudinarian crank trying to keep his fat down.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, the younger man came slap on the
head-groom and a subordinate leading two silk-coated mares out of
the paddock for a canter. He approached the head-groom and
smiled.</p>

<p>"My friend," he said, "I'm going to ask you to break all the Ten
Commandments in one fell swoop. I am Lord Gevennah, a lover of
horseflesh and metaphysics. The gentleman yon observe coming up the
hill is not training for the Marathon. He is General Boyd-Boyd, of
the War Office Intelligence Staff. You may suggest that War Office
and intelligence are a contradiction in terms, but we have not time
to argue the matter. The point is. Sir Samuel is a very old friend
of the General's and we are convinced that he would come to our
rescue in the circumstances."</p>

<p>The head-groom leant forward and said: "Excuse me, sir, but
would you mind telling me what you're talking about?"</p>

<p>"A very reasonable request. Farther down the hill, at the
cross-roads, you may also observe a car jammed against the
embankment. Both the front wheels are buckled. It is essential that
we deliver a report&mdash;this report, my friend&mdash;to Sir
Alfred Oxted, the Minister. He is catching the twelve-thirty-two
train at Hornborough for London. The report affects the whole
aspect of the argument affecting a Bill that is being discussed in
the House this afternoon."</p>

<p>"What is it you want me to do, sir?"</p>

<p>"I want the loan of that beautiul roan mare which for the moment
your figure so gracefully adorns, for the purpose of riding to
Hornborough."</p>

<p>"What! Lend you one of Sir Samuel's racers!"</p>

<p>"Precisely, my friend."</p>

<p>"Not on your dear life! Lend you Iconoclast to go monkeying
about the high roads on! Why, it's more than my place is
worth."</p>

<p>"Is your place worth more than the interests of the
people&mdash;the vital necessities of the nation?"</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it. I work for Sir Samuel Lemby. If you
get his permission&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We have his permission&mdash;morally. He is one of the
General's oldest friends."</p>

<p>"I've only got your word for it. Sir Samuel paid four thousand
seven hundred and fifty for this mare. It can't be done."</p>

<p>"Come! this is quibbling; time is precious. The General said we
should waste five minutes arguing. But if you will kindly dismount,
I shall still have half-an-hour to get to Hornborough. I promise to
bring the mare back safely."</p>

<p>"It can't be done, my son. For all I know the whole thing may be
a cock-and-bull story."</p>

<p>"Ah! here comes the General. General, I'm afraid our friend
demands security."</p>

<p>"Well, for God's sake give it to him. What the devil does he
think we are?"</p>

<p>"Produce everything you've got, General. Pocket-book, money,
despatches. I will do the same."</p>

<p>The head-groom beheld wallets of notes being produced, and he
became frankly interested. In the end he accepted a bribe of two
hundred and twenty-five pounds in cash for the loan of Iconoclast
for one hour.</p>

<p>"It's an awful risk," he said, dismally, as he dismounted.</p>

<p>"If you do not take risks you will never arrive," replied the
young man, leaping into the saddle. "Without taking risks great
battles would not have been won, colonies founded, discoveries
made. Iconoclast! an excellent name! Come, old friend! Iconoclast,
breaker of idols, shatterer of illusions, trusted enemy to false
prophets! Come!"</p>

<p>He pressed the mare's flanks gently with his knees, and she
responded.</p>

<p>"Only twenty-nine minutes!" roared the General.</p>

<p>The young man turned a laughing face and waved his hand. His
progress was visible to the anxious General's eye for nearly half a
mile. The narrow road flanked a sixty-acre field and led into a
bridle-path through a chain of little coppices. By taking this
bridle-path, the head-groom had explained that he would save a mile
or two, as well as the horse's feet. The last they saw of him, he
appeared to be leaning over, whispering in the mare's ear.
Iconoclast was travelling like the wind.</p>

<p>It was certainly a very beautiful ride. The bridle-path, which
once had been a Roman road, ran for nearly six miles in almost a
dead straight line. The ground was gently undulating. Woods flashed
by, and open spaces, commons with sparse trees, sandy cuttings with
gorse and furze projecting at tantalizing angles, stretches of blue
distance with cattle grazing, sleepy rivers. On, on, raced this
famous offspring of Babylon and Happy Days (you shall read of her
in Borwell's <i>History of the Turf</i>).</p>

<p>The young man's face was alight with pleasure. Occasionally he
slackened the mare's speed to glance at his wrist-watch. When the
road was reached there were three miles to go, and twelve minutes
to accomplish it. Iconoclast had justified her good name.</p>

<p>"Steady, now, old girl, steady! We're reaching the stormy
outposts of Christian gentlemen."</p>

<p>A sign-post pointed eastward to Hornborough. Fortunately the
road was still what is known as a secondary road. A few cars
flashed by, their drivers a little nervous of this bolting
apparition of man and beast. Hay-carts lumbering leisurely out of
fields were the serious source of danger, men on bicycles, market
carts, all the slow-moving things.</p>

<p>Twelve minutes, eleven minutes, ten&mdash;the road sloping
upwards violently to the headland that looks down on the Horn
valley.</p>

<p>Nine minutes, eight and a half, eight&mdash;the summit reached.
Down below, the sleepy valley, almost impervious to the thrusts of
time. Thus it must have looked in Boadicea's time. A few more
hamlets, a few more cultivated fields.</p>

<p>"Whoa up, old girl!"</p>

<p>The signboard said one and a quarter miles to Horn-borough
Station. One mile and a quarter, and eight minutes to go! His
faith! a worthy beast, this Iconoclast! One mile and a quarter, and
all the way a gentle slope downward. If ever there was a pleasant
sporting prospect, here was one. To travel at the rate so far
maintained would bring the horse and rider to their destination
with some minutes to spare. Away on the horizon appeared tiny white
balls of smoke, like little lumps of cotton-wool being shot out of
a toy gun. It was the train. He again consulted his wrist-watch and
estimated the distance. "It's four minutes late!" he exclaimed, a
shade of disappointment in his voice. It would appear, in any case,
not an occasion to tarry. One mile and a quarter, and twelve
minutes to go. But, curiously enough, the young man seemed in no
hurry. He tethered the mare to a gate, on the top bar of which he
perched himself, and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"A glorious ride, Iconoclast, old friend!" he said, stroking the
mare's nozzle. He appeared to be making a careful calculation, his
eyes wandering from the little blobs of cotton-wool to his watch.
After some minutes he flung his cigarette away, and again took to
the saddle. The last mile and a quarter was done at express speed,
but certainly not at the greatest speed of which the mare was
capable. The rider seemed a little agitated by some meticulous
calculation. Some of the road was covered in whirlwind fashion, but
there were unaccountable slackenings and halts.</p>

<p>When the little market town of Hornborough was reached, the
blobs of cotton-wool arrived simultaneously. There was a furious
ride along the broad High Street, terrifying the owners of booths
and stalls. Shopkeepers ran to their doors, women clutched their
children, and dogs barked. But horse and rider swung round the
corner into Church Street, dashed across Ponder's Green, up the
slope into the station-yard, and arrived <i>just as the train went
out</i>! The whole town must have observed that dramatic ride and
commented on it. A young man, on one of Sir Samuel's
race-horses&mdash;some said it was Iconoclast herself&mdash;racing
to the station to catch the London train&mdash;why?</p>

<p class="cpb">VI</p>

<p>He flung the reins to an outside porter, and dashed into the
station and on to the platform.</p>

<p>"The train has just gone, sir," exclaimed the ticket-collector,
grinning. It may be observed, at this juncture, that there is a
type of individual who loves to impart information of this kind. He
loves to tell you you have just missed your train, or that you are
in the wrong train, or that there isn't another one for four hours.
His supreme idea of joy is to be able to tell you that you have
just missed your last train. It isn't nice.</p>

<p>On this occasion our hero&mdash;for so he surely must
be&mdash;merely muttered the formal exclamations of disappointment,
and then went back and remounted his steed, after flinging the
improvised groom a purse of gold. (No, if we remember rightly, it
was a shilling.) Anyway, he galloped back through the town for all
the world to see.</p>

<p>Instead, however, of returning the way he had come, he bore off
to the west and, after ten minutes' ride, cantered up the chestnut
avenue that led to a Georgian house. In the circular drive in front
of the entrance-hall he espied a butler taking a parrot in a cage
out for an airing. He called out:</p>

<p>"Hi, Fareweather, can you hold my mare for five minutes? I can't
stop. Is Miss Alice in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, my lord. With pleasure, my lord. She's in the Dutch
garden, watering the gentians."</p>

<p>Ah! watering the gentians! How like Alice! The Dutch garden was
excellent. It had the added charm of being sunk.</p>

<p>The girl looked up at him with that dreamy,
does-any-thing-else-exist-but-thou-and-I expression, and he crushed
her in his arms. These preliminaries being concluded, she said:</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>And appropriately enough he answered:</p>

<p>"There's a destiny which shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we
will!"</p>

<p>"You look as though you had just invented a new religion."</p>

<p>"And so I have, but I haven't had time to patent it. This
afternoon the Government will fall, and it will be my work.
Religion and opportunity are old bedfellows."</p>

<p>"Tell me."</p>

<p>"You know the storm that has raged round the Subsidies Bill. It
has been working to a crisis. The Government have staked their all
on squashing the amendment which our people are putting this
afternoon. A delicate subject like this is largely a question of
figures. Figures can be impressive, but a clever man can use them
either way. That is what they've been doing. They have the control
end of statistics, and statistics can be wangled. Over the week-end
I was at Clive Hall. I was supposed to be there for polo, but I
found myself in a mare's nest of conspirators and wanglers.
Brigadiers and carpet-salesmen, they've been all over the country,
drawing up a report."</p>

<p>"Is it a false report, Mervyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and no. A report can be false not so much by what it says
as by what it leaves out. See? This was a devilish, wanglish,
naughty, spiteful report, and they were going to spring it on the
House this afternoon, to crush our people's amendment. I didn't
show my hand. I'm only a polo player. I was full of sympathy. A
chutney-biting brigadier named Boyd-Boyd fixed an appointment on
the 'phone with Oxted, at Hornborough Station, for the
twelve-thirty-two. Fie was to deliver the goods. I offered to
accompany him, making the excuse that I had to go to town. Cyril
lent us his car. We had got as far as some God-forsaken spot in the
Weynesham Valley. I was desperate. I couldn't make up my mind
whether to dot the old chap over the head and bolt or whether to
pinch the report and let it blow away, when fate supervened."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"A horse in a dog-cart bolted. The fool of a man had got out for
some reason or other. In trying to avoid it, our chauffeur ran into
a bank, and buckled both the front wheels. We had nine miles to go,
and there wasn't such a thing as a car in the neighbourhood. The
old Purple Patch nearly went off his nut. Then some magician
produced a race-horse."</p>

<p>"A race-horse?"</p>

<p>"Wasn't it sweet? I jumped at the idea. I knew that it would be
up to me to do the flying handicap stuff, and with the report once
in my possession all would be well. I rode hell-for-leather, and
missed the train gracefully by a minute."</p>

<p>"But what will you do with the report?"</p>

<p>"Give it back. It doesn't matter. It will be too late. Figures
like that are only useful when used at the right moment. To-morrow
the Government will be down, and no one will care a rap about their
blinking old report."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear! I'm glad I don't have anything to do with
politics."</p>

<p>"You do. You are politics. You are what we fight for, and lie
for, and wangle for. You are religion. You are beauty. Haven't you
heard the saying: <i>Homo solus aut deus aut demon?</i> You are the
rose in the heart of the world. You&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Talking about roses, Mervyn, how do you like my gentians?"</p>

<p>"There you go! You always spoil my best periods. Darling, one
kiss and I must away."</p>

<p>"Whither, O Lord?"</p>

<p>"To take the mare back, and face the fury of my bonny
brigadier."</p>

<p>"He <i>will</i> be angry!"</p>

<p>"What does it matter? Did you ever know a brigadier who
mattered? When the big story is told, you'll find he's about as
important as a&mdash;as a&mdash;piece of bacon-rind!"</p>

<p class="cpb">VII</p>

<p>"You didn't ought to have talked to the boy like that," said
Mrs. Egger, as she poured out Mr. Egger's glass of stout at
suppertime. "It's set the boy on thinking; and when a boy like Tom
starts thinking it's&mdash;it's&mdash;bad for his health."</p>

<p>"I like that," replied William, blowing the froth off the stout.
"Why, it was you put me up to it. Didn't you say&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"I told yer to give him a good scolding. It would have been
better if you'd boxed his ears. Instead of all this talk."</p>

<p>"What talk?"</p>

<p>"Saying one thing leads to another, and so on."</p>

<p>"Well, isn't it true?"</p>

<p>"In a kind of way it's true. In a kind of way it's silly.
Anyway, it sets him on thinking. I saw him in the shop this
afternoon staring at them cooking-pears. I know he was thinking
about what you said. Now if he took apples to-day, he might take
pears to-morrow. It put the notion there, like. He'd never have
thought of it. And this evenin' he comes up to me and says, 'Mum,
dad said one thing leads to another,' and I says, 'Yes, Tom?' and
he says, 'Mum, what was the first thing from which the other things
come?' Did you ever hear such notions? Pass the pickles, dear."</p>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. THE MOTHER OF CARMEN
COLIGNON</h2>

<p class="cpb">I</p>

<p>If one Sunday morning you wander up the Rue Cadec in Montmartre
and lose yourself in the picturesque confusion of the market in
that narrow fairway&mdash;or perhaps you may have to go a little
further afield, round the corner in the Rue des Abesses&mdash;in
any case, in one of these delightful streets you are almost bound
to meet a very old lady who is always an object of universal
interest. She is very old, fragile, and bent. She leans for support
upon a stout hickory stick. In the other hand she carries a string
bag, revealing her modest purchases of leeks, <i>salsifis</i>,
bread, fish,' and candles. She appears to be a very popular figure
in the market. The men touch their hats and smile friendlily. The
women call out:</p>

<p>"Good morning, maman. May God preserve you!"</p>

<p>And her face lights up with an enchanting smile that is in some
queer way younger than her body. It is the smile of a young and
simple soul, easily flattered, sensitive to affection or
indifference. Antiquity has a beauty of its own. When all the
passions are dim memories, all the discords inaudible, all the
memories themselves mellowed by long years of serene detachment,
the face takes on an expression of spiritual beauty that makes one
wonder whether the owner were half so beautiful in the lambent
years of youth.</p>

<p>Now if you are a stranger, and you ask one of the habitués of
the market:</p>

<p>"Who is the dear old lady?"</p>

<p>You will receive a reply given eagerly and proudly:</p>

<p>"Oh, that? Don't you know, monsieur, that is the mother of
Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" you may reply, "and who is, or was, Carmen
Colignon?"</p>

<p>And then a most curious thing happens. Your fellow marketer
looks a little bewildered. If it is a man he probably tilts his hat
on one side and scratches his head behind the ear. If a woman, she
probably taps her cheek with a large latch-key, and then pouts and
shakes her head. But whichever sex your marketer may be, you will
assuredly get some such answer as this:</p>

<p>"Eh? H'm! Well, now, since you mention it, monsieur, upon my
soul I couldn't rightly tell you at the moment. Carmen Colignon?
Well, yes, she was&mdash;what was she? A singer? An actress? It has
escaped my memory. But that is her mother, I assure you, monsieur.
We always address her as such, "the mother of Carmen
Colignon.'"</p>

<p>Well, well, what would you? The life of the streets, the life of
the boulevards&mdash;indeed, all life is a fluid business. It flows
past us, leaving a trail of fading memories, impressing upon us one
central fact&mdash;that fame is a transitory thing, but that love
and beauty have an endurance of their own.</p>

<p class="cpb">II</p>

<p>Near the village of Cambo-les-Bains, at the foot of the
Pyrenees, there dwelt a small farmer named Raymond Marcillac with
his two sons and two daughters. He was regarded as a queer old
fish, taciturn and reserved, and somewhat quick-tempered, a
difficult man to know. After twenty years of a somewhat fractious
married life his wife had died. Monsieur and Madame Marcillac had
never been on the best of terms. She was a chicken-headed woman,
used to city life, and she had never adapted herself to the farm.
She was, moreover, considerably younger than her husband. Monsieur
Marcillac was now fifty-three, and one might have predicted that
the lamp of romance would have respectably guttered and died out.
But oh, dear, no! There came to Cambo a widow named Goud-chaux, who
was a consumptive, and her daughter, Honorine. They stayed at a
little sanatorium just adjoining the farm. Calling there one day to
deliver some butter, he chanced to meet the daughter, Honorine, in
the garden. He got into conversation with her. No one knows what
was said on either side, but immediately after the visit the
neighbours noted a striking and significant change in Monsieur
Marcillac. His unkempt beard was trimmed. He scrubbed his hands and
face at least twice a day. He bought a new suit and some smart
boots. He made curious noises at his work, which some declared to
be singing. And every day he made some excuse for calling at the
sanatorium.</p>

<p>Six months later he married Honorine Goudchaux, who was then in
her twenty-seventh year. Her mother had died, and she went to live
at the farm with Monsieur Marcillac and his two sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>It is difficult to discover what attraction the uncouth farmer,
who was twice her age, could have had for Honorine. But there!
these things do happen, and sometimes happen quite satisfactorily.
She was a tall woman, rather clumsily built; a simple soul,
refined, sensitive, and though by no means handsome, she had a
certain appealing charm by virtue of her transparent sincerity and
honesty of outlook. She loved her husband, and she made him a
devoted wife. All might have been well but for the children of
Monsieur Marcillac.</p>

<p>The two girls, Jeanne and Louise, were now respectively sixteen
and eighteen. They had been badly brought up. Their mother had
either neglected or spoilt them, and since her death they had lived
a life of idleness and indulgence. They naturally resented the
intrusion of this interloper, who was not only going to monopolise
their father's afiections but his property and savings. The sons
also resented it, but they were of less consequence in the affair,
as shortly afterwards they both married, and one went into the com
chandler's profession at Bayonne, whilst the other went to live on
an adjoining farm.</p>

<p class="cpb">III</p>

<p>These two daughters of Monsieur Marcillac soon set to work to
make their stepmother's life a misery. Coldly polite to her before
their father, they tyrannised her directly his back was turned. And
she was a good subject for tyranny, being sensitive and
warm-hearted. She did her utmost to be friendly to the girls, but
all her advances were repulsed. They sneered at her and mimicked
her, and saw to it that all the heavy work of the farmhouse fell
upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>After the early repulses she accepted the situation with
complacency. She was not unhappy. She worked hard and cheerfully,
and always met her husband with a bright smile. She said nothing to
him about the way his daughters treated her. And he, poor man,
sensed nothing of the antagonism. His daughters feared him. He had
an uncompromising way of dealing with disobedience and disrespect,
a way in which physical force was strikingly evident.</p>

<p>His new wife delighted him. When his day's work was done, he
would return to the house, and the family would sup together.
Afterwards he and his wife would sit out in the garden side by
side. They were not a talkative couple. Honorine seemed to be
satisfied just to be by his side, mending his socks or making up a
frock. Monsieur Marcillac would smoke his pipe and read the
newspaper. Sometimes he would put the paper down and talk to her
about the prospects of root crops, or the prices pigs were fetching
in the market at Biarritz. And Honorine would be enchanted. At
night beautiful dreams would come to her. In the twilight hour
between sleeping and waking she would be conscious of a mysterious
outflow of intense happiness...</p>

<p>The child was born the following year, and what a to-do there
was! Monsieur Marcillac was overjoyed. There was a baptism and a
feast, and the little girl was called Yvonne.</p>

<p>Now if the two daughters resented the intrusion of the mother,
the arrival of Yvonne added gall to their bitterness. Apart from
the importunacy of the "squealing brat"&mdash;as they called
it&mdash;it soldified the mother's side of the affair, and caused
the withdrawal from the work of the farmhouse of its most active
and efficient helper.</p>

<p>Monsieur Marcillac, moreover, quickly showed that of all his
children this was to be the favourite. He was for ever hovering
over the cot and nursing the little mite in his arms.</p>

<p>This strange household functioned without any outward hint of
cleavage for five years. It takes two parties to make a quarrel,
and Honorine refused to quarrel. She submitted to every kind of
insult and gibe. In only one particular did she assert her right
and authority&mdash;the child. She knew she could not trust the two
girls. They were capable of any criminal act. One day Louise
smacked Yvonne for no other reason than that she was crying.
Honorine flew at her and pushed her into a corner; then picking up
a carving fork she said, in accents the passionate quality of which
could not be misunderstood:</p>

<p>"If you ever touch my child again I will kill you."</p>

<p>Yvonne was left alone after that, but the mother was treated
more cruelly than ever. At five years of age Yvonne was a beautiful
child, quick and vivacious, with bright malicious eyes. Louise
became engaged to a small tenant farmer named Bartholomé
Ombrédanne. Soon, perhaps she would marry and go away&mdash;Jeanne
also. Everything would turn out well; Honorine held her course. In
any case they could not destroy her dreams...</p>

<p>And then one morning Monsieur Marcillac complained of a sore
foot. He had trodden on a rusty spike a few days previously and had
neglected it. A doctor was fetched. The wound was treated, and he
was ordered to stay in bed for several days. He did, indeed, stay
in bed for one day, but the next morning he awoke at dawn and said
to his wife:</p>

<p>"Honorine, my angel, who is taking those calves to the market at
Biarritz?"</p>

<p>"Jacques, beloved."</p>

<p>"Jacques! A pretty dolt to handle such a deal. He'll sell the
lot for a capful of sous."</p>

<p>And without more ado he rose from his bed. Honorine protested,
cajoled, and even wept, but she could not dissuade him. He
struggled into his clothes, limped down into the yard, saddled the
mare, got the calves roped into the cart, and drove off.</p>

<p>He returned early in the afternoon. His face was white, and he
was suffering great pain. Honorine got him to bed, and the doctor
was fetched. Everything that local knowledge, science, and skill
could do was done, but Monsieur Marcillac died within forty-eight
hours from blood-poisoning.</p>

<p class="cpb">IV</p>

<p>It was some weeks before Madame Marcillac recovered from the
first shock of her great grief. When she was once more able to
guage the measure of her working life, she found herself facing a
formidable situation. Monsieur Marcillac had made a will. It was a
most elaborate will, displaying that relish for meticulous detail
which is so characteristic of the French peasant. It might have
been the will of some huge landed proprietor rather than that of a
small peasant farmer. He had evidently devoted a lot of thought to
it. In effect, it amounted to the direction that the farm was to be
held in trust for Yvonne. Honorine,</p>

<p>the eldest son, and Monsieur Ombredanne were appointed trustees.
The bulk of the profits were to go to Honorine during her lifetime.
At the same time a share of the profits was to go to his two
daughters, who were to be allowed to remain at the farmhouse, and
who he trusted would always treat his wife and her child with
"Christian devotion and affection." It was further decreed that
Monsieur Ombredanne was to be appointed overseer at a fixed salary.
He left various small sums of money to his sons and friends, and
the furniture to his wife.</p>

<p>One day the son, together with Ombredanne, and a notary named
Pironneau, arrived to discuss the arrangements about the execution
of the will and the future conduct of the farm. Honorine was called
in, but they hardly addressed her. They talked animatedly about
legal terms which she did not understand. This Ombredanne was an
insolent, good-looking, youngish man, with a fair beard, large
flashing eyes, and slightly protruding teeth.</p>

<p>It was not till some time later that she realised that the
salary fixed for the overseer was considerably in excess of what
the small farm would stand. It was equally apparent that these
three men were hand in glove. She signed all the documents set
before her. And the realisation came too late that until Yvonne
came of age she was to be little more than an underpaid drudge. She
was tied to the farm, committed to live with the two sisters, and
was entirely in the hands of Ombredanne and the others so far as
finance was concerned.</p>

<p>She bowed to the situation for the sake of her child. Nothing
mattered provided little Yvonne had all that she required. And the
farm certainly supplied that. There was always milk and eggs, and
butter and bacon. But when it came to money&mdash;that was a
different story. There was machinery to buy, a barn to be
re-roofed, seeds and meal to be bought&mdash;Monsieur Marcillac had
been apparently very negligent. At the end of the first quarter it
was explained to her that the farm had made no profit at all. She
wanted money for clothes and boots both for herself and the child.
There was much shaking of heads, much elaborate explanation. Ah!
no, Madame Marcillac must wait. Perhaps after the harvest.</p>

<p>During the whole period of Ombredanne's overseership she never
managed to get out of him more than a few hundred francs a year.
She was forced to go shabby, to cut up clothes to make things for
the child, to slop about the house in old shoes. It would not have
been so bad&mdash;there was a fierce exaltation in the sense of
self-sacrifice for her little one&mdash;if only...She could
sometimes hear their cruel laughter, their whispers together, and
then Jeanne and Louise would go out smartly dressed, and they would
go for drives in the governess cart with Ombrédanne, and visit
travelling booths and fairs. After a decent period&mdash;for they
are very strict in those parts about the etiquette of
grief&mdash;it was announced that Louise and Ombredanne were going
to get married. It was also put to her, without equivocation, that
the room she occupied was far too large for a single person. It was
the only room in the house suitable to a married couple. Times had
changed, etc.</p>

<p>Well, well, little Yvonne was nearly six, and could run and
talk. There was no reason why she should not be happy in the room
above. It would be in any case farther out of the sound and
influence of the others. And so she gave up her bridal chamber and
moved up to the attic with her child. She was expected to do the
cooking and most of the housework, as well as attend to the poultry
and make and mend clothing for herself and Yvonne. And yet she
found happiness in all this. The sun would come aslant through the
open doorway, and she would peep out and behold visions of green
maize through a trellis of pollard oak trees, and down below the
pale blue ribbon of the Nive creeping from between the shoulders of
majestic hills. And in her heart she sang as she took little Yvonne
to the village school in the morning, and listened to her prattle
when they returned hand in hand across the fields in the evening.
She was a mother.</p>

<p class="cpb">V</p>

<p>As the years advanced her antipathies to the Ombre-danne
farmstead&mdash;he had now established himself as the
master&mdash;became finer and more acute. They were less coloured
by physical and material issues than by spiritual ones. Monsieur
Ombredanne was unscrupulous and selfish, but he was not altogether
a cad and a bully. He was rather seduced by the attractiveness of
Yvonne, who was indeed a fascinating child. He would sometimes
spoil her&mdash;give her sweets that were bad for her, pinch her
cheeks, and call her a little "bagful of sunshine." Sometimes he
would drink brandy and be loose in his conversation; he would say
things that bewildered and confused the child. The two sisters
showed no signs of living down their animosity. They seemed to
exult in saying unkind and improper things to Honorine in her
little daughter's presence, and the child was beginning to
understand. Something would have to be done.</p>

<p>One day she went to see the notary, Pironneau. With considerable
trepidation she unfolded her plan. The furniture had been left her
by her husband. She wished to sell it, and with the proceeds go to
another part of the country with her daughter. Monsieur Pironneau
put on his steel-rimmed spectacles and regarded her critically. He
then produced the papers relating to the estate. Placing a blue
form before her, he said laconically:</p>

<p>"You must have forgotten, Madame Marcillac, that you signed this
paper agreeing not to sell the furniture until your daughter
inherits the property."</p>

<p>She shrank from his unfriendly glance. "Yes, I had
forgotten."</p>

<p>Going back across the fields she heard a lark singing at some
invisible altitude. Apple blossoms were beginning to fall. Spring
was merging into summer.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my little one," she murmured, "a way shall be
found."</p>

<p>Nevertheless she remained two years more at the farm. And then
Louise had a baby, and Monsieur Ombrédanne drank more brandy and
sometimes became quarrelsome, and coarser and looser in his
behaviour; and Jeanne became more cantankerous because a young man
had made love to her, and then deserted her for another. And so one
day Honorine packed up her few small possessions and went away with
her daughter.</p>

<p class="cpb">VI</p>

<p>She obtained a situation at one of the little hotels catering
for invalids. It was seven miles from Cambo, on the outskirts of a
tiny village. The patron agreed to let her have the child, and they
slept in a room above the stables. Honorine's work began at six and
did not finish till the establishment closed at night, but she was
used to long hours. She had to scrub and scour, and wash the
saucepans and the blankets, in fact do all the heavy work of the
establishment, but it brought with it a sense of elation and
freedom. The patron soon realised her worth and was fairly kind and
considerate towards her. Yvonne went to the village school, and
played in the garden and learnt her lessons in a loft, where
Honorine strove to mould her mind, and night and morning they would
pray side by side. She was happier than at any time since her
husband's death. Sometimes she would awake abruptly at dawn, as
though caressed by invisible and loving arms, and she would
think:</p>

<p>"Why am I so happy?"</p>

<p>And she could not account for it. She would rise hastily and
make Yvonne's chocolate, and prepare eagerly for her day's work.
Perhaps she was happy because life is beautiful, and because her
own was directed by a singleness of purpose-love for her child. It
made her happy to make clothes for Yvonne when she herself was
tired to darn afid sew for her, to teach her and humour her,' to
suffer for her wilfulness.</p>

<p>And as the years passed she found that the occasions increased
when Yvonne made her suffer. She was spoilt at school, spoilt by
the visitors to the hotel, spoilt by neighbours and strangers. She
was already conscious of her prettiness and charm.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac only partially realised this. Whatever faults
Yvonne might have, her mother took the blame upon herself. Neither
could she endure for an instant the little bursts of anger and
petulance when Yvonne was thwarted in her desires.</p>

<p>They stayed at this hotel for four years, and then Madame
Marcillac decided to make a change. She had saved up several
hundred francs, and she did not feel that Yvonne was getting the
opportunities for study and improvement which she might get in a
town.</p>

<p>They went to Biarritz, and took one room in a back street. Every
day she went out to work, and in the evening did sewing and
cleaning, or anything that came along. Nevertheless, she found life
here more precarious and harder. Everything was more expensive,
including Yvonne's education and the little extra luxuries she
increasingly demanded. At the end of the first year she had saved
nothing, and her daughter was clamouring for greater comforts. She
was of course incapable of understanding the situation. She mixed
with children in a better state of life, and she instinctively
nurtured a grudge against her mother because she did not supply her
with the luxuries these other children had.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac struggled on. She worked late into the night
when Yvonne was asleep. She worked till her health gave way. She
would probably have worked herself into an early grave, but one day
she had a stroke of fortune. A neighbour brought her a Paris
newspaper in which was an advertisement by a firm of lawyers asking
for information regarding the whereabouts or existence of Honorine
Goudchaux, daughter of the late Monsieur and Madame Henri
Goudchaux. She wrote to the lawyers, who replied that if she were
indeed the individual advertised for, it would be worth her while
to go to Paris and interview them. Paris! But what a journey! What
an expense! How was it to be done? Could she endure the separation
from Yvonne?</p>

<p>But the same neighbour, having a shrewd suspicion that the money
would be well invested, offered to advance her her expenses.</p>

<p>And so one day, with much misgiving and heartburning over this
first separation from her beloved child, she set out for Paris
alone. The expedition was entirely satisfactory. She found the
lawyers and proved her identity. It appeared that her mother's
brother, who had lived in Athens and was in the currant trade, had
died intestate. He was unmarried, and Honorine was the only living
relative. The fortune he left, carefully invested, would bring her
in approximately twelve thousand francs a year.</p>

<p class="cpb">VII</p>

<p>On receipt of this news she felt bewildered and somewhat
apprehensive, as though she were appropriating something which by
rights belonged to others. And then suddenly she thought of Yvonne.
Yvonne! This meant clothes, presents, education, joy for Yvonne.
Comfort and security for ever, a dot on her marriage. Tears came
into her eyes as she thanked the lawyers.</p>

<p>When she returned to Biarritz her health broke down. She went to
Yvonne and flung her arms round her and kissed her, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Little one, everything is going to be better for you. You are
going to have frocks and better food, and a nice place to live in,
and a nice school, and everything you wish."</p>

<p>And then she trembled and burst into tears. She was obliged to
go to bed and remain there for many days. She could neither eat nor
sleep. A doctor came and gave her a powerful sleeping draught.</p>

<p>"You must have a long rest," he said, "you have been working too
hard."</p>

<p>The mother and daughter stayed in Biarritz for four more years.
At first the income seemed prodigious. She had no idea how far it
would go. But she quickly found that there was very little over
after they had moved to better quarters and she had paid for
Yvonne's schooling and her singing lessons and her multiplying
extravagances. The child was very advanced for her years. At the
age of sixteen she was already a woman, in many ways more
sophisticated than her mother. She could dance and sing, and look
at a man with that malicious gleam which predicates the
<i>cocotte</i>. But Honorine saw' nothing of this. Yvonne was
beyond all criticism.</p>

<p>One day she came to her mother and said:</p>

<p>"Maman, I am tired of this poky little town. Let us go and live
in Paris."</p>

<p>Paris! Why should they go and live in Paris? Honorine had got to
love this country, this little white town, the blue rolling waves
dancing against the rocks, the bold outline of the distant
Pyrenees, the happy Basque people in their native dress, the
tamarisks and eucalyptus trees. Paris! She sighed a little, knowing
that Yvonne would have her way.</p>

<p>And so it proved, for the following autumn the mother and child
went to live in Paris. They took a small apartment out in Levallois
Perret.</p>

<p>It took Honorine some time to accustom herself to the new
conditions. Paris was strange and bewildering. They knew no one
there, and the people were hard to deal with and unresponsive.
Yvonne announced her intention of having no more lessons except
dancing and singing, and so she attended a conservatoire in the Rue
Farzillan. It was known at that time&mdash;for some reason or
other&mdash;as the "Conservatoire Voltaire," and it was run by an
old gentleman named Sigogne, who had been a ballet master and
producer at several Parisian theatres.</p>

<p>At first Honorine was hardly conscious of the significance of
this determination of her daughter to devote herself to singing and
dancing. She was absorbed with the details of reconstructing their
new home, and only too happy that Yvonne was having what she
desired. As for Yvonne, she was deliriously happy. She found
herself suddenly plunged into a world which she had believed to be
unattainable. She was in Paris, the Mecca of her dreams. She met
girls who were going on the stage. She proved to her teachers that
she was a pupil of more than average promise.</p>

<p>At the end of six months Honorine received a visit from Monsieur
Sigogne. He was a tiny little bald-headed man, who looked like a
linnet. He hopped into the room and chirruped:</p>

<p>"Madame Marcillac, I congratulate you. Your daughter has great
talent. She shall stay with me for two years, and then she will go
far."</p>

<p>And patting her hands, he smiled, bowed, and took his departure
without another word. Even then Honorine did not entirely grasp the
significance of this new departure. It was brought home to her
slowly, in the fulness of time. It came about through their
friends. Honorine had few friends, but this deficit was more than
atoned for by her daughter. Yvonne rapidly formed a great circle of
passionate attachments. They were mostly fellow pupils or their
friends. They came flooding into the little apartment, and their
talk was all about stars, and salaries, and parts, and jealousies,
and scandals. They were amusing people, vain and naive,
self-centred, warm-hearted and impetuous. But Honorine was a little
frightened of them. Moreover they added considerably to the upkeep
of the establishment. They led Yvonne into extravagances which she
could not afford.</p>

<p>At the end of the first year she found they were living above
their means. She did not complain. She struggled on, denying
herself many little personal comforts. Then she heard these friends
talking among themselves. They were discussing the question of when
Yvonne would be ready, who she should go to, what line she should
take up, whether she should concentrate on singing or dancing.</p>

<p>One day when they were alone Madame Marcillac said to her
daughter:</p>

<p>"My darling, is it your intention to go on the stage?"</p>

<p>"But of course, my dear,"</p>

<p>Honorine looked down at her long fingers, lined and drawn with
years of toil. She heard her daughter add a little abruptly:</p>

<p>"I suppose you have no objection, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, little one...you must do as you desire," she said
quietly.</p>

<p>When rather less than nineteen, Yvonne went on the stage. She
obtained a small part in a musical comedy at Rouen. Honorine stayed
there with her. The piece ran for three months, but it gave Yvonne
little chance to distinguish herself. At the end of the run they
returned to Paris, and for a long time she got nothing else to do
at all. This early disappointment upset her badly. She became
querulous and bitter. It was Honorine who encouraged her, and
painted optimistic pictures of her future. It was nearly a year
before she got a small part in a musical piece that was to have an
extended tour. The salary was very small and after considerable
discussion it was decided that Honorine should not go with her. The
expense would be too great, and Yvonne seemed anxious to be left to
her own devices.</p>

<p>Honorine spent a lonely time in her little apartment. She wrote
to Yvonne every day. She sent her presents and all the money she
could spare, for Yvonne's salary was not large enough to live on in
the way she had recently become accustomed to. Yvonne replied
spasmodically. The longer she was away the less frequent became her
letters and when they came they were usually concerned with her
petty triumphs and conquests, and plaints concerning the expense of
living on tour.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac decided that she must work. What could she do?
She had no skill or ability at anything except housework and
sewing. And she knew that Yvonne would be ashamed of her mother
occupying herself in this menial way. Nevertheless, she could not
remain idle, and something must be done to counteract her
daughter's extravagance. So she went out secretly and got work at a
<i>pension</i> near by. She worked nine hours daily, and at night
came home and wrote a cheery letter to her daughter, giving the
impression that she was leading a life of comfort and idleness.</p>

<p>When the tour finished Yvonne returned to Paris, and Honorine
deserted her <i>pension</i>, with a guilty feeling that she had
done wrong. It would be superfluous to chronicle the record of the
next three years of Yvonne's career. It was an ordinary story of
little successes and big disappointments. She ran into debt and
moved in strange company, whilst Honorine stood watchfully and
protectingly on the fringe of these experiences. But at the end of
the third year, she made a sudden leap to fame.</p>

<p class="cpb">VIII</p>

<p>A Jewish gentleman named Karl Matz saw her dance in a
<i>revue</i> at a cabaret in the Boulevard St. Martin. After the
performance he went round to see her. Without removing a cigar from
the corner of his mouth, he said:</p>

<p>"You are being badly managed. You can dance. I could do
something with you. Would you care for a contract?"</p>

<p>Care! Yvonne was beside herself with excitement, bhe signed the
contract with Monsieur Matz next day binding herself to him for
five years at a fixed salary' whether working or not.</p>

<p>It proved a highly satisfactory contract&mdash;for Monsieur
Matz.</p>

<p>He sent her to a dancing master, Poldini, to whom he gave very
precise instructions. He also told her that she must change her
name. Yvonne Marcillac sounded too sombre for a dancer. After a
good deal of discussion, it was decided that she was to be called
"Carmen Colignon." Three months later she appeared at the Folies
Bergeres in a ballet called <i>A Travers les Ages</i>. She was a
cave woman with bare legs and a panther skin in the opening act,
and in the last act a society woman in a snake skin. She made an
instantaneous hit.</p>

<p>Honorine watched the performance from the back of the
auditorium, and when she heard the roar of applause after Yvonne's
first dance tears trickled down her cheeks.</p>

<p>When the show was over she hurried behind to take her child
away. She found Yvonne surrounded by admirers. Her eyes were
dancing still. She was almost too excited to acknowledge her
mother, but when the latter whispered:</p>

<p>"Come, my little one, you must come home to supper; you will be
tired." The daughter replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, I shan't be coming home to supper tonight. I've
promised to go out with Monsieur Matz and Mademoiselle Folvary and
some of the others."</p>

<p>That was the beginning of Honorine's tragic phase, doubly tragic
by reason of her own foresight of what was going to happen. One may
give to another one's life's blood, one's love, and passion, and
devotion, but one cannot make that other love one as one may desire
to be loved. Yvonne did not really love her mother. She was fond of
her, and she relied upon her, and respected her, but her real love
was the glamour of success. In the years that followed it
intoxicated her. She became the rage of Paris, and Monsieur Matz
became a rich man.</p>

<p>The more successful she became the more indifferent she became
towards her mother, and the more devoted her mother became to her.
She watched over her, and tended her, and prayed for her. When
Yvonne was not dancing she was always lunching or dining with her
friends, or driving in the Bois. It is to be feared that she was a
little ashamed of her mother in the presence of her brilliant
friends. Honorine was now nearly fifty. Her life of toil had left
its mark on her. She was a little what is known as "provincial."
She wore the same kind of old-fashioned frocks that she used to
wear at the farm at Cambo. Her hands were hard and bony, like a
servant's. Her remarks were trite and commonplace. She was out of
place in that astounding environment. Yvonne seldom introduced her.
She would go down to the theatre and hang about the corridors,
waiting to see if her daughter wanted anything. And people would
say:</p>

<p>"Who is that old countrywoman?"</p>

<p>And the answer would be:</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you know? That's the mother of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>But even then she was not altogether unhappy. Sometimes she
would take herself to task and think: "Why am I not unhappy? I give
my whole life to my daughter, and she does not respond."</p>

<p>And she would look down into the darkening streets, and see the
crowds rushing hither and thither on dubious errands. Lamps being
lighted, and somewhere in the distance a bell would be
tolling...And she would think:</p>

<p>"Even if she does not love me I can still serve her. I am her
mother."</p>

<p>And dreams would come to her.</p>

<p class="cpb">IX</p>

<p>Within a very short time her mind was diverted by material
considerations. At first the two hundred francs a month which
Monsieur Matz had agreed to pay Yvonne appeared a princely sum. But
when she became a star it seemed to dwindle into nothingness. A
star must have attendant satellites and luxuries. Yvonne was far
too dazzled by her facile success to worry over such details as
settling bills or considering ways and means. The more she earned
the more she spent. At the end of the first year Madame Marcillac
found herself faced with debts she could see no way to meet except
by drawing on her capital. She put the matter to Yvonne, who
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, that doesn't matter, mother. I shall soon be earning more,
and when my contract runs out they'll have to pay me thousands a
night."</p>

<p>When her contract ran out! But that was four years hence. At the
present pace Madame Marcillac's capital would be exhausted before
then. She pleaded with her daughter to be economical, to think of
the future. Yvonne did make some sort of attempt to curb her
extravagances&mdash;until the next temptation came along. Between
the mother and daughter there began to yawn unbridgable chasms of
reserve. Yvonne did not mean to be denied the attainment of these
new delights. She became furtive and mendacious.. She borrowed
money on the quiet, and made all kinds of excuses for breaking into
Madame Marcillac's dwindling capital.</p>

<p>So far she had had many admirers but no one who could truthfully
be called a lover. But a year after her leap to fame there appeared
upon the scene a young actor named Max Gion. He was not a
particularly good actor, neither was he very successful, and he had
no money. They became engaged.</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac thrilled with delight at her daughter's
engagement. The man was young and good-looking, and he had charming
manners. It was a love match. She had always dreaded that Yvonne
might marry some elderly man for his money.</p>

<p>Soon, however, she found that what the young couple had most in
common was a passion for extravagance. When not performing they
spent most of their time in cabs and restaurants. Rather than being
relieved, her financial commitments were doubled. The capital began
to dwindle. Yvonne was dancing superbly, and "Carmen Colignon" was
a star of the first magnitude. Her portraits were everywhere. She
was painted and sculpted by famous artists. The journals rang with
her praises. But Monsieur Matz was not inclined to deviate one
franc from the terms of his contract. He had discovered her and
made her. He had run the risk of her being a failure.</p>

<p>At the end of the second year of their acquaintance the young
couple married and took a little flat in the rue de la Baume. It
was plainly hinted that Max would rather not have his beloved
Yvonne's mother to live with them. And so she took one room in a
little street just off the avenue des Ternes. She lived alone, but
her identity was soon established. When she walked quietly
backwards and forwards people nudged each other and said:</p>

<p>"Do you know who that is? That's the mother of Carmen
Colignon."</p>

<p>And they argued amongst themselves as to why so beautiful and
famous a star should have such a queer old fish for a mother. And
some wondered why the daughter did not see that her mother was kept
in happier circumstances. And they shrugged their shoulders. These
theatrical people!...</p>

<p>As the years passed Honorine lived more within herself. Her love
for her daughter became a vital abstraction. She gave her all that
Yvonne might lead the life she desired. But they had nothing in
common. Honorine hovered like a moth on the outskirts of this
dazzling and dangerous effulgence wherein her daughter pirouetted
to the clamorous approbation of the mob.</p>

<p class="cpb">X</p>

<p>One day her daughter came to her in great distress. Max&mdash;of
the good looks and charming manners&mdash;was not all that he
appeared. He had put his name on the back of a bill. Within seven
days he had to find fifteen thousand francs. The alternative was a
law case, bankruptcy&mdash;possibly arrest.</p>

<p>The fifteen thousand francs was withdrawn from Madame
Marcillac's capital. The gay life continued. Before Yvonne's
contract had run out her mother was ruined. She had not a penny in
the world except what she earned. She went out secretly and
reverted to her old profession of housework and sewing. Yvonne
seldom asked her mother how she passed her time.</p>

<p>In the meantime Yvonne's life had not been without emotional
incident. As their debts increased and they saw no possibility of
relief from the mother, they quarrelled bitterly. There were
scenes, recrimination, almost ending in a <i>crime passionelle</i>.
Eventually Yvonne had no difficulty in divorcing her depraved young
husband, and immediately afterwards she married a rich elderly
merchant named Mocquard. Paris was intrigued. Her reputation became
more assured. When her contract expired she was re-engaged at an
enormous figure. She was rich beyond her wildest dreams.</p>

<p>It was at that point that the cleavage with her mother became
pronounced. Madame Marcillac would not take a penny of her
daughter's money. She gave no reason. It was not for her to
criticise. She went calmly about her affairs, her eyes filled with
wonder and awe. She went frequently to see her daughter, at an hour
when she knew no one would be about. On only one occasion did she
show signs of distress. That was on the occasion of her first visit
to the new house in the avenue Malakoff, when Yvonne, all aglow
with her new wealth and success, openly boasted about it, and
offered to make her mother a handsome allowance. And the tears had
started to Honorine's eyes, and pressing her hand to her heart, she
had exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, my dear...my little one..."</p>

<p>But she could say no more, and she went quietly away, after
refusing the offer. She was set down then definitely as a crank.
She was pointed at in the street and laughed at.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such an old sketch? That's the mother of
Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>Her figure became familiar on the boulevards, and once Sem did a
caricature of her which appeared in <i>Le Rire</i>, and which made
Yvonne very angry. Honorine shifted her quarters, and took a room
up in Montmartre in the rue Cortot.</p>

<p>Years passed. Her eyesight was not too good, and she had trouble
with her feet, and one day she bought a stout hickory stick for
support. She found work a little tiring, but people were kind to
her. She made many friends among people of her own class, who were
always anxious and willing to help her.</p>

<p>One December day as she was walking through the square of St.
Pierre there came to her a sudden flow of memories of her youth, of
her husband, and the days on the old farm at Cambo. Cambo! Hard
upon these memories came the reflection that the farm at Cambo
belonged to her daughter. It was to be hers when she became of age.
Strange that she should have forgotten this all these years. If
Yvonne did not object she would not mind accepting the gift. It was
associated with a period of calm happiness and purity. It was
earned by her own husband by honest toil. She flushed a little at
the temptation. Perhaps she would go back there to end her
days...</p>

<p>Yvonne had no objection. She laughed contemptuously at what she
called "the old piggery." Most certainly her mother should have it.
She herself was far too engrossed in big things to worry about such
a trifle.</p>

<p>And so one day she packed an old black bag and returned to
Biarritz. She was away five days. She went to see Monsieur
Pironneau. He was very evasive. He used terms she could not
understand. Yes, Monsieur and Madame Ombredanne were still living
there. They had a large family. He talked about entail, and
forfeiture, and surrenders. She could not tell whether the farm was
to be her property or not. The next day she went out to Cambo and
wandered around it. She had not the heart to call. It all looked
very much the same. She went back to Biarritz and again interviewed
the lawyer. It is impossible to know how long she would have been
kept there in this indeterminate condition, but her visit was cut
short. On the fifth day she picked up a newspaper in the little
<i>pension</i> where she was staying, and a headline caught her
eye. "Serious illness of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>She caught the night train back to Paris, and drove to her
daughter's house in the avenue Malakoff. A servant admitted her.
The house was all in a fluster. Yes, Carmen Colignon was very ill.
The doctor believed it was smallpox, caught at the theatre from one
of the stage hands. Monsieur Mocquard was staying elsewhere. He had
been advised to, as the disease was very catching. She forced her
way upstairs. A dark-featured nurse met her on the landing, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>"You cannot go upstairs. The upper floor is isolated. Madame
Mocquard is seriously ill."</p>

<p>"I am going up."</p>

<p>"Who are you?"</p>

<p>"I am her mother."</p>

<p>She pushed back a curtain reeking with disinfectant, and went up
to her daughter's bedroom. Yvonne was semi-conscious. For six days
and nights she never went further from her daughter's bedside than
the adjoining room. She ate hardly anything and slept less. The two
nurses, after the first irruption of her entry, took kindly to her.
She was useful, and after all she was the patient's mother. She had
penetrated into the sick chamber, and if she was to catch the
disease she would catch it, whether she stayed or went. On the
sixth night she fainted from sheer exhaustion. One of the nurses
gave her a powerful sleeping draught. She slept for eleven hours.
She came to in a dreamy semi-comatose condition. She thought she
was back at the farm at Cambo. Little Yvonne was packing her sachel
preparatory for school. She was sing-ing in her childish tremulo a
song called "<i>Les fleurs qui passent.</i>"</p>

<p>The nurse entered and stood by her bedside. After a short pause
she said: "Madame Marcillac, I'm sorry to say your daughter passed
away in the night."</p>

<p>Madame Marcillac turned on her side, but she did not speak. She
wanted to hear little Yvonne finish the song, "<i>Les fleurs qui
passent</i>."</p>

<p>After a time she wept a little and rose from her bed. She put on
her cloak and went into her daughter's bedroom. When she beheld her
she made the sign of the cross, and knelt by the bedside. And there
she remained in prayer for a long while...</p>

<p class="cpb">XI</p>

<p>All Paris flocked to the funeral of Carmen Colignon. Senators,
merchant princes, artists, students, and actors drove out to Pere
La Chaise. There were carriages by the score, and magnificent
wreaths from Monsieur Mocquard, Monsieur Matz, and other fights of
the theatrical profession. The newspapers outvied each other in
eulogistic competition. It was an event.</p>

<p>Honorine walked to the funeral.</p>

<p>In the distinguished company hardly anyone noticed the old
countrywoman who hobbled into the cemetery, leaning on a hickory
stick. She stood on the outskirts of the crowd, and when the
ceremony was over she wandered away alone in the direction of the
Seine. Alone!...She had no definite plans formed in her mind. She
was stunned by the abruptness of the catastrophe, broken by the
completeness of it. She found herself wandering by the north bank
of the river, looking across at the pile of buildings on the He de
la Cite, dominated by Notre Dame. The water looked grey and
inviting...sleep-giving. Oh, how she needed sleep! It was Christmas
time. People were hurrying hither and thither with parcels and
flowers. No, it was not true that all Paris was at the funeral of
Carmen Colignon. "All Paris" is a phrase. Many had hardly heard of
her. Most were indifferent. Even those who wept and sent expensive
wreaths, how long would it be before they, too, forgot?...</p>

<p>Only love is permanent; only a mother's love perhaps...She
looked up at the cupola of <i>Notre Dame</i>, and her eye alighted
on the cross. <i>Notre Dame</i>! Oh, Mother of God! She seemed to
sense in that instant the whole significance of her own fife, and
yet she remained dumb...inarticulate. She could express nothing.
She had given something which finked her to a spirit greater than
her own. She looked up humbly, her eyes filled with wonder and
reverence. Barges glided by, and the people hurrying in their
thousands, people who had hardly heard of Carmen Colignon. She was
conscious of her heart filled with pity and compassion...of a great
immensity, of something vast wherein nestle the loves, passions,
fears, and frailties of every living thing. And turning her back on
the river, she walked slowly away...</p>

<p class="cpb">XII</p>

<p>Tap-tap! Tap-tap! Along the Rue Cadec she comes this Sunday
morning, smiling to herself as though with childish memories. And
the men touch their hats and the women cry: "Good-morning, maman.
May God preserve you!"</p>

<p>She hobbles on, her old bony fingers clutching the handle of the
string bag. She passes by, leaving a trail of unexplained
delight.</p>

<p>Tap-tap! Tap-tap!</p>

<p>"Who is she?"</p>

<p>"Don't you know? That's the mother of Carmen Colignon."</p>

<p>"And who in God's name is Carmen Colignon?"</p>

<p>Just by old Grognon's shop she pauses, and her face is
silhouetted against the dark opening. It is lined and scored by a
hundred tiny cracks and wrinkles, but the beauty remains. And one
regards it as, after many years, a reader might regard a leaf that
had been pressed between the leaves of some old volume and long
forgotten; and the reader gazes enchanted, held by the vision of
this magic network of myriad perfections.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. DARK RED ROSES</h2>

<p>Twixt sleeping and waking there came to him a moment of quiet
exaltation. His consciousness was revelling in the surf of some far
distant and yet familiar sea where the sirens whispered:</p>

<p>"You are well. You are happy. You are virile. You have achieved
great things, and you will achieve more. You are enveloped in love
and beauty and youth."</p>

<p>The sun was creeping between the cracks of the dark blind.
Spring! In a short while he would be out in it all. He would grasp
it in his hand&mdash;love, and beauty and youth. He lay there
vividly intent upon himself, his environment, his happiness.</p>

<p>Below the window the dew would be sparkling upon daffodils and
jonquils, primula and violets. A starling up in the apple tree was
chanting a eulogy of spring. In the next room&mdash;the white door
slightly ajar&mdash;his wife was sleeping. He could almost see her,
curled up in that way she had, like a little round ball, her
glorious fair hair scattered over the pillow, her dark lashes, her
beautiful fair skin, her small mouth firmly shut, just the tilt of
that little wilful chin&mdash;how he loved her!</p>

<p>In two rooms at the end of the corridor, Mervyn, aged nine, and
Diana, aged eleven, were sleeping as only youth can
sleep...Children of this cloudless love match. The fullness and the
richness of their day was before them, and he possessed it as much
as they.</p>

<p>Half dozing, half dreaming, he lay there an infinity of time
absorbed in this sense of happiness...he was creating. He saw form,
and the beauty of form, and the building of form. He was a
sculptor...</p>

<p>And then his mind abruptly registered the probable reason of his
exultant mood&mdash;the letter which had arrived by the last post
the previous night, announcing that his model had been accepted by
an important Corporation in the North. He had received this
sought-after commission above all his fellows. The work would take
him a year to accomplish, but what a year! His consciousness
cleared. He began to work on the details of his undertaking.
Technical problems were being faced, the frenzy of creation, with
its pains, penalties and ecstasies. He would give to the world all
that was best in him. Dear life! to be happily married, to have
children, to be healthy and virile, and at the age of forty-seven
to be recognized as one of the foremost sculptors in the world, was
it not enough on this Spring morning to work him into a state of
fevered anticipation and delight?</p>

<p>"I musn't think too much of myself, about myself. I don't want
it all for myself, it's for the others&mdash;the people I love,
even the people I don't love. It's all too big, too overpowering to
take to oneself. Oh, the glory and the beauty of the world."</p>

<p>He restrained the temptation to get up and rush into the garden
until he heard the familiar sound of domestic movements. Then he
arose and went into the bathroom. The thrill of cold water down his
spine urged him to song, deep-chested and passionate, even if a
little out of tune. He rubbed himself down, his eyes glimpsing, not
without pride, the fine proportions of his legs and torso. He
completed his toilet with care and discretion, and then visited his
wife. She was already drinking tea and reading an illustrated
paper. He kissed her and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Well, my darling, sleep well?"</p>

<p>"I always do. You've been making an awful noise in the
bath-room."</p>

<p>He laughed tempestuously, teased her a little, discussed the
petty arrangements of their daily routine, and then went downstairs
to the breakfast-room. He always regretted that Laura insisted on
having her breakfast in bed. Breakfast was the most glorious meal
in the day. The sun poured into the breakfast-room. The garden was
ablaze with green and white and yellow and red. "Rags," the old
sheep dog, bounded to him, buried its nozzle between its master's
knees, and peered at him, its sentimental eyes gleaming amidst the
profusion of shaggy fur.</p>

<p>"Rags, Rags, dear old Rags, what is the day going to bring forth
for us? I'm hungry, Rags, what about you?"</p>

<p>But Rags never seemed to be hungry. He seemed quite content to
sit at the feet of his master and to feed on the glorious vision. A
maid appeared with glittering silver dishes and a coffee urn. A
gong sounded. He moved to the sidetable and picked up his letters
and his newspapers. His interest quickened. The letters,
mysteriously intriguing in their uncut state, linking him to
friends, and the glamour of his career; the newspapers equally so
with the whole cosmic creation. What had the world to tell him
to-day? He stood there happily bemused, turning the letters over.
And then suddenly what a to-do! The children and their governess.
He was enveloped in a swirl of pulsating vital forces. Youth
consumed with the prescience of a terrific day's programme. A
terrific business having breakfast, making arrangements,
anticipating, discussing. He was almost overlooked in the important
trifles. Just pleased to have him there, happy at seeing father
well and happy, but no time for endearments, no time for questions
or solicitude. The rabbits had to be fed. George, the gardener, was
reputed to have promised to bring along two guinea pigs. A cousin
was coming to tea. Mervyn's cricket bat had got to be sent to the
makers to be re-bound. Diana had to be reproved by the governess
for calling Mrs. Weak, the housekeeper, a "silly sausage." There
was a picture postcard of Zermatt from Uncle Walter. All
terrifically important...breathless. In the midst of it all he
laughed loudly in sheer happiness. And the children laughed too,
for no reason&mdash;just contagion, and Rags joined in the din.</p>

<p>Breakfast over at last, and he lighted his pipe and went out
into the sun. He sat on the bench below the tennis lawn, and looked
at the spring flowers, entranced. At the end of the garden the
black wooden studio partly concealed by foliage was calling him. He
enjoyed the tumult of restraint. There was no hurry. Was he not
fully conscious of his powers? Was he not even now, working,
creating? A wood-pigeon was cooing in the coppice beyond the
vegetable garden. His senses tingled with the thrill of the sweet,
pure air, the perfume of wallflowers, the familiar comfort of good
tobacco. His mind was working rapidly. Thus and thus would he do to
improve upon that model. A curious sense of detachment crept over
him, as though he were looking down on himself. Almost impatiently
he arose, and wandered through the grounds, his grounds
and&mdash;hers. He was consumed with a kind of contemplative lust
of possession. He found himself in the white panelled drawing-room.
There, indeed, could he give his sense of possession full play. Was
there ever such a beautiful room? A genuine Queen Anne room with
French windows leading on to the lawn. There was the jolly walnut
tall-boy which they had bought on their honeymoon, from a dealer in
Falmouth. He could almost see Laura now, leaning on his arm. He
could hear the tone of her adorable voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, darling, wouldn't it be lovely to have it?"</p>

<p>It meant a lot in those days. They were very poor when they
married. But somehow he managed to buy the tall-boy because Laura
wanted it so much. And there it stood to this day. And it had
collected around it a company of worthy fellows, a William and Mary
cabinet which he bought at a sale in Seven Oaks, a set of original
seventeenth century walnut chairs which he got at Christie's at an
appalling price...Things were different now. On the further wall
was his choicest possession&mdash;an interior by Pieter de Hoogh in
an ebony and tortoiseshell frame. He sank back in an easy chair and
regarded it lovingly. Everything in the room was beautiful from the
Pieter de Hoogh to the daffodils in a cut glass vase on the bureau.
Everything was symbolical of the unity of his married state. His
taste and hers&mdash;what joy it had been to struggle, to select,
to build. He thought of the old days when he had been a poor boy
apprenticed to a builder at Nottingham, showing little aptitude or
ambition. It was not till he was nearly thirty that he suddenly
developed the passion to express in form the strange surgings of
his soul. He had saved up money and been to Italy and studied
Donatello...Thirty-five he was when he first met Laura. She seemed
a slip of a girl, almost boyish. For a long while he had pondered
over the problem of their mutual infatuation. He was twelve years
older than she. Would it be right? Could he make her happy? "When I
am so-and-so, she will be so-and-so," he envisaged every phase of
married state.</p>

<p>Well, well, he had nothing to regret. When they marry a man may
be a little older than a woman. Especially if he keep himself fit,
and y sane, and temperate. A man has all the advantages. He was
hardly conscious of the passing years, except as they added to his
spiritual stature. He had mastered his art. He had wrested from the
social conflict honour, and fame, and wealth. His love had
developed into a finer, richer passion than it had been when he
first met her. She was linked to him indissolubly by the ties of
children, and the associations of passion and tenderness. O God!
how happy, how happy!...And they had built this beautiful nest in
the Surrey hills. Step by step, piece by piece, their tastes ever
in common, every little thing in the house was a symbol of their
mutual understanding. And they were surrounded by friends.</p>

<p>There was old Morrison, the painter, who lived at "The Seven
Gables," across the valley, a wealthy and entertaining old man who
frequently came to dine. There were the Stapleys, and the
Brontings, and Guy Lewisham, and there was that young violinist,
Anton Falk, who had come to live with the Brontings, an engaging
and romantic figure. Several evenings a week he would come, and
play glorious passages from Bach and Paganini in this very room.
And Laura would accompany him. He loved to lie back on the window
seat and watch her bending over the keys, the pink glow from the
lamp suffusing the beautiful room, the tense, pale face of the
young fiddler frowning over his instrument. In music one finds the
solution of all one's spiritual unrest.</p>

<p>He rose again impatiently, moved by an impulse to touch his
possessions. He moved from piece to piece, smoking his pipe, and
passing his hand affectionately over glossy surfaces. He buried his
nose in flowers. There were flowers everywhere, flowers that
<i>she</i> had gathered and arranged&mdash;spring flowers. Then
once more he sat back in an easy chair and sighed contentedly.</p>

<p>The door opened abruptly, and the room appeared to receive the
final note of its ultimate expression. Laura glided in, wearing a
frock of thick white lace, and in her hand she carried a bunch of
dark red roses, wrapped in that thin paper that florists use. She
started slightly at sight of him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Hullo, dear, you're not working then&mdash;"</p>

<p>He laughed gaily at her momentary confusion, and at the
exquisite vision of her supple movements.</p>

<p>"How clever of you," he said, "to come in at that moment. I was
looking at the room. It just wanted that note&mdash;the girl in a
white frock holding a bunch of dark red roses."</p>

<p>"Aren't they lovely!" she exclaimed and bent over them. She
removed the paper, scrumpled it up into a ball and threw it into
the paper basket. Then she produced a a glass bowl and a pair of
scissors. With loving care she arranged the roses, humming to
herself as she cut their stalks, and set them in the bowl on the
centre table. His eyes caressed her every movement. When she had
completed her task she went across to him and sat on the arm of his
chair.</p>

<p>"Don't they look lovely!" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "They are exquisite&mdash;almost exotic. It is
early in the year for roses."</p>

<p>She sighed as though a little impatient of his plaint.</p>

<p>"They must come from abroad," he ruminated. "Or perhaps bred
under glass. We do not get such roses here till June."</p>

<p>"They come from Stoole's, the florists," she explained,
fluttering towards the window like a little bird restless for
flight.</p>

<p>"Davy," she suddenly added, "is it quite easy to take a cast of
anyone's hands?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite easy."</p>

<p>"I thought it would be rather jolly to have a cast of Anton's
hands. Have you ever noticed what beautiful hands he has?"</p>

<p>"Yes, they are beautiful hands."</p>

<p>"There's something romantic about the hands of a musician,
something one would like to preserve. He is coming this evening. Do
you think you could spare time?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. It would take less than an hour of my valuable
time. You shall have a cast of your fiddler's hands, my dear."</p>

<p>"Thanks so much, Davy."</p>

<p>The little bird fluttered through the French window and down
into the garden. But the man continued to sit there, intent on his
happiness and the serene beauty of the room. The dark red roses
produced in the artist in him a queer emotion. They were
extraordinarily beautiful, and yet they left upon him a slight
impression of disquiet. The room was no longer so serene or
tranquil. They were a note of luxury and defiance. In the fullness
of their blooming two petals had already dropped, and lay upon the
dark table like little pools of blood. It was the season for
daffodils and primroses, the virgin flowers which herald in the
spring, but these spoke of warm summer nights or southern
climes.</p>

<p>"It is early in the year for roses."</p>

<p>Very slowly he rose, and walked towards them. The richness of
their perfume assailed his nostrils. Much as he loved them they
jarred his sensibilities, like a perversion or a wanton feast. He
turned away, and went as though driven by some subconscious force
to the waste-paper basket. With quiet deliberation he unfolded the
paper they had been wrapped in. A piece of card had apparently
escaped his wife's detection. He picked it up and read it. On it
was scribbled in pencil, "To my darling." There was no signature.
Guiltily he tore it up, and returned it and the paper to the
basket.</p>

<p>And that morning he worked with the fury of creation. With long
strides he reached his studio. His hands clutched and fashioned
great masses of clay. Forms emerged from chaos, forms expressing
beauty and humility. So engrossed was he with his new concepts that
he did not return to the house for lunch. He sent his assistant
over for a tray of food, which he devoured savagely, standing by
his model all the while, like a mother fearful of some treacherous
attack upon her child.</p>

<p>Sometimes the laughter of the children, playing in the garden,
reached him, and once he heard his wife singing...The long day drew
on. At six o'clock his assistant left. A little later there was a
tap at the door, and it opened before he had time to say, "Come
in."</p>

<p>Laura came gaily in, followed by the young man. "Here's Anton,
dear. Are you very, very busy?"</p>

<p>Her eyes were sparkling with the love of life. The young man was
grave and deferential.</p>

<p>"Very, very busy. How are you, Anton?"</p>

<p>"What about those hands, David?"</p>

<p>"Ah, yes, I had forgotten. Those hands&mdash;let me see them,
Anton."</p>

<p>The young man held out his long delicate fingers.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are indeed beautiful hands, beautifully proportioned.
The fingers long and tapering, the tips slightly flattened.
Beautiful hands. I will take a cast of them. But you must excuse me
for the moment. I have something to finish. Anton will stay to
dinner. Afterwards we will have a little music perhaps? And then I
will take a cast of Anton's hands."</p>

<p>"You mustn't work too hard, Davey. You haven't left the studio
since ten o'clock this morning. You'll be knocking yourself
up."</p>

<p>"Thank you for your solicitude. I'm feeling remarkably robust.
Now run away and play, children."</p>

<p>Any feeling of constraint which might have marred the dinner
party that evening was dissipated by the arrival of Laura's mother,
a dear old lady who was extremely garrulous and amusing. As a
matter of fact the dinner was unusually merry. Laura was in the
highest spirits, and David talkative and reminiscent. Only the
young man seemed self-conscious and reserved, plainly anxious for
the meal to end. But if his tongue was silent, he was sufficiently
eloquent with his eyes.</p>

<p>The music that followed was not a success. Anton was obviously
not in the mood, and Laura was apt to be frivolous. The old mother
acknowledged frankly that classical music bored her.</p>

<p>David was restless and eager to consummate his preconceived
purposes.</p>

<p>During a pause he arose abruptly and said:</p>

<p>"Come. I'm afraid we must terminate this concert if I am to take
a cast of Anton's hands to-night."</p>

<p>"Why, yes," exclaimed Laura. "I was forgetting all about it.
Shall we all go over to the studio?"</p>

<p>"No." David was emphatic. "You stay here with your mother. Anton
and I will go over there alone."</p>

<p>He almost relished the tinge of disappointment which flickered
at the back of his wife's eyes. Out in the hall he said:</p>

<p>"Put on your hat and coat, Anton. These April evenings are
treacherous."</p>

<p>They walked the length of the dark garden and entered the
studio. David switched on the light.</p>

<p>"I shall not detain you long," he said. "The process is quite
simple. Here is a bowl of sweet oil. Will you please dip your hands
in it, and get them thoroughly saturated."</p>

<p>Anton did as he was bidden whilst the elder man prepared a
mixture of plaster of Paris and water.</p>

<p>"Does it take long to set?" asked the violinist, advancing to
the bench where David was at work. He was holding out his oily
hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, two or three minutes at the outside. But it is very
necessary to keep the hands quite still. Now, lay them face
downwards on this plaster bed. So."</p>

<p>He covered up the young man's hands with the cold wet plaster.
Then he continued:</p>

<p>"I have been handling piaster all my life. It is treacherous
stuff, shifting, unstable, unreliable&mdash;not unlike human
nature. In a case like this we usually use irons to keep it from
shifting. Allow me."</p>

<p>He passed the iron bands over the pool of plaster and bolted it
down into the bench.</p>

<p>"Does it feel cold?"</p>

<p>"It's not too bad, Mr. Cardew. Will you explain the process to
me?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure. We leave your hands there for a few moments till
the plaster sets. Then we remove the irons, and you will be able to
withdraw your hands quite easily. There remains then what we call a
mould. This I fill with more plaster mixed with soap and oil. I
leave this to set. I then chip away the outer mould and we arrive
at the completed cast. Quite simple and painless, you see. Laura
was most anxious to have a cast of your beautiful hands."</p>

<p>He laughed a little recklessly as he uttered the last sentence
in a cold incisive voice, and then he lighted his pipe. The seconds
ticked by, and neither man spoke. At the end of two minutes Anton
said:</p>

<p>"I think the plaster has set, Mr. Cardew. It feels like it."</p>

<p>David Cardew was perched on a high stool. He looked thoughtfully
into the bowl of his pipe. In passionless accents he suddenly
remarked:</p>

<p>"Dark red roses do not grow in April."</p>

<p>The young man looked up at him quickly:</p>

<p>"Dark red roses?"</p>

<p>"Nature makes laws, and men make codes. It's all very much the
same&mdash;the struggle for survival. Nature is cruel and
relentless, man less so. He does not want to set up these codes. He
is forced to do so. It is a blind subconscious force not so much
for the protection of the individual as for the preservation of the
type. We have our English saying, 'It isn't done.' It sounds inane
and foolish and conventional, but in effect it is quite a sound
dogma, founded on experience and tradition. It isn't done, Anton
Falk."</p>

<p>The young man gave him a quick glance and shifted his
position.</p>

<p>"Why do you say all this to me, Mr. Cardew?"</p>

<p>"Dark red roses in April&mdash;an exotic fancy! This is the time
of year when the hedgerows are alive with little innocent buds,
when the birds are mating, and youth and</p>

<p>purity are at the helm. The flowers of darker passions are out
of place. As a fellow artist you will appreciate this point of
view, I'm sure."</p>

<p>The young man gave a sudden scared look and made a violent
movement with his wrists.</p>

<p>"If you had the strength of ten men you could not draw your
hands from that mould, Mr. Falk."</p>

<p>The two men then looked full into each other's eyes, and both
understood. Anton's face was the colour of the plaster which
encased his hands.</p>

<p>"What are you saying, Mr. Cardew?" he said breathlessly. "What
are you implying? It's all false, I swear. My God! what are you
going to do?"</p>

<p>This latter query was caused by David Cardew's sudden action. He
had reached out and taken down from the wall a Japanese sword in a
carved ivory scabbard. Almost languidly he drew the sword and
remarked:</p>

<p>"An interesting old sword this. It was given me by an American
print collector, who brought it from Japan. It belonged to a famous
Samurai. Wonderful people the Samurai, with a code of honour and
morality that has never been surpassed. It is said that three
people have already died by this sword&mdash;the wife, the lover,
and then the man himself. Rather drastic you may say. In these days
we should think it sufficient to kill the lover."</p>

<p>The young man who was hanging limply by his hands suddenly
uttered a cry of terror.</p>

<p>"My God! your're mad, Mr. Cardew. Help! help!"</p>

<p>"They won't hear you in the house. The walls are thick, and the
wind is stirring in the trees."</p>

<p>"Don't talk like this. It's all false I tell you. I know what
you think, but it isn't true. I'm not your wife's lover."</p>

<p>The older man laughed cynically, and muttered:</p>

<p>"Dark red roses in the Spring."</p>

<p>"I'm fond of your wife, very fond, but there's nothing else, I
swear. I've never&mdash;Oh, for God's sake release my hands!"</p>

<p>"Very fond, very fond. Yes, yes, yes."</p>

<p>Suddenly the tones of his voice changed. He went up to his
captive and said savagely:</p>

<p>"I'm not going to kill you. It isn't done. Only listen to me,
killing is not the only thing that isn't done. Do you understand
me? I told you to bring your hat and coat because the April nights
are treacherous. The reason is that when I release you, you will
take the path through the vegetable garden and drop down into
Hood's Lane. You will go right away and never darken my doors
again. Do you understand that? Do you promise that? or would you
prefer to die?"</p>

<p>Hanging inert against the bench the young man whispered:</p>

<p>"Yes, I promise. But it's all false&mdash;it's all
false&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I want no lies, no protestations."</p>

<p>He sheathed the sword, and replaced it on the wall. He was
trembling all over when he unbolted the iron bands. Controlling his
passion he managed to say in a calm voice:</p>

<p>"Steady now, steady, Mr. Falk. Withdraw your hands carefully. I
must finish my work. Denise will be distressed if she does not have
the cast of the beautiful hands of the young violinist. There I
that's it, so. In the corner you will find a sink and some soap.
You may wash your hands. I'm afraid they're badly soiled. Then I
will see you into the lane."</p>

<p>The young man was completely unnerved. He withdrew his hands and
staggered towards the sink. He washed and wiped them on a towel,
but he was careful never to turn his back on his late captor. He
watched him furtively, prepared for flight. But David Cardew
appeared already pre-occupied. His eyes were solemnly regarding the
mould. There was nothing more to say on either side. When he had
put on his hat and coat, both men went silently out. David led the
way through the vegetable garden. At the end of it, he opened a
gate that led into the lane.</p>

<p>"You know your way, I think," was all he said, and the other
replied, "Yes." They parted without salutation, and Cardew returned
to the studio.</p>

<p>His emotions were in a state of riot. He could neither focus nor
decide upon his next actions. Youth, and beauty, and
love&mdash;shop-worn! Savagely he chipped away at the outer mould.
One sardonic desire pressed itself upon him.</p>

<p>"She shall have the beautiful white hands of her lover."</p>

<p>What was he going to do? How far was she involved? Could she
possibly love this man?</p>

<p>"He won't come back anyway. I've frightened the life out of him.
Spineless wretch!"</p>

<p>A few hours ago his happiness had been unbelievable. And
now&mdash;could it all be destroyed so easily? Could all the
associations of love, and passion, and tenderness be suddenly
uprooted? No, no, no, a thousand times no. She had loved him. Of
that there was not a shadow of doubt. This must be some mad spring
infatuation. It would pass. He would go to her. There would be a
little scene, and then she would weep on his breast, and he would
forgive her. And oh, he would be so gentle, and forgiving, and
loving, and she would fall asleep at last in his arms, like the
little child she was. A kind of fierce pride surged through him
when he thought how forgiving he would be. He completed the cast of
the fiddler's hands. There they were, the beautiful long, tapering
fingers with the slightly flat tips. He restrained the desire to
hurl them to the ground. He had promised them to Laura. It would be
a dramatic and potent way of starting their little scene. He would
say:</p>

<p>"Look! Here are the white hands of your lover. Sha ke them. They
have come to say Good-bye."</p>

<p>And Laura would give a little scream, and throw herself on the
bed. He hated the thought of hurting her, but the position had got
to be faced. The nettle had got to be gripped before its stalk
became too strong.</p>

<p>He wrapped the plaster hands in paper, shut up the studio, and
went stealthily towards the house. A light was burning in the
library. He hoped the mother had gone to bed. He would feign
exhaustion and suggest that they went up at once. The bedroom was
essentially the place for their little scene. He entered the hall
noiselessly. To his disappointment he heard the voice of his wife's
mother in the library. A sudden idea occurred to him. Perhaps Laura
had already confessed; perhaps she was confessing even now. He
tip-toed towards the door, which was ajar. He pushed it quietly
open another two inches, and stood there listening, holding the
plaster cast in his hand.</p>

<p>And this is what he heard&mdash;his wife's voice speaking
cheerily:</p>

<p>"Oh, mother darling, I forgot all about thanking you for those
lovely dark red roses you sent me from Stooles."</p>

<p>The mother's voice: "Oh, my dear, my dear, don't be absurd. As
though I should forget."</p>

<p>His wife's voice again: "Do you know, darling, isn't it a
scream! but Davey did forget. He was so taken up with his silly old
commission that he forgot all about my birthday! Isn't it too
funny! Mother darling, don't remind him. He would be so upset, the
poor dear!"</p>

<p>David Cardew fumbled his way through the door, but so agitated
was he that he dropped the plaster cast on the parquet floor and it
smashed to smithereens.</p>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. THE LITTLE WINDOW OF THE
NIGHT</h2>

<p>Well, well, what does it all matter? Pass the little silver
spoon. Stir. Stir very gently. For to-night is the night of the
carnival.</p>

<p>Quite soon Denise will be here. I shall hear her step upon the
stair, the click of the latch, and then her gay laugh, and the
mellow sound of that voice which means everything to me in heaven
above and the earth beneath.</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, darling, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Ready! O, God! how beautiful she is. She trembles in my arms.
She is all vivid youth, and all utterly mine. When she is not here
I do not exist, It is all a sluggard twilight; and suddenly she
comes, and the birds are singing in the trees and the kingcups are
glowing in a sunlit meadow. When I look into her eyes I am as young
as she, a strong man of virile purposes. The poignant moment is
all-sufficient. She is mine, and we are a twin-god praising the
beauty of the hour. I feel myself a person of tremendous power. All
that is best in me is newly discovered. I want to pour out all my
strength to serve her. I am breathless for the exchange of
understanding. Small things become charged with pregnant
significance. We create as we look into each other's eyes, and
touch each other's hands. We race along through golden corridors of
time. No other hour has ever been till this. And yet I have heard
men say she is not beautiful. Who am I to judge? It is just that
curve of those smooth cheeks that is Denise and no one else. Just
that little tilted nose, the dark-brown hair, the poise of that
dear chin and neck, the slender figure. It is all hers, and hers
and no other's. And therefore it is mine. And those eyes that await
on me, and are so eloquent, those eyes that never misunderstand me,
that anticipate my thoughts, that interpret my love. And as I watch
her move, and hear her speak, I do not ask whether she is
beautiful. She is Denise. She is the alpha and omega of life. There
could be nothing different. It would be unthinkable...</p>

<p>She sails across the room to me, holding out her arms. She is
wearing a frock of fantastic hues, and in her hair dark-red
poppies. Dark-red poppies!...Yes, yes, of course; to-night is the
night of the carnival!</p>

<p>So vivid are these moments that sometimes I dream she is here
before she actually arrives. I sit by my attic window, watching the
little particles of dust flicker in the pale shaft of sunlight.
Below me I hear the drone and cries of the great city. A woman over
the way is playing that Spanish thing of Debussy's&mdash;<i>Soirée
dans Grenade</i>. It always excites me. I see the sun sinking
behind the mountains. In the courtyard of a dim palace are groups
of people. Three swarthy, dark-featured men are playing the guitar
and the mandolin, their sensual faces grinning in the amber light.
A woman is dancing, quite unconscious of their animal glances. Her
body sways, expressing the subtle <i>rubato</i> in the music.
Figures are moving covertly in the recesses of a balcony. Fireflies
whip the shadows. It is a melody of joy and infinite sadness. The
melody of the life of each one of us...Strange that music should
have this power! And as I listen to it I recall my first meeting
with Denise, for <i>she</i>, too, is a dancer.</p>

<p>No one ever danced quite like Denise. When I first saw her she
was like grass blown by the wind, or blossom falling from an
appletree, or flecks of cloud scudding across the sky at the break
of dawn. She all purity and movement. It is odd how dancing may
express all the emotions, exhaust the gamut of all the senses,
excite, degrade, inspire, elevate. I had been riding since
forenoon. Business in connection with the transfer of one of my
father's estates in Picardy had necessitated it. My father was very
old, and I an only son. Tired and thirsty, I rode into the
courtyard of the inn at Couturet-en-bois. I gave my horse over to a
groom. From the back of the inn came the sound of music. Languidly
I went up to my room. I looked out of the window. I beheld a
pleasure-garden where peasants made merry in holiday season.
Beneath a tree two travelling musicians were playing a country
gigue. On the grass in the open Denise was dancing. And I stood
there and watched, and forgot all about my fatigue and my stiff
limbs. She was little more than a child then, supple, lithesome,
appealing. She had that peculiar genius of all good dancers in that
she appeared to be quite unconscious of her body, and yet to have a
complete control of it. A score or so peasants and travellers were
seated on the grass. In the intervals there was applause and the
buzz of talk. An old man took round a tambourine and collected
money. I waited till the dance was finished, and then I buried my
face in my hands. The figure of Denise had danced its way into my
life, never to be deleted. I rang the bell. To the woman who
answered it I said:</p>

<p>"Who is this girl I have observed dancing in the grounds
yonder?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that!" replied the chambermaid; "that is Denise Floquet.
She is the daughter of old Leon Floquet.&mdash;a worthless fellow,
Monsieur."</p>

<p>"How worthless?"</p>

<p>"He takes her round the countryside and makes her dance. He
lives on her. Monsieur. For himself, he does nothing."</p>

<p>"The old man with the tambourine?"</p>

<p>"Exactly, Monsieur,"</p>

<p>I thanked her and went down to the common room of the inn. I
made inquiries and found that Denise and her father had gone on. A
mood of melancholy came over me, as though I had lost my dearest
friend. I ate my dinner in silence. Half-way through I pushed my
plate away and went and sat out at the table pleasantly placed
under the trees of the orchard. I sipped my coffee and dreamed of
the little dancer. Three men came and occupied the table next to
mine. We were the only occupants of the garden. I paid little
attention to them, though I was conscious that one was a large,
red-faced man who, judging by his remarks, was a traveller for a
firm of spirit merchants; the other two were local tradesmen. When
they had consumed several liqueurs their conversation became
louder, and I could not help overhearing it. Suddenly I became
aware that the large, red-faced man had made an unspeakable
reference. He was laughing bucolically, and he said something which
I cannot repeat. It referred to Denise. I am a hot-tempered man,
and I sprang to my feet.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you&mdash;unspeakable traducer, you!" I cried, and I
flung the contents of a glass pitcher of water full in his
face.</p>

<p>I will not recall all the details of that distressing episode.
We were all blind with rage. With the apple blossoms falling all
around us and the birds singing in the trees, we fought&mdash;the
four of us&mdash;among the marble-topped tables and the chairs.
People rushed out of the inn and separated us, but not before I had
knocked the large man senseless and flung him among the
rhododendron bushes. Denise did not know, and never has known, that
I had constituted myself her champion, or the price that I paid for
it. For in the struggle I cut my wrist upon a broken wine glass. It
bled profusely. In the night I became delirious, and a surgeon was
sent for. I developed blood-poisoning. For days I lay in a critical
condition in the bedroom of the inn. And then my old father came to
see me. I shall never forget his coming. You must know that my
father was devoted to me. He had an exaggerated idea of my
character and abilities. My mother had died when I was a small boy,
and my father wrapped his life round mine. He spoilt me in every
way. I could do nothing wrong.</p>

<p>I can see him now as he came shuffling into the room, thrusting
out his thin arms, and mumbling:</p>

<p>"My little boy...my brave heart!"</p>

<p>He would never believe that I was more than a little boy,
although he entrusted me with all the affairs of his estates. He
was educating me in the law, and had a great idea that I was to get
into the Senate. Of the origin of my quarrel we said nothing. I do
not know how much he learnt, but I know that the traveller in
spirits, who was clamouring to set the law on me, was squared. I
saw or heard nothing more of him. It was five weeks before I was
well enough to get about, and by that time the position between my
father and myself became reversed. He was the invalid, and I was
well enough to look after him. As a matter of fact, he ought never
to have travelled. He was very unwell when he started, and it was
only the nervous anxiety and his affection for me which kept him
going. When I began to recover, he collapsed. His heart was in an
extremely enfeebled state.</p>

<p>One evening I was seated at my window. The sun was setting in a
blaze of glory. The fruit blossoms were over, but the bees were
busy among the irises and roses. Suddenly I saw my father enter the
garden. He was carrying a rug. I was about to call out to him, but
somehow I felt constrained to watch him instead. He walked ever so
slowly, dragging one foot after the other. He stood amidst the
flowers, looking round. Then he appeared to sigh, and with great
deliberation he chose a spot under a young birch-tree. He spread
out the rug and lay himself down, facing the setting sun. I don't
know how it was, but his movements fascinated me. They were so
incredibly slow and so elaborate. It appeared to be so important to
choose the exact spot. His thin, straight figure lay so still...so
very still. Something seemed to tell me that my father was
disappointed in me. It was the <i>mise-en-scéne</i> of our little
tragedy. I watched him for twenty minutes, and he did not move;
then, leaning out of the window, I called gently:</p>

<p>"Father...Father!"</p>

<p>And he gave no sign. I darted back into the room. I was
frightened. I felt my heart beating. I sat trembling on the side of
the bed. After a long interval I went back to the' window and again
called:</p>

<p>"Father...Father!"</p>

<p>And the rigid figure remained inert. Then stealthily I crept
down the stairs. I walked across the lawn on tiptoe. I touched my
father's shoulder, and he did not wake. A wood-pigeon cooed
melodiously up above in the branches of an elm. The bees droned in
the young flowers, and the sun went down.</p>

<p>Three months later I was in Paris, studying for the Bar. My
father had left me a comparatively rich man, and the heir to great
ambitions. His name was to be perpetuated upon the scrolls of fame
with the names of the best sons of France. I had not seen Denise
again, and I had tried to dismiss her from my memory. I occupied
luxurious quarters in the Rue Ambrosine, and I was attended by an
old concierge and a valet named Canot. I passed my preliminary
examination with comparative ease, and the work interested me. I
moved in society of various sorts, and indulged in the orthodox
pleasures of my kind.</p>

<p>It was nearly three years later that I again met Denise.</p>

<p>I recognised her at once. It was at Dieppe. I had failed in my
final examinations for the Bar. Something went wrong at the end. I
failed badly. Discouraged and crestfallen, I had gone away with a
party of friends, amongst whom was Monsieur Léon Castille, the
Deputy! He was a good friend to me. He believed in me and trusted
me in my darkest hour. He insisted that there was a great career
for me in the political world. We motored through Brittany and
Picardy. At Dieppe we stayed at the Hotel de l'Univers.</p>

<p>One night after dinner I strolled through the back of the town
alone. I wanted to escape from people of my own world I went into a
little cabaret. It was quite amusing. I have always contended that
the humble cabarets supply better entertainment than the
much-advertised vaudevilles on the English and American plan. I had
no programme, but half-way through a roar of welcome greeted what
was evidently a popular number. The orchestra struck up a
bowdlerised edition of Mendelssohn's Spring Song. The lights went
up. The scene was set with a green cloth background. And suddenly
the joyous figure of Spring itself danced before my eyes. For a
second I wondered where I had experienced this before, and then the
whole thing came back to me&mdash;the pleasure-garden at
Couturet-en-bois! I sat entranced, clutching the arms of my
fauteuil. At the end of the performance I sent round my card.
Almost immediately I was admitted and shown to Mademoiselle's
dressing-room. Two other actresses were with her and a snuffly old
man, whom I recognised as her father.</p>

<p>Denise was examining my card quizzically, and her eyes were
still shining with the excitement of the dance. I bowed, and
said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle, pray forgive me. I had the great pleasure of
watching you dance, three years ago, at an inn at Couturet-en-bois.
Since then I have not had the good fortune to enjoy such an
experience until to-night."</p>

<p>She gave a little cry and looked at me.</p>

<p>"Oh, Monsieur," she cried, "you are extremely gracious."</p>

<p>"May I take the liberty," I hastened to add, "of congratulating
you on your well-deserved success, and of prophesying that even
greater laurels are awaiting you in the temples of
Terpsichore."</p>

<p>One of the actresses laughed at my rather stilted phrases, but
Denise did not take her eyes from mine. Her lips were parted, and
she smiled with friendly wonder. The old man snuffled at my elbow,
and mumbled:</p>

<p>"Some other time, Monsieur. We are engaged for tonight."</p>

<p>What did the old fool mean? I bowed to him and tried to wither
him with a glance. But Denise held out her hand.</p>

<p>"It is extremely kind of you, Monsieur," she said. "I remember
Couturet-en-bois so well. I was born near there. We are staying at
the Rue Bazin, number 47B. It would be so agreeable if Monsieur
would call one morning, and we could discuss the dear country which
I love."</p>

<p>I felt myself blushing as I bowed above her hand. I murmured my
enchantment at the invitation, and promised to call on the morrow.
When I had closed the door I heard the sound of shrill laughter
coming from within. But I knew it was not Denise who laughed.</p>

<p>And on the morrow my convictions were confirmed. I knew that
whatever feelings Denise might entertain towards me she would not
be likely to laugh at me. In the stuffy little apartment of the Rue
Bazin she treated me with a kind of surprised interest. We said
very little. We were like old friends who had known each other for
a long time, and suddenly discovered some new and amazing
revelation of sympathy. She told me of her struggles and ambitions,
and I told her mine. Her disgusting father hovered in the
background like a timid dealer at a sale of second-hand
furniture.</p>

<p>Three days later she was leaving for Amiens, and I managed to
see her once again. I gave her my card. She was to be in Paris in
the autumn at the time when I was putting up for the Senate. She
promised to come and see me. I cannot account for my lack of
enterprise at the time; perhaps our acquaintanceship had been too
brief. I was very young, schooled to a meticulous recognition of
the conventions. I may have been afraid she would misunderstand me,
and that I was taking an unfair advantage of her. But I know that
last morning, as we walked along the <i>plague</i>, and her eyes
reflected the restless movements of the sea&mdash;I knew that I
loved her, and there would never be any other woman for me. And I
could not bring myself to say it. I let her go, the old melancholy
gnawing at my heart.</p>

<p>And that evening I experienced one of the most distressing and
disconcerting moments of my life.</p>

<p>I could not go to the cabaret. My friends had made other social
engagements for the party, and the old tyrant of convention still
controlled me. When I arrived back at the hotel just before
midnight, I found old Floquet waiting for me in the hall. He stood
up as I entered, and indicated that he wanted to speak to me out in
the street. The old rascal had been drinking, without a doubt. He
mumbled to himself and tugged at my arm. When we arrived in an
unlighted corner of the promenade I asked him his business. He said
something about Mademoiselle, but I could not hear very distinctly.
He was almost incoherent. I asked if he had any message for me from
her. He nodded and winked mysteriously. Suddenly he said quite
clearly:</p>

<p>"The price will be a thousand francs,"</p>

<p>I clutched my cane. The promenade seemed to rock. The lights
went swinging away amongst the dim stars. I seized him by the coat
and shook him.</p>

<p>"Pardon, pardon!" he whined. "Let us say five hundred
francs."</p>

<p>He seemed to have an idea I was bargaining with him.</p>

<p>I thrust him heavily against a stone wall, and rushed back to my
hotel. When I look back upon that hour, it seems strange that I
never doubted the old man. I believed his statement that the
message from Denise was that "the price would be a thousand
francs!"</p>

<p>Alone in my room that night I suffered agonies of remorse and
disillusionment. I was like a drowning man from whom the life-belt
had been snatched away. I did not realise till that moment how I
had builded on this hope. It was to be the turning-point. The
sun-bathed meadows lay before me, and then suddenly...all was again
darkness. Two naked alternatives stood out before me. The one, to
end it all for ever. The other, to compromise; in other words, "to
pay the price." I laughed cynically as I contemplated my choice,
knowing full well I had not the courage to do the one, nor the
cruelty to do the other.</p>

<p>The following day my friends and I left for Paris. I was
occupied for the rest of the summer on literary work and
preparations for my political career. I addressed many meetings,
and was congratulated by my political colleagues. In certain moods
I certainly appeared to have the faculty of moving people. My
essays on "Currency" were commended by no less an authority than
Monsieur Duparc, of the Academy. Everything pointed to my failure
at the Bar being entirely obliterated by a more brilliant and
significant career. It would be idle to pretend that I dismissed
Denise from my mind. On the contrary, thoughts of her haunted me
day and night, but to an extent I controlled them. I steeled myself
to the idea that I should never see her again. I closed down the
shutters on that portion of my life.</p>

<p>At the end of September I experienced a great disaster. It was
at the last and most important political meeting I had to address.
The hall was packed to the ceiling. My friend Monsieur Leon
Castille occupied the chair. There was great excitement and
enthusiasm. When I was called on to address the meeting after my
friend had made a long and eloquent address, I suddenly...forgot! I
could remember nothing. I stumbled. I repeated myself. I said the
wrong thing. In the middle of a sentence I sat down.</p>

<p>I was defeated at the polls by a fairly large majority, and I
realised that <i>that</i> career was closed to me. For a long time
I could do nothing. I brooded upon my misfortune. I indulged in
social pleasures and read considerably. All my friends, with the
exception of Monsieur Castille, appeared to lose their confidence
in me. I moved out to Passy. In December I married Madame Ostrovic.
She was a Frenchwoman, but the widow of a Polish officer. If you
ask me candidly, I cannot tell you to this day why we married. We
had nothing in common at all, except that she was musical and I
myself am something of a 'cellist. We drifted together in a certain
social set, where perhaps the others bored us even more than we did
each other. Lisette Ostrovic was older than I, frivolous,
material-minded, and vain. In her way she was handsome, being tall,
dark, and well-developed, with straight firm brows and luminous
eyes.</p>

<p>We went for a protracted honeymoon to Rome, Sicily, and Algeria.
Indeed, the honeymoon was far too long. We stayed in Algeria for
nearly six months. At the end of that time I can say wthout
exaggeration that we hated each other. Poor Lisette! I am not going
to say who was right or who was wrong, but one day in Biskra we had
a terrible quarrel. I need not enter into the nature of it. It is
sufficient to say that the next morning I packed up and left her.
She told me that she forgave me, but that she never wished to see
me again.</p>

<p>It was the end of August when I arrived in Paris. The city was
deserted and very hot. I went back to my old rooms in the Rue
Ambrosine. I had some vague idea of writing a book upon
"International Problems," But when I arrived there I spent most of
my time playing the 'cello. Also I found that, owing to neglect, my
financial affairs had got into serious disorder. An attorney with
whom I had entrusted large blocks of shares and the collecting of
rents, had himself got into monetary difficulties. He came to me
one night with tears streaming down his cheeks, and confessed the
whole matter quite openly. He had appropriated certain funds of
mine to meet his own liabilities. He was in an awful muddle. Poor
old Lavalliere! I could not be angry with him. He was so
distressed. I took him into the library and gave him some
refreshment, and then I played the traumerei of Schumann to him
till he cried again. It was all very painful.</p>

<p>The following day I was sitting alone in the library, looking
through some papers, when Canot entered. He said:</p>

<p>"A young lady requests an interview with you, Monsieur."</p>

<p>I answered idly:</p>

<p>"Show her in here, if she is at all presentable, Canot; for I am
bored."</p>

<p>He retired, and in less than two minutes Denise was standing
before me.</p>

<p>I was so moved I could not get my voice. She bowed, and
said:</p>

<p>"Pardon the liberty I take, Monsieur. You were good enough to
ask me to call and see you last year. I did so, but I did not have
the good fortune to find you in."</p>

<p>"But, my God!" I answered, "they never told me. Did you not
leave your name?"</p>

<p>"I did not like to, Monsieur. I did not think it of any
consequence."</p>

<p>"But, good heavens! child, don't you know&mdash;it's of
tremendous consequence. Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you tell
me?"</p>

<p>Almost blindly I groped my way towards her; then I sat down on a
chair facing her.</p>

<p>"Denise," I groaned, "if I'd only known!"</p>

<p>She did not understand me. She was a little frightened, but very
wistful and sympathetic. Her dear eyes were fixed on me with their
kind, mothering, innocent expression. She was more beautiful than
ever. How could I have believed that message? How could she be
anything but pure and noble, trusting, sublime? Why was I
distressing her like this? Why was fate so cruel? Quite
untruthfully, but with a vague idea of excusing my behaviour, I
blurted out:</p>

<p>"Someone told me you were married!"</p>

<p>A smile tickled the corners of her beautiful eyes. She
replied:</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Monsieur. Not I. On the contrary, I understand that I
have to congratulate Monsieur."</p>

<p>I shook my head, and pandering to the mood of brutal frankness
that came over me, I said:</p>

<p>"You need not do that, Denise. My marriage is a failure."</p>

<p>I observed her start, and an expression of deep sympathy clouded
her pretty face. She stood up and murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm sorry. I'm so&mdash;very, very sorry."</p>

<p>Quite roughly I seized her hands and said hoarsely:</p>

<p>"What of your father?"</p>

<p>She did not resist my rough grasp, but with a tear in her voice
she answered:</p>

<p>"My father died last year, Monsieur."</p>

<p>"Ah! Was he&mdash;cruel to you?"</p>

<p>"One does not speak ill of the dead."</p>

<p>I bowed my head. I felt ashamed. Releasing her hands, I choked
out:</p>

<p>"So you are not married? You are not engaged? You are not in
love? Tell me everything. Tell me about yourself."</p>

<p>She resumed her seat on the chair, like a little bird upon a
bough, with its wings at tension ready to fly away. She spoke quite
collectedly:</p>

<p>"No; I am heart-whole. I love my work. I have a good engagement
in Paris. Everyone is very kind to me. For the rest&mdash;I should
never marry a man I did not love and respect."</p>

<p>Love and respect! This remark did not reconcile itself with the
allusion to the thousand francs! Blind fool that I had been!</p>

<p>"Denise, Denise," I murmured, "I am lonely. Don't run away from
me. I want you to be my friend. I want you to trust me."</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<p>"Of course I trust you, Monsieur," she said simply.</p>

<p>"Call me Anton."</p>

<p>She hesitated. Tears hovered on the brink of her eyes. I
realised that I had been too precipitate. I released her hand.</p>

<p>"Or perhaps you will, one day. Let us meet again&mdash;to-day,
to-morrow."</p>

<p>The next day we drove in the Bois. She lunched with me at Fan
tin's. I called at her tiny flat and took her to the theatre.
Within a week our intimacy was complete.</p>

<p>We were like children. She called me Anton and she trusted me,
and I gave her no cause to regret her trust.</p>

<p>There began then that period of golden bliss, the ecstasy of
which lasts to this day. Life seemed to start for me all over
again. Nothing that had ever happened before was of any account. I
observed life from a new angle. I was swayed by new impulses, keen
desires, and fervid resolutions. Little actions became charged with
joy. We lived quite simply, and derived all our pleasure from the
mere contact of each other's presence. We met every day. She would
call for me, in her neat dove-grey frock. She would say:</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, are you ready?"</p>

<p>I was eager and trembling with the thousand important little
things I wanted to tell her since we had met on the previous day.
But I would be quite calm. I would reach down my hat and
answer:</p>

<p>"Yes, my little wood-pigeon, let us flutter away among the
trees."</p>

<p>And we would stroll away side by side, peeping at each other,
furtively touching each other's hands. We would sit under the trees
in the Luxembourg, and she would tell me all the latest gossip of
the theatre, and the colour her new frock was to be, and what the
<i>maitre de ballet</i> thought of her new dance, and where quite
the nicest omelettes in Picardy are to be obtained, and how she was
going to help her dresser's little boy, who was a consumptive, get
into a sanatorium in the South, and how careful I must be not to
stand in a draught when I called for her at the theatre; and it was
all so very, very&mdash;important.</p>

<p>It was the end of September when I told her that I loved her. It
was in my own room in the Rue Ambrosine. We sat facing each other,
and suddenly I took her hands and I held them over my eyes; and I
said:</p>

<p>"Denise, what are we going to do? I love you."</p>

<p>I felt her hands trembling, and she stood up. She put her arms
around my head and kissed me on the brow.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered hoarsely; "I know...I know."</p>

<p>I clung to her hands. I dared not look at her. I repeated
helplessly</p>

<p>"What are we going to do?"</p>

<p>I felt her bosom heaving. At length she raised my head and
looked into my eyes.</p>

<p>"Anton darling, you know I love you," she answered, "and I want
to do what is best for you. I want to make you happy. You do not
love your wife, and she does not love you. It cannot be good to go
on like that. At the same time I could not be content to be just
your mistress. Oh, my dear, let us just go on being good friends.
Perhaps, one day&mdash;who knows?"</p>

<p>I kissed her then for the first time, and we clung to each
other, bewildered by the sudden vortex of emotion in which we were
swirled. It was Denise at last who said:</p>

<p>"We must not go on like this, Anton. This must be the last time.
I could not bear it&mdash;"</p>

<p>In October my wife returned to Paris. She wrote to me from Passy
a formal letter concerning business matters. She expressed no wish
to see me. In effect she demanded a settlement. She had apparently
been living considerably above her means. When I had satisfied her
and settled up affairs with my defaulting attorney I found myself a
comparatively poor man. I moved to humbler quarters and sold the
bulk of my furniture. My friend, M. Castille, was good enough to
find me an appointment in the Ministry of Justice, but the salary
was small.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that this change in my fortunes seriously
affected my spirits. On the contrary, I almost welcomed it. I was
so consumed with my love for Denise that nothing else mattered, and
I was relieved that my wife showed no disposition to see me again.
I told everything to Denise, and she was very loyal and
sympathetic.</p>

<p>"So long as I have you they may take every stick of furniture,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Little one," I said, "everything will be well for us. I know my
wife, and I know that before long there will be someone else. And
then I shall be free&mdash;"</p>

<p>I was right in my prophecy with regard to the fact, but wrong
with regard to the time. It is strange how a protraction or
prolongation of time may upset the best-laid plans. In war, in
peace, in love, time is an all-powerful factor. In this duel of
hatred it was my wife who gave way in the main essential, but she
defeated me. For it was nearly four years before I received the
formal intimation that she was living with Henri Martin, and that
divorce proceedings were easily negotiable. And in the
meanwhile&mdash;No, no, no; I would not for one instant have you
imagine that Denise did not remain loyal to me; I would not have
you doubt her purity and sincerity. Four years! Day in and day out
she was my dear and true friend. She stuck to her faith, and to her
principle. She would not marry a man she did not love and
<i>respect</i>. Even in my darkest days, when I was dismissed from
the Ministry of Justice, and reached the bed-rock of my capital,
she believed in me and stuck to me. Even when I lost situation
after situation; when M. Castille deserted me; when I pawned my
furniture; when I wandered footsore through the streets of Paris,
searching for employment, she&mdash;she was the one light in my
darkness. And when everything seemed finished, when I lay alone in
the darkness under the fever, she it was who nursed me, she it was
who bought the food which kept my soul and body together&mdash;she,
the dancing-girl, out of her hard-earned savings!</p>

<p>Four years! Oh God, if it had not been so long! If at our first
meeting I had had the pluck, the courage of my impulse! She might
have saved me from myself. It was time which destroyed me. Time and
the tyranny of habit. And if in the end she left me for another, I
have no one to blame but that other self of mine, which is even now
stirring the milk-white liquid in the glass. Only the little glass
is left me. The little glass in which I see the reflection of that
drawn face. Shall I ever forget that expression in her eyes when
she first began to suspect? the strained anxiety in her voice as
she whispered:</p>

<p>Anton...Anton, what is that...in the little glass?"</p>

<p>So stir; stir gently. Let me once more peep through the little
window of the night. Nothing else is left. It was through the
little glass I found Denise, and through the little glass I lost
her. It was through the little glass I lost my father, and his
fortune, and his fair name. It was through the little glass I found
and lost my wife. It was through the little glass I lost my career,
my position, my friends...everything. And it is only through the
little glass that Denise will come back to me to-night across the
ages. Thirty years ago! And she will be still vivid and young,
fresh and gay, in her fantastic frock, with dark-red poppies in her
hair...She will hold out her arms and say:</p>

<p>"Well, Anton, are you ready?"</p>

<p>Am I ready? Oh, God!...Ay, the musicians have already arrived. I
hear the slow Spanish dance; the carnival is commencing. And no one
at the carnival will dance like my Denise. And I shall hold her in
my arms, and she will be mine, mine, mine!</p>

<p>The particles of dust are drifting through the pale shaft of
sunlight; the shadows are deepening in the meagre room...The stove
is cold. Perhaps soon all will be darkness...darkness and silence;
or vivid lights and the movements of dancing feet.
Denise!...Denise!</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. FREDDIE FINDS HIMSELF</h2>

<p>Talent is an elusive quantity. It never does to despair
concerning the lack of it. Some people will dig, and dig, and dig,
and find nothing, and then suddenly&mdash;perhaps when they are
reaching middle-age&mdash;they will discover that they can do
something as well as, if not better than, anyone else.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that up to the age of twenty-six Freddie
Oppincott had shown any particular ability. Indeed, he was the butt
of his family, as he had been of his school. He had tried seven
different professions and had foresworn them all, or perhaps it
would be truer to say that the professions had foresworn him. In
spite of all this, Freddie was an incurable optimist. There was no
holding him. He lived with his father, his elder brother John, who
ragged him mercilessly, and his two sisters, Emma and Jane, who
mellowed their ragging with a genuine streak of affection.
Fortunately for Freddie, his father was a fairly well-to-do coal
merchant. The family lived at Highgate. Mr. Oppincott had long
since given up all hope of Freddie accomplishing anything, except
perhaps marrying a rich girl. He was by way of being good-looking,
and he could talk. Talking was certainly his one talent. But the
trouble is that to exploit talking profitably you must be able to
talk well. And that could not be said of Freddie Oppincott.</p>

<p>At the time when this story commences he had been in a state of
unemployment for two months. And then one morning he sprang the
latest bomb-shell on the family. He announced that he was going to
be a private detective!</p>

<p>Even Mr. Oppincott was forced to laugh. And Emma and Jane
said:</p>

<p>"Don't be so utterly absurd, Freddie."</p>

<p>But the matter was abeady a partial <i>fait accompli</i>. He had
taken a little room, described as an office, in Bloomsbury.</p>

<p>And in the morning paper was an advertisement worded as
follows:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Must hubby really stay at the office till
midnight? Is it really mother that wifey spends the week-ends with?
What is your partner always going to Paris for? If in doubt on all
these problems, consult Pimpleton's Detective Agency, 9, Eurydice
Street, Bloomsbury. Pimpleton never fails.</p>

<p>Freddie announced that he was Pimpleton. He was quite impervious
to the shafts of derision hurled at him by the other members of the
family. Having had a good deal of time on his hands during the last
two months, he had been reading detective stories. His mind had
become obsessed with visions of himself in a cloth cap (with ear
flaps), tracking down murderers, discovering the duchess's stolen
tiara, bringing the faithless to justice.</p>

<p>"Don't you make any mistake," he said. "I'm not such a fool as I
look."</p>

<p>"No; but even then there's a wide margin to fill up," replied
John. And Emma said sternly, in that delightfully candid manner
that characterizes family life:</p>

<p>"Freddie, you have got every quality which a detective should
not have, and you've not got a single quality that he should have.
You've no perception, no logic, no reasoning power, and, moreover,
you talk too much. You give yourself away every time you open your
mouth. Don't be a complete ass."</p>

<p>And Jane said:</p>

<p>"Why don't you <i>write</i> detective stories? It's much easier,
and far less dangerous."</p>

<p>And Papa Oppincott said:</p>

<p>"I must be off. Where are my boots? Don't smoke too many
cigarettes, Freddie, sitting in your chamber waiting for the
Countess to call."</p>

<p>And they all departed to their various vocations.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
It would be painful to record the sarcasm, gibes, and derision to
which Freddie was subjected during the ensuing ten days. It reached
a degree of cruelty that could only happen amongst people who are
really fond of each other.</p>

<p>Freddie went out and bought a cloth cap (with ear flaps). Then
he hired a roll-top desk, and littered it with papers, ink, and
pens. And then&mdash;a really bright inspiration&mdash;several
cardboard files which he labelled conspicuously, "The Lord Harridge
Case," "Mr. Jocelyn Mountjoy and others," "The Weir Case," and so
on.</p>

<p>He purchased many tins of cigarettes, and he sat at his desk all
day long, waiting for answers to his advertisement, which appeared
regularly in several daily papers. He smoked cigarettes and read
detective stories. He always had a drawer open so that if anyone
called he could slip the book away. He had a shrewd suspicion that
real detectives didn't read detective stories.</p>

<p>It was on the tenth day that the astonishing thing happened. He
had gone out to lunch and was feeling a trifle discouraged
concerning his enterprise. On returning to his "office" he found a
dark, foreign-looking gentleman reading his notice printed on the
door: "Out at lunch, back in twenty minutes."</p>

<p>The foreign gentleman started at sight of him and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pimpleton?"</p>

<p>"That's me," said Freddie.</p>

<p>"I wish to see you urgently."</p>

<p>"Come inside, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

<p>They went inside, and Freddie smuggled away <i>Jim Slooth's Last
Case</i> just in time. They both sat down, and Freddie said:</p>

<p>"Well, now, what can I do for you?"</p>

<p>The mysterious visitor looked furtively around. Then he said
confidentially:</p>

<p>"You, I believe, handled ze case concerning ze stolen bonds for
Count Tisza?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What! But my sister understood from the Baron himself on the
telephone this morning that you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, well, perhaps I did," said Freddie, realizing he had made a
bloomer. "I have so many cases, you see, I'm apt to forget." And he
glanced significantly at his labelled files.</p>

<p>The foreigner glanced at the files, too, and seemed satisfied.
Then he leant forward and tapped Freddie's knee.</p>

<p>"It does not concern that, anyway. It was only a recommendation.
My sister, the Countess Sforza, is in great trouble. Listen!"</p>

<p>Fame at last! Freddie listened.</p>

<p>"Doubtless you know of her by reputation? Hein? Well, she has
the beautiful place at Steeplehurst, in Sussex. This week she
entertains a small house-party&mdash;seven guns. The guests arrived
on Saturday last. On Sunday evening she goes to dress for dinner.
Her pearl necklace, worth thousands of pounds, is missing. A search
is made, but ze guests are not informed. Zey have all announce to
stop one veek. All ze servants has been searched, and zeir boxes
and properties. A detective arrive from Scotland Yard on ze Monday
afternoon. He passes as a guest&mdash;a Mr. Battesley. Zis is
Wednesday afternoon. So far no clue, nozing discovered."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it was a burglar," said Freddie, brightly.</p>

<p>"Zere is no sign of burglary. No one has entered ze house
unknown, or left it. Ze guests still remain. My sister&mdash;she is
in despair. She rings up Count Tisza, an old friend. 'Go to
Pimpleton,' he says; 'he'll solve ze mystery for you.' My sister
bade me come to town at once to try to persuade you to return mit
me. Zere is a train at five-ten vich gets us down in comfortable
time for dinner."</p>

<p>"All right, Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Forcer?"</p>

<p>"My name is Baron Hunyadi Sergius Szychylimski."</p>

<p>"Oh, really! I see. Well, I'll just have to go home first."</p>

<p>"Home!"</p>

<p>"Yes. I must go to Highgate and tell Dad and the others, and
then pack up. I suppose you wear evening-dress for dinner down
there, don't you?"</p>

<p>The baron seemed a little mystified. Perhaps he had
misunderstood the English of this famous detective. He said:</p>

<p>"I will meet you on ze train, zen, Mr. Pimpleton. And&mdash;one
vord!&mdash;my sister suggest zat you come as a private gentleman,
not a sportsman. Zat would give you ze excuse to hang about ven ze
others are out. She suggest you come as a professor or scientist,
or explorer. If zere is any special branch of science you have
exceeded at or&mdash;doubtless you have travelled a lot. Vat do you
suggest? Vat is your special genius?"</p>

<p>Freddie considered for some moments, then he said:</p>

<p>"Well, I'm not bad at snooker-pool."</p>

<p>"Snookerpool!" The Baron turned the word over in his brain.
Snookerpool sounded distinctly erudite. He was too polite to make
enquiries. "Goot, zen! We vill say ze eminent authority on
Snookerpool. What name shall we announce?"</p>

<p>"My name's Oppincott. I mean&mdash;why not call me Mr.
Oppincott?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Oppincott, se Snookerpoolist. Goot!"</p>

<p>Luckily for Freddie, when he got home neither his father nor
John had returned from business. The two girls were there, and he
announced with magnificent calm that he was called away on a case
to recover the Countess Forcer's pearl necklace. The girls for a
long time thought he was fooling. It was not until he had
commandeered John's evening dress, shoes, collar, tie, and splutter
brush and packed these things that they began to take him
seriously.</p>

<p>He caught the train by the skin of his teeth. He would, indeed,
have missed it, but for the fact that the Baron was waiting for him
feverishly by the booking-office, with two first-class tickets
already taken. They scrambled into the train.</p>

<p>The journey down was uneventful. Freddie talked all the time,
but it was difficult to know how far the Baron was impressed. He
wanted to talk about the case, but he got little opportunity. He
only managed to impress one thing on Freddie. He was not to make
himself known to the other detective&mdash;Mr. Battesley. The
Countess was disappointed that Mr. Battesley had so far not even
got a clue. Pimpleton was to work on his own lines, and of course
he was to have free run of the house.</p>

<p>When they arrived at Steeplehurst Towers they found two tired
colonels drinking cock-tails in the lounge hall. The rest of the
party were dressing for dinner. The Baron introduced Freddie to the
two colonels as "Mr. Oppincott, ze eminent authority on
Snoddlepole." It was fortunate that he had forgotten the word
snooker-pool, because if the matter had been put to the test either
of the tired colonels could have given Freddie fifty per cent, on
any game played on the green baize. They regarded him languidly,
either too polite or too bored to inquire what Snoddlepole was.</p>

<p>The Countess was very anxious to see Mr. Pimpleton, and he was
ushered up to her boudoir at once. He felt a little dubious about
removing his cloth cap (with ear flaps). No detective looks the
real thing without such. It was only the questioning and rather
challenging glances of the two colonels in the hall which prompted
him eventually to leave it behind.</p>

<p>The Countess was small and dark and agitated. The loss of her
pearl necklace seemed to have driven her to a frenzy of lapidary
display. She appeared to be wearing the remainder of her jewellery,
in case that too was stolen. Her knowledge of English was far more
limited than that of her brother. She began by saying:</p>

<p>"I spik English bad. My brozzer tell you of the lost pearl. Zis
man, Battesley, he find nozing. It ees to you I look now. Zese
guests depart Saturday. Zis is Vednes-day. Ze house is disposed to
you. Inquire, look, search as you vill. One vord also. Ze Baron and
I, ve know of zis. No von else. Not even my daughter."</p>

<p>"Righto," said Freddie.</p>

<p>She came up to him and said, tensely:</p>

<p>"Listen. In ze short vile ze bell gongs to dinner. You gom to
dinner? Or no? You stay here, perhaps, search ze guests' effects
vile we hold zem at dinner? Perhaps you have dinner after by
yourself. Hein?"</p>

<p>By the base of the hall staircase Freddie's nostrils had been
assailed by an aroma that might have been roast pheasant, or it
might have been roast quail. He was hungry. He replied:</p>

<p>"No, I think I'll start making my depositions after dinner,
Countess. Work like mine can't be done on an empty stomach."</p>

<p>He did not quite know what "depositions" meant, but it was a
word he had frequently come across in <i>Jim Slooth's Last
Case</i>. It apparently impressed the Baron too, for he repeated,
"he makes depositions," and he translated it into the rummy lingo
they spoke between them. The Countess appeared satisfied, and he
was allowed to retire to his room and to put on John's evening
clothes.</p>

<p>When he found himself seated at the dining-table, after having
been introduced to the company as Mr. Toddingpot, the eminent
authority on Snoddlepole, he rejoiced that he had made this
decision. In the first place, the dinner was unbelievably good. He
had never imagined such foods and wines existed. In the second
place, he found himself sitting next to the daughter of the house.
She was an extremely pretty girl, with dark, mischievous eyes, and
she spoke English like a native. (He found out afterwards that she
had been educated at Girton.) He found her an enchanting listener.
There were nearly twenty guests seated round the table, and the
noise of conversation was so loud that he almost had to shout into
her ear. They were eating red mullet, when she suddenly said:</p>

<p>"I'm most thrilled that you are an authority on Snoddlepole, Mr.
Toddingpot."</p>

<p>"Oppincott is my name," said Freddie, in order to gain time.</p>

<p>"Of course. I'm so sorry. By the way, do you consider the
Einstein theory is going to affect the practice of
Snoddlepole?"</p>

<p>It was obvious that this was a dangerous woman. He was not going
to enjoy himself so much as he had hoped. The only way to treat
this onslaught was to counter it by asking questions of his own. He
said, "No" rapidly, and almost in the same breath:</p>

<p>"Are you Oxford or Cambridge?"</p>

<p>"Cambridge."</p>

<p>"Good! I'm so glad. So am I. Can you float?"</p>

<p>"What? Companies?"</p>

<p>"You're pulling my leg, Miss Forcer."</p>

<p>"You're asking for it, Mr. Hottentot."</p>

<p>There was a lot of fun in this girl. If she would only talk
sensibly, about lawn tennis, for instance, or music-halls, or
tobacco, he could have a good time with her.</p>

<p>He found himself eating pheasant when he suddenly remembered
that he was a detective. He had to discover which of these guests
had stolen the pearl necklace. He glanced round the table. A more
unthieving-looking crowd had surely never foregathered. They all
looked well-off, well-fed, and slightly vacant, entirely innocent
of anything except the knowledge of what is done or what is not
done. Stealing pearl necklaces is not done. No, there was only one
saturnine-looking individual present at all. He was seated in the
far corner.</p>

<p>"Who is that chap over there?" Freddie asked his neighbour.</p>

<p>"That's Mr. Battesley."</p>

<p>The real detective! That was no go, then. But still, you never
could tell. A sleek exterior sometimes concealed an itching palm.
That wasn't right. He was mixing things a bit, especially wines. He
would have to keep a clear head for the great work in front of him.
Depositions, eh?</p>

<p>When the dinner was over and the ladies had retired, Freddie
realized that this was a good opportunity for him to commence his
work. He went stealthily out of the dining-room. He had reached the
foot of the stairs when he heard a quiet voice behind say:</p>

<p>"Mr. Oppincott!"</p>

<p>He turned. It was Battesley, the detective. An uncomfortable
feeling crept over him. He had been told not to have anything to do
with his rival. But there was a sense of power about this man a
little difficult to ignore. The detective said:</p>

<p>"May I have a word with you in the billiard-room?"</p>

<p>Freddie hesitated.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind playing you fifty up, but I've got some work
to do."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, of course," said Battesley, and led the way in.
Having shut the door, he turned to Freddie and said:</p>

<p>"I have received information that you are a private detective
that has been sent for at the Countess's direction. Here is my
card. You know my mission here. The Countess is a very
highly-strung woman, a little impetuous. I think it will be to the
advantage of all parties concerned, and most likely to be conducive
of results if we work together."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know," said Freddie, weakly.</p>

<p>"I am quite prepared to place at your disposal all the
information I have so far acquired," continued the detective,
ignoring Freddie's protest. "The Countess was wearing the necklace
on the evening of the twelfth. On retiring to bed she locked the
necklace up in her jewel cabinet On the following evening, when she
went to put it on, she found it to be missing."</p>

<p>"Well, I never!" said Freddie.</p>

<p>"The key of the cabinet she kept in her chatelaine, which she
carried about with her all day. No one could have entered her
bedroom during the night. The doors were locked. The key must have
been taken from her chatelaine during the day and replaced. The
Countess says that, so far as she can remember, the chatelaine was
never out of her sight. Of course, she put it down many times, on
the piano for instance, and on the luncheon-table, but she never
observed anyone touch it. It must have been done very deftly by
someone who was near to her and very intimate."</p>

<p>"Fancy!"</p>

<p>"I have made a careful inquiry into the character and record of
everyone of the servants, and also of the guests. One of the
under-gardeners has a bad record, but he was never seen to approach
the house all day. There is no one else upon whom one would dare to
cast the slightest suspicion. But in order not to run any risks I
have; unbeknown to them, searched all their rooms, luggage, and
effects. It seems probable that, if one of the guests had taken it,
he would have made some excuse to get away as quickly as possible.
But no one has intimated any desire to leave before next
Saturday."</p>

<p>"It's extraordinary, isn't it?" said Freddie. "Perhaps she
dropped it somewhere. Did you look under the bed?"</p>

<p>"Now you are a young man," the detective continued. "And I
observed that you were not altogether repulsed in your attentions
to the daughter of the house, Miss Olga Szychyllmski. It is there
that I think we may stumble on some solution."</p>

<p>"The daughter! You don't mean to say that you think she pinched
it?"</p>

<p>"You may have observed that the Countess and her daughter are
hardly on speaking terms. There has been a row. The daughter wishes
to marry a profligate young man named Julius Stinnie. The mother
won't hear of it. She has not even informed her daughter about the
necklace. This young man has been forbidden the house, but he
haunts the neighbourhood. The daughter meets him
clandestinely."</p>

<p>"Well, you do surprise me!" exclaimed Freddie. "I thought she
seemed a top-hole girl&mdash;a bit too clever, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I am, of course, working entirely on a supposition. The young
man has no money and is a rout Nevertheless, he is well-connected.
He would probably be able to dispose of a pearl necklace among some
of his associates. Whether he has been able to persuade the
daughter to connive at the theft remains to be seen. Whether it was
she who actually removed the necklace and passed it on to him
remains to be proved, but no one has more intimate knowledge of the
Countess's movements and habits, or an easier access to her person.
I have tried to make friends with her, but she repulses me. That is
where I think you might succeed. She has obviously taken to you.
You could keep her under observation. Take her out on the river,
pump her, make love to her if you like."</p>

<p>Oh, if only John could hear all this! He, the despised Freddie,
being appealed to by a real detective, and urged to make love to
the daughter of a countess! A glow of manliness crept over him. He
wanted to say:</p>

<p>"Yes, we professionals must stick together. I will sacrifice
myself. The girl shall be made love to."</p>

<p>And yet he did not like Battesley. There was something hard,
cruel, and forbidding about the man. It seemed shabby to make love
to a girl in order to worm secrets out of her. It seemed shabbier
to get someone else to do it for you. The manliness wavered.</p>

<p>"I will think over what you say, Mr. Battesley," and he bowed in
quite a dignified manner and left the room.</p>

<p>In the morning he wondered whether the other detective had told
him the story to put him off the scent. If he went punting about
the river with Olga he would be out of the way, and the coast would
be clear for Battesley, to do as he liked. Ha, ha! No, he was not
going to be taken in like that. He went down to breakfast
determined to act on his own. But how? He hadn't the faintest idea
how to begin. Thank goodness, Battesley had searched all these
people's private rooms and effects. It would save him from a most
distasteful task.</p>

<p>After breakfast the Countess sent for him.</p>

<p>"Veil?" she said. "You make some discover? Yes?"</p>

<p>"Not yet," replied Freddie. "I am making my depositions. I have
several people under close observation."</p>

<p>"No clue yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet?"</p>

<p>"Veil, the house is disposed to you. It is urgent. I trust
you."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Countess, you'll have no cause to ultimately regret
it," said Freddie, splitting his infinitive with a magnificent
gesture.</p>

<p>In the garden he found Olga among the phlox and campion. She
looked wickedly attractive.</p>

<p>"Good-morning, Mr. Oddinglot," she said. "Come for a little punt
up the reach, will you?"</p>

<p>Now this was just what he had decided not to do. It was what
Battesley wanted him to do&mdash;to get rid of him. His duty was to
hang about the house and search for the pearl necklace. Great
bumble bees hung heavily on the phlox. The air was filled with
their droning, and with the song of birds, and the distant lowing
of cattle.</p>

<p>"I should love to," he said.</p>

<p>In half-an-hour's time they were gliding up a backwater.
Fortunately he could punt&mdash;not very well, but sufficiently
well to get the boat along. He slowed up among the reeds and
rested.</p>

<p>"Now I want you to tell me all about Snoddlepole," she said.</p>

<p>Freddie lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact," he replied, after a lengthy pause, "I'd
rather not talk about Snoddlepole. When I'm on a holiday I like to
get away from it."</p>

<p>"Are you on a holiday?" she said. Olga was one of those
ingenuous girls who exude omniscience, or if there is something
they do not know, you are not going to find out. Her dark eyes
mocked him.</p>

<p>"I'm having a very nice holiday, thank you," he said,
simply.</p>

<p>She laughed. "Tell me all about yourself. You amuse me."</p>

<p>This was the kind of invitation Freddie liked. Without any
preamble he told her ah about Dad and John and Emma and Jane, about
his own chequered career right up to the time when he became a
detective.</p>

<p>"And what are you doing now?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I'm resting on my punt pole," he answered.</p>

<p>Oh, very clever, Master Freddie! He was feeling extremely happy
and pleased with himself.</p>

<p>"This is all very interesting," the girl said. "Only,
considering what a lot of things you've crowded into your brilliant
career, I don't see how you could have found time to become an
authority of Snoddlepole."</p>

<p>"Look here," answered Freddie, "that's all nonsense&mdash;it's a
mistake. I don't even know what Snoddlepole is."</p>

<p>The punt shook with the girl's laughter.</p>

<p>"What I want to know is&mdash;what are you doing here? Mother
doesn't know you. Uncle doesn't know you. None of the guests knows
anything about you. Uncle went up and fetched you from town, and
now you don't even know what Snoddlepole is!"</p>

<p>She was too clever for him. She was manoeuvring to defend her
lover, of course, the man who had stolen the necklace.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to go away?" he said, not without
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I like you. It's jolly to have someone really young and
innocent about the place."</p>

<p>Little devil! "I think we'll push on a bit."</p>

<p>They did not get back till lunch-time; the girl, mischievous and
provocative; the boy, bewildered and fascinated.</p>

<p>"I'll play you at tennis this afternoon," she said.</p>

<p>"She doesn't mean to leave me alone," he thought. "Oh,
well&mdash;"</p>

<p>After lunch the Countess sent for him.</p>

<p>"Veil, have you any clue yet?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, Countess, but I have every hope."</p>

<p>"Is there anyone you suspect?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather not say for the moment."</p>

<p>"Bien!"</p>

<p>Battesley nodded at him approvingly as he entered the
luncheon-room. Most of the elder men were out shooting and would
not be back until the evening. During the course of lunch Freddie
decided that Battesley was right. It was this girl's lover who had
stolen the necklace. Her whole manner indicated it. She suspected
him of being there as a spy and she was going to look after him.
Instead of him spying upon her, she was going to spy upon him. She
had him in her clutches. Well, he wouldn't play tennis with her. He
would refuse. He would begin to make his own researches. But-? It
seemed much more difficult to be a detective than the story-books
had led one to suspect. This man Battesley apparently worked on a
system. He would go up to his own room after lunch and think the
whole thing out.</p>

<p>When the rest arose from the table he avoided Olga's glance,
slid out of the room, and dashed upstairs and locked his door. He
then remembered that he had never sent a postcard home, as
promised. So he wrote, saying that he had arrived, that he had not
yet traced the Countess's necklace, but that he was getting
together some important information and hoped to trace the thief by
Saturday, when he returned. (He afterwards put this postcard on the
hall table with some other letters for the post.)</p>

<p>He had just written his postcard when there was a knock at the
door. He opened it. It was Olga. She said demurely:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Loppinott, I'm so sorry to disturb you, but a young
couple have just arrived and want to play tennis. I <i>do</i> wish
you would come and make up a four. There is no one else."</p>

<p>What was he to do? He played tennis till tea-time. The young
couple departed, and then Olga said:</p>

<p>"Now, wouldn't you like to take me on the river again?"</p>

<p>No. A thousand times, no! She touched him ever so gently on the
forearm.</p>

<p>"You had better put on your sweater. It sometimes gets suddenly
chilly in the evening."</p>

<p>A starling was making an awful to-do up in the apple tree.</p>

<p>"Right. Oh, thanks awfully. Of course I would."</p>

<p>When he found himself once more among the reeds up that
backwater, and Olga was playfully letting the stream trickle
through her white fingers, he knew that the reason he wanted to
avoid her was that if it were true that her lover had stolen the
necklace, he didn't want to be the one instrumental in discovering
the fact. He didn't want to be associated with anything that would
give her pain. Indeed, he wanted to bring her joy and happiness. He
wanted to take her in his arms and say:</p>

<p>"I love you. I love you. I love you." Or words to that
effect.</p>

<p>Her face caught the reflected glitter from the water. She was
wearing most exquisite open-work silk stockings.</p>

<p>"I'm not cut out for a detective," he thought to himself.</p>

<p>"Well, my pensive friend?" she said, after he had been gazing at
her abstractedly for at least five minutes.</p>

<p>"Life's a rummy go," he said, dolefully.</p>

<p>"It is, indeed," agreed she, eagerly. "Your perspicacity leaves
me breathless."</p>

<p>As though accepting that as a challenge, Freddie stumbled across
the punt and sat in the seat facing her. Her eyes were watching him
questioningly. He took his courage in both hands and both her
hands. He said:</p>

<p>"I shan't want to go back on Saturday."</p>

<p>She made no attempt to withdraw hers. She looked at him
quizzically.</p>

<p>"Won't you? But your mission will be accomplished."</p>

<p>"What mission?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot you're just here on a holiday, Mr. Polyglot."</p>

<p>"Be serious with me for five minutes. This fellow you're engaged
to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>She withdrew her hands. Her eyes narrowed.</p>

<p>"I know all about it. You're going to marry that chap Julius
Stinnie."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be fair to say."</p>

<p>The expression of her face suddenly changed. She spoke rather
bitterly.</p>

<p>"Since it seems to interest you, I'll tell you the truth. I'm
not going to. It's off. I found out things that&mdash;well, anyway,
it's off."</p>

<p>Freddie's mentality received various shocks. Firstly, a shock of
exultation. If Julius Stinnie was off, why should not Freddie be
on? Secondly, but a much milder shock, a shock to his professional
vanity as a detective. He was on the wrong track. He was doing just
what Battesley wanted him to do&mdash;wasting two days making love
to the daughter of the house, and it was all on a false scent. He
registered a mental vow of revenge against Battesley. He must give
this girl up and return to the fray.</p>

<p>He certainly did return, but it was nearly dark when the punt
glided into the boat-house. The lawn was damp with evening dew, and
the girl's hair was all awry.</p>

<p>The position, he now realized, would soon be getting desperate.
After dinner another bright idea. He asked the Baron if he might
see him and the Countess alone. Naturally. They received him in the
boudoir.</p>

<p>"Please show me the key of the jewel-case at once, will
you?"</p>

<p>The Countess produced it. He turned it over, held it up to the
light, and repeated, "Ah!" three times. The Countess was very
impressed.</p>

<p>"Veil?"</p>

<p>"I can say nothing more to-night. To-morrow I hope to spring a
surprise&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Vat ees dat?"</p>

<p>"He springs a surprise to-morrow," explained the Baron.</p>

<p>Freddie appeared to be thinking profoundly. He said "Ah!" once
more, and left the room without another word.</p>

<p>"This will be difficult to follow up," he thought, as he went
downstairs, not having the faintest idea what his various "Ahs!"
implied.</p>

<p>He found Olga in the drawing-room with the rest of the party.
She was in a high-spirited, ragging mood. He could not detach her
from the rest. Her mocking laughter jarred him. He did not
understand her. She was never serious for a moment. It was the
first time he had met a girl of this kind. He was bewitched by her,
and at the same time she made him feel wretched. Before the others
she went out of her way to make him look a fool. And yet on the
river&mdash;</p>

<p>He retired early and lay in bed trying to evolve "depositions."
If only the Countess didn't keep on demanding clues! In the stories
he had read they were usually footprints, or hairpins, or tobacco
pouches. In any case, something solid. On the morrow he simply must
find a clue. It would be his last chance. He slept at last,
dreaming of the perfume of dark hair and of some very expensive and
mysterious scent.</p>

<p>The next day was finer than ever. A thin mist hung over
everything, presaging heat to come. After breakfast the Countess
sent for him as usual. He experienced the familiar sensation of the
schoolboy being hauled up before the headmaster for not learning
his prep.</p>

<p>"Veil?"</p>

<p>How sick he was of it!</p>

<p>"To-day I expect to find a clue," he said.</p>

<p>"He expects to find a clue," echoed the Baron.</p>

<p>The Countess was looking annoyed and a little suspicious.</p>

<p>"To-morrow they go," she snapped.</p>

<p>"You may rely upon me, Countess," wheedled Mr. Freddie, his mind
concentrated on a last day on the river.</p>

<p>But Olga didn't want to go on the river. She took him for a walk
over a common. He was deliciously happy. Away from the others she
was quite amenable and rather more than friendly. She did not
object to his squeezing her hand, putting his arm round her waist,
and on two occasions kissing her. Beyond that there seemed to be a
kind of blank wall. He could not think of the right thing to say.
She never attempted to talk to him seriously. She was amusing
herself with him.</p>

<p>It took Freddie the whole morning to realize this, and when he
did he felt desperate. He was madly in love with her, and she was
as intangible as a myth.</p>

<p>Lunch was a dismal meal. He almost made up his mind to confess
to the Countess and to return to town forthwith. But the lunch was
a very excellent lunch, and afterwards he felt fortified. He
strolled out into the rose-garden, sat on a bench in the sun, and
smoked. It seemed a shame to have to leave all this. That wretched
Countess with her clues! He simply must find something.</p>

<p>Suddenly he saw her coming in his direction through the pergola.
He looked desperately around. The only solid thing that caught his
eye was a small garden trowel. He stooped and picked it up. As she
approached him, he went up to her and handed her the trowel.</p>

<p>"Look, Countess," he said. "I have found a clue."</p>

<p>And without giving her time to ask questions, he hurried away in
the direction of the house. He found Olga near the boat-house.</p>

<p>"Come," he said, "for the last time. Down the river. You
must."</p>

<p>She was carried away by his decisiveness, and in a short while
they were gliding away down the river. And they had a very pleasant
afternoon. Pleasant, in that youth is pleasant, and a sunny day.
And dalliance is pleasant under a willow tree with the water
musically lapping the sides of a punt. And it is pleasant to hold
hands and to imagine that one is in love&mdash;if only for an hour.
It is pleasant to believe that; life is perpetuated in a gesture.
To the girl it was a pleasant pastime. To the young man a desperate
spiritual adventure. He knew that nothing would come out of it, and
he didn't care. He saw himself clear and whole for the first time.
During the most intriguing moments of this new ecstasy he was
registering a vow to improve himself, to work, to learn, to study.
He would go back and begin life anew.</p>

<p>"I love you so much that I am going to give you up," he
said.</p>

<p>"Before you talk of giving up, you must first postulate
possession," she answered.</p>

<p>He didn't know the meaning of the word "postulate," so he kissed
her lips, presumably in order to close them.</p>

<p>He decided to catch the six-fifteen back to town, and so, in
spite of her protests, he manfully guided the punt back to
Steeplehurst boat-house in time for tea. On arriving at the house,
one of the servants told him that the Baron wished to see him in
the rose-garden.</p>

<p>"My doom!" he thought. However, he went eagerly enough thither,
anxious to get the whole thing over. He saw the Baron in
conversation with an old man with white hair. As he entered the
garden the Baron exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Oppincott, Count Tisza himself has come over to see
us."</p>

<p>The old Count came forward and then started at sight of
Freddie.</p>

<p>"But this is not Ponderton!" he said.</p>

<p>"Ponderton?" said the Baron. "Ponderton? Did you not say
Pimpleton on ze 'phone?"</p>

<p>"Pimpleton! No, Ponderton. Ponderton, the great detective. Who
is this fellow?"</p>

<p>It was an embarrassing position, but it was relieved in a most
astonishing manner. The Countess came hurrying down the grass path.
Within earshot she cried out:</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Pimpleton! Mr. Pimpleton!"</p>

<p>The three men turned. The Countess came up. In her right hand
she held out a pearl necklace.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Pimpleton! how can I zank you?"</p>

<p>"But zis is not Pimpleton," cried the Baron. "I mean it is
Pimpleton. It is not Ponderton.</p>

<p>"Who vas Ponderton?"</p>

<p>"It should be Ponderton, but it is Pimpleton."</p>

<p>"I know nozing. But I know it is he who find ze necklace.
Listen, you all. I know not how Mr. Pimpleton or Mr. Ponderton
work, on vat lines, no. But he zink, and zink, and zink, for two
days. He not poke about like zis Battesley. He keep quiet and hide.
And then, lo! presto! he find ze clue quick."</p>

<p>"How do you mean?" exclaimed the Baron.</p>

<p>"Listen. Zis afternoon I find him here zinking in zis garden. I
goes to him. He gives me a little&mdash;vat you call?&mdash;trowel!
He says, 'Look here, ze clue!' Zen he go away. I hold ze trowel in
my hand and I zink also. And suddenly it all come back to me. It
was here in zis garden on ze Saturday ven ze pearls was stolen. I
had put my chatelaine down on ze zeat here, so! Zey call to me to
go to ze telephone. Ven I gom back I zee zat man, Ben Burnett, ze
unter-gartener. He vas vorking quite near in ze beds. I zink he
give me one funny look, but I take no notice. Ze chatelaine vas as
it is! So! I zink no more about zis until just so soon. Ven I see
ze trowel it all gom back. I suspicion him with certainty. I go
right down quick to his cottage. I go in. He is there vis his wife,
I accuse him. I say, 'Vere is ze necklace you vas taken?' He says,
no, but his wife burst vif tears. Zen I know. He too quite vite he
goes. He bends ze knee. He tells me all. He vas vat you say, a
tickets-of-leave man. He vas a bad man. But he lives straight,
vasn't it? He implores forgiveness. His wife cries. She will ruin
herself if he is taken. I give vay. I am weak. I restore me the
necklace. I fogive him. I am so happy. Oh, Mr. Pondleton, how can I
zank you?"</p>

<p>"I only did my duty," said Freddie, quickly.</p>

<p>"You will stay mit us over ze week-end, shust as a guest?
Yes?"</p>

<p>"Alas, no," answered Freddie. "I must catch the six-fifteen. I
have another urgent case."</p>

<p>"Veil, veil!" cried the Baron. "I must congratulate you, Mr.
Pinderton. Perhaps I was fortunate after all to make zis mistake on
ze telephone, eh, Count?"</p>

<p>The Count was annoyed, but he shrugged his shoulders and bowed
politely to Freddie.</p>

<p>He did not see Olga again. Close by the box-hedge near the
summer-house he heard her laughter, and her merry voice calling
out, "Fifteen-forty!"</p>

<p>She was playing a single with the curate.</p>

<p>"It's a rum, funny life," he thought, as he sat back in the
corner of a first-class carriage going back to London. In his
breast-pocket was a cheque for one hundred pounds.</p>

<p><br>
<br>
All this happened three years ago. It seems strange that after his
brilliant start in the career of a private detective he no longer
follows that calling. Indeed, he never received another
commission.</p>

<p>He is now running a little shop where he sells foreign postage
stamps, and is doing fairly well. He is married to a little girl,
the daughter of an ironmonger. She is not clever, nor even pretty,
but she has redeeming qualities. One is that she adores Freddie.
She thinks he is handsome, loyal, and clever. She is enormously
proud of him, and she believes in his story about the recovery of
the Countess's pearls. Perhaps that is because he told her the
truth about it. He also told the truth about it to John and Emma
and Jane, but so embellished was it with romantic tissues that the
Father of Lies himself might almost have claimed it as his own.
What would you? A man must defend himself.</p>
