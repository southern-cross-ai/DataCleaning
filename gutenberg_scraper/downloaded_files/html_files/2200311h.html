<p class="note">&ldquo;That small, small, imperceptible<br>
  Small talk! that cuts like powdered glass<br>
  Ground in Tophana, &mdash; who can tell<br>
Where lurks the power the poison has?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is the desolation of riches as well as the desolation  of poverty &mdash; the empty splendour of a large house in which there is no going and  coming of family life, no sound of light footsteps and youthful laughter &mdash; only  spacious rooms and fine furniture, and one solitary figure moving silently amidst  the vacant grandeur. This sense of desolation, of a melancholy silence and emptiness,  came upon Lady Perivale on her return to the mansion in Grosvenor Square, which  was among the numerous good things of this world that had fallen into her lap, seven  years ago, when she made one of the best matches of the season.</p>
<p>She had not sold herself to an unloved suitor. She had  been sincerely attached to Sir Hector Perivale, and had sincerely mourned him when,  after two years of domestic happiness, he died suddenly, in the prime of life, from  the consequences of a chill caught on his grouse moor in Argyleshire, where he and  his young wife, and a few chosen pals, made life a perpetual picnic, and knew no  enemy but foul weather.</p>
<p>This time the enemy was Death. A neglected cold turned  to pneumonia, and Grace Perivale was a widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem hard lines,&rdquo; whispered Hector, when he  knew that he was doomed. &ldquo;We have had such a good time, Grace; and it&rsquo;s rough on  me to leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No child had been born of that happy union, and Grace  found herself alone in the world at one and twenty, in full possession of her husband&rsquo;s  fortune, which was princely, even according to the modern standard by which incomes  are measured &mdash; a fortune lying chiefly underground, in Durham coalfields, secure  from change as the earth itself, and only subject to temporary diminution from strikes,  or bad times. She needed a steady brain to deal with such large responsibilities,  for she had not been born or reared among the affluent classes. In her father&rsquo;s  East Anglian Rectory the main philosophy of life had been to do without things.</p>
<p>Her husband had none but distant relations, whom he  had kept at a distance; so there were no interfering brothers or sisters, no prying  aunts or officious uncles to worry her with good advice. She stood alone, with a  castle on the Scottish border, round whose turrets the seamews wheeled, and at whose  base the German Ocean rolled in menacing grandeur, one of  the finest houses in Grosvenor Square,  and an income that was described by her friends and the gossiping Press at anything  you like between twenty and fifty thousand a year.</p>
<p>So rich, so much alone, Lady Perivale was naturally  capricious. One of her caprices was to hate her castle in Northumberland, and to  love a hill-side villa on the Italian Riviera, two or three miles from a small seaport,  little known to travellers, save as a ragged line of dilapidated white houses straggling  along the sea front, past which the Mediterranean express carried them, indifferent  and unobservant, on their journey between Marseilles and Genoa.</p>
<p>It was Lady Perivale&rsquo;s whim to spend her winters in  a spot unknown to Rumpelmeyer and fashion &mdash; a spot where smart frocks were out of  place; where royalty-worship was impossible, since not the smallest princeling had  ever been heard of there; and where for the joy of life one had only the sapphire  sea and the silvery grey of the olive woods, perpetual roses, a lawn carpeted with  anemones, sloping banks covered with carnations, palms, and aloes, orange and lemon  trees, hedges of pale pink geranium, walls tapestried with the dark crimson of the  Bougainvilliers, the delicate mauve of the wistaria; and balmy winds which brought  the scent of the flowers and the breath of the sea through the open windows.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale came back to London in April, when the  flower-girls were selling bunches of purple lilac, and Bond Street seemed as full  of lemon-coloured carriages and picture-hats as if it were June. It was the pleasant  season after Easter, the season of warm sunshine and cold winds, when some people  wore sables and others wore lace, the season of <i>bals blancs</i> and friendly dinners, before the May Drawing Room and the  first State concert, before the great entertainments which were to be landmarks  in the history of the year.</p>
<p>How empty the three drawing-rooms looked, in a perspective  of white and gold; how black and dismal the trees in the square, as Grace Perivale  stood at one of the front windows, looking out at the smooth lawns and well-kept  shrubbery, in the pale English sunlight. She thought of the ineffable blue of the  Mediterranean, the grey and green and gold and purple of the olive wood, and the  orange and lemon grove sloping down to the sea from her verandah, where the Safrano  roses hung like a curtain of pale yellow blossom over the rustic roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet there are people who like London  better than Italy,&rdquo;  she thought.</p>
<p>Two footmen came in with the tables for tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the little drawing-room,&rdquo; she said, waving them  away from the accustomed spot.</p>
<p>The spaciousness of the room chilled her. The Louis  Seize furniture was all white and gold and silvery blue &mdash; not too much gold. An  adept in the furniture art had made the scheme of colour, had chosen the pale blues  and greys of the Aubusson carpet, the silvery sheen of the satin curtains and sofa-covers.  It was all pale and delicate and intensely cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My letters?&rdquo; she asked, when the men were retiring.</p>
<p>She had slept at Dover,  and had come to London  by an afternoon train. She liked even the hotel at Dover better than this great house in Grosvenor Square. There  she had at least the sea to look at, and not this splendid loneliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she thought, with a long-drawn sigh, &ldquo;I must  plunge into the vortex again, another mill-round of lunches and dinners, theatres  and dances, park and Princes&rsquo;, Ranelagh and Hurlingham &mdash; the same things over and  over and over and over again. But, after all, I enjoy the nonsense while I am in  it, enjoy it just as much as the other people do. We all go dancing round the fashionable  maypole, in and out, left hand here, right hand there, smiling, smiling, smiling,  and quite satisfied while it lasts. We only pretend to be bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little drawing-room &mdash; twenty feet by fifteen &mdash; looked  almost comfortable. There was a bright fire in the low grate, reflected dazzlingly  in turquoise tiles, and the old-fashioned bow window was filled with a bank of flowers,  which shut out the view of the chimneys and the great glass roof over the stable-yard.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale sank into one of her favourite chairs,  and poured out a cup of tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Toujours cet azur banal</i>,&rdquo; she said to herself, as she  looked at the pale blue china, remembering a line of Copp&eacute;e&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Poor Hector chose  this turquoise because he thought it suited my complexion, but how ghastly it will  make me look when I am old &mdash; to be surrounded by a child-like prettiness &mdash; <i>vou&eacute;e  au bleu</i>, like a good little French Catholic!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler came in with her letters. Three, on a silver  salver that looked much too large for them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These cannot possibly be all, Johnson,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;Mrs.  Barnes must have the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Barnes says these are all the letters, my lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All! There must be some mistake. You had better ask  the other servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her butler and her maid had been with her in Italy &mdash;  no one else; the butler, elderly and devoted, a man who had grown up in the Perivale  family; her maid, also devoted, a native of her father&rsquo;s parish, whom she had taught  as a child in the Sunday school, when scarcely more than a child herself, not a  very accomplished attendant for a woman of fashion, but for a parson&rsquo;s daughter,  who wore her own hair and her own eyebrows, the country-bred girl was handy enough,  nature having gifted her with brains and fingers that enabled her to cope with the  complicated fastenings of modern frocks, changing every season.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale&rsquo;s letters had been accumulating for nearly  a fortnight, and her intended arrival in London  had been announced in the <i>Times</i> and a score of papers. She expected a mountain of  letters and invitations, such as had always greeted her return to civilization.</p>
<p>Of the three letters, two were circulars from fashionable  milliners. The third was from her old friend and singing mistress, Susan Rodney:  &mdash; ,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;So glad you are coming back to town, my dear Grace.  I shall call in Grosvenor Square  on Wednesday afternoon on the chance of finding you.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Ever yours affectionately, &ldquo;SUE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rodney answered every correspondent by return of  post, and never wrote a long letter.</p>
<p>Wednesday was Lady Perivale&rsquo;s afternoon at home, and  this was Wednesday. A double knock resounded through the silence of the hall and  staircase; and three minutes later the butler announced Miss Rodney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sweet old Sue,&rdquo; cried Grace, &ldquo;now this is really  too good of you. Words can&rsquo;t say how glad I am to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed each other like sisters, and then Susan  seated herself opposite her friend, and looked at her with a countenance that expressed  some strong feeling, affection mingled with sorrow &mdash; or was it pity?</p>
<p>She was Grace&rsquo;s senior by more than ten years. She was  good-looking in her strong and rather masculine way &mdash; her complexion of a healthy  darkness, unsophisticated by pearl-powder, her features rugged, but not ugly, her  eyes bright and shrewd, but capable of tenderness, her gown and hat just the right  gown and hat for a woman who walked or rode in an omnibus or a hansom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Sue, what&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; asked Grace, pouring out  her visitor&rsquo;s tea. &ldquo;Is it a particularly dull season? Is nobody entertaining?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, much as usual, I believe. I can only answer for  my own friends and patronesses &mdash; mostly Bayswater way &mdash; who are as anxious as ever  to get a little after-dinner music for nothing. They have to ask me to dinner, though.  No nonsense about that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the songs only, Sue. They want an agreeable  woman who can talk well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can chatter about most things; but I don&rsquo;t pretend  to talk. I can keep the ball rolling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Sue, you find me in a state of profound  mystification. I never was so puzzled in my life. When I was leaving Italy I wired to  my people to keep back all my letters. I was ten days on the way home; and instead  of the usual accumulation of cards and things I find one letter &mdash; yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t know you are in town,&rdquo; Sue suggested slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but they do; for I sent the announcement to the  <i>Times</i> and the <i>Post</i> a fortnight ago. I really meant to be back sooner, but the weather  was too lovely. I stopped a couple of days at Bordighera and at St. Raphael, and  I was three days in Paris  buying frocks. Not a single invitation &mdash; not so much as a caller&rsquo;s card. One would  think London was  asleep. Isn&rsquo;t it strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Sue, looking at her with an earnest,  yet somewhat furtive, scrutiny, &ldquo;it is &mdash; very &mdash; strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, don&rsquo;t let us be solemn about it. No doubt  the invitations will come pouring in now I am at home. People have been too busy  to notice my name in the papers. There are always new women for the town to run  after. Wives of diamond men from Africa or oil men from America. One cannot expect to keep one&rsquo;s  place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; assented Sue. &ldquo;Society is disgustingly fickle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not afraid of being forgotten by the people  I like &mdash; the really nice people, the pretty girls I have cultivated, and who make  a goddess of me, the clever women, worldly but large-minded &mdash; all the people I like.  I am not afraid of African competitors there. They will stick to me,&rdquo; said Grace,  with emphasis.</p>
<p>Her friend could see that she was troubled, though she  affected to take the matter easily. There was trouble in both faces, as the friends  sat opposite each other, with only the spindlelegged Louis Seize tea-table between  them; but the trouble in Susan Rodney&rsquo;s face was graver than in Lady Perivale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your winter,&rdquo; said Grace, after a pause,  during which tea-cups had been refilled, and dainty cakelets offered and declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the usual dull mechanic round; plenty of pupils,  mostly suburban; and one duchess, five and fifty, who thinks she has discovered  a magnificent contralto voice of which she was unaware till quite lately, and desires  me to develop it. We bawl the grand duet from Norma till we are both hoarse, and  then my duchess makes me stop and lunch with her, and tells me her troubles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have put it in the singular. When she talks  of her troubles she means her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue, you&rsquo;re trying to be vivacious; but there&rsquo;s something  on your mind. If it&rsquo;s any bother of your own, do tell me, dear, and let me help  you if I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My tender-hearted Grace! You always wanted to help  people. I remember your coming to me with all your little pocket-money that dreadful  morning at the Rectory when I had a wire to say my mother was dying, and had to  rush back to town. And my dear Gracie thought I should be hard up, and wanted to  help me. That&rsquo;s nearly ten years ago. Well, well! Such things live in one&rsquo;s memory.  And your father, how kind, how courteous he always was to the holiday music-mistress,  and what a happy time my summer holidays were in the dear old Rectory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what a lucky girl I was to get such a teacher and  such a dear friend for nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call bed and board, lavender-scented linen, cream  &agrave; discr&eacute;tion, pony-cart, lawn tennis, luncheon parties, dinner at the Squire&rsquo;s,  a dance at the market town &mdash; do you call that nothing? Well, the bargain suited  us both, I think, and it was a pleasure to train one of the finest mezzosopranos  I know. And now, Gracie,&rdquo; slowly, hesitatingly even,&rdquo; what about your winter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five months of books, music, and idleness. My lotus  land was never lovelier, But for a January storm, that tore my roses and spoilt  a Bougainvilliers that covers half the house, I should hardly have known it was  winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And were you quite alone all the time? No visitors?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a mortal! You know I go to my villa to read and  think. When I am tired of my own thoughts and other people&rsquo;s &mdash; one does tire occasionally  even of Browning, even of Shakespeare &mdash; I turn to my piano, and find a higher range  of thought in Beethoven. You know I go the pace all through the London season, never  shirk a dance, do three cotillons a week, go everywhere, see everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know you have gone the pace, since your three  years&rsquo; mourning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After Cowes  comes the reaction, a month or so in Northumberland, just to show myself to my people,  and see that the gardeners are doing their duty; and then when the leaves begin  to fall, away to my olive woods and their perpetual grey. For half the year I revel  in solitude. If you would spend a winter with me I should be charmed, for you like  the life I like, and it would be a solitude <i>&agrave; deux</i>. But the common herd are only  good in cities. I come back to London  to be sociable and amused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rodney rose and put on her mantle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you stop and dine? I&rsquo;ll send you snugly home  in my brougham.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Home was a villa facing Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! dear, it&rsquo;s impossible! I am due in Cadogan Square at half-past  six &mdash; Islington and Chelsea &rsquo;bus from Regent-circus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lesson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two lessons &mdash; sisters, and not an iota of voice between  them. But I shall make them sing. Give me a scrap of intelligence, and I can always  manage that. Good-bye, Grace. Ask me to dinner some other night, when you are alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to-morrow night, or the night after. I have no  engagement, as you know. Let us see a lot of each other before the rush begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friday night, then. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They kissed again. Lady Perivale rang the bell, and  then followed her friend towards the drawing-room door; but on her way there Miss  Rodney stopped suddenly, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue, Sue, what is it? I knew you had something on your  mind. If it&rsquo;s a money trouble, dear, make light of it, for it needn&rsquo;t plague you  another minute. I have more money than I know what to do with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no, dear; it&rsquo;s not money,&rdquo; sobbed Sue. &ldquo;Oh,  what a fool I am &mdash; what a weakminded, foolish fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footman opened the door, and looked with vacant countenance  at the agitated group. Early initiation in his superiors&rsquo; domestic troubles had  taught him to compose his features when storms were raging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door, James &mdash; presently,&rdquo; his mistress said, confusedly,  watching him leave the room with that incredible slowness with which such persons  appear to move when we want to get rid of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very foolish, if you won&rsquo;t trust your old friend Gracie!&rdquo;  she said, making Sue sit down, and seating herself beside her, and then in caressing  tones, &ldquo;Now, dear, tell me all your troubles. You know there is no sorrow of yours  &mdash; no difficulty &mdash; no complication &mdash; which would find me unsympathetic. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gracie, Gracie, my darling girl, it&rsquo;s not my trouble.  It&rsquo;s yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine?&rdquo; with intense surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear. I meant to have kept silence. I thought  it was the only course, in such a delicate matter. I meant to leave things alone  &mdash; and let you find out for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find out! What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scandal, Grace &mdash; a scandal that touches you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scandal can touch me? Scandal! Why, I have never  done anything in my life that the most malignant gossip in London could turn to my disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her indignant eyes, her full, strong voice, answered  for her truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Grace, I knew, I knew there couldn&rsquo;t be anything  in it. A wicked lie, a cowardly attack upon a pure-minded woman &mdash; a woman of spotless  character; the last woman upon this earth to give ground for such a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Sue, if you love me, be coherent! What is the story?  Who is the slanderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows how it began! My Duchess told me. I spoke  of you the other day at our <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> luncheon. I told her about your lovely voice,  your passion for music. She nodded her old wig in a supercilious way. &lsquo;I have heard  her sing,&rsquo; she said curtly. She waited till the servants left the room, and then  asked me if it was possible I had not heard the scandal about Lady Perivale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What scandal? Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake come to that, Sue.  Never mind your Duchess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell you in the most brutal way. It seems  that three or four people, whose names I haven&rsquo;t discovered, declare they met you  in Algiers, and in Corsica and Sardinia, travelling with Colonel Rannock &mdash; travelling  with Colonel Rannock &mdash; passing as his wife, under a <i>nom de guerre</i> &mdash; Mr. and Mrs.  Randall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How utterly disgusting and absurd! But what on earth  can have made them imagine such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People say you were seen &mdash; seen and recognized &mdash; by  different people who knew you, in one or the other of those places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelling with Colonel Rannock, as his wife! My God!  A man I refused three times. Three times,&rdquo; laughing hysterically. &ldquo;Why, I have had  him on his knees in this room; kneeling, Sue, like a lover in an old comedy; and  I only laughed at him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rather a dangerous thing to do, Grace, with  some men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Colonel Rannock is not the kind of man to start  a vendetta for a woman&rsquo;s laughter. He is a laughing philosopher himself, and takes  everything lightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he? One never knows what there is behind that  lightness. What if Colonel Rannock has set this scandal on foot with a view to proposing  a fourth time, and getting himself accepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could he make people swear they saw me &mdash; me! &mdash;  at Algiers, when I was in Italy? It is all nonsense Sue; an absurd  <i>malentendu;</i> my name substituted for some other woman&rsquo;s. Now I am in London, the matter will be  put straight in an hour. People have only to see me again to be sure I am not that  kind of woman. As for Colonel Rannock, he may be dissipated, and a spendthrift;  but he is well-born, and he ought to be a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who said he was ill-born? Surely, you know that there  are good races and bad. Who can tell when the bad blood came in, and the character  of the race began to degenerate? Under the Plantagenets, perhaps. Colonel Rannock  comes of a bad race &mdash; everybody knows that. His grandfather, Lord Kirkmichael, was  notorious in the Regency. He left his memories, don&rsquo;t you know, to be published  fifty years after his death &mdash; an awful book &mdash; that had a <i>succ&egrave;s de scandale</i> six  or seven years ago. He was bosom friend of Lord Hertford, and that set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not trouble myself about his grandfather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but you ought! A man&rsquo;s family history is the man.  Lord Kirkmichael&rsquo;s grandson would be capable of anything infamous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is too preposterous for consideration,&rdquo;  Lady Perivale said angrily. &ldquo;I wonder at your taking it tragically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, recalling that empty salver instead of the  usual pile of letters and cards, she cried, distractedly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is shameful &mdash; atrocious &mdash; that any one upon earth  could believe such a thing of me. It makes me hate the human race. Yes, and I shall  always hate those horrid wretches I called friends, however they may try to make  amends for this insolent neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no question of taking the matter lightly now,  for Grace Perivale burst into a passion of sobs, and was quite as tragic as her  friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Grace, pray, pray be calm! Don&rsquo;t stay in  this odious London,  where people have no hearts. Why not go to your Northern castle, and live there  quietly till the mystery clears itself, as no doubt it will soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go?&rdquo; cried Lady Perivale, starting up out of the drooping  attitude in which she had given way to her distress. &ldquo;Beat a retreat? Why, if Grosvenor Square were  a fiery furnace I would stay and face those wretches &mdash; those false, false friends  &mdash; till I made them know the kind of woman I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, perhaps that is best &mdash; if you can stand  it,&rdquo; Susan answered, rather sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is Colonel Rannock? Surely he has not been  dumb! It is his business to bring the slanderers to book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I told the Duchess. But Rannock has not  been seen in London since the autumn, and is said  to be shooting something in the Rockies. And now,  I must rush off to my lessons. Good-bye, again, dear. Don&rsquo;t forget that I am to  dine with you on Friday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I invite a party of twenty to meet you &mdash; an impromptu  party, asked by telegraph, such as I had last year to welcome me home?&rdquo; Grace asked,  bitterly. &ldquo;Go, dear! Don&rsquo;t be too sorry for me. I shall weather the storm. I ought  to be more amused than distressed by such nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rodney dried her tearful eyes, and composed her  agitated features, on her way downstairs. The footman stood ready to open the door,  stifling a yawn behind his hand. Miss Rodney gave a quick glance round the hall,  taking in all its spaciousness and splendour, the marble group at the foot of the  double staircase, the bronze and ormula candelabra, the crimson carpets, softer  than forest moss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rich beyond the dreams of avarice &mdash; and so unhappy!&rdquo;  she thought, as she hurried off to catch the Chelsea &rsquo;bus.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;How blest he names, in love&rsquo;s familiar tone,<br>
  The kind fair friend by nature marked his own;<br>
  And, in the waveless mirror of his mind,<br>
  Views the fleet years of pleasure left behind,<br>
  Since when her empire o&rsquo;er his heart began &mdash; <br>
Since first he called her his before the holy man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not often in the London season that Lady Perivale  could taste the pleasures of solitude, a long evening by her own fireside, unbroken  by letters, messages, telegrams, sudden inroads of friends breaking in upon her  at eleven o&rsquo;clock, between a dinner and a dance, wanting to know why she had not  been at the dinner, and whether she was going to the dance, or dances, of the evening,  what accident or caprice had eclipsed their star. But on this night of her return  the visitor&rsquo;s bell sounded no more after Susan Rodney left her. The quiet of her  house was so strange a thing that it almost scared her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand what a leper must feel in his  cavern in the wilderness,&rdquo; she said to herself with a laugh. &ldquo;The thing is almost  tragic, and yet so utterly absurd. It is tragic to discover what society friendships  are made of &mdash; ropes of sand that fly away with the first wind that blows unkindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pretended to dine, for the servants might have heard  of the scandal, and she did not want them to think her crushed by unmerited slights.  They, of course, knew the truth, since she had two witnesses among them to prove  an <i>alibi</i>, Johnson the butler, and her devoted maid, Emily Scott.</p>
<p>She did not know that the first footman and the cook  had both laughed off Johnson&rsquo;s indignant statement that his mistress had never left  Porto Maurizio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not the man to give her away if she had gone  off for a bit of a scamper. You and Miss Scott would look the other way when her  boxes were being labelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;d take a courier maid instead of Emily,&rdquo; said  the cook. &ldquo;After all, it&rsquo;s only <i>finn der seecle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t she marry him, and ha&rsquo; done with it?&rdquo; said  the footman.</p>
<p>Butler and maid were goaded into a  fury by talk of this kind, and it was only the force of <i>esprit de corps</i>, and the  fact that James was six foot one, and a first rate plate-cleaner, that prevented  Mr. Johnson sacking him on the instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever know me tell a lie?&rdquo; he asked indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or me?&rdquo; sobbed Emily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your own account,&rdquo; said the cook; &ldquo;but you&rsquo;d  tell a good big one to screen your mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I might perhaps,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;if she wanted  screening; but she don&rsquo;t, and, what&rsquo;s more, she never will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all I can say is it&rsquo;s all over London,&rdquo; said  James, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s made it very unpleasant for me at the Feathers, for, of course,  I stand up for my lady in public, and swear it&rsquo;s a pack of lies. But here we&rsquo;re  tiled in, and I&rsquo;m free to confess I don&rsquo;t believe in smoke without fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went on wrangling till bedtime, while Grace sat  by the fire in the little drawing-room with her brown poodle lying on the lace flounces  of her tea-gown, and tried to read.</p>
<p>She tried book after book, Meredith, Hardy, Browning,  Anatole France, taking the volumes at random from a whirligig book-stand, twisting  the stand about impatiently to find a book that would calm her agitation, and beguile  her thoughts into a new channel. But literature was no use to her to-night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it is only happy people who can read,&rdquo; she thought.  She opened no more books, and let her mind work as it would. There had been sorrows  in her life, deep and lasting sorrow, in the early death of a husband to whom she  had been fondly attached, and in the previous loss of a father she had adored. But  in spite of these losses, which had darkened her sky for a long time, her life had  been happy; she had a happy disposition, the capacity for enjoyment, the love of  all that was bright and beautiful in the world, art, music, flowers, scenery, horses,  dogs &mdash; and even people. She loved travelling, she loved the gaiety of a London season, she loved the  quiet of her Italian villa. Her childhood had been spent in a rustic solitude, and  all her girlish pleasures had been of the simplest. The only child of a father who  had done with the world when he read the burial service over his young wife, and  who had lived in almost unbroken retirement in an East Anglian Rectory. He was a  student, and could afford a curate to take the burden of parish work, in a sparsely  populated parish, where distance, not numbers, had to be considered. He kept good  horses, mounted his curate, and drove or rode about among his flock, and was beloved  even by the roughest of them.</p>
<p>That girl-child was the one human thing he had to love,  and he lavished love upon her. He taught her, trained her to appreciate all that  is best in literature, yet kept her simple as a child, and thought of her as if  she were still a child after her eighteenth birthday, and so was taken by surprise  when Sir Hector Perivale, who had met her at friendly parties in the neighbourhood,  came to him at the end of the shooting season, and asked to be accepted as her future  husband.</p>
<p>He had offered himself to Grace, and Grace had not said  no. Grace had allowed him to call upon the rector.</p>
<p>Mr. Mallandine looked up from his book like a man in  a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry my Grace!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, she has hardly done  with her dolls. It seems only yesterday she was sitting on the carpet over there&rdquo;  &mdash; pointing to a corner of his library&mdash;&ldquo;playing with her doll&rsquo;s-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, rector, she is a woman, and a very clever woman.  She gave me excellent advice the other day when we were threatened with a strike  in the north. She has a better head for business than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be,&rdquo; said Mr. Mallandine, smiling at him.  &ldquo;But she is not old enough to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will be nineteen on her next birthday, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pertinacious young man you are. Her next birthday  is nearly a year off. She shall not take the cares of a husband and a household  until she is twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means two years, rector. What am I to do with  myself all that time?&rdquo; Sir Hector asked ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as other young men do. Isn&rsquo;t there sport enough  and travel enough for such as you? Go to Canada, to the North Pole, to the Pamirs,  over the roof of the world. I thought no young man of spirit was satisfied till  he had crossed the Pamirs, or shot lions in Bechuanaland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have left off caring for such things since I have  known Grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to possess your soul in patience.  My daughter&rsquo;s girlhood belongs to me. Two years hence she will be a woman, and able  to know whether she loves you well enough to live and die with you, or whether she  only wants to be called my lady. It will be hard enough for me to part with her  then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not part with her, rector. You will have  a son as well as a daughter. That will be the only difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All prospective sons-in-law say the same thing. Come,  Sir Hector, I don&rsquo;t want to be selfish. Grace has been the sunshine of my life ever  since she and I were left alone in the world together. I want to see her happily,  married before I lay me down for the long sweet sleep; but I will not have her marry  till she has had time to fall in love and out of love a good many times with the  man who is to have the charge of her destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no choice but to submit, since Grace thought  as her father thought, so Sir Hector reconciled himself to a two years&rsquo; engagement,  but could but smile as he thought how brief need have been his probation had his  choice fallen in the Mayfair marriage market.</p>
<p>Fate was on his side, after all. For a little more than  half a year Grace and he were betrothed lovers, meeting under restrictions; and  the rector had leisure to study his future son-in-law&rsquo;s character.</p>
<p>He found no evil in Hector Perivale, and he found much  good &mdash; a warm heart, an honest, open disposition, pluck such as should go with good  blood. It was quite true that Grace was the cleverer of the two, and could even  give good advice in the difficulties between capital and labour, always in favour  of concessions, yet always counselling a firm attitude when labour put on the aspect  of an enemy, and refused to hear reason.</p>
<p>Then, one day, when it was least expected of him, the  rector held out his hand to Sir Hector over their evening wine, and said &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are a good fellow, Hector, and that you  will make my Grace happy. Marry her as soon as you and she like &mdash; the sooner the  better for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, this is indeed generous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it is only prudent. I told you I wanted to see  my daughter happily married before I die. Well, when I was in London the other day I saw a specialist &mdash; at the  advice of Ringston, here &mdash; and he told me my life is not quite so good as I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, I hope he was wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do I, Hector. But I shall act as if I was sure he  was right. There is nothing certain about his verdict &mdash; a man and a mortal disease  may jog on for years together &mdash; so not a word to alarm Grace. I would not have the  bright morning of her life clouded by fears about me. You can tell her that I admire  your character so much that I want to secure you at once as my son-in-law. I shall  only tell her to set about her trousseau.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace required a great deal of talking to, on her father&rsquo;s  part and on Hector&rsquo;s, before she was reconciled to a speedy marriage. She was sure  her father wanted her. He had not been looking well lately. He had left off those  early morning rides which had been so delightful, and which she had often shared  with him &mdash; those long scampers on the broad margins of greensward on the edge of  the pine-woods, in the freshness of the new day. He let his groom drive for him,  even his favourite cob, whose mouth no hand but his own had been allowed to control  till lately.</p>
<p>Her father laughed off her fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you think I was never going to be an old man, Gracie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, father! Oh, not yet for a score of years.  Why, it was only last summer everybody was telling me how young you looked &mdash; growing  younger instead of older.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was last summer, Gracie. <i>O&ugrave; sont les neiges d&rsquo;antan?</i>  Don&rsquo;t you know that when Time has seemed to stand still for ever so long, he seems  to move on very fast all of a sudden? It is all only seeming. The sands are always  falling, and the scythe is always moving &mdash; slow and sure, my love, slow and very  sure. But I shall be a happy old man when I see my darling married to the man of  her choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you call yourself an old man, I won&rsquo;t marry him,&rdquo;  Grace said almost angrily. &ldquo;If you are an old man, you want a spinster daughter  to take care of you &mdash; and in that case I shall never marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at her with a touch of mournfulness. She would  not have long to wait, perhaps, if she insisted on staying to the end.</p>
<p>After this he was careful to talk in a cheerful strain,  and played his part so well that she left him for an Italian honeymoon without the  faintest apprehension of evil &mdash; left him a gay and happy bride, going out into a  beautiful world of which she knew nothing but East Anglia.</p>
<p>The whole of May was spent on the lakes &mdash; first Maggiore,  and then Como, They stayed at Baveno, lived most of their life on the lake, and  visited the three islands till they knew them by heart &mdash; the gardens, the palaces,  the fishermen&rsquo;s huts, the <i>caf&eacute;s</i>, the people, old and young, crones, children, boatmen,  priests. Those island gardens in their glory of Maytime made a region of enchantment  that even Grace&rsquo;s dreams over Rogers&rsquo;s Italy had never  equalled. The facilities of travel, repetition, the crowding of tourists, may have  cheapened these exquisite scenes; but to each of us on that first Italian journey  they offer the same magic philter, the same revelation of a loveliness beyond our  power of dreaming.</p>
<p>Then came Bellagio, Cadenabbia, Varenna, a leisurely  tour of that still lovelier lake; and then, when June began and the days waxed hot,  a quiet week at Promontogno, roaming in chestnut woods, driving up the hill to Soglio.  Then to the cool breezes of the Engadine.</p>
<p>It was at Pontresina that a telegram came &mdash; one of those  fatal messages that are opened so lightly, expectant of some trivial intelligence,  and which bring despair &mdash;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The Rector dangerously ill. Pray come home immediately  &mdash;<br>
MARY.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary was Mr. Mallandine&rsquo;s cook and house-keeper, an  admirable person, not without considerable dignity, and a black silk gown for Sundays;  but who had risen from the ranks, and was still only &ldquo;Mary,&rdquo; as she had been when  she was a kitchen-maid at seven pounds a year.</p>
<p>That hurried journey through the long June days was  a never-to-be-forgotten experience. Sir Hector planned everything, so that not a  minute should be lost. They left Pontresina at two in the morning in a carriage  and four, and halted only to change horses; reached Coire in time for the express,  and halted no more till they were at Victoria.  Then across London  to Liverpool Street,  and then to the grey quiet of the Suffolk-Rectory, in the second evening of their  journey.</p>
<p>Grace was not too late. Her father lingered for nearly  a month after her return, and all the consolation that last hours and fond words,  mutual prayers, tears, and kisses, can give in the after time, were given to her.  She never forgot those solemn hours, that sweet communion and confession of faith,  her education for eternity. Never, perhaps, until those sad hours had she known  how true a Christian her father was, or realized the perfect beauty of the Christian  life and the Christian death.</p>
<p>She had further evidence of his goodness in the grief  of his parishioners, to whom his bounty had been limited only by his means, life  at the Rectory being planned with a Spartan simplicity, so as to leave the wider  margin for the poor.</p>
<p>When all was over Sir Hector took his wife back to Switzerland;  but not to the scenes where those evil tidings had found her. He was all the world  to her now, and his heart was a fountain of tenderness. The bond between husband  and wife was strengthened by Grace&rsquo;s sorrow. They lived alone in the loveliest places  of the earth for more than a year, and then it was for Hector&rsquo;s sake that Grace  took up the burden of life, and began her new duties as mistress of the house in  Grosvenor Square,  and the Castle in Northumberland. The town house had been refurnished while they  were on their travels. All the ponderous early Victorian rosewood and mahogany had  been swept into the limbo of things that were once thought beautiful. The chairs  with curved backs and Brussels sprouts upon their gouty legs, the acres of looking  glass framed in cabbage leaves, the loo-tables, and heavy valances shutting out the  top-light of every window, all the draperies making for darkness, disappeared under  the ruthless hand of improvement; and from the dust and shadow of a lumber-room  filled by past generations, mirrors crowned with golden eagles, chairs with shield-shaped  backs and wheatsheaf carving, were brought out into the light of day, and were deemed  worthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether anybody will ever want the loo-tables  and Victorian sideboards back again?&rdquo; Grace said; but the upholsterer had provided  against that contingency by carrying everything away, to be sold for firewood, he  told Sir Hector, and a very small item on the credit side of his account was supposed  to represent their value in that capacity.</p>
<p>Then began Grace Perivale&rsquo;s new phase of existence &mdash;  a life of luxury that was as much a revelation as the loveliness of lakes and mountains,  the blue of an Italian sky. She was only twenty, and she found herself almost a  personage, one of the recognized beauties, who could not move without a paragraph.  Her appearance on a tiara night at the opera, her diamonds, her frocks, her parties,  her poodles were written about. All the lady journalists followed her movements  with unflagging pens. She could not take up a newspaper, at least among those of  the frivolous order, without seeing her name in it.</p>
<p>She laughed, was inclined to be disgusted, and made  mock of the papers, but was not actually displeased. Even in East Anglia, after  a round of tennis-parties in the gardens of neighbouring squarsons, in a district  where almost everybody was a parson, and most of the parsons were landowners and  rich &mdash; even in those rural scenes she had discovered that people admired her; and  then Sir Hector had come with his adulation, taking fire at her beauty as at a flame,  and declaring that she was the loveliest girl in England. And at twenty to be called  &mdash; even by irresponsible young women &mdash; a queen of Society, has its intoxication.</p>
<p>She plunged into the world of pleasure. Her husband  was a member of all the pleasure clubs &mdash; Hurlingham, Sandown, and the rest. Had  there been a hundred he would have belonged to them all. He was popular, and had  scores of friends, and if Grace had been much less attractive, she would have been  well received for Sir Hector&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>She caught the knack of entertaining, and her parties  were pronounced right from the outset. She was open to advice from old hands, but  had ideas of her own, and thought out the subject thoroughly. She imparted a touch  of originality to the commonest things. Her dinner table surprised with some flower  that nobody else had thought of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to see ferns and green frogs at your next  dinner,&rdquo; said Mr. George Howard, famous in literature and politics, ultra Liberal  scion of a Liberal house, and a great admirer of Lady Perivale&rsquo;s. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think  you can find anything new &mdash; short of frogs. They must have tiny gold chains to fasten  them to the <i>&eacute;pergne</i>, like the turtle that swim about under the jetty at Nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was by the pleasantness and number of her parties  that Grace established herself as an entertainer, rather than by their splendour.  Who can be splendid in an age of African millionaires, of Americans with inexhaustible  oil-springs? She did not vie with the oil and diamond people. She left them their  proper element &mdash; the colossal. Her <i>m&eacute;tier</i> was to give small parties, and to bring  nice people together. She studied every invitation as carefully as a move at chess.  Her queen, her knights, her bishops &mdash; she knew exactly how to place them. The knights  &mdash; those choicest pieces that move anyway &mdash; were her wits and brilliant talkers,  the men whom everybody wants to meet, and who always say the right thing. Her queens  were of every type; first the beauties, then the clever women, then the great ladies,  dowagers or otherwise, the women whose social status is in itself an attraction.</p>
<p>She smiled when people praised her tact and <i>savoir faire</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so little to think about,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;no child,  no near relations. And Hector spoils me. He encourages me to care for trivial things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he cares for them himself &mdash; if you call the  pleasantness of life trivial. I don&rsquo;t. I call it the one thing worth thinking about.  I could name a score of women in London  who have all the essentials of happiness and yet their houses are intolerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus Mr. Howard, her self-appointed mentor. He went  about praising her. Everybody wondered that a girl of twenty, who had been reared  in a rural parsonage, could commit so few gaucheries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few!&rdquo; cried Howard, indignantly. &ldquo;She has never been  gauche. She is incapable of the kind of blunder Frenchmen call <i>gaffe</i>. Some women  are born with a feeling for society, as others are born with a feeling for art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Northumberland, as in London, Lady Perivale&rsquo;s success was unquestionable.  Sir Hector&rsquo;s old chums &mdash; the shooting and hunting and fishing men &mdash; were delighted  with his choice and Sir Hector himself was in a seventh heaven of wedded bliss.  One only blessing was denied him. Grace and her husband longed for a child on whom  to lavish the overplus of love in two affectionate natures. But no child had come  to them.</p>
<p>A child might have brought consolation in that dark  season when, after three days and nights of acute anxiety, Grace Perivale found  herself a widow, and more lonely in her wealth and station than women often are  in that sad hour of bereavement.</p>
<p>Her father had been the last of an old Norfolk family in which only  children were hereditary. She had neither uncles nor aunts. She had heard of remote  cousinships, but her father had held but scantiest communion with those distant  kindred, most of whom were distant in locality as well as in blood.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I see him furnished forth for his career,<br>
  On starting from the life-chance in our world,<br>
  With nearly all we count sufficient help:<br>
  Body and mind in balance, a sound frame,<br>
  A solid intellect: the wit to seek,<br>
  Wisdom to choose, and courage wherewithal<br>
  To deal with whatsoever circumstance<br>
  Should minister to man, make life succeed.<br>
Oh, and much drawback! What were such without?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now began the third phase of Lady Perivale&rsquo;s existence.  She spent the next three years, not in utter loneliness, but in complete retirement  from worldly pleasures. It was in this time of bereavement that her devoted Sue  was of most use to her. She persuaded Sue to travel with her during her first year  of widowhood, at the risk of losing that to which Miss Rodney had been a slave &mdash;  her connection. Grace insisted on her friend accepting a salary to cover that jeopardized  connection; and, when they went back to London,  it was Grace&rsquo;s care to find new pupils to fill the gaps. When West Kensington or  Balham had fallen away, Lady Perivale sent recruits from Mayfair and Belgravia. She had a host of girl-friends &mdash; her court, her  &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Maries&rdquo; &mdash; and she could order them to have lessons from her dearest Sue.  In some cases she went further than this, and paid for the lessons &mdash; girl-friends  being often impecunious &mdash; but this her friend never knew. But she may have been  near guessing the truth later, for, after that one Italian winter, Miss Rodney would  travel no more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one of the working bees, Grace,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and  you are trying to make a drone of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear, that could never be; but I want you to have  your butterfly season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was while she was with her friend that they came  upon the villa above Porto Maurizio. Grace fell in love with the spot because, although  near the high-road to Genoa,  it lay off the beaten track, and was purely Italian &mdash; no Swiss-German hotel, no  English tourists. The villa was out of repair, and by no means beautiful; but some  extent of land went with it &mdash; olive woods, lemon groves, old, old mulberry trees,  festooned with vines that were looped from tree to tree, banks of carnations, a  wilderness of roses.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale sent for the owner&rsquo;s agent, and bought  land and villa as easily as she would have bought a bonnet. The agent saw her childlike  eagerness for a new toy, and only asked twice as much as the reserve price.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a place that can be made anything in the hands  of an owner of taste and means,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and if you find the land a burden you  can always let it on the <i>m&eacute;tairie</i> system.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I mean to keep the land, and employ people &mdash; to  have my own olive woods, my own oranges and lemons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled, remembering a nursery game of her childhood.  Oranges and lemons!  Never had she thought to see them growing on sunlit heights, sloping upward from  a sapphire sea, to that dark line where the olives cease and the pines begin, darker  and darker, till they touch the rugged edge of far-off snow-peaks.</p>
<p>It was three years before Lady Perivale went back to  the world in which everybody&rsquo;s business &mdash; barring the few who live for politics  or philanthropy &mdash; is to cram the utmost amusement into the shortest space of time.  The briefer the season the faster the pace. Three balls a night. Mrs. A.&rsquo;s concert  jostling with Mrs. B.&rsquo;s private theatricals, and both of them crushed under the  Juggernaut car of her Grace&rsquo;s fancy ball. The longer the invitation the worse chance  of a dull party: for those duchesses and marchionesses can spring a great entertainment  on the town at a fortnight&rsquo;s notice, and empty meaner people&rsquo;s dancing-rooms, and  leave the Coldstreams or the Hungarians fiddling to twenty couples in a house where  there is breathing space everywhere.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale felt as if she were awaking from a long  dream of beautiful places and tranquil hours, awaking in the din and riot of a crowded  fair. But she opened her own little booth with a proper dignity. She was almost  glad to see old faces, and to be made a prodigious fuss about.</p>
<p>She was the rage in that season of her return. There  was hardly a bachelor in town who did not want to marry her, though many were too  wise to pursue the charming prey. Her girl-friends who had married, and her girl-friends  who were still single, flocked round her, and her house was the rendezvous of all  the pretty people in London.  Her dinners, her luncheons, her little musical afternoons &mdash; a single artist, perhaps,  or at most two, and a room only half full &mdash; but, most of all, her suppers after  the play or the opera were the top of the mode.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She spends her money on the things that are best worth  having,&rdquo; Mr. Howard said of her, &ldquo;and that alone is genius. She breakfasts on an  egg, and dines on a cutlet, but she has taken the trouble to secure an incomparable  cook, and she gives him <i>carte blanche</i>. She drinks nothing stronger than salutaris,  but she lets me order her wine, and gives me a free hand, as she does Herr Ganz  when he organizes her concerts. Such a woman knows how to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in this year of her return to the world of pleasure,  when all things seemed more dazzling by contrast, that she made the acquaintance  of two men whom she had not known during her married life. One was Arthur Haldane,  a man of letters, who had leapt at once into renown by the success of a first novel  &mdash; a work of fire and flame, which had startled the novel-reading world, and surprised  even the critics, in an age when all stories have been told, and when genius means  an original mind dealing with old familiar things. Since that success Mr. Haldane  had devoted himself to more solid and serious works, and he was now a personage  in the literary world. The other was Colonel Rannock, a Scotchman of old family,  grandson of the Earl of Kirkmichael, and late of the Lanarkshire regiment, the man  who was destined to bring trouble into Grace Perivale&rsquo;s smooth and prosperous life.  He was a reprobate, a man who had long been banished from the holy of holies in  the temple of society, but who contrived to whirl in the vortex, nevertheless, by  the indulgence of old friends and allies of his house, who would not cast him off  utterly so long as he was only suspected and had never been found out. He was known  to have ruined other men, callow subalterns who had admired and trusted him; he  was known to have lived in the company of vicious women, to have said to evil, &ldquo;Be  thou my good&rdquo;; and he was even suspected of having cheated at Captain Rook who keeps  company with pigeons.</p>
<p>But against all this there was the man&rsquo;s personal charm  &mdash; that subtle, indescribable charm of a high-bred Scotchman who has lived in the  best Continental society, and is also a cosmopolitan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charm that no woman could resist.&rdquo; That was what  men who knew him well said of him.</p>
<p>It was this man that in an evil hour Grace Perivale  admitted to her friendship. She had not known him a week before she had been lectured  about him, assured solemnly that he ought not to cross her threshold. Her friendly mentor  Mr. Howard, was the most importunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am old enough to be your father, Lady Perivale,&rdquo;  he began; but she stopped him with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you say that I know something horrid is coming;  though my dear father never said a disagreeable thing to me in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you were safe then &mdash; a little boat chained  to a pier &mdash; and now you are a fast sailing schooner racing through unknown waters.  I know the chart, and where there are shoals. You must not let Colonel Rannock visit  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he, too, is old enough to be my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am ten years older than he, and thirty years  more trustworthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about the trustworthiness of a casual  acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rannock will not remain your casual acquaintance. He  will make himself your friend, whether you like it or not, unless you put him in  his place at once, or, in plain words, tell your butler you are never to be at home  to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to shut my door against the most amusing  man I have met for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is how he begins. He amuses. It is the thin  end of the wedge. Then he interests &mdash; then &mdash; and then &mdash; But I need not pursue the  subject. He will never reach those later stages. You will find him out before then.  But in the mean time he &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you stop short like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard had been nearly saying, &ldquo;He will compromise you,&rdquo;  but would not for worlds have made an insulting suggestion to a woman he so thoroughly  believed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, my dear Mr. Howard, you must credit me with some  knowledge of human nature, and believe that if I find Colonel Rannock unworthy of  my acquaintances, I shall know how to dismiss him. I want to be amused. I have had  two great sorrows in my life &mdash; the loss of a father I adored, and of the best of  husbands. Perhaps you don&rsquo;t know how sad life is when one is always looking back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I not? I, who have lived nearly half a century!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, no doubt you too have your griefs. But you are  a sportsman and an explorer, a politician and a philanthropist. You have so many  ways of forgetting. I have only a woman&rsquo;s distractions, dawdling about the Continent,  or steeping myself in London  gaieties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Howard did not pursue the argument, and he never  recurred to it. He was too proud a man to hazard a second repulse. If she made so  light of his counsel she should be troubled with no more of it. He admired and esteemed  her, and there may have been some touch of deeper feeling, which, at his sober age,  he would scarcely confess to himself, though Lafontaine&rsquo;s sad question often found  an echo in his breast&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Ai-je pass&eacute; le temps d&rsquo;aimer?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale lived in a crowd all that season, but  Colonel Rannock was a prominent figure in the crowd, and people were kinder to him  than they had been, on her account. It was thought that she would marry him, and  he would shine forth rehabilitated, rich, and a power in society; and the clever,  pushing, second-rate people who had cut him last season began to think they had  been precipitate and ill-advised. The end of the season came in a moment, as it  seemed, after Goodwood. Everybody was going or gone, and the Park was a Sahara sprinkled with nursemaids and perambulators. Lady Perivale  made up her house-party for her Border   Castle, but Colonel Rannock  was not of the party. She let him haunt her footsteps in London, but she would not admit him to the intimacy  of a houseguest. So much evil had George Howard&rsquo;s warning done him. He tried hard  for an invitation, and was irritated at failing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have no music in your villeggiatura, and what  a dull set you have chosen. Your women are nice enough, young and bright, and pretty,  and only wanting to be amused; but your men are hopeless. Frank Lawford &mdash; a quarterly  review in breeches, Canon Millighan &mdash; a Jesuit in disguise, and Captain Grant, Sir  Henry Bolton, Jack Scudamore, who live only to fill gamebags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were my husband&rsquo;s friends, and I am very glad  for them to shoot his birds, Poor Hector! I always think of the birds and the moor  as his still &mdash; the cruel moor that cost him his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes clouded as she spoke of her husband. Commonplace  and kindly, a homely figure in the drama of life, he had been her first and only  lover, her faithful and devoted husband, and, after three years of mourning, regret  was not lessened. Colonel Rannock talked again of her house-party. He was going  to Iceland  to shoot things, and to live under canvas in unconceivable roughness and discomfort.  He spoke with bitterness of a joyless holiday, and then, as if on the impulse of  the moment, confessed his passion, his jealous rage at the thought of her surrounded  by other men, and asked her to be his wife.</p>
<p>This was his first throw of the dice. She rejected  him with a kindly firmness which she thought would settle the question for ever.  He promised that it should be so. He would be content to know himself her friend,  and so he went off to Iceland  without further murmuring.</p>
<p>History repeated itself next season, when people were  beginning to wonder why she did not marry him &mdash; nay, even to say that she ought  to marry him. Mr. Howard was in China,  on a diplomatic mission, so there was no prophet in Israel to warn her of coming evil. In  this year Colonel Rannock offered himself to her twice, and was twice refused; but  even after the third disappointment, he declared himself still her friend, and the  <i>concertante</i> duets, and the dinners and suppers, at which he was her most brilliant  talker, went on. And people said, &ldquo;Dear Lady Perivale is so very unconventional.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:<br>
  Drink deep, until the habits of the slave,<br>
  The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite<br>
  And slander, die. Better not be at all<br>
Than not be noble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susan Rodney and her friend dined <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> in a solemn  splendour of butler and silk-stockinged footmen, and talked of music and the Opera.  They spent the evening in Lady Perivale&rsquo;s sitting-room on the second floor, a delightful  room, with three windows on a level with the tree tops in the square, and containing  all her favourite books, her favourite etchings, her favourite piano, and her <i>marron</i>  poodle&rsquo;s favourite easy-chair. The poodle was the choicest thing in ornamental dogs,  beautiful exceedingly, with silken hair of the delicatest brown, and a face like  a Lord Chief Justice, beautiful, but cold hearted, accepting love, but hardly reciprocating,  thinking nothing the world holds too good for him. Susan Rodney called him marron  <i>glac&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale glanced at the drawing-rooms, and turned  away with a faint shiver. Their spacious emptiness glittered with a pale brilliancy  in the electric light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall be cosier in my den, Sue,&rdquo; she said; and they  went upstairs together, and seated themselves in low, luxurious chairs, by tables  loaded with roses and lilies of the valley.</p>
<p>A wood fire flamed and crackled on the amber-tiled hearth,  and the varied colouring of exquisitely bound books, the brightness of rosebud chintz,  and satin pillows heaped on low sofas, gave an air of life and cheerfulness which  was wanting in the sumptuous spaciousness below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what has happened to your photographs?&rdquo; cried  Sue, looking round the room, where one attractive feature had been a collection  of panel, promenade, and other portraits of handsome and fashionable women, in court  gowns, in ball gowns, in tea gowns, in riding habits, in fancy dress, nay, even  in bathing dress, at Trouville or Dieppe, each in the costume the sitter thought  most becoming &mdash; photographs framed in silver, in gold, in tortoiseshell, in ivory,  in brocade, in Dresden china, in every kind of frame that ingenious manufacturers  devise for people with expensive tastes. They had filled a long shelf at the top  of the dado. They had been stuck up in every available corner, when Sue was last  in the room; and, behold, there was not one of them left!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I put the horrid things away,&rdquo; Grace said impatiently;  &ldquo;I wonder I didn&rsquo;t burn them. Who would wish to be surrounded by lying smiles &mdash;  false friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sue said nothing; and even here, within four walls,  the conversation was still about impersonal matters, the books the friends had read  in the last half-year &mdash; a subject which both were fond of discussing &mdash; the authors  they loved, the authors they hated, the successes they wondered at.</p>
<p>After an hour&rsquo;s talk Miss Rodney persuaded her friend  to sing, but Lady Perivale was not in voice. She sang &ldquo;There was a King in Thule&rdquo; with less than her usual  power, and then played desultory bits of Schumann and Schubert, while Sue turned  over a pile of new magazines.</p>
<p>They parted without any allusion to the scandal, except  that angry remark about the photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, dear; it has been so sweet to spend a quiet  evening with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come again very soon, Sue. Come to luncheon or dinner,  whenever you can spare an hour or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The week wore itself out. Lady Perivale received plenty  of letters, but they were almost all of them appeals to her purse &mdash; programmes of  concerts, applications from hospitals, tradesmen&rsquo;s circulars; not a single letter  or card of invitation from anybody of mark.</p>
<p>She was not without visitors on Wednesday afternoon;  but they made a vastly different appearance in her drawing-rooms to her visitors  of last year, and there were no yellow barouches and French victorias waiting in  the square. A gushing widow with two rather tawdry daughters, whom she had met only  at charity bazaars and an occasional <i>omnium gatherum</i>, and had severely kept at a  distance, came sailing and simpering in, followed by two bushy fringes, pert <i>retrouss&eacute;</i>  noses, and suspiciously rosy lips, under picture hats of a cheap smartness, scintillating  with mock diamonds.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Lady Perivale, I know you are at home on Wednesday,  so I thought I would take my courage in my two hands, and call on you, in the hope  of interesting you in the bazaar at the Riding School.  The cause is such a good one &mdash; providing bicycles for daily governesses of small  means. I think you know my girls, Flora and Nora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace was coldly civil. She promised to think about  the bicycles, and she began to pour out tea, which had just been brought in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My girls&rdquo; composed themselves upon low chairs, whisking  the rose-coloured flounces under their pale-green frocks into due prominence, unconscious  of a slightly draggled effect in skirts that had done church parade on three Sundays.  They scanned the spacious drawing-rooms with eyes accustomed to the band-box limitations  of a flat in West Kensington, where, if a sudden  gust blew, one could shut the window with one hand, and the door with the other.</p>
<p>How vast and splendid the rooms were, and yet Lady Perivale  was only a country parson&rsquo;s daughter! They appraised her beauty, and wondered at  her good luck. They took in every detail of her pale lavender frock &mdash; softest silk,  tucked, and frilled, and ruched, and pleated, by a fashionable dressmaker, until,  by sheer needlework, twenty yards of China silk were made to look worth forty guineas.  There was more work in that little visiting-gown than in six of Nora&rsquo;s flocks, although  she spent most of her morning hours at her sewing machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delicious it must be to be so rich,&rdquo; thought Flora.  &ldquo;And what can a trumpery matter to a woman with a house in Grosvenor    Square and powdered footmen? It&rsquo;s ridiculous of mother  to be &lsquo;poor thing-ing&rsquo; her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flora and Nora are helping Lady de Green at the tea-stall,&rdquo;  Mrs. Wilfred explained. &ldquo;They mean to have a quite original tea, don&rsquo;t you know;  Japanese cups and saucers, and tiny brown and white sandwiches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nora has a German friend who can make thirty kinds  of sandwiches,&rdquo; said Flora. &ldquo;I believe sandwich cutting ranks before Wagner&rsquo;s music  as an accomplishment in Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Three young men straggled in while the tea was circulating.  They were men whom Lady Perivale knew very well, but they were not in the best set,  not the men with highly placed mothers and sisters, whose presence gives a cachet.  She thought them a shade too empress&eacute; in their satisfaction at her return to town.  They hoped she was going to give some of her delightful parties, and that she was  not going to waste time before she sent out her cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The season is so short nowadays. Everybody rushes off  to some German cure before July is half over,&rdquo; said Mr. Mordaunt, a clerk at the  Admiralty.</p>
<p>Nobody asked Lady Perivale where she had spent the winter.  She hated them for their reticence, hated them for finding her in the emptiness  of her three drawing-rooms, with only that detestable Mrs. Wilfred, and still more  hateful Flora and Nora. It was so much worse than being quite alone. But she had  sworn to herself to stay in Grosvenor    Square, and could not deny herself to detrimentals.  Nobody stopped long. Mrs. Wilfred did not feel her visit a success, and the men  saw that Lady Perivale was bored.</p>
<p>Captain Marduke, of the Blues, outstayed the others  and put on a certain familiarity of tone. It was the faintest shade of difference,  but Lady Perivale was aware of it, and froze him out in five minutes by her distant  manner.</p>
<p>He met Mordaunt at his club before dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it awful in Grosvenor Square, Tommy?&rdquo; said his friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghastly. Don&rsquo;t you think she was a fool to show herself  in London after  her escapade?&rdquo; returned Marduke, who had been christened Reginald Stuart  Ponsonby, and was Tommy to his friends and the Society papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand it,&rdquo; said Mordaunt, chalking his  cue slowly, and looking at the tip with a puzzled expression, as if the mystery  were there. &ldquo;Such a good woman I always thought her. The very last, don&rsquo;t you know,  to pitch her cap over the mill. And the way she looked at us this afternoon, through  and through, with such proud, steady eyes! It&rsquo;s damn perplexing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, Bill. Your shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But are people sure of the story? Is there no mistake,  do you think? &ldquo;asked Mordaunt, missing an easy cannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! people are sure enough. It isn&rsquo;t one man&rsquo;s word,  you see. Brander met them at Ajaccio, saw her stepping into a carriage in front  of the hotel, met him face to face in the coffee-room, knew by his confused manner  that there was something up, questioned the manager, and found they had been living  there a fortnight as Mr. and Mrs. Randall. Jack Dane saw them in Sardinia. The Willoughby Parkers came upon them in Algiers,  staying at a second-rate hotel in the town, saw them sitting under a palm-tree,  taking their coffee, as they drove by, and met them driving in the environs. No  mistaking her &mdash; as handsome a woman as you&rsquo;d see in a day&rsquo;s journey; no mistaking  him &mdash; a wrong &rsquo;un, but a damn good-looking demon, with the manners of Chesterfield and the morals  of Robert Macaire, the sort of man most women admire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only the wrong sort of women, I think,&rdquo; said Mordaunt,  resuming his cue, the soldier having spaced his sentences with cannons and losers,  and made a break of twenty while he talked. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand such a woman as  Lady Perivale disgracing herself by an intrigue of that kind &mdash; least of all for  such a man as Rannock. Thoroughly bad style!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women don&rsquo;t know bad style from good in our sex; they  only know their own by the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she cared for the man, why not marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much! She is a rich woman, and doesn&rsquo;t want a husband  who would spend every shillin&rsquo; in two or three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! but nowadays a woman can take care of her money.  The law will protect her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from a spendthrift that she&rsquo;s fond of. And nowadays  the clever women have free and easy ideas of the marriage tie. They&rsquo;ve been educated  up to it by novels and newspapers. Well, it isn&rsquo;t a nice story, anyhow you look  at it; but I thought it was friendly to call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did I,&rdquo; said Mordaunt. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid she&rsquo;d rather  not have seen us. I hope she&rsquo;ll go to her place in the north, and cut the whole  boiling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much left for her to cut, poor soul, if people  have given her the cold shoulder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She can cut Mrs. Wilfred and her girls,&rdquo; said Mordaunt.  &ldquo;I should think she&rsquo;d enjoy doing it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale drove in the park three or four afternoons  a week at the fashionable hour, when carriages had to move slowly, and mounted policemen  were keeping the way clear for the passing of royal personages. Some of her women  friends bowed to her coldly, and she returned the salute with the same distance.  The men lounging by the railings were on the alert to acknowledge a bow from her;  but she had a way of not seeing them that they could hardly call offensive. The  more strait-laced among the women looked at her with unrecognizing eyes; and she  gave them back the same blank stare. Young, very handsome, exquisitely dressed by  the <i>faiseuse</i> at the top of the mode, and seated in a victoria whose every detail,  from the blood horses to the men&rsquo;s gloves and collars, was perfection, she drove  to and fro, knowing herself under a dark cloud of undeserved disgrace. Anger was  her strongest feeling. Her heart beat fast, and her cheek flushed as she drove past  those treacherous women whom she had called friends. She had not cultivated sentimental  friendships in the fashionable world. She had no <i>alter ego</i>, no bosom friend, in  society. But she had liked people, and had believed they liked her; and it was difficult  to think they could insult her by giving credence to such a preposterous story as  some idiots had set on foot.</p>
<p>She sought no society, sent out no invitations to the  intimates of old, the girls who had made her little court of adorers, her Queen&rsquo;s  Maries, whose hats and gloves had so often figured in her milliner&rsquo;s bills, since  if a nice girl were assisting at her own choice of head-gear, and cast longing looks  upon some sparkling vision of roses and leghorn, or ostrich feathers and spangled  lace, what more natural than to insist upon buying the things for her, in spite  of all protests. She had scattered such gifts with lavish hands, forgetting all  about them till surprised by the total of her milliner&rsquo;s bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I have spent so much on finery in a single season?  Ah, by-the-by, I gave Kate Holloway a hat, and Emily Dashwood an ostrich fan, and  Laura Vane had an ostrich boa, and a dozen long gloves. There are ever so many things  I had forgotten.&rdquo; And now the Lauras and Emilys and Kates had other patronesses  to eke out the paternal allowance, and they went gaily down the stream with the  people who thought evil of Lady Perivale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never were really intimate with her, don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;  they explained, to acquaintance who had seen them in her barouche or in her opera-box  three or four times a week.</p>
<p>Her opera-box had been one of her chief splendours,  a large box on the grand tier. Music was her delight, and except for a scratch performance  of II Trovatore or La Traviata, she had seldom been absent from her place. It was  at the opera that Colonel Rannock had been most remarkable in his attendance upon  her. She liked him to be there, for it was pleasant to have the sympathy of a fine  musician, whose critical faculty made him a delightful guide through the labyrinth  of a Wagnerian opera. Their heads had been often seen bending over the score, he  explaining, she listening as if enthralled. To the unmusical, that study of Wagner&rsquo;s  orchestration seemed the thinnest pretext for confidential whispers, for lips hovering  too near perfumed tresses and jewelled throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to inquire for the <i>Leitmotif</i>, there,&rdquo; said  the men in the stalls; and it was generally supposed that Lady Perivale meant to  marry Colonel Rannock, in spite of all that the world had to say against him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she hadn&rsquo;t carried on desperately with him last  year one might hardly believe the story,&rdquo; said the people who had accepted the truth  of the rumour without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>She occupied her opera-box this year, resplendent in  satin and diamonds, radiating light on a tiara night from the circlet of stars and  roses that trembled on their delicate wires as she turned her head from the stage  to the auditorium. She had her visitors as of old: <i>attach&eacute;s</i>, ambassadors even, literary  men, musical men, painters, politicians. Coldly as she received them, she could  not snub them, she could not keep them at bay altogether; and, after all, she had  no grudge against the foreigners, and her box scintillated with stars on a gala  night. It pleased her to face her detractors in that public arena, conspicuous by  her beauty and her jewels.</p>
<p>There were waverers who would have liked to go to laugh  off the story of her infamy; but the fiat had gone forth, and she was taboo. The  bellwether had scrambled up the bank and passed through the gap in the hedge, and  all the other sheep must follow in that leading animal&rsquo;s steps. Life is too short  for individual choice in a case of this kind.</p>
<p>She had half a mind to go to the May Drawing-room, and  had no fear of repulse from Court officials, who are ever slow to condemn; but,  on reflection, she decided against that act of self-assertion. She would not seem  to appeal against the sentence that had been pronounced against her by confronting  her traducers before the face of royalty. The card for the Marlborough House garden-party  came in due course, but she made an excuse for being absent. She would not hazard  an appearance which might cause annoyance to the Princess, who would perhaps have  been told afterwards that Lady Perivale ought not to have been asked, and that it  was an act of insolence in such a person to have written her name in the sacred  book when she came to London.</p>
<p>But June had not come yet, and the royal garden-party  was still a thing of the future.</p>
<p>As yet Lady Perivale had taken no trouble to discover  how the slanderous story had been circulated, or who the people were who pretended  to have met her. She could not bring herself to search out the details of a scandal  that so outraged all her feelings &mdash; her pride, her self-respect, her belief in friendship  and human kindness.</p>
<p>She had made no attempt to justify herself. She had  accepted the situation in a spirit of dogged resentment, and she faced her little  world with head erect, and eyes that gave scorn for scorn, and the only sign of  feeling was the fever spot that burnt on her cheek sometimes, when she passed the  friends of last year.</p>
<p>She had been living in Grosvenor Square more than a month, and her  drawing-room windows were wide open on a balcony full of May flowers, when the butler  announced &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Morningside,&rdquo; and a stout, comfortable-looking  matron, in a grey satin pelisse and an early Victorian bonnet, rolled in upon her  solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I am so glad to find you at home and alone,&rdquo;  said Lady Morningside, shaking hands in her hearty fashion, and seating herself  in a capacious grandfather chair. &ldquo;I have come for a confidential talk. I only came to London three days ago. I have been at Wiesbaden about these wretched  eyes of mine. He can&rsquo;t do much&rdquo;, name understand &ldquo;but he does something, and that  keeps my spirits up&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry you have been suffering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it wasn&rsquo;t very bad. An excuse for being away&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been at Wiesbaden, Marchioness? Then you haven&rsquo;t heard  &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? How handsome you are lookin&rsquo;. But a little too  pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard that I am shunned like an influenza  patient, on account of a miserable slander that I am utterly unable to focus or  to refute&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that, dear Lady Perivale. You will have to  refute the scandal, and show these people that they were fools to swallow it. Yes,  I have heard the story &mdash; insisted upon as if it were gospel truth; and I don&rsquo;t believe  a word of it. The man was seen, I dare say, and there was a woman with him; but  the woman wasn&rsquo;t you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless a woman could be in Italy and Algiers  at the same time, Lady Morningside. I was living from November to April at my villa  in the olive woods above Porto Maurizio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had English visitors comin&rsquo; and goin&rsquo;, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a living creature from England. I use up all my vitality in  a London season, and I go to Italy to be alone with my spirit friends,  the choicest, the dearest &mdash; Mozart, Mendelssohn, Shakespeare, Browning. I think  one can hardly feel Browning&rsquo;s poetry out of Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a pity. I don&rsquo;t mean about Browning, though  I do take half a page of his rigmarole sometimes with my early cup of tea, my only  time for reading &mdash; but it&rsquo;s a pity that you hadn&rsquo;t some gossiping visitor, who could  go about tellin&rsquo; everybody they were with you in Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my old servants, who travelled with me, and  never had me out of their sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very useful if you wanted their evidence in a court  of law but you can&rsquo;t send them to fight your battle at tea-parties, as you could  any woman friend &mdash; that clever Susan Rodney, for instance. You and she are such  pals! Why wasn&rsquo;t she with you part of the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She cannot leave her pupils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor creature! Well, it&rsquo;s a hard case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is less hard since I know there&rsquo;s one great lady  who believes in me,&rdquo; said Grace, holding out her hand to the Marchioness in a gush  of gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I never believe any scandal &mdash; even against  a woman I detest, and when I want to believe it &mdash; until I have had mathematical  proof of it. And I don&rsquo;t believe this of you even if twenty people are going about  London who swore  they met you honeymooning with that wretch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty people! Oh, Lady Morningside! Susan Rodney spoke  of three or four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was some time ago, perhaps. There are at least  twenty now who declare they saw you &mdash; saw you &mdash; in Algiers  &mdash; Sardinia &mdash; on board the Messageries steamer &mdash;  Lord knows where. And they all swear that they thought you one of the nicest women  in London &mdash; only they can&rsquo;t go on knowing you, on account of their daughters &mdash; their  daughters, who read Zola, and Anatole France, and Gabriele d&rsquo;Annunzio, and talk  about &rsquo;em to the men who take them in to dinner, and borrow money of their dressmakers?  I have only one daughter, and I&rsquo;m never afraid of shocking <i>her</i>. She has worked for  a year in an East-end hospital, and she knows twice as much about human wickedness  as I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t believe a word of this story, Marchioness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable. But I know that Rannock is the kind  of man my husband calls a bad egg; and I think you were not very wise in having  him about you so much last season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, he wanted to marry me &mdash; for the sake of my  money, no doubt &mdash; they are so much and I refused him three times &mdash; and he took my  refusal so nicely &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of the worst-tempered men in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And said, &lsquo;Since we are not to be lovers, let us at  least be pals.&rsquo; And the man is clever &mdash; likes the books I like, and the music I  like, and plays the &rsquo;cello wonderfully, for an amateur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know the wretch is clever. A fine manner, the  well-born Scotchman, polished on the Continent, what women call a magnetic man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked him, and thought people were hard upon him  &mdash; and I had been warned that he was dangerous&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that was enough! To tell a young woman that a man  is a villain is the surest way to awaken her interest in him. It is only at my age  that one comes to understand that the man everybody abuses is no better than the  common herd&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I let him come and go in quite an easy way, as  if he had been a cousin, and we played <i>concertante</i> duets sometimes, in wet weather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And people found him here, and saw him with you out-of-doors,  and they were talking about you last season, though you didn&rsquo;t know it. You are  too handsome and too rich to escape. The women envy you your looks; the men envy  you your income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not to suppose I ever cared about Colonel Rannock.  I liked his playing, and his conversation amused me &mdash; and the more people told me  that the Rannocks were unprincipled and disreputable, the more determined I was  to be civil to him. One gets so tired of the good people who have never done wrong;  and one doesn&rsquo;t take much account of a man&rsquo;s morals when he&rsquo;s only an acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what my daughter would say. Goodness and  badness with her are only differences in the measurement of the cerebrum. She&rsquo;d  consort with an escaped murderer if she thought him clever. Well, my dear child,  you must come to my ball on the fifteenth of June. I am told it will be the event  of the season, though there&rsquo;s to be no ruinous fancy-dress nonsense, not even powdered  heads, only a white frock and all your diamonds. I am asking everybody to wear white,  and I shall have a mass of vivid colour in the decorations, banks of gloxinias,  every shade of purple and crimson, and orange-coloured Chinese lanterns, like that  picture of Sargent&rsquo;s that we once raved about. You will all look like sylphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Marchioness, it will be a delicious ball. I know  how you do things. But I can cross no one&rsquo;s threshold till my character is cleared.  My character! Good Heavens, that I should live to talk of my character, like a housemaid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come &mdash; in a white frock &mdash; and all your diamonds?  They would cringe to you. I know what they are &mdash; the silly sheep! You see, they  are good enough to call me a leader, and when they see you at my party, and Morningside  walking about with you, they&rsquo;ll know what fools they&rsquo;ve been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Marchioness, you have a heart of gold! But I must  right myself. I must do it off my own bat, as the men say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a pig-headed puss! Perhaps you&rsquo;ll think better  of it between now and the fifteenth &mdash; nearly a month. I want to have all the pretty  people. And you are a prime favourite of my husband&rsquo;s. If duelling weren&rsquo;t out of  date I should fear for his life. I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;d be for shootin&rsquo; somebody on your  account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are weak mortals, when we are civilized, and live  in the best society, and that visit of Lady Morningside&rsquo;s, that hearty kindness  from a motherly woman who had fashion and influence, exercised a soothing and a  stimulating effect on Grace Perivale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a fool to sit quiet under such an atrocious calumny,&rdquo;  she thought. &ldquo;There must be some way of letting the world know that I was spending  my winter alone in my Italian villa, while some short-sighted fools thought they  saw me in Africa. It ought not to be difficult.  I must get some one to help me, somebody who knows the world. Oh, how I wish I could  go to law with somebody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That word &ldquo;law&rdquo; reminded her of the man whose wisdom  Sir Hector had believed infallible, and whose advice he had taken in all business  matters, the management of his estate, the form of his new investments. Mr. Harding,  the old family lawyer, was Hector&rsquo;s idea of incarnate caution, &ldquo;a long-headed fellow,&rdquo;  the essence of truth and honesty, and as rich as Cr&oelig;sus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t I think of him before?&rdquo; Lady Perivale wondered.  &ldquo;Of course he is the proper person to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sent a groom with a note to Mr. Harding&rsquo;s office  in Bedford Row, begging him to call upon her before he went home; but it was past  five o&rsquo;clock when the man arrived at the office, and Mr. Harding had left at four.</p>
<p>He had a sumptuous modern Queen Anne house at Beckenham,  moved in the best &mdash; Beckenham and Bickley &mdash; society, and amused himself by the  cultivation of orchids, in a mild way. He did not affect specimens that cost &pound;200  a piece and required a gardener to sit up all night with them. He talked of his  orchids deprecatingly as poor things, which he chose for their prettiness, not for  their rarity. He liked to potter about from hothouse to hothouse, in the long summer  afternoons, and to feel that out of parchment and foolscap and ferret he had created  this suburban paradise.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale had a telegram from him before eleven  o&rsquo;clock next morning.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I shall do myself the pleasure of calling at 4.30.  Impossible earlier. &mdash; JOSEPH HARDING.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another Harding, a younger brother, in the  firm, and a certain Peterson, who had his own clients, and his own walk in life,  which took him mostly to Basinghall    Street; but Joseph Harding was the man of weight, family  solicitor and conveyancer, learned in the laws of real property, the oracle whom  landed proprietors and titled personages consulted.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;For thee I&rsquo;ll lock up all the gates of love,<br>
  And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,<br>
  To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,<br>
  And never shall it more be gracious.<br>
  O, she is fallen<br>
  Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea<br>
Hath drops too few to wash her clean again,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace Perivale could hardly live through the day, while  she was waiting for the appearance of the family solicitor. Since Lady Morningside&rsquo;s  visit she had been on fire with impatience to do something, wise or foolish, futile  or useful, towards clearing her character. She had been all the more eager, perhaps,  because in her morning ride she had seen a man whose scorn &mdash; or that grave distance  which she took for scorn &mdash; pained her more than the apostasy of all her other friends.</p>
<p>She had ridden in the park with &ldquo;the liver brigade&rdquo;  three or four mornings a week, since her return from Italy, and she had found some trouble  in keeping the men she knew at a distance. They all wanted to be talkative and friendly,  praised her mount, hung at her side till she froze them by her brief answers, warned  them that her horse hated company, that her mare was inclined to kick other horses,  and then, with a light touch of her whip, cantered sharply off, and left the officious  acquaintance planted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t expect her to be amiable when our wives and  daughters are so d &mdash; d uncivil to her,&rdquo; mused one of her admirers.</p>
<p>Some among the husbands and brothers of her friends  had taken sides for her, and argued that the story of her intrigue with Rannock  was not proven; but the women had heard it too often and from too many quarters  to doubt. They sighed, and shook their heads, and deplored that it was impossible  to go on knowing a woman of whom such a story was told.</p>
<p>They might not have believed it, they argued, had she  not obviously been head over ears in love with Rannock last season. They had always  been about together &mdash; at Ascot, Goodwood, at all  the classical concerts, at the opera. True, she had seldom been alone with him.  There had generally been other women and other men of the party; but Rannock had  undoubtedly been <i>the</i> man.</p>
<p>That one man whose opinion Grace cared for, whose good  word might have been balm in Gilead, was not a  man of fashion. Arthur Haldane was a student, and he only appeared occasionally  in the haunts of the frivolous, where he was not above taking his recreation, now  and then, after the busy solitude of his working days and nights. He was a Balliol  man, had known and been cherished by Jowett in his undergraduate days, and had taken  a first in classics. He might have had a fellowship had he desired it, but he wanted  a more stirring part in life than the learned leisure of a college. He was a barrister  by profession, but he had not loved the law, nor the law him; and, having an income  that allowed him not to work for daily bread, after about a dozen briefs spaced  over a year and a half, he had taken to literature, which had been always his natural  bent, and the realm of letters had received him with acclaim. His rivals ascribed  his success to luck, and to a certain lofty aloofness which kept his work original.  He never wrote with an eye to the market, never followed another man&rsquo;s lead, nor  tried to repeat his own successes, and never considered whether the thing he wrote  was wanted or not, would or would not pay.</p>
<p>He was a prodigious reader, but a reader who dwelt in  the past, and who read the books he loved again and again, till all that was finest  in the master-minds of old was woven into the fabric of his brain. He seldom looked  at a new book, except when he was asked to review one for a certain Quarterly to  which he had contributed since the beginning of his career. He was the most conscientious  of reviewers; if he loved the book, the most sympathetic; if he hated it, the most  unmerciful.</p>
<p>One only work of fiction, published before he was thirty,  had marked him as a writer of original power. It was a love story, supposed to be  told by the man who had lived it, the story of a man who had found a creature of  perfect loveliness and absolute purity in one of the darkest spots on earth, had  snatched her unstained from the midst of pollution, had placed her in the fairest  environment, watched the growth of her mind with the tenderest interest, looked  forward to the blissful day when he could make her his wife, and then, when she  had ripened into a perfect woman, had seen her ruin and untimely death, the innocent  victim of a relentless seducer.</p>
<p>The tragic story &mdash; which involved a close study of two  strongly contrasted characters, the deep-thinking and ambitious man, and the child  of nature whose every thought was poetry, whose every word was music &mdash; had stirred  the hearts of novel-readers, and had placed Arthur Haldane in the front rank of  contemporary novelists; but he had produced no second novel, and many of his feminine  admirers declared that the story was the tragedy of his own life, and that, although  he dined out two or three times a week in the season, he was a broken-hearted man.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this idea that had first interested Lady  Perivale. She saw in Arthur Haldane the man of one book and one fatal love. She  longed to question him about his Egeria of the slums, the girl of fourteen, exquisitely  beautiful, whom he had torn from the clutches of a profligate mother, while her  father was in a convict prison. She was quite ready to accept the fiction as sober  truth, beguiled by that stern realism from which the writer had never departed,  but through which there ran a vein of deep poetic feeling.</p>
<p>She was surprised to find no trace of melancholy in  his conversation. He did not wear his broken heart upon his sleeve. His manner was  grave, and he liked talking of serious things &mdash; books, politics, the agitated theology  of the day &mdash; but he had a keen sense of humour, and could see the mockery of life.  He was not as handsome as Rannock was, even in his decadence, but his strongly marked  features had the stamp of intellectual power, and his rare smile lightened the thoughtful  face like sudden sunshine. He was tall and well set up, had thrown the hammer in  his Oxford days,  and had rowed in the Balliol boat.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale had liked to talk to him, and had invited  him to her best dinners, the smaller parties of chosen spirits, so difficult to  bring together, as they were mostly the busiest people, so delightful when caught.  It was at one of these little dinners, a party of six, that she beguiled Haldane  into talking of the origin of his novel. The company was sympathetic, including  a well-known cosmopolitan novelist, painter of manners and phases of feeling, and  all the intricacies of modern life, the fine-drawn, the hypercivilized life that  creates its perplexities and cultivates its sorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The average reader will give a story-spinner credit  for anything in the world except imagination,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I am sure Mr. Williams  knows that&rdquo; &mdash; with a smiling glance across the table at the novelist of many countries.  &ldquo;They will have it that every story is a page torn out of a life, and the more improbable  the story the more determined are they that it should be real flesh and blood. Yet  there is often a central fact in the web of fancy, an infinitesimal point, but the  point from which all the lines radiate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there was such a germ in your story?&rdquo; Lady Perivale  asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there was one solid fact &mdash; a child &mdash; a poor little  half-starved girl-child. I was passing through a wretched alley between the Temple and Holborn, when a  dishevelled brat rushed out of a house and almost fell into my arms. A man had been  beating her &mdash; a child of nine years old &mdash; beating her unmercifully with a leather  strap. I went into the house, and caught him red-handed. He was her uncle. There  was an aunt somewhere, out upon the drink, the man said, as if it was a profession.  I didn&rsquo;t want to go through tedious proceedings &mdash; call in the aid of this or that  society. The man swore the child was a bad lot, a thief, a liar. I bought her of  him for a sovereign, bought her as if she had been a terrier pup, and before night  I had her comfortably lodged in a cottage at Slough,  with a woman who promised to be king to her, and to bring her up respectably.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she very pretty?&rdquo; Lady Perivale asked, deeply interested.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unfortunately &mdash; or perhaps fortunately for herself  &mdash; she was an ugly child, and has grown into a plain girl; but she is as frank and  honest as the daylight, and she is doing well as scullery-maid in a good family.  My Slough cottager did her duty. That, Lady Perivale,  is the nucleus of my story. I imagined circumstance more romantic &mdash; dazzling beauty,  a poetic temperament, a fatal love &mdash; and my child of the slums grew into a heroine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that is the way novels are manufactured,&rdquo; said  Mr. Williams; &ldquo;but Haldane ought not to be so ready to tell the tricks of our trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace Perivale and Arthur Haldane had been friends,  but nothing more. There had been no suggestion of any deeper feeling, though when  their friendship began, two seasons ago, it had seemed to her as if there might to  something more. She looked back at last year, and saw that Colonel Rannock and his  &rsquo;cello had kept this more valued friend at a distance. She remembered Haldane calling  upon her one afternoon when she and Rannock were playing a duet, and how quickly  he had gone, with apologies for having interrupted their music.</p>
<p>She had met him three or four times of late among the  morning riders, and he had neither courted nor avoided her recognition, which had  been cold and formal. She did not take the initiative in cutting people, for that  would have looked as if she had something to be ashamed of. She only made all salutations  as distant as possible.</p>
<p>She stayed at home all day playing, reading, walking  about her room, looking at the flowers, sitting in the balcony, which she had shaded  with a striped awning, trying to make it like Italy. She was too eager for the old  lawyer&rsquo;s visit to apply her mind seriously to anything.</p>
<p>The poodle, who followed all her movements with a tepid  interest, wondered at her restlessness, and was glad when the maid came to take  him for his afternoon airing in the park, where he ran on the flower-beds, and was  regarded as an enemy by the park-keepers.</p>
<p>Half-past four came at last, and Mr. Harding was announced  on the stoke of the half-hour. Lady Perivale received him in her largest drawing-room.  She did not want him to see all the frivolities &mdash; <i>jardini&egrave;res</i>, book-stands, easels,  eccentric work-baskets, and fantastical china monsters &mdash; of her den, lest he should  think lightly of her. The Louis Seize drawing-rooms, with their large buhl cabinets,  holding treasures of old S&egrave;vres and Dresden,  were serious enough for the reception-rooms of a Lord Chief Justice or an Archbishop.  Even her dress was severe, a blue cloth gown, with only a little bullion embroidery  on the primrose satin waistcoat. Her dark auburn hair was brushed back from the  broad brow, and her hazel eyes, with golden lights in them, looked grave and anxious,  as she shook hands with the family counselor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please choose a comfortable chair, Mr. Harding,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;I have a long story to tell you. But perhaps you have heard it already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harding looked mystified. He was a tall, broad-shouldered  man of about sixty, with a massive brow and a benevolent head, and a countenance  that had acquired dignity since his sandy hair and foxy beard had turned to silver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Lady Perivale, I have heard nothing involving  your interests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I shall have to begin at the beginning.  It is a horrid business, but so preposterous that one could almost laugh at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She proceeded to tell him how her friends had treated  her, and the story that had been going about London. He listened gravely, and looked shocked  and pained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have really heard nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a syllable. My wife and I only visit among our  country neighbours, and I suppose Beckenham people know very little of what is being  talked about in London  society. Our conversation is chiefly local, or about church matters. I never speak  of my clients, so no one would know of my interest in your welfare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my good name, which is more than my welfare. Now,  Mr. Harding, advise me. What am I to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer looked deeply concerned, but with the air  of a man who saw no light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very difficult case,&rdquo; he said, after a pause.  &ldquo;Has there been anything in the newspapers, any insolent paragraph in those columns  which are devoted to trivial personalities? I don&rsquo;t mean to imply that this is trivial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have heard of nothing in the newspapers &mdash; and  I have a friend who is always out and about, and who would have been sure to hear  of such a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harding was silent for some moments, pulling his  beard with his large white hand in a meditative way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen Colonel Rannock since this story got  about?&rdquo; he asked</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Colonel Rannock is in the Rocky   Mountains. Ought I to see him if he were in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, Lady Perivale; but I think if he were  within reach you should send a friend &mdash; myself, for instance, as your legal adviser  &mdash; to call upon him to contradict this story, and to assure your common friends in  a quiet way, that you were not the companion of his travels. He could not refuse  to do that, though, of course, it would be an unpleasant thing to do as involving  the reputation of the person who was with him, and to whom,&rdquo; added the lawyer, after  a pause, &ldquo;he might consider himself especially accountable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no doubt all his chivalry would be for her,&rdquo; said  Grace, bitterly. &ldquo;I would give the world to know who the creature is &mdash; so like me  that three or four different people declare they saw me &mdash; me &mdash; in three or four  different places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know of no one &mdash; you have no double in your own  set?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can recall no one who was ever considered very  like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer looked at her with a grave smile. No, there  were not many women made in that mould. The splendid hazel eyes &mdash; <i>les yeux d&rsquo;or</i>  &mdash; the burnished gold in the dark-brown hair, the perfect eyelids and long auburn  lashes the delicate aquiline nose and short upper lip with its little look of hauteur,  the beautifully-modelled chin with a dimple in it, and the marble white of a throat  such as sculptors love &mdash; no, that kind of woman is not to be matched as easily as  a skein of silk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, Lady Perivale, the first and most important  step is to discover the identity of this person who has been mistaken for you,&rdquo;  Mr. Harding said gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course!&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;Will you  &mdash; will your firm &mdash; do that for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no, it is hardly in our line. But in delicate  matters of this kind I have occasionally &mdash; I may say frequently &mdash; employed a very  clever man, whom I can conscientiously recommend to you; and if you will explain  the circumstances to him, as you have to me, and tell him all you can about this  Colonel Rannock, family surroundings, tastes, habits &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, if you are sure he is to be trusted. Is he  a lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lawyers do not do these things. Mr. Faunce is a detective,  who retired from the Criminal Investigation Department some years ago, and who occasionally  employs himself in private cases. I have known him give most valuable service in  family matters of exceeding delicacy. I believe he would work your case <i>con amore</i>.  It is the kind of thing that would appeal to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let me see him &mdash; this evening. There is not an  hour to be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will telegraph to him when I leave you. But he may  be away from London.  His business takes him to the Continent very often. You may have to wait some time  before he is free to work for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not long, I hope. I am devoured with impatience. But  can you &mdash; can the law of the land &mdash; do nothing for me? Can&rsquo;t I bring an action against  somebody?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not under the present aspect of affairs. If you were  in a different walk of life &mdash; a governess, for instance, or a domestic servant,  and you were refused a situation on account of something specific that had been  said against you &mdash; an action might lie, you might claim damages. It would be a case  for a jury. But in your position, the slander being unwritten, a floating rumour,  it would hardly be possible to focus your wrongs, from a legal point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the law is very one-sided,&rdquo; said Grace, pettishly,  &ldquo;if a housemaid can get redress and I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Harding did not argue the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have seen Faunce, and he has worked up the  case, we may be able to hit upon something in Bedford Row, Lady Perivale,&rdquo; he said  blandly, as he rose and took up his highly respectable hat, whose shape had undergone  no change for a quarter of a century.</p>
<p>There was a new hat of the old shape always ready for  him in the little shop in St. James&rsquo;s Street, and the shopman could have put his  hand upon the hatbox in the dark.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter6"></a>Chapter 6</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Love is by fancy led about,<br>
From hope to fear, from joy to doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a week before John Faunce appeared upon the troubled  scene of Grace Perivale&rsquo;s life. He had been in Vienna, and he called in Grosvenor Square at half-past nine o&rsquo;clock  on the evening of his return, in answer to three urgent letters from her ladyship  which he found on his office table in Essex    Street.</p>
<p>Susan Rodney had been dining with her friend, and they  were taking their coffee in the morning-room when Faunce was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring the gentleman here,&rdquo; Lady Perivale told the servant,  and then turned to Miss Rodney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind, do you, Sue? If you have never seen  a detective, it may be rather interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind? No! I am as keen as you are about this business.  What a fool I was not to suggest a detective at the beginning. I shall love to see  and talk with a detective. I have been longing to meet one all my life. <i>Unberufen</i>,&rdquo;  added Miss Rodney, rapping the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Faunce,&rdquo; said the butler; and a serious looking,  middle-aged man, of medium height and strong frame, with broad, high forehead, kindly  black eyes, and short, close-cut black whiskers, came into the room.</p>
<p>There was a pleasant shrewdness in his countenance, and his manner was easy without being familiar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be seated, Mr. Faunce,&rdquo; said Lady. Perivale. &ldquo;I  am very glad to see you. This lady is Miss Rodney, my particular friend, from whom  I have no secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce bowed to Miss Rodney, before seating himself  very composedly outside the circle of light under the big lamp-shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must apologize for coming so late in the evening,  madam; but I only arrived at my office, from Dover, an hour ago; and, as your letters  seemed somewhat urgent  &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a moment too late. I would have seen you  at midnight. But &mdash; perhaps you have not had time to dine. We have only just left  the dining-room. Will you let them get you some dinner there before we begin our  business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship is too good. I dined on the boat &mdash; a  saving of time &mdash; and am quite at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale told her story, Faunce watching her all  the time with those tranquil eyes of his, never very keen, never restless. They  were absorbent eyes, that took hold of things and held them tight; and behind the  eyes there was a memory that never failed.</p>
<p>He watched and listened. He had heard such stories before  &mdash; stories of mistaken identity. They were somewhat common in divorce court business,  and he very seldom believed them, or found that they would hold water. Nor had he  a high opinion of women of fashion &mdash; women who lived in rooms like this, where a  reckless outlay was the chief characteristic, where choicest flowers bloomed for  a day, and delicate satin pillows were tossed about the carpet for dogs to lie upon,  and toys of gold and silver, jewelled watches, and valuable miniatures, were crowded  upon tables to invite larceny. Yet it seemed to him that Lady Perivale&rsquo;s voice rang  true, or else that she was a more accomplished actress than those other women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Harding was right, madam,&rdquo; he said, when he had  heard her to the end, and had questioned her closely upon some details. &ldquo;We must  find out who your double is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that will be difficult, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may take time and patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it will be costly no doubt; but you need not be  afraid of spending money. I have no father or brother to take my part; no man-friend  who cares enough for me &mdash;&rdquo; She stopped, with something like a sob in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing but my money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not a bad thing to begin the battle with, Lady  Perivale, &ldquo;answered Faunce, with his shrewd smile; &ldquo;but money is not quite such  an important factor in my operations as most people think. If things cannot be found  out in a fairly cheap manner they cannot be found out at all. When a detective tells  you he has to offer large bribes to get information, you may take it from me that  he is either a fool or a cheat. Common sense is the thing we have most use for,  and a capacity for putting two and two together and making the result equal a hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when you have found this shameless creature what  are we to do? Mr. Harding says I can&rsquo;t bring an action for slander, because I am  not a housemaid, and loss of character doesn&rsquo;t mean loss of my daily bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are other kinds of actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What &mdash; what action that I could bring? I should like  to go to law with every friend I ever had. I think I shall spend the rest of my  days in the law courts, pleading my own cause, like that pretty lady whose name  I forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might bring an action for libel, if you had a case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I have not been libelled &mdash; a libel must be written  and published, must it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the meaning of the word, madam,&mdash;&lsquo;a little book.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh that my enemy would write a book about me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure there has been no offensive allusion to  this rumour in any of the newspapers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I tell? I have not been watching the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should advise you to send a guinea to Messrs. Rosset  and Son, the Press agents, who will search the papers for your name, and save you  the trouble.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale made a hurried note of Messrs. Rosset&rsquo;s  address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An action for lebel, if any one libelled me &mdash; what  would that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wuld mean a thorough sifting of your case before  a jury, by two of the cleverest counsel we could get. It would mean bringing your  double into the witness-box, if possible, and making her declare herself Colonel  Rannock&rsquo;s companion in those places where you are said to have been seen with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; that would be conclusive. And all those cold-hearted  creatures, whom I once called friends, would be sorry &mdash; sorry and ashamed of themselves.  But if there is no libel &mdash; if people go on talking and talking, and nobody ever  publishes the slander &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your mind easy, Lady Perivale. When we are ready  for it <i>there will be a libel</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may safely leave the matter in my hands, madam,  and in Mr. Harding&rsquo;s. If I succeed in finding the lady who resembles you, the rest  will not be difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think you will find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to try. I shall start for Algiers tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I give you a cheque for travelling expenses?&rdquo; Lady  Perivale asked, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is as you please, madam. You may leave my account  to be settled by Mr. Harding, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, giing to her davenport. &ldquo;In spite  of what you say about money, I want you to have plenty of cash in hand, to feel  that you have no occasion to stint outlay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I never do, when character is at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She handed him a hastily written cheque for five hundred  pounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a high figure, madam, to start with,&rdquo; said  Faunce, as he slipped the cheque into his letter case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only a trifle on account. Call upon me for  whatever sums you require. I would rather beggar myself than exist under this odious  imputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing more I must ask for, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your photograph, if you will be so good as to trust  me with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My photograph?&rdquo; wonderlingly, and with a touch of hauteur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will help me identify your double.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course! I understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened a drawer and took out a cabinet photograph  of herself, choosing the severest dress and simplest attitude.</p>
<p>Faunce promised to report progress from Algiers. If he drew blank there,  he would go on to Corsica and Sardinia. He would  have bowed himself out of the room, with a respectful distance, but Grace held out  her hand to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe in me, don&rsquo;t you, Mr. Faunce?&rdquo; she said,  as they shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t always believe in your clients, I think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce smiled an enigmatic smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have some queer clients now and then,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>He had taken up his hat, and Lady Perivale&rsquo;s hand was  upon the bell, when Susan broke in suddenly, exclaiming &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ring, Grace. Pray don&rsquo;t go, Mr. Faunce, unless  you are in a desperate hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in no hurry, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then pray sit down again, and let us have a little  talk with you &mdash; now that we have done with Lady Perivale&rsquo;s business. Do you know  that, ever since I read the &lsquo;Moonstone&rsquo; &mdash; and I was little more than a child when  I read that most enthralling book &mdash; I have been longing to meet a detective &mdash; a  real detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel honoured, madam, for my profession. People are  apt to think unkindly of our trade, though they can&rsquo;t do without us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was still standing with his hat in his hand, waiting  for some sign from Lady Perivale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is full of injustice,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Pray sit  down, Mr. Faunce, and gratify my friend&rsquo;s curiosity about the mysteries of your  art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am flattered, madam, to find a lady interested in  such dry work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dry!&rdquo; cried Susan; &ldquo;why, it is the quintessence of  fiction and the drama. And now, Mr. Faunce, tell me, to begin with, how you ever  contrive to track people down when once they have got a fair start?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, as we don&rsquo;t do it by following them  about, the start doesn&rsquo;t much matter, provided we can pick up a trace of them somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that&rsquo;s where the wonder is! How do you pick  up the first trace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s a secret! &ldquo;Faunce answered gravely; and  then, after a pause, smiling at Susan Rodney&rsquo;s eager face, all aglow in the lamplight,  he added, &ldquo;We generally have to leave that to the chapter of accidents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is only a fluke when you run a man down?&rdquo; asked  Susan.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale was sitting on the sofa, caressing the  irresponsive poodle, and too deep in thought about her own case to be greatly concerned  in the secrets of Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s calling. She was glad for her friend to be amused,  and that was all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite a fluke,&rdquo; replied Faunce. &ldquo;We expect  a fugitive to do something foolish, something that puzzles some thick-headed person,  who communicates with the police. A great deal of our information comes from the  outside public, you see, madam. It&rsquo;s often good for nothing; but there&rsquo;s a little  gold among the quartz.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the fugitive is too clever for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, even if our man plays the game, we are on the  look out for his moves. You see, my lady,&rdquo; turning to Lady Perivale, whose obvious  indifference piqued him, &ldquo;an old hand like me has a good many friends scattered  up and down the world. I am able to put a good thing in the way of my friends every  now and then. Consequently they are anxious to help me if they can, and they keep  their eyes open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of people are these friends of yours, Mr.  Faunce?&rdquo; asked Lady Perivale, feeling that the detective&rsquo;s shrewd eyes were upon  her face, and that he wanted her to be interested in his discourse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another secret, a secret of the trade. I can  only answer questions about myself, not about my friends. But I might suggest that  the porter of a large Metropolitan hotel, anywhere on the main stream of travel,  would be a useful ally for a man like me. Then there are people who have retired  from the French or English police, who are fond of their old work, and not too proud  to undertake an odd job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these people help you?&rdquo; asked Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Rodney&rdquo; &mdash; the name clearly spoken; no mumbled  substitute for a name imperfectly heard, or forgotten as soon as heard. John Faunce&rsquo;s  educated memory registered every name at the first hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Experience has taught me never to task them beyond  their power. That&rsquo;s the keystone of my business. Only the other day, my lady&rdquo; &mdash;  addressing himself pointedly to Lady Perivale, in whom he saw signs of flagging  attention, &ldquo;I nearly let some one slip through my fingers by overtaxing the ability  of one of my agents. I had great confidence in the man &mdash; a first-rate watcher! Tell  him to look out for a particular person at a particular place, and, sure as that  person came to that place, my man would spot him, and most likely would find out  where he went. Well, I gave the fellow a little job last week that required delicate  handling &mdash; a good many discreet questions had to be put to a certain person&rsquo;s domestics,  and no alarm raised in their minds that might communicate itself to their master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did your man prove a failure?&rdquo; Miss Rodney asked  eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did, madam. He overdid the part &mdash; gave himself away,  as the Yankees say. The bird was scared off the nest, took wing for foreign parts,  and I might have lost him altogether. But it wasn&rsquo;t my man&rsquo;s fault. He is quite  reliable at his own work &mdash; watching. It was my own fault. I ought to have done the  thing myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do things yourself sometimes?&rdquo; Lady Perivale  asked, her interest re-awakened, since she wanted the man to give her case his individual  attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, often. I am going to Algiers, for instance, to hunt down Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s  travelling companion. I would not trust that task to the best of my agents, I may  say that, for the higher class of inquiry, I have never found any one whom I could  trust absolutely. The fact is, no one can be sufficiently keen who hasn&rsquo;t the whole  game in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you not afraid of your agents turning rogues  and trying to make money out of your clients&rsquo; secrets?&rdquo; asked Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Rodney &mdash; because I never tell them my clients&rsquo;  secrets. They have to ferret out certain facts, to watch certain people; but they  never know the why and the wherefore. Human nature is weak. I know my people. They  wouldn&rsquo;t attempt blackmail: that&rsquo;s the rock ahead in our business, Lady Perivale.  But they might talk, and I am not sure that isn&rsquo;t worse sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it is,&rdquo; said Susan; &ldquo;for the blackmailer  doesn&rsquo;t want to peach upon his victim. It&rsquo;s only a question of hard cash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you understand the business, madam. I have been  at the game a good many years, and there are things I can do that would puzzle a  younger hand. Ah, Miss Rodney,&rdquo; said Faunce, attracted by her keen and animated  expression, &ldquo;I could tell you incidents in my professional career that would make  your hair stand on end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, pray do. I adore stories of that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it is nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; glancing at the Sevres  timepiece opposite him, &ldquo;and I have already trespassed too long on Lady Perivale&rsquo;s  patience. And I have to catch a train for Putney, where I live when I am at home.  I haven&rsquo;t seen my wife for ten days, and I shall start for Marseilles at nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not often at home, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, madam. A good deal of my life is spent like Satan&rsquo;s,  &lsquo;Going to and fro in the earth, and walking up and down in it;&rsquo; and then I have  my <i>pied &agrave; terre</i> in Essex Street, where I am generally to be found for business purposes  when I am in London. I used to live in Bloomsbury, where I was always on the spot,  ready for contingencies; but when I left the Force some years ago, I took a cottage  at Putney &mdash; a petty little place enough &mdash; where my wife lives, and where I go when  I have a little leisure, and where I am supposed to be very fond of the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And don&rsquo;t you love your garden? It must be such a relief  after your exciting work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I like the garden. I find the slugs particularly  interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The slugs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s more in a slug than most people think.  His capacity has been very much underrated. Of course he&rsquo;s not a patch upon the  spider. The subtle villainy of the spider is worth a lifelong study. I know nothing  but a sixty per cent. money-lender that can touch him. And the ant &mdash; well, he&rsquo;s  a thorough-going Philistine, always moves in a grove, and doesn&rsquo;t so much appeal  to my fancy. But again, I am encroaching,&rdquo; said Faunce, standing up straight and  stiff, in an attitude reminiscent of &ldquo;the Force.&rdquo; &ldquo;I wish you good night, ladies,  and I hope your ladyship will pardon me for having prosed all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you for having given us so  much interesting information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And some day you will tell us one of your blood-curdling  stories?&rdquo; said Susan Rodney, shaking hands with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like that man!&rdquo; exclaimed Susan, when the door closed  upon him. &ldquo;I have always wanted to know a detective, like Bucket, the beloved of  my childhood; or Mr. Cuff, the idol of my riper years. You must invite Mr. Faunce  to a quiet little luncheon some day. There is no question of class distinction with  a clever man liked that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale smiled. She was accustomed to her friend&rsquo;s  enthusiasms and ultra-Liberal ideas,</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s time for me to go home, Grace. I asked Johnson  to order a cab at eleven. Oh, by-the-by, it is ages since you took a cup of tea  in my cottage. I wish you&rsquo;d come at five o&rsquo;clock next Saturday. I have picked up  an old print or two &mdash; genuine Bartolozzis &mdash; rural subjects &mdash; that I am dying to  show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love to go to you, Sue. But you may have people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; Friday is my day. I never expect any one on  Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll come. It will seem like old times &mdash; like  last year, when I had nothing on my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but that business is on Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s mind now,  and off yours. You are going to be in good spirits again; and I shall come and make  music with you once or twice a week, if you&rsquo;ll have me. There is that little German,  who fiddles so beautifully, Herr Kloster. You heard him at my party, last year.  I&rsquo;ll bring him to play duets with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be delightful; but I doubt if I shall be in  spirits for music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I am not going to let you mope. What a fool I was  not to suggest a detective the day you came home. Good night, dear. Saturday next,  as soon as you like after half-past four.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rodney lived in a pretty little house facing Regent&rsquo;s  Park, the kind of house that agents describe as a bijou residence, and which rarely  contains more than two habitable bedrooms. It was a picturesque little house, with  a white front, a verandah below, and a balcony above, and a tiny pretence of a garden,  and the rent was higher than Susan could afford when she set up in London as a teacher  of singing and the pianoforte, leaving her three sisters to vegetate in the paternal  home, a great red-brick house in a Midland market town, where their father was everybody&rsquo;s  family solicitor.</p>
<p>During the earlier years of her London career, Susan  had worked hard for her house, and for her pretty furniture, her bits of genuine  Sheraton and Chippendale, picked up cheaply in back streets and out-of-the-way corners,  her chintz curtains and chair-covers and delicate carpets. Her own maintenance,  and her one devoted servant, who did all the work of the house, yet always looked  a parlourmaid, cost so little; and, after helping the girls at home with handsome  additions to their pocket-money, Miss Rodney could afford to dress well, and keep  her house in exquisite order, every now and then adding some artistic gem to that  temple of beauty.</p>
<p>The view from her windows, her old prints, her little  bits of Lowest of china, her small but choice collection of books, were the delight  of her solitary existence; and, perhaps, there were few happier women in London  than Susan Rodney, who worked six days in the week, and rarely for less than an  eight hours&rsquo; day, and who had long ago made up her mind that for some women there  is nothing better in life than freedom from masculine control and a congenial avocation.</p>
<p>The afternoon sunshine was shining full upon the house-front  when Lady Perivale was announced; so the sliding Venetian shutters had been drawn  across the two French windows, and Miss Rodney&rsquo;s drawing-room was in shadow. Coming  in out of the vivid out-of-door light, Grace did not, on the instant, recognize  a gentleman, who rose hurriedly and took up his hat as she entered the room. But  a second glance showed her that the visitor was Arthur Haldane.</p>
<p>She shot an angry glance at Susan. Was it chance, or  some mischievous plan of hers that brought him here? They bowed to each other coldly,  and neither held out the hand of friendship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going, Mr. Haldane?&rdquo; said Susan. &ldquo;Tea will  be in directly. You must have some tea. You know I am rather proud of my tea. It  is the only thing a pauper with one servant can be proud of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &mdash; I have an engagement in the City,&rdquo; Haldane answered  rather vaguely, moving towards the door, but with his eyes on Grace Perivale&rsquo;s pale  face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The City? Why, the City will be dead asleep before  you can get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. You are very kind. I know how good your tea is.&rdquo;  He put down his hat, and dropped into a chair near the sofa where Lady Perivale  had seated herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not one of those horrid men who make  believe to like tea, and then go about reviling one for offering it to them,&rdquo; said  Susan, who foresaw a dead silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; I am a genuine tea-drinker. The male tea-drinker  is by no means a rare animal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to write another novel, Mr. Haldane?&rdquo;  asked Susan, while the inimitable parlourmaid, in a Parisian cap, was bringing in  the tea-tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been good enough to make that inquiry two  or three times a year, for the last five years. I know you think it flatters my  vanity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I shall go on asking the same question. When? When?  When?&rdquo; handing him a cup and saucer, which he carried, with the cream-jug, to Lady  Perivale, without relaxing the stiffness that had come over his manner when she  entered the room.</p>
<p>But the moment had come when he must speak to her, or  seem absolutely uncivil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think there are novelists enough between  Central Europe and London  without my pushing into the field, Lady Perivale?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you have been in the field, and have won your  battle. I think everybody would like another story from the author of &lsquo;Mary Deane.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not consider how easily people forget,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I do,&rdquo; she answered, moved by that faint tremor  in his voice which a less interested hearer might not have observed. &ldquo;You yourself  are an instance. It is just a year since you called upon me one afternoon &mdash; when  Colonel Rannock and I were playing a duet. I suppose our music frightened you, for  you stayed hardly five minutes, and you have been unconscious of my existence ever  since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was determined to speak of Rannock, to let him see  that the name was not difficult of utterance; but she could not help the sudden  flame-spot that flew into her cheeks as she spoke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I had an idea that you did not want me,&rdquo; he  said; and then his heart sickened at the thought that this woman, whom he had honoured  and admired, whose face had haunted his solitary hours, whose beauty still attracted  him with a disquieting charm, was possibly a woman of lost character, whom no self-respecting  man could ever dream of as a wife.</p>
<p>He took two or three sips out of the Swansea teacup  which Susan handed him, put it down hurriedly, snatched his hat, shook hands with  his hostess, bowed to Lady Perivale, and had left the house before even the most  alert of parlourmaids could fly to her post in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Susan,&rdquo; said Grace, when the door had closed  upon him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you have done a vastly clever thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow, I would rather have done it than left it undone!&rdquo;  her friend answered savagely, furious at Haldane&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth possessed you to bring that man and me  together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted you to meet. I know you like him, and I know  he worships you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worships! And he would scarcely hand me a cup of tea  &mdash; did it as if he were carrying food to a leper! Worship, forsooth! When it&rsquo;s evident  he believes the worst people say of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he takes the scandal more to heart than another  man would, because you have been his bright particular star.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I know he used to like coming to my house  &mdash; he used to jump at my invitations, I thought it was because I always had pretty  people about me, or that it was on account of my <i>chef</i>. But as for anything more  &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there was something more. He was deeply in love  with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not that kind of man. But he and I have been  pals ever since I came to London.  I taught a sister of his when his people lived in Onslow Square &mdash; a sister he adored. She married  a soldier, and died in India  a year after her marriage, and Arthur likes to talk to me about her. She was very  fond of me, poor girl. And then, last year, I found that he liked to talk about  you &mdash; and I know the inside of people&rsquo;s minds well enough to know most of the things  they don&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he cared for me last year why didn&rsquo;t he ask me to  marry him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he is, comparatively speaking, a poor man,  and you are rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense, Sue. If he cared for me &mdash; in that  way &mdash; he could never condemn me upon an idle rumour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You allow nothing for jealousy. He thought you were  encouraging Rannock, and that you meant to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had refused the wretch three times,&rdquo; said Grace,  despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the good of refusing him if you let him hang  about you &mdash; lunch at your house twice a week &mdash; dance attendance upon you at Ascot  and Henley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was foolish, I suppose. Everybody can tell  me so, now it is too late. Good-bye, Sue. Don&rsquo;t lay any more traps for me, please.  Your diplomacy doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry he behaved like a bear; but I am glad you  have met, in spite of his coldness. I know he loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that an ostracized person like me ought  to be grateful for any man&rsquo;s regard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Grace; but I think Arthur Haldane is just the one  man whose affection you value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never said as much to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no necessity. Don&rsquo;t be down-hearted, dear.  Things will right themselves sooner than you think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not down-hearted. I am only angry. Good-bye. Come  to lunch to-morrow if you want me to forgive you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be there. I believe I am more appreciative of  your <i>chef</i> than Arthur Haldane ever was.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a woman like a dewdrop, she&rsquo;s so purer than  the purest;<br>
  And her noble heart&rsquo;s the noblest, yes, and her sure faith&rsquo;s the surest:<br>
  And this woman says, &lsquo;My days were sunless and my nights were moonless,<br>
  Parched the pleasant April herbage, and the lark&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s outbreak tuneless,<br>
  If you loved me not!&rsquo; And I, who &mdash; (ah, for words of flame!) adore her!<br>
Who am mad to lay my spirit prostrate palpably before her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale&rsquo;s victoria was standing at Miss Rodney&rsquo;s  gate, but before she could step into it her path was intercepted by the last person  she expected to see at that moment, though he had so recently left her. It was Haldane,  who had been pacing the avenue in front of Miss Rodney&rsquo;s windows, and who crossed  the road hurriedly as Grace came out of the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you let your carriage wait while you walk with  me for a few minutes in the Park, Lady Perivale?&rdquo; he asked gravely. &ldquo;I have something  to say to you &mdash; that &mdash; that I want very much to say,&rdquo; he concluded feebly, the man  whose distinction of style the critics praised finding himself suddenly at a loss  for the commonest forms of speech.</p>
<p>Grace was too surprised to refuse. She gave a tacit  assent, and they crossed the road side by side, and went into the Park, by a turnstile  nearly opposite Miss Rodney&rsquo;s house. They walked along the quiet pathway between  two rows of limes that were just beginning to flower, and through whose leafy boughs  the evening light showed golden. They walked slowly, in a troubled silence, neither  of them venturing to look at the other, yet both of them feeling the charm of the  hour, and that more subtle charm of being in each other&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Perivale, when I left Miss Rodney&rsquo;s drawing-room  just now, my mind was so overwhelmed with trouble that I wanted to be alone &mdash; wanted  time to think. I have been pacing this pathway ever since, not long, perhaps, in  actual moments, but an age in thought, and &mdash; and &mdash; the end of it all is that, in  the most profound humility and self-contempt, I have to implore your pardon for  having suffered my thoughts to wrong you. My judgment has been to blame &mdash; not my  heart. That has never wavered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Haldane, was it worth while to apologize? You  have acted like all my other society friends &mdash; except one. People who have known  me ever since my marriage choose to believe that I have made myself unworthy of  their acquaintance. I cannot call it friendship, for no friend could believe the  story that has been told of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cut me to the heart. No friend, you say! And I  &mdash; I who have so honoured you in the past, I was fool enough to believe the slander  that was dinned into my ear, chapter and verse, with damning iteration. I struggled  against that belief &mdash; struggled and succumbed &mdash; because people were so sure of their  facts, and because &mdash; well, I confess, I believed the story. But I thought there  might have been a marriage &mdash; that for some reason of your own you wanted to keep  it dark. I could not think of you as other people thought, but I believed that you  were lost to me for ever. I had seen Rannock at your house, seen him about with  you &mdash; and &mdash; and I thought you cared for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were mistaken. I know now that I was foolish in  receiving him upon such a friendly footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only because the man is unworthy of any woman&rsquo;s confidence  or regard. Lady Perivale, I think last year you must have had some suspicion that  I was fighting a battle with my own heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be a better actor than I fancy myself if you  did not know that I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see no reason for fighting battles &mdash; if &mdash; if  that were so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you not? You don&rsquo;t know &mdash; or you did not know then  &mdash; how malevolent the world can be &mdash; this modern world, which measures everything  in life by its money value. You are rich, and I have just enough to live upon comfortably  without watching my bank-book. From the society point of view I am a pauper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would other people&rsquo;s opinion matter if I knew  you were sincere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is the question. That was why I kept silence.  My pride could not endure that you should rank me with such men as Rannock. And  there were others of the class pursuing you &mdash; ruined spendthrifts, to whom your  fortune would mean a new lease of profligate pleasures. I saw Rannock favoured by  you &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was never favoured. I liked his society because  he was unlike the rest of the world. I was sorry for him, for his disappointment,  his lost opportunities. I thought him a brokenhearted man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken-hearted? Yes, that is the reprobate&rsquo;s last card;  and unfortunately it often wins the game. Broken-hearted! &mdash; as if that battered  heart could break! A man who has lived only to do mischief, a man whose friendship  meant ruin for younger and better men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women know so little of men&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not such women as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess that he interested me. He seemed a creature  of whim and fancy, fluctuating between wild fun and deepest melancholy. I thought  no unkindly feeling when I refused to marry him, as other men had done whom I once  thought my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rannock looks longer ahead than other men. Be sure  he did not love you for your refusal, and that he hung on in the hope you would  change your mind. No man of that stamp was every a woman&rsquo;s friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk of him. I hate the sound of his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet you pronounced it so bravely just now in Miss Rodney&rsquo;s  drawing-room, and looked me in the face, as if you defied me to think ill of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was something like a challenge perhaps. And  did that convince you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> convinced me. I rushed from the house in a tumult  of wonder and doubt. But I had seen you, and could not go on doubting. Your eyes,  your voice, the pride in your glance, the pride of wounded innocence, defiant, yet  pathetic! Who that had seen you could go on doubting? Lady Perivale &mdash; Grace &mdash; can  you forgive a jealous fool who made his love for you a rod to scourge him, whose  thoughts have been cruel to you, but, God knows, how much more cruel to himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you are beginning to think better of me,&rdquo;  she answered quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning! I have not the shadow of a thought that  wrongs you. I am humbled in the dust under your feet. I ask for nothing but to be  forgiven, to be restored to your friendship, to help you as a friend, brother, father  might help you, in any difficulty, in any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; she said quietly, holding out her hand  to him; and their hands met in a firm and lingering grasp, which meant something  more than everyday friendliness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad you trust me, in the face of that odious  rumour,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I confess that I felt your unkindness &mdash; for it was unkind to  hold yourself aloof like other people whose friendship I had never particularly  valued. As to their preposterous story about me, it would be easy to answer it with  an <i>alibi</i>, since I was at my villa on the Italian Riviera from November to April,  and have not seen Colonel Rannock since the last Goodwood, when we were both in  Lady Carlaverock&rsquo;s house party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked up and down the little avenue of limes till  the golden light took a rosier glow and shone upon a lower level, and until Lady  Perivale&rsquo;s servants thought she had gone home in somebody else&rsquo;s carriage, and forgotten  that her own was waiting for her.</p>
<p>She told Haldane all that had happened to her since  her return to London &mdash; her indignation, her contempt for her false friends, Lady  Morningside&rsquo;s kindness, her engagement of Faunce, the detective, and her hope that  she would be able to refute the slander in a court of law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody in London  has seen my disgrace, and everybody in London  must know of my rehabilitation,&rdquo; she said; and then, in a contemptuous tone, &ldquo;Is  it not absurd that I must take all this trouble simply because another woman happens  to be like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And because a man happens to be a villain. I believe  the thing was a deep-laid scheme of Rannock&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he do such a vile thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he wanted to be even with you &mdash; that would  be his expression &mdash; for your refusing to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, surely no man could be capable of anything so diabolical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a good deal about Rannock&rsquo;s antecedents, and  I believe <i>he</i> could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, even if he were capable of such baseness, how  could he plan the thing so as to be met by people who know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was not difficult. He had only to watch the papers,  and throw himself in people&rsquo;s way. He knew that wherever he went there would be  travellers who knew you. He chose Algiers, Corsica,  Sardinia, as less public than Cannes  or Nice, and so affected an air of avoiding the rush of tourists. God forgive me,  if I wrong the man &mdash; I hate him too much to reason fairly about him, but the fact  of his absence from London  this season counts against him. It looks as if, having fired his shot, he kept himself  clear of the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody would have cut him if he had been in London!&rdquo; Lady Perivale said  scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than usual. He was not liked &mdash; by the best  people!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! But he was so clever, so amusing, played the &rsquo;cello  divinely &mdash; and he flattered me by telling me his troubles, and how hardly the world  had used him. I thought him a victim. Oh, what an idiot I have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. You have only been not quite a woman of the  world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought I was one. I thought I had learnt everything  in my half-dozen years of society, and that the pristine simplicity of my father&rsquo;s  parsonage was a thing of the past. And I suffered myself to be talked about, my  name bandied about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the privilege of your friendship till you think  me worthy of a dearer bond, and I will protect you from all the errors of unworldliness.  I would not have you one jot more of a worldling than you are. I have worldly wisdom  enough for both of us &mdash; the wisdom of Mayfair and Belgravia,  which the angels call folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her to her carriage, but he did not ask to be  allowed to call upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be leaving town shortly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I hope  we may meet in the autumn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going abroad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so, but I have not determined the direction.  I will write to you from &mdash; wherever I am &mdash; if you will allow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be pleased to hear from you,&rdquo; she answered  gently &ldquo;I am very glad we are friends again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this they clasped hands and parted, lovers half avowed.</p>
<p>Grace went home radiant. She had always liked him. It  might be that she had always loved him. His coldness had cut her to the heart, yet  now that he was at her feet again, she respected him for having held himself aloof  while there was a shadow of doubt in his mind. The fortune-hunter would have taken  advantage of her isolation, and pursued her all the more ardently while she was  under a cloud. And she was touched by his surrendering at once to her personal influence,  to the eyes and voice that he loved. He could not meet her face to face, and go  on doubting her.</p>

<p>Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s profession, more especially since he left  Scotland Yard, had lain for the most part among the upper classes. He had been employed  in delicate investigations that had brought him in touch with some of the mightiest  in the land, and he knew his peerage almost as well as if his own name had been  recorded in that golden book. His aristocratic clients found him as kindly and sympathetic  as he was shrewd and trustworthy. He never made the galled jade wince by a tactless  allusion. He always took an indulgent view of the darkest case when he discussed  it with the delinquent&rsquo;s family. He could turn a father&rsquo;s wrath to pity by his shrewd  excuses for a son&rsquo;s misconduct, making forgery appear only a youthful ebullition,  proceeding rather from want of thought than want of honesty. But he was always on  the side of the angels, and always urged generous dealing when a woman was in question.  If wrongs had to be righted, a breach of promise case quashed, Faunce was always  the victim&rsquo;s advocate. His tactfulness soothed the offended parent&rsquo;s pride, the  betrayed husband&rsquo;s self-respect, People liked him and trusted him; and the family  skeleton was brought out of the cupboard, and submitted freely to his inspection.</p>
<p>He knew a good deal of the lives of men about town;  and among the baser specimens of this trivial race he knew Richard Rannock, late  of the Lanarkshire Regiment. When he left Grosvenor Square, with Lady Perivale&rsquo;s case  neatly engraved upon the tablet of his brain, needing no shorthand note to assist  his memory, he was prepared to find that the slander from which the lady suffered  had been brought about by some deliberate perfidy on the part of her rejected suitor.  He knew of cruel things, and dastardly things, that Rannock had done in the course  of his chequered career, mostly in the relation of hawk to pigeon; he knew the man&rsquo;s  financial affairs to have been desperate for the last ten years; and that although  he had contrived to live among young men of means and position, with the reputation  of being an open hearted, wild kind of fellow, he had lived like the buzzard and  the kite, and the cruel eye had been ever on the watch, and the hungry beak ever  ready to pounce upon the unsuspecting quarry.</p>
<p>Faunce&rsquo;s first business was to find the woman. When  he had marked her down, he would turn his attention to the man. He was in Algiers  as soon as train and boat could take him there, and being as much at his ease in  Africa as at Charing Cross, sauntered slowly under the meridian sun along the dazzling  street from the steamer to the hotel, chose his room amidst the echoing emptiness  of the corridors, where the hum of the mosquito was the only sound, made his expeditious  toilet, and, with clean-shaved chin spotless shirt, and well-brushed alpaca coat,  lounged into the French manager&rsquo;s bureau.</p>
<p>The manager knew Mr. Faunce, who had spent a week at  the hotel during the previous autumn, in the interests of a wronged husband, high-born  had danced away from the marital mansion with a favourite partner, as gaily as if  an elopement were only a new figure in the cotillon. Faunce had run the poor little  lady to earth in this very hotel, hidden in an armoire, among perfumed silk petticoats  and lace flounces. He had found her, and had taken her straight home to her husband,  tearful and ashamed, but only guilty of such a girlish escapade as husbands can  forgive.</p>
<p>She had parted with her lover at Marseilles. He was to cross in a different steamer,  to throw pursuers off the scent. And his steamer had been delayed, and she was alone  at the hotel in Algiers,  frightened out of her wits, when Faunce retrieved her.</p>
<p>The manager was delighted to see the English detective,  offered his cigar-case, proposed drinks. Faunce never refused a cigar, and rarely  accepted a drink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Merci, mon ami</i>, I had breakfast on the steamer half  an hour ago,&rdquo; and then Faunce unfolded his business.</p>
<p>He affected no secrecy with M. Louis, the manager, who  was <i>bon zig</i>, and the essence of discretion.</p>
<p>Such and such a man &mdash; here followed a graphic description  of Colonel Rannock &mdash; had been at the hotel in the last tourist season &mdash; date unknown.  It might have been before Christmas, or it might have been any time before April.  He had come from Sardinia or Corsica, or he was  going to one of those islands. He had a lady with him, young and handsome, and he  was supposed to be travelling under an alias, and not under his own name &mdash; Rannock.</p>
<p>The manager looked puzzled. The most minute description  will hardly conjure up the distinct image of one particular man. There are generally  a dozen men in any prosperous hotel who would fit Faunce&rsquo;s description of Colonel  Rannock &mdash; tall, dark, an aquiline nose, a heavy moustache, eyes rather too near  together, forehead prominent over the eyes, receding sharply above the perceptive  ridge, hands and feet small, air thoroughbred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Que diable</i>,&rdquo; said the manager,&rdquo;we had a very good season.  <i>Les messieurs de cette esp&egrave;ce fourmillaient dans l&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</i>. I could count one such  on every finger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you count ten such women as that?&rdquo; asked Faunce,  taking Lady Perivale&rsquo;s photograph from his letter-case and laying it on the manager&rsquo;s  desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sapristi!</i>&rdquo; said M. Louis, looking at Lady Perivale&rsquo;s  photograph. &ldquo;Yes, I remember her. <i>Elle &eacute;tait une dr&ocirc;lesse</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Faunce&rsquo;s mind had harboured any lingering doubt of  Lady Perivale&rsquo;s innocence, that phrase would have dispelled it. In no circumstances  could the woman he had seen in Grosvenor    Square have so conducted herself as to merit such a  description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at it a little closer,&rdquo; said Faunce, &ldquo;and tell  me <i>pour s&ucirc;r</i> that you know the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t know her. Your photograph is uncommonly  like her, but not the very woman &mdash; unless it was taken some years, ago. This lady  is younger than the woman who was here last February, by at least half a dozen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The photograph was taken recently, as you can see by  the dress,&rdquo; said Faunce; &ldquo;and now tell me about the woman who was here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are looking for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgery, or&rdquo; &mdash; and the manager&rsquo;s eyes opened wider,  and his nostrils quivered with excitement&mdash;&ldquo;murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither. I want the lady in the witness-box, not in  the dock. Her evidence is required in the interests of a client of mine, and I am  prepared to pay handsomely for any information that will help me to find her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Faunce has always the good sense. Well, what  do you want to know about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything that you or any of your <i>personnel</i> can tell  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was here for a little over a fortnight, with her  husband &mdash; now that I think of him, just the man you describe &mdash; tall, dark, hook-nose,  prominent brow, eyes near together, heavy moustache, drank a good deal, chiefly  Cognac, the lady preferred champagne; spent every night at the club, seldom came  home till the hotel was shut; the night porter would tell you his hours; quarrelled  with the lady, tried to beat her, and got the worst of it; came to the <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i>  with a black eye and a scratched cheek. My faith, but they were a pretty couple!  They would have made a pretty scandal if they had stayed much longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he able to pay his bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes; he would always be able. There were two young  Americans &mdash; what is it you others call your <i>richards? Les oiseaux d&rsquo;ouf</i>. They went  to the club with him every night, they played piquet in his salon of an afternoon,  they brought flowers and gloves and chocolates for the lady. The poor children!  How they were played! And there was a diamond merchant from the Transvaal. He, too, admired Madame, and he, too, played piquet  in the salon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Madame; was she very civil to these gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Civil? She treated them like the dirt under her feet.  She laughed at them to their noses. <i>Elle faisait ses farces sur tout le monde</i>. Ah!  but she had a droll of tongue. <i>Quel esprit, quelle blague, quel chic!</i> But it was  a festival to listen to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she the air of a woman who had been a lady, and  who had <i>d&eacute;gringol&eacute;?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pas le moins du monde</i>. She was <i>franchement canaille.  Elle n&rsquo;avait pas d&eacute;gringol&eacute;</i>. She had rather risen in the world. Some little <i>grisette</i>,  perhaps; some little rat of the Opera &mdash; but <i>jolie &agrave; croquer</i> &mdash; tall, proud, with  an air of queen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You often had a chat with her, I dare say, Monsieur  Louis, as she went in and out of the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais, oui</i>. She would come into the bureau, to ask questions,  to order a carriage, and would stop to put on her gloves &mdash; she had no <i>femme de chambre</i>  &mdash; and though her clothes were handsome, she was a slovenly dresser, and wore the  same gown every day, which is not the mark of a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In these casual conversations did you find out who  she is, where she lives, in London  or elsewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From her conversation I would say she lives nowhere  &mdash; a nomad, drifting about the world, drinking her bottle of champagne with her dinner,  crunching pralines all the afternoon, smoking nine or ten cigarettes after every meal, and costing<i> pas mal d&rsquo;argent</i> to the person  who has to pay for her caprices. She talked of London,  she talked of Rome, of Vienna  &mdash; she knows every theatre and restaurant in Paris, but not half a dozen sentences of French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A free lance,&rdquo; said Faunce. &ldquo;Now for the name of this  lady and gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The name had escaped Monsieur Louis. He had to find  the page in his ledger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Randall, numbers 11 and 12, first floor,  from February 7th to February 25th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randall! The name that Miss Rodney&rsquo;s Duchess had told  her, and which Lady Perivale had told Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lady&rsquo;s Christian name? Can you remember that?  You must have heard her pseudo-husband call her by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louis tapped his forehead smartly, as if he were knocking  at the door of memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Tiens, tiens, tiens!</i> I heard it often &mdash; it was some  term of endearment. <i>Tiens!</i> It was Pig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig! &mdash; Pigs are for good luck. I wonder what kind of  luck this one will bring Colonel &mdash; Randall. And what did she call him? Another  term of endearment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She called him sometimes Dick, but the most often Ranny.  When they were good friends, <i>bien entendu</i>. There were days when she would not address  him the word. <i>Elle savait comment se faire valoir!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They generally do know that, when they spring from  the gutter,&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>He had learnt a good deal. Such a woman &mdash; with such  beauty, dash, devilry &mdash; ought to be traceable in London,  Paris, or New    York, anywhere. He told himself that it might take him  a long time to find her &mdash; or time that would be long for him, an adept in rapid  action &mdash; but he felt very sure that he could find her, and that when he found her  he could mould her to his will.</p>
<p>There was only one thing, Faunce thought, that would  make her difficult &mdash; a genuine attachment to Rannock. If she really loved him, as  such women can love, it might be hard work to induce her to betray him, even though  no fatal consequences to him hung upon her secrecy. He knew the dogged fidelity  which worthless women sometimes give to worthless men.</p>
<p>The hotel was almost empty, so after a prolonged siesta,  Mr. Faunce dined with the manager in the restaurant, which they had to themselves,  while half a dozen tourists made a disconsolate little group in the desolation of  the spacious dining-room.</p>
<p>Faunce did not pursue the subject of the Randalls and  their behaviour during the social meal, for he knew that the manager&rsquo;s mind having  been set going in that direction he would talk about them of his own accord, a surmise  which proved correct, for M. Louis talked of nothing else; but there were no vital  facts elicited over the bottle of Pommery which Mr. Faunce ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady was something of a slattern, you say?&rdquo; said  Faunce. &ldquo;In that case she would be likely to leave things &mdash; odd gloves, old letters,  trinkets &mdash; behind her. Now, in my work things are often of the last importance.  Trifles light as air, mon ami, are sign-posts and guiding stars for the detective.  You may remember Muller&rsquo;s hat &mdash; his murdered victim&rsquo;s, with the crown cut down &mdash;  thriftiness that cost the German youth dear. I could recall innumerable instances.  Now, did not this lady leave some trifling trail, some litter of gloves, fans, letters,  which your gallantry would treasure as a <i>souvenir?</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you come to that, her room was a pigsty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To correspond with her pet name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the hotel was full, and I set the chambermaids  at work ten minutes after the Randalls drove to the boat. We had people coming into  the rooms that afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you had neither leisure nor curiosity to seek for  relics of the lovely creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Louis shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my room on the same floor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Mais oui</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have the same chambermaid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. She is the oldest servant we have, and she stays  in the hotel all the summer; while most of our staff are in Switzerland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was enough for Faunce. He retired to his room early, after smoking a couple of cigarettes under  the palm trees in front of the hotel, in the sultry hush of the summer night. The  scene around him was all very modern, all very French &mdash; a <i>caf&eacute;</i>-concert on the right,  a <i>caf&eacute;</i>-concert on the left &mdash; and it needed an occasional Arab stalking by in a long  white mantle to remind him that he was in Africa.  He meant to start on his return journey to London by the next boat. He was not going to Corsica  or Sardinia in search of new facts. He trusted  to his professional acumen to run the lady to ground in London  or Paris.</p>
<p>He shut the window against insect life, lighted his  candles, and seated himself at the table, with his writing-case open before him,  and then rang the dual summons which brings the hotel chambermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to get me some ink,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The chambermaid, who was elderly and sourvisaged, told  him that ink was the waiter&rsquo;s business, not hers. He should have rung once, not  twice, for ink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the ink, Marie,&rdquo; he said, in French. &ldquo;I  want something more valuable even than ink. I want information, and I think you  can give it to me. Do you remember Monsieur and Madame Randall, who had rooms on  this floor before Easter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, she remembered them; but what then?</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Madame Randall left she was in a hurry, was she  not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was always in a hurry when she had to go anywhere  &mdash; unless she was sulky and would not budge. She would sit like a stone figure if  she had one of her tempers,&rdquo; the chambermaid answered, with many contemptuous shrugs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left hurriedly, and she left her room in a litter  &mdash; left all sorts of things behind her?&rdquo; suggested Faunce, with an insinuating smile.</p>
<p>The chambermaid&rsquo;s sharp black eyes flashed angrily,  and the chambermaid tossed her head in scorn. And then she held out a skinny forefinger  almost under Faunce&rsquo;s nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not left so much as that,&rdquo; she said, striking  the finger on the first joint with the corresponding finger of the other hand. &ldquo;Not  so much as that!&rdquo; and from her vehemence Faunce suspected that she had reaped a  harvest of small wares, soiled gloves and lace-bordered handkerchiefs, silk stockings  with ravelled heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a pity,&rdquo; he said in his quietest voice, &ldquo;for I  should have been glad to have given you a couple of napoleons for any old letters  or other documents that you might have found among the rubbish when you swept the  rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For letters, they were all in the fireplace, torn to  shreds,&rdquo; said the chambermaid; &ldquo;but there was something &mdash; something that I picked  up, and kept, in case the lady should come back, when I could return it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always something,&rdquo; said Faunce. &ldquo;Well, Marie,  what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A photograph&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur, of a young man &mdash; <i>pas grand&rsquo; chose</i>. But  if Monsieur values the portrait at forty francs it is at his disposition, and I  will hazard the anger of Madame should she return and ask me for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Pas de danger!</i> She will not return. She belongs to  the wandering tribes, the people who never come back. Since the portrait is not  of the lady herself, and may be worth nothing to me, we will say twenty francs,  <i>ma belle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chambermaid was inclined to haggle, but when Faunce  shrugged his shoulders, laid a twenty-franc piece upon the table, and declined further  argument, she pocketed the coin, and went to fetch the photograph.</p>
<p>It was the least possible thing in the way of portraits,  of the kind called &ldquo;midget,&rdquo; a fulllength portrait of a young man, faded and dirty,  in a little morocco case that had once been red, but was soiled to blackness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; muttered Faunce, &ldquo;I ought to know that face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told himself that he ought to know it, for it was  a familiar face, a face that spoke to him out of the long ago; but he could not  place it in the record of his professional experiences. He took the photo out of  the case, and looked at the back, where he found what he expected. There is always  something written upon that kind of photograph by that kind of woman.</p>
<p class="note"><i>&ldquo;San Remo,</i><br>
  <i>&ldquo;Poor old Tony. November </i>22<i>th,</i> &rsquo;88<i>.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>The 22th, the uneducated penmanship sprawling over the  little card, alike indicated the style of the writer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Tony!&rdquo; mused Faunce, slowly puffing his last  cigarette, with the midget stuck up in front of him, between the two candles. &ldquo;Who  is Tony? A swell, by the cut of his clothes, and that &mdash; well, the good-bred ones  have an air of their own, an air that one can no more deny than one can describe  it. Poor old Tony! At San Remo  &mdash; condemned by the doctors. There&rsquo;s death in every line of the face and figure.  A consumptive, most likely. The last sentence has been passed on you, poor beggar!  Poor old Tony! And that woman was with you at San Remo, the companion of a doomed man, dying  by inches. And she must have been in the flower of her beauty then, a splendid creature.  Was she very fond of you, I wonder, honestly, sincerely attached to you? I think  she was, for her hand trembled when she wrote those words! Poor old Tony! And there  is a smudge across the date, that might indicate a tear. Well, if I fail in running  her to earth in London, I could trace some part of  her past life at San Remo,  and get at her that way. But who was Tony? I&rsquo;m positive I know the face. Perhaps  the reflex action of the brain will help me,&rdquo; concluded Faunce.</p>
<p>The reflex action did nothing for Mr. Faunce, in the  profound slumber which followed upon the fatigue of a long journey. No suggestion  as to the original of the photograph had occurred to him when he put it in his letter-case  next morning. It was hours afterwards, when he was lying in his berth in the steamer,  &ldquo;rocked in the cradle of the deep,&rdquo; wakeful, but with his brain in an idle, unoccupied  state, that Tony&rsquo;s identity flashed upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Hubert Withernsea,&rdquo; he said to himself, sitting  up in his berth, and clapping his hand upon his forehead. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man! I remember  him about town ten years ago &mdash; a Yorkshire baronet with large estates in the West  Riding &mdash; a weak-kneed youth with a passion for the Fancy, always heard of at prize-fights,  and entertaining fighting men, putting up money for private glove-fights; a poor  creature, born to be the prey of swindlers and loose women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce looked back to that period of ten years ago,  which seemed strangely remote, more by reason of the changes in ideas and fashions,  whim and folly, than by the lapse of time. He searched his mind for the name of  any one woman in particular with whom Sir Hubert Withernsea had been associated,  but here memory failed him. He had never had business relations with the young man,  and though his ears were always open to the gossip of the town, he kept no record  of trivial things outside the affairs of his clients. One young fool more or less  travelling along the primrose path made no impression upon him. But with the knowledge  of this former episode in the pseudo-Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s career, it ought to be easy  for him to find out all about her in London,  that focus of the world&rsquo;s intelligence, where he almost invariably searched for  information before drawing any foreign capital.</p>

<p>Faunce wrote to Lady Perivale on his arrival in town,  and told her the result of his journey briefly, and without detail. She might make  her mind easy. The woman who resembled her would be found. He was on her track,  and success was only a question of time.</p>
<p>Grace read the letter to Susan Rodney, who was dining  with her that evening. She had been in much better spirits of late, and Sue rejoiced  in the change, but did not suspect the cause. She had gone to her own den at the  back of her house when Grace left her, and had not seen the carriage standing by  the park gate, nor had the interview in the park come to her knowledge. Her friend,  who confided most things to her, was reticent here. She attributed Lady Perivale&rsquo;s  cheerfulness to a blind faith in Faunce the detective.</p>
<p>The season was drawing towards its close. Lady Morningside&rsquo;s  white ball had been a success, all the prettiest people looking their prettiest  in white frocks, and the banks of gloxinias in the hall and staircase and supper-rooms  being a thing to rave about. The London  season was waning. The Homburg people and the Marienbad people were going or gone.  The yachting people were rushing about buying stores, or smart clothes for Cowes. The shooting people  were beginning to talk about their grouse moors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sue, we must positively go somewhere,&rdquo; Grace said.  &ldquo;Even you must be able to take a holiday within an hour of London; and you may be sure I shan&rsquo;t go far while  I have this business on hand. You will come with me, won&rsquo;t you, Sue? I am beginning  to sicken of solitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall love to come, if you are near enough for me  to run up to town once or twice a week. I have three or four pig-headed pupils who  won&rsquo;t go away when I want them; but most of my suburbans are packing their golf  clubs for Sandwich, Cromer, or North Berwick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will come! That&rsquo;s capital! I shall take a house  on the river between Windsor and Goring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it as near London as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are good it shall be below Windsor, even if the river  is not so pretty there as it is at Wargrave or Taplow. I want to be near London, for Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s convenience.  I hope he will have news to bring me. I wrote to beg him to call to-morrow morning  &mdash; I want to know what discoveries he made in Algiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People who have twenty thousand a year, more or less,  seldom have to wait for things. Lady Perivale drove to a fashionable agent in Mount  Street next morning, and stated her wishes; and the appearance of her victoria and  servants, and the fact that she made no mention of price, indicated that she was  a client worth having. The agent knew of a charming house on a lovely reach of the  river near Runnymede &mdash; gardens perfection, stables  admirable, boathouse spacious, and well provided with boats at the tenant&rsquo;s disposal.  Unluckily, he had let it the day before; but he hoped that little difficulty might  be got over. He would offer his client a villa further up the river. He would write  to Lady Perivale next morning.</p>
<p>The little difficulty was got over. The client, actual  or fictitious, was mollified, and Lady Perivale took the house for a month at two  hundred guineas, on the strength of a water-colour sketch. She sent some of her  servants to prepare for her coming, and she and Susan Rodney were installed there  at the end of the week.</p>
<p>The house and gardens were almost as pretty as they  looked in water-colour, though the river was not quite so blue, and the roses were  not quite so much like summer cabbages as the artist had made them. There were a  punt and a couple of good skiffs in the boat-house; and Lady Perivale and her friend,  who could both row, spent half their days on the river, where Grace met some of  those quondam friends whom she had passed so often in the park; met and passed them  with unalterable disdain, though sometimes she thought she saw a little look of  regret, an almost appealing expression in their faces, as if they were beginning  to think they might have been too hasty in their conclusions about her.</p>
<p>One friend she met on the river whom she did not pretend  to scorn. On the second Saturday afternoon a skiff flashed past her through the  July sunshine, and her eyes were quick to recognize the rower. It was Arthur Haldane.  She gave an involuntary cry or surprise, and he turned his light craft, and brought  it beside the roomy boat in which she and Sue were sitting, with books and work,  and the <i>marron</i> poodle, as in a floating parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you staying near here, Lady Perivale?&rdquo; he asked,  when greetings had been exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are living close by, Miss Rodney and I, at Runnymede  Grange. I hope you won&rsquo;t laugh at our rowing. Our idea of a boat is only a movable  summer-house. We dawdle up and down for an hour or two, and then creep into a backwater,  and talk, and work, and read, all the afternoon, and one of the servants comes to  us at five o&rsquo;clock, and makes tea on the bank with a gipsy kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might ask him to one of our gipsy teas, Grace,&rdquo;  suggested Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure. Will you come this afternoon? We shall  be in the little creek &mdash; the first you come to after passing Runnymede Grange, which  you will know by the Italian terrace and sundial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come and help your footman to boil the kettle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked radiant. He had seen Lady Perivale&rsquo;s happy  look when his boat neared hers, and his heart danced for joy. All the restraint  he had set upon himself was flung to the winds. If she loved him, what did anything  matter? It was not the world&rsquo;s mistrust he dreaded, or the world&rsquo;s contempt. His  only fear had been that she should doubt him, misread his motives, rank him with  the fortune-hunters who had pursued her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you staying near here?&rdquo; asked Susan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come up the river for a day or two now and then.  There is a cottage at Staines kept by a nice old  spinster, whose rooms are the pink of cleanliness, and who can cook a mutton chop.  I keep a quire or two of foolscap in her garden parlour, and go there sometimes  to do my work. Her garden goes down to the water, and there is a roomy arbour of  hops that I share with the caterpillars, a kind of <i>berceau</i>, from which I can see  the river and the boats going by, through the leafy screen, while nobody can see  me. It is the quietest place I know of near London. The rackety people seldom come below Maidenhead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spent the hours between tea-time and sunset with  Grace and her friend, in a summer idleness, while the poodle, who found himself  receiving less attention from his mistress than usual, roamed up and down, scratching  holes in the bank, and pretending to hunt rats among the sedges, evidently oppressed  with ennui. Of those three friends there were two who knew not the lapse of time,  and were surprised to see the great golden disc sink below the rosy water where  the river curved westward, and the sombre shadows steal over keep and battlements  yonder where the Royal fortress barred the evening sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How short the days are getting,&rdquo; Grace said naively.</p>
<p>They two had found so much to talk about after having  lived a year without meeting. All the books they had read, all the plays they had  seen, the music they had heard &mdash; everything made a subject for discussion; and then  it was so sweet to be there, in the full confidence of friendship, spell-bound in  a present happiness, and in vague dreams of the future, sure that nothing could  ever again come between them and their trust in each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days are shortening by a cock&rsquo;s step or so,&rdquo; said  Sue, looking up from an afternoon tea-cloth, which she was decorating with an elaborate  design in silk and gold thread, and which she had been seen engaged upon for the  last ten years.</p>
<p>It was known as &ldquo;Sue&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; It went everywhere with  her, and was criticized and admired everywhere, and everybody knew that it would  never be finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The days are shortening, no doubt,&rdquo; repeated Sue;  &ldquo;they must begin, or we should never get to the long winter evening&rsquo;s, but I haven&rsquo;t  perceived any difference yet, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything odd in the sun  going down at eight o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight o&rsquo;clock! Nonsense, Sue!&rdquo; cried Lady Perivale,  flinging down a volume of &ldquo;The Ring and the Book,&rdquo; which she had been nursing all  the afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as we are supposed to dine at eight, I think we  ought to go home and put on our tea-gowns,&rdquo; pursued Sue, sedately.</p>
<p>Can there be such happiness in life; bliss that annihilates  thought and time? Grace blushed crimson, ashamed of having been so happy.</p>
<p>Mr. Haldane bade them good night at the bottom of the  garden steps, where his outrigger was waiting for him. It would have been so easy  to ask him to dinner, so easy to keep him till midnight, so easy to prolong the  sweetness of golden hours. But Grace was discreet. They were not lovers, only friends.  She wanted to spin to its finest thread this season of sweet uncertainty, these  exquisite hours on the threshold of Paradise. And  then Sue might think him a bore. Sue was not overfond of masculine society. She  liked to put her feet on a chair after dinner, and she sometimes liked a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never smoke before men&rdquo; she told Grace. &ldquo;They think  we do it to please, ofsr to shock them.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;True as steel, boys!<br>
That knows all chases, and can watch all hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the course of that summer afternoon&rsquo;s talk with Grace  Perivale, Arthur Haldane had explained the change in his plans since their meeting  in Regent&rsquo;s Park.</p>
<p>The business which would have taken him away from England for some  time had hung fire, and his journey was postponed indefinitely. He did not tell  her that his contemplated journey was solely in her interests, that he had thought  of going to America in quest of Colonel Rannock, with the idea that he, the man  with whose name Lady Perivale&rsquo;s had been associated, should himself set her right  before that little world which had condemned her. He knew not by what machinery  that rehabilitation could be accomplished; but his first impulse was to find the  man whose acquaintance had brought this trouble upon her.</p>
<p>Two days after that golden sunset in which he and Lady  Perivale had parted, with clasped hands that vowed life-long fidelity, while yet  no word had been spoken, Mr. Haldane called upon John Faunce at his <i>pied &agrave; terre</i>  in Essex Street.</p>
<p>He had written for an appointment on business connected  with Lady Perivale&rsquo;s case, and Faunce had replied asking him to call at his rooms  in Essex Street  at ten o&rsquo;clock next morning. An early hour, which denoted the man whose every hour  was valuable.</p>
<p>He found the house one of the oldest in the old-world  street, next door to a nest of prosperous solicitors, but itself of a somewhat shabby  and retiring aspect. The bell was answered by a bright-eyed servant girl, clean  and fresh looking, but with an accent that suggested the Irish Town Limerick, rather  than a London slum  &mdash; a much pleasanter accent to Haldane&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>To the inquiry if Mr. Faunce lived there, she answered  with a note of interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wh-hat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Faunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he does. Any message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;ll go and see. Wh-hat name? </p>
<p>A quick-eyed scrutiny of the visitor&rsquo;s spotless holland  waistcoat, the neat dark stripes of the straight-knee&rsquo;d trousers falling in a graceful  curve over the irreproachable boots, and the sheen of a silk-faced coat, had assured  her of his respectability before she committed herself even so far as that.</p>
<p>But when this well-groomed gentleman, who was far too  quietly dressed to be a member of the swell-mob, produced an immaculate card out  of a silver case, she grasped it and dashed up the steep stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I tell &rsquo;um you want to see &rsquo;um?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall!&rdquo; and she vanished round the first landing.</p>
<p>She was back again and leaning over the same spot on  the bannister rail in half a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re to be good enough to step up, if ye plaze, surr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Faunce occupied the second floor, front and back,  as sitting-room and bedroom; the busy nature and uncertain hours of his avocations  during the last few years having made his rural retreat at Putney impossible for  him except in the chance intervals of his serious work, or from Friday to Monday,  when that work was slack. It was not that he loved wife and home less, but that  he loved duty more.</p>
<p>He emerged from the bedroom as Haldane entered the sitting-room,  in the act of fixing a collar to his grey flannel shirt, and welcomed his visitor  cordially, with apologies for not being dressed. He had been late overnight, and  had been slower than usual at his toilet, as he was suffering from a touch of rheumatism.  His profession was betrayed by a pair of regulation highwaisted trousers of a thick  blue-black material, over Blucher boots, which were also made to the sealed pattern  of the Force. But his costume was rounded off by a pepper-and-salt Norfolk jacket  of workman-like cut.</p>
<p>There was no paltry pride about Mr. Faunce. Although  a man of respectable parentage, good parts, and education, he was not in the least ashamed of having been for many years a respected  member of the Police. In ordinary life he somewhat affected the get-up of a country  parson with a retired police-officer.</p>
<p>His rheumatism had taken him in the arm, he explained,  or he would have been at his table there writing up one of his cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is often as much in one of &rsquo;em as would make  a three-volume novel, Mr. Haldane;&rdquo; and then, with a polite wave of the hand&mdash;&ldquo;in  bulk,&rdquo; he added, disclaiming all literary pretentions, and at the same time motioning  his guest to a chair.</p>
<p>This laborious penwork was perhaps the most remarkable  feature in John Faunce&rsquo;s career. The hours of patient labour this supremely patient  man employed in noting down every detail and every word concerning the case in hand,  which may have come to the notice of himself or any of his numerous temporary assistants,  in and out of the police-force, stamped him as the detective who is born, not made,  or, in other words, the worker who loves his work.</p>
<p>The room reflected the man&rsquo;s mind. It was a perfectly  arranged receptacle of a wonderful amount of precise information. It was like the  sitting-room of an exceptionally methodical student preparing for a very stiff examination.  The neat dwarf bookcase contained a goodly number of standard books of reference,  and a lesser number of the most famous examples of modern fiction.</p>
<p>One corner of the room was occupied by a stack of japanned  tin boxes that recalled a solicitor&rsquo;s office; but these boxes had no lettering upon  them. A discreet little numeral was sufficient indication of their contents for  Faunce, who was incapable of forgetting a fact once registered in the book of his  mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must find papers accumulate rapidly in your work,  Mr. Fauncc,&rdquo; said Haldane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would if I let them, sir; but I don&rsquo;t. When once  a case is settled or withdrawn from my hands, I return all letters and other papers  that may have reached me, and I burn my history of the case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have nothing left for your Reminiscences,  then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are here, sir,&rdquo; the detective replied sharply,  tapping his massive brow; &ldquo;and one day &mdash; well, sir, one day I may let the reading  world know that truth is stranger &mdash; and sometimes even more thrilling &mdash; than fiction.  But I must have consummate cheek to talk of fiction to the author of&rsquo; &lsquo;Mary Deane.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haldane started, half inclined to resent an impertinance; but a blance at the man&rsquo;s fine head and  brilliant eye reminded him that the detective and the novelist might be on thesame intellectual plane, or that in sheer brain  power the man from Scotland Yard might be his superior.</p>
<p>Faunce had seen the look, and smiled his quiet smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the penalties of being famous, Mr. Haldane,  that your inferiors may venture to admire you. I have your book among my favourites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the shelf, where Haldane saw the modest,  dark-green cloth back of his one novel, between &ldquo;Esmond&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Woman in White.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now to business, sir. And first allow me to say  that I am glad to see any friend of Lady Perivale&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Faunce. You must not suppose that Lady  Perivale sent me here. She did not even know that I wanted to see you; and I must  ask you not to mention my visit. I heard of what you were doing from a friend of  Lady Perivale&rsquo;s, not from herself, and I am here to consult you on a matter that  only indirectly affects her case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I am at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be perfectly frank with you, Mr. Faunce. I  believe a gentleman of your profession may be considered a kind of father confessor,  that anything I say in this office will be &mdash; strictly Masonic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I may tell you in the first place that  Lady Perivale is the woman whom I admire and respect above all other women, and  that it is my highest ambition to win her for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that is a very natural ambition, sir, in any  gentleman who&mdash;being free to choose&mdash;has the honour to know that lady,&rdquo; Faunce replied,  with a touch of enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know something of Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s antecedents,  and have met him in society, though he was never a friend of mine; and when I heard  the scandal about Lady Perivale, it occurred to me that the best thing I could do,  in her interest, was to find Rannock and call upon him to clear her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A difficult thing for him to do, sir, even if he were  willing to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the way might be found, if the man were made  to feel that it must be found. I have the worst possible opinion of Colonel Rannock;  but a man of that character has generally a weak joint in his harness, and I thought  I should be able to bring him to book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very tough customer, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir. A human armadillo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first matter was to find him. He was said to be  in the Rocky Mountains, and I was prepared to go  there after him; only such an expedition seemed improbable at the time of year.  I had heard of him in chambers in the Albany; but on inquiry there I found he gave  up his chambers last March, sold lease and furniture, and that his present address,  if he had one in London, was unknown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I take it, sir, not having my professional experience,  you were baffled, and went no further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I wasn&rsquo;t beaten quite so easily. I think, Faunce,  your profession has a certain fascination for every man. It is the hunter&rsquo;s instinct,  common to mankind, from the Stone Age downwards. After a good deal of trouble I  found Rannock&rsquo;s late body-servant, a shrewd fellow, now billiard-marker at the Sans-Souci  Club; and from him I heard that Rannock&rsquo;s destination was not the Rockies, but Klondyke.  He left London for New York  by the American Line at the end of March, taking the money he got for his lease  and furniture and he was to join two other men&mdash;whose mames their servants gave me&mdash;at San Francisco, on their way to Vancouver. He was to write  to his servant about certain confidential matters as soon as he arrived in New York, and was to send  him money if he prospered in his gold-digging, for certain special payments, and  for wages in arrear. I had no interest in knowing more of these transactions than  the man chose to tell me; but the one salient fact is that no communication of any  kind has reached the servant since his master left his account. He has written to  an agent in San Francisco,  whose address Rannock had given him, and the agent replied that no such person as  Colonel Rannock had been at his office or had communicated with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, Colonel Rannock changed his mind at the  eleventh hour; or he had a reason for pretending to go to one place and going to  another,&rdquo; said Faunce, quietly, looking up from a writing-pad on which he had made  two or three pencil-notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That might be so. I cabled an inquiry to the agent,  whose letter to the valet was six weeks old, and I asked the whereabouts of the  two friends whose party Rannock was to join. The reply came this morning. No news  of Rannock; the other men started for Vancouver  on April 13th.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want me to pursue this inquiry further, Mr.  Haldane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I want to find Rannock. It may be a foolish idea  on my part. But Lady Perivale has been cruelly injured by the association of her  name with this man &mdash; possibly by no fault of his &mdash; possibly by some devilish device  to punish her for having slighted him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That hardly seems likely. They may have done such things  in the last century, sir, when duelling was in fashion, and when a fine gentleman  thought it no disgrace to wager a thousand pounds against a lady&rsquo;s honour, and write  his wager in the club books, if she happened to offend him. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem  likely nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to find this man,&rdquo; pursued Haldane, surprised,  and a little vexed, at Faunce&rsquo;s dilettante air.</p>
<p>He had not expected to find a detective who talked like  an educated man, and he began to doubt the criminal investigator&rsquo;s professional  skill, in spite of his tin boxes and reference books, and appearance of mental power.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Lady Perivale&rsquo;s interest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, sir, you&rsquo;d better let me solve the  problem on my own lines? You are asking me to take up a tangled skein at the wrong  end. I am travelling steadily along my own road, and you want me to go off at a  tangent. I dare say I shall come to Colonel Rannock in good time, working my own  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so, I won&rsquo;t interfere,&rdquo; Haldane said, with  a troubled look. &ldquo;All my anxiety is for Lady Perivale&rsquo;s rehabilitation, and every  hour&rsquo;s delay irritates me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may safely leave the matter to me, sir. Festina  lente. These things can&rsquo;t be hurried. I shall give the case my utmost attention,  and as much time as I can spare, consistently with my duty to other clients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have other cases on your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce smiled his grave, benign smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four years ago, when I retired from the C.I., I thought I was going to settle down in a cottage at  Putney, with my good little wife, and enjoy my otium cum dignitate for the rest  of my days,&rdquo; said Faunce, confidentially, &ldquo;but, to tell you the truth, Mr. Haldane,  I found the otium rather boring, and, one or two cases falling in my way, fortuitously,  I took up the old business in a new form, and devoted myself to those curious cases  which are of frequent occurrence in the best regulated families, cases requiring  very delicate handling, inexhaustible patience, and a highly-trained skill. Since  then I have had more work brought me than I could possibly undertake; and I have  been, so far, fortunate in giving my clients satisfaction. I hope I shall satisfy  Lady Perivale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a firmness in Faunce&rsquo;s present tone that pleased  Haldane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, it was just as well that you should know  the result of my search for Rannock,&rdquo; he said, taking up his hat and stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sir. Any information bearing on the case  is of value, and I thank you for coming to me,&rdquo; answered Faunce, as he rose to escort  his visitor to the door.</p>
<p>He did not attach any significance to the fact that  Colonel Rannock had announced his intention of going to Klondyke, and had not gone  there. He might have twenty reasons for throwing his servant off the scent; or he  might have changed his mind. The new gold region is too near the North Pole to be  attractive to a man of luxurious habits, accustomed to chambers in the Albany, and the run of half  a dozen rowdy country houses, where the company was mixed and the play high.</p>
<p>Sport in Scotland  and Ireland, sport in Norway, or even in Iceland,  might inure a man to a hard life, but it would not bring him within measurable distance  of the hazards and hardships in that white world beyond Dawson City.</p>
<p>John Faunce, seated in front of his empty fireplace,  listened mechanically to a barrel-organ playing the &ldquo;Washington Post,&rdquo; and meditated  upon Arthur Haldane&rsquo;s statement.</p>
<p>He had not been idle since his return to London, and had made certain  inquiries about Colonel Rannock among people who were likely to know. He had interviewed  a fashionable gunmaker with whom Rannock had dealt for twenty years, and the secretary  of a club which he had frequented for about the same period. The man was frankly  Bohemian in his tastes, but had always kept a certain footing in society, and, in  his own phrase, had never been &ldquo;bowled out.&rdquo; He had been banished from no baccarat  table, though he was not untainted with a suspicion of occasionally tampering with  his stake. He played all the fashionable card games, and, like Dudley Smooth, though  he did not cheat, he always won. He had plenty of followers among the callow youth  who laughed at his jokes and almost died of his cigars; but he had no friends of  his own age and station, and the great ladies of the land never admitted him within  their intimate circle, though they might send him a card once or twice a year for  a big party, out of friendly feeling for his mother &mdash; five-and-twenty years a widow,  and for the greater part of her life attached to the Court.</p>
<p>Would such a man wheel a barrow and tramp the snow-bound  shores of the Yukon River? Unlikely as the thing  seemed, Faunce told himself that it was not impossible. Rannock had fought well  in the Indian hill-country, had never been a feather-bed soldier, and had never  affected the passing fashion of effeminacy. He had loved music with that inborn  love which is like an instinct, and had made himself a fine player with very little  trouble, considering the exacting nature of the &rsquo;cello; but he had never put on  dilettante airs, or pretended that music was the only thing worth living for. He  was as much at home with men who painted pictures as with composers and fiddlers.  Versatility was the chief note in his character. The Scotch University,  the Army school, the mess-room, the continental wanderings of later years, had made  him an expert in most things that people care for. He was at home in the best and  the worst society.</p>
<p>He was a soldier and a sportsman, tall, and strongly  built, a remarkably handsome man in his best days, and handsome still in his moral  and social decadence. There was no reason, Faunce thought, why such a man should  shrink from the dangers and hardships of the Alaska goldfields, if the whim took him to try  his luck there.</p>
<p>Again, there was no reason that he should not have changed  his mind at the last hour, and gone to Ostend  or Spa, to risk his capital in a more familiar way, at the gaming table instead  of the goldfields. Faunce had allies at both places, and he wrote to each of these,  bidding him find out if Rannock was, or had been, there. He was not a man who could  appear anywhere without attracting notice.</p>
<p>The letters written, Faunce dismissed the subject for  the time being. Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s importance, since he doubted if Rannock could  be made instrumental in Lady Perivale&rsquo;s rehabilitation. It was the woman he wanted,  the woman whose likeness to his client was the source of evil.</p>
<p>Women had been the chief factors in Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s successful  <i>coups</i>, and he had seldom failed in his management of that sensitive and impulsive  sex.</p>
<p>He had to find out who the woman was, and her present  whereabouts. He thought it highly the burlesque stage at some period of her career,  as actress or chorus-girl. The theatre is the only arena where low-born beauty can  win the recognition which every handsome girl believes her due; and the desire to  tread the stage is almost an instinct in the town-bred girl&rsquo;s mind. She has heard  of actresses and their triumphs ever since she can remember. She looks in her glass  and sees that she is pretty. She picks up the music-hall tunes, and shrills them  as she goes about the house-work, and is sure that she can sing. She skips and prances  to the organ in the court, and thinks that she can dance. She discovers some acquaintance  of her father&rsquo;s whose second cousin knows the stage-manager at the Thalia Theatre;  and, armed with this introduction, her pretty face forces its way to the front row  of the ballet, and her shrill voice pipes in unison with her sister cockneys in  the chorus.</p>
<p>Such an apprenticeship to the Drama Faunce thought probable  in the case of the lady known as Mrs. Randall; so he called upon two of the dramatic  agents, most of whom had become known to him in his efforts to disentangle patrician  youth from the snares of the theatrical syrens.</p>
<p>He went first to the agent of highest standing in his  profession; but this gentleman was either too much a gentleman or too busy to help  him. He glanced at Lady Perivale&rsquo;s photograph with a careless eye. Yes, a remarkably  handsome woman! But he did not remember anybody in the theatrical world who resembled  her. He remembered Sir Hubert Withernsea only as one of the wealthy young fools  whom one heard of every season, and seldom heard of long, since they must either  pull up or die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This young man died,&rdquo; said Faunce. &ldquo;Now do you happen  to remember any lady in your line to whom he attached himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I don&rsquo;t. With a young man of that kind it&rsquo;s generally  a good many ladies in my line. He gives supper parties, and chucks away his money,  and nobody cares about him or remembers him when he&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but this one had a particlar attachment, and the  lady was like this,&rdquo; said Faunce, with his hand on the photograph.</p>
<p>Non mi ricordo,&rdquo; said the agent, and Faunce went a little  way further east, to one of the smaller streets out of the Strand, not more than  ten minutes&rsquo; walk from his own office in Essex Street, and called upon agent number  two, whose chief business lay among &ldquo;the halls,&rdquo; a business that paid well and justified  handsome offices, with a lady typist, and the best and newest development in type-writing  machines.</p>
<p>Mr. Mordaunt was in the thick of the morning&rsquo;s business  when Faunce entered the office, but the detective cultivated an air of never being  in a hurry, and he seated himself near an open window in a retired spot, from which  he could observe two lady clients who were engaging Mordaunt&rsquo;s attention, and one  gentleman client in a white hat and a light-grey frock-coat, patent leather boots,  and a gardenia buttonhole, a costume more suggestive of Ascot than of the Strand,  who was looking at the innumerable photographs of lovely song-birds, skirt-dancers,  lion-comiques, and famous acrobats, that covered the wall, and reading the programmes  that hung here and there, lightly stirred by the summer air, and clouded with the  summer dust.</p>
<p>The ladies were young, handsome, in a pearl-powdery  and carmine-lipped fashion, and dressed in the top of the mode, with picture hats  on the most commanding scale, piled with the greatest number of ostrich feathers  and paste ornaments the human hat can carry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must look slippy, and get me another turn, Mordy,&rdquo;  urged the taller damsel, whose name appeared in the theatrical papers as &ldquo;Vicky  Vernon, the Wide World&rsquo;s Wonder.&rdquo; &ldquo;Fact is, I ain&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; a livin&rsquo; wage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now; forty pound from one hall and thirty from  another &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t enough, Mordy; nothink under the century suits  my book, and it didn&rsquo;t ought to suit yours, neither. You must get me another show  &mdash; another thirty quid. You know you&rsquo;ll get your commission off it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Mr. Mordaunt reckoned that he would get his ten  per cent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, you see, Vicky, there&rsquo;s ever so many ladies who  can sing bet &mdash; nearly as well as you &mdash; walking about London, with their hands in  their tailor-made pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one of &rsquo;em whose songs have ever caught on like  my &lsquo;Rats&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Demon of Drink.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those were two ripping songs, Vicky. But your new ones  haven&rsquo;t hit as hard. They&rsquo;re mawkish, Vicky; too much milk-and-water, and not enough  Tabasco. &lsquo;Rats&rsquo;  was a fine song &mdash; and you did the &lsquo;D.T.&rsquo; first-class.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man who wrote &lsquo;Rats&rsquo; is dead,&rdquo; said Miss Vernon,  with a gloomy look. &ldquo;He was a genius, poor devil. Could knock off a song like that  in a day &mdash; if he could keep sober &mdash; band-parts and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder how much you gave him for &lsquo;Rats&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to know? Well, then, not so much  by ten touch-me&rsquo;s as I give for this sunshade,&rdquo; said the charmer, with a winning  laugh, flourishing her gold-handled parasol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gave the poor devil a fiver for a song that has  earned you five thou.,&rdquo; said the agent. &ldquo;Oh, I know the ladies. They haven&rsquo;t got  much head for figures, but they are closer &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not closer than a music-hall agent, Mordy. They&rsquo;re  the nailers. And what would have been the good of giving that poor feller twenty  thick uns for a song he was glad to sell for five? He&rsquo;d only have drunk himself  into his coffin a little sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the gentleman in the white hat, who was on too  friendly terms with his professional sisters to think of removing that article of  apparel, broke in upon the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Business is business, Queen of my Soul,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but,  if you expect me to wait while you and Mordy indulge in casual patter, you don&rsquo;t  know the kind of man I am. Come, old chap, I want your private ear for a little  bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the agent by the buttonhole, and led him into  a corner, where they conversed in whispers for a few minutes, while the two stars  of the halls, the girl with fierce eyebrows and dark hair who sang &ldquo;Rats,&rdquo; and the  girl with flaxen fringe and pink cheeks, who sang baby-songs in a pinafore, walked  about the room, or stood in front of a looking-glass twitching their veils, and  correcting the slant of their hats, whistling softly the while with rosy, pursed-up  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Bill, are you going to stand Chippie and me  a scrap of lunch?&rdquo; inquired Miss Vernon, when the whispered interview was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nought o&rsquo; t&rsquo; sort, my angel; but I&rsquo;ll take you to a  snug little Italian ristoranty near Leicester Square, where you&rsquo;ll get the best  lunch in London, and I&rsquo;ll give you the inestimable advantage of my company while  you eat it &mdash; but when it comes to &lsquo;lardishong,&rsquo; it must be Yorkshire, my pretty  ones, distinctly Yorkshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a little too much Yorkshire  about you, Bill. Hurry up! Ta, ta, Mordy. Skip the gutter!&rdquo; wheeling sharply on  her Louis heels, with an artful turn of her skirt that revealed the crisp flounces  and lace ruchings of a cherry-coloured silk petticoat. &ldquo;For surely you&rsquo;ll be your  pint stoup, and surely I&rsquo;ll be mine?&rdquo; shrilled the cantatrice, in a voice whose  metallic timbre made the electric globes shiver.</p>
<p>The three professionals bounced out of the room, and  Faunce heard the ladies&rsquo; heels rattle down the stairs, and the hall door close behind  them with a bang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, quiet, refined style, Miss Vernon,&rdquo; he said,  as he seated himself opposite the agent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite what you&rsquo;d like for a permanency; gets on  your nerves after a bit &mdash; eh, Mr. Faunce?&rdquo; commented Mordaunt. &ldquo;But she knocks &rsquo;em  at the halls with her &lsquo;Rats&rsquo; and her &lsquo;Demon Drink.&rsquo; She can make their blood run  cold one minute, and make &rsquo;em roar with laughter the next. Her father died with  the horrors, and she&rsquo;s a first-rate mimic. She got every trick of the thing from  watching the old man. It ain&rsquo;t every girl of eighteen would have had the grit to  do it. The song ain&rsquo;t a &lsquo;Ta-ra-ra,&rsquo; but it has caught on, and she&rsquo;s making a pot  of money. And now, my dear sir, what&rsquo;s up with you? Who are you lookin&rsquo; for, and  what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to throw your memory back ten years, Mordaunt.  Do you remember Sir Hubert Withernsea? He was knocking about London at that time, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. Yorkshire  swell, regular oof-bird, and a born mug; ran through his money as if he had an unnatural  curiosity to see the inside of a workhouse. But he was a good-natured bloke; and  I&rsquo;ve seen some first-class company at his Sunday dinners, in a house he had in the  Abbey Road.  He used to have a dinner-party every Sunday in May and June, and a game of cards  after dinner, and one met some queer specimens there sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there a lady at the head of his table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather! There was Lady Withernsea &mdash; everybody called  her Lady Withernsea in her own house, whatever they may have called her out of it.  I knew her as Kate Delmaine, in the chorus at the Spectacular Theatre; but it isn&rsquo;t  for me to say he hadn&rsquo;t married her. He was fool enough for anything, and he was  awfully fond of her, and awfully jealous of every man who ventured to pay her attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever meet a Colonel Rannock there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I ever dine there without seeing him? Rannock was  &lsquo;mine own familiar friend&rsquo; &mdash; the Mephistopheles to Withernsea&rsquo;s Faust. I believe  Rannock pouched more of his stuff than anybody else in the gang, though they were  all blackguards. I never touched a card in his house; so I can talk of them with  a clear conscience. A gang of well-bred swindlers, that&rsquo;s what I call them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chorus-girl was handsome, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Strange to say, she was. She was worth all the  money Withernsea spent on her; and I suppose it&rsquo;s about the only bargain he ever  made in which he wasn&rsquo;t had. She was one of the handsomest women that ever stepped  upon the Spectacular stage; and while she was behind the footlights not a man in  the stalls had eyes for anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she anything like that?&rdquo; asked Faunce, handing  him Lady Perivale&rsquo;s photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was. Ten years ago you might have passed that off  for her photo. But she ain&rsquo;t up to that now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen her lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was here the week before last, a wreck, looking  ill and poor. I never knew a handsome woman go off so sudden. I saw her in a box  Drury Lane  last Christmas, in fine form; but that&rsquo;s all over. She wanted me to get her an engagement  &mdash; chorus again &mdash; she was never up to speaking parts, used to lose her head directly  she had to utter. I couldn&rsquo;t do anything for her. We&rsquo;ve no use for anything old  and faded at the West End theatres. Managers won&rsquo;t  consider it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me the lady&rsquo;s address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I booked it,&rdquo; said the agent, &ldquo;just to satisfy  her, though I knew it was no use &mdash; at any rate not till the pantomime season, when  I might get her an engagement for a Flora or a Juno at the back of the stage, or  a Queen in a historical procession, perhaps. Yes, here it is: Mrs. Randall, Miss  Kate Delmaine, 14, Selburne Street,   Chelsea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Mordaunt,&rdquo; replied Faunce, handing him a  sovereign. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to waste your time for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Faunce, time is money, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said Mordaunt,  pocketing the coin with a pleasant smile.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And the Abb&eacute; uncrossed his legs,<br>
  Took snuff, a reflective pinch.<br>
  Broke silence: &lsquo;The question begs<br>
  Much pondering ere I pronounce. Shall I flinch?<br>
  The love which to one and one only has reference<br>
Seems terribly like what perhaps gains God&rsquo;s preference.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce ate his modest luncheon at the immemorial Cock;  and, after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s rest and meditation, assisted by tobacco, took  a hansom and drove to Selburne Street, which the cabman discovered, after some research,  in a labyrinth of shabby streets between the King&rsquo;s Road and the Thames, to the  west of the redbrick mansions of Cheyne Walk, and all the pleasantness of fashionable  Chelsea &mdash; a wilderness of eight-roomed houses, slate roofs, narrow areas, steep  steps, dirty windows, and gutters overcharged with small children: one of those  depressing neighbourhoods which fill the stranger&rsquo;s mind with a despairing pity,  but where, nevertheless, there exist worthy, hard-working people who contrive somehow  to be happy, and even comfortable &mdash; people who have their Christmas puddings and  their household affections, like the Cratchets, and who do not desire to curse God  and die.</p>
<p>The houses in Selburne Street were of the same pattern as  most of the other streets, and just as shabby, but a little larger. The door at  No. 14 was opened by the landlady, who did not know, or apparently care, whether  Mrs. Randall was at home or out, but who bade the visitor go up to the first-floor  front and inquire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got her key,&rdquo; said this lady,&rdquo; and I don&rsquo;t always  hear her come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce went upstairs and tapped politely at the door  of the front room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, whoever you are,&rdquo; said a voice, with a listless  melancholy in its tone.</p>
<p>An odour of tobacco greeted Faunce as he opened the  door, and a woman sitting by the window threw the end of a cigarette into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Jim?&rdquo; she asked drearily, with her face  towards the window; then, turning, and seeing a stranger, she gave a cry of surprise  that had a touch of fear in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; she cried sharply, and Faunce saw  that her hand shook a little as she caught hold of a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nerves gone. The usual thing,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;drink or  drugs; the usual resource when bad luck sets in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have ventured to call upon you on a matter of business,  Mrs. Randall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;without writing to ask leave. But as it&rsquo;s a business that  may be profitable &mdash; very profitable &mdash; to yourself, I hope you will pardon the liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she asked fiercely. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any  of your gammon. Who are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a wreck. The agent had been right so far. But  she was a beautiful wreck The brilliant colouring was faded, the cheeks were hollow,  the eyes haggard, but the perfect lines of the face were there; and Faunce saw that  she had been beautiful, and also that when she was at her best she must have been  curiously like Lady Perivale. In height, in figure, in the poise of the head, the  modelling of the throat, she resembled her as a sister might have done.</p>
<p>She must have fallen upon evil days since her visit  to Algiers &mdash; very  evil days. There was the pinch of poverty in her aspect, in her tawdry morning wrapper,  in the shabbily-furnished sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be alarmed, madam. My business is not of  an unpleasant nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know who and what you are!&rdquo; she said in the  same tone, half fear, half fury; &ldquo;and how you had the cheek to march into my room  without sending up your name first. Do you think because I&rsquo;m in cheap lodgings I  ain&rsquo;t a lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your landlady told me to come upstairs, or I should  not have taken that liberty. That is my name,&rdquo; handing her a card, which she snatched  impatiently and looked at with a scowling brow. &ldquo;I am engaged in the interests of  a lady whose social position has suffered by her resemblance to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in Algiers  last February with Colonel Rannock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her face lost colour, and her breathing quickened, as  she answered &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were seen by friends of my client, and mistaken  for her, and the result was a scandal which has seriously affected that lady. Now,  in the event of a libel suit, which is very likely to arise out of that scandal,  it will be in your power to put matters straight by stepping into the witness-box,  and stating that you were Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s travelling companion in Algiers, and Corsica, and Sardinia  last winter. The lady will be in court, and the likeness between you and her will  explain the mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you and your lady client in &mdash; first!&rdquo; answered  the termagant. &ldquo;I wonder at your check in coming to ask a lady to give herself away  like that. You just make yourself scarce, Mr. Faunce,&rdquo; looking at his card. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t  another word to say to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, you have, Mrs. Randall. You have got to ask  me what recompense I am prepared to offer you for your assistance in this little  matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe a word of your story; and I want to  see you outside that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, madam. Is it reasonable to be so touchy  with a man who comes to propose a very profitable transaction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by profitable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean that in the event of the libel suit coming off,  and your going into the witness-box and swearing that you were with Rannock from  the beginning to the end of that little tour, I am prepared to pay you a hundred  pounds. A hundred pounds for one morning&rsquo;s work. Not so bad, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her colour had come back, and, after a long scrutiny  of Faunce&rsquo;s amiable countenance, she seemed reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said, and seated herself opposite him,  with her elbows on the table and her chin in her hands.</p>
<p>He noted the wedding-ring, and two or three trumpery  turquoise and garnet rings on her left hand. Her day of splendour was past, and  the spoils of her youth had vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred ain&rsquo;t much, if your client is a rich woman,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;Of course, I can guess who she is &mdash; Lady Perivale. I&rsquo;ve been told I&rsquo;m  like her. If it&rsquo;s her, she can afford to pay two hundred quid as easy as one. And  I ain&rsquo;t going to stand up in court and tell my life and adventures for a lower figure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a hard one, Mrs. Randall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hard-up one, Mr. Faunce. There&rsquo;s no use denying  it when you see me in such a beggarly hole as this. I ain&rsquo;t used to it. I&rsquo;ve lived  like a lady ever since I was eighteen years old, and this beastly lodging-house  gets upon my nerves. That&rsquo;s why I was so nasty with you when you came in,&rdquo; she concluded,  with a little laugh that didn&rsquo;t sound quite genuine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Randall, if you oblige my client I know  she will deal generously with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred quid paid down before I go into the box;  not a penny less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about it. In the mean time, to show good  faith, there&rsquo;s a trifle on account,&rdquo; said Faunce, handing her a ten-pound note.</p>
<p>He would have offered her more had he found her in better  surroundings, but he reckoned the rooms she was in at ten shillings a week, and  he thought she had come to her lowest stage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she said, putting the note in a shabby <i>porte-monnaie</i>,  whose contents Faunce&rsquo;s eye discovered in the instant of its opening &mdash; sixpence  and a few coppers.</p>
<p>The door opened suddenly at this moment, and Faunce,  who sat opposite, caught one brief glimpse of the man who opened it, and who, on  seeing him, stepped back, shut it quickly, and ran downstairs. Faunce started up,  and was at the window in time to see the visitor leave the house, and walk down  the street. He was a big man, with broad shoulders and a bull neck, flashily dressed,  and with a fox-terrier at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry I frightened your friend away,&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it don&rsquo;t matter. He can come another time if he  wants to see me,&rdquo; Mrs. Randall answered carelessly.</p>
<p>That sensitive complexion of hers had paled at the interruption,  just as at the mention of Rannock&rsquo;s name, and a gloomy look had come into her eyes.  The visitor could hardly have been the bringer of pleasant things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old friend of yours?&rdquo; hazarded Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh lord, yes; old enough! I&rsquo;ve known him since I was  a kid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But apparently not a favourite of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no favourites,&rdquo; she answered curtly. &ldquo;All  I want is to go my own way, and not to be bothered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody can call that an unreasonable desire, madam.  And now will you be so very kind as to oblige me with one of your photographs &mdash;  one that, in your own opinion, does you most justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it had better be one that wasn&rsquo;t taken yesterday,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;They wipe the wrinkles out, but they can&rsquo;t hide the lantern jaws. Oh,  you can have a photo if you want one; I&rsquo;ve got plenty. The photographers were the  plague of my life when I was on the boards, and as long as I was about London, driving my carriage.  But they&rsquo;ve left off worrying now. There&rsquo;s new faces in the market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None handsomer than yours, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dragged open a reluctant drawer in an ill-made mahogany  sideboard, and produced half a dozen cabinet photographs, from which Faunce selected  two of the best, with polite acknowledgment of the favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my address, Mrs. Randall,&rdquo; he said, rising,  and taking up his hat; &ldquo;let me know if you change your quarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t be able to do that &mdash; on a tenner,&rdquo; she said;  &ldquo;but it will keep me out of the workhouse for a week or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By-the-by, can you tell me where Colonel Rannock is  to be found at this present time?&rdquo; Faunce asked, as he shook hands with her.</p>
<p>Her hand was in his when he asked the question, and  he felt it grow cold. She was fond of Rannock, he thought &mdash; fond of him, and angry  with him for abandoning her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she answered, looking at him steadily,  but with the same pale change in her face that he had noted before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m told he went to San Francisco,  <i>vi&agrave;</i> New York, on his way to the Alaska goldfields,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe he went to the goldfields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know when he started?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some time in March. I don&rsquo;t remember the date.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember by what line he went &mdash; whether from  Liverpool or Southampton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about him &mdash; after he left London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Randall, expect to hear from me soon. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce left her, pleased with his success. Everything  was now easy. There was nothing wanted but the audacious libel, which should afford  ground for an action; and that, as Mr. Faunce told Lady Perivale, would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>He was satisfied, but he was also thoughtful. There  had been something unaccountable in the woman&rsquo;s manner: that strange mixture of  anger and apprehension, the sick, white look that came over her face when she spoke  of Rannock. Something evil there was assuredly &mdash; some hidden thing in her mind which  made that name a sound of fear.</p>
<p>He had studied the woman intently during the quarter  of an hour&rsquo;s <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, and he did not think that she was a bad woman, from the  criminal point of view. He did not think she was treacherous or cruel. If any evil  thing had befallen Rannock, the evil was not her doing. And, after all, her agitation  might be only that of a woman of shattered nerves and quick feelings, who had loved  intensely and been badly treated &mdash; cast off and left in poverty &mdash; by the man she  loved. It might be that the perturbed look which he had taken for fear was not fear,  but resentment.</p>
<p>He telegraphed to Lady Perivale, asking for an appointment,  and presented himself at Runnymede Grange on the following afternoon. He had not  seen his client since their first interview, and he was astonished at the change  in her countenance and manner. On the former occasion she had been all gloom: to-day  she was all brightness. The nervous irritability, the fiery indignation were gone.  She treated the subject of her wrongs in a business-like tone, almost as a bagatelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened since I saw her. Something that  has changed the whole tenor of her life,&rdquo; thought Faunce.</p>
<p>He had a shrewd idea of what that &ldquo;something&rdquo; was a  few minutes later, when Lady Perivale told him that she would like a friend, in  whose judgment she had confidence, to hear his report; and when Arthur Haldane came  into the room &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Faunce,&rdquo; said Grace, in a tone that showed  her friend had been told all about him; and the two men saluted each other politely,  without any hint of their former meeting.</p>
<p>Faunce told Lady Perivale that he had found the woman  who resembled her, and that her evidence would be ready when it was required.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not shrink from standing up in court and acknowledging  that she was with Colonel Rannock in Algiers?&rdquo;  asked Lady Perivale, wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t shrink &mdash; provided the reward is good  enough. She is prepared to tell the truth &mdash; and &mdash; shame the devil &mdash; for two hundred  pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give her ten times as much if she wants it!&rdquo; cried  Lady Perivale. &ldquo;But what are we to do if nobody libels me? Messrs Rosset have sent  me two or three newspaper paragraphs. They are very insolent, but I&rsquo;m afraid one  could hardly go to law about them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At Faunce&rsquo;s request she produced the impertinent snippets,  pasted on flimsy green paper.</p>
<p>From the <i>Morning Intelligencer:</i> &ldquo;Lady Perivale, whose  small dinners and suppers after the opera were so popular last season, has not done  any entertaining this year. She is living in her house in Grosvenor Square, but is spending the summer  in strict retirement. She may be seen in the morning riding with the &lsquo;liver brigade,&rsquo;  and she occasionally takes an afternoon drive in the Park; but she has joined in  none of the season&rsquo;s festivities &mdash; a fact that has caused some gossip in the inner  circles of the smart world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Miranda&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cr&ecirc;me de la Cr&ecirc;me,&rdquo; in the <i>Hesperus:</i>  &ldquo;Among the beauties at Lady Morningside&rsquo;s ball, Lady Perivale was conspicuous by  her absence, although last season she was so prominent a personage in the Morningside  set. What can be the cause of this self-effacement on the part of a young and wealthy  widow who had the ball of fashion at her feet last year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were other paragraphs of the same calibre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Lady Perivale,&rdquo; Faunce said, after having  gravely read them. &ldquo;These are not good enough. We must wait for something better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that somebody will libel me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am &mdash; almost &mdash; sure that you will be called upon to  punish some very gross libel within the next few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I hope I shall have the pleasure of horsewhipping  the writer, and the editor who publishes it!&rdquo; said Haldane, hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, Mr. Haldane,&rdquo; cried Faunce, earnestly,  &ldquo;nothing of that kind! It is necessary that Lady Perivale should be publicly insulted,  in order that she may be publicly justified. Nothing short of the appearance of  the woman who was mistaken for her ladyship can give the lie direct to the scandal.  I must beg, therefore, that the writer of the libel may be held secure from personal  violence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Haldane was silent. His fingers were itching for a stout  malacca and for a scoundrel&rsquo;s back upon which to exercise it. He would have given  so much to focus the malignant slander that had followed the woman he loved, and  had made even him, her adoring lover, begin to doubt her, with a wavering faith  of which he was now so deeply ashamed.</p>
<p>Oh, to have some one to punish with sharp physical pain,  some craven hound to offer up as a sacrifice to his own remorse!</p>

<p>The atmosphere of Grace Perivale&rsquo;s life was changed.  John Faunce&rsquo;s keen eye for character had not erred in this particular case. Lady  Perivale at Runnymede Grange was not the same woman the detective had conversed  with in Grosvenor Square.</p>
<p>Happy love leaves no room for troubled thoughts in a  woman&rsquo;s mind; and from the hour when Grace learnt that Arthur Haldane was her trusting  and devoted lover, she began to forget the frivolous friends whose desertion she  had so deeply resented. She forgot to be angry, because she had ceased to care.  That outer world, the world of Mayfair and Belgravia, with its sordid interests  and petty ambitions, the world of South African millionaires and new-made nobility,  the world to which every smart personage was living in some other smart personage&rsquo;s  house, and everybody who wasn&rsquo;t accredited with millions was suspected of being  on the brink of insolvency; that <i>&eacute;lite</i>, over-civilized and decadent world &mdash; dazzling  and alluring in the phosphorescent radiance of decay &mdash; seemed so remote from all  that makes happiness, that it could not be worth thinking about.</p>
<p>Her world now lay within so narrow a circle. Her world  began and ended in a poet, critic, and romancer, whose dreams, thoughts, opinions,  and aspirations, filled her mind to overflowing. He was her world, Arthur Haldane,  the man of letters, to whom she was to be married as soon as this preposterous scandal  was swept into the world&rsquo;s great ragbag of forgotten things.</p>
<p>The words had been spoken at last, words that had been  in his heart two years ago, when Grace Perivale&rsquo;s beauty first flashed like sudden  sunshine into the level grey of his life, and when he discovered that behind the  beauty there was a brain and a heart.</p>
<p>He had held himself in check then, had courted her society  under a mask of indifference, for more than one reason. First, because she was rich,  and a much-talked-of prize in the matrimonial market; next, because of his jealous  fear that Rannock&rsquo;s showy accomplishments and charm of manner had won her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I hope to prevail &mdash; a dry-as-dust scribbler  &mdash; against a man who had been called irresistible?&rdquo; he asked, when Grace reproached  him for his aloofness in that first year of their acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dry-as-dust scribbler who had written the most pathetic  story of the last half century. Every tear I shed over &lsquo;Mary Deane&rsquo; was a link that  bound me to the man who wrote the book. Of course I don&rsquo;t pretend that if the man  had been fat and elderly &mdash; like Richardson  &mdash; I should have fallen in love with him. But even then I should have valued him,  as the young women of those days valued the fat little printer. I should have courted  his society, and hung upon his words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not every novelist who is so lucky,&rdquo; said Haldane.  &ldquo;I think I am the first, since Balzac, whose book has won him the love that crowns  a life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What fairer Eden could  there be than that reach of the Thames in a fine  August? Other men were turning their faces northward with dogs and guns, ready for  havoc on &ldquo;the twelfth,&rdquo; or waiting impatiently for &ldquo;the first.&rdquo; But Arthur Haldane,  who was no mean shot, and had invitations to half a dozen country houses, behaved  like a man who had never lifted a gun to his shoulder. The veriest cockney could  not have been happier in that river <i>idlesse</i>, in which a punt-pole was his most strenuous  exertion, and to boil a tea-kettle his most exciting sport. The summer days, the  golden evenings were never too long, and the crimson of the sunset seemed always  a surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you must be wanting to kill things,&rdquo; Grace said  one evening; &ldquo;and you must hate me keeping you dawdling here. I am glad you are  not grouse-shooting, for I have always dreaded the moors since my poor Hector caught  his death in the ceaseless downpour of one dreadful August day. But why do you not  go to your Norfolk  friends for the partridge-shooting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind and thoughtful, but my Norfolk friends were always  a trifle boring, and they would be intolerable now, if they kept me away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very flattering to my vanity. But I will not  have you tied to my apron-string.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you if ever the string galls. Come what  may, I am not going to leave the neighbourhood of London till your lawsuit has been settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hoped that everything would be over before the  late autumn, so that they could start for Cairo at  the right season; and from Cairo they might go on  to India.  They were of a humour to ramble over the world together; but in the meantime life  was so sweet in the Thames backwaters, among flowering rushes and under dipping  willows, and on the lawn at Runnymede Grange, that they seldom went as much as a  mile afield. Lovers are like children at play in a garden, who dream of the days  when they will be grown up and sail through blue skies in a balloon, to find where  the world leaves off.</p>
<p>Grace looked back, in many a happy reverie, and recalled  that year before the beginning of the scandal, when the man who was now her impassioned  lover had seemed to her cold and distant. Only by his seriousness in seeking her  society, his grave pleasure in ministering to her love of books, and bringing her  in touch with the choicest things in contemporary literature, could Lady Perivale  discover that his friendship was any more than the admiring regard which every intelligent  man must needs feel for a young and beautiful woman who is also intelligent. Much  as Haldane admired beauty &mdash; from its spiritual essence in a picture by Burne-Jones,  to its earthliest form in a Roman flower-girl on the steps below the Church of the  Trinity &mdash; his affections would never have been taken captive by beauty allied with  silliness. He was a man to whom community of thought was an essential element in  love. And, in Grace Perivale, he had discovered mind and imagination in sympathy  with his own thoughts and dreams; and he was completely happy in her company, happy  to be her friend, yet hesitating to become her lover, till, in some future day,  her intimate knowledge of his character might make it impossible for her to misread  his motives.</p>
<p>And then had come the bitter blow, when he, who had  tortured himself with jealous apprehensions of her liking for Colonel Rannock, heard  the story of those chance meetings in the South.</p>
<p>He had been vehement in his denunciation of the slander.  If the story were so far true that she was the person who had been seen with Rannock,  could any one who knew her doubt for a moment that he had a legal right to her company,  that they had been quietly married, and, for some reason of their own, chose to  delay the publication of their marriage.</p>
<p>He was laughed at for his vehemence, and for his simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear of a woman throwing her cap over  the mill?&rdquo; asked his friend. &ldquo;Have you lived so long in a civilized world, and don&rsquo;t  you know that women are always doing the most unexpected things? Have you known  no delicately-reared woman take to the gin-bottle and drink herself to death? Have  you never heard of the household angel &mdash; the devoted wife and mother &mdash; who, after  twenty years of honourable wedlock, went off with her daughter&rsquo;s Italian singing-master?  And these rich women are the very sort who go wrong. Their opulence demoralizes  them. They are petty Cleopatras, and pine for the fierce passion of a C&aelig;sar or a  Marc Antony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was not much stirring in London in the early part of that season, and the  scandal about Lady Perivale was dinned into Haldane&rsquo;s ears wherever he went. Young  women talked about it, in allusive speech, with a pretence of na&iuml;vet&eacute;. What was  the story? They pretended not to know what it all meant; but they knew their mothers  were not going to call upon her ever again; so they opined that it must be something  very dreadful, considering the sort of people their mothers went on visiting and  entertaining season after season. It must be something worse than the things that  were said about Lady Such-and-Such, or even about Mrs. So-and-So.</p>
<p>Haldane heard, and the iron entered into his soul; and  he held himself aloof from the woman he loved, fearing, doubting, waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that man appears upon the scene I shall know it&rsquo;s  all over,&rdquo; he thought.</p>
<p>He walked from his rooms in Jermyn Street to Grosvenor Square every night, and paced the  pavements within view of Lady Perivale&rsquo;s windows, steering clear of the houses where  there were parties, with awnings, and blocks of bystanders, and policemen, and linkmen.  He saw the lighted windows of the morning-room, and sometimes saw a graceful shadow  flit across the blind, and knew that she was there, and alone. No masculine form  ever passed between the lamp and the windows. Susan Rodney appeared there once or  twice a week, and he sometimes saw her driven away in a humble four-wheeler, on  the stroke of eleven. But the figure he feared to see never crossed the threshold.</p>
<p>And then a man at his club told him that Rannock had  not been in London  that season. He had gone under. He was said to be in America, but that was as might be. He  had come to the end of his tether.</p>
<p>It had been a time of agonizing doubt, expiated by almost  as agonizing remorse. But it was over now, and life was a dream of bliss &mdash; a dream  of the fast coming days when Grace Perivale would be his wife, when the evening  shadows would bring no parting, the night no loneliness.</p>
<p>Susan Rodney was an ideal third for a pair of lovers,  as she had plenty of interests and occupations of her own, spending all her leisure  in the composition of a light opera which she had been engaged upon for years, with  only a faint hope of ever getting it produced; perhaps in Brussels, perhaps in Frankfort,  she dared hardly think of London.</p>
<p>Absorbed in the thrilling delight of a quintette, or  a chorus, Sue only gave the lovers her company when they wanted it, which they very  often did, as her bright and cheerful spirit harmonized with their own happiness.  They both liked her, and were both very sure of her sympathy.</p>
<p>In one of their garden <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>, their talk having  drifted on to Haldane&rsquo;s famous novel, the one work of fiction which had made his  reputation with the general reader, he confessed to having nearly finished a second  story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only began it in May,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;during a fit of  insomnia. My mind was full of scorpions, like Macbeth&rsquo;s, and I think I should have  gone mad if I had not summoned those shadows from the unseen world, and set myself  to anatomize them. It is a bitter book, a story of Fate&rsquo;s worst irony; and in a  better period of English literature &mdash; in the day of Scott, or Dickens and Thackeray  &mdash; it would have stood no chance of being widely read. But we have changed all that. This is the day of ctuel books. Most of us have turned our books into scalpels. And I think this story of mine is cruel enough to hit the public taste.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing that touches your life or mine in
it?&rdquo; Grace asked, with a touch of alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no; not one thought. I wrote it while I
  was trying to forget you&mdash;and trying still harder to forget
  myself. The shadows that move in it bear not the
  faintest resemblance to you or me. It is a sordid book,
  a study of human meanness, and the misery that dull
  minds make for themselves: pale-grey miseries that
  gradually draw to a focus and deepen to blood-red
  tragedy. But it has one redeeming feature&mdash;one really
  good man&mdash;a city missionary, humbly born, plain, selfeducated,
  but a Christ-like character. I should have
burnt the book unfinished but for him. He came to my relief when my story and I were sinking into a slough
of despond.&rdquo;</p>
<p> &ldquo;You talk as if the web were not of your weaving,
  as if you had no power over the figures that move in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no such power, Grace. They come to me as mysteriously  as the shadows in a dream, and their spell is strong. I cannot create them; and  I cannot change them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wanted him to read his story to her before it was  printed; but this was just the one thing he could not do. He could not imagine himself  reading his own words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would make me hate my work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Every clumsy  phrase, every banal word, would leap out of the page and gibber at me as I read.  I will bring you the first copy fresh from the press, and when you have read it  you shall tell me afterwards whether I am ever to write another story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall write another, and another, and go on writing,&rdquo;  she answered gaily. &ldquo;You will give me a second world, a world peopled with strange  or lovely creatures &mdash; villains as colossal as Milton&rsquo;s Satan, heroines as innocent as his Eve.  My life in the world of your imagining will be almost as intense as your own. You  will give me a second existence, better than the every-day world. You will tell  me about your dream-people, won&rsquo;t you, Arthur, as they spring into life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fear is that I shan&rsquo;t be able to refrain from talking  of them, to the other half of my soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot weary the other half by much talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Do you think not? I can imagine a husband&rsquo;s art becoming  an unspeakable bore to his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if she loves him and loves his art.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s the rub.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Perivale was recalled from the shadow-world of  the novelist by the substantial apparition of John Faunce, who arrived unannounced  on a sultry afternoon, and found her sitting in the garden with Mr. Haldane and  Miss Rodney, at a table strewn with all the new magazines and some of the old poets,  in those miniature editions that so lend themselves to being carried about and not  read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I might venture to call without notice,&rdquo;  said Faunce, &ldquo;as I have some rather important news for your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A libel &mdash; a most audacious libel,&rdquo; said Faunce, taking  a paper from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? where? What paper?&rdquo; Grace and Sue exclaimed  excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange to say, in a society paper of most respectable  character, though of a somewhat limited circulation,&rdquo; replied Faunce; &ldquo;a paper which,  to my knowledge, has never offended in this manner until now &mdash; the <i>Bon Ton and Cricket  Review</i>, a journal printed at Kennington, and mostly circulated in the South of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the paper to Lady Perivale, who turned the  leaves hurriedly, too agitated to read a line for the first few minutes.</p>
<p>It was an eminently proper paper &mdash; a paper that told  of dances at Tooting, private theatricals at Norwood, and At Homes at Tulse Hill, a paper that  described dresses and millinery, and gave receipts for cornflower creams and jellies  made without wine, for cleaning kid gloves and making golden hair-dye. Pages were  devoted to the Oval, and other pages to school cricket. There was the usual short  story of the ultra-smart world. There was a Denmark Hill celebrity at home. There  was everything nice and proper that a Society paper should have; and there, amidst  all this respectability &mdash; like a hideous wen upon a handsome face &mdash; appeared three  atrocious paragraphs about Lady Perivale&rsquo;s <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> tour with Colonel Rannock;  the first setting forth the surprise of the lady&rsquo;s friends on meeting her travelling  alone with a man of dubious character; the second debating whether the freedom of  <i>fin-de-si&egrave;cle</i> manners would not permit of any lady travelling with any gentleman  without causing scandal; the third, of a some-what grosser tone, winding up with  a couplet from Pope:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Nor C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s empress would I deign to prove,<br>
No, make me mistress to the man I love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s abominable!&rdquo; cried Grace, flushing crimson, and  throwing down the paper in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you tell me I&rsquo;m not to horsewhip the scoundrel  who wrote that!&rdquo; said Haldane, who had read the paragraphs over her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do &mdash; most decidedly,&rdquo; answered Faunce, edging away  from him with an involuntary movement. &ldquo;We wanted a libel &mdash; a gross libel &mdash; and  we&rsquo;ve got it, We are going to bring an action against the proprietor of the <i>Bon  Ton</i>, but we are not going to put ourselves in the wrong by assaulting him first.  No, sir, we shall proceed against the proprietor, editor, and printer of the <i>Bon  Ton</i>, and we shall ask for exemplary damages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damages!&rdquo; exclaimed Grace. &ldquo;Do you suppose I want  the loathsome creature&rsquo;s money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not make it a criminal suit, and send him to prison?&rdquo;  asked Haldane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, sir. Her ladyship&rsquo;s solicitors, Messrs.  Harding, have gone into the matter with me, and we are agreed that a criminal action  is not advisable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does this thing happen to appear so long after  the circulation of the scandal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s the question,&rdquo; said Faunce, blandly. &ldquo;You  see, fashionable gossip takes a considerable time to cross the Thames and filter down to Tooting. The proprietor &mdash; and editor  &mdash; lives at Tooting, and I dare say, to his mind, the slander appeared a novelty.  I&rsquo;m glad he didn&rsquo;t get hold of it sooner, for we should not have been prepared to  deal with the case as we are now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rodney had picked up the <i>Bon Ton</i>, and was reading  the paragraphs with a frowning brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you look at that atrocious stuff?&rdquo; cried Grace,  snatching the paper from her and rolling it into a ball for her poodle, who rushed  across the lawn with it and then laid himself down and proceeded to tear it into  shreds with his paws and teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s lucky that isn&rsquo;t the only copy in existence, Lady  Perivale, &ldquo;said Faunce.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter13"></a>Chapter 13</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;They draw a nourishment<br>
  Out of defamings, grow upon disgraces;<br>
  And, when they see a virtue fortified<br>
  Strongly above the battery of their tongues,<br>
Oh, how they cast to sink it!</p>
<p>One of the most interesting cases in the Law Courts  that winter was <i>Perivale v. Brown Smith</i>, a claim of &pound;10,000 damages on account of  a gross libel published in a paper of which the defendant was editor and proprietor.</p>
<p>Brown Smith pleaded justification, and it was said that  he was going to make a good fight, and that he would produce witnesses who had met  the lady and gentleman on their travels as Mr. and Mrs. Randall.</p>
<p>The case came on late in November, when there were a  good many people in town, staying for the weeks before Christmas, or passing through;  and the court was packed with smart clothes and well-known faces. Conspicuous among  these curious impertinents were two well-known figures in the little world of Belgravia  and Mayfair: Lady Morningside, whose ample person, clothed in black satin and chinchilla,  filled a considerable space on the privileged seats; and the spare and wiry form  of &ldquo;the most honourable,&rdquo; her husband, a man whose weather-beaten countenance, trim  whiskers and keen eye, cut-away coat and Bedford cords, indicated the indomitable  sportsman.</p>
<p>Eye-glasses and opera-glasses glittered across the fog,  and the point to which they were chiefly directed was the figure of Lady Perivale,  in a neat black gown, with cape and toque of Russian sable, seated in the well of  the court, with Arthur Haldane sitting beside her.</p>
<p>There was much whispering among the eye-glasses about  the lady and her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as handsome as ever,&rdquo; said one; &ldquo;I was told  she had gone off dreadfully. Rather audacious to bring this action, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a dangerous move, I should think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! she&rsquo;s got Sir Joseph Jalland. He always wins when  there&rsquo;s a pretty woman to orate about. You&rsquo;ll see, he&rsquo;ll make the jury shed tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What odds will you give me against that fat man in  the corner being the first to weep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! It&rsquo;s going to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Waltham, Sir Joseph&rsquo;s junior, opened the pleadings  in an undertone, which sent all the picture-hats distracted. They thought they were  losing the fun. And then a thrill ran round the Court as Sir Joseph Jalland rose  in his might, adjusted his <i>pince-nez</i>, trifled with the leaves of his brief, and  then slowly began to unfold his case. The deep, grave voice made all the aigrets  shiver, and every lorgnette and binocular was turned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This greatly injured lady &mdash; this lady, whose life of  blameless purity, life spent in an exalted sphere &mdash; in the sheltered haven of a  congenial marriage, this lady whose spotless character should have shielded her  from the lightest breath of slander, has been made a target for the salaried traducer  of a venomous rag that calls itself a newspaper, and has been allowed to drivel  its poisonous paragraphs week after week, secure in its insignificance, and a disgrace  to the Press to which it pretends to belong,&rdquo; flinging down the <i>South London Bon  Ton</i> on the desk before him, with a movement of unutterable loathing, as if his hand  recoiled instinctively from the foul contact. &ldquo;She has been made the subject of  a slander so futile, so preposterous, that one marvels less at the malice of the  writer than at his imbecility. A woman of gentle birth and exalted position, hemmed  round and protected by all those ceremonial ramparts that are at once the restraint  and privilege of wealth and social status, is supposed to have roamed the Continent  with her paramour, braving public opinion with the brazen hardihood of the trained  courtesan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This and much more, in its proper place and sequence,  did Sir Joseph&rsquo;s deep voice give to the listening ears of the Court, before he summoned  his first witness, in the person of the plaintiff, Grace Perivale.</p>
<p>Her evidence was given in a steady voice and with perfect  self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever travel on the Continent with Colonel Rannock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you in Corsica  in the January of this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or in Algiers  in February?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be so good as to say where you were living  during January and February last?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at my villa near Porto Maurizio from November  last year until the beginning of April in this year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Joseph had no more questions to ask. The defendant&rsquo;s  counsel exercised his right to cross-examine the witness, who stood facing the Court,  calm and proud, but deadly pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were these paragraphs in the &mdash; er&rdquo; &mdash; looking at his  brief&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Bon Ton</i>, the first you had heard of a scandal associating your name with  Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s, Lady Perivale?&rdquo; he asked blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the first time such a scandal had appeared in  print.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the scandal was not unfamiliar to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had heard of it before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On several occasions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was told that such a thing had been said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that your friends believed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one!&rdquo; the witness answered indignantly. &ldquo;No friend  of mine believed one word of the story!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flushed and paled again as she spoke. She shot one  involuntary glance towards the man who was so much more than a friend, and who had  almost believed that slander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will admit, I think, Lady Perivale, that the story  had been common talk for a long time before this society journal got hold of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about common talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Lady Perivale,&rdquo; said the counsel.</p>
<p>Lady Perivale&rsquo;s butler and maid were the next witnesses.</p>
<p>They had been with their mistress at Porto Maurizio  from November to April, during which period she had never been absent from the villa  for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>The defendant&rsquo;s counsel cross-examined both witnesses,  and made a praiseworthy &mdash; but unsuccessful &mdash; attempt to cast ridicule and doubt  upon the two old servants, whom he tried hard to place before the jury as overpaid  and venal hirelings, willing to perjure themselves to any extent for their employer.  He gratified his professional vanity by letting off two or three forensic <i>bon mots</i>,  and succeeded in raising a laugh or two at the expense of the country-bred Abigail  and the dignified London  butler; but the endeavour to weaken their testimony was an ignominious failure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, my lord, would complete my case,&rdquo; said Sir Joseph  Jalland, &ldquo;were it not essential that the falsehood and the folly of the slander  in this scurrilous rag,&rdquo; striking the <i>Bon Ton</i> with his open hand, &ldquo;should be stamped  out at once and for ever; and in order that this may be effectually done &mdash; to prove  indubitably that Lady Perivale was not with Colonel Rannock during his Continental  wanderings last winter, I shall produce the person who was with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kate Delmaine stepped into the box, admirably dressed,  like Lady Perivale, in a black cloth gown, and wearing a sable toque almost of the  same fashion. A murmur of surprise ran round the Court, an excited whispering and  twittering, which the usher hastened to suppress.</p>
<p>Seen in that November gloom, the witness looked like  Grace Perivale&rsquo;s double.</p>
<p>Kate Delmaine! There were some among the wigs and gowns,  and some among the smart audience who remembered her in her brief career, a girl  of startling beauty, whose dazzling smile had beamed across the footlights at the  Spectacular Theatre for a season or two. They had seen, admired, and forgotten her.  She rose before them like the ghost of their youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me where you were living last February,  Miss Delmaine?&rdquo; Sir Joseph began quietly, when her carmine lips had hovered over  the Book: &ldquo;from the 7th to the 25th?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was at the Mecca Hotel, in Algiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Colonel Rannock was with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in Corsica and in Sardinia  before that, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also with Colonel Rannock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what capacity were you travelling with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The phrase produced a faint titter, and the younger  of the smart young ladies became suddenly occupied with their muffs and lace handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were travelling as Mr. and Mrs. Randall, if that&rsquo;s  what you want to know!&rdquo; Miss Delmaine replied, with a look that challenged the Court  to think the worst of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is precisely what I want to know. You were going  about with Colonel Rannock as his wife &mdash; under the <i>nom de guerre</i> of Randall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Pray, Miss Delmaine, can you tell me where Colonel  Rannock is at this present time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The witness had given her evidence in an agitated and  angry manner from the beginning. The bloom on her cheeks was hectic, and not rouge,  as the smart young women thought. Her eyes were unnaturally bright, splendid eyes,  that flashed angry fire. She had stood up boldly in her place, defying the world&rsquo;s  contempt; but it seemed as if the effort had been too much for her. She looked distractedly  round the court, turned white as ashes, and fell in a dead faint, before she had  answered the counsel&rsquo;s question, which was irrelevant, and might not have been allowed.</p>
<p>There was the usual rush with glasses of water and smelling-salts,  and the witness was carried out of court.</p>
<p>The Court then adjourned for luncheon. The picture-hats  all waited, sniffed salts and eau de Cologne, nibbled chocolates, hungry, and yawning  for want of air, but determined to see it out.</p>
<p>There was bitter disappointment for the curious impertinents  when, on the judge returning to his seat, Sir Joseph Jalland informed his lordship  that Mr. Brown Smith had offered an ample apology for the offensive article in his  paper, and that his client had no desire to continue the action in a vindictive  manner.</p>
<p>The judge highly approved of this course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Lady Perivale brought this action in order to clear  her character of a most unmerited aspersion, she has been completely successful,  and can afford to be lenient,&rdquo; said his lordship, with feeling.</p>
<p>The defendant was to publish his apology, both in his  own paper and such other papers as Sir Joseph should name. He was to destroy every  number of his paper still unsold, and to call in any numbers remaining in the hands  of the retail trade, and was further to give one hundred guineas to any charitable  institution selected by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Only to Lady Perivale&rsquo;s solicitors and to Mr. Faunce  was it known that the defendant would not be out of pocket either by this hundred  guineas, or for the costs of the action, against which a considerable sum had been  paid into his banking account by Mr. Faunce, before the libel &mdash; written by that  very Faunce, in collaboration with one of the ladies who did the <i>Bon Ton</i> gossip  &mdash; appeared in Mr. Brown Smith&rsquo;s popular journal.</p>
<p>Faunce had said there would be a libel when it was wanted,  and Faunce, who was an old friend of Brown Smith&rsquo;s, had produced the libel. Nobody  was any the worse, and Society was deeply humiliated at discovering how cruelly  it had misjudged a charming member of its own privileged body. Lady Morningside  and her husband made their way to Lady Perivale directly the judge left his seat,  and the old Marquis, with an old-fashioned gallantry that recalled &ldquo;Cupid&rdquo; Palmerston,  bent over Grace&rsquo;s ungloved hand and kissed it: a demonstration that thrilled the  smart hats and eye-glasses.</p>
<p>Cards and letters of friendly congratulation poured  in upon Lady Perivale at Grosvenor    Square that evening &mdash; letters from the people who had  cut her, making believe that the aloofness had been all on her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, dear, after this plucky assertion of yourself,  I hope you are not going to shut yourself from your old friends any more. It has  been so sad to see No. 101 empty all the season, and not even to know where you  were to be found,&rdquo; concluded one of those false friends.</p>
<p>Grace flung the letters into her waste-paper basket  with angry scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think people can dare to pretend they did not know  I was in town, when I drove in the park nearly every day!&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are satisfied, madam,&rdquo; said Faunce, when  he called upon Lady Perivale the day after the trial.</p>
<p>No one had seen Faunce in court, though Faunce had seen  and heard all that happened there. His work had been finished before the case came  on, and the family solicitors in Bedford Row took all the credit of the successful  result, and congratulated Lady Perivale upon their acumen in retaining Sir Joseph  Jalland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are satisfied, madam,&rdquo; Faunce said modestly,  when he called in Grosvenor Square,  in response to Lady Perivale&rsquo;s request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more than satisfied with your cleverness in bringing  the wretched business to an issue,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and now all I hope is that I may  be able to forget it, and that I shall never hear Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s name again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will not, madam &mdash; not in any unpleasant  connection,&rdquo; Faunce answered gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must refer you for your professional charges to my  lawyers, Mr. Faunce,&rdquo; pursued Grace. &ldquo;But I must beg you to accept the enclosed  as a token of my sincere gratitude for the trouble you have taken, and as a souvenir  of your success.&rdquo; She handed him an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you, Lady Perivale, I do not require anything  beyond the ordinary payment for my time and trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but you must take this, to please me,&rdquo; she answered.  &ldquo;I want you to remember that I value your services at more than their professional  price.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her hand at parting, as she had given it  at the end of their first interview, and he thought more of that cordial handshake  than of her present, which he found to be a cheque for &pound;500.</p>
<p>In the third week in December there was a very quiet  wedding at St. George&rsquo;s, Hanover Square, a marriage which was celebrated at half-past  eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and at which the only witnesses were Susan Rodney  and Mr. George Howard, newly returned from Pekin &mdash; a wedding so early and so quiet  as to escape the most invincible of the society paragraphists, the insatiable pens  that had been writing about this very marriage as an imminent event.</p>
<p>The bride&rsquo;s dark-grey cloth gown, sable-bordered travelling-cloak,  and black chip hat offered no suggestion of wedding raiment. The breakfast was a  <i>parti carr&eacute;</i> in the dining-room at Grosvenor Square; and the married lovers were  able to leave Charing Cross at eleven by the Continental Express without provoking  any more notice from the crowd than the appearance of a beautiful woman, perfectly  dressed for the business in hand, and leading the most perfect thing in brown poodles,  must inevitably attract. The honey-mooners were established at their hotel in Cairo before the paragraphists  had wind of the marriage.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But now with lights reverse the old hours retire,<br>
  And the last hour is shod with fire from hell.<br>
This is the end of every man&rsquo;s desire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the four months which had elapsed since Faunce&rsquo;s  first visit to Kate Delmaine, alias Mrs. Randall, the detective had contrived to  keep an observant eye upon the lady; but he had not succeeded in arriving on a more  friendly footing with her, although he had obliged her on several occasions with  a small advance on account of the promised reward.</p>
<p>He had called three or four times at the lodging-house  in the dingy street near the Thames, and she had  received him civilly. He had detected a lurking anxiety under the assumed lightness  of her manner &mdash; a carking care, that seemed to him of some deeper nature than the  need of money, or the sense of having fallen upon evil days. He would not have been  surprised to see her depressed and out of spirits; but he was at a loss to understand  that ever-present anxiety, and that nervous irritability which seemed allied with  fear.</p>
<p>He remarked to her, in a friendly way, on the state  of her nerves, and advised her to see a doctor. He urged her to live well, and to  take the utmost care of herself, to which end he was liberal with those ten-pound  notes on account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to look your best when you appear in court,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;to show that you are every bit as handsome a woman as Lady Perivale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He always said I was,&rdquo; she answered, with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Rannock? He knew and admired you before he  ever saw Lady Perivale, didn&rsquo;t he, now?&rdquo; asked Faunce, who, for reasons of his own,  was very anxious to make her talk of Rannock; but she answered curtly &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether he did or whether he didn&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s no business  of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gloomy look had come back to her face; and Faunce  was more and more convinced that, whatever her anxiety was, it was in some way connected  with Colonel Rannock.</p>
<p>He had brought Rannock&rsquo;s name into the conversation  whenever he could, and with an artful persistence, and the name had always a depressing  influence. She spoke of him reluctantly, and she seldom spoke of him dry-eyed. Once  she spoke of him in a past tense. It could be no common fate that had left such  aching memories.</p>
<p>Without actually &ldquo;shadowing&rdquo; the lady during this interval,  he had contrived to keep acquainted with her movements and associations, and he  had discovered that almost her only visitor was the man whom he had seen on that  first day &mdash; the man who had opened the door, glanced into the room, and hurried  away at sight of a stranger. Even this person was not a frequent visitor, but he  called at irregular hours, which indicated a friendly footing.</p>
<p>It had not taken Faunce very long to identify this person  as an individual well-known to the patrons of the prize-ring &mdash; a pugilist called  Bolisco, who had been one of Sir Hubert Withernsea&rsquo;s <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>, and had often sat  at meat and drink in the very much mixed society in the Abbey Road. Bolisco had been at the zenith  of his renown ten years ago, when Withernsea was burning that brief candle of his  days which had guttered into the grave before he was thirty; but the pugilist&rsquo;s  reputation had considerably declined since then. He had been beaten ignominiously  in three or four public encounters, had seen his star go down before younger and  steadier men, and was no longer good for anything better than a glove-fight at a  second-rate tavern. One of those glove-fights had ended fatally for Bolisco&rsquo;s opponent;  and there had been some among the lookers-on who accused him of brutal roughness  towards a weaker man, which had resulted in death. No blame had attached to Bolisco  in the opinion of the coroner&rsquo;s jury; but the patrons of the Fancy had given him  the cold shoulder since that unlucky accident, which had happened more than a year  ago.</p>
<p>In the course of that semi-shadowing Faunce had found  out some details of Kate Delmaine&rsquo;s life during the last half-year. He found that  she had occupied the shabby first-floor in Selburne Street since the beginning of March,  that she had come there straight from &ldquo;abroad,&rdquo; and that her trunks were covered  with foreign labels &mdash; Ajaccio, Algiers,  Marseilles, Paris,  Calais. She had  arrived with a great load of personal luggage, fine clothes, and other portable  property, the greater part of which had been gradually made away with. She would  go out in a cab with a large cardboard box, and come home half an hour afterwards  on foot, having left box and contents at a pawnbroker&rsquo;s in the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>
<p>Betsy, the sixteen-year-old maid-of-all-work, from whom  Faunce derived most of his information, had been a close observer of the first-floor  lodger, and was pleased to impart her knowledge and her impressions to the amiable  Faunce.</p>
<p>Mrs. Randall was very down-hearted, Betsy told him,  and would sit and cry for the hour together. Did she drink? Well, only a brandy-and-soda  now and then, but she used to stick a needle into her arm that made her sleepy,  and she would lie on the sofa all the afternoon and evening sometimes, like a dead  thing. The girl had heard her moan and groan in her sleep when she took her a cup  of tea in the morning, and she would wake with a frightened look, and stare about  her &ldquo;wild-like,&rdquo; as if she didn&rsquo;t know where she was.</p>
<p>Had she many visitors?</p>
<p>None, except the dark gentleman with the broken nose;  and he did not come very often, or stay long. They had words sometimes &mdash; very high  words &mdash; and once, in one of their quarrels, she went into hysterics, and was &ldquo;regular  bad,&rdquo; and screamed at him like a lunatic. The missus had been obliged to go upstairs  to her, and tell her she wouldn&rsquo;t stand such goings-on any longer. She&rsquo;d have to  clear out if she couldn&rsquo;t behave like a lady.</p>
<p>All this to hear did Mr. Faunce seriously incline; and  he now began to do a little shadowing on Mr. Bolisco&rsquo;s account.</p>
<p>He knew that in all probability he was wasting his time;  but the old hunter&rsquo;s instinct of the Scotland Yard days was upon him, and he wanted  to know what ailed Kate Delmaine over and above the natural depression of a woman  of her class out of luck.</p>
<p>He had provided for her comfort, had been to her as  a guardian angel, as the time for her appearance in Court drew near. He had advised  her how to dress the part, and had ascertained what Lady Perivale was going to wear,  in order that Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s costume should in some degree resemble hers. He had  gone to Regent Street  on the day before the case came on, and bought a fur toque, after the fashion of  Lady Perivale&rsquo;s sable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only a paltry bit of skunk,&rdquo; Mrs. Randall declared  contemptuously, after she had blown the fur about and examined it with a depreciatory  scrutiny; but when she put it on before the cloudy looking-glass in her parlour  she owned to being pleased with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you believe I was once a handsome woman,&rdquo;  she said to Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are a handsome woman now, and that you&rsquo;ve  only to take a little more care of yourself to be as handsome as ever you were,&rdquo;  he answered gravely, being a kind-hearted man and really sorry for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s skittles!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to the end  of my tether. I&rsquo;ve nothing to live for, and I&rsquo;m sick of wishing I was dead, for  it don&rsquo;t come off. And I don&rsquo;t want to kill myself; that&rsquo;s too cheap. I hate the  idea of an inquest, and &lsquo;The deceased was once known as this,&rsquo; and &lsquo;The deceased  was once t&rsquo;other.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m a lady, Mr. Faunce, and I loathe being magged about in the  newspapers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that Lady Perivale&rsquo;s action had ceased to be a nine  days&rsquo; wonder, and the lady herself was a happy wife, travelling by easy stages towards  the land of ancient monuments and modern amusements, pyramids and golf links, Sphinxes  and croquet, colossal sepulchres of unknown Pharaohs, and monster hotels with unknown  tariffs; now that he had accomplished his task and had been handsomely rewarded,  it might seem that John Faunce&rsquo;s interest in Grace Perivale&rsquo;s double would cease  and determine. Strange to say that interest grew rather than diminished, and he  contrived to see his little friend, the lodging-house slavey, once or twice a week,  and so to be informed of all Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s proceedings; indeed, his love of detail  led him to ask Betsy for an old blotting-book of the first-floor lodger&rsquo;s, which  had been flung upon the dustheap, and which the girl had retrieved from that foul  receptacle for the sake of its picture cover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people collect something,&rdquo; he told Betsy; &ldquo;my  fancy is old blotting-paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never did!&rdquo; exclaimed the damsel. &ldquo;I know many  as collecks postage-stamps, but I never heerd as blotting-paper was valuable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, Betsy &mdash; sometimes,&rdquo; in token of which Mr. Faunce  gave her a crown piece for the ragged book, with its inky impress of Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s  sprawling penmanship.</p>
<p>Faunce had paid his witness the balance of the promised  reward, &pound;120, in bank-notes, the evening after the trial, and he was prepared to  hear she had taken wing.</p>
<p>Surely with a sum of money in hand she would leave that  dismal street, and hurry away to some more attractive locality. To Paris, perhaps, to buy fine clothes, and flaunt her recovered  beauty in the Bois; or to Monte Carlo,  to try her luck at the tables. It was in the character of such a woman to squander  her last hundred pounds as freely as if she had an unlimited capital behind it.</p>
<p>She had talked of leaving her lodgings, the little handmaiden  Betsy told him, but it hadn&rsquo;t come off. She had given a week&rsquo;s notice, and then  had cut up rough when the missus took a lady and gentleman to look at the rooms.  She wasn&rsquo;t going to be chucked out like a stray dog, she&rsquo;d go when she wanted, and  not before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll never go,&rdquo; Betsy said, with  a wise air. &ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t got it in her to make up her mind about nothink. She sits  in the easy-chair all day, smokin&rsquo; cigarettes and readin&rsquo; a novel, or lays on the  sofa, and seems only half awake. And of a evening she gets dreadful low. She says  she hates the house, and won&rsquo;t sleep another night in it, and yet when morning comes  she don&rsquo;t offer to go. And then, she&rsquo;s that under his thumb that if he say she&rsquo;s  not to leave, go she won&rsquo;t&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the dark gentleman?&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. There ain&rsquo;t any other as I knows on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she is &mdash; attached &mdash; to the dark gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know she&rsquo;s afraid of him. I&rsquo;ve seen her turn white  at his step on the stairs, and she&rsquo;s always upset after he&rsquo;s been to our place,  and sits and cries as if her heart was breaking. There, I do feel sorry for her!  She&rsquo;s a real good sort. She give me this here hat,&rdquo; added the slavey, tossing her  beplumed and bejewelled head. &ldquo;It was bought in the Harcade, and it ain&rsquo;t been worn  above half a dozen times, only the sea-water damaged it a bit when she was travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So sincere and deep-rooted was Faunce&rsquo;s interest in  Mrs. Randall, that he took considerable pains to follow the movements of her friend  Mr. Bolisco, whom he tracked to his lair in a sporting public-house at Battersea  &mdash; an old, tumble-down building in a shabby street close to the river, a house that  had once been a respectable roadside inn, and had once been in the country.</p>
<p>Faunce took some note of the famous prizefighter&rsquo;s habits,  which were idle and dissolute, and of his associates, who belonged to the lowest  order, the ragged fringe of rascality that hangs upon the edge of the sporting world.  It was sad to think that so disreputable an acquaintance could dominate the life  of a fine, high-spirited creature like Kate Delmaine. But, much as he was interested  in a beautiful woman, who was travelling on that dismal journey which is called  &ldquo;going to the dogs,&rdquo; Mr. Faunce felt that his evening walks with Betsy, and his  occasional look in at the Gamecock at Battersea &mdash; that sporting rendezvous where  Mr. Bolisco had his &ldquo;diggings,&rdquo; &mdash; were so much dilettante trifling, and mere waste  of time. His work in relation to Kate Delmaine was finished; and whatever mystery  there might be in her life, mystery involving even a crime, it was no business of  his to investigate it.</p>
<p>Somewhat reluctantly, therefore, like a baffled hunter  who turns from the dubious trail of the beast he has been pursuing, Mr. Faunce discontinued  his visits to Chelsea, and went no more, in his character  of a well-to-do idler interested in the prize-ring, to the public-house across Battersea Bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be getting a regular amateur,&rdquo; he told himself,  &ldquo;if I can&rsquo;t have done with a case when my work is finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christmas came as a pleasant diversion, and during that  jovial season Faunce deserted his rooms in Essex Street, forgot that he was a detective,  and remembered that he was a citizen and a husband. The turkey and beef, the pudding  and mince-pies did credit to Mrs. Faunce&rsquo;s judgment, and the skill of an unpretentious  cook, who did not scorn to bare her robust arms to the elbow, and hearthstone the  doorstep before she fried the morning rasher.</p>
<p>The catering had been Mr. Faunce&rsquo;s own work. It was  his falcon glance that had detected the finest Norfolk  turkey in a row of eighteen-pounders, the ripest York ham out of a score of good ones. The champagne  which he bought for his guests, the ten-year-old Scotch whisky which he drank himself,  were all of the best, and the villa at Putney had the air of plenteous comfort in  a small space which pervades a well-found ship.</p>
<p>With his wife sitting opposite to him, and an old friend  on either side, Faunce enjoyed the harmless pleasures of social intercourse, and  cleared his mind of crime and mystery, and did not go back to his office in Essex Street until the  general holiday was over, and the flavour of Christmas had faded out of the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was on the day after his return to everyday life  that Faunce received a message from Scotland Yard, bidding him go there immediately  on important business, a summons that he made haste to obey, since many of those  cases which had afforded him profitable occupation within the last few years had  come to him by the recommendation of his old chiefs in the Criminal Investigation  Department.</p>
<p>He found one of those chiefs seated in his private room,  engaged in conversation with a short, stout gentleman of middle age and pleasing  countenance, who looked like a soldier &mdash; fairhaired, intelligent, and fussy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Faunce, Major Towgood,&rdquo; said the chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted to make your acquaintance, Faunce!&rdquo; exclaimed  the Major, in a breathless way, bouncing up from his chair, wanting to shake hands  with Faunce, and suppressing the desire with a backward jerk; &ldquo;and if Mr. Faunce,&rdquo;  turning to the chief, &ldquo;can do anything to set my poor mother-in-law&rsquo;s mind at rest  about that scapegrace of hers, I shall be very grateful &mdash; on my wife&rsquo;s account,  don&rsquo;t you know. Personally, I shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry to know he had gone under for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major Towgood is interested in the fate of a Colonel  Rannock, his connection by marriage, who has not been heard of for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since last March, early in the month &mdash; sold his  sticks &mdash; and started for the Yukon River,&rdquo; interjected  Major Towgood again breathlessly, and with his eyes opened very wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s disappearance &mdash; if it can be called  a disappearance &mdash; has caused considerable anxiety to his widowed mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are such forgiving creatures, don&rsquo;t you know,&rdquo;  interrupted the Major. &ldquo;Talk of seventy times seven! There ain&rsquo;t any combination  of figures that will express a mother&rsquo;s forgiveness of a prodigal son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I have told Major Towgood,&rdquo; pursued the chief,  with a shade of weariness, &ldquo;that I can highly recommend you for an inquiry of that  sort, and that if Colonel Rannock is to be found above ground &mdash; or under ground  &mdash; you will find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my best, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, my dear Towgood, I don&rsquo;t think I can do any  more for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Major Towgood jumped up and bustled towards the door.  But he wasn&rsquo;t gone yet. His gratitude was overpowering; and the chief had to back  him out of the room, politely, but decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just the man we want, Faunce,&rdquo; said the Major,  as they walked down a long corridor that led to the staircase. &ldquo;Your Chief has told  me all about you &mdash; you were in the Bank of England case, he said, and the Lady Kingsbury  case &mdash; and &mdash; ever so many more sensation trials &mdash; and now you&rsquo;re on your own hook  &mdash; which just suits us. The Chief and I were at Sandhurst  together, don&rsquo;t you know, and he&rsquo;d do anything for me. But he&rsquo;s a busy man, a very  busy man; and I always respect a man&rsquo;s business, pull myself up short, don&rsquo;t you  know, wouldn&rsquo;t waste his time or bore him, on any account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They haven&rsquo;t much time to spare in this building, sir,&rdquo;  assented Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. Magnificent building &mdash; splendid institution  &mdash; fine body of men the police &mdash; but there ought to be three times as many of &rsquo;em.  Eh, Faunce, that&rsquo;s your opinion, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt, sir, there ought to be more of them, if it  would run to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t, no, of course it won&rsquo;t. Another penny  on the income-tax this year! We shall see it a shilling before we&rsquo;ve done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should see it half a crown, sir, if everything  was done as it ought to be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, true, Faunce. A social Utopia, and the taxpayer  with hardly bread to eat. Well, I want to take you straight to my mother-in-law,  who will tell you all about her worthless son &mdash; a bad egg, Faunce, a bitter bad  egg, and not worth a ha&rsquo;porth of the anxiety that poor old lady has been feeling  about him. She lives at Buckingham Gate. Shall we walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means, sir. May I ask what particular circumstances  have caused this uneasiness on Mrs. Rannock&rsquo;s part &mdash; and from what period her anxiety  dates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you see, Faunce, Rannock left England in March  &mdash; late in March &mdash; to go to Klondyke &mdash; a wild-cat scheme, like most of his schemes  &mdash; and from that day to this nobody who knows him &mdash; so far as we can discover &mdash; has  received any communication from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so strange, sir? I shouldn&rsquo;t think that when  a man was digging for gold among a few thousand other adventurers, at the risk of  being frozen to death, or murdered if he was lucky, he would be likely to trouble  himself much about family correspondence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no doubt it&rsquo;s a rough-and-tumble life, but still,  I&rsquo;m told they do get the mails, and do keep somehow in touch with the civilized  world; and, blackguard as Rannock is, he has been in the habit of writing to his  mother three or four times a year, and oftener. I believe there is a soft spot in  his heart for her. But you&rsquo;ll see the old lady, and she&rsquo;ll tell you her troubles,&rdquo;  concluded Major Towgood, &ldquo;so I needn&rsquo;t say any more about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of which remark he talked without intermission  all the way to Buckingham Gate.</p>
<h2 align="center" class="note"><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Happy he<br>
  With such a mother! faith in womankind<br>
  Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high<br>
  Comes easy to him, and tho&rsquo; he trip and fall<br>
  He shall not blind his soul with clay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Honourable Mrs. Rannock, widow of Captain Rannock,  second son of Lord Kirkmichael, lived in a narrow-fronted Queen Anne house facing  Wellington Barracks. It was one of the smallest houses to be found in a fashionable  quarter, and the rent was the only thing big about it; but Mrs. Rannock had lived  at Court for the greater part of her life, having begun as a maid-of-honour when  she and her Royal mistress were young, and she could hardly have existed out of  that rarefied atmosphere. Refinement and elegance were as necessary to her as air  and water are to the common herd; she would have pined to death in a vulgar neighbourhood;  her personal wants were of the smallest, but her surroundings had to be the surroundings  of a lady.</p>
<p>Everything in the house was perfect of its kind. It  was furnished with family relics, Sheraton and Chippendale furniture that had been  made to order by those famous cabinetmakers for the Rannocks of the eighteenth century,  a buhl cabinet that had come straight from the Faubourg St. Germain in the Red Terror,  when Paris was running with innocent blood, and the <i>ci-devants</i> were flying from  ruin and death.</p>
<p>The street door was painted sky-blue, the hall and staircase  were white, the rich colouring of the wall-papers made a vivid background to the  sober tones of the old furniture, and in the dainty drawing-room, with its apple-blossom  chintz and exquisite Chelsea china, the daintiest thing was old Mrs. Rannock, with  her pink-and-white complexion, silvery hair, patrician features and bearing, tall  and slender figure, rich brocade gown, and Honiton cap with lappets that fell almost  to her waist.</p>
<p>She was an ideal old lady, <i>grande dame</i> in every detail.  She had been painted by Hayter and sketched by D&rsquo;Orsay. The semi-transparent hand,  which lay on the arm of her chair, had been modelled by sculptors of renown, had  been carved in marble and in ivory, when she was the beautiful Mary Rannock.</p>
<p>She was nearly eighty, and had been a widow for a quarter  of a century, drifting placidly down the river of time, with very few pleasures  and not many friends, having outlived most of them, and with only one trouble, the  wrong-doing of the son she adored.</p>
<p>She had hoped so much for him, had burnt with ambition  for him, had destined him for a high place in the world; and he had forfeited every  friendship, missed every chance, disappointed every hope. And she loved him still,  better than she loved her daughter and her daughter&rsquo;s children; better, perhaps,  because his life had been an ignominious failure; better because of that boundless  compassion which she felt for his ill-fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Dick has never had any luck,&rdquo; she would say  excusingly.</p>
<p>She received Mr. Faunce with pathetic eagerness, like  a drowning man clutching at the first spar that floats within his reach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, be seated,&rdquo; she said graciously. And then, turning  to her son-in-law, she said, &ldquo;I should like to have my talk with Mr. Faunce quite  alone, Harry,&rdquo; at which Major Towgood bounded from his chair with a snort of vexation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely, my dear mother, since I know all the circumstances  of the case, and as a man of the world, I can be of some use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not while I am talking to Mr. Faunce, Harry. I want  to keep my poor old head calm and cool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dear, you are the best judge, but really &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Harry, it will be so kind of you to leave us  alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mother, if that&rsquo;s so &mdash;&rdquo; and the impetuous  little Major puffed and blew himself out of the room, and might have been heard  fuming on the landing, before he went downstairs to console himself with a cigar  in the dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son-in-law is an excellent creature, Mr. Faunce,  but he talks too much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Rannock. &ldquo;No doubt he has told you something of  the circumstances in which I require your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now ask me as many questions as you like. I will  keep nothing from you. I am too anxious about my son&rsquo;s fate to have any reserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask, madam, in the first place, what reason you  have for being anxious about Colonel Rannock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His silence is a sufficient reason &mdash; his silence of  nearly ten months. My son is a very good correspondent. I don&rsquo;t think he has ever  before left me two months without a letter. He is a very good correspondent,&rdquo; she  repeated earnestly, as if she were saying, &ldquo;He is a very good son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you allowed for the rough life at Klondyke,  madam, and the disinclination that a man feels &mdash; in a scene of that kind &mdash; to sit  down and write a letter, dead beat, perhaps, after a day&rsquo;s toil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have allowed for that, but I cannot believe  &mdash; if my son were living&rdquo; &mdash; her eyes filled with irrepressible tears in spite of  her struggle to be calm&mdash;&ldquo;and in his right mind, with power to hold a pen &mdash; I cannot  believe that he would so neglect me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have written to him, I conclude, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have written week after week. I have sent letters  to the Post Office at San Francisco and at Dawson City,  where my son told me to address him &mdash; letter after letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you communicated with Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s late body-servant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chater? Yes, naturally. What do you know of Chater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, madam. I happened to hear of him from  a gentleman who had also been making inquiries about your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo; For what reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Lady Perivale&rsquo;s interest. The gentleman has since  married Lady Perivale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Haldane! Yes, I heard of the marriage. I was glad  to hear of it. Lady Perivale had suffered a great injustice from her likeness to  that wretched woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, madam. You know the saying &mdash; <i>Cherchez la  femme</i>. If you can tell me anything about that woman, and Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s relations  with her, it may help me in my search for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it is a sad, sad story. My dear son began life  so well, in his grandfather&rsquo;s regiment. There had been Rannocks in the Lanarkshire  ever since Killicrankie. He was a fine soldier, and distinguished himself in Afghanistan,  and it was only after he made that wretched woman&rsquo;s acquaintance that he began to  go wrong &mdash; seriously wrong. He may have been a little wild even before then, but  not more than many other young men. It was that woman and her surroundings that  ruined him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take it that happened about ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years? Yes. How did you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had occasion  to look into Miss Delmaine&rsquo;s past life, madam. Pray tell me all you can about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an infatuation on my son&rsquo;s part. He saw her  at the theatre, where people made a great fuss about her on account of her beauty,  though she was no actress. She had a fine house in St. John&rsquo;s Wood, at the expense of a young man  of large means &mdash; whom she ruined, and who died soon after. My son became a frequent  visitor at the house. There were Sunday dinners, and suppers after the theatre,  and my son was always there, madly in love with Miss Delmaine. Whether she was more  to him than an acquaintance in those days I cannot say. Certainly he had no quarrel  with Sir Hubert Withernsea. But after that unhappy young man&rsquo;s death Kate Delmaine&rsquo;s  influence upon my son wrecked his career. He left the Army when the Lanarkshire  was ordered to Burmah, rather than leave her, and not daring to take her with him.  I don&rsquo;t know what kind of life he lived after that, although I saw him from time  to time; but I know he was under a cloud, and there were only a few of his father&rsquo;s  old friends who were civil to him, and asked him to their houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know of Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s courtship of Lady  Perivale, madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. It was my earnest hope that he would succeed  in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the lady, and know of her likeness to  Miss Delmaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I go very little into society. I am an old woman,  and only like to see old friends. And you must understand that I never saw Miss  Delmaine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think your son was in love with Lady Perivale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe he was. Or it may be that he only liked  her because of her resemblance to that woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was he very angry when she refused him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know he was wounded &mdash; and even angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that disappointment, and other troubles,  might have induced him to take his own life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no; I couldn&rsquo;t believe that for one moment.  My son has faced death too often &mdash; has risked his life in a good cause, and would  never throw it away like a coward. I know how brave he is, what a strong will he  has &mdash; a will strong enough to overcome difficulties. It was like him to think of  Klondyke when he was ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that he was in Algiers with Miss Delmaine last February?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not till I read the report of Lady Perivale&rsquo;s libel  suit. I thought he had broken with her finally two years ago, and I believe at the  time he had. I need not tell you that I did not obtain my knowledge of that unhappy  connection from my son himself. You will understand a mother&rsquo;s keen anxiety, and  that I had other sources of information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, I can understand. I do not think I need  give you any further trouble today; but if you will oblige me with your son&rsquo;s photograph&mdash;a recent likeness&mdash;it may be of use in this matter.&quot;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can give you his photograph, taken last
  year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>  Mrs. Rannock opened a velvet case on the table
  next her chair, and the wasted white hands trembled ever so faintly as she took out a cabinet photograph and
  gave it to Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank-you, madam. I shall wait upon you again
  directly I have any fresh information; but I must warn
  you that an inquiry of this kind is apt to be very slow;
  and I fear you can give me no suggestion as to where
  to look for Colonel Rannock in the event of his having
changed his mind and not gone to Klondyke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I cannot think that he would change his
  mind. He was with me the day before he started, full
  of hope and excitement. He was enthusiastic about the
  wild life in Alaska, and would not listen to my fears and
  objections.. Oh! Mr. Faunce, if anything evil has
  happened to him, these grey hairs will go down in
sorrow to the grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again  the uncontrollable tears welled into her eyes. She rose, and Faunce took the movement  as his dismissal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may rely upon my most earnest endeavours, madam,&rdquo;  he said, and quietly withdrew, as she stretched a trembling hand to the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor soul! I&rsquo;m afraid there must be sorrow for those  grey hairs before we come to the end of the story,&rdquo; mused Faunce, as he walked back  to his rooms.</p>
<p>He wrote to Chater, the valet, asking him to call in  Essex Street next morning on particular business concerning Colonel Rannock; and  the valet appeared, with exact punctuality, neatly clad, with well-brushed hat and  slim umbrella, and a little look about the clean-shaved chin, broad chest, and close-cut  hair, that told Faunce he had once shouldered arms, and swung round to the &ldquo;Right  turn!&rdquo; in the white dust of a barrack-yard.</p>
<p>Chater was eminently a man of the world, very easy to  get on with, when he had heard Faunce&rsquo;s credentials, and knew what was wanted of  him, in Mrs. Rannock&rsquo;s interests. He had been Rannock&rsquo;s soldier-servant in Afghanistan,  and had lived with him between eleven and twelve years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think you liked him,&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; I liked my master. He was a devil, but he  was the kind of devil I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you knew Miss Delmaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help that, sir. She was a devil, and the kind  of devil I don&rsquo;t like. She was the ruin of my master &mdash; blue ruin, Mr. Faunce. He  might have kept inside the ropes but for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know anything of his courtship of Lady Perivale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I did, sir. I had to carry the &rsquo;cello backwards  and forwards between the Albany  and Grosvenor Square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he cared much for Lady Perivale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I believe he did, in a way. He was cuts with  Miss Delmaine just then. She&rsquo;d been going on a little too bad. There was a prize-fighter,  a man she&rsquo;d known from her childhood, that was always after her, and the Colonel  wouldn&rsquo;t stand it. Mind you, I don&rsquo;t believe &mdash; to give the devil his due &mdash; she ever  cared for the fellow, but I think she liked making my master jealous. She is that  kind of aggravating creature that knows her power over a man, and can&rsquo;t be happy  until she&rsquo;s made him miserable. And then there were rows, and a regular burst up,  and the Colonel swore he&rsquo;d never see her again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was after the quarrel that he courted Lady Perivale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was after. He was knocked all of a heap the  first time he met her ladyship, on account of her likeness to Kate. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s the loveliest  woman I ever saw since Mrs. Randall was at her best,&rsquo; he said, for he was always  free with me, having lived under canvas together, and me nursing him through more  than one bout of Indian fever&mdash;&lsquo;and she&rsquo;s an oof-bird,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I shall be  on the pig&rsquo;s back if I marry her.&rsquo; And I know he meant to marry her, and tried hard  &mdash; left off cards and drink, and cut all the young fools that he used to have hanging  about him, and turned over a new leaf. I&rsquo;d never known him keep steady so long since  we came from India.  But when he found it was all no go, and Lady Perivale wouldn&rsquo;t have him, he was  furious. And when she went off to Italy  in the autumn, he took to the cards again, and drank harder than ever, and went  a mucker one way and another, and by December he had made it up with Kate, and they  went off to Nice together the week before Christmas, with the intention of crossing  over to Ajaccio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you go with your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had business to do for him in town. He wanted to  get rid of his chambers and furniture, and I had to find a purchaser, and he wanted  it all carried through very quietly, for there was a money-lender who thought he  had a bill of sale on the goods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You succeeded in that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I got him a fair price for his lease and furniture.  I would give a good deal to know where he is, and what became of that money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six hundred and forty pounds. Three hundred for the  lease, which had only two years to run, and three hundred and forty for the furniture,  at a valuation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he take all the money with him when he started  for America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he paid me half a year&rsquo;s wages, on account of a  year and a half due, and he spent a little on himself, but he had five hundred and  fifty pounds in his pocket-book, in bank-notes, when he left Waterloo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In bank-notes. Do you know the figures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; there were two hundred-pound notes, and four fifties,  the rest tens and fives. I wrote a list of the numbers at his dictation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you kept that list?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have a copy of it among my papers. I copied  the figures, knowing what a careless beggar the Colonel is, and that he was as likely  as not to lose his list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he take the money in bank-notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been told that a cheque-book wouldn&rsquo;t be of  much use to him in San Francisco, and no use at all at Dawson City, where he would  have to buy most of his outfit &mdash; furs, and mining tools, and a lot more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What put Klondyke into his head, do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pal of his, a Yankee, was going to try his luck there.  My master was always fond of adventure, and never minded roughing it; so the scheme  took his fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chater,&rdquo; said Faunce, in a very earnest voice, &ldquo;do you  think Colonel Rannock ever got as far as Klondyke? &mdash; as far as Dawson City?  &mdash; as far as &rsquo;Frisco? &mdash; as far as New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows, sir! I think the case looks &mdash; fishy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to know that he wasn&rsquo;t at &rsquo;Frisco in  time to start for Vancouver  with the pal you talk of, Mr. Bamford &mdash; and that Bamford and another friend sailed  without him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that, sir. Mr. Haldane, the gentleman who came  to me for information, told me the result of his inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this made you rather uneasy, didn&rsquo;t it, Chater?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t like to hear it, Mr. Faunce. But my  master is a rum sort. He might change his mind at the last minute. He might go back  to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t do that, Chater. I can answer for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good deal. Was she at Waterloo to see your master off by the boat-train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not she! They had one of their quarrels in Paris &mdash; and he left her there  to find her way home by herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say home? Had she any house in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she&rsquo;d never owned a house since the Abbey Road. She was  in lodgings near Cheyne Walk before she went to Nice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decent lodgings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, topping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she didn&rsquo;t show up at the boat train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t  travel by the boat-train. He went the night before &mdash; by the Bournemouth  express.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The four-fifty-five?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he going to stay in Southampton  that night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. He didn&rsquo;t tell me what was up. He seemed  a bit excited and put out, and hadn&rsquo;t a word to throw at a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he promise to write to you from America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was to write to me directly he landed. He had  instructions to give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any Southampton  friends of Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I do. He has had yachting pals there sometimes  in summer, but there wouldn&rsquo;t be any of that sort in March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rannock is alarmed at being without letters from  her son since last March. Do you consider that an alarming circumstance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Faunce, I do. My master was fond of his mother,  in his way. He didn&rsquo;t mind victimizing her to the extent of her last sovereign,  poor old lady, when he was hard pushed; but he was attached to her, in his way.  And I don&rsquo;t think he would have made her unhappy by not writing to her, if it had  been in his power to write. I give him that much credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Chater, we shall have to set the cable at work,  and find out what we can at Dawson   City. And now tell me your  opinion of Mrs. Randall, alias Delmaine. You describe her as a bit of a shrew; but  do you know if she was really attached to the Colonel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe she worshipped him, in her way. I &mdash; well,  a letter she wrote him after their worst quarrel &mdash; the row that parted them for  over two years &mdash; forced itself on my attention &mdash; happening to take it up in a casual  way &mdash; and I must say it was a letter to melt a stone; but it came just when the  Colonel was going all he knew for Lady Perivale, and he took no notice of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And two years after he went back to her. That was weak,  wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it was, sir. But, after being much with a  stuck-up person like Lady Perivale, a spirited, free and easy creature like Kate  Delmaine would exercise a fascination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think she ever played him false? You  don&rsquo;t think she cared for the prizefighter? What was his name, by-the-by; Bolisco,  wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, Jim Bolisco. No, she never cared a straw  for him &mdash; a great ugly brute, with a cockeye. She&rsquo;d known him when she was a child  &mdash; for her people were very low &mdash; father kept a small public out Battersea way; and  it ain&rsquo;t easy for a woman to shake off that sort of friend. Bolisco was took up  by Sir Hubert Withernsea, and used to dine at the Abbey Road sometimes, much to the Colonel&rsquo;s  disgust. No, I don&rsquo;t believe Kate ever had the slightest liking for that man; but  I sometimes used to fancy she was afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Later or sooner by a minute then,<br>
  So much for the untimeliness of death, &mdash; <br>
  And as regards the manner that offends,<br>
  That rude and rough, I count the same for gain &mdash; <br>
  Be the act harsh and quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His interview with Chater left John Faunce troubled  in mind, and deeply meditative. Had there been a crime, or was the disappearance  of Colonel Rannock a fact easily accounted for in the natural course of events?  The mother&rsquo;s conviction that some evil had befallen him was after all founded on  an inadequate reason. If he had gone to Klondyke, as he intended, the whole fabric  of his life would have been changed, and the man who while in the civilized world  corresponded regularly with his mother, might well forget his filial duty, in the  daily toil and hourly dangers, hopes, and disappointments of the struggle for gold,  It was difficult to judge a man so placed by previous experience or everyday rules.  The most dutiful son might well leave home letters unwritten; or a letter, trusted  to a casual hand, might easily go astray.</p>
<p>Then there was always the possibility that he had changed  his plans; that he had stayed in New York or in San Francisco; that he had chosen  some other portion of the wild West for his hunting ground; that he had spent the  summer fishing in Canada, or the autumn shooting in the Alleghanies; and, again,  that his letters to England had been lost in transit.</p>
<p>Faunce would not have been disposed to suspect foul  play on so slight a ground as the absence of news from the wanderer, but there had  been that in Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s manner and countenance which had excited his darkest  suspicions, and which had been the cause of his undiminished interest in her proceedings.</p>
<p>If there had been a crime she knew of it, had been in  it, perhaps. He had watched her and studied her, but he had never questioned her.  The time was not ripe for questioning. He did not want to alarm her by the lightest  hint of his suspicions. She was too important a factor in the mystery.</p>
<p>He called on her on the evening after his interview  with Chater, and persuaded her to go to a theatre with him. It was the first time  he had assumed the attitude of established friendship, but although she seemed surprised  at the invitation, she accepted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to get out of this hole for a few hours,&rdquo;  she said, with an impatient sigh, as she pinned on her hat before the glass over  the mantelpiece, the little fur toque in which she had charmed the jury.</p>
<p>Faunce took her to see a musical comedy, a roaring farce  from start to finish, in which the most popular low comedian in London gave a free rein to  his eccentricities; and he watched his companion&rsquo;s face from time to time while  the auditorium rocked with laughter at the wild fun. Not a smile illumined that  gloomy countenance. He could see that she was hardly conscious of the scene, at  which she stared with fixed melancholy eyes. Once she looked round at the people  near her, with a dazed expression, as if she wondered why they were laughing.</p>
<p>It is recorded of the first Napoleon that he once sat  through a broad farce with an unchanged countenance; but then his shoulders bore  the burden of empire, the lives and fortunes of myriads.</p>
<p>The experience of this evening went far to confirm Faunce&rsquo;s  ideas. He took Mrs. Randall to an oyster shop, and gave her some supper, and then  put her into a cab and sent her back to Selburne Street.</p>
<p>Just at the last, when he had paid the cabman and given  her the man&rsquo;s ticket, her face lighted up for a moment with a forced smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you no end for a jolly evening,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it hasn&rsquo;t been very jolly for you, Mrs.  Randall. You didn&rsquo;t seem amused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m up to that sort of trash now,  I had too much of it when I was on the boards. And the more comic the show is, the  more I get thinking of other things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t think too much; it&rsquo;ll spoil your beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or, if it ain&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t  care. I&rsquo;d as leave be a nigger as a &lsquo;has been,&rsquo; any day. Good night. Come and see  me soon; and perhaps, if you take me to a tragedy next time, I may laugh,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something bitter bad behind that,&rdquo; mused Faunce,  as he tramped across the bridge to Waterloo Station for the last Putney train, &ldquo;but,  for all that, I can&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s a murderess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce spent the next morning in his den in Essex Street  poring over a book to which he had frequent recourse, and of which he was justly  proud, since it was the wife of his bosom who had compiled this register of passing  events for his study and use, a labour of love on her part, achieved with abnormal  slowness, and kept closely up to date. The book was carried home to Putney on the  first of every month, and Mrs. Faunce&rsquo;s careful hands added such paragraphs bearing  on the scheme of the work, as she had cut out of the newspapers during the previous  four weeks.</p>
<p>It had pleased this good helpmeet to think that she  was assisting her husband in his professional labours, and the gruesome nature of  her researches had never troubled her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Faunce&rsquo;s book was a large folio bound in red levant  leather, and containing newspaper cuttings, pasted in by the lady&rsquo;s careful hands,  and indexed and classified with neatness and intelligence.</p>
<p>The volume was labelled &ldquo;Not accounted for,&rdquo; and was  a record of exceeding ghastliness.</p>
<p>It contained the reports of coroners&rsquo; inquests upon  all manner of mysterious deaths, the unexplained cases which might have been murder,  the &ldquo;found drowned,&rdquo; the nameless corpses discovered in empty houses, in lodging-house  garrets, on desolate heaths and waste places; a dismal calendar of tragic destinies,  the record of hard fate or of undiscovered crime.</p>
<p>Steadily, carefully, John Faunce searched the spacious  pages where the scraps of newspaper type stood out against a broad margin of white  paper. He began his scrutiny at the date on which Colonel Rannock was said to have  left London, and pursued it without finding any fact  worth his attention till he came to a paragraph dated May 30, and extracted from  the <i>Hants Mercury</i>, a popular bi-weekly newspaper, published in Southampton.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;STRANGE DISCOVERY AT REDBRIDGE. &mdash; An inquest was held  yesterday afternoon at the Royal George, Redbridge, on the body of a man, which  had been found the previous day by some workmen engaged on the repair of the road  by the river. Their attention was attracted by the proceedings of some gulls that  were hovering and screaming over a discarded boat that lay keel upwards in the slime  and weeds of the foreshore, at a spot where the tide must have washed over it day  by day. The timbers were so rotten that they crumbled under &lsquo;the men&rsquo;s hands as  they tried to lift the boat; but worthless as it was, they found it carefully secured  with two strong stakes which had been thrust between the timbers at stern and bow,  and driven deep into the beach below the soft ooze and shifting mud that moved with  every tide.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The men pulled up the stakes and turned the keel over,  and, almost buried in the mud, they found the body of a man which had evidently  been lying there for a long time, and of which even the clothing was so decomposed  as to be unrecognizable. The most careful scrutiny failed to afford any indication  of identity, except the name of a well-known West End  tailor on the trousers-buttons, and the fact that the unknown had been tall and  strongly built. The doctor&rsquo;s evidence showed that the back of the skull had been  fractured by some blunt instrument, and by a single blow of extraordinary violence.  Death must have been almost instantaneous. The inquiry was adjourned in the hope  of further evidence transpiring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other notices followed at short intervals, but no further  evidence had &ldquo;transpired.&rdquo; A verdict of murder by some person or persons unknown  had ended the inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; mused Faunce, after reading the report a  second time, and with profound attention, and then he went on with his book till  he came to the last extract from a recent paper, another unknown victim of an unknown  murderer, pasted on to the page a week ago. And of all those unsavoury records there  was only that one of the body hidden under the discarded boat that engaged his attention.</p>
<p>He knew Redbridge, a village street with its back to  the water, a few scattered houses along the shore, a homely inn, a bridge, and for  the rest a swampy waste where the reeds grew tall and rank, and the wild duck skimmed.  He knew the solitude that could be found along that shore, not a quarter of a mile  from pleasant cottage houses, and lamplit village shops, and, the gossip and movement  of the inn. A likely spot for a murderer to hide his victim; and this was clearly  a case of murder, the stealthy murderer&rsquo;s sudden blow, creeping noiselessly behind  the doomed man&rsquo;s back, with the strong arm lifted ready to strike.</p>
<p>That single blow of great violence indicated the murderer&rsquo;s  strength. But where and how had the blow been dealt, and what connection could there  be between Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s supposed departure from Southampton, and the body found  on the shore at Red bridge, four miles away?</p>
<p>The question was one which John Faunce told himself  that he had to answer. The answer, when arrived at, might have no bearing on the  case in hand, but it had to be found. Faunce&rsquo;s science was an inductive science,  and he was always asking himself apparently futile questions and working hard at  the answers.</p>
<p>Mr. Faunce spent the evening in his snug little sitting-room  at Putney, and his sole recreation during those domestic hours was furnished by  Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s discarded blotting-book, which he had not examined since he obtained  it from the little servant in Selburne    Street.</p>
<p>With a clear table and a strong duplex lamp in front  of him, Faunce took the leaves of blotting-paper one by one, and held them between  his eyes and the light, while Mrs. Faunce, reading a novel in her armchair by the  fire, looked up at him every now and then with an indulgent smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your old blotting-paper work again, Faunce,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t fancy you&rsquo;ll get much information out of that ragged stuff. There&rsquo;s  too much ink, and too many blots and splotches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a very good specimen, Nancy; but I suppose  I shall come to something before I&rsquo;ve done. It&rsquo;s finnicking work; but it almost  always pays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re so persevering; and then you love your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t I should never have stuck to it, Nancy. It&rsquo;s rather trying work  for any man that hasn&rsquo;t a heart like the nether millstone; and I&rsquo;m afraid I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce had been at work nearly two hours, and his wife&rsquo;s  interest in a transcendently lovely heroine and a repulsively plain hero was beginning  to flag, before he came upon a blurred and broken line that rewarded his patience.</p>
<p>In that splotched and besmeared labyrinth of lines the  detective&rsquo;s trained eye had discovered &mdash;</p>
<p>1. A date, March 27.</p>
<p>2. Two words, &ldquo;meet me &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>3. A line of fragmentary syllables, &ldquo;Sou &mdash; ton &mdash; est  &mdash; o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>4. Three words, &ldquo;always loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>5. &ldquo;Your &mdash; nd &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>6. &ldquo;ig &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This much, the inky impression of a heavy hand and a  broad-nibbed pen, Faunce was able to decipher upon two sheets of blotting-paper.</p>
<p>That last item, the letters &ldquo;ig,&rdquo; with a flourish under  the g, was the most significant part of his discovery.</p>
<p>The letter had been signed with the lady&rsquo;s pet name,  &ldquo;Pig,&rdquo; and Faunce told himself that to only one man would she have so signed herself  &mdash; the lover who had called her by that name at the Mecca Hotel, and whose playful  invention was doubtless responsible for the endearing sobriquet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me she did not know whether he sailed from  Southampton or Liverpool,&rdquo; mused Faunce, &ldquo;yet here,  under my hand, is the evidence that she asked him to meet her at Southampton West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to Southampton  next day, and called at the office of the American Line. If Colonel Rannock had  carried out his intention there must be some record of his passage to New York.</p>
<p>There was such a record, and a startling one, for it  proved that he had not gone to America  by the ship in which he meant to sail.</p>
<p>After some difficulty, and being referred from one clerk  to another, Faunce found the young man who had booked Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s passage  in the <i>Boston</i> on  Friday, March 29, the evening before she sailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He came after seven o&rsquo;clock, when the office was shut,&rdquo;  said the clerk. &ldquo;I was at work here, and as he made a great point of it I booked  his berth for him. He suffered for having left it till the eleventh hour, for there  were only two berths vacant &mdash; the two worst on the ship. He grumbled a good deal,  but took one of them, paid the passage money, and left his cabin trunk to be sent  on board next morning. And from that day to this we have never heard of him. He  gave us no address, but we have his trunk, and we hold the cash to his credit, and  I suppose he&rsquo;ll claim it from us sooner or later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was alone when he came into the office, but there  was some one waiting for him in a cab outside, and I believe the some one was a  lady. He spoke to her as he came in at the door, and I heard her answer him. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  be all night about it, Dick,&rsquo; she said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Faunce. &ldquo;His friends are getting anxious  about him, but, for all that, I dare say he&rsquo;s safe enough, and he&rsquo;ll call upon you  for that passage money before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s above ground I should think he would,&rdquo; answered  the clerk, &ldquo;but I must say it looks rummy that he hasn&rsquo;t claimed the cash and the  trunk before now,&rdquo; and Faunce left the office more and more concerned about that  corpse under the disused boat.</p>
<p>The steamer <i>Boston</i>  was to leave the docks late on Saturday afternoon. Why did Colonel Rannock go to  Southampton on Friday, and how did he propose to  spend the intervening hours? More questions for Faunce to answer.</p>
<p>A woman was with him at Southampton &mdash; a woman who had  not travelled with him from Waterloo,  since he was alone when Chater saw the evening express leave the platform. Who was  the woman, and what was her business on the scene? That she had addressed him by  his Christian name showed that she was not the casual acquaintance of an idle hour.</p>
<p>Faunce believed that he had found the answer to this  question in Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s blotting-book. If the letter that had left its fragmentary  impression on the blotting-paper had been sent to Colonel Rannock, a letter urging  him to meet her at Southampton West, it would account for his going there the night  before the steamer left. From those scattered words, and that signature, &ldquo;Your fond  Pig,&rdquo; Faunce concluded that Kate Delmaine had written to the man she loved, pleading  for a parting interview, and that Rannock had responded to her appeal. There were  other questions for Faunce to answer, and it was in the quiet pursuit of knowledge  that he took himself to the hotel which he deemed the best in Southampton,  engaged a bedroom, and ordered a dinner in the coffee-room at the old-fashioned  hour of six. Before dining he called upon the coroner, who was also a well-known  family solicitor, and heard all that gentleman could tell him about the inquest  at Redbridge, which was no more than had been recorded in the local newspaper. Faunce  having revealed himself in his professional capacity, the coroner expressed his  own opinion freely. &ldquo;I made up my mind that it was a murder case, and a bad one,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the tailor&rsquo;s buttons in my criminal museum. Dash, Savile Row.  That stamps the victim as a stranger. We Southampton  people don&rsquo;t get our clothes in Savile Row.&rdquo; The fashionable tailor&rsquo;s name was the  only link between the nameless corpse and the world of the living; the sole clue  to identity.</p>
<p>There was no one in the coffee-room at six o&rsquo;clock,  and Faunce dined snugly at a small table near the fire, where he was able to enjoy  a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the head-waiter, an old servant of the hotel, and possessed of  that vast extent of local and general knowledge which seems the peculiar property  of head-waiters and hotel-porters. The porter&rsquo;s knowledge takes a wider range; but  the waiter has the more subtle mind.</p>
<p>Faunce started his inquiry with a bold guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you happen to remember a lady and gentleman who  dined here one Friday evening in March last year &mdash; a tall man, good-looking, and  a very handsome woman. He was to leave for New York next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We get a good many people who are going to New York,  sir &mdash; chiefly Americans who want to look about the neighbourhood &mdash; but I do call  to mind such a gentleman dining here one night in the spring of last year &mdash; for  the special reason that he engaged a bedroom, and didn&rsquo;t occupy it, and also that  he left a crocodile dressing-bag that has never been claimed from that day to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you remember his face, do you think, if you  saw his photograph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I might, sir. I don&rsquo;t often forget a face that  I&rsquo;ve waited upon &mdash; unless it&rsquo;s no more than a casual drink and out again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce produced his capacious letter-case, in which  there were half-a-dozen cabinet photographs.</p>
<p>He selected one, and showed it to the waiter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was this the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, not a bit like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce showed him another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce took out the other four, and laid them on the  table. The waiter&rsquo;s square forefinger alighted instantly on Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the man, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Now I want you to tell me anything you can remember  about this gentleman and the lady who was with him. Take your time. I shall be here  all the evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much to tell, sir, except the odd thing  of his not coming back to the hotel. You see, sir, it&rsquo;s in this way. He and she  comes in after eight o&rsquo;clock. He gives me his bag, and tells me to order his room  for him, and he orders dinner, anythink on the premises, as quick as possible, in  a private room. I offers him the cartdurving, and he orders a bottle of Wachter,  and they has their dinner cosy and quiet, all to theirselves. I can see as she is  upset about something, and I gather that he&rsquo;s starting for New York next day, and that he&rsquo;s going to Klondyke.  He sends me out of the room when the dishes are on the table, and I gather that  they want to talk &mdash; but in taking in the tart &mdash; which they don&rsquo;t touch &mdash; and the  cheese, I hear her persuade him to go for a turn by the water after dinner. He doesn&rsquo;t  seem to want to go, but she presses it, saying as she has a splitting head, and  thinks the night air will do her good. She looks pretty bad, as white as chalk,  and her eyelids red with crying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they went out together, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, they has their coffee and their liqueur &mdash; she  has two goes &mdash; and then they go out. It must have been near eleven, for they sat  a long time over their dinner, and the night was pitch dark. If they was strangers  they might have walked into the water as easy as walk beside it; but whatever they  did, that&rsquo;s the last we ever see of &rsquo;em, and my master was out of pocket for two  dinners and a bottle of champagne; but there&rsquo;s the crocodile bag, and even if it&rsquo;s  full of brickbats, it&rsquo;s worth three or four sovereigns to anybody as a bag; and  if the gent don&rsquo;t turn up at the end of the year we shall put in an advertisement  that, if not claimed, it will be sold to pay expenses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it never strike you that the gentleman might have  met with foul play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no! There was her, you see. Two of &rsquo;em could hardly  have got made away with and nobody hear of it. I expect he was running away with  somebody else&rsquo;s wife, or some other rum start, and they went off to Jersey by the steamer that starts at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve never given the matter a thought since that  night, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it wasn&rsquo;t my business to think about it.  I ain&rsquo;t in the detective line, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce smoked the cigar of thoughtfulness by the coffee-room  fire, went to bed at ten o&rsquo;clock, and was out after an early breakfast next morning,  strolling by the water between all that is left of the old city wall and the West  Station. The tide was in, and the wavelets plashed gaily against the low parapet,  and Faunce saw how by a false step in the darkness any one might drop into eight  or nine feet of water. But then there was the medical evidence of that smashing  blow on the skull. Nor could any theory of accidental drowning account for the finding  of the body four miles away, battened down under a rotten boat.</p>
<p>Faunce spent the rest of his morning in desultory conversation  with three or four men who let out boats for hire, in whose ways and customs he  showed a keen interest, wanting to know the how, when, and where of their letting,  and if ever they lost a boat. He discovered one case &mdash; happening late in the previous  March &mdash; of a man who had had a narrow escape of losing a handsome skiff, which had  been taken &ldquo;off&rdquo; him one afternoon by a stranger, and which had been found adrift  next morning near the West Station, and never a sixpence of the day&rsquo;s hire did he  get from that swindling rascal.</p>
<p>Faunce tested the boatman&rsquo;s memory by close questioning  about the stranger&rsquo;s personal appearance, and with some difficulty arrived at certain  broad characteristics which had impressed the man at the time of the hiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was not many people wanting boats so early in  the year,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but this one told me as he had a niece living at Hythe, and  wanted to give her an afternoon on the water. &lsquo;It may be dark when I brings back  your boat,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m an old salt, and you needn&rsquo;t be afraid I shall damage  her.&rsquo; He was a big, powerful-looking chap, and he had something of a seaman&rsquo;s look,  so I trusted him &mdash; and that&rsquo;s how he tret me,&rdquo; concluded the boatman, resentfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can find me the precise date of that hiring,  I&rsquo;ll give you a sovereign for it,&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>Thus stimulated, the boatman knew he could find the  date. He had a rough-and-ready ledger in which he entered most hirings, and cash  received &mdash; and he had certainly noted down the loss of a day, and the way he&rsquo;d been  swindled.</p>
<p>Faunce went home with him to a queer little slum between  the river and the bar gate, and did not leave him till he had a copy of the man&rsquo;s  entry in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may want your evidence next assizes,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but  if I do, you&rsquo;ll be paid for your time.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank&rsquo;ee, sir. I knew that bloke was a bad &rsquo;un.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were all the answers to his questions that Faunce,.  could find in Southampton. He went back to town  that afternoon, and he spent a rollicking evening at the Battersea Gamecock, in  the company of Mr. Bolisco and a little knot of his admirers, of whom some were  &ldquo;bookies,&rdquo; and others, members of the pugilists&rsquo; noble profession. The evening&rsquo;s  talk was mostly of the Turf and the prize-ring, and it furnished Faunce with no  direct answers to his questions; but it enabled him to turn the full light of his  psychological science upon Bolisco&rsquo;s character and temperament.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wild beast on two legs,&rdquo; was Faunce&rsquo;s summing up  of the pugilist, as he strolled away from the sporting tavern.</p>
<p>He was closeted for an hour next morning with the landlord  of the Gamecock, from whom he received more than one direct answer to his questions.</p>
<p>First, as to the link between Kate Delmaine, alias Prodgers,  and Jim Bolisco ?</p>
<p>Mr. Lodway, the present landlord, had been barman when  Bill Prodgers had the Gamecock, and he remembered Kitty Prodgers running about,  fifteen years old, a rough-headed. girl in a pinafore; but always a beauty, and  always with a devil of a temper. She was an only child, and motherless. Nobody knew  anything about her mother, who had died before Prodgers took the Gamecock. The girl  and her father used to quarrel, and Bolisco, who lodged in the house off and on,  used to stick up for her, and Prodgers and he sometimes came to blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; concluded Mr. Lodway, &ldquo;was the beginning  of their walking about together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were sweethearts then, Kate and Bolisco?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they kind of kep&rsquo; company, though she was such  a kid that nobody thought it was going to lead to anything. Bolisco was a goodlooking  chap then, before he got his smeller smashed in the mill with the Hammersmith nigger.  They kep&rsquo; company for a year or two, off and on, for it wasn&rsquo;t in Kate to go on  long with anybody without quarrelling; and then, after one of her rows with her  father, she walks off and gets herself engaged at the Spectacular Theatre, straight  off. She was such a clipper at seventeen that she had but to show herself to a manager  to get took on. He&rsquo;d have engaged forty such, I reckon, at the same price. The father  was drinking as much as he knew how by that time, and things were going to the bad  here, and he took no more trouble about the girl than if she&rsquo;d been a strayed kitten:  but me and one or two more went after her, and found her in decent lodgings in Katherine  Street, and as straight as a die. But six months after that she had her house in  St. John&rsquo;s Wood, and her brougham, as smart as a  duchess: and the mug who was paying the piper was one of Bolisco&rsquo;s patrons, a Yorkshire bart, very young, and as green as a spring cabbage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Bolisco was still hanging about her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord! yes; he wasn&rsquo;t likely to lose sight of her while  she had the spending of that young softy&rsquo;s rhino.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bolisco is a bit of a spendthrift, I take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above a bit. Never could keep his money long, and yet  never was guilty of a generous action, as I know of. It&rsquo;s all gone backing wrong&rsquo;uns  &mdash; sometimes horses, sometimes pugilists. Of course, he&rsquo;s had the straight tip now  and again, and has pulled off a good thing; but as a rule, Bolisco ain&rsquo;t lucky.  Why, to my certain knowledge he had four hundred pound spare cash less than a year  ago &mdash; won it over the City and Suburban &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s got a tanner  except what she gives hima.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meaning Mrs. Randall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so! And he owes me nine weeks&rsquo; board and lodging.  I shouldn&rsquo;t take it as quiet as I do, if he wasn&rsquo;t a bit of a draw. The young&rsquo;uns  like to see him and hear him talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he sets a good example in the way of hard drinking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t encourage any man to drinkmore than he  can stand. But as long as he can carry his liquor like a gentleman &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t put the skid on. But how did you come to  know of this money of Bolisco&rsquo;s, last March?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t say anythink abou March.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it was about March &mdash; or April last year, that  Bolisco was flush, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was after Epsom Spring; and that was near the end  of April.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True. Did he show you the cash?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He brought the notes to me to get changed for him &mdash;  four fifties and two hundreds. He&rsquo;d been paid short, and he wanted tenners and fivers.  I paid the two hundreds to my brewer, and gave Bolisco my cheque for the lot, on  the London and Provincial,  Battersea Branch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you keep the numbers of the notes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me. I got the collector&rsquo;s receipt for the money,  and that was good enough for me. I paid the four fifties into my account at the  L. and P.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hadn&rsquo;t often known Bolisco as flush as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps not. He&rsquo;s often been able to flourish  a tenner, or a twenty-pun&rsquo; note, after a race; but he didn&rsquo;t use to deal in fifties  and hundreds. &lsquo;Why, Jim&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ve been getting out of your depth.&rsquo; &lsquo;Why, yes,  mate,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;may be I&rsquo;ve been a bit out of my depth.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17</h2>
<p class="note">&ldquo;All of us sinful, all with need of grace,<br>
  All chary of our life, &mdash; the minute more<br>
  Or minute less of grace which saves a soul, &mdash; <br>
  Bound to make common cause with who craves time,<br>

<p>The sky was dull and leaden, and there was a fine rain  falling &mdash; the kind of rain that means to stay &mdash; when Faunce bent his footsteps from  Sloane Square  to Selburne Street, Chelsea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kind of atmosphere that slackens fiddle-strings  and women&rsquo;s nerves,&rdquo; thought Faunce. &ldquo;I shall find her in the doldrums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Betsy, how&rsquo;s your first floor to-day?&rdquo; he asked,  when the little servant opened the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s in one of her nasty tempers &mdash; Just because  the sittin&rsquo;-room chimley smoked all the mornin&rsquo; &mdash; and she&rsquo;s that low! But you&rsquo;ll  cheer&rsquo;r hup, I dessay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that, Betsy,&rdquo; said Mr. Faunce, who  did not feel himself the harbinger of joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Mrs. Randall said peevishly, when  he knocked at the door.</p>
<p>She was crouching over the fire, in a room that was  grey with smoke, and she was wearing a terrible garment of soiled and crumpled plush,  with a ragged bead trimming &mdash; a garment she called her tea-gown, but which on her  &ldquo;low&rdquo; days was breakfast, tea, and dinner gown, and sometimes served also as bed-gown,  when the morphia needle had been freely used, and she flung herself upon her bed  in a casual way, to dream through the long night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come and sit down, if you  can breathe in this stifling hole. That beast of a chimney left off smoking an hour  ago, but I can&rsquo;t get the smoke out of the room, though I had the winder open till  I got the shivers. Well, what&rsquo;s your news?&rdquo; she asked carelessly, by way of starting  the conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad,&rdquo; he answered, in a grave voice. &ldquo;Very bad. I have  just come from Southampton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly four o&rsquo;clock, and the London light was waning, but  it was light enough for him to see the livid change in her customary pallor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old chap, and what may you have been doing there?&rdquo;  she asked, with an attempt at sprightliness. &ldquo;Been to see your sweetheart, or to  offer yourself for M.P. at the next vacancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been looking for a murdered man,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Her eyes fixed themselves on his face in wondering horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That ain&rsquo;t a very lively sort of occupation,&rdquo; she said,  after a pause, still keeping up that assumption of gay indifference. &ldquo;I hope the  party wasn&rsquo;t a near relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he was not of my blood, nor of yours; but he was  bound to you by every link that should make a man&rsquo;s life sacred. He was bound to  you body and soul, and you helped to murder him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;oh, my God! Man alive, don&rsquo;t  talk to me like that. Take the poker and smash my head open; but don&rsquo;t talk like  that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must. I pity you, but I can&rsquo;t spare you. It is my  trade to drag secret crimes into the light of day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a detective,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, you paltry cad,  you hypocrite, you coward, to come hanging about me and pretending to be my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be the best friend you ever had, if you&rsquo;ll give  me the chance. Come now, Mrs. Randall; your life&rsquo;s been a misery to you ever since  that night by Southampton Water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her terrified gaze widened as he spoke. She looked at  him as if a spirit of supernatural omniscience, a Nemesis in human form, were before  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this bad business had never come to light, if nobody  had ever come to know how Colonel Rannock was murdered, if Bolisco had never been  brought to book &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She started at the name, but the Medusa face remained  unchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much would your life have been worth to you? Could  you have ever been a happy woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; she wailed, &ldquo;never again! I loved him!  He was the only man I ever loved. I used him badly enough, God knows; but he was  the only one, the only one. Poor old Tony was a good sort, and I made a fool of  him and helped him to ruin himself, and I was sorry when he went off in a decline.  Poor chap! He just chucked his life away. Too much fizz, and too much card-playing  and late hours. Poor old Tony. He was only six and twenty when the doctors gave  him over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Rannock was the favourite,&rdquo; said Faunce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dick was my one true love &mdash; the handsomest, the  cleverest, the bravest, and always the gentleman &mdash; always the gentleman,&rdquo; she repeated,  sobbing, &ldquo;though I don&rsquo;t mean to say he was straight at cards. He had to get his  money somehow, poor fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You loved him, and you lured him to his death. You  told Bolisco where he was going, and that he was carrying his money with him, in  bank-notes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, yes! I told him. I was always a blabbing fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wrote the letter that took him to the shambles,  and you stood by and saw the blow struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God! Do you think I knew what was coming? Do  you think I&rsquo;m a fiend from hell dressed up like a woman?&rdquo; she cried, with wildest  vehemence. &ldquo;I wrote the letter &mdash; I was told to, and I had to obey. I asked him to  meet me at Southampton. Jim said if he could see  Rannock before he left England  he could get a few pounds out of him for old sake&rsquo;s sake; and Jim was as near beggary  as a sporting man with a few old friends left can be. I never thought he meant harm.  Dick and he had been friendly in the old days in the Abbey Road, and it seemed likely enough that  Dick would give him a helping hand. I didn&rsquo;t want to write that letter, mind you,  but I was bullied into doing it. You don&rsquo;t know what Bolisco is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. I know he&rsquo;s a cold-blooded murderer, and  that while you and Rannock were walking by the water, Bolisco crept up behind you  and struck him on the back of his head with a life-preserver &mdash; a blow that fractured  his skull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any one see?&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Oh, God, I&rsquo;ve heard  the dip of the oars as the boat crept up to the wall &mdash; I&rsquo;ve heard it all through  the night sometimes, in a dog&rsquo;s sleep &mdash; dip &mdash; dip &mdash; dip &mdash; and then a step on the  pavement behind us, and then a crash, and the dull thud when Rannock fell. And I&rsquo;ve  sat by this fire in the half-light, as we&rsquo;re sitting now, and I&rsquo;ve seen him lying  on the ground, and Bolisco kneeling by his side emptying his pockets &mdash; note-case,  watch, tie-pin, pulling off his rings, tearing out his shirt-studs and links, as  quick as lightning &mdash; and then making me help to drag him to the boat. And I fancy  I am standing alone by the river, in the darkness, hearing the dip of the oars fainter  and fainter in the distance. It was like a horrible dream then; and it has been  a horrible dream to me ever since, a dream that I dream over and over again, and  shall go on dreaming till I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice rose to a shriek. Faunce saw the fit of hysteria  coming, and snatched the morphia bottle and the morphia needle from the table where  his observant eye had marked them in his first survey of the room, the practice  of his profession having taught him that the first thing to do on entering a room  was to make a mental inventory of every object in it.</p>
<p>He held Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s wrist, and gave her a strong  dose of her favourite sedative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor friend, you have been hardly used,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;But your duty lies straight before you. As an accessory after the fact, the law  will deal lightly with you, and you will have every one&rsquo;s pity. You must turn Queen&rsquo;s  evidence, and help us to punish Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I&rsquo;ll never do!&rdquo; she said emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but surely, if you loved this man, you must want  to avenge his murder. Think what a cruel murder it was! A strong man struck down  in the prime of life. Think of that unburied corpse, lying hidden on the solitary  shore, the waters rolling over it as the tide rose and fell &mdash; unknown, unhonoured.  If you loved him, you must want to avenge his murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to peach upon Jim Bolisco,&rdquo; she said  doggedly. &ldquo;And if I was capable of it, my evidence would be no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Faunce, startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he&rsquo;s my husband; and a wife can&rsquo;t give away  her husband. That&rsquo;s law, ain&rsquo;t it, Faunce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband? Is that true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gospel truth. We were married at Battersea Church  when I was just turned seventeen. I didn&rsquo;t care for him, and he&rsquo;s been a log round  my neck ever since. But he was in luck just then, and he used to give me presents  &mdash; bits of jewellery, and smart hats, and such-like &mdash; and he was the first as ever  took notice of me and told me I was handsome. And he said he should take a cottage  at Wandsworth, with a bit of garden, and I was to be missus, and have a girl to  wait upon me. But his luck turned soon after our wedding &mdash; which was on the strict  q.t. &mdash; and he never took that cottage, and we never told father or anybody else.  Jim said our marriage was just a bit of a lark, and we&rsquo;d best forget it; but when  I had a fine house and was flush of money, and might have been Lady Withernsea for  good and all, but for him, he didn&rsquo;t forget it. I know what blackmail means, Mr.  Faunce. I have been paying it ever since I was eighteen. I had to find money for  Bolisco when he wanted it, for he swore he&rsquo;d claim me as his wife if I didn&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve  had what&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s sword hanging over my head all these years, and I got to hate  the man worse every year; and now I hate him &mdash; I hate him, &mdash; I hate him with every  drop of blood in my veins! I turn cold when I hear his step on the stair. I never  look at him without remembering that night, and my poor Dick lying on the ground,  and Bolisco&rsquo;s wicked hands tearing open his coat and searching his pockets, like  a wild beast mauling its prey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you want to see him suffer for that brutal murder,  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I want nothing but to have done with it all. Just  to be out of it, that&rsquo;s what I want. Do you think if they were to hang Bolisco,  it would set my mind at rest, or make me forget what a shrew I was to poor old Dick,  and how he forgave me, and came back to me after I&rsquo;d treated him so bad, and how  I wrote the letter that lured him to his death? What do I care what becomes of Bolisco?  Let him murder somebody else, and get nabbed for that. I don&rsquo;t care. Nothing will  stop my bad dreams, till I fall asleep for the last time; and then, who knows? there  may be bad dreams underground as well as above; or one long dream of hell-fire and  worms that gnaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Mrs. Randall, you mustn&rsquo;t despair,&rdquo; Faunce  said kindly.</p>
<p>He was sorry for her, and yet what comfort could he  offer? He looked at her in her ruined beauty, and thought of her life, and the two  men whose lives she had spoilt. She had sown the wind, and she was reaping the whirlwind,  and he saw no hope for her in the black future.</p>
<p>What was he to do? He had come to her prepared to make  his <i>coup d&rsquo;&eacute;tat</i>, having calculated that he could startle her into a revelation of  the murder, in which he believed her to have been an unwilling accessory. He had  succeeded, but his success was worth nothing if this one all-important witness could  not be heard.</p>
<p>He drove to Scotland Yard, put the facts of the case  before the assistant-commissioner, and Bolisco was arrested late that night at the  Game Cock, on suspicion of being concerned in the murder of Colonel Richard Rannock.  The evidence against him, excluding Kate Delmaine&rsquo;s confession, was weak, but there  was no time to lose, as she was likely to warn him of his danger.</p>
<p>If the numbers of the notes he had changed could be  identified with Chater&rsquo;s list, there would be strong presumptive evidence against  him, and other facts might come to light on inquiry to strengthen the chain of circumstance.  Faunce relinquished the case to the Public Prosecutor. It had passed beyond the  region of private interests. A murder so atrocious concerned the world at large,  and the conviction of the murderer was a matter of public importance.</p>
<p>One most painful duty Faunce had to perform, and he  set about it with a heavy heart. He had to tell Mrs. Rannock the story of her son&rsquo;s  death. Soften the details as he might, it was a terrible story to tell, and he decided  that it would be better for her son-in-law to be the bearer of these dismal tidings.</p>
<p>He called on Major Towgood, whom he found in a small  house nearer Vauxhall Bridge than Eccleston    Square, but by courtesy in Belgravia.  The Major received him in a little den darkened by a monster pile of red brick flats,  which he called the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Faunce, any news of the prodigal son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very bad news, sir. I came to you in order that you  might break it to Mrs. Rannock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will have to stand over, Faunce. Mrs. Rannock is  very ill. I may say she is dangerously ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir? That&rsquo;s sudden, for it&rsquo;s only four days  since I received her instructions, and she then appeared in fair health, considering  her age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was a wonder for her age, but always delicate  &mdash; a bit of porcelain that ought to have been behind glass in a cabinet. And she  was eaten up by anxiety about Rannock. She took a chill, coming round here to see  my wife, who is laid up, the evening after you saw her, and it developed into influenza,  or congestion of the lungs &mdash; God knows what! The doctors only tell me she is old,  and that her life hangs by a thread; but I&rsquo;m afraid we shall lose her, Faunce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that sweet old lady dies without hearing what I  have to tell her, I think those who love her best will have cause to thank God,  sir; for I believe my story would kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it as bad as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It couldn&rsquo;t be worse, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce related his discoveries, and Major Towgood agreed  that at all cost the truth must be kept from the murdered man&rsquo;s mother. In her intervals  of consciousness she had repeatedly asked about Faunce and the progress of his inquiry.  And there had been hours of delirium in which she thought the fondly-loved son was  at her bedside. She had taken a strange doctor for him, and had talked to him as  to her son.</p>
<p>No, she must not know while the knowledge could possibly  be kept from her. But should she recover, and leave her room, the newspapers would  tell her of Bolisco&rsquo;s arrest, and the inquiry before the magistrate at Southampton, where he was to be taken on the following day.  And it would not be possible to keep the newspapers from her. For her to recover,  and know her son&rsquo;s tragic fate, would mean a broken heart that death alone could  cure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re right, Faunce. Even my wife would hardly  wish the dear old lady to struggle back to life to suffer such a crushing blow.  Poor Dick! We always knew that woman would be his ruin. His sin has found him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rannock murder was the <i>cause c&eacute;l&eacute;bre</i> of the next  few months. The inquiry before the Southampton magistrate was adjourned from week  to week, and the case against James Bolisco gradually developed, till the chain  of evidence became as strong as circumstantial evidence well can be. The numbers  of the notes paid to the Wandsworth brewer by the landlord of the Game Cock were  traced, and proved identical with the numbers in Chater&rsquo;s list. Bolisco was sworn  to by the boatman as the man who hired his boat on the date of Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s  journey to Southampton, and whom he never saw after  the hiring. Bolisco was also identified by the landlord of a humble little inn on  the road between Redbridge and Southampton, as having come to his house after midnight,  on that same date, in a strange condition, his boots and trousers smothered in river  mud, and one of his hands torn and bleeding. He had hurt it with a hammer, he said.  He ate a heavy supper, drank half a bottle of brandy, paid his bill before he went  to bed, and left next morning before anybody in the house was astir.</p>
<p>Another link in the chain was a life-preserver which  a Redbridge boy had picked up in a lane leading from the river to the village street,  and on which were found minute splinters of bone, and tufts of human hair, adhering  to the heavy leaden knob. Chater pronounced the hair to be of the colour and texture  of his master&rsquo;s, while the surgeon, who had given his evidence before the coroner,  considered this formidable weapon the kind of instrument calculated to cause the  fracture he had described at the inquest.</p>
<p>The victim&rsquo;s watch and tie pin, a valuable ruby, had  been pawned by the murderer late in the year, and a West-end pawnbroker swore to  Bolisco as the man from whom he received them. Watch and pin were identified by  Major Towgood.</p>
<p>Bolisco had carried out his design with a kind of brutal  carelessness of consequences which might have seemed more natural in one of Nero&rsquo;s  gladiators, a half-tamed savage from Dalmatian forests, than in a son of the London streets. He had presumed  upon the consciousness of brute force, and when the inquest was over, and his victim&rsquo;s  identity unsuspected, he had considered himself safe for life. He stared at the  witnesses in a blank surprise, as one fact after another was marshalled against  him, and stood with bent brows, in a sullen apathy, at the end of the proceedings,  when he heard himself committed for trial at the next assizes.</p>
<p>In the dock at Winchester, and in the condemned cell at Newgate,  he had time to reflect upon his mistakes, and to think how he might have done the  thing better.</p>
<p>That was James Bolisco&rsquo;s repentance.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rannock did not live to know of her son&rsquo;s ghastly  fate. Her frail life ended peacefully before Faunce&rsquo;s discovery was a week old.  Her last breath expired in words of love, her last movement was a feeble motion  of her hand towards the beloved figure which her fancy had conjured out of thin  air, the figure of her son, standing by her bedside, as she had seen him again and  again in delirious dreams.</p>
<p>Faunce did all that compassionate kindness could do  for Bolisco&rsquo;s wretched wife. The impression of her letter in the blotting-book had  been one of the links in the chain of circumstance, for, taken in conjunction with  Chater&rsquo;s evidence, it showed why Rannock had gone to Southampton  the day before the American steamer started. Her position as Bolisco&rsquo;s wife made  her impossible as a witness; but her letter was evidence, and her relations with  the murderer became as notorious as every other detail in the story of the crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; she told Faunce, the night after  the death sentence at Winchester.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m past hurting. Bolisco&rsquo;s better out of the world, for he&rsquo;d never stop doing  harm as long as he was in it &mdash; and the sooner I follow him the better for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce proved a kind friend to the unhappy woman whose  days and nights were haunted by the image of her murdered lover. Broken in spirits,  all the evil ways of her dissipated youth wreaking their revenge upon health and  beauty, the physician to whom Faunce took her pronounced her doom. The hand of death  was upon her. It was only a question of time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she stays in London she will hardly last through the winter,&rdquo;  he told Faunce. &ldquo;I should recommend Bournemouth  or Ventnor &mdash; Ventnor for choice. And she may rub along through next summer. But  you must stop the morphia habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do what I can,&rdquo; said Faunce; &ldquo;but I am a busy  man. She is not of my kith and kin. Only I don&rsquo;t want her to die like a dog without  a friend near her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been a very beautiful woman,&rdquo; said the doctor  pityingly. &ldquo;One must be sorry for such a life thrown away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Faunce engaged Betsy, the good-natured lodging-house  drudge, to take care of Mrs, Randall, and took them to cottage lodgings at Ventnor,  not far from the Consumption   Hospital; and in that lovely  spot, facing the blue water, Kate Delmaine lived through the summer and autumn after  Bolisco&rsquo;s execution. Faunce looking in at the cottage now and then &mdash; a flying visitor  from Portsmouth or Southampton  &mdash; to see that she was being properly cared for.</p>
<p>He had found her almost penniless in her Chelsea lodgings after the trial at Winchester, her last five-pound note having been  sent to the lawyer who had undertaken Bolisco&rsquo;s defence. It was Lady Perivale&rsquo;s  generous gift upon which he was now drawing for Kate Delmaine&rsquo;s comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all I owe it to her that I was able to pull the  business through so easily,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s only fair that she should  profit by my client&rsquo;s liberality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end came when November mists were rolling up the  Channel, and the late roses were beginning to droop in the cottage garden. The end  came peacefully, and not without the consolations of religion, for Mrs. Randall&rsquo;s  landlady was a good Church-woman, and in touch with her parish priest, who was kindly  and sympathetic, and able to understand a broken heart, even in a difficult subject,  like this woman, whose life had been a stranger to all good influences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a fast friend to me, Faunce,&rdquo; she said,  when she was dying, and he had been summoned hastily for the last farewell; &ldquo;and  if I&rsquo;d known a hard-headed, kind-hearted chap like you ten years ago I might have  been a better woman. Well, I had my fling. There&rsquo;s not many women have had more  of their own way or been more looked up to than I was in poor old Tony&rsquo;s time: there&rsquo;s  not many women that ever had a truer lover than Dick Rannock, with all his faults.  He couldn&rsquo;t keep straight with the cards,&rdquo; she murmured, beginning to wander; &ldquo;but he was every inch a gentleman. Christ have mercy on his soul!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Epilogue"></a>Epilogue</h2>
<p align="center"><i>Grace Haldane To Susan Rodney</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Villa Rienzi, Rome, April 15.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me, dear Sue, when I am going back to Grosvenor Square. If  I were guided by my feelings at this present hour I should reply &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; But feelings  and inclinations may change, and my present distaste for London  society and disgust at the thought of my London acquaintance  may give way to the whim of the moment, and a sudden fancy for art, or music, or  drama, which only London  can give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I am not a vindictive woman, but I own that  I can never again take pleasure in the society of the people who so cruelly wronged  me, the so-called friends who were willing to believe in misconduct that should  have seemed impossible to any one who knew me; and who were not brave and honest  enough to come to me and discover the truth from my own lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tragedy of Colonel Rannock&rsquo;s death has impressed  me deeply. It is appalling to think of that energetic spirit, that soul of fire,  quenched in a moment by a murderer&rsquo;s hand &mdash; of the man once so admired and beloved  lying unknown and unwept in that solitary spot where the waters rose and fell over  his unhallowed grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can but remember his talents, his charm of manner,  and the days when I was perhaps nearer loving him than I suspected at the time.  Thank God for that better and truer lover who came to my rescue, and who had but  to enter the circle of my life to influence it for ever. Had I never known Arthur  Haldane I might have married Colonel Rannock, and my fate might have been wretched,  for I believe the only attraction I ever had for him, over and above my fortune,  was my likeness to that other woman, his bad angel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sue, I am not going to bury myself alive, as you  suggest. We have a host of friends in this enchanting cosmopolitan city &mdash; Italians,  Americans, English, French, Germans, Russians, choice spirits whose love of art  and beauty has brought them here, and whose pleasures take a higher range than expensive  dinners at newly-opened restaurants, and occasional contact with Royal personages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur and I are utterly happy here. The atmosphere  suits his work, and puts me in good spirits. We have found a delicious villa at  Tivoli, where we  shall retire towards the end of May, and where our days and nights will be spent  in a garden of roses and lilies, with a fountain that makes music all day long.  In the mean time this city furnishes inexhaustible pleasures and interests, and  life is so vivid and joyous that I feel as if I only began to live when I came here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my husband I need not write, for I think you know  all that he is to me; and in August, when we go to our place on the Scottish Border,  which I used not to like, but which Arthur says he shall adore, I hope my dear old  Sue will break away from troublesome suburban pupils and come to us for a long visit.  By that time Arthur&rsquo;s new novel will be in the Press, and by that time, if all go  well, there will be a young life in our home which will give new joys to our lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever your loving friend, &ldquo;Grace Haldane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S. &mdash; Pray never again address me as &lsquo;Lady Perivale.&rsquo;  I hate that semi-detached style. I am Mrs. Arthur Haldane, and am proud to bear  my husband&rsquo;s name.&rdquo;</p>
