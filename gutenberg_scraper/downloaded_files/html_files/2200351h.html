  In A Cornish Valley</h2>
<p>There are some travellers who think when they cross  the Tamar, over that fairy bridge of Brunel&rsquo;s, hung aloft between the blue of  the river and the blue of the sky, that they have left England behind them on  the eastern shore &mdash; that they have entered a new country, almost a new world.  This land of quiet woods and lonely valleys, and bold brown hills, barren,  solitary &mdash; these wild commons and large moorlands of Cornwall seem to stand  apart, as they did in the days gone by, when this province was verily a  kingdom, complete in itself, and owning no sovereignty but its own.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful region which the traveller sees,  perchance for the first time, as the train skims athwart the quaint little  waterside village of Saltash, and pierces the rich depths of the woodland,  various, enchanting. Now the line seems strung like a thread of iron in mid-air  above a deep gorge, now winds sinuous as a snake through a labyrinth of hills.  A picturesque bit of road, this between Plymouth and Bodmin Road, at all times;  but, perhaps, loveliest in the still evening hour, when the summer sunset  steeps the land in golden light, while the summer wind scarcely stirs the  woods.</p>
<p>In the mellow light of a July eventide the express  from Paddington swept with slackened speed round the curve which marked the  approach to a viaduct between Saltash and Bodmin Road &mdash; a heavy wooden  structure, spanning a vale of Alpine beauty. An exquisite little bit of  scenery, upon which the stranger is apt to look with some touch of fear mingled  in the cup of his delight: but to the dweller in the district, familiar with  every yard of the journey, the transit is as nothing. He is carried through the  air serenely, as he smokes his cigar and reads his paper, and the notion of  peril never occurs to him.</p>
<p>One man, sitting by the window of a third-class  carriage near the end of the train, looked out at the familiar scene dreamily  to-night. He was an elderly, gray-headed man, a parish doctor, hard-worked and  poorly paid; but he had a keen eye for the beautiful in Nature, dead or living,  and familiar as this spot was to his eye, it always impressed him. He sat with  his face to the engine, puffing lazily at his black briarwood, and gazing at  the landscape, in that not unpleasant condition of bodily and mental fatigue,  when the mind seems half asleep, and the external world is little more than a  dream-picture.</p>
<p>The train was not a long one, a good many of the  London coaches having been left behind at Plymouth. Dr. Menheniot put out his  head, and surveyed the line of carriages as they rounded the curve. There was a  figure here and there by a window; but the train seemed sparsely occupied. They  were nearing the viaduct. That narrow thread of water trickling over its rocky  bed in the depth of the gorge was in winter a rushing torrent. The line at this  point was under repair, and the wooden palisade had been removed in the  progress of the work. The actual danger was in nowise increased by the absence  of this barrier, which would have crumbled like matchwood before the weight of  the train, had the engine run off the rails &mdash; but there was a seeming  insecurity to the eye of the traveller as he looked into the gulf below; and  Dr. Menheniot gave an involuntary shudder. Another moment and the engine came  on the viaduct. Menheniot started up with a half-articulate exclamation, &ldquo;What,  in God&rsquo;s name&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>He opened the carriage-door, seemed as if he were  going to clamber out, to try and make his way along the footboard to a distant  carriage, outside which a girl was standing, holding on to the brass hand-rail  at the side of the door. She had that instant stepped out, or been thrust out;  Menheniot knew not which. He had seen nothing till he saw her standing there, a  slender figure in a light-coloured gown, thin draperies fluttering in the wind  &mdash; standing there, hanging between life and death, a creature to be rescued  somehow, were it at the hazard of a man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Before he could put himself in peril the chance of  rescue was over. A wild shriek rang through the wood &mdash; a fluttering form went  whirling down the ravine, flashing white athwart the sunlit greenery, and lay  half buried amidst a tangle of ferns and wild flowers at the bottom of the  gorge.</p>
<p>Twenty or thirty heads were thrust out of the  windows. The train, which to Dr. Menheniot&rsquo;s eye just now had seemed almost  empty, was now alive with people. The engine slackened speed, and stopped at  about a hundred yards from the scene of the catastrophe. A dozen men of  different ages and qualities leaped out of the train and clambered down the  embankment; among others Julian Wyllard, the Lord of the Manor of Penmorval &mdash; a  man of middle age, soberly attired, a tall stately figure, a man of mark in  this part of the country &mdash; before whom all gave way; except little Dr.  Menheniot, who hurried on ahead, intent upon affording professional help, if  such help could avail.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard had been an athlete in his boyhood  and youth. He walked down the steep, rugged hillside more easily than many men  walk down Regent Street. At the bottom of the embankment every one fell back  involuntarily, as it were, and allowed Mr. Wyllard to head the procession. They  went as fast as it was possible to go over that broken ground, trampling down  the ferns and flowers, the tiny scarlet strawberries, and crimson and orange  fungi, as they went, every lip breathless, every eye strained towards that one  spot in the hollow yonder where the doctor was hastening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use, I fear,&rdquo; said Mr. Wyllard, as if answering  the common thought. &ldquo;The poor creature must be quite dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in mercy&rsquo;s name, made her do it?&rdquo; speculated  a burly farmer; &ldquo;was she frighted, do you think, by some ruffian in the train;  or did she want to make away with herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little cluster of passengers looked at one another  curiously, as if seeking among those rustic countenances for the face of a  scoundrel capable of assailing unprotected innocence. But if guilt were present  in that assembly, there was no outward indication of the diabolical element.  Almost every one there was known to the rest: small farmers, a squire or two,  the elderly lawyer from Camelford, the curate of Wadebridge, a magistrate of  Bodmin, a cornchandler and respectable inhabitant of the same town. Assuredly  not among these would one look for that debased and savage humanity which is  viler in its instincts than the wild beasts of the jungle.</p>
<p>There might be other passengers lurking in the  train, among those loquacious women up yonder, who were all putting their heads  out of windows, straining their necks to get their share in the pity and the  terror of the tragedy down below.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyllard and his companions found little Dr.  Menheniot on his knees beside the piteous figure lying in a heap, like a limp  rag, among ferns and ground-ivy.</p>
<p>He had lifted the poor bruised head upon his arm,  and he was looking down at the dead face, the open eyes gazing in the set stare  of a great horror. Horror at the wretch who flung her down, or at that awful  gulf of death self-sought? Who could tell? Those blood-bedabbled lips were mute  for evermore, unless the dead could be conjured into speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she quite gone?&rdquo; asked Julian Wyllard, his  compassionate countenance calm amidst the agitation of the little crowd.</p>
<p>That spectacle of sudden violent death was no new  thing to his eyes. He had lived in Paris during the siege and the Commune, had  seen the corpses laid out in long rows in the cemeteries, and piled in bloody  heaps in the streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite dead, and a blessed thing too,&rdquo; answered the  doctor. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe she has a whole bone in her body. She could only have  lingered a little while to suffer agonies. Her neck is broken. Poor little  thing! She is quite a young creature and must have been pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, it was a pretty little face, even in the  pallor of death. A small <em>retrouss&eacute;</em> nose; large dark eyes, with long black lashes; pouting, childish lips; a  delicately moulded figure, neatly dressed in light-gray alpaca, a linen collar  cut low in the front and showing a good deal of the slim white throat, linen  cuffs, long thread gloves, and little stuff boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looks like a furriner,&rdquo; said Mr. Nicholls, the  burly farmer who had speculated as to the cause of her death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t somebody better examine her pockets for any  papers which may identify her?&rdquo; said a voice behind Wyllard.</p>
<p>It was the voice of a young man who had been the  last to leave the train. He had followed the rest at a few paces&rsquo; distance, and  had only just arrived to look at the dead girl over Wyllard&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You here, Bothwell?&rdquo; exclaimed Wyllard, turning  quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been in Plymouth all day, and thought  I&rsquo;d get back by your train,&rdquo; answered Bothwell Grahame easily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think  they ought to examine her pockets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; but it is a question as to whether it  should be done now or later,&rdquo; said Wyllard. &ldquo;She was evidently travelling  alone, poor creature, and she must have been in a compartment by herself, since  nobody seems to know anything about her. The chief thing to be done is to get  her carried on to Bodmin Road, where there must be an inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody agreed that this was the voice of wisdom.  Dr. Menheniot turned out the pocket of the neat alpaca gown. There was nothing  but a handkerchief, a little bunch of keys, and a second-class railway ticket  for Plymouth; no card-case or purse; not even an old letter to offer a clue to  the dead girl&rsquo;s personality. This done, the doctor arranged the poor dislocated  form decently, and two sturdy men lifted it from the greenery, and carried it  gently up the embankment to the train, where that unconscious clay was laid on  the seat of an empty second-class compartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the very carriage she was in,&rdquo; said  Bothwell, pointing to a torn strip of gray alpaca hanging on the metal handle.  &ldquo;Her gown must have caught on the handle as she fell, and this shred was left  behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell gave the bit of alpaca to Dr. Menheniot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can show that to the Coroner,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;of  course, you will be a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the only one necessary, I should think,&rdquo;  said the doctor. &ldquo;I saw her fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo; exclaimed Wyllard. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s lucky! And  what was your impression as to the manner of her fall &mdash; whether she  deliberately threw herself out, or whether she was thrown out by a villain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was asked in a lowered voice; since the  murderer, if the deed were murder, might be within hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul, I cannot tell,&rdquo; protested Menheniot,  with a troubled look. &ldquo;The whole thing was so rapid. It passed like a flash. I  was smoking, tired, in a dozy condition altogether, and this horrible thing  seemed like a dream. I saw no other head at the carriage window. I saw nothing  but that girl standing on the footboard as the train came on to the bridge; and  then, all in a moment, I saw her whirling down into the gorge, like a feather  blown out of a window. If it was suicide she certainly hesitated, for when I  first saw her she was standing on the footboard, holding the hand-rail by the  side of the door. She did not leap out of the train with one desperate  deliberate spring. However determined she may have been to kill herself, she must  have faltered in the act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be only human to do so. Poor young thing  &mdash; a mere child!&rdquo; said Wyllard regretfully.</p>
<p>He talked apart with the guard, recommending that  official to keep his eye upon the passengers who got out at Bodmin Road, and at  all stations further down the line; to mark any man of ruffianly appearance or  agitated demeanour; to give any such person in charge if he saw but the  slightest reason for suspicion.</p>
<p>The passengers had resumed their seats by this  time, and the train began to move slowly onward. The whole period of delay had  not been twenty minutes, and the line between Plymouth and Penzance was  tolerably clear at this hour. The train would be able to recover lost time  before the end of the journey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come into my carriage,&rdquo; said  Wyllard to the young man whom he had addressed as Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only a third-class ticket,&rdquo; answered the  other. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew you doing anything else,&rdquo; said  Wyllard, with a touch of scorn. &ldquo;Go back to your third-class carriage. No doubt  you want another pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe after that shock it will do me good,&rdquo;  replied the young man, producing his tobacco pouch on the instant, and  beginning to fill his little clay pipe.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyllard went back to the compartment where he  had been sitting at ease all day and alone. There is a mysterious power in the  presence of such a man which, save in the stress of the tourist season, can  generally secure solitude. The tourist season had not yet begun, and Mr.  Wyllard was known to be good for half-a-crown, and never to offer less; so his  particular compartment was sacred. Even bishops and notabilities of the land  were hustled away from the door, beguiled by the promise of something better  elsewhere.</p>
<p>He had strewed the carriage with newspapers and  magazines, and now he began to collect all this literature and to strap it  neatly together before arriving at his journey&rsquo;s end. He was neat and  methodical in all small matters, yet he was in nowise a prig or a pedant. His  tall, powerful frame and strongly marked features were upon a large scale. He  had a large brain and a large manner.</p>
<p>Look at him now as he sits in his corner of the  luxurious carriage, against a background of light-drab cloth. A man in the  prime of manhood, five-and-forty at most; a fine head well set off; light-brown  hair, thick and silky, brushed aside from a broad square forehead, in which  there are all the indications of intellectual power. Large, full blue eyes,  whose normal expression is severe, but the expression softens when the man  smiles, brightens and sparkles when the man laughs. He has a beautiful smile, a  sonorous laugh, and a voice of power and compass rare among English voices. The  features are firmly modelled, bold, massive; the mouth, when the lips are  closely set, as they are just now, looks as if it were cut out of stone. A man  likely to love profoundly, and not likely to hate lightly. A staunch friend, as  everybody knows in this part of the country; but perchance a deadly foe were  great provocation given; a man to keep a secret as closely as the grave. A man  to give money as freely as if it were water.</p>
<p>The train stopped at Bodmin Road, in a picturesque  valley, deep amidst pine-clothed hills, and adjoining a park of exceptional  beauty. There was a quiet little roadside inn, about five minutes&rsquo; walk from  the station, and to this strange hostelry the dead girl was conveyed, a  shrouded form lying on a shutter, and carried by two railway-porters. She was  laid in a darkened chamber at the back of the house, to await the advent of the  Coroner, a gentleman of some importance, who lived ten miles off.</p>
<p>An open carriage was waiting for Julian Wyllard,  and in the carriage sat a beautiful woman, smiling welcome upon him as he came  out of the station. The dead girl had been carried out by another way. The lady  in the carriage knew nothing of the tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How late the train is this evening!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I  was beginning to feel uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An accident! O, how dreadful! But you are not  hurt?&rdquo; she cried anxiously, looking at him from top to toe, suspicious of some  deadly injury which he might be heroically concealing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was not a railway accident. There is no one  hurt except a poor girl who threw herself, or was thrown, out of the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How terrible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Wyllard. &ldquo;Is it any  one we know &mdash; any one about here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she is quite a stranger, poor child, and from  her dress and general appearance I should take her to be a Frenchwoman. But we  shall know more after the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very sad! A stranger alone in a strange land,  and to meet such a death! But do you really believe that any one threw her out  of the train, Julian? That seems too horrible to be true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I believe nothing. The poor creature&rsquo;s  fate is shrouded in mystery. Whether she killed herself or whether any one  killed her is an open question. I told the guard and the station-master to be  on the alert, and to stop any suspicious character. I shall call at the  police-office as we drive through the town. Here is Bothwell,&rdquo; added Wyllard,  as the young man came sauntering lazily along. &ldquo;Did you know that he had gone  to Plymouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Wyllard. &ldquo;He did not appear  at luncheon, but as he is always erratic I did not even wonder about him. What  took you to Plymouth this morning, Bothwell?&rdquo; she asked, as her cousin came up  to the carriage door.</p>
<p>They were first cousins, and it was his cousinship  with Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s beautiful wife which secured Bothwell Grahame free  quarters at Penmorval. They were children of twin sisters who had loved each  other with more than common love, who had seldom been parted till death parted  them untimely. Bothwell&rsquo;s mother was cut off in the flower of her youth and  beauty, leaving her only child an infant, and her husband a broken-hearted man.  Captain Grahame went to India with his regiment, less than a year after his  wife&rsquo;s death, to fight and fall in the Punjaub, and Bothwell, the orphan, was  brought up by his mother&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Tregony Dalmaine, at a fine old  manor-house near the Land&rsquo;s End.</p>
<p>He was two years younger than Theodora Dalmaine,  and he was to the child as a younger brother. They were brought up together,  played together, and shared the same schoolroom and the same governess, till  Bothwell was drafted off to Woolwich, having set his heart upon being a  soldier, and in his father&rsquo;s regiment. The bright, quick-witted girl was  considerably in advance of the boy in all their mutual studies. She was  industrious where he was idle, for it must be owned that even in the beginning  of things Bothwell was somewhat scampish in his mind and habits.</p>
<p>He did pretty well at Woolwich &mdash; passed his  examinations respectably, if not with <em>&eacute;clat</em>.  His heart was set upon soldiering, and he did not object to work when his heart  was in the labour. He was a good soldier, and one of the most popular men in  his regiment. He saw a good deal of service in Afghanistan, as an officer of  Engineers, not without distinction: but he came to grief, in spite of his many  good qualities. He squandered every shilling of his small patrimony, got into  debt, and finally left the army, and thus dropped out of that one career for  which nature and education had especially fitted him, turned aside from the one  path which might have led him to fame and honour. And now he was an idler,  without place or station in the world, money, or repute, an encumbrance and a  burden to his family, as he told himself every day. He had vague ideas of  chalking out a career for himself; had visions of colonial paradises, where he  might do wonders; was always devising some new plan, inclining to some new  place; but his aspirations had not yet taken any tangible form. He was  continually falling in with some new adviser, who wrenched all his ideas out of  the soil in which they had taken root, and transplanted them to another  locality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spanish America!&rdquo; said Smith; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t think of it.  You would be dead in a week. Have you never heard of the <em>vomito negro</em>, the deadliest disease known to man? Otaheite is the  place for you! A superb climate, a new area for an enterprising young  Englishman! You would make your fortune in three years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came Jones, who laughed at the notion of the  South Sea Islands, and advised Bothwell to get a tract of waste land, near the  mouth of the Gironde, and grow fir-trees, and export their resin; that was the  one certain road to fortune. You had first your resin, a large annual revenue,  and then you had your timber for railway sleepers, returning cent per cent.  Bothwell did not venture to ask how you got your resin after you had sold your  timber.</p>
<p>Anon came Robinson, who recommended Canada and the  lumber trade; and after him Brown, who declared that the only theatre for  intelligent youth was the interior of Africa. In the multitude of counsellors  there is wisdom, says Scripture; but Bothwell found that in the multitude of  counsellors there is bewilderment akin to madness. He had an honest desire to  get his own living; but so far uncertainty as to the manner of getting it had  barred the way to fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took me to Plymouth?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Upon my  word, I hardly know. It was so deadly quiet at Penmorval this morning. I wanted  to hear the voices of my fellow-men. I went third class, you know, Dora. It  wasn&rsquo;t a very extravagant proceeding,&rdquo; he murmured confidentially. &ldquo;Shall I  ride on the box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come inside,&rdquo; said Wyllard; &ldquo;there  is plenty of room;&rdquo; whereupon Bothwell took the back seat of the barouche,  opposite his cousin and her husband.</p>
<p>Bodmin town was some miles from Bodmin Road, a  lovely drive in the tranquil July eventide; but both those men were haunted by  the vision of that dead face, those dislocated limbs, hanging loosely, like a  dead stag hauled along by huntsman and whip, while the hounds cluster round  their prey. An event so terrible was not to be dismissed lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder who she was, and where she was going?&rdquo;  said Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some little nursery governess, I daresay, going to  her situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we shall hear all about her at the  inquest. She will have been expected, and her employers will come to the fore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a terrible thing for her parents, if they are  living; most of all for her poor mother!&rdquo; said Mrs. Wyllard.</p>
<p>She pronounced the last word with peculiar  softness. She had an exalted idea of the sacredness of the relationship between  mother and child. She had passionately loved her own mother; had passionately  longed for a child in the earlier years of her wedded life. But she had been a  wife seven years, and no child had lived to bless her. A son had been born  within a year of her marriage &mdash; born only to die: and now she had left off  hoping that she would ever be called upon this earth by the dear name of  mother.</p>
<p>They drove past familiar woods and hills, ferny  dells, and limpid brooks. They saw the great brown tors standing afar off  against the amber sky: but that one haunting thought of a horrible death  spoiled all the beauty of the scene. They had no eyes for the landscape, but  sat in serious silence.</p>
<p>Mr. Wyllard alighted at the Bodmin police-station,  and spent about ten minutes in conversation with the Inspector, who was at once  shocked and elated on hearing of the strange death on the railway. He was  shocked at the horror of the thing; he was elated at the idea of an inquiry and  investigation which might result in honour and profit to himself.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard sat in the carriage with Bothwell,  while her husband and the official conversed gravely on the threshold of the  station-house. Bothwell talked about the girl and her mysterious death. He  described the poor little white face, the look of horror in that glassy stare  of death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she look like a lady?&rdquo; asked Dora, full of  painful interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, I think. She had that pretty, neat  appearance which one sees in French girls of a class just a little above the  grisette. Her frock, and her boots, and her cotton gloves must all have suited  herself and her station to a nicety. There was no touch of that vulgar finery  which makes a half-bred English girl odious. I daresay Wyllard is right, and  that she was a poor little governess, going out into a strange land to earn her  bread and learn a foreign language. There are thousands who go out every year,  I have no doubt; only this one has contrived to jump into notoriety and an  early grave at the same time. By Jove! here comes the Coroner. We shall be the  first to tell him that he will be wanted to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard blushed faintly as she turned to look  at an approaching horseman. She had not, even to this day, left off blushing at  any sudden mention of Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s name; and yet it was seven years since  she had jilted him in order to marry Julian Wyllard.</p>
<p>A sad story, all forgiven now, if not forgotten. A  deep wrong done by a noble-hearted woman to a noble-hearted man. It was the one  act of Theodora Wyllard&rsquo;s life which she could not look back upon without  remorse. In all other relations of life she had been perfect &mdash; devoted  daughter, devoted wife. But in this one thing she had sinned. This man had  loved her faithfully, fondly, from the dawn of her girlish beauty, from the  beginning of her womanly grace. She had accepted his love, and had seemed to  herself to return it, measure for measure. She had looked forward to the years  when they two would be one. And then, in a fatal hour, another face flashed  across the foreground of her life &mdash; a new voice thrilled her ear &mdash; an influence  was exercised over her which she had never felt before, a power too potent for  resistance &mdash; and, in a moment of passionate self-abandonment, she knelt at  Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s feet, and confessed her love for another. Julian Wyllard had  broken down all barriers, had asked her to be his wife, knowing her to be  engaged to another man. But there are those who think that a great irresistible  love outweighs all scruples of honour or conscience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you ask me for your freedom, as if it were  so great a favour?&rdquo; Heathcote said bitterly, as he lifted her up from her  knees. &ldquo;Do you think I would have you &mdash; this mere beautiful clay &mdash; now that  your heart has gone from me? Do you think I, who love you a hundred times  better than I love myself, would stand between you and happiness? You are free,  Dora. I have seen this misery coming upon me ever since this stranger came into  your mother&rsquo;s house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will forgive me?&rdquo; she pleaded, with  clasped hands, looking at him with streaming eyes, sorry for him, deeply  ashamed of her infidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I be angry with you, loving you as I do? God  forgive you, Dora, for all your sins, large or small, as freely as I forgive  your sin against me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her unresisting lips for the last time,  and so left her, as nearly broken-hearted as a man can be and yet recover.</p>
<p>He did recover, or was, at any rate, supposed to be  cured, since, two years after Theodora Dalmaine&rsquo;s wedding, he married a fair  young girl, penniless, friendless, and an orphan; a wife who loved him as he  deserved to be loved, and who, after less than two years of wedded life, died,  leaving two children, twin daughters. It was three years since the grave had  closed upon her, and Edward Heathcote was still a widower, and was believed to  have no thought of marriage.</p>
<p>He came riding slowly along the street in the  fading light, a man of striking appearance, mounted on a fine horse, a man of  about three-and-thirty, tall, broad-shouldered. He had a dark complexion, and  dark-brown hair, deep-set gray eyes, which looked almost black under dark heavy  brows, an aquiline nose, a heavy moustache and beard.</p>
<p>He had begun life as a younger son, and had  practised for some years as a solicitor in the town of Plymouth &mdash; had been town  clerk and a man of public importance in that place &mdash; when his elder brother  died a bachelor, and Edward Heathcote inherited a snug little estate near  Bodmin, with a curious old country house called The Spaniards. The place had  been so named on account of the Spanish chestnuts which flourished there in  exceeding beauty. On becoming owner of The Spaniards, and the estate that went  with it, Edward Heathcote retired from the law, and went to live at the place  of his birth, where he looked after the well-being of his baby girls and his young  sister, and let his days glide by in the quiet monotony of a country squire&rsquo;s  life, hunting and shooting, sitting in judgment upon poachers and small  defaulters at petty sessions, and acting as coroner for his division of the  county. He had been leading this life of rural respectability for a year.</p>
<p>He rode up to the carriage and shook hands with  Mrs. Wyllard. He was her neighbour, and had visited Penmorval during the last  year. There had never been the faintest indication in his manner or his speech  that Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s wife was any more to him than a friend. He was pleased to  visit her, anxious that she should be interested in his motherless children,  pleased to confide his plans and his thoughts to her. Time had sobered his  enthusiasm about all things, and had softened all bitter memories. He took life  now as a gentle legato movement. He had lived and suffered, and done his duty,  and that which was left to him was rest. He sat down among his fields and his  vineyards to take his ease just a little earlier than other men, that was all.  A great sorrow suffered in the morning of life ages a man by at least a decade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you waiting outside the station-house?&rdquo; he  asked; &ldquo;have you had an alarm of burglars at Penmorval?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is something much worse than that,&rdquo; answered  Mrs. Wyllard gravely; and then Bothwell related the catastrophe on the railway.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard came back to the carriage just as  the story was finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This will be a job for you, Heathcote,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sad one. The story has a brutal sound to  me, remembering past stories of the same kind,&rdquo; answered Heathcote. &ldquo;It shall  not be my fault if the ruffian escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think there is a ruffian, then? You don&rsquo;t take  it for a case of suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; replied the other promptly. &ldquo;Why  should a girl choose such a death as that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should a girl throw herself off the Monument?&rdquo;  asked Wyllard. &ldquo;Yet we know girls had a rage for doing that, fifty years ago.  However, you will have a good opportunity for the display of your legal acumen  in a really mysterious case. I did all I could in my small way to put the  officials on the alert along the line; and if any scoundrel had a hand in that  poor child&rsquo;s death, I don&rsquo;t believe he will get off easily. Where are you  riding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for an evening stroll over the downs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come home and have supper with us.  It will be too late to call it dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good, but I dined at seven. Besides,  I shall have to arrange about this inquest for to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll talk to Morris,  and then ride on to the Vital Spark, and settle matters with the people there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Vital Spark was the small roadside inn where  the dead girl was lying. The Penmorval barouche drove off, while Edward  Heathcote stopped to talk to Morris, the Inspector. The jury would have to get  notice early next morning. The inquest was to be held at five in the afternoon.  This would give time for the tradesmen to get away from their shops. The chief  business of the day in Bodmin town would be over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will give time for any one in this  neighbourhood, who knows anything about the girl, to come forward,&rdquo; added Mr.  Heathcote. &ldquo;If she was going to a situation in this part of the world, as Mr.  Wyllard suggests, some one must know all about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a man he is, Mr. Heathcote!&rdquo; said the  Inspector admiringly. &ldquo;Such clearness, such decision; always to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is a very superior man,&rdquo; answered  Heathcote heartily.</p>
<p>He had schooled himself long ago to generous  thoughts about his rival. It pleased him to know that Dora had been lucky in  her choice, that she had not taken a scorpion into her bosom when she preferred  another man to himself. He had wondered sometimes &mdash; in a mere idle wonder, when  he saw her in her beautiful home at Penmorval &mdash; whether it would have been  possible for him to make her life happier than Julian Wyllard had made it;  whether in his uttermost adoration he could ever have been a better husband to  her than Julian Wyllard had been. He had looked searchingly for any flaw in the  perfection of that union, and he had perceived none. He was generous-minded  enough to be glad that it was so.</p>
<p>The carriage drove slowly up a long hill, and  across a wide expanse of heathy ground, before it entered the gate of  Penmorval, which was two miles from the town. It was a beautiful old place,  standing on high ground, yet so richly wooded as to be shut in from the outer  world. Only the Cornish giants, Roughtor and Brown Willie, showed their dark  crests above the broad belt of timber which surrounded the good old Tudor  mansion. A double avenue of elms and yews led to the old stone porch. The long  stone fa&ccedil;ade facing northward looked out upon a level lawn divided from the  park by a haw haw. The southern front was curtained with roses and myrtle, and  looked upon one of the loveliest gardens in Cornwall &mdash; a garden which had been  the pride and delight of many generations &mdash; a garden for which the wives and  dowagers of three centuries of Cornish squires had laboured and thought.  Nowhere could be found more glorious roses, or such a treasury of out-of-the-way  flowers, from the finest to the simplest that grows. Nowhere did April sunlight  shine upon such tulips and hyacinths, nowhere did June crown herself with  fairer lilies, or autumn flaunt in greater splendour of dahlias, hollyhocks,  and chrysanthemums. The soil teemed with flowers. There was no room left for a  weed.</p>
<p>For a childless wife like Dora Wyllard a garden  such as this is a kind of spurious family. She has her hopes, her fears, her  raptures and anxieties about her roses and chrysanthemums, just as mothers have  about their girls and boys. She counts the blossoms on a particular <em>Gloire de Dijon</em>. She remembers the cruel  winter when that superb John Hopper succumbed to the frost. She has her  nostrums and remedies for green-fly, as mothers have for measles. That glorious  old garden helped to fill the cup of Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s happiness, for it gave her  inexhaustible employment. Having such a garden she could never say, with the  languid yawn of the idle and the prosperous, &ldquo;What can I do with myself  to-day?&rdquo; But Dora was not dependent on her garden for occupation. Exacting as  the roses and lilies were, manifold as were the cares of the hothouses and  ferneries and wildernesses, Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s husband was more exacting still.  When Julian was at home she could give but little time to her garden. He could  hardly bear his wife to be out of his sight for half an hour. She had to be  interested in all his schemes, all his letters, even to the driest business  details. She rode and drove with him, and, as he had no taste for field sports,  neither his guns nor his hunters took him away from her. He was a studious man,  a man of artistic temperament, a lover of curious books and fine bindings, a  lover of pictures and statues, and porcelain and enamels &mdash; a worshipper of the  beautiful in every form. His tastes were such as a woman could easily and  naturally share with him. This made their union all the more complete. Other  wives wondered at beholding such domestic sympathy. There were some whose  husbands could not sit by the domestic hearth ten minutes without dismal  yawnings, men who depended upon newspapers for all their delight, men whose  minds were always in the stable. Julian Wyllard was an ideal husband, who never  yawned in a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with his  wife, who shared every joy and every thought with the woman of his choice.</p>
<p>To-night, when they two sat down to the half-past,  nine o&rsquo;clock meal, with Bothwell, who was not much worse than a Newfoundland  dog, for their sole companion, the wife&rsquo;s first question showed her familiarity  with the business that had taken her husband to London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Julian, did you get the Raffaelle?&rdquo; she  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear. The picture went for just three times  the value I had put upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you did not care to give such a price?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, no. There are limits, even for a monomaniac  like me. I had allowed myself a margin. I was prepared to give a hundred or two  over the thousand which I had put down as the price of the picture; but when it  went up to fifteen hundred I retired from the contest, and it was finally  knocked down to Lamb, the dealer, for two thousand guineas. A single figure &mdash; a  half-length figure of Christ bearing the cross, against a background of vivid  blue sky. But such divinity in the countenance, such pathetic eyes! I saw women  turn away with tears after they had looked at that picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have bought it,&rdquo; said Dora, who knew  that her husband had a great deal more money than he could spend, and who  thought that he had a right to indulge his own caprices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, as I said before, there are limits,&rdquo;  he answered, smiling at her enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you had your journey, and I had to endure the  loss of your society for three dreary days, all for nothing?&rdquo; said Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not quite for nothing. There was the pleasure of  seeing a very fine collection of pictures, and some magnificent Limoges  enamels. I succeeded in buying you a little Greuze. I am told by French  art-critics that it is a low thing to admire Greuze, the sign of a vulgar mind.  He is the painter of the <em>bourgeois</em>, the <em>&eacute;picier</em>. But, for all that, you and I  have agreed to like Greuze; so I bought this little picture for your  morning-room. I got it for five hundred and fifty, and I believe it is a  genuine bit in the painter&rsquo;s best manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How good you are to me!&rdquo; exclaimed Dora, getting  up and going over to her husband.</p>
<p>She bent down to kiss him as he sat at the table.  They had dismissed the servants from this informal meal, so Mrs. Wyllard was  not afraid of being considered eccentric, if she showed that she was grateful.  She did not mind Bothwell. Five hundred and fifty! How freely this rich man  talked of his hundreds, as it seemed to Bothwell, pinched by the consciousness  of debts which the cost of that picture would have covered &mdash; little seedlings  of debts, scattered long ago by the wayside, and putting forth perennial  flowers in the shape of unpleasant letters from creditors, which made him hate  the sight of the postman.</p>
<p>Neither Wyllard nor Grahame ate a hearty meal. That  picture of the dead face was too vividly present in the minds of both. Meat and  drink and pleasant talk were out of harmony with that horror which both had  looked upon three hours ago. They took more wine than usual, and hardly ate  anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come for a stroll in the garden, Julian?&rdquo;  asked Dora, as they rose from the table.</p>
<p>It was half-past ten o&rsquo;clock, a lovely summer  night. A great golden moon was shining low down in the purple sky, just above  the bank of foliage: not that far-off moon which belongs to all the world, but  a big yellow lamp lighting one&rsquo;s own garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it is such a delicious  night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not indulge myself, dear; I have my letters  to open before I go to bed. I was just going to order a fire in the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fire, on such a night as this! I&rsquo;m afraid you  have caught cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it not unlikely,&rdquo; answered her husband, as  he rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think your letters might keep till  to-morrow morning, Julian?&rdquo; pleaded Dora. &ldquo;We could have a fire in the  morning-room, and sit and talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be delightful, but I must not allow  myself to be tempted. I should not rest to-night with the idea of a pile of  unopened letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave his orders to the servant. His letters and  papers were all on the library table. A fire was to be lighted there immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be late, I am afraid,&rdquo; said Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be a little late. Don&rsquo;t wait up for me on  any account, dearest. Goodnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her; and she said good-night, but  reserved her liberty to sit up for him all the same. There is no use in a husband  saying to a wife of Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s temperament, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit up for me, and don&rsquo;t  worry yourself!&rdquo; Sleep was impossible to Dora until she knew that her husband  was at rest; just as happiness was impossible to her when parted from him. She  had made herself a part of his being, had merged her very existence in his; she  had no value, hardly any individuality, apart from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian looks tired and anxious,&rdquo; she said to her  cousin, who stood smoking a cigarette just outside the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be surprised at that,&rdquo; answered  Bothwell. &ldquo;That business on the railway was enough to make any man feel queer.  I shall not forget it for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must have been an awful shock. And men with  strong features and powerful frames are sometimes more sensitive than your  fragile beings with nervous temperaments,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;I have often been struck  with Julian&rsquo;s morbid feeling about things which a strong man might be supposed  to regard with indifference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a deuced good fellow,&rdquo; said Bothwell, who  had been more generously treated by his cousin&rsquo;s husband than by any of his own  clan. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come for a turn in the garden? I won&rsquo;t start another  cigarette, if you object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I don&rsquo;t mind smoke,&rdquo; she answered,  joining him. &ldquo;Why, how your hand shakes, Bothwell! You can hardly light your  cigarette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I say that I was upset by that business? I  don&rsquo;t suppose I shall sleep a wink to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked in the rose-garden for more than an  hour. Garden and night were both alike ideal. An Italian garden, with formal  terraces, and beds of roses, and a fountain in the centre, a bold and plenteous  jet that rose from a massive marble basin. Roses, magnolia, jasmine, and  Mary-lilies filled the air with perfume. The moon had changed from gold to  silver, and was high up in heaven.</p>
<p>It was everybody&rsquo;s moon now, silvering the humble  roofs of Bodmin, shining over the church, the gaol, the lunatic asylum, and  shining on that humble village inn five or six miles away, beneath whose rustic  roof the stranger was lying, with no one to pray beside her bed.</p>
<p>Bothwell sauntered silently by his cousin&rsquo;s side.  She, too, was silent, and felt no inclination to talk or to listen. She was  glad to be out in the garden while her husband opened his letters. She knew  there was a pile of correspondence waiting for him &mdash; such letters as devour the  leisure of a country gentleman of wealth and high standing, letters for the  most part uninteresting, and very often troublesome. It would take Julian  Wyllard a long time to wade through them all. But when the stable clock struck  twelve, Dora thought she might fairly hope to find the task finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, Bothwell,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and look  for Julian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The servants had all gone to bed, and the lamps had  been extinguished, except in the hall and corridors. A half-glass door opened  from the garden into the hall, and this was always left unbolted for the  accommodation of Bothwell, who was fond of late saunterings in the grounds. The  library was at the further end of the house, a superb room, filled with a  choice collection of books, the growth of the last seven years; for Julian  Wyllard was a new man in the county, and had only owned Penmorval during that  period.</p>
<p>There was a good fire burning in the artistic tiled  grate &mdash; a modern improvement upon the old arrangement in wrought iron. Mr.  Wyllard had opened all his letters, and had evidently burned some of them, for  an odour of calcined paper and sealing-wax pervaded the room.</p>
<p>He was sitting in a low chair beside the hearth, in  a stooping attitude, deeply meditative, looking down at some object in his  hands. He was so profoundly absorbed as to be unconscious of Dora&rsquo;s presence  till she was standing close beside him.</p>
<p>The object which so engrossed his attention, which  had led his thoughts backward to the faraway past, was a long tress of chestnut  hair. He had wound it round his fingers &mdash; a smooth, silken tress, which flashed  with gleams of gold in the cheery light of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What beautiful hair!&rdquo; said Dora gently, as she  looked downward from behind his shoulder. &ldquo;Whose is it, Julian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <em>was</em> my sister&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sister who died so many years ago. Poor  Julian! You have been sitting here alone, giving yourself up to sad memories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came upon this auburn tress among some old  papers just now, while I was looking for Martin&rsquo;s lease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rolled the hair up quickly, and flung it into  the flaming coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Julian, why did you do that?&rdquo; asked his wife  reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of keeping such things, only to  perpetuate sorrowful memories? God knows we have enough of our dead. They haunt  us and plague us at every stage of life. We cannot get rid of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bitterness of his tone jarred upon his wife&rsquo;s  ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, you are wearied and out of spirits,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;You have worked too long. Were your letters troublesome?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more so than usual, dear. Yes, I am very  tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that dreadful event on the line has troubled  you. Poor Bothwell is quite upset by it. I am so sorry for you, Julian,&rdquo; said  his wife soothingly, leaning upon his shoulder, smoothing back the thick hair  from the broad, full brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, there is no reason to be sorry for  me. Dreadful events are happening every day, all over the world. We hear of  them, and feel how feeble a thing life is under such conditions as those on  which we all hold our existence. This evening I happened to be brought face to  face with a terrible death. That is all the difference.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter2"></a>Chapter 2<br>
  After The Inquest</h2>
<p>There was great excitement in Bodmin on the  afternoon of the inquest; a delicious summer afternoon, which seemed made for  quiet arcadian joys; an afternoon to be spent in day-dreams under forest  boughs, or drifting lazily adown a placid stream; rather than for gathering  together in a stifling tavern-parlour, listening to the droning accents of a  police-constable, or the confused statements and innocent prevarications of a  railway-porter. But it may be that the inhabitants of Bodmin had drunk their  fill of the cup of pastoral joys, that they had had more than enough of  heathery moorland and foxglove-bordered lane, dog-rose and honeysuckle, waving  boughs and winding streams, and that this satiety made them flock to the little  inn beyond Bodmin Road station, where they elbowed and hustled one another in  the endeavour to get a good view of the Coroner and the witnesses.</p>
<p>An inquest was not in itself such a thrilling  event. There had been inquests held in Bodmin which inspired neither curiosity  nor excitement in the mind of the town. But this inquiry of to-day interested  everybody. Who could tell what mystery &mdash; what story of falsehood and wrong &mdash;  had gone before that sad, strange death? The report had gone about that the  victim was a foreigner, and this gave a deeper note to the mystery. Why had she  come to that spot to kill herself? or who had lured her there to murder her?  These were the questions which were discussed in Bodmin freely that fair July  morning; questions which gave birth to various wise and abstruse theories,  every one of which seemed to the inventor thereof a most plausible explanation  of this dark problem in human history.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anybody can throw light upon the business,  Squire Heathcote is the man to do it,&rdquo; said Mr. Bate, grocer, general-dealer,  and churchwarden.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote was one of the most popular men  within ten miles of Bodmin. He was a native of the soil, had been known to the  neighbourhood from his childhood. He came of a race that was held in high  honour, which had produced men famous with sword and gown in the days that were  gone. Honour, courage, and all generous feelings were supposed to run in the  blood of the Heathcotes. He had succeeded to a small estate and a fine old  Grange, in which his forefathers had lived from generation to generation. In  the deepest night of past ages there had been Heathcotes in the land. Thus,  albeit he was by no means a rich man as compared with Julian Wyllard, he stood  higher than the wealthy financier in the esteem of those good old conservatives  who held that money is not everything. Mr. Wyllard was a new-comer, had bought  Penmorval just before his marriage &mdash; choosing this part of the world for his  residence because Theodora Dalmaine loved it, rather than for any leaning of  his own. He was known to have made the greater part of his money himself &mdash; a  low thing for a man to have done. Even commercial fortunes become hallowed  after they have filtered from father to son for three or four generations.  Thus, although he was altogether the most important personage in the  neighbourhood, and belonged to the landed gentry by right of recent purchase,  there were people who looked upon Julian Wyllard as a <em>parvenu</em>, and who were somewhat disposed to resent the weight which  his wealth gave him in local affairs.</p>
<p>Squire Heathcote was said to be the best coroner  who had filled that office at Bodmin within the memory of the oldest  inhabitant. His legal experiences had been of a wider range than those of the  average provincial solicitor. He had served his articles to a well-known London  firm; he had travelled a good deal, and had seen men and cities. He had been  brought into close relations with his fellow-men under manifold conditions; and  he was said to be a marvellous reader of character, an impartial and  clear-headed judge. On more than one occasion he had shown an acumen rarely met  with at a rural inquest; and he had disentangled more than one knotted skein.  It was argued, therefore, that if any one could unravel the mystery of the dead  girl&rsquo;s fate, Squire Heathcote was the man to do it.</p>
<p>Nothing could be quieter or less pretentious than  his manner as he took his seat at the head of the long table in the parlour of  the Vital Spark; but there were signs of anxiety or emotion in the sombre fire  of the deep-set gray eyes, and the nervous movement of the sun-burnt hand,  which played with his dark chestnut-beard. He sat for some minutes looking down  at his notes, and then slowly raised his eyes and surveyed the room, which was  quite full.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard was sitting near the opposite end of  the table, with little Dr. Menheniot by his side. Bothwell Grahame was seated  apart from them and nearer the jury. He had a haggard look, Mr. Heathcote  thought, as of a man who had passed a troubled night.</p>
<p>There were three or four railway officials present,  and these were the principal witnesses. First came the guard on the down train  from Paddington, whose evidence was meagre, since it appeared that he had only  seen the dead girl standing on the footboard a moment before she fell. She was  standing on the footboard and clinging to the hand-rail, with her face to the  coach; she seemed to be talking to some one inside. It had not seemed to him  that she threw herself off the footboard. It had seemed rather as if she had  dropped off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it your impression that she was thrown off?&rdquo;  asked Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. I can&rsquo;t say that was my impression. But  the whole thing was too quick for me to have a very clear idea either way. My  first thought was how I could save her. I had only just stepped out upon the  footboard when she gave a shriek and fell. She was at the farther end of the  train. Before I could get to the carriage from which she had fallen, the engine  had slackened and the passengers were getting out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the carriage out of which she fell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. There was an empty second-class next but  one to the engine. I believe that was the compartment. There was a little  basket with some refreshments, and a newspaper, which I believe belonged to the  deceased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The basket was on the table. It had a foreign look;  a poor little basket, containing a few cherries in a cabbage-leaf, and a little  bag of biscuits. The newspaper was the French <em>Figaro</em>. The Coroner handed the basket to the jury, who examined the  contents curiously. There was no scrap of writing, no card or old letter;  nothing to identify the dead girl, or to indicate the place from which she had  come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her clothes and the contents of her pocket have  been examined,&rdquo; said Mr. Heathcote, in reply to a question from one of the  jury, &ldquo;but no mark or clue has been found. Nor has any luggage belonging to her  been discovered, which is curious, since it is not often that any one travels  from London to Cornwall without luggage. I have communicated with the London  police; and I have sent an advertisement to the <em>Times</em>, and to a Parisian newspaper. Perhaps, by this means we shall  discover the girl&rsquo;s identity. In the mean time the question is, how did she  come by her death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next witness was a porter from the Plymouth  station, who had taken notice of the girl there while the train waited. He had  seen her on the platform, alone. He was sure that he had not seen her speak to  anybody. She walked up and down the platform two or three times, and he thought  she looked puzzled and anxious, as if she expected to meet somebody who had not  come. He was too busy looking after people&rsquo;s luggage to watch her closely, but  he had noticed her because she looked like a foreigner. He saw her get into a  second-class compartment near the engine just as the train was starting. She  got in hurriedly, and it seemed to him that some one inside the compartment had  opened the door for her and helped her in; but he could not be positive about  this, as he was a long way off at the time. He had seen the deceased, and he  recognised her as the young person he had observed at Plymouth.</p>
<p>Dr. Menheniot was the next witness. He gave  technical evidence as to the cause of the girl&rsquo;s death; but as to the  circumstances that preceded her fall, he could say no more than the guard. Yes,  a little more, for he had seen the carriage door opened and the girl stepping  out on the footboard. Yes, in answer to the Coroner&rsquo;s question, it had seemed  to him that some one thrust her out, yet he could not swear that it was so. The  door had opened suddenly; and he had seen her standing on the footboard,  clinging to the open door. If she had meant to commit suicide, it appeared to  him that she would have leapt at once from the carriage over the embankment.  The act of standing on the footboard and clinging to the carriage would imply  resistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might mean only hesitation,&rdquo; said Heathcote.  &ldquo;How long do you suppose she remained standing on the footboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly a minute &mdash; perhaps not more than thirty  seconds. I heard the guard signal for the stopping of the train, and then I  heard her shriek as she fell. It was almost instantaneous. The engine was just  on the bridge when I first saw her. It was in the middle of the bridge when she  fell. That will give you the best idea as to time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than thirty seconds,&rdquo; said the Coroner,  who knew every yard of the line. &ldquo;Is there any one else here who can tell us  anything about this poor girl&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no one else; though there were twenty  people in the room who had been in the train yesterday evening, and who had  gone down into the gorge to see that poor crushed form lying amidst ferns and  foxgloves, to look curiously at the small white face, the childish lips for  ever mute in death. No one could tell any more, or indeed as much about the  details of the catastrophe as Dr. Menheniot and the guard, both of whom had  seen the fall: whereas no one else happened to have been looking out of window  on the near side of the train.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will adjourn the inquest for a fortnight,&rdquo; said  Mr. Heathcote presently, after a whispered consultation with the jury. &ldquo;The  matter is much too mysterious to be dismissed without a very careful  investigation. A fortnight will give ample time for the friends of the deceased  to come forward. I have ordered photographs to be taken, with a view to her  identification. Burial cannot, of course, be delayed beyond the usual time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were morbid minds among the spectators who  envied the photographer his ghastly office. The inquest was felt to have been  disappointing. Revelations had been expected, and none had come. But Mr.  Heathcote had pronounced the case deeply mysterious: and there was comfort in  the idea that he might know more than he cared to reveal yet awhile.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard had driven from Penmorval in his own  particular dog-cart, with one of the finest horses in the district. Bothwell  Grahame, who was a great walker and altogether independent in his habits, had  come across the hills, and over cornfields and meadows, as straight as the crow  flies. The master of Penmorval&rsquo;s smart trap and high-stepping gray were out of  sight before Bothwell left the pathway in front of the Vital Spark, where he  lingered to talk over the inquest with some of his Bodmin acquaintance. The  young Scotchman was steeped to the eyes in true Caledonian pride of race; but  he had none of the petty pride which makes a man scornful of that portion of  the human family which earns its bread by humble avocations. He was as friendly  with a railway-porter or a village tradesman as with the proudest landowner in  the county; had not two sets of manners for high and low, or two distinct modes  of speech for gentle and simple, the very intonation different for that  inferior clay. Bothwell had never been able to understand why some of the men  he knew talked to a tradesman or a servant just as they would have spoken to a  dog, or, indeed, much less civilly than Bothwell spoke to his dogs. He was a  staunch Conservative in most things; but in this one question of respect for  his fellow-man he was an unmitigated Radical.</p>
<p>And now he loitered in front of the inn door,  talking to the railway officials who had appeared at the inquest, and who knew  Mr. Grahame as a frequent traveller between Bodmin Road and Plymouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one thing that didn&rsquo;t come out just  now,&rdquo; said the station-master, &ldquo;and that was the girl&rsquo;s ticket. The ticket was  for Plymouth; and yet here was this poor young thing going on towards Penzance.  Why was she going beyond her first destination, eh, Mr. Grahame? Why did she  walk up and down the platform at Plymouth, as if she expected some one to meet  her there? Why did she get into the train at the last moment, just as it was  moving out of the station? Don&rsquo;t it seem likely that the individual who was to  have met her in the station for which she had taken her ticket was the same  individual that helped her into the train, and that he made away with her? A  husband, perhaps, who wanted to get rid of a troublesome foreign wife. And he  tells her to meet him at Plymouth, and he is there to meet her, but not on the  platform as she expects. He is there in hiding in a railway carriage, and he  beckons her in just as the train is starting, when he is least likely to be  observed in the bustle and hurry of the start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put your story together very well, Mr. Chafy,&rdquo;  said Bothwell somewhat indifferently, as if not deeply interested in the  mystery which so enthralled the Bodmin mind. &ldquo;You ought to have been a  detective. But if this poor girl was murdered, and her murderer was in the  train, how is it that you who are so sharp could not contrive to spot him when  you took stock of the passengers? Mr. Wyllard gave you the office, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murderers do not carry the brand of Cain, Mr.  Grahame,&rdquo; said Edward Heathcote, who had come out of the inn door in time to  hear Bothwell&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;The assassins of our civilised era are high-handed  gentlemen, very cunning of fence, and have no more mark upon them than you or  I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the girl&rsquo;s death was an accident,&rdquo; said  Bothwell, with a touch of impatience&mdash; &ldquo;one of those profound mysteries which  are as simple as ABC. She may have been standing by the door, admiring the  landscape, and the door may have opened as she leant against it. She might  recover herself so far as to stand on the foot-board for a few seconds,  clinging to the hand-rail, and then she fell and was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a very plausible explanation, my dear Grahame.  She was leaning against the door, looking out at the landscape, you suggest,  and the door opened and let her out. How was it, then, that when Menheniot and  the guard saw her, she was standing on the foot-board with her face to the  carriage? Did she swing herself round on the footboard, as on a pivot, do you  suppose? Rather a difficult achievement, even for an acrobat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be so deuced clever,&rdquo; retorted  Bothwell, who seemed altogether out of sorts this afternoon. &ldquo;It is not my  business to find out how the young woman came by her death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the Coroner, &ldquo;but it is mine; and I mean  to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the first queer case you&rsquo;ve got to the  bottom of, Mr. Heathcote,&rdquo; said the station-master, in a tone of respect that  amounted almost to reverence. &ldquo;You remember poor old uncle Taylor, who was  found dead at the bottom of the Merrytree shaft over to Truro? You put a rope  round the neck of the scoundrel that killed him, you did. There&rsquo;s not many men  clever enough to keep a secret from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, squire; good-night, Chafy,&rdquo; said  Bothwell, moving off.</p>
<p>Heathcote followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are walking home, I&rsquo;ll go part of the way  with you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, are you on foot?&rdquo; asked Bothwell, surprised.  &ldquo;What has become of Timour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Timour is in a barn, with his shoes off, getting  ready for the cub-hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the rest of your stud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I have plenty of horses to ride, if that is  what you mean; but I rather prefer walking, in such weather as this. How is it  you did not drive home in your cousin&rsquo;s dog-cart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate sitting beside another man to be driven,&rdquo;  said Bothwell shortly. &ldquo;There are times, too, when a fellow likes to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If this were intended for a hint, Mr. Heathcote did  not take it. He produced his cigar-case, and offered Bothwell one of his Patagas.  He was a great smoker, and renowned for smoking good tobacco; so Bothwell  accepted the cigar and lighted it, but did not relax the sullen air which he  had assumed when Mr. Heathcote volunteered his company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not looking particularly well this  afternoon, Grahame,&rdquo; said Heathcote, when they had walked a little way,  silently smoking their cigars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, there&rsquo;s nothing the matter with me,&rdquo; the young  man answered carelessly. &ldquo;I was up late, and I had a bad night, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were troubled about yesterday&rsquo;s business,&rdquo;  suggested the Coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s dead face haunted me; but I had  troubles of my own without that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have seen a good many dead faces in  India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have seen plenty &mdash; black and white &mdash; but  there are some things against which a man cannot harden himself, and sudden  death is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He relapsed into silence, and Heathcote and he  walked side by side for some time without a word, the lawyer contemplating the  soldier, studying him as if he had been a difficult page in a book. Edward  Heathcote had spent a good deal of his life in studying living books of this  kind. His practice in Plymouth had been of a very special character; he had  been trusted in delicate matters, had held the honour of noble families in his  keeping, had come between father and son, husband and wife; had been guide,  philosopher, and friend, as well as legal adviser. His reputation for fine  feeling and high moral character, the fact of his good birth and ample means,  had made him the chosen repository of many a family secret which would have  been trusted to very few solicitors. His name in Plymouth was a synonym for  honour, and his advice, shrewd lawyer though he was, always leaned to the side  of chivalrous feeling rather than to stern justice.</p>
<p>Such a man must have had ample occasion for the  study of human nature under strange aspects. It was, therefore, a  highly-trained intellect which was now brought to bear upon Bothwell Grahame,  as he walked silently beside the flowering hedgerows in that quiet Cornish  lane, puffing at his cigar, and looking straight before him into vacancy.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote had seen a good deal of Captain  Grahame during the year he had lived at Penmorval; but he never had seen such a  look of care as he saw in the soldier&rsquo;s face to-day. Trouble of some kind &mdash; and  of no light or trifling kind &mdash; was gnawing the man&rsquo;s breast. Of that fact  Edward Heathcote was assured; and there was a strange sinking at his own heart  as he speculated upon the nature of that secret trouble which Bothwell was  trying his best to hide under a show of somewhat sullen indifference.</p>
<p>As coroner and as lawyer, Mr. Heathcote had made up  his mind more than an hour ago that the girl lying at the Vital Spark had been  murdered. She had been thrust out of the railway carriage, flung over the line  into that dreadful gulf, by some person who wanted to make away with her. Her  murderer was to be looked for in the train, had travelled in one of those  carriages, had been one among those seemingly innocent travellers, all professing  ignorance of the girl&rsquo;s identity. One among those three-and-twenty people whom  Chafy, the station-master, had counted and taken stock of at Bodmin Road  station, must needs be the murderer. That one, whoever he was, had borne  himself so well as to baffle the station-master&rsquo;s scrutiny. He had shown no  trace of remorse, agitation, guilty fear. He had behaved himself in all points  as an innocent man.</p>
<p>But what if the criminal were one whom the  station-master knew and respected &mdash; a man of mark and standing in the  neighbourhood, whose very name disarmed suspicion?</p>
<p>Such a man would have passed out of the station  unobserved; or if any signs of agitation were noted in his manner, that emotion  would be put down to kindly feeling, the natural pity of a benevolent mind. Had  any hard-handed son of toil, a stranger in the land, reaper, miner, seafaring  man &mdash; had such an one as this exhibited signs of discomposure, suspicion would  at once have been on the alert. But who could suspect Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s  soldier-cousin, the idle open-handed gentleman, who had made himself  everybody&rsquo;s favourite?</p>
<p>It would have been a wild speculation to suppose,  because Bothwell&rsquo;s countenance and manner were so charged with secret trouble,  that his was the arm which thrust that poor girl to her untimely death. Yet the  Coroner found himself dwelling upon this wild fancy, painful as it was to him  to harbour any evil thought of Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s kinsman.</p>
<p>There were several points which forced themselves  upon his consideration. First, Bothwell&rsquo;s changed manner to-day &mdash; his avowal of  a troubled night &mdash; his evident wish to be alone &mdash; his incivility, as of one  whose mind was set on edge by painful thoughts. Then came the fact of his  journey to Plymouth yesterday &mdash; a journey undertaken suddenly, without any explanation  offered to his cousin &mdash; seemingly purposeless, since he had given no reason for  absenting himself, stated no business in the town. He had gone and returned  within a few hours, and his journey had been a surprise to his cousin and her  husband. Thirdly, there was his clumsy attempt to explain the girl&rsquo;s death just  now, in front of the inn door; his unwillingness to admit the idea of foul  play. He who excuses himself accuses himself, says the proverb. Bothwell had  tried to account for the catastrophe on the line, and in so doing had awakened  the Coroner&rsquo;s suspicions.</p>
<p>After all, these links in a chain of evidence were  of the slightest; but Edward Heathcote had set himself to unravel the mystery  of the nameless dead, and he was determined not to overlook the slenderest  thread in that dark web.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wyllard seemed to have quite recovered from the  shock of yesterday evening,&rdquo; he said presently. &ldquo;I never saw him looking better  than he looked this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wyllard is a man made of iron,&rdquo; answered Bothwell  carelessly. &ldquo;I sometimes think there is only one soft spot in his heart, and  that is his love for my cousin. In that he is distinctly human. I never saw a  more devoted husband. I never knew a happier couple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell sighed, as if this mention of the happiness  of others recalled the thought of his own misery. At least, it was thus that  Edward Heathcote interpreted the sigh.</p>
<p>Completely absorbed in his own cares, Bothwell had  forgotten for the moment that he was talking to the man whom his cousin had  jilted in order to marry Julian Wyllard. The courtship and the marriage had  happened while Bothwell was in the East. It had never been more to him than a  tradition; and the tradition was not in his mind when he talked of his cousin&rsquo;s  wedded happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad that it is so, very glad,&rdquo; said  Heathcote earnestly.</p>
<p>He spoke in all good faith. He had loved with so  unselfish a love that the welfare of his idol had been ever of more account to  him than his own bliss. He had renounced her without a struggle, since her happiness  demanded the sacrifice. And she was happy. That was the grand point. He had  paid the price, and he had won the reward. He had loved with all his heart and  strength; he had never ceased so to love. That wedded life, which to the  outside world had seemed a life of domestic happiness, had been on his part  only a life of resignation. He had married a friendless girl who loved him &mdash;  who had betrayed the secret of her love for him unawares, in very innocence of  inexperienced girlhood. He had taken a helpless girl to his heart and home,  because there seemed upon this earth no other available shelter for her; and he  had done his best to make her happy. He had succeeded so well that she never  knew that this thoughtful kindness which wrapt her round as with a balmy  atmosphere, this boundless benevolence which shone upon her like the sun, was  not love. She was one of the happiest of women, and one of the proudest wives  in the west country; and she died blessing him who had made her life blessed.</p>
<p>And now the gossips were all full of pity for the  widower&rsquo;s loss and loneliness &mdash; a poor bereaved creature living in a lonely old  Grange, with a young sister, the twin daughters, just four years old, and an  ancient maiden lady who looked after the sister, the children, the house, and  the servants, and in her own person represented the genius of thrift,  propriety, prudence, wisdom, and all the domestic virtues. People in the  neighbourhood of Bodmin, and his old friends at Plymouth, all thought and  talked of Mr. Heathcote as borne down by the weight of his bereavement, and all  hoped that he would soon marry again.</p>
<p>The Spaniards lay in a valley between Bodmin Road  station and Penmorval. It lay on Bothwell&rsquo;s road to his cousin&rsquo;s house, and he  had thus no excuse for parting company with the Coroner, had he been so  inclined. The old wrought-iron gate between gray granite pillars, each crowned  with the escutcheon of the Heathcotes, stood wide open, and the rose and myrtle  curtained cottage by the gate had as sleepy an air in the summer evening as if  it had stood by the gate of the Sleeping Beauty&rsquo;s enchanted domain. Even the  old trees, the great Spanish chestnuts, with their masses of foliage, had a  look of having outgrown all reason in a century of repose. No prodigal son had  laid the spendthrift&rsquo;s axe to the good old trees around the birthplace of the  Heathcotes. There was only the extent of a wide paddock and a lawn between the  hall-door and that grand old gateway, and the house, though substantial and  capacious, hardly pretended to the dignity of a mansion. It was long and low  and rambling &mdash; a house of many small rooms, queer winding passages, innumerable  doors and windows, and low heavily-timbered ceilings; a house in which strange  visitors and their servants were given to seeing ghosts and hearing unearthly  noises of funereal significance &mdash; albeit the family had jogged on quietly  enough from generation to generation, without any interference from the spirit  world. People coming from brand-new houses in Earl&rsquo;s Court or Turnham Green  protested that The Spaniards <em>must</em> be  haunted; and shuddered every time the mice scampered behind the panelling, or  the wind sighed amidst the branches of those leafy towers that girdled lawn and  meadow.</p>
<p>Bothwell thought that Mr. Heathcote would leave him  at the gate of The Spaniards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; he said somewhat shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go on to Penmorval with you, and hear what  impression the inquest made upon Wyllard,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not half-past  seven yet &mdash; your cousin will be able to spare me a few minutes before dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell walked on without a word. Ten minutes  brought them to the gates of Penmorval, by far the lordlier domain, with a  history that was rich in aristocratic traditions. But that ancient race for  which Penmorval had been built, for whose sons and daughters it had grown in  grandeur and dignity as the centuries rolled along &mdash; of <em>these</em> there remained no more than the echo of a vanished renown.  They were gone, verily like a tale that is told; and the <em>parvenu</em> financier, the man who had grown rich by his own intellect  and his own industry &mdash; naturally a very inferior personage &mdash; reigned in their  stead.</p>
<p>Penmorval seemed not quite so dead asleep as  Heathcote Grange, <em>alias</em> The  Spaniards. In the sweet stillness of the summer evening, Bothwell and his  companion heard voices &mdash; women&rsquo;s voices &mdash; familiar and pleasant to the ears of  both.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard was strolling in the avenue, with a  young lady by her side, a girl in a white gown and a large leghorn hat; tall,  slight, graceful of form, and fair of face &mdash; a girl who gave a little cry of  pleased surprise at seeing Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just rushing home, Edward,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;for  fear I should keep you waiting for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Hilda! Then I can only say that your idea  of rushing is my idea of sauntering,&rdquo; her brother answered, smiling at the  girlish face, as he shook hands with Mrs. Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Mr. Wyllard think of the inquest?&rdquo; he  asked. &ldquo;You have seen him, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for a minute as he drove by to the house,  while Hilda and I were walking in the avenue. Why, Bothwell, how fagged and ill  you look!&rdquo; exclaimed Dora to her cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only bored,&rdquo; answered Bothwell, which was not  complimentary to the companion of his long walk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you look positively exhausted, poor fellow,&rdquo;  pursued Dora pityingly. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come back in the dog-cart? There was  room for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wanted to be alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I wanted company,&rdquo; said Heathcote, laughing,  &ldquo;so I inflicted my society upon an unwilling companion. Very bad manners, no  doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you got the worst of the bargain,&rdquo;  muttered Bothwell, with a sullen look, at which Hilda&rsquo;s blue eyes opened wide  with wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, Mr. Heathcote, an idle life does not  agree with my cousin,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;I never know what it is to be weary of  Penmorval or the country round; but for the last three or four weeks Bothwell  has behaved as if he hated the place, and could find neither rest nor amusement  within twenty miles of us. He is perpetually running off to Plymouth or to  London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish women would take to reading their  dictionaries, instead of cramming their heads with other women&rsquo;s novels,&rdquo;  exclaimed Bothwell savagely, &ldquo;for then perhaps they might have some idea of the  meaning of words. When you say I run up to London perpetually, Dora, I suppose  you mean that I have been there twice &mdash; on urgent business, by the way &mdash; within  the last five weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to Plymouth at least a dozen times,&rdquo; protested  Dora. &ldquo;All I can say is that you are my idea of perpetual motion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you are hardly ever at home, Mr. Grahame,&rdquo;  said Hilda, supporting her friend.</p>
<p>They strolled towards the house as they talked, and  half-way along the avenue they met the master of Penmorval, correctly attired  in sober evening-dress, with a light overcoat worn loosely above his faultless  black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Heathcote? Do you know, Dora, that  it is ten minutes to eight? You&rsquo;ll stop and dine with us, of course,&rdquo; added  Wyllard cordially. &ldquo;You refused last night; but now Hilda is here, and you have  no excuse for going home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only came to afternoon tea,&rdquo; said Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you and my wife have been gossiping from five  o&rsquo;clock until now. Deepest mystery of social life, what two women can find to  talk about for three mortal hours in the depths of a rural seclusion like  this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mystery to a man, who cannot imagine that women  either think or read,&rdquo; retorted Dora, taking her husband&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;You men have a  fixed idea that your wives and sisters have only two subjects of conversation,  gowns and servants. Of course, you will stay and dine, Mr. Heathcote. I am not  going to dress for dinner, so please don&rsquo;t look at your frock-coat as if that  were an insuperable obstacle. You and Hilda are going to stop, whether you like  it or not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we always like to be here,&rdquo; said Hilda,  in her low sweet voice.</p>
<p>She stole a shy little look at Bothwell, as if  wondering what he thought of the matter; but Bothwell&rsquo;s countenance was  inscrutable.</p>
<p>Hilda was pained but not surprised by his manner.  He had changed to her so strangely within the last few months &mdash; he who half a  year ago had been so kind, so attentive. She was not angry &mdash; she was not vain  enough to wonder that a man should begin by caring for her a little, and then  leave off caring all at once, and relapse into absolute indifference. She  supposed that such fickleness was a common attribute of the superior sex.</p>
<p>They all went to the house, and through a glass  door into the large low drawing-room, where the butler immediately announced  dinner. The two ladies had only time to take off their hats before they went  into the dining-room. They were both in white, and there was a grace in Dora  Wyllard&rsquo;s simple gown, a cluster of roses half hidden by the folds of an Indian  muslin fichu, a swan-like throat rising from a haze of delicate lace, which was  more attractive than the costliest toilet ever imported from Paris to be the  wonder of a court ball. Yes, she was of all women Edward Heathcote had ever  known the most gracious, the most beautiful. Those seven years of happy married  life had ripened her beauty, had given a shade of thoughtfulness to the  matron&rsquo;s dark eyes, the low wide brow, the perfect mouth, but had not robbed  the noble countenance of a single charm. The face of the wife was nobler than  the face of the girl. It was the face of a woman who lived for another rather  than for her own happiness; the face of a woman superior to all feminine  frivolity, and yet in all things most womanly.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote sighed within himself as he took  his place beside his hostess in the subdued light of the old panelled room, a  warm light from lamps that hung low on the table, under rose-coloured shades,  umbrella-shaped, spreading a luminous glow over silver and glass and flowers,  and leaving the faces of the guests in rosy shadow. He sighed as he thought how  sweet life would have been for him had this woman remained true to her first  love. For she had loved him once. Eight years ago they two had clasped hands,  touched lips, as affianced lovers. He could never forget what she had been to  him, or what she might have been. He sat at her husband&rsquo;s table in all loyalty  of soul, in staunch friendship. He would have cut his heart out rather than  debased himself or Dora by one guilty thought. Yet he could but remember these  things had been.</p>
<p>The two ladies left almost immediately after  dinner, and Bothwell sauntered out into the garden directly afterwards. Not to  rejoin them, as he would have done a few months ago, but to smoke the cigar of  solitude in a path beside a crumbling, old red wall, and a long, narrow border  of hollyhocks, tall, gigantic, yellow, crimson, white, and pink. There were  fruit-trees on the other side of the wall, which was supported with tremendous  buttresses at intervals of twenty feet or so, and about wall and buttresses  climbed clematis and passion-flower, jasmine, yellow and white, and the great  crimson trumpets of the bignonia.</p>
<p>The banker and the lawyer sat silently for a few  minutes, Julian Wyllard occupied in the choice of a cigar from a case which he  had first offered to his guest; and then Edward Heathcote asked him what he  thought of the inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it altogether unsatisfactory,&rdquo; answered  Wyllard. &ldquo;You did your best to thrash out a few facts; but those fools of  railway people had nothing to tell worth hearing. Everybody knows that the poor  creature fell off the train &mdash; or was thrown off. What we want to find out is  whether there was foul play in the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my belief that there was,&rdquo; said Heathcote,  looking at him fixedly in the dim roseate light, almost as unsatisfactory for  such a scrutiny as the changeful glow of the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine,&rdquo; answered Wyllard; &ldquo;and so strong is my  conviction upon this point that I stopped at the post-office on my way home,  and telegraphed to my old friend Joe Distin, asking him to come down and help  us to solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the criminal lawyer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom else should I mean? He and I were  schoolfellows. I have asked him to stop at Penmorval while he carries on his  investigation.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter3"></a>Chapter 3<br>
  Joseph Distin </h2>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard was surprised and even horrified when,  on the morning after the inquest, her husband told her that he had invited  Distin, the criminal lawyer, to stay at Penmorval while he investigated the  mystery of the nameless girl&rsquo;s death. The presence of such a man beneath her  roof seemed to her like an outrage upon that happy home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora, what a delightful embodiment of  provincial simplicity you show yourself in this business!&rdquo; said her husband  laughingly. &ldquo;I believe you confound the lawyer who practises in the criminal  courts with the police-agent you have read about in French novels. A man of low  birth and education, with nothing but his native wit to recommend him; a man  whose chief talent is for disguises, and who passes his life in a false beard  and eyebrows, in the company of thieves and murderers, whom it is his business  to make friends with and then betray. Joe Distin is a solicitor of long  standing, whose chief practice happens to be in the Old Bailey. He is a most  accomplished person, and the friend of princes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is your friend, Julian, so I ought not for a  moment to have doubted that he is a gentleman,&rdquo; answered Dora sweetly, with her  hand resting on her husband&rsquo;s shoulder. Such a lovely hand, with long tapering  fingers, and dimples where other people have knuckles, like a hand in an early  Italian picture. &ldquo;Still, I wish with all my heart that he were going to stay at  the hotel. I don&rsquo;t want you to be involved in this terrible business. Why  should you concern yourself about it, Julian? Nothing you can do can be of use  to the poor dead girl. What is it all to you? What have you to do with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My duty,&rdquo; answered Wyllard firmly. &ldquo;As a  magistrate I am bound to see that a terrible crime &mdash; if crime it be &mdash; shall not  go unpunished in my district. I have no particular aptitude in unravelling  mysteries. I therefore send for my old schoolfellow, who has won his reputation  among the sinuous ways of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I remember. You and Mr. Distin were together  at Marlborough,&rdquo; said Dora musingly. &ldquo;That is enough to make him an interesting  person in my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we were companions and rivals in the same  form,&rdquo; answered Julian. &ldquo;There were some who thought us two the sharpest lads  in the school. In all our studies we were neck and neck: but in other points  the difference between us was a wide one. Distin was the son of a rich London  solicitor &mdash; an only son, who could draw upon an indulgent father for means to  gratify every whim, who had his clothes made by a fashionable tailor, and could  afford to hire a hunter whenever he got the chance of riding one. I was one of  many children &mdash; the fourth son of a Warwickshire parson; so I had to reckon my  cash by sixpences, and to wear my clothes till they were threadbare. Yes, there  was an impassable gulf between Distin and me in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you must be a great deal richer than he,  and you can receive him in this lovely old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be some pride in that. Yes, Dora,  Fortune was at home to me when I knocked at her door. I have been what is  called a lucky man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are a happy one, I hope,&rdquo; murmured his  wife, leaning her head upon his shoulder, as he stood before the open window,  looking dreamily out at summer woods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ineffably happy, sweet one, in having won you,&rdquo; he  answered tenderly, kissing the fair broad brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been wonderfully clever,&rdquo; said Dora  enthusiastically, &ldquo;beginning without any capital, and within twenty years  making a great fortune and a great name in the world of finance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was fortunate in my enterprises when I was a  young man, and I lived at a time when fortunes were made &mdash; and lost &mdash; rapidly.  I may have had a longer head than some of my compeers; at any rate, I was  cooler-headed than the majority of them, and I kept out of rotten schemes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or got out of them before they collapsed,&rdquo; Mr.  Wyllard might have said, had he displayed an exhaustive candour.</p>
<p>But in talking of business matters to a woman a man  always leaves a margin.</p>
<p>So after a good deal more discursive talk between  husband and wife it was agreed that Mr. Distin&rsquo;s visit was not to be regarded  as an affliction. A telegram arrived while Mr. and Mrs. Wyllard were talking,  announcing the lawyer&rsquo;s arrival by the same train which had carried the  nameless waif to her grave in the valley, the train which was due at Bodmin  Road at a quarter before eight. The dog-cart was to meet the guest, and dinner  was to be deferred till nine o&rsquo;clock for his accommodation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can send a line to Heathcote and ask him to  dine with us to-night,&rdquo; said Wyllard. &ldquo;I know he is interested in this  business, and would like to meet Distin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hilda &mdash; you won&rsquo;t mind having Hilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. Hilda is an ornament to any  gentleman&rsquo;s dining-table. But how fond you have become of Hilda lately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was always fond of her. Do you know there is  something that puzzles me very much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few months ago I thought Bothwell was in love  with Hilda. He seemed devoted to her, and was always asking me to have her over  here. I was rejoicing at the idea of the poor fellow getting such a sweet girl  for his wife, for I thought Hilda rather liked him, when all at once he cooled,  and appeared actually to go out of his way in order to avoid her. Strange, was  it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fickleness of an idle mind, no doubt,&rdquo;  answered Wyllard carelessly.</p>
<p>He had not his wife&rsquo;s keen interest in the joys and  sorrows of other people. He was said to be a kind-hearted man. He was good to  the poor in a large way, and never shut his purse against the appeal of  misfortune. But he could not be worried about the details of other people&rsquo;s  lives. He did not care a straw whether Bothwell was or was not in love with  Hilda. To his wife, on the contrary, the question was vital, involving the  happiness of two people whom she loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your cousin does not put his shoulder to the  wheel before long he will fall into a very bad way,&rdquo; said Wyllard decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be very glad to do it, if he only knew  what wheel to shoulder,&rdquo; said Bothwell&rsquo;s voice outside, as he sauntered to the  window, wafting aside the smoke of his cigarette.</p>
<p>It seemed to Dora as if her cousin spent his home  life in smoking cigarettes and sauntering in the gardens, where, on his  energetic days, he helped her in her war of extermination against the greenfly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is always a wheel to be moved by the man who  is not afraid of work,&rdquo; said Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am told, but I have found no such wheel, as a  civilian. Seriously, Julian, I know that I am an idler and a reprobate, that I  am taking advantage of your kindness and letting life slip by me just because I  have the run of my teeth in this fine old place, and because you and Dora are  worlds too good to me. I have been taking my own character between my teeth and  giving it a good shaking within the last few days, and I mean to turn over a  new leaf. I shall go abroad &mdash; to the South Seas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you to do for a living in the South  Seas?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something. Sub-edit a colonial paper, keep a  grocery store, turn parson and convert the nigger. I shall fall upon my feet,  you may be sure. I shall find something to do before I have been out there  long. Or if Otaheite won&rsquo;t give me a roof and a crust, I can cross to the  mainland and drive sheep. Something I must do for my bread. Into the new world  I must go. The atmosphere of the old world is stifling me. I feel as if I was  living in an orchid house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bothwell, you are not going to the other end  of the world,&rdquo; said Dora affectionately. &ldquo;You ought not to say such things,  Julian, making him feel as if he were an intruder, as if he were not welcome  here; my first cousin, the only companion of my youth that remains to me now my  dear mother is gone. Surely we who are rich need not grudge our kinsman a  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest, you ought to know that I spoke for  Bothwell&rsquo;s sake, and from no other motive than my care for his interest,&rdquo;  answered Julian gravely. &ldquo;A young man without a profession is a young man on  the high-road to perdition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you with all my soul,&rdquo; cried Bothwell,  with feverish energy, &ldquo;and I shall sail for Otaheite in the first ship that  will carry me. Not because I do not love you, Dora, but because I want to be  worthier of your love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lighted a fresh cigarette, and sauntered away  from the window, to breathe latakia over the John Hoppers and Victor Verdiers  on the wall.</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears. She was angrier with  her husband than she had ever been since her marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very unkind of you to drive Bothwell out of  your house,&rdquo; she said indignantly. &ldquo;You make me regret that I have not a house  of my own. You forget how fond we have always been of each other &mdash; that he is  as dear to me as a brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is because I remember that fact that I am  anxious to stimulate Bothwell to action of some kind,&rdquo; answered her husband.  &ldquo;Do you think it is good for any young man to lead the kind of life your cousin  leads here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he were to marry he would become more  industrious, I have no doubt,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;You might pension off old Mr.  Gretton, and make Bothwell your land-steward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which in Bothwell&rsquo;s case would mean a genteel  dependence, under the disguise of a responsible position. Bothwell would be  seen on every racecourse in the west country &mdash; would play billiards at the  George, shoot my game, and let somebody else do my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that my cousin is a dishonourable  man?&rdquo; asked Dora indignantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear. I mean that he is a man who has spoiled  one career for himself, and will have to work uncommonly hard in order to find  another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was cruel logic to Dora&rsquo;s ear. For the first  time in her life she thought that her husband was ungenerous; and for the first  time in her life she reckoned her own fortune as an element of power. Hitherto  she had allowed her rents to be paid into her husband&rsquo;s bank. She had her own  cheque-book, and drew whatever money she wanted; but she never looked at her  pass-book, and she did not even ask what income each year brought her, or what  surplus was left at the end of the year. She had never offered to help Bothwell  with money; she had felt that any such offer would humiliate him. But now she  considered for the first time that her money must have accumulated to a  considerable extent, and that it was in her power to assist Bothwell with  capital for any enterprise which he might desire to undertake. If he had set  his heart upon going to the South Sea Islands, he should not start with an  empty purse.</p>
<p>The train from Paddington came into Bodmin Road station  with laudable punctuality, and without mischance of any kind; and the dog-cart  brought Mr. Distin to Penmorval before half-past eight. Dora was in the  drawing-room when he arrived. She had dressed early in order to be ready to  welcome her husband&rsquo;s friend; even albeit he came to her with a perfume of the  Old Bailey.</p>
<p>In spite of Wyllard&rsquo;s praise of his old  schoolfellow, Dora had expected a foxy and unpleasant individual, with craft in  every feature of his face.</p>
<p>She was agreeably surprised on beholding a  good-looking man, with aquiline nose, dark eyes, hair and whiskers inclining to  gray, slim, well set up, neat without being dapper or priggish &mdash; a man who  might have been taken for an artist or an author, just as readily as for a  lawyer versed in the dark ways of crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend Wyllard looks all the better for his  rural seclusion,&rdquo; said Distin, after he had been introduced to Dora. &ldquo;He seems  to me a younger man by ten years than he was when I met him in Paris just ten  years ago. And that means twenty years to the good, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it really ten years since you have met?&rdquo;  exclaimed Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly a decade. Our last meeting was a chance  encounter in the Palais Royal in the summer of &rsquo;72, when Paris was just  beginning to recover herself after the horrors of the Commune. We ran against  each other one day at dinner-time &mdash; both making for V&eacute;four&rsquo;s, where we dined  together and talked over old times. I thought that evening my friend looked  aged and haggard, nervous and worried, and I put it down to the ruling disease  of our epoch, high-pressure. I knew it could not be the effect of late hours or  dissipation of any kind, for Wyllard was always as steady as old Time. But now  I find him regenerated, glorified by rustic pleasures. Happy fellow, who can  afford to enjoy his <em>otium cum dignitate</em> in the very prime of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what he says, Dora,&rdquo; said Wyllard  laughingly. &ldquo;Now, I daresay what he thinks is: &lsquo;How can this poor devil endure  his existence out of London &mdash; two hundred and forty miles from the clubs &mdash; from  the opera-house &mdash; from the first nights of new plays &mdash; the crowd of familiar  faces?&rsquo; I know my friend Distin of old, and that he could not exist out of  London any more than a fish can live out of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like my little London,&rdquo; admitted Distin coyly,  almost as if he were talking of a fascinating woman. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s so much in it,  and it&rsquo;s such a devilish wicked place, to those who really know it. But I think  the country a most delightful institution &mdash; from Saturday to Monday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cockney stands confessed in that one remark,&rdquo;  said Wyllard, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the worst of Devonshire and Cornwall,&rdquo;  pursued Distin, in his airy way. &ldquo;Charming scenery, eminently picturesque; but  not available between Saturday and Monday. Now, there is one ineffable charm in  those pretty places up the river, and that rural district round Tunbridge  Wells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray what is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is always so delighted to arrive on Saturday  afternoon, and so charmed to leave on Monday morning. The rustic aroma just  lasts till Sunday night, and the keen craving for town begins with the dawn of  Monday. But I must go and get rid of two hundred and forty miles of dust,&rdquo; said  Mr. Distin, slipping off as lightly as a boy.</p>
<p>He left the drawing-room at twenty minutes to nine,  and returned at five minutes before the hour, in full evening-dress. It was  like a conjuring trick. His costume was of the quietest, yet there was a finish  and style about everything that impressed even the ignorant. One felt that the  very latest impress of Fashion&rsquo;s fairy fingers had touched that shirt, had  meted out the depth of the silk collar, the curve of the sleeve. That black  pearl centre-stud might have been the last gift of a prince or a grateful  beauty. One ring, and one only, adorned the solicitor&rsquo;s left hand; but that ring  was a table diamond, two hundred and forty years old, said to have been given  by Anne of Austria to the Duke of Buckingham.</p>
<p>Bothwell, who took some pride in his clothes,  looked clumsy and unfashionable beside the London lawyer, or at any rate  fancied that he did. Edward Heathcote was at all times a careless dresser, but  his tall figure, and a certain dash which was more soldierly than civilian,  made him an important personage in every circle. He had the free grace, the  easy movements, of a man who has spent his boyhood and youth out of doors &mdash;  hunting, shooting, fishing, mountaineering.</p>
<p>The dinner was lively, thanks chiefly to Joseph  Distin, for Bothwell had a dispirited air, and Hilda could not help feeling  unhappy at seeing his gloom, though she tried to conceal her sympathy. Mr.  Wyllard and Mr. Distin had the conversation to themselves during the greater  part of the meal, for Mr. Heathcote was graver and more reserved than usual,  and Dora had a subdued and thoughtful air. She would have been quite ready to  admit that Joseph Distin was a very agreeable person, and altogether worthy of  her husband&rsquo;s friendship; but she could not dissociate him from the horror of  the event which caused his presence in that house. She felt that of those  gathered around her table that night, in the shaded light of the low lamps,  amidst the perfume of hothouse flowers, the greater number were brooding upon a  mystery which might mean murder.</p>
<p>She was very glad to escape to the drawing-room  with Hilda, directly dinner was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I suppose, they will talk of that poor  creature&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come, Hilda, sing one of Schubert&rsquo;s ballads, and  let us try to forget all that horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda seated herself at the piano obediently, and  began &ldquo;Mignon.&rdquo; She had a superb mezzo-soprano, clear as a bell, ripe and round  and full. The rich notes went pealing up to the low ceiling and floating out at  the open windows. Perhaps Bothwell heard them in the dining-room, for he came  sauntering in presently, and slipped quietly into a seat in a shadowy corner.  Hilda always sang and played from memory. There was no irksome duty to be done  in the way of turning over music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you desert the gentlemen, Bothwell?&rdquo;  asked Dora, when the song was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were talking of that diabolical inquest  again. Nobody in Bodmin seems able to talk of anything else. Wherever I went  to-day I heard the same ghastly talk &mdash; every imaginable suggestion, and not one  grain of common sense. What ghouls people must be to gloat over such a subject!  No wonder that men who live in great cities despise the rustic mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not find that the inhabitants of cities are  any less ghoulish,&rdquo; retorted Dora, who felt warmly about her native soil, and  would have fought for Cornish people and Cornish institutions to the death.  &ldquo;See how the London papers gloat over the details of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These three spent the evening very quietly in the  drawing-room, while the three men in the dining-room were discussing the event  on the railway.</p>
<p>Hilda sang some of Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s favourite songs,  while her hostess sat in the lamp-light by an open window working at a group of  sunflowers on a ground of olive plush. Bothwell kept in his dark corner all the  evening, so quiet that he might have been asleep, save that he murmured a  &ldquo;Thank you, Miss Heathcote, very lovely,&rdquo; after one of Hilda&rsquo;s songs. She  thought that he was only grateful for having had his slumber soothed by a vague  strain of melody.</p>
<p>The men in the dining-room had turned away from the  lighted table, and were sitting in a little knot in the embrasure of the wide  Tudor window, smoking their cigars, half in the ruddy glow of the lamps and  half in the mellow light of the newly-risen moon. They could hardly see each  other&rsquo;s faces in that uncertain light. Stodden, the butler, had wheeled a table  over to the window and arranged the claret-jugs and glasses upon it, before he  left the room. The little knot of men smoking and drinking by the window looked  a picture of comfort, with the soft sweet air blowing in from the garden, and  the great full moon shining over the roses and the fountain in the  old-fashioned parterre. Joseph Distin&rsquo;s keen eye noted every detail of his  friend&rsquo;s surroundings; and he told himself that, for the fourth son of a  village vicar, Julian Wyllard had done remarkably well.</p>
<p>Between them Wyllard and the Coroner had contrived  to put the London lawyer in full possession of the facts relating to the girl&rsquo;s  death. Those facts were unfortunately of the scantiest. Edward Heathcote  breathed no hint of that dark suspicion about Bothwell which had flashed into  his mind after the inquest, and which he had vainly endeavoured to shake off  since that time. Bothwell&rsquo;s manner at dinner this evening had not been  calculated to disarm suspicion. His moody brow, his silence and abstraction, were  the unmistakable signs of secret trouble of some kind. That trouble was  coincidental in time with the event on the railway; for Heathcote and Bothwell  had met in Bodmin, and had ridden home together on the previous day, and the  young man had been cheery enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ticket found upon the girl was from London to  Plymouth, I apprehend,&rdquo; said Distin, when he had heard everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she started from Paddington that morning. My  business will be to find out who she was, and the motive of her journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you think there is a possibility of tracing  her in London, without a shred of evidence &mdash; except the photograph of a dead  face?&rdquo; exclaimed Wyllard. &ldquo;To my mind it seems like looking in a brook for a  bubble that broke there a week ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a west countryman you should remember how  otter-hounds hunt the bead on the water,&rdquo; answered Distin. &ldquo;With a photograph,  the police ought to be able to trace that girl &mdash; even in the wilderness of  London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if she were a foreigner, and only passed  through London?&rdquo; suggested Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then she would leave her bead, like the  otter. She could not get a night&rsquo;s shelter without some one knowing of her  coming and going. Unless she slept in the lowest form of lodging-house &mdash; a  place through which the herd of strange faces are always passing &mdash; the  probabilities are in favour of her face being remembered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judging by the neatness of her clothes and the  refinement of her features, she must have been the last person likely to set  foot in a common lodging-house,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;But there was no money found  upon her; neither purse nor papers of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fact is to me almost conclusive,&rdquo; said  Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon what point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It convinces me that she was made away with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; exclaimed Wyllard, much surprised. &ldquo;The  thing never occurred to me in that light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, my dear friend. You have not devoted  twenty years of your life to the study of the criminal mind,&rdquo; answered the  lawyer easily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see that the first thought of a man who made up his  mind to throw a girl out of a train &mdash; unless he did the act in a blind fury  which gave him no time for thought of any kind &mdash; his first precaution, I say,  would be to see that there was no evidence of her identity upon her, more  especially where the victim was a stranger in the land, as this poor thing was?  The identification of the victim is often half-way towards the identification  of the murderer. But if the dead can be buried unrecognised &mdash; a nameless  unknown waif, in whose fate no private individual is interested &mdash; why, after  the funeral the murderer may take his ease and be merry, assured that he will  hear no more of the matter. Public interest in a mysterious crime of that kind  soon dies out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that this poor girl was the victim  of a crime?&rdquo; asked the Coroner, surprised to find his own idea shared by the  great authority.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my own mind I have no doubt she was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should she not have committed suicide?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should she have travelled from London to  Cornwall in order to throw herself over that particular embankment?&rdquo; demanded  Distin. &ldquo;An unnecessary luxury, when there were the Holborn Viaduct and a score  of bridges at her service, to say nothing of the more natural exit by her own  bedroom window. Besides, in the statistics of self-murder you will find that  nineteen out of twenty suicides &mdash; nay, I might almost say ninety-nine out of a  hundred &mdash; leave a piteous little note explaining the motive of the deed &mdash; an  appeal to posterity, as it were. &lsquo;See how great a sufferer I have been, and  what a heroic end I have made.&rsquo; No, there is only one supposition that would  admit this girl being her own destroyer. Some ruffian in the train might have  so scared her that she flung herself out, in a frantic effort to escape from  him. But against this possibility there is the fact of the absence of any purse  or papers. She could not have been travelling that distance without, at least,  a few shillings in her possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows!&rdquo; said Julian Wyllard. &ldquo;Very narrow are  the straits of genteel poverty. If, as I suppose, she was a poor little nursery  governess going to her situation, she may have had just money enough to pay for  her railway ticket, and no more. She may have relied upon her employers meeting  her at the station with a conveyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she were a nursery governess, due at some  country house on that day, surely her employers would have communicated with  the Bodmin police before now,&rdquo; said Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;News finds its way slowly to sleepy old houses in  remote districts off the railway,&rdquo; replied Wyllard. &ldquo;There are people still  living in Cornwall who depend upon a weekly paper for all news of the outer  world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the poor girl were going to such benighted  wretches, let us hope they will wake in a day or two, and enlighten us about  her,&rdquo; said Distin. &ldquo;And now to be distinctly practical, and to tell you what I  am going to do. Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s carriage was announced nearly an hour ago, and  I saw him looking at his watch just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only uneasy about Mrs. Wyllard and my  sister. We are keeping them up rather late,&rdquo; said the Coroner apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora won&rsquo;t mind. She loves the tranquillity of  midnight,&rdquo; replied Wyllard. &ldquo;Go on, Distin. What is your plan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your adjourned inquest does not come on for nearly  a fortnight,&rdquo; said Distin. &ldquo;Now, you can&rsquo;t expect me to waste all that time in  Cornwall, delicious as it would be to dream away existence among the roses of  your delightful garden; so the best thing I can do is to run up to London  to-morrow morning&rdquo; &mdash; he spoke as if he were at Maidenhead or Marlow&mdash; &ldquo;find out  all I can <em>there</em>, and return here in  time for the Coroner&rsquo;s next sitting. By which time,&rdquo; added the specialist  cheerily, &ldquo;I hope we shall have got up a pretty little case for the Public  Prosecutor. Mr. Heathcote will kindly keep me informed of any new details that  crop up here. I shall have the poor little girl&rsquo;s photograph in my pocket-book.  You&rsquo;ll send a messenger to your town early to-morrow morning, Wyllard, and tell  the photographer to meet me at the station with his photographs of the dead girl?  He ought to have them ready by that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will give the order to-night,&rdquo; said Wyllard; and  then the three men repaired to the drawing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been very happy here,&rdquo; said Hilda to her  brother; &ldquo;but I thought you were never coming for me. Mrs. Wyllard must be  dreadfully tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never tired of your company, Hilda,&rdquo; interjected  Dora. &ldquo;Nor of Schubert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as for Mr. Grahame, he has been asleep ever  since dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a baseless calumny, Miss Heathcote. I have  not lost a note of your songs. I am told that Schubert was rather a low person  &mdash; convivial, that is to say somewhat Bohemian; fond of taverns and tavern  company. But I will maintain there must have been a pure and beautiful soul in  the man who wrote such songs as those.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you like them,&rdquo; answered Hilda,  brightening at his praise. &ldquo;I daresay you often heard them in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the people I knew in India had not such good  taste as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in a country like that, where ladies have so  little to do, music must be such a resource,&rdquo; persisted Hilda, who was  curiously interested in Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s Indian experiences.</p>
<p>She was always wondering what his life had been  like in that strange distant world, what kind of people he had known there. She  wondered all the more perhaps on account of Bothwell&rsquo;s reticence. She could  never get him to talk freely of his Indian days, and this gave the whole thing  an air of mystery.</p>
<p>The clock in the great gray pile of stabling was  striking twelve as the Coroner&rsquo;s carriage drove away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think what has happened to Mr. Grahame,&rdquo;  said Hilda. &ldquo;He used to be so lively, and now he is so dull.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change is palpable to others, then, as well as  to me,&rdquo; thought Heathcote. &ldquo;Whatever the cause may be, there is a change. God  help him if my fear is well grounded! If I were a criminal, I would as soon  have a sleuthhound on my track as Joseph Distin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Distin was on his way to London before noon  next day, curled up in a corner of a <em>coup&eacute;</em>,  looking out eagerly at every station for the morning papers. He had the dead  girl&rsquo;s photographs &mdash; full-face, profile &mdash; in his letter-case. On making his  adieux at Penmorval he declared that he had thoroughly enjoyed his little run  into the country, his night in the fresh air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So delicious to wake at six &mdash; my usual hour &mdash; and  smell your roses, and hear your fountain,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I look forward with  delight to my return the week after next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During that interval which occurred between Mr.  Distin&rsquo;s departure and the adjourned inquest, Edward Heathcote gave himself up  to his usual avocations, and took no further trouble to fathom the mystery of  the stranger&rsquo;s untimely fate. After all, he told himself, wearied by brooding  upon a subject that troubled him greatly, it was not for him to solve the  problem. He was not the Public Prosecutor, nor was he a detective, nor even a  criminal lawyer, like Joseph Distin. His business was to hear what other people  had to say, not to hunt up evidence against anybody. His duty began when he  took his seat at an inquest, and ended when he left it. Why, then, should he  vex his mind with dark suspicions against a man who was the near kinsman, the  adopted brother, of that woman for whose sake or for whose happiness he would  have gladly died?</p>
<p>This was how Edward Heathcote argued with himself;  and it was in pursuance of this conclusion that he gave himself up to a life of  idleness during the twelve days that succeeded Mr. Distin&rsquo;s departure. He rode  far afield in the early morning, he drove with his sister and the twins in the  afternoon. He appeared at two archery meetings and three tennis-parties, a most  unusual concession to the claims of society, and he dawdled away the rest of  his existence, reading the last new books in English, French, and German, and  discussing them with Hilda&rsquo;s duenna, Theresa Meyerstein, a curious specimen of  the German Fr&auml;ulein, intensely domestic, and yet deeply learned &mdash; a woman able  to turn from Schopenhauer to strawberry jam, from Plato to plum-pudding &mdash; a  woman who knew every theory that had ever been started upon the mind and its  functions, and who could tell to a hundredweight how much coal ought to be  consumed in a gentleman&rsquo;s household. Mr. Heathcote had discovered this paragon  of domesticity and erudition, acting as deputy-manager at a boarding-house at  Baden, during the first year of his widowhood, and he brought her away from the  white slavery and the scanty remuneration of that institution to the luxury of  an English country house, and the certainty of a liberal recompense for her  labours. Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein rewarded her employer by a most thorough fidelity,  and adored Hilda and the twin daughters. Her soul had languished in a chilling  atmosphere, for lack of something to love, and she lavished the garnered  treasures of long years upon these Cornish damsels who were committed to her  care.</p>
<p>More than once during those long summer days Hilda  urged the necessity of calling at Penmorval; but her brother told her she could  go alone, or take the Fr&auml;ulein, who dearly loved a drive, and a gossip over a  cup of tea, and who was always kindly received by Mrs. Wyllard, in spite of her  short petticoats, anatomical boots, and Teutonic bonnets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can perform those small civilities without any  assistance from me,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;You women are so tremendously posted in  the details of etiquette. Now, it would never have occurred to me that because  we dined at Penmorval a few nights ago, we were strenuously bound, to call upon  Mrs. Wyllard before the end of the week. I thought that, with friends of long  standing those Draconic laws were a dead letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to say that we need be ceremonious,  Edward,&rdquo; answered Hilda, &ldquo;but I am sure Dora will expect to see us. She will  think we are forgetting her if we don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you go, dear, and let her see that you are  not forgetful, whatever I may be,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>He had a horror of entering that house of Penmorval  just now, lest he should see or hear something that would give him new cause  for suspecting Bothwell. He had a feeling that he could only cross that  threshold as the bringer of evil: and it would be a bitter thing for him to  carry evil into her home for whose peace he had prayed night and morning for  the last eight years.</p>
<p>So Hilda drove her ponies up the hill to Penmorval,  and Miss Meyerstein sat beside her in all the glory of her new bonnet, sent  from Munich by a relative, and reported as the very latest fashion in that  city. Unhappily for the success of the bonnet in Cornwall, Bodmin fashions and  Munich fashions were wide as the poles asunder. Bodmin boasted a milliner who took  in the fashion-magazines, and beguiled her clients with the idea that  everything she made for them was Parisian. The Bodmin milliner had a heavy  hand, and laid on feathers and flowers as if with a trowel; but her bonnets and  hats were light as thistledown in comparison with the art of Bavaria.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon of the adjourned inquest, and  Joseph Distin was on the scene, ready to watch the inquiry. He had arrived at  Penmorval in time for breakfast, after travelling all night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a good way of getting rid of the night,&rdquo; he  said, as he discussed a salmi of trout, caught in the stream that traversed  Penmorval Park.</p>
<p>Alone in the library with Julian Wyllard after  breakfast, the London lawyer confessed that for once in his life he had been  pretty nearly beaten. He had shown the photographs of the dead face to two of  the cleverest detectives in London &mdash; had set one to work in the east and the  other in the west, promising a liberal reward for any valuable information; and  nothing had come of their labours. One had tried every lodging-house within a  certain radius of Paddington. The other had explored the neighbourhood of  London Bridge Station, and failing there, had come as far west as Charing  Cross. The ground had been thoroughly beaten, and no likely place had been  forgotten in which a stranger of this girl&rsquo;s class could find shelter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have gone to the house of friends,&rdquo;  suggested Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she had friends in London &mdash; were they ever such  slight acquaintances even &mdash; they would have been heard of before now,&rdquo; argued  Distin. &ldquo;I take it that she was unknown to a mortal on this side of the  Channel, except the man who murdered her, and who had no doubt some very  powerful motive for wanting to get rid of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose that motive to have been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Wyllard, what a question for a clever man  to ask!&rdquo; exclaimed the lawyer, with a shade of contempt. &ldquo;To speculate upon the  motive I must have some knowledge of the man, and of this girl&rsquo;s murderer I  know nothing. If I could once find the man, I should soon find the motive. Such  a murder as this generally means the breaking of some legal tie that has become  onerous &mdash; some bond which death alone can loosen.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter4"></a>Chapter 4<br>
  Bothwell Declines To Answer</h2>
<p>The room at the Vital Spark was filled to overflowing  on the occasion of the adjourned inquiry. At the previous examination only the  inhabitants of Bodmin and its immediate neighbourhood had been present; but on  this second afternoon people had come from long distances, and there was not  standing room for the audience, which filled the passage, and waited with  strained ears to catch a stray word now and then through the open door.</p>
<p>The idea of a profound mystery &mdash; of a dastardly  crime &mdash; had been fostered in the local mind by the newspapers, which had harped  upon the ghastly theme, and gloated over the particulars of the nameless girl&rsquo;s  fate in paragraphs and leaderettes <em>ad  nauseam</em>. Articles headed &ldquo;More details concerning the Bodmin Mystery,&rdquo;  &ldquo;Further particulars about the strange death on the railway,&rdquo; had served as the  salt to give savour to cut and dried reports about the harvest, the markets,  and those small offenders whose peccadilloes furnish the material for Justice  to exercise her might upon at petty sessions.</p>
<p>Every one had read about that strange death of a  lonely girl in the summer sunset. Every one was interested in a fate so  melancholy &mdash; an abandonment so inexplicable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that there was hardly ever a human being  so isolated as to be owned by no one,&rdquo; said the curate of Wadebridge. &ldquo;Yet it would  seem that this poor girl had no one to care for her in life, or to identify her  after death. If she had one friend living in England or France, surely that  person must have made some sign before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People in France are very slow to hear about anything  that happens in England,&rdquo; replied Dr. Menheniot, to whom the curate had been  talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I heard Mr. Heathcote, at the first inquiry,  say that he meant to advertise in a Parisian newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be sure the advertisement appeared,&rdquo; answered  Menheniot. &ldquo;Heathcote is one of those few men with whom meaning and doing are  the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inquiry dragged its slow length along, and  hardly one new fact was elicited. There was a great deal of repetition, in  spite of the Coroner&rsquo;s attempt to keep all his witnesses to the point. Mr.  Distin sat near the Coroner, and asked a few questions of two or three of the  witnesses; and though he elicited no actually new facts, he seemed to put  things in a clearer light by his cross-examination.</p>
<p>Just before the close of the inquiry, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see Mr. Grahame, of Penmorval, is here this  afternoon. I should like to ask him a question or two, if you have no  objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Coroner paled ever so slightly at this  suggestion, but he had no objection to offer: so Bothwell Grahame was asked to  come up to the table, and kiss the Book, which he did with a somewhat  bewildered air, as if the thing came upon him as an unpleasant surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in the train that evening, I believe, Mr.  Grahame,&rdquo; said Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you alone, in a compartment, or in company  with other passengers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a third-class compartment to myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you saw this girl fall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her fall &mdash; but as I saw just a little less  than Dr. Menheniot and the guard saw, I don&rsquo;t see the good of my being  questioned,&rdquo; answered Bothwell, with rather a sullen air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; returned Mr. Distin suavely,  &ldquo;every witness sees an event from a different point of view. You may have  noticed something which escaped the two witnesses we have just heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed nothing more than you have been told by  these two, and I saw less than they saw. I did not look out of the window till  I heard the girl&rsquo;s shriek, and I saw her in the act of falling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. But you may have observed this solitary girl  &mdash; a foreigner, and therefore more noticeable &mdash; on the platform at Plymouth. You  were on the platform at Plymouth, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was. But I did not see the girl at the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange that she should have escaped your  observation, although the porter who was busy with his duties had time to  notice her,&rdquo; said Mr. Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it surprise you to hear that during the four  or five minutes I spent in the station before the train started I was standing  at the bookstall buying papers, with my back to the platform?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would account for your not having seen this  noticeable young stranger. You were in Plymouth for several hours, I believe,  Mr. Grahame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was; but upon my word I don&rsquo;t see what hearing  that fact can have upon this inquiry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not. Still, you will not object to tell us  what you were doing in Plymouth &mdash; how you disposed of your time there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This question evidently troubled Bothwell, simple  as it was, and easy as it ought to have been to answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I played a game at billiards at the Duke of  Cornwall,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you are too good a player for that to  occupy more than half an hour,&rdquo; said Mr. Distin, with his silky air, as if he  were employed in a very pleasant business, and were bent upon being as cheery  as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to wait for the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Mr. Grahame, you need not be mysterious  about so simple a matter,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Distin. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to tell us  that you went to Plymouth by the 12.15 train&rdquo; &mdash; he had ascertained this fact  before the inquiry began&mdash; &ldquo;and spent the whole of the day there, in order to  play a game at billiards in a public billiard-room. You must have had other  business in Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. I had other business there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you kindly tell us what that business was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As it concerned others besides myself, and as it  has not the faintest bearing upon this case, I must decline to answer that  question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, now, I should advise you to be more frank.  You leave Bodmin early in the day &mdash; without giving any notice of your departure  &mdash; and you return late in the evening. A most mysterious catastrophe occurs in  the train which brings you home &mdash; a death so strange, so horrible, that it  casts a cloud over all the passengers travelling by that train &mdash; leaves a  stigma upon all, as it were, until the guilt of that deed can be brought home  to one. Surely, under such circumstances, the utmost frankness is desirable.  Every traveller in that train should be ready to answer any question which  those who are charged with the elucidation of this mystery may ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have answered your questions as to what occurred  to me in the train, and at the station; but I decline to be catechised about my  business in Plymouth,&rdquo; answered Bothwell doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said Distin; and Bothwell went to  his seat next Julian Wyllard, whose handsome presence appeared in the front  rank of spectators, amongst those of the <em>&eacute;lite</em> who were favoured with chairs, while the commonalty stood in a mob at the back  of the room.</p>
<p>The audience had been breathless during this  examination of Bothwell Grahame. The young man&rsquo;s sunburnt face was clouded with  anger, his dark strongly-marked brows were scowling over those gray-blue eyes  which once had such a pleasant expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think what has come to Grahame,&rdquo; muttered  a sporting squire to his next neighbour. &ldquo;He used to be such a pleasant fellow,  but to-day he looks like a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he threw the girl out of the  train, do you?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God forbid! But by that London lawyer&rsquo;s questions  one would think <em>he</em> suspected Grahame  of having had a hand in the business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The jury gave their verdict presently, &ldquo;Death from  misadventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Dora not to expect me at dinner,&rdquo; said  Bothwell to Julian Wyllard, before they left the inn; &ldquo;I shall dine in Bodmin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I can easily make one. I am not going to  break bread with your lawyer friend. So long as he is at Penmorval I shall be  missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Bothwell, you have no right to be angry at  a simple question which you might have so easily answered,&rdquo; remonstrated  Wyllard gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a question which I did not choose to  answer, and which he had no right to ask. It was an outrage to ask such a  question &mdash; to press it as he did. Fifty years ago he might have been shot for a  lesser insult. By Jove, I never felt more sorry that the good old duelling days  are over &mdash; the days when one man could not insult another with impunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How savage you are, Bothwell, and against a man  who was only in the exercise of his profession!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no right to question me as if I were a  murderer,&rdquo; retorted Bothwell savagely. &ldquo;Did he think that I spent my time in  Plymouth plotting that girl&rsquo;s death? If I had made up my mind to push a woman  over an embankment, I should not have wanted to spend a day in Plymouth in  order to plan the business. A murder of that kind must be touch and go &mdash; no  sooner thought of than done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All trouble would have been saved, my dear fellow,  if you had given a straight answer to a simple question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To answer would have been to acknowledge his right  to question me. No judge would have allowed counsel to have asked such a  motiveless question. Nowhere except at a petty rustic inquiry would such a  thing be permitted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only say that you are needlessly angry,  Bothwell,&rdquo; said Wyllard. &ldquo;Here comes Distin. You had better drive home with  us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, thank you; I shall be home before the house  shuts up; but you&rsquo;ll see no more of me to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Penmorval barouche was waiting before the porch  of the Vital Spark &mdash; a great day for that rural hostelry when such a carriage  could be seen waiting there &mdash; a great day at the bar, where all the strength of  the establishment could not serve brandies-and-sodas and pale ales fast enough.  Joseph Distin came tripping out, and took his place in the carriage beside  Julian Wyllard. He had lingered at the inn for a few minutes&rsquo; talk with the  Coroner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not Mr. Grahame going back with us?&rdquo; he asked,  as they drove towards the town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You wounded his dignity by those questions of  yours. He is a curious young man, and is easily offended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a very curious young man,&rdquo; answered the  lawyer, with a thoughtful air.</p>
<p>He was looking at the landscape intently as they  drove along the shady road, between deep banks and luxuriant hedges; but he  would have found it rather difficult to say afterwards what kind of timber  prevailed in the hedgerows, or what crops grew in the fields.</p>
<p>He was thoughtful all that evening, though he did  his utmost to make himself agreeable to Mrs. Wyllard at dinner, talking to her  of art, music, the drama, society, all the arts and graces and pleasures of  life &mdash; doing everything in his power to distract her thoughts from that one  grim theme which was the motive of his presence in that place.</p>
<p>When she was gone, and Distin and his host were  alone together over their claret, the lawyer dropped his society manner as if  it had been a mask, and began to talk seriously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the first time for a good many years I find  myself completely at fault,&rdquo; he said, leaning across the table, and cracking  filberts in sheer distraction of mind. &ldquo;I thought that I should be able to get  up a case while I was in London, but not a shred of evidence have I discovered.  If this girl had dropped from the moon, it could not be more difficult to trace  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear Distin, you have done your best, and  we must be satisfied,&rdquo; replied Wyllard quietly. &ldquo;I felt it to be my duty as a  magistrate to do all in my power to fathom the mystery of that poor girl&rsquo;s  death. The best thing I could do was to put the case in your hands. If you  cannot help us, no one can. We must be satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not satisfied, Julian; I never shall be  satisfied until I have solved this problem,&rdquo; said Distin resolutely. &ldquo;I am not  the sort of man who can stand being baffled in a matter of this kind. Is all my  professional training to go for nothing, do you think? And yet in your interest  it might be best that I should let this business drop out of my mind &mdash; forget  the whole story if possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean, in <em>my</em> interest?&rdquo; exclaimed Wyllard, surprised. &ldquo;What bearing can the  case have upon me or my interest, beyond my desire to do my duty as a  magistrate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that this mystery touches you nearer than  you suppose. Surely, Wyllard, you must have been struck by the manner of your  wife&rsquo;s kinsman under my examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; cried Wyllard, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to  tell me that you suspect Bothwell Grahame of any hand in this business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In perfect frankness, between man and man, I  believe that young man to be in some way &mdash; either as principal or accessory &mdash;  concerned in the murder of that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Distin, you must be mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, my dear Wyllard, you cannot pretend that  you did not notice the strangeness of Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s manner this afternoon: his  refusal to answer my question about his business in Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was angry at your catechising him in that  manner; and I must confess that your question appeared to the last degree  irrelevant, even to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Granted. My question was irrelevant. But it was a  test question. I should never have cross-examined Mr. Grahame, if I had not  seen reason for suspecting him before the inquiry began. I was painfully  impressed by his manner the night I dined here with him; and I believe, from  certain indications dropped unconsciously by your Coroner, that he too saw  reason for suspecting Mr. Grahame. His manner to-day confirms my suspicion. I  am deeply grieved that it should be so, on your wife&rsquo;s account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had need be sorry for her. Why, Bothwell is  like a brother to her. It would break her heart,&rdquo; said Wyllard, strongly  agitated.</p>
<p>He had risen from the table, and was walking slowly  up and down the room, between the windows opening wide upon the gray evening  sky, and the warm lamplight within. Joseph Distin could not see his face, but  he could see that he was strongly moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, let us hope that Mrs. Wyllard will  never know anything about this suspicion of mine,&rdquo; said Distin soothingly. &ldquo;I  have &mdash; so far &mdash; not one scrap of evidence against Mr. Grahame; except the  evidence of looks and manner, and the one fact of his refusal to say what he  was doing in Plymouth the day of the girl&rsquo;s death. There is nothing in all that  to bring a man to the gallows. I may have my own ideas about this mystery, and  Mr. Heathcote may have pretty much the same notion, but there is nothing to  touch your wife&rsquo;s cousin so far. I shall go back to town, and try to forget the  whole matter. All you have to do is to keep your own counsel, and take care  that Mrs. Wyllard knows nothing of what has passed in strictest confidence between  you and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not have her know it for worlds. It would  break her heart; it might kill her. Women cannot bear such shocks. And to think  that a man can be suspected of a crime on such grounds &mdash; suspected by you, a  student of crime and criminals &mdash; because of a moody manner, a refusal to answer  a question! The whole thing seems too absurd for belief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that the thing is absurd, and that for once in  his life Joe Distin has made a fool of himself. Take your wife to Aix-les-Bains  &mdash; or to Biarritz &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard started at that last word as if he  had been stung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is the matter with you, or with  Biarritz?&rdquo; asked Distin sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. My mind was wandering, that&rsquo;s all. You  were saying &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you had better forget all that has passed  between us to-night &mdash; forget the death of that girl &mdash; make a clean slate. Take  your wife to some foreign watering-place, the brightest and gayest you can  find. And let Bothwell Grahame dree his weird as best he may. The catastrophe  on the railway will be forgotten in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt it. We have not much to think about at  Bodmin, and we exaggerate all our molehills into mountains. That girl&rsquo;s death  will be the talk of the town for the next six months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet people go on existing in such places, and  think they are alive!&rdquo; exclaimed Distin.</p>
<p>He left Penmorval after breakfast next morning,  without having seen Bothwell, who was out on the hills breaking in a new horse  while the family were at breakfast. He had been out since five o&rsquo;clock, the  butler told Mrs. Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he riding Glencoe?&rdquo; she asked, with a look of  alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a dreadful horse, I know, Julian,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Manby told me about him only yesterday. He had narrowly escaped being thrown  the day before; and he said that Glencoe was a really dangerous horse, and that  we ought to get rid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that he may break somebody else&rsquo;s bones,&rdquo;  suggested Mr. Distin. &ldquo;That is what a good coachman always advises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now Bothwell has gone out on him, alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not have him take some one to pick him  up if he were thrown,&rdquo; said Wyllard. &ldquo;My dear Dora, there is not the slightest  occasion for alarm. The horse is young, and a little gay; but your cousin  excels as a rough-rider, and there will be no harm done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why should he want to ride that horse?&rdquo; said  Dora; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure Manby would advise him not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very reason why he should do it,&rdquo; replied her  husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if he is trying to kill himself while I  am eating my breakfast calmly here?&rdquo; speculated Joseph Distin. &ldquo;He must know  that I suspect him; and he may think that the game is up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whatever Bothwell&rsquo;s intention might have been, he  came back to Penmorval before eleven o&rsquo;clock, bringing home the big bay hunter  bathed in sweat, and as tame as a sheep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine, honest horse! Only wants riding,&rdquo; he said,  as he flung the bridle to the groom, who had been watching for him at the  stable-gates, with an air of expecting to see broken bones.</p>
<p>In the hall Bothwell met Dora, cool, and calm, and  beautiful, in her white muslin breakfast gown. She was bringing in a basket of  flowers from the hothouse, to be arranged by her own hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that London lawyer gone yet?&rdquo; asked Bothwell  curtly.</p>
<p>He could not be civil even to his cousin when he  spoke of Joseph Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has gone &mdash; I hope, never to come back  again,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;He is really a very well-bred man, and he made himself most  agreeable here; but he seemed to bring with him an atmosphere of crime. I could  not help thinking of all the horrible cases he must have been concerned in, and  that he had grown rich by the crimes of mankind. He could find out nothing  about that poor girl&rsquo;s death, it seems, although he is so clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which goes rather to establish my view that the  girl fell out of the train by accident,&rdquo; replied Bothwell.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter5"></a>Chapter 5<br>
  People Will Talk</h2>
<p>The year was a month older since Joseph Distin went  back to town, baffled and angry with himself, yet glad for his friend&rsquo;s sake  that his discoveries had gone no further. The heather was purpling on the  hills, where the dwarf furze flashed here and there into patches of gold. The  tourist season had set in; but the tourist for the most part avoided the little  town of Bodmin, nestling snugly inland among the hills, and turned his face to  the sea, and the wild rocks which defend that romantic western coast, to the  Lizard and the Land&rsquo;s End, to rugged Tintagel and sandy Bude.</p>
<p>Life at Penmorval had drifted by as calmly as an  infant&rsquo;s sleep, in those four weeks of soft summer weather. There had been no  visitors staying in the house, for both Julian Wyllard and his wife loved a  studious repose, and there were long intervals in which they lived almost  alone. Penmorval would be full by and by, in October, when the  pheasant-shooting began; and in the mean time it was pleasant to Dora Wyllard  to be able to ride and drive with her husband &mdash; to be the companion of his  walks, to read the books he read, and to waste long evenings in inexhaustible  talk. They always had so much to say to each other. The sympathy between them  was so complete.</p>
<p>Hilda Heathcote was at Penmorval nearly every day.  She ranked almost as one of the family. She came to Mrs. Wyllard for counsel  and instruction upon all manner of subjects &mdash; sometimes for a gardening lesson,  sometimes for a lesson in crewel-work, in French, German, Italian. Dora was in  advance of her young friend in all these subjects; but the pupil was so bright  and quick that it was a pleasure to teach her. Between them Mrs. Wyllard and  Miss Heathcote achieved marvels in the way of art-needlework &mdash; piano-backs which  were as beautiful as pictures, porti&egrave;res worthy to rank with the highest  examples of Gobelin tapestry, counterpanes that ought to have been exhibited at  South Kensington. The calm leisure of country life lent itself to such slow and  elaborate labours.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard had a big box of foreign books once a  month from Rolandi&rsquo;s library, and she meted out to Hilda such volumes as were  fit for a young English lady&rsquo;s perusal; and then they met to talk over the  books, sometimes alone, sometimes with Bothwell as a third. Bothwell was very  scornful of all the sentimental books, laughed at the super-refined heroines of  French novels, the dreamy heroes of German romance; but he read all the books  that Hilda read, and he seemed to enjoy talking about them at that protracted  function of afternoon tea from which he rarely absented himself.</p>
<p>The weather was peerless during this month of  August, and Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s afternoon tea-table was set out in an arbour of  clipped yew, at the end of the Italian garden, a point from which there was a  fine view of the moors, and the great brown hills beyond.</p>
<p>Bothwell&rsquo;s sullen gloom had passed away soon after  Mr. Distin&rsquo;s departure. He seemed to Hilda to have become once again the old  Bothwell &mdash; gay, and cheery, and kind, and frank. But he did not commit himself  by any of those delicate little attentions to Hilda which had made him such an  agreeable person half a year ago. That particular phase of his character was a  thing of the past.</p>
<p>A month had gone since the close of the inquest at  the Vital Spark, but Bodmin people had not forgotten the strange death of the  nameless girl, and had not left off talking about it. They talked about  Bothwell, too, and of his refusal to give a plain answer to a plain question;  and towards the end of that month Bothwell Grahame woke up all at once to the  consciousness that he was under a cloud. He discovered that he was being cut by  his old acquaintances, so far as they dared cut a man of his standing and  temperament. They were not uncivil; they gave him good-day if they met him in  the street; they would even deign to discuss the state of the weather, the  results of the harvest. But Bothwell felt nevertheless that he was living under  a cloud; there was a tacit avoidance of him, a desire to get off with as slight  a greeting as civility would permit. Hands were no longer held out to him in  friendship; salutations were no longer loud and cheery. No one asked him to  stop and play billiards at the chief inn, as people had been wont to do,  waylaying him when he wanted to get home. Now he could pursue his walk without  let or hindrance. He had even seen one of his most familiar friends stroll  dreamily round a corner to avoid meeting him.</p>
<p>During the whole of those four weeks he had not  received a single invitation to play lawn-tennis, he for whose presence  tennis-parties used to compete. There were two or three engagements outstanding  at the time of the inquest. He had kept these, and had played his best,  struggling against a coldness in the atmosphere. It had seemed to him that  everybody was out of sorts. There was an all-pervading dulness. Nobody could  find anything pleasant to talk about. He had been very slow to perceive that  cloud which hung over him: but by the end of the month the fact had become too  palpable, and Bothwell Grahame understood that he had been sent to Coventry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it all mean?&rdquo; he asked himself, aghast  with indignant wonder. &ldquo;What can they have to say against me? Can any one have  found out &mdash; ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell&rsquo;s cheek paled as he thought of that one  transaction of his life which he would least like to see recorded against him.  But he told himself, after a few minutes&rsquo; reflection, that nobody in Bodmin  could possibly know anything about that particular episode in a young man&rsquo;s  history.</p>
<p>He puzzled himself sorely about this change in the  manner of his acquaintance; and on trying back he discovered that the change  dated from the day of the adjourned inquest. He recalled too the curious manner  in which everybody had avoided the subject of the inquest; how when any mention  of the dead girl had been made in his presence the conversation had been  changed instantly, as if the subject must needs be tabooed before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my soul,&rdquo; said Bothwell, &ldquo;I begin to think  they suspect me of having thrown that girl out of the carriage. Because I  refused to answer that insolent ruffian&rsquo;s questions, these village wiseacres  have made up their minds that I am a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went back to Penmorval in a white heat of  indignation. A week ago he had made up his mind to start for Peru. He had found  out all about the steamer which was to carry him. He had obtained letters of  introduction to the proprietor of a newspaper, and to some of the local  aristocracy. He was ready to set forth upon his quest of fortune in the land of  gold and jewels. But now he told himself that wild horses should not drag him  away from Penmorval. He would stand his ground until he had humiliated those  fools and rascals whom he had once called his friends. He would make them taste  of the cup of their own folly.</p>
<p>He was much too hot-headed to keep the secret of  his wrongs from that cousin who had been to him as a sister. He went straight  to Dora, and told her of the foul suspicion that had arisen in men&rsquo;s minds  against him.</p>
<p>She had read the report of the inquest, and  although she had wondered at his refusal to answer Mr. Distin&rsquo;s questions, she  had been able to understand that his pride might revolt against being so  catechised, and that he might choose to persist in that refusal as a point of  personal dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one who can suspect you for such a reason &mdash;  any one who could suspect you for any reason &mdash; must be an idiot, Bothwell,&rdquo; she  exclaimed. &ldquo;There is no use in being angry with such people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am angry with them. I am rabid with anger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not answer that question, Bothwell?&rdquo;  asked his cousin thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I did not choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet it would have prevented all possibility of  misapprehension if you had given a straight answer. And it would have been so  easy,&rdquo; argued Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would not have been easy. It was not possible  to answer that question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I could not answer it without injuring  some one I &mdash; esteem,&rdquo; replied Bothwell, relapsing into that curious, sullen  manner which Mr. Heathcote had observed on the day of the inquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Bothwell, you have secrets, then &mdash; a secret from  me, your adopted sister!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have my secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry. I used to hope that I should have a  share in the planning of your life; and now I begin to fear &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That my life is wrecked already. You are right,  Dora. My life was wrecked three years before I left India, but I did not know  then what shipwreck meant. I thought that there was land ahead, and that I  should make it; but I know now I was drifting towards a fatal rock upon which  honour, happiness, and prosperity must needs go to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk in riddles, Bothwell. Tell me the plain  truth, however bad it may be. You know you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, dear soul, as I trust Heaven itself. But  there are some things a man must not tell. Yes, Dora, I have my secret, and it  is a hard one to carry &mdash; the secret of a man who is bound in honour to one  woman while he fondly loves another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell, I am so sorry for you,&rdquo; said his cousin  softly.</p>
<p>She put her arms round his neck as if they had  still been boy and girl. She put her lips to his fevered forehead. She  comforted him with her love, being able to give him no other comfort.</p>
<p>Hilda Heathcote came up the avenue ten minutes  later, escorting a matchless donkey, which was of so pale a gray as to be almost  white. It was a donkey of surpassing size and dignity, and gave itself as many  airs as if it had been a white elephant. It carried a pair of panniers, highly  decorated in a Moorish fashion, and in the Moorish panniers sat Edward  Heathcote&rsquo;s twin daughters.</p>
<p>The twins were as like as the famous Corsican  Brothers in person, but they were utterly unlike in disposition, and the blue  and pink sashes which they wore for distinction were quite unnecessary; since  no one could have mistaken Minnie, the overbearing twin, for Jennie, the meek  twin. People only had to be in their company half an hour to know which was  which for ever after. Whereas Jennie was quite a baby, and could hardly speak  plain, Minnie was preternaturally old for her years, and expressed her opinion  freely upon every subject. Minnie always came to the front, was always mistress  of the situation, and where Jennie shed tears Minnie always stamped her foot.  Needless to say that Minnie was everybody&rsquo;s favourite. Naughtiness at four  years old, a termagant in miniature, is always interesting. Mr. Heathcote was  the only person in Cornwall who could manage Minnie, and who properly  appreciated Jennie&rsquo;s yielding nature. Jennie felt that her father loved her,  and used to climb on to his knee and nestle in his waistcoat; while Minnie was  charming society by those little airs and graces which were spoken of vaguely  as &ldquo;showing off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-day Minnie was in a delightful humour, for she  was being escorted in triumph to a long-promised festival. Since the very beginning  of the summer the twins had been promised that they should go to drink tea with  Mrs. Wyllard some day when they had been very good. Jennie had done everything  to deserve the favour; but Minnie had offended in somewise every day. She had  been cruel to the dogs &mdash; she had made an archipelago of blots in her copybook,  while her pothooks and hangers were a worse company of cripples than Falstaff&rsquo;s  regiment. She had been rude to the kind Fr&auml;ulein. She had been rebellious at  dinner, had protested with loud wailings against the severity of seven-o&rsquo;clock  bed. Only towards the end of August had there come a brief interval of calm,  and Hilda had been quick to take advantage of these halcyon days, knowing how  soon they would be followed by storm.</p>
<p>The tea-table was laid in the yew-tree arbour, such  a table as little children love, and which has an attractive air even to  full-grown humanity. Such a delicious variety of cakes and jams and home-made  bread, such nectarines and grapes. Minnie shouted and clapped her hands at  sight of the feast, while Jennie blushed and hung her head, abashed at the  dazzling apparition of Mrs. Wyllard in an Indian silk gown with a scarlet sash,  and flashing diamond rings. Hilda had no such jewels on her sunburnt fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a nice tea!&rdquo; cried Minnie, when the blue and  the pink twin had each been provided with a comfortable seat, each in a snug  corner of the arbour, banked in by the tea-table. &ldquo;Why do we never have such  nice teas at home? Why don&rsquo;t we, Aunt Hilda?&rdquo; she repeated, when her question  had been ignored for a couple of seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because such nice things would not be wholesome  every day,&rdquo; replied Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that,&rdquo; said Minnie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Minnie!&rdquo; cried Jennie, with a shocked air. &ldquo;You  mustn&rsquo;t contradict people. You mustn&rsquo;t contradict Aunt Hilda, because she is  old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If cakes weren&rsquo;t wholesome <em>she</em> wouldn&rsquo;t have them,&rdquo; said Minnie, ignoring the blue twin&rsquo;s  interruption, and pointing her chubby finger at Mrs. Wyllard. &ldquo;She can have  what she likes, and she is grown up and knows everything. She wouldn&rsquo;t give us  unwholesome things. I know why we don&rsquo;t have such nice teas at home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, Minnie?&rdquo; asked Dora, to encourage  conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because Fr&auml;ulein is too stingy. I heard cook say  so the other day. She is always grumbling about the cream and butter. You don&rsquo;t  grumble about the cream and butter, do you?&rdquo; she asked, in her point-blank way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not so good a housekeeper as the  Fr&auml;ulein,&rdquo; answered Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I like bad housekeepers best. I shall be a  bad housekeeper when I grow up, and there shall always be cakes for tea &mdash; ever  so many cakes, as there are here. I&rsquo;ll have some of that, please,&rdquo; pointing to  an amber-tinted pound-cake, &ldquo;first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this Minnie signified that she meant to eat her  way through the varieties of the tea-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what will Jennie take?&rdquo; asked Dora, smiling at  the blue twin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jennie&rsquo;s a bilious child,&rdquo; said Minnie  authoritatively; &ldquo;she ought to have something plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jennie, with her large blue eyes fixed pathetically  on the pound-cake, waited for whatever might be given to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think just one slice of rich cake would  make you ill, Jennie?&rdquo; asked Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure it would,&rdquo; said Minnie, ploughing her  way through her own slice. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s always sick, if she eats rich things. She was  sick when we went to see grandma. Grandma isn&rsquo;t rich, you know, because her  husband was a clergyman, and they&rsquo;re always poor. But she gives us beautiful  teas when we go to see her, and lets us run about her garden and pick the  fruit, and trample on the beds, and do just as we like; so we don&rsquo;t mind going  to tea with grandma, though she&rsquo;s old and deaf. Jennie had cherries and  pound-cake the last time we went to see grandma, and she was ill all night. You  know you were, Jennie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue twin admitted the fact, and meekly  accepted a hunch of sanitarian sponge-cake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not talk so much, Minnie; you are a  perfect nuisance,&rdquo; said Hilda; and then she looked round hesitatingly once or  twice before she asked, &ldquo;What has become of Mr. Grahame? He generally honours  us with his company at afternoon tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell has been a little worried this morning,&rdquo;  faltered Dora. &ldquo;He is not very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart sank within her at the thought that this  girl &mdash; this girl whom she had once thought of as Bothwell&rsquo;s future wife &mdash; would  come in time to know the dark suspicion which hung over him like a poisonous  cloud. She would be told by and by that people thought of him as a possible  murderer, a wretch who had assailed a defenceless girl, set upon her as a tiger  on his prey, hurled her to a dreadful death. She would learn that there were  people in the neighbourhood capable of suspecting this very Bothwell Grahame,  gentleman and soldier, of so dastardly a crime.</p>
<p>Dora had hardly been able to realise the awfulness  of the situation yet. In her desire to comfort her cousin she had made light of  the unspoken slander, the cruel taint which had been breathed upon his name.  But now as she sat at her tea-table ministering to her two little guests,  trying to appear interested in their prattle, her heart was aching as it had  not ached since she had been forgiven by Edward Heathcote. From that hour until  the strange girl&rsquo;s death her life had been cloudless. And now a cloud had  drifted across her horizon, darkening the sunlight: a cloud that hung heavily  over the head of one whom she dearly loved.</p>

  A Clerical Warning</h2>
<p>The children&rsquo;s tea-party lasted a long time, and  the twins enjoyed themselves prodigiously in the yew-tree arbour, albeit both  their hostess and their aunt were curiously absent-minded, and returned vaguest  answers to Minnie&rsquo;s continuous prattle, and to occasional remarks propounded  gravely by Jennie between two mouthfuls of cake.</p>
<p>Perhaps the twins enjoyed themselves all the more  under this condition of things, for they were allowed to range at will from one  dainty to another, and were not worried by those troublesome suggestions of  unwholesomeness, which are apt to harass juvenile gourmands.</p>
<p>Tea was over at last, and then they had a game at  ball on the grass in front of the fountain; after that they fed the gold fish,  until Hilda began to talk of getting them home. It was nearly seven o&rsquo;clock by  this time, and Bothwell had not appeared.</p>
<p>The whole business seemed flat, stale, and  unprofitable to Hilda, for want of that familiar presence. He had been such a  pleasant companion of late &mdash; not attentive or flattering of speech, as young  men are to girls they admire. He had said none of those pretty things which  call up blushes in girlish cheeks; but he had been kind and brotherly, and Hilda  was satisfied to accept such kindness from him. She thought it even more than  her due. She was not what is called a high-spirited girl. She did not expect  men to bow down and worship her; she did not expect that hearts were to be laid  at her feet for her to trample upon them. She had none of the insolence of  conscious beauty. If ever she were to love, it would be secretly, meekly,  patiently, as Shakespeare&rsquo;s Helena loved Bertram, with a gentle upward-looking  affection, deeming her lover remote and superior as a star.</p>
<p>There had been a time when she thought that  Bothwell cared for her a little, and then he had been to her as Bertram. Now he  was kind and brotherly, and she was grateful for his kindness.</p>
<p>She was somewhat heavy-hearted as she arranged her  disordered hair &mdash; rumpled in a final game of romps with the twins &mdash; and put on  her hat to go home. The donkey was waiting before the old stone porch, and  Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein had come to assist in escorting the twins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought Minnie might be troublesome after tea,&rdquo;  she said, as if tea had the effect of champagne upon Minnie&rsquo;s temperament.</p>
<p>They set out across the fields in the warm glow of  evening sunlight, a little procession &mdash; the children full of talk and laughter,  Hilda more silent than usual. It was harvest-time, and the corn stood in  sheaves in one wide field by which they went, a field on the slope of a hill on  the edge of the moorland. On the lower side of the field there was a tall  overgrown hedge; a hedge full of the glow of sunshine and the colour of wild  flowers, red and blue and yellow, an exuberance of starry golden flowers,  scattered everywhere amidst the tangle of foliage.</p>
<p>There was a gap here and there in the hedge, where  cattle or farm-labourers had made a way for themselves from field to field, and  through one of these gaps a man scrambled, and jumped into the path just in  front of the donkey.</p>
<p>The animal gave a feeble shy, and the twins  screamed, first with surprise and then with pleasure. The man was Bothwell,  whom the twins adored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come to tea?&rdquo; asked Minnie  indignantly. &ldquo;It was very naughty of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was out of temper, Minnie; not fit company for  nice people. How do you do, Hilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had fallen into the way of calling her by her  Christian name almost from the beginning of their acquaintance; in those days  when he had been so much brighter and happier than he seemed to be now.</p>
<p>The donkey jogged on, carrying off the twins,  Minnie holding forth all the time, lecturing Bothwell for his rudeness. The  Fr&auml;ulein followed, eager to protect her charges. They were only a few paces in  advance, but Hilda felt as if she were alone with Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the children have had their long-promised  tea-party,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I was out of it. Hard lines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They missed you very much,&rdquo; said Hilda. &ldquo;But did  not you know it was to be this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew yesterday &mdash; Dora told me,&rdquo; answered  Bothwell, hitting the wild flowers savagely with his cane, as he walked by  Hilda&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>Unconsciously they had fallen into a much slower  pace than the Fr&auml;ulein and the donkey, and they were quite alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew all about the tea-party, and I meant to be  with you; and then something went wrong with me this morning, and I felt only  fit company for devils. If Satan had been giving a tea-party anywhere within  reach, I would have gone to <em>that</em>,&rdquo;  concluded Bothwell vindictively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad Satan does not give tea-parties in  Cornwall. Of course you know that he would never trust himself in our county,  for fear our Cornish cooks should make him into a pie,&rdquo; answered Hilda, trying  to smile. &ldquo;But I am very sorry to hear you have been worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My life has been made up of worries for the last  six months. I try sometimes to be cheerful &mdash; reckless rather &mdash; and to forget;  and then the viper begins to bite again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda would have given much to be able to comfort  him. It seemed almost as if he looked to her for comfort, and yet what could  she say to a man whose troubles she knew not, who kept his own secret, and  hardened his heart against his friends?</p>
<p>They walked on in silence for a little way. Some of  the reapers were going homeward in the soft evening light; there was a great  wain being loaded a field or two off, and the voices of men and women sounded  clear and musical through the summer stillness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be sorry for a man who had brought  trouble on himself from his own folly, from his own wrong-doing, Hilda?&rdquo;  Bothwell asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be all the more sorry for him on that  account,&rdquo; she answered gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you would pity him. Such women as you and  Dora are angels of compassion. They never withhold their pity; but it is  tempered with scorn. They despise the sinner, even while they are merciful to  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to say that. I am not given to  despising people. I am too conscious of my own shortcomings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an angel,&rdquo; said Bothwell piteously. &ldquo;O  Hilda, how much I have lost in life &mdash; how many golden opportunities I have  wasted!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are always other opportunities to be found,&rdquo;  answered the girl, trying to speak words of comfort, vaguely, hopelessly, in  her utter ignorance of his griefs or his perplexities. &ldquo;There is always the  future, and the chance of beginning again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in Queensland, in the Fijis, in Peru. If you  mean that I may some day learn to make my own living, I grant the possibility.  Queensland or Peru may do something for me. But my chances of happiness, my  chances of renown &mdash; those are gone for ever. I lost all when I left the army.  At seven-and-twenty I am a broken man. Hard for a man to feel that this life is  all over and done with before he is thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancy there must be a time in every life when  the clouds seem to shut out the sun; but the darkness does not last for ever,&rdquo;  said Hilda softly. &ldquo;I hope the cloud may pass from your sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, if it would, Hilda &mdash; if that cloud could pass  and leave me my own man again, as I was nine years ago, before I went to  India!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seemed to be very happy last winter &mdash; in the  hunting season,&rdquo; said Hilda, trying to speak lightly, though her heart was  beating as furiously as if she had been climbing a mountain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was happy then. I allowed myself to forget.  I did not know just then that the trouble I had taken upon my shoulders was a  lifelong trouble. Yes, it was a happy time, Hilda, last winter. How many a  glorious day we had together across country! You and I were always in the first  flight, and generally near each other. Our horses were always such good  friends, were they not? They loved to gallop neck-and-neck. O my darling, I was  indeed happy in those days &mdash; unspeakably happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had forgotten all prudence, all self-restraint,  in a moment. He had taken Hilda&rsquo;s hand and lifted it to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dear one, let me tell you how I love you,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;I may never dare say more than that, perhaps, but it is true, and you  shall hear it, if only once. Yes, Hilda, I love you. I have loved you ever  since last winter, when you and I used to ride after the hounds together. O,  those happy winter days, those long waits at the corners of lanes, or in dusky  thickets, or on the bleak bare common! I shall never forget them. Do you think  I cared what became of the fox in those days, or whether we were after the  right or the wrong one? Not a jot, dear. The veriest tailor that ever hung on  to a horse could have cared no less for the sport than I. It was your sweet  face I loved, and your friendly voice, and the light touch of your little hand.  I was full of hope in those days, Hilda; and then a cloud came over my horizon  and I dared hope no more. I never meant to tell you &mdash; I knew I had no right to  tell you this; but my feelings were too strong for me just now. Will you  forgive me, Hilda, that I, who dare not ask you to be my wife, have dared to  tell you of my love? Can you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to forgive,&rdquo; she answered gently,  looking at him with tear-dimmed eyes.</p>
<p>She was very pale, and her lips trembled faintly as  she spoke. In her inmost heart she was exulting at the knowledge of his love.  It was as if she had drunk a deep draught of the strong wine of life. In the  rapture of knowing herself beloved she had no room for any other consideration.  His love might be foolish, vain, unprofitable, fatal even. For the moment she  could not measure the consequences, or look into the future. She cared only for  the fact that Bothwell Grahame loved her. That love which she had given to him  in secret, in all maiden modesty, purest, most ethereal sentiment of which  woman&rsquo;s heart is capable, had not been lavished upon a blind and dumb idol,  upon a god of wood and stone.</p>
<p>They walked on for a few minutes in silence, Bothwell  still holding Hilda&rsquo;s hand, but saying never a word. He had said too much  already, since he dared say no more. He had told his secret, and had entreated  to be forgiven. And now he came to a dead stop. Fate had walled him round with  difficulties, had set a barrier before his steps: Fate or his only folly, that  easy yielding to temptation which a man prefers to think of afterwards as  fatality.</p>
<p>The thud of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs upon the grass on the  other side of the hedge startled Bothwell from his reverie, and Hilda from her  beatitude. They looked up, and saw Edward Heathcote cantering towards them on  his powerful black. Mr. Heathcote was renowned for his hunters. He never  counted the cost of a good horse; and he never had been known to buy a bad one.  He was a man who could pick out a horse in a field a quarter of a mile off,  ragged and rough and unshorn, altogether out of condition, long mane and  neglected tail, and could distinguish the quality of the animal to a shade. He  had made many of the hunters he rode, and was not afraid to tackle the most  difficult subject. He loved horses, and they loved him. This was a subject upon  which he and Bothwell sympathised; and it had been a link between them  hitherto. Nothing had been more friendly than their intercourse until the last  few weeks, during which time Mr. Heathcote had carefully avoided Penmorval and  Bothwell Grahame.</p>
<p>He rode through a gap in the hedge, acknowledged  Bothwell&rsquo;s presence with a nod that was barely courteous, and then turned to  his sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better hurry home, Hilda, if you mean to  be in time for dinner,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Bothwell was not slow to take the hint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, Hilda,&rdquo; he said, offering her his hand.</p>
<p>He called her by her Christian name boldly in her  brother&rsquo;s hearing. There was even a touch of defiance in his manner as he shook  hands with her, and lingered with her hand in his, looking at her fondly,  sadly, hopelessly, before he turned and walked slowly away across the bright  newly-cut stubble, which glittered golden in the evening light.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote dismounted and walked beside his  sister, with the black&rsquo;s bridle over his arm, the well-broken horse following  as quietly as a dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and Grahame were in very close confabulation  as I rode up, Hilda,&rdquo; said Heathcote gravely, with scrutinising eyes upon  Hilda&rsquo;s blushing face. &ldquo;Pray what was he saying to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda hung her head, and hesitated before she  replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do not ask me, Edward,&rdquo; she said  falteringly, after that embarrassed silence. &ldquo;I cannot tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot tell me, your brother, and natural  guardian?&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Am I to understand that there is some secret  compact between you and Bothwell Grahame which cannot be told to your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no secret compact. How unkind you are,  Edward!&rdquo; cried Hilda, bursting into tears. &ldquo;There is nothing between us; there  is nothing to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what are you crying about, and why was that  man bending over you, holding your hand just now when I rode up? A man does not  talk in that fashion about nothing. He was making love to you, Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that he loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you call that nothing!&rdquo; said Heathcote  severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It can never come to anything. It was a secret  told unawares, on the impulse of the moment. I have no right to tell you, only  you have wrung the secret from me. Nothing can ever come of it, Edward. Pray  forget that this thing has ever been spoken of between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;He asked  you to marry him, and you refused him. I am very glad of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no reason to be glad,&rdquo; replied Hilda,  with a flash of anger. She was ready to take her lover&rsquo;s part at the slightest  provocation. &ldquo;You have no right to make guesses about Mr. Grahame and me. It is  surely enough for you to know that I shall never be his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had left the stubble-field, and were in a lane  leading to The Spaniards, a lane sunk between high banks and wooded hedgerows,  such as abound in that western world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is enough for me to know,&rdquo; answered Heathcote  gravely, &ldquo;but nothing less than that assurance would be enough. I hope it is  given in good faith?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a severity in his manner which was new to  Hilda. He had been the most indulgent of brothers hitherto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you speak so unkindly about Mr.  Grahame?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What objection have you to make against him, except that  he is not rich?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His want of money would make no difference to me,  Hilda. If it were for your happiness to marry a man of small means, I could  easily reconcile myself to the idea, and would do my best to make things easy  for you. I have a much graver objection against Bothwell Grahame than the fact  that he is without a profession and without income. There is a horrible  suspicion in men&rsquo;s minds about him which makes him a man set apart, like Cain;  and my sister must have no dealings with such a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, Edward?&rdquo; exclaimed Hilda,  turning angrily upon her brother, with indignant eyes. &ldquo;What suspicion? How  dare any one suspect him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappily, circumstances are his worst accusers.  His own lips, his own manner, have given rise to the conviction which has taken  hold of men&rsquo;s minds. When the idea that Bothwell Grahame was the murderer of  that helpless girl first arose in my own mind, I struggled against the hideous  notion. I told myself that I was a madman to imagine such a possibility. But  when I found that the same facts had made exactly the same impression upon  other minds &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>You</em> could think such a thing, Edward!&rdquo; exclaimed Hilda, pale with horror. &ldquo;You, who  have known Bothwell for years, who knew him when he was a boy, you who have  called yourself his friend, seen him day after day! You, a lawyer, a man of the  world! You can harbour such a thought as this! I could not have believed it of  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is because I am a man of the world, and  have seen life on the seamy side, and know too well to what dark gulfs men can  go down when the tempter urges them. Perhaps it is because of my experience  that I suspect Bothwell Grahame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, it is too horrible!&rdquo; cried Hilda passionately.  &ldquo;I feel as if I must be mad myself, or in company with a madman. Bothwell  Grahame &mdash; Bothwell, whom I remember when I was a child, the frank,  generous-hearted lad, who went away to India to fight for his country, and who  fought so well, and won such praise from his commanding officer &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Hilda,&rdquo; interrupted her brother, &ldquo;and who,  just when he seemed on the high road to fortune, threw up his chances, and  abandoned his profession, to become an idler at home. That same Bothwell  Grahame who, when he was asked what he did with himself during a long day at  Plymouth, could give no account of his time. That same Bothwell, whose manner,  from the hour of that catastrophe on the line, became gloomy and sullen &mdash;  altered so completely that he seemed a new man. That same Bothwell, whom  everybody in the neighbourhood of Bodmin suspects of a foul crime. That is the  man whom I do not wish my sister to marry; albeit he is of the same flesh and  blood as the woman whom I respect above all other women upon earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have remembered that &mdash; at last,&rdquo;  said Hilda bitterly. &ldquo;I am glad you have not quite forgotten that this murderer  is Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s first cousin &mdash; brought up with her, taught by the same  teachers, reared in the same way of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant I may see reason to alter my opinion,  Hilda,&rdquo; replied her brother. &ldquo;Do you suppose that this suspicion of mine is not  a source of pain and grief? But while I think as I do, can you wonder that I  forbid any suggestion of a marriage, between my sister and Bothwell Grahame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told you that I shall never be his wife,&rdquo;  said Hilda. &ldquo;Pray do not let us ever speak his name again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the entrance to The Spaniards by this  time &mdash; not the great iron gates by the lodge, but a little wooden gate opening  into the fine old garden, second only in beauty to the Penmorval parterres and  terraces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you mind if I don&rsquo;t appear at dinner,  Edward?&rdquo; asked Hilda presently, as they went into the house. &ldquo;I have a racking  headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl!&rdquo; said her brother tenderly. &ldquo;You  are looking the picture of misery. I am very sorry for you, my dear. I am very  sorry for us all; for I fear there is calamity ahead for some of us. If  Bothwell is wise he will go to the other end of the world, and take himself as  far as possible out of the ken of his countrymen. If he should ask you for  counsel, Hilda, that is the best advice you can give him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he should ask me, that is just the very last  counsel he would ever hear from my lips,&rdquo; answered Hilda indignantly. &ldquo;I would  entreat him to stand his ground &mdash; to live down this vile calumny &mdash; to wait the  day when Providence will clear his name from this dark cloud. Such a day will  come, I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went to her own room, and shut herself up for  the rest of the evening. The convenient excuse of a headache answered very well  with the servants. She declined all refreshment &mdash; would not have this or that  brought up on a tray to oblige Glossop, her own maid, who was deeply concerned  at her young mistress&rsquo;s indisposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a very bad headache,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and all I  want is to be left alone till to-morrow morning. Don&rsquo;t come near me, please,  till you bring me my early cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop sighed and submitted. It was not often that  Miss Heathcote was so wilful. Glossop was the coachman&rsquo;s daughter, had been  born and brought up at The Spaniards, in old Squire Heathcote&rsquo;s time. She was a  buxom young woman of five-and-thirty, and counted herself almost one of the  family.</p>
<p>At last Hilda was alone. She locked her door, and  began to pace her room, up and down, up and down, with her hands clasped upon  her forehead, trying to think out her perplexities.</p>
<p>It was a fine spacious old bedroom, lighted by  old-fashioned casement windows, looking two ways &mdash; one to the garden, one to  that timber-belted lawn which might almost take rank as a park. There was a  sitting-room adjoining, which was Hilda&rsquo;s own particular apartment, containing  her books and piano, and the little table on which she painted china cups and  saucers. Hilda had spent many a happy hour in these rooms, practising,  studying, painting, dreaming over high-art needlework. But this evening she  felt as if she could never again be happy, here or anywhere. A dense cloud of  trouble had spread itself around her, enfolding her as a mantle of darkness,  shutting out all the light of life.</p>
<p>The sun was sinking behind the tall chestnuts, in a  sea of red and gold. Every leaflet of rose or myrtle that framed the casements  showed distinct against that clear evening sky. Such a pretty room within, such  a lovely landscape and sky without; and yet that young soul was full of  darkness.</p>
<p>She had defended her lover with indignant firmness  just now. She had protested his innocence &mdash; declared that this thing could not  be true; and now in solitude she looked in the face of that cruel slander, and  her faith began to waver.</p>
<p>What could be stranger or more suspicious than  Bothwell&rsquo;s conduct this evening? With one breath he had avowed his love; with  the next he had told her that he was unworthy to be her lover &mdash; that they two  could never be man and wife.</p>
<p>Yes, it was true that he had changed of late &mdash; that  he had become gloomy, despondent, fitful. His manner had been that of a man  bowed down by the burden of some secret trouble. But was he for this reason to  be suspected of a horrible crime? It was abominable of people to suspect him &mdash;  most of all cruel and unworthy in her brother, who had known him from boyhood.</p>
<p>And then came the hideous suggestion, as if  whispered in her ear by the fiend himself, &ldquo;What if my brother should be  right?&rdquo; Her own experience of the world was of the slightest. Her chief  knowledge of life was derived from the novels she had read. She had read of  darkest deeds, of strange contradictions in human nature, mysterious workings  of the human heart. Hitherto she had considered these lurid lights, these black  shadows, as the figments of the romancer&rsquo;s fancy. Now she began to ask herself  if they might not find their counterpart in fact.</p>
<p>She had read of gentlemanlike murderers &mdash; assassins  of good bearing and polished manners &mdash; Eugene Aram, Count Fosco, and many more  of the same school. What if Bothwell Grahame were such as these, hiding behind  his frank and easy manner the violent passions of the criminal?</p>
<p>No, she would not believe it. She laughed the foul  fiend to scorn. Her woman&rsquo;s instinct was truer than her brother&rsquo;s legal acumen,  she told herself; and as for those Bodmin busybodies, she weighed their wisdom  as lighter than thistledown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would marry him to-morrow, if he asked me to be  his wife,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;I would stand beside him at the altar, before  the face of all his slanderers. I should be proud to bear his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed crimson at her own boldness, as she  stood before her mirror, with hands clasped, in all the fervour of a vow; but  from that moment her faith in Bothwell Grahame knew no wavering.</p>
<p>In an age when infidelity and scorn of religious  ceremonial is very common among young men, Bothwell Grahame had always been  steadfast to the Church, and to the good old-fashioned habits in which he had  been brought up by his aunt. He was not a zealot, or an enthusiast; but he  attended the services of his church with a fair regularity, and had a proper  respect for the rector of his parish. Even in India, where men are apt to be  less orthodox than at home, Bothwell had always been known as a good Churchman.</p>
<p>For the last year it had been his custom to receive  the sacrament on the first Sunday of the month. He had risen early, and had  walked across the dewy fields to the old parish church, and had knelt among the  people who knew him, and had felt himself all the better for that mystic  office, even when things were going far from well with him. There was much that  was blameworthy in his life; yet he had not felt himself too base a creature to  kneel among his fellow-sinners at the altar of the Sinner&rsquo;s Friend.</p>
<p>It was a shock, therefore, to receive a letter from  the Rector on the last day of August, requesting him to absent himself from the  communion service on the following Sunday, lest his presence before that altar  should be a scandal to the other communicants.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;God forbid that I should condemn any man unheard,&rdquo;  wrote the Rector; &ldquo;but you can hardly be unaware of the terrible scandal  attaching to your name. You have not come to me, as I hoped you would come, to  explain the conduct which has given rise to that scandal. You have taken no  step to set yourself right before your fellow-men. Can you wonder that your own  silence has been in somewise your condemnation? My duty to my flock compels me  to warn you that, until you have taken some steps to free your character from  the shadow that now darkens it, you must not approach the altar of your parish  church.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;If you will come to me, and open your heart to me,  as the sinner should to his priest, I may be able to counsel and to help you.  If you can clear yourself to me, I will be your advocate with your  fellow-parishioners. &mdash; Always your friend,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;JOHN MONKHOUSE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did wisely to write,&rdquo; said Bothwell, crushing  the letter in his clenched fist. &ldquo;If he had spoken such words as those to me, I  believe I should have knocked him down, priest though he is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answered the Rector&rsquo;s letter within an hour  after receiving it.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I have nothing to confess,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;and that is  why I have not gone to your confessional. The difficulties and perplexities of  my life are such as could only be understood by a man of my own age and  surroundings. They would be darker than Sanscrit to clerical gray hairs.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Because I did not choose to answer questions which  I could not answer without betraying the confidence of a friend, my wise  fellow-parishioners have agreed to suspect me of murdering a girl whose face I  never saw till after her death.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I shall attend to receive the sacrament at the  eight-o&rsquo;clock service next Sunday, and I dare you to refuse to administer it. &mdash;  I have the honour to be, yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="note">BOTHWELL GRAHAME.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked to Bodmin and delivered his letter at the  Rectory door. He would not run the risk of an hour&rsquo;s delay. On his way home he  overtook Hilda, near the gates of The Spaniards. She was very pale when they  met, and she grew still paler as they shook hands.</p>
<p>After a word or two of greeting, they walked on  side by side in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder that you can consent to be seen with me,&rdquo;  said Bothwell presently, after a farmer&rsquo;s wife had driven past them on her way  from market. &ldquo;You must have heard by this time what people think about me &mdash;  your brother foremost among them, I believe, for he has given me the cut direct  more than once since the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry that he should be so ready to believe a  lie,&rdquo; said Hilda, &ldquo;for I know that this terrible slander is a lie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for those straight, strong words,  Hilda!&rdquo; exclaimed Bothwell fervently. &ldquo;Yes, it is a lie. I am not a good man. I  have taken one false step in my life, and the consequences of that mistake have  been very heavy upon me. But I am not capable of the kind of wickedness which  my Bodmin friends put down to me. I have not risen to the sublimer heights of  crime. I am not up to throwing a fellow-creature out of a railway-carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not answer that man&rsquo;s questions at the  inquest?&rdquo; asked Hilda urgently, forgetting that she had hardly the right to  demand his confidence. &ldquo;That refusal of yours is the cause of all this misery.  It seems such a foolish, obstinate act on your part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay it does. But I could not do more or less  than I did. To have answered that inquisitive cur&rsquo;s prying questions  categorically would have been to injure a lady. As a man of honour, I was bound  to run all risks rather than do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I begin to understand,&rdquo; said Hilda, blushing  crimson.</p>
<p>Why had she not guessed his secret long before  this? she asked herself. The mystery that surrounded him was the mystery of  some fatal love-affair. She was only a secondary person in his life. There was  another who had been more to him than she, Hilda, could ever be &mdash; another to  whom he was bound, for whom he was willing to sacrifice his own character. She  felt a jealous pang at the mere thought of that unknown one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can never understand,&rdquo; exclaimed Bothwell  passionately. &ldquo;You can never imagine the misery of a man who has bound himself  by a fatal tie which chains him to one woman, long after his heart has gone out  to another. I gave away my liberty while I was in India, Hilda: pledged myself  to one who could give me but little in return for my faith and devotion. I dare  not tell you the circumstances of that bondage &mdash; the fatality which led to that  accursed engagement. I am desperate enough to break the tie, now that it is too  late, now that I dare not offer myself to the girl I love, now that my name is  blasted for ever. Yes, for ever. I know these narrow-minded rustics, and that  to the end of my life I shall in their sight bear the brand of Cain. Here is a  fine example of liberal feeling, Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed her the Rector&rsquo;s letter, crumpled in his  angry grasp.</p>
<p>She read it slowly, tears welling up to her eyes as  she read. How hardly the world was using this poor Bothwell! and the harder he  was used the more she loved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall kneel before the altar of my God, as I  have knelt before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will at least be one communicant there who  will not shrink from you,&rdquo; said Hilda softly. &ldquo;We will kneel side by side, if  you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my darling. God help me to clear my  name from this foul stain which fools have cast upon it; and then a day may  come when you and I may kneel before that altar, side by side, and I may be  thrice blest in winning you for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence before Hilda murmured,  &ldquo;You have told me that you are bound to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and I have told you that I will break through  that bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you do so with honour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It will be more honourable to cancel my vow  than to keep it; and when I am a free man &mdash; when this shadow has been cleared  from my name &mdash; will you take me for your husband, Hilda &mdash; a man with his way to  make in the world, but needing only such an inducement as your love to  undertake the labours of a modern Hercules? Will you have me, Hilda, when I am  my own man again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; answered Hilda softly, yet with a firm  faith that thrilled him. &ldquo;I shall have to brave my brother&rsquo;s anger, perhaps;  but I will not wait till your name is cleared from this slander. Of what use is  fair-weather love? It is in storm and cloud that a woman&rsquo;s faith should be  firmest. When you have freed yourself from that old tie which has grown a  weariness to you, when you can come to me in all truth and honour, my heart  shall answer frankly and fully, Bothwell. And then you can tell all our friends  that we are engaged. It may be a very long engagement, perhaps. I shall not be  of age till two years hence, you know; but that does not matter. People will  know at least that <em>I</em> do not suspect  you of a crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble girl!&rdquo; he cried, beside himself with joy.</p>
<p>Never had he thought to find any woman so frank, so  generous, so brave. He would have caught her in his arms, pressed her to his  passionately beating heart, but she drew herself away from him with a decisive  gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you are free, Bothwell; not until you  can tell me that the old tie is broken. Till then we can be only friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; he answered submissively. &ldquo;Your  friendship is worth more to me than the love of other women. Will you walk to  Penmorval with me? Dora has been wondering at your desertion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day. Please tell Dora that I have not been  very well. I will go to see her to-morrow. Good-bye, Bothwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, my beloved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted at the gate of The Spaniards.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter7"></a>Chapter 7<br>
  A Rapid Conversion</h2>
<p>Three days after that compact between Bothwell and  Hilda, an officious friend went out of his way to inform Mr. Heathcote that his  sister and Mr. Grahame had been seen together several times of late, and that  their manner indicated a more than ordinary degree of intimacy. They had been  observed together at the early service on Sunday morning; they had sat in the  same pew; they had walked away from the church side by side &mdash; indeed, Mr.  Heathcote&rsquo;s friend believed they had actually walked to The Spaniards together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a shame that such a man as Grahame should be  allowed to be on intimate terms with an innocent girl,&rdquo; said the worthy rustic,  in conclusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Badderly, I hope I am able to take care of  my sister without the help of all Bodmin,&rdquo; retorted Heathcote shortly.  &ldquo;Everybody is in great haste to condemn Mr. Grahame; but you must not forget  that my sister and I have been intimate with him and his family for years. We  cannot be expected to turn our backs upon him all at once, because his conduct  happens to appear somewhat mysterious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding which kindly word for Bothwell,  Edward Heathcote went straight home and questioned his sister as to her  dealings with that gentleman.</p>
<p>Hilda admitted that she had seen Mr. Grahame two or  three times within the last week, and that she had allowed him to walk home  with her after the early service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it wise or womanly to advertise your  friendship with a man who is suspected of a most abominable crime?&rdquo; asked her  brother severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it wise and womanly to be true to my  friends in misfortune &mdash; in unmerited misfortune,&rdquo; she answered firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very strong in your faith. And pray what  do you expect will be the end of all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect &mdash; I hope &mdash; that some day I shall be  Bothwell&rsquo;s wife. I shall not be impatient of your control, Edward. I am only  nineteen. I hope during the next two years you will find good reason to change  your opinion about Bothwell, and to give your consent to our marriage&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I do not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you do not, I must take advantage of my  liberty, when I come of age, and marry him without your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have changed your tune, Hilda. A week ago you  told me that you and Bothwell would never be married. Now, you boldly announce  your betrothal to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not betrothed &mdash; yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, there is a preliminary stage, is there? A kind  of purgatory which precedes the heaven of betrothal. Hilda, you are doing a  most ill-advised and unwomanly thing in giving encouragement to this man, in  spite of your brother&rsquo;s warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to be unjust because my brother condemns a friend  unheard? Believe me, Edward, my instinct is wiser than your experience. Why do  you not question Bothwell? He will answer you as frankly as he answered me. He  will tell you his reasons for refusing to satisfy that London lawyer&rsquo;s  curiosity. O Edward, how can you be so cruel as to doubt him, to harden your  heart against him and against me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not against you, my darling,&rdquo; her brother answered  tenderly. &ldquo;If I thought your happiness were really at stake, that your heart  were really engaged, I would do much: but I can but think you are carried away  by a mistaken enthusiasm. You would never have cared for Grahame if the world  had not been against him; if he had not appeared to you as a martyr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong there, Edward,&rdquo; she answered shyly,  her fingers playing nervously with the collar of his coat, the darkly-fringed  eyelids drooping over the lovely gray eyes. &ldquo;I have liked him for a long time.  Last winter we used to hunt together a good deal, you know &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know, or I should have taken care to  prevent it,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, it was always accidental, of course,&rdquo; she  apologised. &ldquo;But in a hunting country, the fast-goers generally get together,  don&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your case there was some very fast-going,  evidently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think then that Bothwell cared for me &mdash;  just a little. And then there came a change. But I know the reason of that  change now; and I know that he really loves me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are monstrous wise, child, and monstrous  self-willed for nineteen years old,&rdquo; said her brother, in those deep grave  tones of his, a voice which gave weight and power to lightest words, &ldquo;and you  would take your own road in life without counting the cost. Well, Hilda, for  your sake I will try to get at the root of this mystery. I will try to fathom  your lover&rsquo;s secret; and God grant I may discover that it is a far less guilty  secret than I have deemed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed Hilda&rsquo;s downcast brow and left her. She  was crying; but her tears were less bitter than they had been, for she felt  that her brother was now on her side; and Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s championship was a  tower of strength.</p>
<p>Once having pledged himself to anything, even  against his own convictions, Heathcote was the last man to go from his word;  but if he needed a stronger inducement than his sister&rsquo;s sorrowful pleading,  that inducement was offered.</p>
<p>He received a note from Dora Wyllard within a few  hours of his conversation with Hilda.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Mr. Heathcote, &mdash; My husband and I have both  been wondering at your desertion of us. For my own part I want much to see you,  and to talk to you upon a very painful subject. Will you call at Penmorval  after your ride to-morrow afternoon, and let me have a few words with you  alone?</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Always faithfully yours,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DOROTHEA WYLLARD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed the little note before he laid it  carefully in a drawer of his writing-table. It was a foolish thing to do, but  the act was quite involuntary and half unconscious. The sight of that  handwriting brought back the feeling of that old time when a letter from Dora  meant so much for him. He had trained himself to think of her as another man&rsquo;s  wife &mdash; to consider himself her friend, and her friend only. He felt himself  bound in honour so to think; all the more because he was admitted to her home,  because she was not afraid to call him friend. Yet there were moments when the  old feeling came over him with irresistible force.</p>
<p>He did not ride that afternoon, but walked across  the fields, and presented himself at Penmorval between four and five o&rsquo;clock.  Mrs. Wyllard was alone in her morning-room, a room in which everything seemed  part of herself &mdash; her favourite books, her piano, her easel &mdash; all the signs of  those pursuits which he remembered as the delight of her girlhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You paint still, I see,&rdquo; he said, glancing at the  easel, on which there was an unfinished picture of a beloved Blenheim spaniel;  &ldquo;you have not forgotten your old taste for animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have so much leisure,&rdquo; she answered somewhat  sadly; and then he remembered her childless home.</p>
<p>She was very pale, and he thought she had a  careworn look, as of one who had spent anxious days and sleepless nights. He  took the chair to which she motioned him, and they sat opposite each other for  some moments in silence, she looking down and playing nervously with a massive  ivory paper-knife which was lying on the table at which she had been writing  when he entered. Suddenly she lifted her eyes to his face &mdash; pathetic eyes which  had looked at him once before in his life with just that appealing look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very cruel of you to believe my cousin  guilty of murder,&rdquo; she said, coming straight to the point. &ldquo;You knew my mother.  Surely you must know our race well enough to know that it does not produce  murderers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you that I believed such a thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your own actions have told me. Bothwell has been  cut by the people about here; and you, who should have been his staunch friend  and champion, you have kept away from Penmorval as if this house were infected,  in order to avoid meeting my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell you a lie, Mrs. Wyllard, even to  spare your feelings,&rdquo; replied Heathcote, deeply moved, &ldquo;and yet I think you  must know that I would do much to save you pain. Yes, I must admit that it has  seemed to me that circumstances pointed to your cousin, as having been directly  or indirectly concerned in that girl&rsquo;s death. His conduct became so strange at  that date &mdash; so difficult to account for upon any other hypothesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your experience of life never made you  acquainted with strange coincidences?&rdquo; asked Dora. &ldquo;Is it impossible, or even  improbable, that Bothwell should have some trouble upon his mind &mdash; a trouble  which arose just about the time of that girl&rsquo;s death? Everything must have a  date; and his anxieties happen to date from that time. I know his frank open  nature, and how heavily any secret would weigh upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe, then, that he has a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes &mdash; there is something &mdash; some entanglement which  prevented his answering Mr. Distin&rsquo;s very impertinent questions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he confided his trouble to you? Has he  convinced you of his innocence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had no occasion to do that. I never believed  him guilty &mdash; I never could believe him guilty of such a diabolical crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tears came into her eyes as she spoke, but she  dried them hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Heathcote, you are a lawyer, a man of the  world, a man of talent and leisure. You have been one of the first to do my  kinsman a cruel wrong. Cannot you do something towards righting him? I am  making this appeal on my own account &mdash; without Bothwell&rsquo;s knowledge. I come to  you as the oldest friend I have &mdash; the one friend outside my own home in whom I  can fully confide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I would give my life in your  service,&rdquo; he answered, with suppressed fervour. He dared not trust himself to  say much. &ldquo;Yes, you have but to command me. I will do all that human  intelligence can do. But this is a difficult case. The only evidence against  your cousin is of so vague a nature that it could not condemn him before a  jury; and yet that evidence is strong enough to brand him as a possible  murderer in the opinion of those who saw him under Distin&rsquo;s examination. He can  never be thoroughly rehabilitated until the mystery of that girl&rsquo;s death has  been fathomed, and I doubt if that will ever be. Where Joseph Distin has  failed, with all the detective-police of London at his command, how can any  amateur investigator hope to succeed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friendship may succeed where mere professional  cleverness has been baffled,&rdquo; argued Dora. &ldquo;I do not think that Mr. Distin&rsquo;s  heart was in this case. At least that is the impression I derived from a few  words which I heard him say to my husband just before he left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Can you recall those words?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nearly. He said he had done his best in the  matter, and should not attempt to go further. And then with his cynical air he  added, &lsquo;Let sleeping dogs lie, Wyllard. That is a good old saying.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think that sounds rather as if he  suspected your kinsman, and feared to bring trouble on your family by any  further investigation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It never struck me in that light,&rdquo; exclaimed Dora,  with a distressed look. &ldquo;Good heavens! is all the world so keen to suspect an  innocent man? If you only knew Bothwell as I know him, you would be the first  to laugh this cruel slander to scorn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your sake I will try and believe in him as  firmly as you do,&rdquo; answered Heathcote, &ldquo;and as Wyllard does, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her countenance fell, and she was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your husband knows of this cloud upon your  cousin&rsquo;s name, I suppose?&rdquo; interrogated Heathcote, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I told him how Bothwell had been treated by  his Bodmin acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he was as indignant as you were, I conclude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said very little,&rdquo; answered Dora, with a pained  expression. &ldquo;My regard for Bothwell is the only subject upon which Julian and I  have ever differed. He has been somewhat harsh in his judgment of my cousin  ever since his return from India. He disapproved of his leaving the army, and  he has been inclined to take a gloomy view of his prospects from the very  first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. He has not a high opinion of Bothwell&rsquo;s  moral character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would hardly say that. But he is inclined to  judge my cousin&rsquo;s errors harshly, and he does not understand his noble  qualities as I do. I should not have been constrained to ask for your help, if  Julian had been as heartily with me in this matter as he has been, in all other  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s bronzed cheek blanched ever so  little at this speech. It moved him deeply to think that in this one anxiety of  her loving heart he could be more to Dora Wyllard than her husband, that she  could turn to him in this trouble, with boundless confidence in his friendship.  What would he not do to merit such confidence, to show himself worthy of such  trust? Already he was prepared to be Bothwell&rsquo;s champion; he was angry with  himself for ever having suspected him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had another motive for appealing to you,&rdquo; continued  Dora shyly. &ldquo;I have reason to think that Bothwell is very fond of Hilda, and  the dearest wish of my life is to see those two united.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wish which is in a fair way of being gratified,&rdquo;  answered Heathcote. &ldquo;My sister announced to me only yesterday that there is  some kind of contingent engagement between her and Mr. Grahame; and that, he  being free to wed her, she means to marry him when she comes of age, with or  without my consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble Hilda!&rdquo; exclaimed Dora; &ldquo;yes, it is just  like her to accept him now when all the world is against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say that it is just like a woman,&rdquo; said Heathcote.  &ldquo;There is a leaven of Quixotism in all your sex, from the Queen to the  wife-beater&rsquo;s victim in Seven Dials. Well, dear Mrs. Wyllard, for your sake and  for Hilda&rsquo;s, I will be Quixotic. I will make it the business of my life to  discover the mystery of that unknown girl&rsquo;s fate. I will pledge myself to think  of nothing else, to undertake no other work or duty until I have exhausted all  possible means of discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for the promise,&rdquo; she answered  fervently. &ldquo;I knew that I had one friend in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sob almost choked her utterance of those last  words. She was deeply wounded by her husband&rsquo;s coldness in this matter of  Bothwell&rsquo;s position. She had expected him to be as indignant as she was, to be  ready to take up arms against all the world for her cousin; and he had been  cold, silent, and gloomy when she tried to discuss the burning question with  him. His manner had implied that he, too, suspected Bothwell, though he would  not go so far as to give utterance to his suspicion.</p>
<p>And now to have won over this strong advocate, this  brave, true-hearted champion, was a relief to her mind that almost overcame her  feelings; here, where she had ever sought to preserve the calm dignity of  manner which became her as Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you with all my heart,&rdquo; she faltered, &ldquo;and  I am sure that my husband will be as rejoiced as I shall, if you can clear  Bothwell&rsquo;s name from this stigma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote rose to take leave. He felt that the  business of his visit was accomplished, that he had no right to linger in Dora  Wyllard&rsquo;s sanctum. It was the first time he had ever been admitted to her own  particular nest, the one room in which she was secure from the possibility of  interruption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell Hilda to come and see me,&rdquo; she said, as they  shook hands. &ldquo;She has deserted me most cruelly of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is better for her not to be here until  her engagement to your cousin is on a more definite footing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, <em>there</em> is the secret in Bothwell&rsquo;s life &mdash; some entanglement which he half admitted to  me the other day. He said that he was bound to one woman while he loved  another. I guessed that Hilda was the one he loved. But who can the other be? I  know of no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some lady whom he met in India, no doubt. The very  air of the East is charged with complications of that kind. If your cousin is a  man of honour, and if we can unriddle the railway mystery, all may yet come  right. Pray do not be too anxious. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so they parted, they two, who once were to have  spent their lives together. Edward Heathcote walked away from Penmorval loving  his old love as dearly as ever he had loved her in his passionate youth. He was  young enough to love with youthful fervour even yet, although he had schooled  himself to believe that youth was past for him. He was only thirty-six; Julian  Wyllard&rsquo;s junior by nearly ten years.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Dora was presiding at afternoon  tea in the yew-tree arbour, where her husband joined her after two hours&rsquo;  business talk with his land-steward. The weather was still warm enough for  drinking tea out of doors, and this yew-tree arbour was Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s  favourite retreat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How pale and tired you are looking, Julian!&rdquo; she  said, scrutinising her husband&rsquo;s face as he sank somewhat wearily into the  comfortable basket-chair she had placed ready for him; &ldquo;you must want some tea  very badly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always enjoy my afternoon cup; and you are the  queen of tea-makers,&rdquo; answered Wyllard; &ldquo;yes, I have had a tiresome talk with  Gretton, who is getting old and prosy, and repeats himself infernally when he  is describing the tenants&rsquo; wants and grievances. He cannot tell me of the  smallest repair required for a barn or pig-sty without repeating every syllable  of his conversation with some garrulous old farmer, and even explaining the  nature of the barn or the sty in dumb-show, &lsquo;as it might be this,&rsquo; and &lsquo;as it  might be that.&rsquo; He maddens me with his &lsquo;as it might be.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are growing nervous, Julian,&rdquo; said  Dora tenderly.</p>
<p>She laid her cool white hand upon his forehead, and  looked concerned at the touch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are actually feverish. You have been irritated  into a fever by that prosy old man. Why do you not superannuate poor old  Gretton, and let Bothwell be your steward? He is much cleverer and more  business-like than you think, and at the worst he would not prose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought Bothwell a fit person to look  after my estate, and I think him less so now,&rdquo; answered her husband coldly. &ldquo;He  is the most unpopular man in Bodmin. Do not let us talk about it any more. By  the way, you have had a visitor this afternoon,&rdquo; he continued, as his wife  handed him his tea. &ldquo;I saw Heathcote go past the library-window while I was at  work with Gretton. What brought him to Penmorval?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him to come,&rdquo; answered Dora, very pale,  but with a steadfast look in her eyes, and about the firmly-moulded lips.</p>
<p>She had never had a secret from her husband in her  life, and although she had made her appeal to Heathcote without his advice or  knowledge, she had no intention of leaving him uninformed now that the thing  was done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked him to come to you &mdash; Edward Heathcote!&rdquo;  exclaimed Wyllard, with a surprised look. &ldquo;And may I know what important  business necessitated this interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to know all about it, Julian,&rdquo;  she answered quietly. &ldquo;I have asked Mr. Heathcote to give me his aid in a  matter in which you have seemed unwilling to help me. You were content that my  cousin should remain under a hideous stigma &mdash; shunned by those who were once  his friends. I am not so content; and I have asked the son of my mother&rsquo;s  oldest and staunchest friend to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she told him, as briefly as possible, what  kind of request she had made to Edward Heathcote, and how he had promised to help  her.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard was livid with anger. He set down  his cup with a hand that trembled like an aspen-leaf; he rose from his chair,  and paced the grassy space in front of the arbour, backwards and forwards half  a dozen times, before he uttered a word. And then, coming back to his wife, he  looked at her with eyes dilated with jealous frenzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why call him the son of your mother&rsquo;s old friend?&rdquo;  he exclaimed. &ldquo;What need of so awkward and ambiguous a phrase? Why not call him  your old lover? It is in that character you have thrown yourself upon him; it  is as your old lover that you try to arouse his chivalry, that you urge him to  do that which your husband&rsquo;s common sense revolted from. A husband is a  reasoning animal, you know. He will only attempt the practical, the possible.  But throw your glove to the lions, and your lover will leap into the arena and  fight for it! And you take advantage of an unquenchable passion, of a  despairing love, to attempt the solution of a problem to which the answer may  be a rope round your cousin&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to insult me as you have done,&rdquo;  said Dora, pale as marble, but calm in her just indignation. &ldquo;You know that I  am your true wife, and that my friendship for Edward Heathcote and his for me  is above suspicion. As for my cousin Bothwell, I know that he has been most  unjustly suspected of a foul crime; and I will not rest till the true history  of that crime has been discovered. Nothing but the discovery of the real  murderer can ever set Bothwell right with his fellow-men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he will have to remain in the wrong,&rdquo;  answered Wyllard savagely. &ldquo;The mystery which Distin&rsquo;s training and experience  failed to fathom will never be brought to light by your knight-errant of The  Spaniards.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter8"></a>Chapter 8<br>
  A Valuable Ally</h2>
<p>Edward Heathcote devoted his every thought to the  task which he had taken upon himself. His first business must be to discover  the name and history of the murdered girl. The clue in his possession was of  the slightest; but he was not without a clue.</p>
<p>First, there was the name and address of the baker  on the biscuit-bag. This gave him an indication of the part of Paris in which  the girl must have been living before she started for England; it also  indicated that she had left Paris within a few days of her journey westward.</p>
<p>But he had a second clue, and a much better one.  Within a week after the adjourned inquest, a farm-labourer had brought him a  large oval silver locket, which he had picked up in the gorge where the girl  fell. The spot lay a little way off the direct path to the man&rsquo;s work, and  morbid curiosity had impelled him to go and examine the place in the early  morning, before his daily labour began.</p>
<p>Prowling about among the ferns and crags, he had  struck his foot against a glistening object, which proved to be an old silver  locket, a good deal worn and battered; a double locket, containing a waxen  Agnus Dei, and a little lace-bordered picture of the Virgin Mary, the paper  worn thin by much handling.</p>
<p>The man carried the locket to the Coroner, who  rewarded him with half a sovereign, and laid the relic aside in his desk, after  a minute examination. It had been attached to a black ribbon, which was worn  and old, and had snapped with the jerk of the girl&rsquo;s fall.</p>
<p>Upon the locket itself there was not the faintest  sign which could lead to the identification of the wearer; but upon the little  lace-edged engraving there were these words neatly written in a fine French  penmanship:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Souvenir from Sister Gudule de la Mis&eacute;ricorde to  L&eacute;onie. Dinan, October 1879. Child of Jesus, pray for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Heathcote&rsquo;s mind this brief legend indicated  three facts.</p>
<p>First, that the Christian name of the wearer of the  locket was L&eacute;onie. Secondly, that she had been educated at a convent at Dinan.  Thirdly, that she left the convent in October 1879, and that the little paper  had been placed in her locket at parting. The nuns have no valuable gifts to  offer their <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</em>. An engraving  of Saint or Blessed Virgin would be the most precious token holy-poverty could  bestow. This indication of the locket was the clue which Heathcote decided to  follow in the first instance. He made his arrangements for leaving England  without an hour&rsquo;s delay; but before turning his back upon The Spaniards, he  exacted Hilda&rsquo;s promise that she would not see Bothwell Grahame during his  absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s entanglement with another woman is  an all-sufficient reason for your holding yourself aloof from him,&rdquo; said her  brother. &ldquo;When he is free to ask you to be his wife, let him come to me and  submit his pretensions to me, as your natural guardian. Perhaps, by that time,  I may have succeeded in setting him right with those who now look askance upon  him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote determined to call upon Joseph Distin  before he crossed the Channel. He had thought the question out thoroughly during  a sleepless night; and it seemed to him that it would be folly to enter upon  his difficult task of investigation without having first armed himself with  such advice as the criminal lawyer was able to give. Before acting upon his own  opinion it would be well to know the opinion of a disinterested expert.</p>
<p>He called at Distin&rsquo;s offices the morning after his  arrival in London. The offices were in Furnival&rsquo;s Inn, a quiet and convenient  spot, not too far from the Old Bailey, and within a ten minutes&rsquo; walk of the  stuffy old law-courts, still extant in Chancery Lane. Mr. Heathcote sent in his  card; and although at least half a dozen clients were waiting for Mr. Distin,  he was admitted immediately, and received with marked cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Heathcote, charmed to see you. How  good of you to look me up!&rdquo; exclaimed Distin, as he pushed forward a  morocco-covered armchair.</p>
<p>There was nothing &aelig;sthetic, picturesque, or  newfangled in Mr. Distin&rsquo;s office, where the prevailing tone was a sober,  substantial comfort. Most of the furniture looked at least fifty years old; but  the Turkey carpet was the richest that the looms of Orient can produce; the  spacious armchairs invited to repose, and to that ease of body which favours  expansion of mind and friendly candour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in town on business or pleasure?&rdquo; inquired  the lawyer, in his airy manner. &ldquo;Going through to the north, perhaps;  grouse-moor, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is further from my thoughts than shooting  grouse,&rdquo; replied Heathcote. &ldquo;I am in London on my way to the Continent. I am  going to hunt up the antecedents of that poor girl who was killed on our line;  I want to find out who she was and how she came to be in the way of meeting her  death in our locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s airy manner was dropped in a moment,  and he became intensely grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are going into that business, are you, and  so late in the day? But why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather not discuss my motive, if you will  kindly excuse me.&rdquo; Mr. Distin bowed. &ldquo;I want to avail myself of your talent and  experience to the uttermost before I begin to work on my own account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most my talent can do for you in this matter  is very little; to tell you the truth, I made a dismal failure of the  business,&rdquo; returned Distin, with agreeable frankness. He was too successful a  man to be ashamed to confess a failure. &ldquo;But really now, Mr. Heathcote, by far  the wisest counsel I can give you is to forget all about this sad story, and to  let the world go on just as if that poor girl&rsquo;s death had never come within  your ken. You did your duty as Coroner, you know. Nothing more could be asked  or expected of you. Why, then, should you do more? You are very friendly with  the family at Penmorval. Take my advice. &lsquo;Let sleeping dogs lie.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what you said to Mr. Wyllard the morning  you were leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may have used that adage. It is a very good  one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you recommend me to drop this investigation,  for the sake of my friends at Penmorval,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;I infer from that  advice that you suspect Mr. Grahame of being concerned in the French girl&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess to you that his whole manner and conduct  were to my mind suggestive of guilt. Of course, manner and conduct are not  evidence. At this present time there is not a shred of evidence to connect Mr.  Grahame with the crime, except the one fact that he was in the train when the  girl was killed; but that point would apply equally to everybody else in the  train, or rather to any one who happened to be alone in a carriage as Mr.  Grahame was. At present Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s cousin is safe. If his was the arm that  thrust that girl off the footboard, there is nothing to bring the crime home to  him. But go a few steps further, follow up any clue which you may happen to  possess &mdash; you would not start upon such an investigation without some kind of  clue,&rdquo; speculated Joseph Distin shrewdly&mdash; &ldquo;pursue your trail a few yards  further, and you may come upon evidence that will put a rope round your  friend&rsquo;s neck, and bring lasting disgrace upon the family at Penmorval. I  advised my old friend Wyllard to let this matter drop. I advise you to do the  same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot act upon your advice. There has been too  much mischief done already. Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s refusal to answer your questions  about his whereabouts on the day of the murder has condemned him in the minds  of his fellow-townsmen. His name is blackened by a terrible suspicion, and I  have sworn to clear it, if it can be cleared. If he is guilty &mdash; well, he can  hardly be worse off with a rope round his neck than he is now, with all his old  friends estranged from him. For my own part, in such a case I should infinitely  prefer the rope. It would be a short way out of a difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My experience of criminals is that when the crisis  comes they would rather endure the ignominy than the halter,&rdquo; replied Distin.  &ldquo;Perhaps you have never seen a man within an hour of his being hanged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God I have not been obliged to do that,  though I have had to look upon one an hour after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you do not know to what manhood can  descend &mdash; how it can grovel before the spectre of instant, certain death. Come  now, cannot I persuade you to think better of your idea of investigating this  mysterious business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I have promised to do it. I must keep my  promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So be it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Joseph Distin discussed the matter freely,  with perfect frankness. He told Heathcote what means he had used to discover  the girl&rsquo;s identity on this side of the Channel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have gone further and crossed the water,  if I had not seen good reason to desist,&rdquo; he said, when he had explained his  plan of inquiry at every likely lodging-house, and how that plan had totally  failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what would you have done on the other side of  the water, without any clue?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have gone across myself and put the case  into the hands of F&eacute;lix Drubarde, one of the cleverest police-officers in  Paris. He would have been instantly on the alert to hear of any application  made to the police by the relatives and friends of the missing girl. She could  hardly disappear for any length of time without some one being concerned by her  disappearance. The application to the police might not occur perhaps until  months after her death; but it would be likely to occur sooner or later. And,  again, F&eacute;lix Drubarde has his allies in every quarter of Paris. He hears of  events so quickly that it might be supposed he had a network of speaking-tubes  all over the city. With his help I should have been almost certain to arrive at  the identification of the dead girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I sent three advertisements to each of the  best known Paris newspapers,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;How do you account for those  advertisements not having been seen by the girl&rsquo;s friends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because French people of the lower classes are  sometimes very illiterate, and live in a very narrow circle. Your papers may  not have come within the range of the girl&rsquo;s friends. They would be likely to  apply to the police when time passed and they received no tidings of her. But  they would not be likely to see your best known papers &mdash; the papers of the  upper classes, no doubt. And then your advertisements appeared immediately  after the girl&rsquo;s death; at a time when the parents or friends had no reason for  feeling alarmed as to her safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be so,&rdquo; replied Heathcote thoughtfully.  &ldquo;I think you can help me very much in my undertaking, Mr. Distin, if you are  willing to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a letter of introduction to this Parisian  detective, and let me engage his aid by and by, when I go to Paris. I shall be  happy to pay him liberally for his services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drubarde is no extortioner. He will not fleece you,&rdquo;  said Distin. &ldquo;In fact the man is a gentleman, in his own particular line. He  has made an independence, and he only works now as an amateur. Yes, I will give  you a letter of introduction to him with pleasure, since you are bent on  pursuing this business to the bitter end. I suppose you will go straight to  Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I want first to follow up the only valuable  clue I have. I shall go first to Dinan, in Brittany, to find the convent, where  I have reason to believe this poor girl was educated.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter9"></a>Chapter 9<br>
  Fever Dreams</h2>
<p>Edward Heathcote left Waterloo Station for  Southampton within an hour of leaving Mr. Distin&rsquo;s office, dined hastily at the  Dolphin Hotel, and started for St. Malo in the South-Western steamer at seven  o&rsquo;clock in the evening. It was still early on the following morning when he  landed on the long stone quay at St. Malo, and the picturesque old granite  walls were still flushed with the rosy light of a newly-risen sun. The quaint  island-citadel, with its exquisite bay and golden sands, had been familiar to  Edward Heathcote in the past. He had lingered here to rest after a long ramble  in Brittany, and he had an affection for the steep narrow streets and quaint  old houses, with their all-pervading aspect of the seventeenth century, the  days of Bourbons and Cond&eacute;s, kings and warriors, princely priests and priestly  politicians.</p>
<p>Much as he loved the old-world town, Heathcote had  no intention of loitering there on this September morning, lovely as the bay  and the rocks and the smiling colony of white-walled villas yonder at Param&eacute;  looked in the early sunlight. He only waited to get his portmanteau through the  Custom House in order to carry it to the little office attached to the Dinan  steamer, where he ascertained the hour for the boat&rsquo;s departure.</p>
<p>Chance and tide favoured him. The steamer was to  leave at eleven o&rsquo;clock. This afforded time for a leisurely breakfast at the  Franklin, and would enable him to reach Dinan early in the afternoon. He  breakfasted briefly and temperately, as became a man whose mind was full of  anxious thought, and then went for a stroll in the old streets, and looked in  at the Cathedral.</p>
<p>He had reflected seriously upon his interview with  the criminal lawyer. The fact that he had found his own original opinion about  Bothwell Grahame shared by this man, so deeply versed in the ways of criminals,  in the science of circumstantial evidence, was to the last degree startling and  disconcerting. He felt that he was setting out upon a task which he could but  perform in a half-hearted manner, struggle as he might against that first  conviction of his. He had undertaken this task for Hilda&rsquo;s sake, for Dora&rsquo;s  sake. What misery must result if Joseph Distin were right after all, and in an  ill-judged attempt to gratify these two trusting women he should bring about  the discovery of Bothwell&rsquo;s guilt! That guilt was at present but a dark  suspicion which men hardly dared hint to each other; but if Distin&rsquo;s judgment  was correct, any unlucky discovery might make the suspicion a fact.</p>
<p>But he had promised, and the pledge must be kept.  He must follow up the clue which he held till it led him to other links in the  chain of the victim&rsquo;s history; and the chances were that in the victim&rsquo;s  history he would find a clue to the murderer&rsquo;s identity.</p>
<p>It was a lovely autumnal noontide, and the gay  little town of Dinard, with its gardens rising stage above stage on the slope  of the hill, its queer little bays and recesses of golden sand, was smiling in  sunlight as the &ldquo;Isle et Rance&rdquo; steamed across the broad bay of St. Malo to the  mouth of the Rance. There are few prettier rivers than this little Rhine of  Brittany, and Edward Heathcote had loved it well in days gone by. But to-day he  sat upon the bridge smoking his cigar, and gazing at the green hills and  hanging woods, the villas and villages, and craggy cliffs and ever-varying  shore, without seeing the objects upon which his eyes seemed to rest. The  nearer he came to the task of investigation, the more irksome became his duty.  His heart failed him as he took out the silver locket, and read the name upon  the paper inside. It was the name of the woman who was to enlighten him about  the dead girl, who was perhaps to put in his hand the clue which would lead him  straight to the murderer.</p>
<p>And yet who could say that he would find Sister  Gudule de la Mis&eacute;ricorde at Dinan? He did not even know the name of the convent  in which she lived. She might be dead. And yet the date of the inscription was  but two years old. There was every chance that the Sister still lived: and he  must be dull if he failed to find her.</p>
<p>He stopped at the first church to which he came  after leaving the boat &mdash; an old church in the lower part of the town. Here he  asked his way to the presbytery, and called upon the priest, who told him that  there was only one educational convent in Dinan, the Convent of St. Elizabeth  of Hungary, an Ursuline convent situated in a quiet quarter of the town.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote left his portmanteau at one of the  hotels in the market-place, and drove at once to the convent. It was a large  white building, with plastered walls, far from beautiful in itself, and showing  every sign of poverty; but the gardens were neatly kept, the rooms were  exquisitely clean, and the clumsy old Breton furniture was polished to the  highest degree.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote was received in the convent parlour  by the Reverend Mother, a homely little tub-shaped personage, in a black serge  habit and a picturesque white cap, which concealed every vestige of hair upon  her broad intelligent forehead. She had kindly black eyes, and a frank  benevolent smile, and Heathcote felt at once at his ease with her. She looked a  little disappointed when, in answer to her preliminary question, he told her  that he had not come to offer a new pupil. The pupils were the chief source of  revenue for the convent, albeit the <em>pension</em> was of the smallest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen that locket before, madame?&rdquo; he  asked, laying the silver medallion before the Reverend Mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen many such,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;The Holy  Father allows us to dispose of them for the benefit of the convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a little paper inside with some writing.  Will you look at it, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened the locket and unfolded the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, this is Sister Gudule&rsquo;s writing. I know it  very well indeed,&rdquo; said the nun, looking at her visitor with a puzzled air, as  if wondering whether the gentleman had not gone a little astray, his real  destination being the great monastic madhouse yonder on the crest of a wooded  hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Gudule is still living &mdash; still with you,  perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; interrogatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you remember L&eacute;onie, to whom that little  picture was given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother smiled her modest smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie is not an uncommon name,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;We  have had many pupils so called from time to time. Our school numbers over a  hundred and fifty pupils, you must remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recall any pupil of that name who left you  two years ago?&rdquo; asked Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have from thirty to forty pupils leaving us  every year. Will you permit me to ask the object of your inquiry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very serious one, or I should be desolated  to give you so much trouble,&rdquo; answered Heathcote courteously, in that polite  language which he spoke almost as fluently as his native English. &ldquo;The poor  girl to whom that locket belonged met her death in my neighbourhood less than  two months ago. She fell from a railway-carriage as the train was crossing a  viaduct. Whether that death was accidental or the result of a crime remains as  yet unknown. But there are those in my country to whom it is vital that the  whole truth should be known. If you can help me to discover the truth, you will  be helping the cause of justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sister Gudule will remember,&rdquo; said the Reverend  Mother, ringing a hell. &ldquo;She is one of our lay-sisters, a great favourite with  all the children. She nurses them when they are ill, and takes care of them  when they go out for a holiday, and plays with them as if she were a child  herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A lay-sister, the portress, answered the bell, and  went in quest of Sister Gudule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a very unprepossessing appearance,&rdquo; said  the Reverend Mother. &ldquo;I fear you may be a little shocked at first seeing her,  but she is so amiable that we all adore her. She has been the victim of  misfortune from her cradle. Her deformity is the consequence of a nurse&rsquo;s  carelessness. It turned the heart of her mother against her, and she was a  neglected and unloved child. Her family was noble, but the husband speculated  in railways, and the wife was silly and extravagant. By the time Gudule was a  young woman poverty had overtaken her father, and he was only too glad to  acquiesce in the girl&rsquo;s resolution to enter a convent. She came to us penniless  thirty years ago, and has worked for her bread ever since. I do not think I  exaggerate when I say that she is the most valuable member of our community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was opened softly and Sister Gudule  appeared. This little preface from the Reverend Mother had not been unnecessary  to lessen the shock of her personal appearance, which was startling in its  unqualified ugliness.</p>
<p>Sister Gudule de la Mis&eacute;ricorde was the very type  of the wicked fairy in the dear old child stories. She was short and squat,  with broad shoulders and a decided hump. She had a nose like a potato, and a  lower lip like that of the lady who moistened the spinster&rsquo;s yarn; she had an  undeniable moustache and beard; yet in spite of all, there was something  pleasant, conciliating, reassuring in her face. The low broad forehead  suggested intellectual power; there was a humorous twinkle in the small gray  eyes, as of one who could revel in a joke; the thick under-lip and prominent  under-jaw were the indications of a boundless benevolence.</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother handed the locket and its  enclosure to Sister Gudule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell you that the Sister has a most  miraculous memory,&rdquo; she said confidentially to Heathcote. &ldquo;I have never known  her forget the most trivial event in the history of our lives. She is our  unwritten calendar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s locket,&rdquo; said Sister  Gudule. &ldquo;How comes it here? Is my little L&eacute;onie in Dinan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie Lemarque!&rdquo;</p>
<p>How glibly she pronounced the name; and how strange  it seemed to Edward Heathcote to hear it! Like a name out of a tomb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The owner of that locket is dead,&rdquo; he answered  gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! L&eacute;onie Lemarque! Dead at twenty years old!  Dead! Why, there was not a healthier child in the convent, after we had once  built up her constitution. She was in a sad way when she came to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie Lemarque!&rdquo; repeated the Reverend Mother. &ldquo;I  never thought of her when Monsieur showed me the locket. L&eacute;onie Lemarque! Yes,  she left us in 1879 to go to her old grandmother in Paris. And now she has met  with a violent death in England. Monsieur will tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur repeated his story, this time with further  details, for Sister Gudule questioned him closely. She would have every particular.  The tears streamed down her cheeks, hung upon her bristly moustache. She was  deeply distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know how I loved that child,&rdquo; she said,  excusing herself to the Superior; and then to Heathcote, &ldquo;Ah, Monsieur, you  could never understand how I loved her. I saved her life. From the weakest  frailest creature, I made her a sound and healthy child. Indeed, I may say that  I did much more than this. With the help of God and the intercession of His  Saints I saved her mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; said the Reverend Mother. &ldquo;The  child came to us under most peculiar circumstances. Sister Gudule took entire  charge of her for the first year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she rewarded me tenfold for my trouble,&rdquo; added  Gudule; &ldquo;she gave me love for love, measure for measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you tell me all about her &mdash; every detail? The  knowledge may help me to avenge her death,&rdquo; said Heathcote eagerly. &ldquo;It is my  belief, and the belief of others, that she was foully murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was intensely agitated. He felt as if he had  taken into his hand the lever which worked some formidable machine &mdash; an  instrument of death and doom, and that every movement of his hand might bring  destruction. Yet the process once begun must go on. He was no longer an  individual, working of his own free will; he was only an agent in the hands of  Fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, we will tell you all we can,&rdquo; said the  Reverend Mother. &ldquo;But you must allow us to offer you a little coffee. You have  travelled, and you look white and weary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convent was proud of its coffee, almost the  only refreshment ever offered to visitors. The portress brought a little oval  tray covered with a snow-white napkin, a little brown crockery pot, a white cup  and saucer, all of the humblest, but spotlessly clean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie was with us eight years,&rdquo; said the Reverend  Mother, while Sister Gudule dried her eyes and tried to regain her composure.  &ldquo;She was just ten years old when she was brought to us by her grandmother, a  person who had been at one time a dressmaker in one of the most fashionable  quarters of Paris, but who had fallen upon evil days, and lived in a very  humble way in a small lodging on the left bank of the Seine. L&eacute;onie was an  orphan, the daughter of Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s only son, who had died young,  broken-hearted at the death of his young wife. The child was brought to us by a  priest, who came all the way from Paris with his little charge. She had but  just recovered from a long illness, which was said to be brain-fever, caused by  a very terrible mental shock which she had endured two months before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you told the nature of that shock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; the priest did not offer any information upon  that point, and I did not presume to question him. He assured me that the case  was one which merited the most benevolent consideration. Madame Lemarque had no  means of educating the child herself, nor could she afford the pension demanded  by a Parisian convent. The cur&eacute; thought that our fine air would do much to  restore the child to health and strength, and he knew that our system of  education was calculated to develop her mind and character in the right  direction. He guaranteed the regular payment of the child&rsquo;s pension, and we  never had occasion to apply for it a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Madame Lemarque ever come to see her  granddaughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. L&eacute;onie remained with us from year&rsquo;s end to  year&rsquo;s end till after her eighteenth birthday, when, at Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s  desire, we made arrangements for her travelling to Paris with other pupils who  were returning to the great city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you never saw Madame Lemarque?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor ever heard from her directly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, we had letters &mdash; very nicely-written  letters &mdash; full of gratitude for what Madame Lemarque was pleased to call our  kindness to L&eacute;onie. The child used to write to her grandmother monthly, while  she was with us, and her letters were the best evidence that she was fairly  used and happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was a sweet child,&rdquo; said Gudule, &ldquo;and deserved  every indulgence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she ever tell you anything about the shock  which caused her illness?&rdquo; asked Heathcote of the lay-sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In her right senses never one syllable,&rdquo; answered  Gudule. &ldquo;I would not have questioned her upon that subject for worlds, for I  believed that she had narrowly escaped madness. But during the six months in  which I nursed her &mdash; for her health was completely broken, and it required all  that time to build up her strength and calm her nerves &mdash; she used to sleep in a  little bed close to mine, and in her troubled dreams I used to hear very  strange things. How far the dreams were inspired by the recollections of real  events, I cannot venture to say; but there were phrases that recurred so often  &mdash; a horrible vision which so continually repeated itself, like a scene in a  play &mdash; that I can but suppose it to have been the representation of some event  which had really happened before the child&rsquo;s waking eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you recall the nature of that vision?&rdquo;  inquired Heathcote breathlessly.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that he was on the threshold of a  new mystery &mdash; as terrible as the old one, and even darker: a tragedy hidden in  the past, reflected only in a child&rsquo;s fever-dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should ask me if I can forget it, Monsieur,&rdquo;  said Sister Gudule. &ldquo;I wish with all my heart that I could. I have prayed many  a prayer for oblivion. The poor child used to be feverish every night &mdash; a low  fever, which only came on in the evening, but some nights were worse than  others &mdash; and in her most feverish nights this dream seemed almost inevitable. I  used to lie awake expecting it, dreading it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She used to talk in her sleep, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To talk, yes; and to scream &mdash; a terrible shriek  sometimes, which would disturb every sleeper in the great dormitory adjoining  my little room. She would start up on her pillow, and stare straight before her  with wide-open eyes, being fast asleep all the time, you understand. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill  her, don&rsquo;t kill her!&rsquo; she would cry; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t shoot her!&rsquo; And then she would rock  herself backwards and forwards, and moan in a low voice, &lsquo;The forest &mdash; the  dark, dark forest; she is there, always there, with the blood running down her  dress! Take her away, take away the dark forest &mdash; take away the blood!&rsquo; Her  words varied sometimes, but those words never: &lsquo;Take away the dark forest &mdash;  take away the blood!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And did she never tell you what the dream meant &mdash;  you, her nurse and comforter, with whom she must have been on such confidential  terms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear child. She loved me and trusted me with  all the strength of her innocent heart, I believe; but she never told me the  cause of that awful dream. And I never dared to question her. I was only  anxious that she should forget the past &mdash; that if her nights were fevered and  restless, her days should be peaceful and bright. I did everything I could to  amuse and interest her, in studies, needlework, and play, and to help her to  forget the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you succeeded, Sister,&rdquo; said the head of the  convent approvingly. &ldquo;I never saw a more wonderful cure. From a nervous  hysterical child L&eacute;onie Lemarque grew into a bright merry girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, with God&rsquo;s help she was cured; but the cure  was very slow. The shock which shattered her health, and for a time impaired  her mind, must have been an awful one. Never before had I seen gray hairs upon  the head of a child, but the thickly curling hair upon L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s temples when  she came to us was patched with white; and it was years before the hair resumed  its natural colour. For the first year her memory was almost a blank. It would  have been useless for any one to attempt to teach her in class with the other  children. She would have been despised as an idiot, laughed at perhaps, and her  heart broken. I obtained the Reverend Mother&rsquo;s permission to keep her in my  room, and to teach her in my own way, and little by little I awakened her  memory and her mind. Both had been, as it were, benumbed, frozen, paralysed, by  that awful shock of which we know so little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you would guess that she had witnessed some  dreadful scene, perhaps the death of some one she loved,&rdquo; speculated Heathcote.  &ldquo;Did she never talk to you of her childhood in Paris, her relatives?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rarely of any one except her grandmother,&rdquo;  answered Sister Gudule, &ldquo;and of her she told me very little. Whether her  illness had blotted out the memory of her childhood, or whether she shrank from  any allusion to the past, I cannot tell. One day I asked her who had given her  a blue satin neckerchief which I found in her trunk &mdash; a costly neckerchief, and  much too fine for a child to wear. She told me that it was a New Year&rsquo;s gift  from her aunt, but at the mention of the name she turned deadly pale, her eyes  filled with tears, and her whole body shook like an aspen-leaf. I changed the  conversation that moment, and I never again heard her speak of her aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would infer from her agitation that the aunt  was connected with the tragedy of the child&rsquo;s life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was perhaps the person whom she saw assailed when  she cried out, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t kill her; don&rsquo;t shoot her!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought that it must have been so. That  dreadful cry of hers, &lsquo;Take away the blood! take away the dark forest!&rsquo; No one  who did not hear those cries of hers, no one who did not see the awful  expression of her eyes, staring, dilated, full of horror; no one who had not  seen and heard her as I did could ever understand how dreadful, how real that  vision was to me as well as to the sleeper. I used to feel as if I had seen  murder done, and had stood by without the power to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a word, you felt, by pure sympathy, almost  exactly what the child felt,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>Already he had begun to adore Sister Gudule, just  as the children of the convent adored her. He forgot her hump, he forgave her  the potato-shaped nose, he accepted her beard as a detail that gave piquancy to  her countenance. He was subdued, subjugated by that intensely sympathetic  nature which revealed itself in every word and look of the lay-sister.</p>
<p>But he had a task to perform, and it was necessary  that he should proceed with his inquiries in a business-like manner. He had  already taken certain notes in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie Lemarque left you in 1879, and she had been  with you eight years,&rdquo; he said, with pencil in hand. &ldquo;She must have come to you  in 1871.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it was in 1871, not long after the troubles  in Paris. It was early in November she was brought to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were told that she had been ill two months  in consequence of a mental shock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then one may fairly conclude that the event which  caused her illness occurred early in the September of 1871.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. I thank you most heartily, Madame,&rdquo; with a  courteous bow to the Reverend Mother, &ldquo;for the help you and Sister Gudule have  so graciously bestowed upon me. But I would venture to ask one more favour,  namely, that you would honour me with a line by way of introduction to the  worthy priest who brought L&eacute;onie Lemarque from Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Monsieur, that is impossible! Father Sorbier  died three years ago, just a year before L&eacute;onie left us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is unfortunate. He doubtless knew the mystery  of the girl&rsquo;s childhood, and perhaps might have helped me to unravel the secret  of her strange death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really believe that the two events have any  bearing upon each other, Monsieur?&rdquo; demanded Sister Gudule thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not, Madame,&rdquo; replied Heathcote; &ldquo;but it is  only by working backwards that I can hope to arrive at any clue to the mystery  which has puzzled us all in Cornwall. That poor girl must have had some purpose  in going to England, in travelling to so remote a neighbourhood as ours. Even  if her death were an accident, or an unpremeditated crime, her presence in that  place cannot have been accidental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote asked to see the class-rooms and the  chapel before he left the convent, a request which was graciously accepted, as  a compliment to the Reverend Mother. He was paraded along wide and airy  passages, was shown an empty refectory, where plates and mugs and huge piles of  bread and butter were arranged on long deal tables, covered with snow-white  linen, in readiness for the afternoon <em>go&ucirc;ter</em>.  He saw the chapel with its humble decorations, its somewhat crude copy of a  well-known Guido, its altar, rich in gilded paper, home-made lace, and cheap  china vases. All here spoke of small means; but the flowers on the altar were  freshly gathered, and the neatness and cleanliness of all things in chapel and  convent charmed the stranger&rsquo;s eye. He slipped a couple of sovereigns into the box  by the door, praised the airy corridors, the spacious whitewashed rooms, and  left the principal and the lay-sister alike charmed with his good French and  his friendly manners.</p>
<p>The clock of the monastery on the opposite hill was  striking five as he drove away from the convent, a silvery chime that could be  heard all over Dinan.</p>
<p>He dined at the <em>table  d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</em> at the H&ocirc;tel de la Poste, and walked on the terrace on the town  walls after dinner. There is no fairer view in Brittany than the panorama of  wooded hills from that walk above the town walls. The cool night air, the  silvery moonlight, soothed Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s nerves. He was able to meditate  upon his afternoon&rsquo;s work, to think over the story he had heard from Sister  Gudule, and to speculate upon the chances of his being able to follow up this  thread of a life-history until it led him to some point which would throw a  light upon the mystery of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon Sister Gudule&rsquo;s story, he could but  conclude that the child L&eacute;onie had been the witness of some scene of violence  in which a woman had been the victim &mdash; a murder possibly, or it might be only  an attempted murder. Blood had been spilt. Hence that awful cry, &ldquo;Take away the  blood, take away the dark forest!&rdquo; &mdash; a child&rsquo;s appeal to some unknown power to  remove an object of terror.</p>
<p>One and one only clue had he obtained from Sister  Gudule as to the person of the victim, and even that indication might be a  false light leading him astray.</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s painful emotion at the utterance of her  aunt&rsquo;s name suggested that the victim had been that aunt. The mere mention of  the name would conjure up all the horror of that scene which had so nearly  wrecked the child&rsquo;s reason.</p>
<p>It therefore seemed plain to Heathcote&rsquo;s mind that  a murder, or an attempt at murder, had been committed in a dark wood, and that  the victim had been L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s aunt. So deeply interested was he in this  mystery of ten years back, so powerfully moved by this strange story of a  child&rsquo;s suffering, that he almost forgot that the business which had brought  him across the Channel was to find out the true story of the French girl&rsquo;s  death, and not to unravel the mystery of this old and perhaps forgotten crime  in the unknown wood. So interested was he that he resolved at any cost of  trouble to himself to discover the details of the scene reproduced so often in  the child&rsquo;s fevered dreams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows whether that may not be the surest way  of arriving at the truth about the girl&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; he argued with himself. &ldquo;At  any rate it is the only way that offers itself at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked late upon the walls of Dinan, enjoying  the quiet of the moonlit scene, hearing the bells chime again and again,  silver-clear across the vale, from the monastery where the madmen were dreaming  their disjointed dreams, or wandering sane and healed in the spirit-land of the  past, amid the faces of friends long dead. He walked late, thinking of a face  that had looked at him with trusting eyes in the moment of parting, lovely eyes  whose every expression he knew, but most of all that tender pathetic look which  had once tried to soothe the agony of loss.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To serve her and work for her, surely that is  enough for a man&rsquo;s bliss,&rdquo; he thought, with a sad, half-satirical smile. &ldquo;In  the good old days of chivalry her knight would have deemed it happiness to  bleed and perish for her sake far away in Palestine &mdash; glory and honour enough  to have worn her colours in his helmet. Are we a meaner race, we men of the  present, that we cannot love without hope of reward? Well, I have pledged  myself to my crusade. I have put on my lady&rsquo;s colours, and I will work for her  as faithfully as if my love were not hopeless. I will prove to her that there  is some chivalry still left in this degenerate world, under the modern guise of  disinterested friendship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He started for Paris by the first train next  morning, a fourteen hours&rsquo; journey, a journey of dust and weariness, though the  road lay through a fair country, with glimpses of the blue sea, and then by the  widening river, till the tall houses and the many church-towers of the great  city glimmered whitely before him, under the September moon. He put up at his  old resting-place, the H&ocirc;tel de Bade, amidst the roar and hustle of the  Boulevard; and he set out the next morning after an early breakfast in quest of  Monsieur Drubarde&rsquo;s apartment, which was situated in that older and shabbier  Paris of the left bank.</p>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde&rsquo;s apartment was on the Quai des  Grands Augustins, <em>au cinqui&egrave;me</em>, a  rather alarming indication to infirm or elderly legs, but which did not appal  Edward Heathcote. He ran up the five flights of a dark wooden staircase, and  found himself upon an airy landing, lighted and ventilated by a skylight.</p>
<p>The skylight was half open, and through it  Heathcote saw flowers and greenery upon the roof. He also caught the odour of a  very respectable cigar, which the soft west wind blew towards him through the  same opening.</p>
<p>On a door opposite the top of the steep fifth  flight appeared a brass plate, with the name, F&eacute;lix Drubarde.</p>
<p>Heathcote rang, and his summons was answered almost  instantly from an unexpected direction.</p>
<p>A large, round, rubicund face peered through the  skylight, and a voice asked if Monsieur desired an interview with F&eacute;lix  Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come here in that hope, Monsieur,&rdquo; answered  Heathcote, &ldquo;and I venture to infer that I have the honour of addressing  Monsieur Drubarde.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am that individual, Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the  rubicund gentleman, opening the skylight to its widest extent. &ldquo;Would it be too  much to ask you to ascend to my summer <em>salon</em> upon the leads? It is pleasanter even for a business interview than the  confinement of four walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a steep straight ladder against the wall  immediately under the skylight. Heathcote mounted this and emerged upon the  roof, face to face with F&eacute;lix Drubarde.</p>
<p>The retired police-officer&rsquo;s appearance was  essentially rustic. His attire resembled the holiday costume of the <em>station de bains</em> rather than the normal  garb of a great busy metropolis. He was clothed from head to foot in white  linen; his garments were all of the loosest, and he wore a pair of ancient buff  slippers, which had doubtless trodden the bitter biting foam on the beach of  Dieppe or the sands of Trouville. Altogether, Monsieur Drubarde looked the very  picture of comfort and coolness on this warm September morning. He had made for  himself a garden upon an open space of flat leaded roof, which was belted round  with ancient chimney-stacks of all shapes and sizes, just as a lawn is girdled  with good old oaks and beeches. On one side of his garden he had rigged up a  light lattice-work from chimney to chimney, and his nasturtiums and Virginia  creepers had clothed the lattice with green and gold. This he called his <em>all&eacute;e verte</em>, and he declared that it  reminded him of Fontainebleau in the days of the famous Diana.</p>
<p>His garden was gorgeous with geraniums and roses,  and perfumed with mignonette and honeysuckle. He had his morning coffee on a  little iron table; he had a wicker-work easy-chair for himself, and another for  a friend; and a smart rug, of the usual gaudy pattern to be seen in French  lodging-houses, was spread under his slippered feet. He had his cigars and his  newspaper, and, above all, he had a large and ancient black poodle of uncanny  appearance, which looked as if he were the very dog under whose semblance the  arch-fiend visited Dr. Faustus.</p>
<p>Before seating himself in the basket-chair which  Monsieur Drubarde offered him, Heathcote took Joseph Distin&rsquo;s letter out of his  pocket-book, and handed it to the ex-police-officer, who became convulsive with  rapture when he saw the signature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur was welcome on his own account as a  doubtless distinguished Englishman; as the friend of Monsieur Distin he is more  than welcome. His visit is an honour, a privilege which an old member of the  Paris police cannot too highly value,&rdquo; said Drubarde, with enthusiasm. &ldquo;Ah,  Monsieur, what a man is that Joseph Distin! what a commanding genius! I have  had the honour to assist him in cases where that mighty intellect revealed  itself with startling force, and where, I am proud to say, he must inevitably  have failed, but for my humble assistance. Yes, Monsieur, old Drubarde has a <em>flair</em>, which even your great English  lawyer envies. What a man, all the same!&rdquo; Monsieur Drubarde paused for breath,  and also to offer Mr. Heathcote a cigar, which was frankly accepted. And then  the police-officer continued his eulogy of the English lawyer, with which he  contrived to interweave a little gentle egotism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he been a Frenchman and lived under the first  Emperor, he would have been greater than the Duke of Otranto, whom my father  had the privilege to serve, and whom I remember seeing when I was a child. My  father took me into the great chief&rsquo;s office one day, a little toddling  creature, chubby, and, I am told, beautiful, in my little uniform of the Old  Guard, a mother&rsquo;s fond fancy, Monsieur; the mothers of France love to make  gracious pictures of their children. The Duke laid his hand upon my golden  curls. &lsquo;What a lovely boy!&rsquo; he exclaimed, deeply moved by my infantine beauty;  &lsquo;I prophesy a brilliant future for him. This child will go far.&rsquo; I hope,  Monsieur, that my after-life has not belied the great man&rsquo;s prophecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Distin assures me that you have won  distinction in your calling,&rdquo; replied Heathcote, wondering how long the old  gentleman&rsquo;s recollections of childhood were going to last. &ldquo;Your narrative  takes me back to a period that is classical. It assures me also that you who so  vividly remember the events of sixty years ago&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than sixty, Monsieur. I am past seventy years  of age, I who speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote put on an appropriate expression of  wonder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With such a memory for the remote past, it will  hardly trouble you to recall the events of ten years ago,&rdquo; he continued, very  eager to come to the point. &ldquo;Now, exactly ten years ago, in this very month of  September, there was a brutal murder, or attempted murder, of a woman, in a  wood near Paris&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean the murder of Marie Pr&eacute;vol the  actress, in the forest of Saint-Germain?&rdquo; inquired the police-officer. &ldquo;I was  engaged in that case. A very strange story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the woman was really murdered?&rdquo; asked  Heathcote, pale with agitation.</p>
<p>He was confounded by the ease with which the man  fixed upon a notorious crime, upon a given date. It would have surprised him  less to find that the child&rsquo;s vision of murder was a mere fever-dream &mdash; the  repetition of some morbid hallucination &mdash; than to hear of the reality off-hand,  in the broad light of day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really murdered! yes, and her lover too, as dead  as the Pharaohs. There never was a more genuine crime, a more determined  murder. The actress and her lover had gone to Saint-Germain for a holiday  jaunt. They went by rail, dined at the Henri Quatre, hired a carriage in the  cool of the evening, drove on the terrace, and then into the forest. They left  the carriage at a point where there were cross-roads, and pursued their ramble  on foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a child with them?&rdquo; interrogated  Heathcote breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, a little girl, the actress&rsquo;s niece. She was  the only witness of the crime. It was from her lips that the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em> took down the history  of the scene. They were walking quietly in the twilight, it was nearly dark,  the child said, and she was beginning to feel frightened. The lovers were  walking arm in arm, the child by her aunt&rsquo;s side. Suddenly a man sprang out  upon them from the darkness of the wood, and confronted them with a pistol in  his hand. He wore no hat, and he looked wild and furious. He aimed first at the  man, who fell without a groan. The girl had just time to call out to him not to  shoot her aunt, when he fired a second time, and then a third and a fourth, and  again, quicker than the child could count. It was evidently a six-chambered  revolver. Marie Pr&eacute;vol was found with her breast riddled with bullets. The  driver heard the shots from his post at the cross-roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was the murderer never found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. In spite of his wild appearance and his  bare head, he got clean off, and all the police of Paris failed in tracing  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But was there no one suspected of the crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There was a former lover of Marie&rsquo;s, her  first lover; and, as it was said, the only man she had ever really cared for.  They had been a devoted couple &mdash; were supposed by some to be married &mdash; and  until a short time before the murder Marie&rsquo;s character had been considered  almost stainless. Then a younger admirer appeared on the scene. There were  violent quarrels. The actress seemed to have lost her head, to be infatuated by  this aristocratic lover, one of the handsomest men in Paris. She had known him  only a few months when they went for this jaunt to Saint-Germain &mdash; a stolen  adventure. They were supposed to have been followed by the other man, and that  the murder was an act of jealous madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the crime was never brought home to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. Beyond the fact of his relations with  Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol, and of his disappearance immediately after the murder,  there was nothing to connect him with the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it was difficult, indeed almost  impossible, for any man to leave France without the knowledge of the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult; and at that time it was  particularly difficult, as the crimes of the Commune were still of recent date,  and the police were more than usually alert. But this man did it. All the great  railway-stations and sea-ports were closely watched for the appearance of such  a man among the departures; but he was never identified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have no doubt in your own mind that this  man was the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the shadow of doubt. There was no one else who  had any motive for assailing Marie and her admirer. Except in her relations  with these two she had been propriety itself. Unless you can imagine a  motiveless maniac dashing through a wood and shooting the first comer, you can  hardly conceive any other cause than jealousy for such a crime as this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the name of the man who was  suspected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at this moment; but I have the whole history  of the case in my workshop below, and if you would like to read it, there are  details that might interest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like much to read it.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter10"></a>Chapter 10<br>
  &ldquo;Touch Lips And Part With Tears&rdquo;</h2>
<p>While Edward Heathcote was on the other side of the  Channel trying to find a solution for the problem of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s death,  which should also be a complete acquittal of Hilda&rsquo;s suitor, Bothwell himself  was bent upon solving his own particular problem, that great perplexity of his  social life, which had weighed upon him more or less heavily for the last three  years. He had been to Plymouth twice since his decisive interview with Hilda;  but on each occasion it had been impossible for him to obtain so much as five  minutes&rsquo; <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with the lady he  went to see; and that which he had to say to her could not be said in five  minutes, or in five times five minutes. And now, while his champion was  faithfully toiling in his interest, and while Hilda was giving him all her  thoughts, and most of her prayers, Bothwell set out on his familiar Plymouth  journey for the third time within ten days, and with a letter in his pocket  which held out the hope of an opportunity for confidential talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked miserable the last time you were here,&rdquo;  wrote the lady, &ldquo;and you looked as if you had something very serious to say to  me. I am bored to death by the General&rsquo;s hangers-on &mdash; he is much too kind to  the nobodies who besiege us here &mdash; and I hardly ever know what it is to be  alone. But if you will come to-morrow, I will take care to keep other people  out. I shall pretend a headache, and deny myself to everybody. You must walk  boldly in by the garden, contrive not to meet any of the servants, and you will  find me sitting in the colonnade. It will all seem accidental. When the General  comes to his afternoon tea, he will find you there, and we shall tell him how  you wandered in, and forced the <em>consigne</em>.  You are such a favourite that he will smile at a liberty from you which he  would be the first to resent in any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell sat in his corner of the railway-carriage,  meditating upon this letter in his breast-pocket. How hard and cruel and false and  mean the whole tone of the lady&rsquo;s correspondence seemed to him, now that the  glamour of a fatal infatuation had passed from his brain and his senses; now  that he was able to estimate the enchantress at her real value; now that his  newly-awakened conscience had shown him the true colour of his own conduct  during the last three years!</p>
<p>Three years ago and a stroke of good fortune had  happened to Bothwell Grahame one day in the hill-country, when he and his  brother-officers had gone out after big game. It had been his chance to save  the life of one of the most distinguished men in the service, General  Harborough, a man who at that time occupied an important official position in  the Bengal Presidency. Bothwell&rsquo;s presence of mind, courage, and rapid use of a  revolver had saved the General from the jaws of a leopard, which had crept upon  the party while they were resting at luncheon, after a long morning&rsquo;s  bear-shooting. General Harborough was the last man to forget such a service. He  took Bothwell Grahame under his protection from that hour, introduced him to  his wife, Lord Carlavarock&rsquo;s daughter, and one of the most elegant women in the  Presidency.</p>
<p>Favoured by such friends, Bothwell Grahame&rsquo;s life  in India became a kind of triumph. He was good-looking, well-mannered, a  first-rate shot, and an exceptional horseman. He could sing a part in a glee or  duet, and he waltzed to perfection. He was supposed to have a genius for  waltzing, and to become master of every new step as if by a kind of  inspiration. &ldquo;What is the last fashionable waltz in London?&rdquo; people asked him;  and he showed them the very latest glide, or swoop, or twist, as the case might  be. His friends told him all about it in their letters, he said. He always knew  what was going on in the dancing world.</p>
<p>Such a man, not too young nor yet too old &mdash; neither  a stripling nor a fogey &mdash; chivalrous, amiable, full of verve and enjoyment of  life, was eminently adapted to the holiday existence at Simla; and it was at  Simla that Bothwell Grahame became in a manner the fashion, looked up to by all  the young men of his acquaintance, petted by all the women. Nor did it appear  strange in the eyes of society that Lady Valeria Harborough should be  particularly kind to him, and should have him very often at her bungalow, which  was the centre of all that was gay, and elegant, and <em>spirituel</em> in the district. All the Simla jokes originated at the  Harborough bungalow. All the latest English fashions, the newest refinements in  the service of a dinner-table or the arrangement of afternoon tea, came from  the same source. Lady Valeria led the fashion, gave the note of taste  throughout that particular section of Indian society.</p>
<p>No, there was nothing exceptional in her kindness  to Captain Grahame. In the first place, he had saved her husband from being  clawed and mangled to death by a wild beast, a service for which a good wife  would be naturally grateful; and in the second place, Bothwell was only one of  a court of young men who surrounded Lady Valeria wherever she happened to be  living &mdash; but most of all up at the hills. She always spoke of them as &ldquo;boys,&rdquo;  and frankly admitted that she liked their admiration on account of its <em>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</em>.</p>
<p>For some time she talked of Bothwell Grahame as a  &ldquo;nice boy,&rdquo; in spite of his six-and-twenty years. She herself owned pensively  to seven-and-twenty. Tergiversation would have been vain, since the <em>Peerage</em> was open to all her friends,  with its dryasdust record, &ldquo;Valeria Hermione, born 1854.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was twenty-seven years of age, strikingly  elegant and interesting, if not actually handsome, and she had been two years  married to a man who had lately celebrated his sixty-eighth birthday. She had  accepted the General, and his splendid settlements, meekly enough. There had  been no undue persuasion, no domestic tyranny. Her suitor was a thorough  gentleman, wealthy, distinguished, and she was told that he could give her all  good things which a woman need care to possess. She would spend two or three  years with him in India, where he had an important official appointment; and then  she would return to England, where he had two country seats &mdash; one a villa near  Plymouth, the other a castle in Scotland &mdash; and a house in Grosvenor Square. As  one of four sisters, it became her to accept the fortune that had fallen into  her lap. She was, or she seemed to be, of a temperament that could be happy in  an union with a man old enough to be her grandfather. She seemed one of those  women born to shine and to rule rather than to love. No one who knew her  intimately feared any evil consequences from her marriage with the elderly  soldier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria will make General Harborough an admirable  wife,&rdquo; said the matrons and ancient maidens of the house of Carlavarock, &ldquo;and  she will be a splendid mistress for that fine old place in Perthshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valeria had never known what passionate feeling  meant till she gave her friendship to Bothwell Grahame. She had never thrilled  at a man&rsquo;s voice, or listened for a man&rsquo;s footstep, till she began to start at <em>his</em> voice and listen for <em>his</em> tread. The fatal love came upon her  like a fever, struck her down in the strength of her proud womanhood, made her  oblivious of duty, blind to honour, mastered her like a demoniac possession,  and from a spotless wife she became all at once a hypocrite and an intriguer.</p>
<p>O, those fatal days at Simla, the long idle  afternoons! The music and singing &mdash; the dances late in the night when cool  winds were blowing over the hills &mdash; the garden lit with lamps like glowworms &mdash;  the billiards and laughter, the light jests, the heavy sighs. There came a time  when Bothwell Grahame found himself bound by an iniquitous tie to the wife of  his most generous friend.</p>
<p>Their love was to be guiltless always &mdash; that is to  say, not the kind of love which would bring Lady Valeria Harborough within the  jurisdiction of the Divorce Court: not the kind of love which would make her  name a scandal and a hissing in the ears of all her English friends, a theme  for scorn and scoffing throughout the length and breadth of Bengal. But, short  of such guilt as this &mdash; short of stolen meetings and base allies, the  connivance of servants, the venal blindness of hotel-keepers &mdash; short of actual  dishonour &mdash; they were to be lovers. He was to be at her beck and call &mdash; to  devote all the leisure of his days to her society &mdash; to give not one thought to  any other woman &mdash; to wait patiently, were it ten or twenty years, for the good  old man&rsquo;s death: and then, after her ceremonial year of widowhood, all  deference to the world&rsquo;s opinion having been paid, he was to claim Lady Valeria  for his wife. This was the scheme of existence to which Bothwell Grahame had  pledged himself. For all the best years of his manhood he was to be a hypocrite  and an ingrate &mdash; the slave of a woman whose ascendency he dared not  acknowledge, waiting for a good man&rsquo;s death. That was the worst degradation of  all to a man of warm heart and generous feeling. All that was best and noblest  in Bothwell Grahame&rsquo;s nature revolted against the baseness of his position. To  grasp General Harborough&rsquo;s hand, and to remember how deliberately he and  Valeria had calculated the years which the good old man had yet to live, had  speculated upon the end drawing near, coming suddenly perhaps; to know that all  their hopes of happiness were based upon the husband&rsquo;s speedy death. There were  times, even in the first red dawn of passion, while he was proudest of this  woman&rsquo;s love, when he almost hated her for her disloyalty as a wife. Could  there be happiness or peace in a bond so made? And then the woman&rsquo;s  fascination, the absolute power of a passionate, resolute character over a weak  and yielding one, vanquished all his scruples, stifled the voice of conscience  and honour. Not Samson at the feet of Delilah was a more abject slave than  Bothwell in that luxurious idleness of the Indian hills, when the only purpose  life held seemed to be the desire to get the maximum of frivolous amusement out  of every day. There was no pastime too childish for Lady Valeria and her  admirers, no sport too inane. Yet the lady contrived to maintain her womanly  dignity even in the most infantine amusements, and was honoured as a queen by  all her little court of worshippers, from the bearded major, or the portly  lawyer, to the callow subaltern.</p>
<p>Bothwell&rsquo;s conduct towards her, and the lady&rsquo;s  manner to him, were irreproachable. If there were any difference, she was a  shade colder and more reserved in her treatment of him than of her other  slaves: but there were moments, briefest opportunities &mdash; a <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> of five minutes in a moonlit verandah, a little walk  down to the fountain, a ride in which they two were ahead of the rest just for  a few yards; moments when Valeria&rsquo;s impassioned soul poured forth its treasures  of love at this man&rsquo;s feet, with the reckless unreserve of a woman who risks  all upon one cast of the die. She, who had been deemed the coldest and proudest  of women &mdash; Diana not more chaste, an iceberg not more cold &mdash; she, Valeria  Harborough, had chosen to fall madly in love with a man who was her social  inferior, and who had tried his uttermost to escape from the net she had spread  for him. Weak as he was, he had not yielded willingly. He had fought the good  fight, had tried his hardest to be loyal and true. And then, in one moment, the  spell had been too strong for his manhood. One never-to-be-forgotten night,  they two standing beside the fountain, steeped in the golden light of the  southern stars, he had yielded himself up to the enchantment of the hour, to  the witchery of luminous violet eyes, brighter for a veil of tears. He had  drawn her suddenly to his heart, asked her passionately why she had made him  adore her, in spite of himself, against reason and honour; and she, with  tearful eyes looking up at him, had answered softly, &ldquo;Because it was my fate to  love you;&rdquo; and then she told him, in short, disjointed sentences, broken by  sobs, that she was not a wicked woman, that he must not scorn or loathe her,  even if he could not give her love for love. Never, till she knew him, had she  swerved by one hair&rsquo;s breadth from the line of strictest duty; never had she  known a thought which she need wish to hide from her husband. And then, in an  evil hour, he had become almost domesticated in her house, and his influence  had gradually enfolded her, like a cloud spread by a magician, and she had  awakened to a new life. She had learnt the meaning of that mystic word love.</p>
<p>From that night Bothwell was her slave. Touched,  flattered, possessed by this fatal love &mdash; too glad weakly to echo the woman&rsquo;s  favourite excuse, Fatality &mdash; he struggled no longer against this mutual  madness, which was half bliss and half pain. He belonged henceforth to Lady  Valeria &mdash; more completely enslaved than if she had been free to claim him  before the world as her affianced husband. Her lightest word, her lightest look  ruled him. He went where she told him, spent his days as she ordered. He had  been one of the hardest working officers in India up to this time, and his  branch of the service, the Engineers, was one which offered splendid chances of  promotion.</p>
<p>General Harborough had promised to do all that his  very considerable influence could do to push his young friend to the front; and  it seemed to the men who knew him best that Bothwell Grahame&rsquo;s fortune was  made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men whose heads are turned by the first  stroke of luck, and who never do anything after,&rdquo; said a canny old Scotch  major; &ldquo;but Grahame is thorough, and is not afraid of hard work. Take my word  for it, he&rsquo;ll get on just as young Robert Napier did forty years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, with the ball at his feet, Bothwell Grahame  suddenly dropped out of the game. He left off working altogether. He was the  slave of a woman who preferred her own pleasure in his society to his chances  of distinction: who said, &ldquo;Why should you work? There will be enough for both  of us by and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By and by meant when the good old General should be  lying in his grave. He was an old man: it was not possible to ignore that fact,  though he was erect as a dart, active, full of dignity and intellect &mdash; a man of  men. He was nearing the scriptural limit of threescore and ten, and the  inevitable end that comes to us all must come to him before the world was many  years older.</p>
<p>Nothing was further from Bothwell&rsquo;s thoughts than  the idea of being maintained by a wife; but he let Lady Valeria tempt him away  from his books or his laboratory, and suffered himself to become indifferent to  his profession, to care for nothing but the life he led in her boudoir or her  drawing-room.</p>
<p>And then there came new difficulties. Lady Valeria  was at heart a gamester. The excitement of cards or betting had become a  necessity to her in her Indian life. Soon after her arrival at Calcutta she had  won a thousand pounds in the Umballa Sweep, and that one stroke of luck had  been her ruin. She became a professional gambler, played high whenever there  was a possibility of so doing, and had her book for every great English race.  She awaited the telegrams that brought her the tidings of victory or defeat  with feverish impatience. The natural result followed: she was often in money  difficulties. Generous as her husband was, she feared to appeal to him on these  occasions. She knew that, of all types of womanhood, he most hated a gambling  woman. She had her pin-money, which was ample for all the ordinary requirements  and even extravagances of a woman of fashion. She dared not ask her husband for  more money. But she was not afraid to call upon her slave, Bothwell Grahame;  and Bothwell had to help her somehow, this wife of the future, who, in the days  to come, was to provide for him.</p>
<p>He helped her first by nominally lending &mdash; actually  giving her &mdash; every sixpence of his own patrimony, disposing, bit by bit, of  that little estate in Perthshire of which his ancestors had been so proud. When  he had beggared himself thus, he began to borrow of the Jews &mdash; always for Lady  Valeria &mdash; and finally found himself in such a mess, financially, that he had to  leave the army.</p>
<p>General Harborough heard of his difficulties, and  supposed they were all self-induced, but made the kindest excuses for the  sinner. He offered to pay Bothwell&rsquo;s debts, and implored him not to throw up  his career, with all its brilliant chances. The General was wounded to the  quick when his offers were steadfastly refused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman knows how to accept a service as well  as how to render one,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You saved my life, and I have never felt burdened  by the obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell stood before him, grave, pale, silent,  humiliated by his kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me, sir,&rdquo; he faltered at last. &ldquo;Believe  me, I am not ungrateful. There was a time when I would rather have accepted a  favour from you than from any other man living. But I am tired of the army. I  feel that I shall never get on. I have sent a statement of my affairs to my  cousin&rsquo;s husband, who has a genius for finance. He will settle with my  creditors, and I shall begin the world again, my own man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell sighed involuntarily after those last  words. What freedom, or manhood, or independence could there ever be for him,  bound as he was bound?</p>
<p>He left India soon after this interview with the  General, who was to return to England in the following year. Lady Valeria  deeply resented her lover&rsquo;s conduct in leaving the East, while she was obliged  to remain there. It was desertion, infidelity. He ought to have remained at any  cost, at any loss of his own self-respect. She could never be brought to consider  things from his standpoint. If he had loved her, she argued, he would have  stayed. Love never counts the cost of anything. They parted in anger, and  Bothwell went home with a sore heart, yet with a sense of relief in the idea of  recovered freedom.</p>
<p>Then came a period of comparative liberty for  Bothwell. He received an occasional letter from Lady Valeria, full of  upbraidings and regrets. He answered as best he might &mdash; kindly, affectionately  even; but he flattered himself that the fatal tie, the dishonourable  engagement, was a folly of the past. He was all the more anxious to believe  this, during that peaceful winter at Penmorval, on account of his growing  esteem for another woman. O, what a different feeling it was, that winter love  of his! Those happy half-hours amidst the rimy hedgerows, with the shrill  north-easter swirling across the dark brown of the ploughed fields, the yellow  light of a setting sun shining beneath a leaden sky. How curiously different  was the girl&rsquo;s light happy talk in the English lane &mdash; talk which all the world  might have heard &mdash; from those impassioned whispers beside the fountain, under  the stars of Orient! At first it seemed to him that he was only soothed and  cheered by his acquaintance with Hilda Heathcote. He affected to consider her a  mere girl, hardly emerged from the nursery. He was surprised to find how  rightly she thought upon the gravest subjects. Then all at once he awoke to the  knowledge that he loved her: and while he was hesitating, doubting whether he  were free to indulge this new and purer, sweeter, happier love, hardly daring  to ask himself whether that old tie was or was not cancelled, he received a  letter from Valeria, with the Paris postmark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just arrived here from Brindisi,&rdquo; she  wrote. &ldquo;We shall stay here for a few days while I order some gowns, and we  shall be in London for a few weeks. After that we go to the General&rsquo;s place  near Plymouth, where you must come and see me every day, just as you used at  Simla. O Bothwell, I can hardly trust myself to write. I dare not tell you half  the joy I feel in the idea of our meeting. If you cared for me you would come  to London. It would be so easy to pretend business, and you would be warmly  welcomed in Grosvenor Square. You might bring your portmanteau and stop with us.  There is a barrack of empty rooms on the third floor. Ours is one of those huge  corner houses, and the piggeries for the servants are over the offices at the  back. I hope you will contrive to come. Your last letter seemed to me so cold  and distant &mdash; as if you were beginning to forget, or as if you had not forgiven  my anger at your desertion. Ah, Bothwell, you should have pitied me and  sympathised with me in that cruel parting. You ought to have known that my  anger was despair. But you thought only of your own dignity, your own  self-respect &mdash; not of my sorrow. Men are so selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell did not go to London. He excused himself  upon various grounds, and remained quietly at Penmorval. But from that hour his  manner to Hilda changed altogether. From an unavowed lover he became an  indifferent acquaintance. He set a watch upon his tongue that it should say no  words of pleasantness. He vowed that he would not again suffer himself to be  enmeshed in Lady Valeria&rsquo;s net: but until he had calmly and deliberately broken  with her he could not be the lover of any other woman. He made up his mind that  so soon as the General and his wife were settled at Fox Hill there should be a  rupture &mdash; temperate, gentle, firm, and irrevocable.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria came to Fox Hill, and summoned her  slave. He went, and there was no rupture &mdash; only a renewal of the old bonds. The  bird was in the fowler&rsquo;s net again. Bothwell was often at Fox Hill. He spent  long afternoons there <em>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</em> with Lady Valeria. She was less careful than she had been in India.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not surrounded with busybodies here,&rdquo; she  said. &ldquo;I feel that I can do as I like in my own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to London to borrow money for her when she  was in difficulties about that horrible book of hers: and Lady Valeria&rsquo;s normal  state now was financial difficulty. Almost everybody knew that she was a  gambler, except her husband. He was so thoroughly respected and beloved that no  one had the heart to make him unhappy by breathing a word to his wife&rsquo;s  discredit. He thought her faultless.</p>
<p>She had hardened in that false wicked life of hers:  but she was more fascinating than ever, Bothwell thought, albeit he was far  less under her spell than he had been in the old days at Simla. The very fever  of her mind intensified her charm. She seemed such an ethereal creature &mdash; all  life, and light, and sparkle. She was, to other women, as the electric light is  to gas.</p>
<p>And now, half buried in his corner of the  railway-carriage, Bothwell smoked the pipe of meditation. He looked back upon  that fatal past, and cursed himself for the weak folly that had put such a  chain round his neck. He looked back, and recalled the old scenes, the old  feelings, and he almost wondered if he could be the same man who had so felt  and so acted.</p>
<p>He drove to Fox Hill as fast as a cab-horse would  take him, alighted a little way from the chief gates, and dismissed his  conveyance, meaning to walk back to Plymouth after his interview. Fox Hill was  four miles from the station, but Bothwell could walk four miles in an hour with  that free swinging stride of his. A four-mile walk and a pipe might just serve  to quiet his nerves after the ordeal he had to undergo.</p>
<p>The General&rsquo;s Devonshire home was an Italian villa,  built on the southern slope of an amphitheatre of hills, and commanding the  town, the dockyards, the Hamoaze, and the Hoe in all their extent. Distance  lent enchantment to the view. Plymouth, seen from this sunny hillside, looked  as picturesque as Naples.</p>
<p>The villa had been planned by an architect of taste  and culture, and built regardless of expense. The house was not large when  measured by the number of its rooms; but all the rooms were spacious,  lightsome, and lofty. The decorations were of the simplest. The glory of the  place was its conservatories, which were so arranged as to introduce flowers  and tropical foliage into every part of the dwelling. A long marble colonnade,  enclosed by plate-glass shutters in winter or bad weather, surrounded the  house, and here bloomed and flourished all that is rarest and loveliest in  modern horticulture. The central hall had a glass roof, and was more a  conservatory than a hall. The corridors between drawing-room and dining-room,  between boudoir and study, were indoor gardens. Flowers pervaded the house, and  harmonised admirably with the elegant simplicity of the furniture, the  draperies of delicate chintz and soft India muslin.</p>
<p>The villa had been built sixty years ago, in the  days of the Georges, a period when Italian colonnades, Corinthian porticoes,  and Pompeian conservatories were the rage; but the house suited Lady Valeria  just as a well-chosen frame suits a picture.</p>
<p>On this summery September morning Lady Valeria was  seated in the colonnade, half reclining in one of those very low chairs which  she always affected, being one of the few women who can rise gracefully from a  seat about a foot from the ground. She was half hidden by the foliage of  oleanders and magnolia, and it was only by a glimmer of white amongst the  glossy green that Bothwell descried her in the distance as he crossed the lawn.  There was a fountain on the lawn here, just as at Simla; but the fountain was a  late improvement, insisted upon by Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will recall Simla, where we were so happy,&rdquo; she  told her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet you were so impatient to leave India,  towards the last,&rdquo; he said, almost reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was very tired of India at the last. There  is an end of all things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell had obeyed Lady Valeria&rsquo;s instructions to  the letter. He had entered the grounds by a side gate, so as to escape  challenge at the lodge: and now he made his way boldly to the colonnade in  front of her boudoir. The boudoir was not a particularly sacred apartment, as  it formed one in the suite of rooms and conservatories which communicated along  the whole length of the house. Italian villas of the Georgian era were not  planned for seclusion.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria was sitting in her low chair, with a  low table at her side, scattered with books and newspapers. The books were  mostly new memoirs and French novels of the most advanced school. The papers  were chiefly sporting. She looked up languidly as Bothwell approached, and gave  him her hand, like an empress, without stirring from her graceful repose amidst  embroidered silken cushions. She was not beautiful. Her charm lay in an extreme  refinement of feature and figure, a delicacy of tint which verged upon  sickliness. It was the refinement of a vanishing race, and recalled the  delicacy of an over-trained racehorse.</p>
<p>Her complexion was almost colourless in repose, but  the lips were of the tint of pale-pink rose petals, and every emotion flushed  the waxen cheek with loveliest bloom. Her nose was long and thin, too long for  perfect beauty. Her chin was a thought too sharp, her brow too narrow. But her  eyes were exquisite. Herein lay her one grand charm, and Lady Valeria well knew  the power of those large violet eyes, fringed with darkest lashes, accentuated  by pencilled brows &mdash; eyes which seemed to fill with tears at will &mdash; eyes which  could plead more eloquently than lips ever spoke since the days of Eve, first  tempted and then tempter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you are not really ill,&rdquo; said Bothwell,  seating himself in the chair opposite Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only worried to death,&rdquo; she answered, with an  irritated air. &ldquo;I have troubles enough to send me into an early grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money troubles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money troubles. Yes. I have other troubles, too,  but the money troubles are the most urgent. They gnaw the sharpest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been losing again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was so lucky with my Goodwood book that I  grew bold &mdash; determined upon a great <em>coup</em> at York, put every farthing I could scrape together upon Crofter, the second  favourite for the Great Ebor. I had been assured that it was the safest thing  in the world. I might back him with my wedding-ring, Sir George Varney said.  And York has generally been lucky to me, you know. It is my own county, and I  love every inch of it. The Knavesmire was the first racecourse I ever saw, the  place where I first learned to love horses, and to understand them. My father  used to tell me everything about the races. I was the only one of us who was  really interested in his talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought the money from Davis, and the money you  won at Goodwood, cleared all your difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for the moment. But this York business has  made things worse than they were before. However, you need not disturb yourself  about it. Varney has offered to lend me the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She said this slowly, with drooping eyelids, and a  thoughtful air; but she stole a little look at Bothwell from beneath the long  dark lashes, to see how he took her speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not take a sixpence of his money &mdash; not a  sixpence,&rdquo; said Bothwell sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No? That is exactly my idea. It would be very bad  form for a woman in my position to borrow from Varney &mdash; who is &mdash; well, a man of  the world. But I must have the money somehow. The bookmakers won&rsquo;t wait. They  only give credit in my case because they know I dare not cheat them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely the bookmen do not know that you are their  creditor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not supposed to know. The bets are made  in my brother&rsquo;s name &mdash; Otho&rsquo;s &mdash; who has been in Australia for the last two  years. But I don&rsquo;t believe these men would trust Otho, even if he were in  London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Bothwell, deeply  distressed. &ldquo;You ought not to have entangled yourself again. What makes you do  this thing, Valeria? It is worse than chloral, or any other form of feminine  madness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is a kind of madness, I suppose. I should  not do it if I were happy. I shall have no need to do it when I am happy &mdash; by  and by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again she stole a look at him, a tender pathetic  look, which would have melted him a year ago. But it left him unmoved now. He  felt only anger at her folly, her obstinate persistence in wrong-doing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not take Varney&rsquo;s money,&rdquo; he repeated,  &ldquo;not for worlds. To think that you should have secret dealings with such a man  &mdash; a hardened scamp and <em>rou&eacute;!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to accept Sir George&rsquo;s offer &mdash;  which was at least good-natured, so you need not be uncivil about him,&rdquo; replied  Valeria coolly; &ldquo;but I must get the money somehow. I don&rsquo;t want Otho&rsquo;s name to  be posted at Tattersall&rsquo;s. There are too many people who would guess that Otho  stands for Valeria in this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be disgraceful, horrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it will happen, I&rsquo;m afraid, unless I can get  the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can find no more, Valeria. That last loan from  Davis was most difficult to manage. I had positively no security to offer. The  money was advanced on the strength of Wyllard&rsquo;s position, on the speculation  that he would not see me broke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not asking you to pay my debts,&rdquo; she replied with  her grand air: the air of a woman accustomed to be admired for every attribute  of her character, good or bad, and to do wrong with impunity. &ldquo;But the money  must be found somehow, and perhaps you can tell me where I am to get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From your husband,&rdquo; he answered impetuously. &ldquo;Yes,  Valeria, from your one true and loyal friend. The one man you can ask in all  honour to pay for your follies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You advise me to go to him!&rdquo; exclaimed Valeria,  livid with anger. &ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I &mdash; I, who have wronged him deeply by a most  fatal engagement which I have regretted ever since it was made. Not because you  are not lovely, fascinating, all that is fairest and most desirable in  womankind: but because I am hateful to myself on account of that treachery.  What! to be the affianced lover of a woman whose husband&rsquo;s hand I grasped in  seeming friendship: to smile in his face, to accept his kindness, his  friendship, his confidence, while all my life was one long waiting for his  death, while you and I were saying to each other every day, by and by we will  do this, by and by we will go here and there, sail our yacht in the  Mediterranean, build our cottage on the Scotch moor, by and by, when that good  man who trusted us both is in his grave! O, it has been a hateful position,  Valeria, base, miserable, guilty, accursed, for both of us: and, by the God who  made us, it must come to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been tears in his voice almost from the  beginning of his speech, and at the end he broke down altogether and sobbed  aloud.</p>
<p>Valeria rose out of her low chair, and stood before  him straight as a dart. The movement was so quick, so instinct with an unholy  grace, that it recalled the image of a cobra he had once seen rise up straight  before him in the midst of his path through the jungle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in love with another woman!&rdquo; she hissed,  like the serpent. &ldquo;<em>That</em> is the  meaning of this sudden outbreak of virtue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not deny it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to break with me, in order that you may  marry some one else,&rdquo; she said, whiter than death, her eyes dilating, her lips  quivering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered quietly. &ldquo;I could form a happier  tie if you set me free. But there is not one word which I said just now about  the feeling of my own baseness which was not just as true two years ago as it  is to-day. Such a bond as ours never could bring happiness, Valeria, to man or  to woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave us hope,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;a fair dream of the  future. Well, it is all over. Whatever it is worth it is gone &mdash; like a tuft of  thistledown blown into the air. Go, Bothwell Grahame, you are your own man  again; go and marry your new love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not be a marriage of to-day or to-morrow,&rdquo;  answered Bothwell gravely. &ldquo;My new love and I will have to wait for better  times. First, I am a pauper; and, secondly, there is a taint upon my name,  inasmuch as the good people of Bodmin and the neighbourhood have taken it into  their wise heads that I am a murderer, because I refused to answer some very  impertinent questions at the inquest. Valeria, will you forgive me &mdash; will you  believe &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you were heartily tired of me ages ago,  before you left India,&rdquo; she said, interrupting him with a feverish rapidity.  She had sunk into her low chair again, and was seated with her hands clasped  upon the basket-work, bedizened with trappings of Oriental embroidery, like an  Arab&rsquo;s horse &mdash; her eyes gazing over the wide panorama of land and sea, the  dockyards, the river, the lighthouse yonder, and the long line of surf dashing  against the breakwater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that you were weary of me long before  that bitter good-bye,&rdquo; she went on, breathless with passion, her sentences  broken into short gasps. &ldquo;I think I knew even then that you were false, though  I pretended to myself that you were true. I don&rsquo;t believe you ever loved me.  You just let me love you, that was all. If you had really cared for me &mdash; as  other men have cared for other women &mdash; you would not have been so obedient. You  would have flung prudence to the winds &mdash; you would have made scenes &mdash; you would  have wanted to run away with me. No, you never loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would have been vain now for Bothwell to protest  the reality of the old worn-out passion. It had never been of the strongest  stuff that love is made of, and it had long been growing threadbare. He had  received his release, and that was the boon he had come here to ask. But he  could not leave the woman he had once loved without one word of peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria,&rdquo; he said gently, tenderly even, &ldquo;I shall  stay here till you forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you stay until you have forced me to tell a  lie? There can be no blacker lie than any word of mine that offered forgiveness  to you. You have deceived me cruelly. You were my strong rock, and I leant upon  you for comfort. O Bothwell, what is she like, this other woman for whom you  forsake me? Is she so much more beautiful &mdash; so much younger &mdash; fresher than I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is good, and pure, and true, and has been  brave and loyal when the world spoke evil of me! That is all I can tell you  about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she is handsome, I suppose? You are not going  to marry a plain woman, out of gratitude!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is lovely in my eyes; and I believe she is  generally considered a pretty girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lady. I can tell you no more yet awhile. Hark!  there is the General&rsquo;s voice. I had better go. Stay, there is something you  once gave me. You told me to wear it till &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till you were tired of me. Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she  said impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till the tie was broken between us, in somewise,&rdquo;  he answered, taking out his watch.</p>
<p>There was about three inches of slender  Trichinopoly chain on the swivel of the watch, and on the chain hung an  old-fashioned hoop-ring of old Brazilian diamonds. The ring had belonged to  Lord Carlavarock&rsquo;s grandmother, and had been Valeria&rsquo;s favourite jewel.</p>
<p>She snatched it from Bothwell&rsquo;s hand the moment he  had taken it off the chain, and flung it with all her force into the nearest  thicket of shrubs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much for the token of worn-out love!&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;If one of the gardeners finds it, he will pawn it at Devonport, and spend the  money in drink. A worthy end for such a souvenir. Good-bye, Mr. Grahame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell bowed and left her; left her to crawl up  to her bedroom like a wounded hind creeping to covert, and to fling herself  face downwards on the floor, and lie there tearless, despairing, ready to  invoke hell itself to help her in some kind of revenge, had she but believed in  the devil. But Lady Valeria was an agnostic. She had not even Satan as a friend  in the hour of trouble.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter11"></a>Chapter 11<br>
  A Fatal Love</h2>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde and his visitor descended the  ladder, and entered the police-officer&rsquo;s apartment, which consisted of two  small rooms, the outer an office and <em>salon</em> combined, the inner a bedchamber, which Mr. Heathcote saw through the open  door: a neat little bachelor&rsquo;s nest, with a velvet-curtained bedstead, and  walls lined with portraits of every kind &mdash; engravings, lithographs,  photographs.</p>
<p>The <em>salon</em> was decorated with the same style of art, diversified by engravings from  newspapers, all representing notorious crimes. &ldquo;The Murder in the Rue de la  Paix,&rdquo; &ldquo;Germinie Latouche stabbed in the kitchen of the Red Cross Restaurant by  her lover, Gilles Perdie;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Arrest of Victor Larennes for the great  forgeries on the Bank of France;&rdquo; &ldquo;The Escape of Jean Bizat, the parricide.&rdquo;  Art had represented all these scenes with due dramatic fervour. They were hardly  pleasing subjects in the abstract; but to F&eacute;lix Drubarde they were all  delightful; for they recalled some of the most interesting and most profitable  hours of his life. He was gratified to see his guest looking at those stories  of crime, in artistic shorthand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gilles Perdie would have got off, if it had not  been for me,&rdquo; he said, with excusable pride. &ldquo;The police had been hunting for  him ten long days, when I put them on the right scent. We knew that he had not  gone far from the scene of the crime &mdash; for there had been no time for escape,  you see. The murder was found out an hour after the woman&rsquo;s death. He was  hunted for in every hole and corner within a radius of a mile. No one had seen  him leave the premises. No one had set eyes on him since the murder, which  occurred in the early morning in October, when it is not light before six. &lsquo;How  do you know that he ever did leave that house?&rsquo; I asked one day, meaning the  Red Cross, a workman&rsquo;s eating-house in the Rue Galande. He was cellarman there,  cellarman and <em>terreur</em> combined. My  comrades laughed at me. They had searched the Red Cross from cellar to garret,  they had not left an inch of the building unexplored. &lsquo;Have you looked in the  empty casks?&rsquo; I asked. Yes, they had looked in the empty casks. The cellar was  very neatly arranged, the empty casks in a row on one side, the full ones on  the other. My friends protested that they were not such fools as to have  overlooked an empty cask. &lsquo;Who knows?&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;we will go there this afternoon  and overhaul those barrels.&rsquo; Need I tell you the result? It is history. There  was one empty hogshead, artfully pushed in a corner, last in the rank of  unbroached hogsheads. The open end had been turned towards the wall, and in  that empty hogshead, in that rat-haunted cellar, Gilles Perdie had contrived to  exist for ten days, by the aid of his victim&rsquo;s daughter, a child of seven years  old, who lived in the house, and whom he threatened to kill as he had killed  her mother, if she told any one about him, or failed to carry him food and  drink twice a day. There, amidst vermin and ordure, he had lived, coiled up in  his hogshead, and perhaps not much worse off than some among the poor of Paris,  whose only crime is poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a right to boast of your scent, Monsieur,  after such a triumph as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bagatelle, Monsieur, one of the feeblest of my  cases: but it made a great hit at the time. My portrait appeared in three  different newspapers, side by side with that of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A distinguished honour. And now, if you will be  kind enough to give me the further information which you promised as to names  and details?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Effcotte, you are Mr. Distin&rsquo;s friend,  and for you I will do what I would hardly do for my own brother. I will trust  you with one of my books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are extremely obliging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, sir, that there are some people who think  nothing of lending a book; they can hand over a treasured volume to a friend &mdash;  to an indifferent acquaintance even &mdash; without a pang; they can see him turn the  leaves and violate the stiffness of the back. I, Monsieur, would almost as soon  lend my arm and hand as one of those books; but for you I will make an  exception. You shall have the volume which contains the report of the Pr&eacute;vol  case, to read and take notes from at your leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more than good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde&rsquo;s library consisted of four rows  of handsomely bound volumes, whose gilded backs shone behind a barricade of  plate glass, in a locked bookcase. They were books which he had collected at  his leisure, and which bore for the most part on his profession: the memoirs of  Vidocq, the memoirs of Canler, of Sanson the executioner, and other biographies  of equally thrilling interest. For literature of so lofty a stamp, F&eacute;lix  Drubarde had deemed no binding too luxurious; and he had clothed his favourites  in all the pomp of purple, and green, and crimson, and sumptuous gilding. He  had caused them to be enriched with the bookbinder&rsquo;s whole gamut of ornament &mdash;  his <em>fleurs-de-lis</em> and roses, his  foliage and acorns, and scrolls and emblems. Even the volume of printed reports  which Drubarde handed to Mr. Heathcote was gorgeous in red morocco and gold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will find the case fully reported in that  volume,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When you have read it, and made your own conclusions upon  it, you can come back to me, and we will talk the matter over together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call upon you again to-morrow at the same  hour, if you will allow me,&rdquo; replied Heathcote, laying a ten-pound note upon  the table. &ldquo;But I must ask you in the mean time to accept this trifle as an  earnest of future remuneration. I do not on any account desire to impose on  your good-nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde shrugged his shoulders, declared  that as a matter of feeling he would rather work gratuitously for any friend of  Mr. Distin&rsquo;s, but that from a business point of view his time was valuable. He  had a little place in the country, fifteen miles out of Paris; he had nephews  and nieces dependent upon him; in a word, he had to work for others as well as  for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before you go, perhaps you will be so good as to  tell me your motive for hunting up the history of this old murder,&rdquo; he said,  with a keen look. He had been intending to ask this question from the  beginning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am searching out the details of an old murder in  order to fathom the mystery of a new murder, or of a strange death, which I  take to be a murder. Can you read English, Monsieur Drubarde?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a niece who can &mdash; a girl who was educated  at a convent in Jersey. I am going to my country home this afternoon, and my  niece can read anything you give me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote took from his pocket-book the report  of the inquest, cut out of the local papers, and pasted on slips of foolscap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your niece will translate that report for you,  I think you will understand the motive of my investigation,&rdquo; he said; and then  bade Monsieur Drubarde good-morning.</p>
<p>He went down-stairs with the volume of reports  under his arm, hailed a fly, and drove to the H&ocirc;tel de Bade, stopping on his  way to engage a stall for that evening at the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, the only  recreation which he cared for in his present frame of mind. He had numerous  acquaintances in Paris, but he did not care about seeing one of them just now,  nor did he linger in the bright gay streets to mark the changes which a year  had made in the aspect of that ever-varying city, as he would have done had his  mind been free from care.</p>
<p>He had a sitting-room and bedroom on the second  floor of the hotel, two nice little rooms opening into each other, and both  overlooking the Boulevard; an outlook which on former occasions he had  preferred to the monastic quiet of the courtyard, where there were no sounds  but the splashing of the water with which the man-of-all-work sluiced the stone  pavement at intervals of an hour or two on sultry summer afternoons, or the  scream of a chambermaid arguing with a waiter, both talking as loud as if they  had been communicating from the gate of Saint-Martin to the gate of  Saint-Denis. To-day, with the report of the Pr&eacute;vol case open before him, Edward  Heathcote could have found it in his heart to curse the Boulevard, with its  roar and rattle, its incessant &ldquo;ya-youp!&rdquo; of coachmen on the point of running  over passengers, and everlasting clamour of the lively Gaul. He would have  preferred a hermit&rsquo;s cave, with never a sound but the sighing of the wind on  the mountain-side.</p>
<p>Yes, here was the interrogation of the waiter at  the Pavilion Henri Quatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember a lady and gentleman who dined in  a private room on the 6th of September?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The waiter remembered perfectly. The lady was very  pretty, the gentleman remarkably handsome, and with a distinguished air. They  had a little girl with them. The gentleman ordered a private room and a little  dinner, <em>bien soign&eacute;</em>. He was very  particular about the champagne, and about the dessert. The grapes and peaches  were to be of the choicest. The gentleman and lady dined early, between five  and six. The lady had a somewhat agitated air, seemed out of sorts, and ate  very little. The gentleman was very attentive to her, and petted the little  girl. At half-past six they went for a drive in the forest. The carriage was  ordered directly they sat down to dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you any reason to suppose that this lady and  gentleman had been followed or watched, by any one when they arrived at the  Henri Quatre?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They arrived in a fly. No; I observed no one  lurking about or watching when they arrived. I went out to give an order to the  coachman while the carriage was standing before the door, waiting to take them  for their drive in the forest; and I observed a man on the other side of the  road. I should not have noticed him, perhaps, if the collar of his overcoat had  not been turned up in a curious manner. I thought it strange that any one  should wear an overcoat on such an evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did this man appear to be watching the hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was standing in front of the hotel-railings  when I went out. I saw him look across at the window in which the lady and  gentleman were dining. The window was at right angles with the road, opening  into a garden. It was open, and there were two candelabra upon the table. Any  one could see into the room from the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no blind or curtain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. The evening was particularly mild. All the  windows in the sitting-rooms were open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of this man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walked rapidly along the road, and turned the  corner on to the terrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you recognise him if you were to see him  again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible. It was twilight when I saw him, and he  was on the other side of the road. His coat-collar was turned up, so as to hide  the lower half of his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must at least have observed his general  appearance. Was he tall or short? Had he the air of a gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was tall. Yes, I should say he was a  gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young or old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He walked like a young man. I thought he had an  agitated air. He walked very quickly, but stopped suddenly two or three times  between the hotel and the corner of the terrace, as if he were thinking deeply  &mdash; hesitating whether to go this way or that; and then he walked on again,  faster than before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw no more of him that evening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. At half-past eight o&rsquo;clock I heard that there  had been a double murder in the forest, and that the bodies were lying at the  Town Hall. I went to see the bodies, and recognised the lady and gentleman who  had dined at our hotel. I also saw the little girl, who was in the charge of  the police. She was crying bitterly. The corpses were removed to Paris on the  following evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The examination of the driver came next. He had  very little to tell. He had been told to wait at the cross-roads until the lady  and gentleman returned from their stroll. It was a lovely night &mdash; a night which  might have tempted any one to alight and walk in the forest glade. The moon was  rising, but it was dark amid the old trees. The man had been waiting about a  quarter of an hour, when he heard a shot a little way off &mdash; and then another,  and another, and another, in rapid succession &mdash; and then he heard a child  screaming. He tied his horse to a tree, and he ran into the glade, guided by  the screams of the child. He found the lady and gentleman lying on the ground,  side by side, the child kneeling by the lady; and screaming with grief and  terror. The gentleman groaned two or three times, and then expired. The lady  neither stirred nor moaned. Her light-coloured gown and mantle were covered  with blood.</p>
<p>The driver was questioned as to whether anybody had  passed him while he waited at the crossroads. No, he had not observed any one,  except an old woman and a boy who had been gathering sticks in the forest. The  place at which he was waiting was a well-known point. The glade in which the  murder occurred was considered one of the most picturesque spots in the forest.  He always drove there with people who wanted to see the beauties of  Saint-Germain. But at that late hour there were very few people driving. He had  met no carriage after leaving the terrace.</p>
<p>Then followed the examination of the child, and of  Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s mother. They were both lengthy, for the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em> had applied himself with peculiar earnestness to  the task of unravelling this mystery, and it was only in the details of the  dead woman&rsquo;s surroundings that the clue to the secret could be found.</p>
<p>The child had evidently answered the magisterial  questions with extreme intelligence. However she might have broken down  afterwards, she had been perfectly rational at the time of the interrogatory.  It seemed to Heathcote, influenced, perhaps, by his knowledge of after events,  that the child&rsquo;s replies indicated a hyper-sensitiveness, and an intellect  intensified by feverish excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember going to Saint-Germain with your  aunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all you can recall about that day. Tell me  exactly when and how you started, and what happened to you on the way. I want  to hear everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was three o&rsquo;clock when we left my aunt&rsquo;s house.  Monsieur de Maucroix came a little before that, and asked my aunt to go to  dinner with him somewhere in the country. The weather was too lovely for Paris,  he said. She did not want to go. She said Georges would be angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one I never saw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a friend of your aunt&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so. She often talked of him. Monsieur  de Maucroix used to talk of him, and to be angry about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why angry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He used to say Georges will not let  you do this; Georges will not let you do that. What right has Georges that he  should order you here or there? And then my aunt used to cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you often at your aunt&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very often.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lived there sometimes, did you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I used to stay there for a week sometimes. It  was very nice to be with my aunt, much nicer than being with grandmother. She  used to take me out in a carriage sometimes. Her rooms were prettier than  grandmother&rsquo;s rooms, for there were flowers all about, and pretty things, and  she was prettier, and wore prettier clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you were there for a week at a time, how  was it that you never saw this Monsieur Georges, who was such a close friend of  your aunt&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never came till late at night. He used to come  to supper often. I heard the servant say so. She said he was a dissipated man,  a bad subject. Grandmother said so too. &lsquo;Has that night-bird been here again?&rsquo;  she asked my aunt once; and my aunt was angry, and began to cry; and then  grandmother got angry too, and said, &lsquo;Who is he, and what is he? I want to know  that.&rsquo; And then my aunt said, &lsquo;He is a gentleman; that is enough for you to  know;&rsquo; and then she showed my grandmother a pretty necklace that Georges had  given her the night before &mdash; a necklace of shining white beads, like the  water-drops from the fountain at the Tuileries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were diamonds, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is what grandmother called them. She  wetted them with her tongue to find out if they were real diamonds, and then  she and my aunt kissed each other, and made friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you never saw this Monsieur Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. My aunt used to send me to bed very early,  before she went to the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she not take you with her to the theatre  sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. She said that theatres were not good for  little girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me about your journey to Saint-Germain.  How did you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First in a carriage, and then in a train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you to wait at the station?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long time. I was tired of waiting so long. I  thought it would have been nicer to be at home, where I had story-books to  read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your aunt and Monsieur de Maucroix do  while they were waiting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They sat in a corner of a big room, with great  windows through which we could see the trains. I watched the trains through the  window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were there many other people in the room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you take notice of any one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I noticed a little girl. She was bigger than I am,  but not much. I thought I should like to play with her. She had a blue balloon,  and she let it fly out of the window and broke it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you notice nobody else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only one other person &mdash; a gentleman who wore dark  spectacles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What made you observe him in particular?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His spectacles were so curious, and he looked at  my aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean when you say that he looked at  your aunt? Did he look as if he knew her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. He stood just inside the doorway, as  if he was hiding behind the door, looking at my aunt and Monsieur de Maucroix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long did he stand there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For five minutes, do you think? As long as you  could count a hundred?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Longer than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he young or old, tall or short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was tall. I think he must have been old,  because he wore dark spectacles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your aunt and Monsieur de Maucroix observe  him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I asked my aunt when we were in the train if  she had seen the gentleman with the funny spectacles, and she said no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see him again after he left the  waiting-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me all you can about your journey to  Saint-Germain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We went in the train, in a beautiful carriage with  soft cushions. I looked out of the window all the time. My aunt and Monsieur de  Maucroix sat by the other window talking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear what they said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much. I was not listening. It was so nice to  see the country, and the trees rushing by. I heard Monsieur de Maucroix ask my  aunt to go away with him &mdash; he begged her to go &mdash; to Italy, I think he said. Is  there a place called Italy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And how did your aunt answer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she could not go. She was bound to  Georges. Georges would kill her if she left him. Monsieur de Maucroix laughed,  and said that people do not do such things nowadays. He laughed &mdash; and soon  afterwards my aunt and he were both dead. I saw the blood &mdash; streams of blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, said the report, the girl Lemarque  became hysterical, and the rest of her evidence had to be postponed for another  day. In the mean time the grandmother, and Barbe Girot, Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s servant,  were interrogated.</p>
<p>Madame Lemarque stated that her daughter was an  actress at the Porte-Saint-Martin. She was very beautiful, and was more  renowned for her grace and beauty than for her acting. She danced and sang and  acted in fairy scenes. She was only three-and-twenty years of age at the time  of her death.</p>
<p>Upon being asked by the judge whether her daughter  led a strictly moral life, Madame Lemarque replied that her conduct was purity  itself as compared with that of many ladies who acted in fairy pieces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there was some one, perhaps,&rdquo; insinuated the  judge, &ldquo;there is always some one. So beautiful a woman must have had many  admirers. I have her photograph here. It is an exquisite face, a beauty quite  out of the common, refined, spiritual. Surely among her many admirers there  must have been one whom she favoured above all the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there was one, and it was that one who  murdered my daughter and Monsieur de Maucroix. No one can doubt it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have no actual knowledge of the fact? You  speak upon conjecture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who else should murder her? Whom did she ever  injure, poor child? She was amiability itself &mdash; the kindest of comrades,  charitable, good to everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you know of this person whom you suspect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing except that which I heard from my  daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. If he had been the Emperor he could not  have been more mysterious in his goings to and fro. I was never allowed to see  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he often at your daughter&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very often. He used to go there after the theatre.  He was devoted to her. There were some who believed that he was her husband,  that he loved her too passionately to deny her anything she might ask. When she  was not acting he took her abroad, to Italy &mdash; to Spain. If it were only for a  holiday for a fortnight, he would carry her off to some remote village in the  Italian Alps or the Pyrenees. I used to tell her that he was ashamed of his  love for her, or he would not have hidden her in those distant places. He would  have taken her to Dieppe or Arcachon, where she would have been seen and  admired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever find out who this person is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must know something about him and his  circumstances. Was he a nobleman, or did he belong to the mercantile class?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing except that he was rich. He  showered gifts upon my daughter. He would have taken her off the stage if she  would have allowed him. He would have given her a house and gardens at Bougival  instead of her little apartment on a third floor in the Rue Lafitte; but she  loved the theatre, and she had a proud spirit, poor child &mdash; she had not the  temper of <em>la femme entretenue</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the name of this person?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Georges. I never heard of him by any  other name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your daughter reciprocate his passion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a long time she seemed to do so. They were  like lovers in a story. That lasted for years &mdash; from the time of her first  appearance at the Porte-Saint-Martin, which was four years before her death.  And then there came a change. Monsieur de Maucroix fell in love with her,  followed her about everywhere, worshipped her. And he was young and handsome and  fascinating, with the style, and manners of a prince. He had spent all his life  in palaces; had been attached to the Emperor&rsquo;s household from his boyhood; had  fought bravely through the war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you reason to know that Monsieur Georges was  jealous of Monsieur de Maucroix?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my daughter told me that there had been  scenes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had the two men met?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long had Monsieur de Maucroix been an avowed  admirer of your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few months &mdash; since Easter, I think. My  granddaughter used to see him when she was staying with her aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you reconcile it to your conscience to allow  your grandchild to live in the house of an aunt who was leading &mdash; well, we will  say a doubtful life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no harm in my daughter&rsquo;s life that I knew  of. Monsieur Georges may have been my daughter&rsquo;s husband. There is no reason  that he should not have been. At her lodgings she was known as Madame Georges.  It was under that name she travelled when she went abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you had never heard of any marriage &mdash; at the  Mairie or elsewhere? And, again, your daughter could not be married without  your consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say that she had been married in France.  She may have been married abroad &mdash; in England, perhaps. He took her to England  soon after they became acquainted. It was the first time she left Paris with  him; and until then I know she had been as distant to him as if she had been  the Empress. In England there are no obstacles to marriage; there is no one&rsquo;s  consent to be asked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will admit that a marriage in a foreign country  would have been possible. But this Maxime de Maucroix, this second admirer &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was only an admirer. My daughter&rsquo;s life was not a  disreputable life. I have nothing to reproach myself with upon that score.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you help us to find this man Georges, whom you  suspect as the murderer? Do you know where he is to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, the police would have known before now.  I tell you I know nothing about him &mdash; absolutely nothing. I have seen and heard  nothing of him since the murder. He has not been to my daughter&rsquo;s apartment  since her death &mdash; he was not at her funeral. He who pretended to adore her did  not follow her to her grave. All Paris was there; but he who was supposed to be  her husband was not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tell that he was not there, since you  do not know his appearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barbe Girot knows him. It is on her authority that  I say he was not there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will trouble you with no further questions  to-day, madame. I will take Barbe Girot&rsquo;s evidence next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbe Girot&rsquo;s evidence was to the effect that for  nearly four years this Monsieur Georges had been a constant visitor at her  mistress&rsquo;s apartment. He had come there after the theatre, and it had been  Barbe&rsquo;s duty to leave the supper-table laid, and the candles ready on the chimney-piece  and table, before she went to bed. Madame Georges let herself in with a  latch-key, and Barbe rarely sat up for her. Madame did not always return to the  Rue Lafitte for supper. There were occasions when she supped on the Boulevard,  or in the Bois, and returned to her apartment at a very late hour. Barbe saw  Monsieur Georges occasionally, but not frequently. He was a handsome man, but  not in his first youth. He might have been five or six and thirty. He was  generous, and appeared to be rich. Whatever his fortune may have been, he would  have given Madame the whole of it if she had asked him. There was never a man  more passionately in love with a woman. After the Baron de Maucroix&rsquo;s  appearance on the scene there were storms. Barbe had seen Monsieur Georges cry  like a child. She had also seen him give way to violent passion. There had been  one night when she thought that he would kill Madame. He had his hands upon her  throat; he seemed as if he were going to strangle her. And then he fell on his  knees, and grovelled at her feet. He implored her to forgive him. It was  dreadful.</p>
<p>Did Barbe Girot think that Monsieur Georges was  Madame&rsquo;s husband?</p>
<p>She had never presumed to form an opinion upon that  subject. Her mistress wore a wedding-ring, and was always known as Madame  Georges in the house where she lived. Madame&rsquo;s conduct was altogether  irreproachable. Until the Baron de Maucroix began to visit her, no other man  than Monsieur Georges had crossed her threshold. And the visits of Monsieur de  Maucroix were such visits as any gentleman in Paris might pay to any lady, were  she the highest in the land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did your mistress ever go out with Monsieur de  Maucroix before that fatal visit to Saint-Germain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. And on that occasion Madame took the little  girl with her. She refused to go alone with the Baron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your opinion that your mistress was inclined  to favour Monsieur de Maucroix&rsquo; suit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, yes! He was so young, so fascinating, so  handsome, and he adored her. If she had not been in love with him she would  hardly have permitted his visits, for they were the cause of such agony of mind  to Monsieur Georges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your belief, then, that she had transferred  her affection from the older to the younger lover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not seen Monsieur Georges since the  murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that he was not at the funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there was a great crowd at the cemetery. How  can you be sure that he was not in the crowd?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot be sure of that; but I am sure that he  paid my mistress no honour. He was not among those who stood around her grave,  or who threw flowers upon her coffin. I stayed by the grave after all was over  and the crowd had dispersed; but Monsieur Georges never came near to cast a  look upon the spot where my poor mistress was lying. He has not been at her  apartment since her death; he never came to look upon her corpse when it was  lying there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has not written &mdash; he has given no orders as  to the disposal of your mistress&rsquo;s property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Madame Lemarque has taken possession of  everything. She is living in my mistress&rsquo;s apartment until the furniture can be  sold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know of any photograph or portrait of  Monsieur Georges among your late mistress&rsquo;s possessions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw any such portrait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would know Monsieur Georges wherever you might  happen to see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I do not think I could fail to recognise  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he had disguised himself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even then. I think I should know his voice  anywhere, even if I could not see his face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you describe him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a tall man, broad-shouldered,  powerful-looking. He has fine features, blue eyes, light-auburn hair, thick and  flowing, and worn much longer than most people wear their hair. He is not so  handsome or so elegant as Monsieur de Maucroix, but he has a more commanding  look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That description would apply to hundreds of men.  Can you mention any peculiarity of feature, expression, gait, manner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can recall nothing peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in moments of confidence did your mistress  never tell you anything about this Monsieur Georges, his profession, his  belongings, his place of residence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not live at your mistress&rsquo;s apartments, I  conclude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he did not live there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear how he was occupied during the  day, since you say he was never at your mistress&rsquo;s apartment in the daytime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. I was told nothing about him except that he  was rich and a gentleman. I asked no questions. My place was comfortable, my  wages were paid regularly, and Madame was kind to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did L&eacute;onie Lemarque sleep when she stayed in  the Rue Lafitte?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She occupied a little bed in my room, which is  inside the kitchen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you long in Madame&rsquo;s service?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly four years. From the beginning of her  engagement at the Porte-Saint-Martin, when she took the apartment in the Rue  Lafitte. Her salary at the theatre justified her in taking such an apartment.  Before that time she had been living with her mother on the other side of the  Seine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your opinion that Monsieur Georges was the  murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my fixed opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This concluded the examination of Barbe Girot. The  little girl&rsquo;s examination was not resumed until ten days later. She had been  very ill in the mean time, and seemed altogether weak and broken down when she  was brought before the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em>.  She burst out crying in the midst of her evidence, and the grandmother had  great difficulty in calming her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a nice dinner, and Monsieur de Maucroix was  very kind, and gave me grapes and a big peach, and he promised to buy me a doll  next day in the Passage Jouffroy. My aunt was sad, and Monsieur de Maucroix  begged her to be gay, and he talked about taking her to Italy with him, just as  he had talked in the train. And then we went out in a carriage and drove along  a terrace, where there was a beautiful view over a river and a great green  valley. My aunt seemed much gayer, and she and Monsieur de Maucroix were  talking and laughing all the time; and afterwards, when we all got out of the  carriage and walked in the forest, they both seemed very happy, and my aunt  rested her head on Monsieur de Maucroix&rsquo;s shoulder as they walked along, and  said it was like being in heaven to be in that moonlit forest with him; and  then, just at that moment, a man rushed out from the darkness under the trees, like  a wild beast out of a cave, and shot, and shot, and shot, again and again and  again. And first Monsieur de Maucroix fell, and then my aunt, and she was all  over blood. I could see it streaming over her light-blue gown, first one stream  and then another. I can see it now. I am seeing it always. It wakes me out of  my sleep. O, take it away; take away the dark forest; take away the blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, said the report, the child again  became hysterical, and had to be carried away. After this she had an attack of  brain-fever, and could not again be interrogated formally.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter12"></a>Chapter 12<br>
  L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s Mission</h2>
<p>The report of the interrogatory before the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em> was followed by a  page of notes written by the police-officer Drubarde.</p>
<p>The child L&eacute;onie Lemarque was not again in a  condition to give her evidence. A violent attack of brain-fever succeeded her  second appearance before the <em>Juge  d&rsquo;Instruction</em>, and on her recovery from the fever it was found that her  mind had suffered seriously from the shock she had undergone. Memory was a  blank. The <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em> visited  her in her own home when she was convalescent, and tried to recall the  impressions made upon her at the time of the murder, in the hope of identifying  the murderer; but she had forgotten the whole circumstances of her aunt&rsquo;s  death, and yet she suffered agonies from a vague terror associated in her  enfeebled mind with the very name of that aunt.</p>
<p>As soon as she was well enough to travel she was  taken to the Ursuline convent at Dinan by a good priest who had befriended her  grandmother for many years. After this transference to the convent the police  lost sight of the child Lemarque.</p>
<p>Throughout the evening, even amidst the  distractions of a finely acted comedy by Augier, and in the wakeful intervals  of a somewhat disturbed night, Edward Heathcote brooded over the details of the  evidence which he had read, not once, but several times, before he closed the  volume of reports.</p>
<p>The detective instinct, which is a characteristic  of every well-trained lawyer&rsquo;s mind, had been suddenly developed into almost a  passion. He no longer limited his desire to the unravelling of the web of  L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s fate; he ardently longed to discover the mystery of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s murder &mdash; to succeed where one of the most accomplished Parisian  detectives had ignominiously failed. His eagerness to hear more about  Drubarde&rsquo;s efforts and failures in this particular case led him to the Quai des  Grands Augustins at an early hour, in time to surprise the worthy F&eacute;lix in the  act of breakfasting temperately upon <em>caf&eacute;  au lait</em> and boiled eggs.</p>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde gave his new friend a cheery  welcome. It was a lovely morning, balmy as midsummer, and the little garden on  the leads was bright with gaily-coloured asters, nasturtiums, and geraniums,  and agreeably perfumed with mignonette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you perceive the exquisite odours?&rdquo; asked  Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your mignonette is delicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mignonette!&rdquo; cried the police-officer  scornfully. &ldquo;Why, when the wind blows straight from the flower-market, as it  does to-day, I can sit in my garden and enjoy all the perfumes of the Riviera.  I can revel in orange-blossoms, drink my fill of tube-roses and stephanotis,  Mar&eacute;chal Niel and Jacqueline roses. And look what a view! Not a touch of the sculptor&rsquo;s  chisel that I cannot see yonder on the old kings of Notre Dame; not a cornice  or a column in the new hospital that does not stand clear in the morning light!  And yet Paris is peopled with fools who do not make gardens on their  housetops!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps every landlord would not be so complaisant  as yours, Monsieur Drubarde, nor every housetop so adapted to horticulture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True, your Parisian landlord is a churl and a  niggard, and a good many of our housetops are no doubt impracticable. But the  inventive mind, the love of the beautiful, is more often wanting. I see you  have been good enough to bring back my volume. You have read the report, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every line, every syllable, three times over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are interested?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deeply. I was never more intensely interested in  any case that has come within my knowledge: yet as a lawyer I have become  acquainted with many strange stories. Yes, I am more interested than I can say  in the fate of that unhappy actress, in the character of her mysterious lover:  and yet I doubt if this former crime has any bearing upon the murder of L&eacute;onie  Lemarque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would certainly be going somewhat far to  suppose a link between the death of a girl travelling alone in Cornwall &mdash; a  death which may after all have been accidental &mdash; and the murder of her aunt ten  years before in the forest of Saint-Germain. However, it is only by the  minutest scrutiny of L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s past life that you can arrive at the motive which  took her to England, and discover whether she had an enemy in that country &mdash;  that is to say, if she was lured across the Channel in order to be made away  with by that enemy. A very wild and far-fetched supposition I think you will  admit, Monsieur, and one which our talented friend Mr. Distin would not  entertain for five minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professional acumen like Mr. Distin&rsquo;s is apt to  run in grooves &mdash; to be too intent upon following the practical and the  possible, to shut out the romantic element, to strangle the imagination, and to  forget that it is very often by following the apparently impossible that we  arrive at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you are an enthusiast, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never tried to subjugate my imagination. As  a lawyer I found ideality the most useful faculty of my brain. Now, I have been  thinking about L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s fate from every possible point of view, from  the standpoint of imagination as well as from the standpoint of common sense;  and it has occurred to me that if the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol were living, he  would be L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s natural enemy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she was the only witness of his crime. She  alone would have the power to identify him as the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget that it is just that power which the  poor girl lost during her illness. The fever deprived her of memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That effect of the fever may not have been  permanent. The agitation which she showed at the mention of her aunt&rsquo;s name &mdash;  when Sister Gudule questioned her about the silk handkerchief given to her by  Marie Pr&eacute;vol &mdash; would indicate that memory was not a blank. And again, if she  had forgotten the person of the murderer, or even the fact of the murder, he  would not know that, and would regard her existence as a source of danger to  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>F&eacute;lix Drubarde smiled the superior smile of  experience reproving folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you think that after having allowed this one  witness of his crime to exist unmolested for ten years, the assassin all at  once took it into his head to murder her; that with this view he carried her to  your barbarous province of Cornuailles, and there flung her over an embankment.  I am tempted to paraphrase the Scripture, Monsieur, and to exclaim, &lsquo;Are there  not viaducts and embankments in this vast France of ours, that a man should go  to the remote west of your little England in order to commit murder in that  particular fashion!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote felt that the police-officer had the best  of the argument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I grant that it would have been a clumsy method of  getting rid of the girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but murder has been clumsily done before  to-day, and imagination can conceive no crime so improbable as not to be  paralleled by fact. However, it is perhaps too soon to speculate that the  murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol was also the murderer of L&eacute;onie Lemarque. What we have  to do is to find out the reason of the girl&rsquo;s journey to England. But before we  set about that task, I should like you to tell me what steps you took in your  endeavour to trace the murderer after the examination before the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked over the case in my note-book last night,  as I was prepared for you to ask for those details,&rdquo; replied Drubarde. &ldquo;It was  a case that interested me profoundly, all the more so, perhaps, because I made  so little headway in my investigations. My first endeavour was to trace the  murderer&rsquo;s proceedings immediately after the crime. He must have made his escape  from Saint-Germain somehow, unless he had killed himself in some obscure corner  of the wood. Even then the finding of the body would have been a question of so  many days, weeks, or months. Alive, it would have been impossible for him to  remain in hiding in the forest for a week, as the wood was searched thoroughly  during the three days immediately succeeding the murder. On the third day a hat  was found in a boggy bit of ground, ever so far from the scene of the crime.  The hat was a gentleman&rsquo;s hat, but it had been lying three days and nights in a  bog. It had been rained upon for two days out of the three &mdash; there was no  maker&rsquo;s name &mdash; no indication by which the owner of the hat could be traced.  That it had been found so far off seemed to me to prove that the murderer had  been roaming the wood in a wild and disordered frame of mind, and walking at a  tremendous pace, or he could never have got over the distance between the time  when he was seen by the waiter at the Henri Quatre, to turn the corner of the  terrace, and the period of the murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe, then, that the man seen by the waiter  was actually the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt of it. That spasmodic walk, that  hesitancy, the looking back, and then hurrying on &mdash; all these indicated a mind  engaged upon some agitating theme. The man was seen watching the window inside  which Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her admirer were seated. He moved away when he saw  himself observed. He had disguised himself as much as he could by turning up  the collar of his coat; and who can doubt that this was the same man who had  been seen by L&eacute;onie in the railway-station, watching Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her lover  from behind the door of the waiting-room? The dark spectacles were part of a  disguise. These are all details that point to one conclusion. The finding of  the hat induced me to visit every shop in Saint-Germain where a hat could be  bought. It was clear that the murderer could not have gone far from the forest  bare-headed, without attracting attention. He must have procured a hat somehow;  and it was not long before I ascertained that a hat had been bought late on  that very evening. At a shop in an out-of-the-way corner of the town I was told  that a boy, a <em>gamin</em>, had come in on  the night of the murder, and had asked for a cloth travelling-cap. He had  chosen one with flaps to protect the ears, a form of cap intended to give the  utmost protection from cold. He paid for his purchase with a napoleon, and  seemed in a great hurry to be gone, not even stopping to count his change. The  shopkeeper had wondered at such a little ragamuffin being intrusted with a  purchase of the kind. The man had been on the point of closing his shop, and  therefore was quite positive as to the hour. It was his invariable habit to put  up his shutters at nine o&rsquo;clock, and the clock was striking as the boy came to  the door of the shop, breathless and heated, as if he had been running for some  distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you conclude that this travelling-cap was  bought for the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear the sequel, and judge for yourself. I went  from the hatter&rsquo;s to the railway-station, and there, after having been bandied  about from pillar to post, I succeeded in finding a tolerably intelligent  official who remembered the night of the murder &mdash; now ten days past &mdash; and who  could recall most of the passengers who had left for Paris by the half-past  nine o&rsquo;clock train upon that particular night. The news of the murder had not  been brought to the station before the starting of the train: a most criminal  neglect on the part of the local police. No suspicious-looking person had been  observed to enter the train; but upon my questioning him closely, the man  remembered having noticed a traveller who wore a cloth cap with flaps over the  ears &mdash; a seemingly needless protection upon a mild September evening. &lsquo;There is  one who takes care of himself,&rsquo; the railway official had thought. For the rest,  this passenger had looked like a gentleman, tall, erect, well-built, a bigger  man than the majority of Frenchmen &mdash; what the railway official permitted  himself to call <em>un bel homme</em>. Had he  appeared agitated, breathless, in a hurry? No, the official had noticed nothing  extraordinary in his manner. He wore smoke-coloured spectacles, which concealed  the expression of his eyes. He had a return-ticket for Paris. The train was  scarcely out of the station when the police came to make inquiries. The murder  had been known of at the police-station at a quarter past eight, and it was not  until after half-past nine that the police thought of setting a watch upon the  railway-station. That is how your rustic police favour the escape of a  criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you trace your gentleman in the cloth cap any  further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not an inch. No one had observed him at  Saint-Lazare, nor at any intermediate station where the train stopped. I  wearied myself during the next six weeks in the endeavour to trace the man  called Georges, who must have had some local habitation in Paris besides Marie  Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s apartment. In vain. In no quarter of Paris could I hear of any  apartment occupied by a man answering to the description of this man who called  himself Georges &mdash; rich, independent, handsome, in the prime of life. I could  trace no such man among the prosperous classes of Paris, and my machinery for  tracking any individual in the wilderness of this great city had hitherto proved  almost infallible. This man baffled me. I &lsquo;touched on him&rsquo; now and again, as  you English say of your hunted fox, but I could never get upon a scent strong  enough to follow; and in the end I gave up all hope of finding him. He must  have sneaked out of France under the very noses of the police; for I had set a  watch upon every probable exit from this country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt he was clever enough to choose the most  improbable point of departure. Did you see much of Madame Lemarque after the  murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. My interest in her ceased when I gave up the  case as hopeless. I had fresh cases &mdash; new interests; and the murder of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol remained in my mind only as a tradition, until you recalled the story of  the crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I telegraphed yesterday to the principal of the  Ursuline convent at Dinan,&rdquo; said Mr. Heathcote, &ldquo;and I have obtained from her  the address at which Madame Lemarque was living two years ago, when her niece  was sent back to Paris in company with other pupils. After leaving you I shall  go to that address, and try to find Madame Lemarque. I may have the painful  duty of informing her of her granddaughter&rsquo;s death; and yet I can but think  that were the grandmother still living she must have heard of the girl&rsquo;s death,  and would have communicated with the Cornish police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to suppose her more intelligent than the  average Frenchwoman,&rdquo; said Drubarde, as if he belonged to another nation.  &ldquo;Suppose I accompany you in your search for Madame Lemarque? That ought to be  interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted to secure your aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monsieur Drubarde and his guest descended the  ladder. The detective put on a gray overcoat, which concealed and subjugated  the airiness of his summer attire. He put on the hat of sober commonplace  existence, and contrived to give himself an almost patriarchal aspect before he  left his lodging.</p>
<p>The street in which Madame Lemarque had been living  when the nuns of Dinan last heard of her was a narrow and shabby little street  between Saint-Sulpice and the Luxembourg. The house was decently kept, and had  a respectable air, and was evidently not one of those caravanserais where  lodgers come and go with every term. It had a settled sober appearance, and the  brass plates upon the door told of permanent residents with reputable  avocations. One of these plates informed society that Mesdames Lemarque and  Beauville, <em>Robes et Modes</em>, occupied  the third floor. The staircase was clean and quiet, and the first sound that  saluted Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s ears as he went up-stairs was the screech of a parrot,  which became momentarily louder as the visitors approached the third floor.</p>
<p>On the door on the left of the landing appeared  another brass plate &mdash; Mesdames Lemarque et Beauville, Robes, Modes, Chapeaux.</p>
<p>Heathcote rang the bell. He felt curiously agitated  at the thought that in the next minute he might be face to face with the dead  girl&rsquo;s grandmother.</p>
<p>The door was opened by an elderly woman in black,  very sallow, very thin, with prominent cheekbones and hungry black eyes. She  was neatly clad, her rusty silk gown fitting her fleshless form to perfection,  her linen collar and cuffs spotlessly clean, her iron-gray hair carefully  arranged; but poverty was stamped upon every fold of her gown, and written in  every line upon her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Lemarque?&rdquo; inquired Heathcote, while the <em>ci-devant</em> police-officer looked over his  shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not Madame Lemarque, but I am her  business representative. Any orders intended for Madame Lemarque can be  executed by me. I am Mademoiselle Beauville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Mademoiselle, it is not a question of  orders,&rdquo; replied Heathcote, in his most courteous tones. &ldquo;I have come on a  painful errand. I have to impart very sad news to Madame Lemarque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madame Beauville sighed and shrugged her thin  shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Lemarque is taking her rest in a place  where all the events of this earth are alike indifferent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Take the  trouble to enter my humble apartment, gentlemen. Madame Lemarque was my partner  and my friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote and his companion followed the dressmaker  into her little <em>salon</em>, where a  dilapidated old gray cockatoo was clambering upon a perch, seemingly in danger  of doing himself to death head downwards at every other minute. The <em>salon</em> was like the appearance of  Mademoiselle Beauville, scrupulously neat, painfully pinched and spare. A poor  little old-fashioned walnut table, polished to desperation, a cheap little  china vase of common flowers, a carpet which covered only a small island in an  ocean of red tiles, an old mahogany secr&eacute;taire with materials for writing, and  by way of decoration the fashion-plates of <em>Le  Follet</em> neatly pinned against the dingy wall-paper. There was a work-basket  on the table, and Mademoiselle Beauville had apparently been busily remaking a  very old gown of her own, in order to keep her hand in during the dead season.</p>
<p>Heathcote discovered later that Mademoiselle  Beauville cherished one bitter and unappeasable hatred, and that was against  Messrs. Spricht, Van Klopen, and the whole confraternity of men-milliners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Madame Lemarque is dead, I apprehend,  Mademoiselle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame Lemarque died last June.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she had been ailing for some time. But the end  came more quickly than she expected. My poor friend had but a short time in  which to arrange her affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was her granddaughter L&eacute;onie living with her at  the time of her death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was. But what do you know about L&eacute;onie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ex-detective laid his hand hastily upon  Heathcote&rsquo;s wrist before he could answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer nothing until we have heard what she can  tell us,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very little about her, but I am anxious to  know more; and if you should be a loser by the waste of your time in answering  my inquiries, I shall be most happy to recompense you for that loss,&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>The spinster&rsquo;s hungry eyes sparkled. Decent poverty  has depths unknown to the professed pauper. Mademoiselle&rsquo;s larder would have  exhibited a touching spectacle to the eye of the philosopher or physiologist.  The philosopher would have wondered that woman can endure privation with such  patience: the physiologist would have been surprised that humanity can sustain  life upon so little. For weeks past Mademoiselle Beauville&rsquo;s most luxurious  idea of dinner had been an egg. For the last week her daily ration had been two  halfpenny rolls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all you can about your friend and her  grandchild,&rdquo; asked Heathcote eagerly. &ldquo;I am particularly interested in knowing  everything; but as it is dry work talking, and as neither my friend nor I have  lunched, it might be a good idea to get a bottle of Bordeaux and a few  biscuits, if Mademoiselle will permit us to refresh ourselves in her  apartment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His keen glance had noted the hollow cheeks and  glittering eyes of the dressmaker, and he wanted an excuse for giving life and  warmth to that impoverished form. Drubarde caught at the idea, thinking that  his client&rsquo;s design was to loosen the lady&rsquo;s tongue by the agency of Bacchus.  It was altogether an amateur&rsquo;s notion, crude, wanting in subtlety; but the  genial Drubarde was willing to indulge a beginner who was feeling his way in  the elements of a great art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch a bottle of wine myself,&rdquo; he said  cheerily; &ldquo;I know where I can get one close by, and of the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring two,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Mademoiselle will  accept the second bottle by way of souvenir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, do you wish to make me a drunkard? I  have not tasted wine since my poor friend&rsquo;s death,&rdquo; protested Mademoiselle  Beauville, but there was a look in her face which told Heathcote that his gift  would not be unwelcome.</p>
<p>Drubarde ran down-stairs like a boy, and was back  in five minutes, carrying a couple of sealed bottles, labelled St. Est&egrave;phe, and  a large bag of biscuits.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle had set out a tray in the mean time,  with her poor little stock of glasses, three in all, and one of those cracked,  and an old china plate for the biscuits. Again her eyes glistened when she saw  the ample biscuit-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me look at the name on the bag,&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>Strange, it was the very name upon that biscuit-bag  which he carried at this moment, neatly folded in his pocket-book, the bag  which had been found in the second-class compartment from which the girl fell!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Mademoiselle, tell me all you can about  your deceased friend and her granddaughter. You had known Madame Lemarque for  some time, I conclude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had lived with her for nearly ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For nearly ten years? Then you must have joined  your fortunes with hers very soon after the murder of her daughter, Marie  Pr&eacute;vol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of that terrible event, then,  Monsieur?&rdquo; asked the dressmaker. &ldquo;It is so long since it happened that I  thought it had been forgotten by all the world except me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mademoiselle; a tragedy so terrible as that  can never be forgotten by those who study the physiology of crime. I am keenly  interested in tracing the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ten years!&rdquo; exclaimed Mademoiselle  Beauville, with an incredulous smile. &ldquo;Only a dreamer could think of such a  thing, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I am such a dreamer, Mademoiselle, and I hope  you will help me to realise my dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Monsieur know that Monsieur Mardoche, one of  the most distinguished of our <em>Juges  d&rsquo;Instruction</em>, took up this case with enthusiasm; that the police were  never more earnest than in their endeavour to find poor Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s  murderer? Does Monsieur know that it was a double murder, and that the Baron de  Maucroix, a young man of high family and large fortune, was also a victim? Does  Monsieur suppose that the Baron&rsquo;s friends were idle &mdash; that no inducement was  offered to the police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware of all this, Mademoiselle, and I know  that the cleverest police in the world &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except Russia. We must always bow to the superior  genius of the north,&rdquo; interjected Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware that the police failed. But you must  consider, Mademoiselle, that when the police of Paris were keenest in their  pursuit of the assassin, the assassin was most upon his guard. The  consciousness of his crime, the horror of his position, intensified his  intelligence. He had but one thought &mdash; to escape detection. Every act, every  movement, every word was planned with that purpose. But now ten years have gone  by &mdash; ten years of security. The murderer may be less guarded, more open to  detection. He will have grown careless &mdash; foolhardy even &mdash; believing that after  such an interval detection must be impossible. If Mademoiselle will do me the  honour to touch glasses, we will discuss this question at our leisure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had filled the three glasses, but he had  perceived that the dressmaker had a delicacy in drinking the wine he had  provided, so he took up his glass and offered the edge of it to hers; and,  emboldened by this friendly movement, the spinster clinked her glass against  the rim of his, then against that of the patriarchal Drubarde, while the  cockatoo, wondering at this unwonted revelry, screeched his loudest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To your good health, gentlemen,&rdquo; faltered the  dressmaker, before she sipped her wine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the speedy discovery of Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s  murderer,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know our poor Marie, Monsieur, that you  are thus interested in her dark fate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, if you had but known her, I should understand  your desire to avenge her death. She was so lovely. To know her was to adore  her. Even a soured old maid such as I could but yield to her charm. She was as  loving as she was lovable; a clinging disposition, a poetical nature. Her life  was not blameless, perhaps &mdash; who knows? We will not scrutinise too closely. She  was as different from those harpies whom one hears of in Paris as a wild rose  in the hedge is different from a jewel that has gone the round of every Mont-de-Pi&eacute;t&eacute;  in the city. Her heart was pure as the heart of a child. She had no ambition  but to love and to be loved. The man who absorbed her life for a long time,  whose hand perhaps slew her, was rich, lavish. He would have loaded her with  gifts if she had let him, he would have taken her off the stage and allowed her  to play the fine lady; but to the last she preserved the same modest ideas &mdash;  generous to others, careless of herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever see the man who called himself  Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. He was a man of curious habits. He loved  the night better than the day. Nothing delighted him more than a moonlight  drive in the Bois after midnight, a supper at the Cascade. He patronised the  restaurants that keep open half the night. Marie and he used to sup together at  the Caf&eacute; de Paris, sometimes with one or two chosen friends, but much more  often alone. I was not Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s partner at that time; but I occupied a  room in the roof of this house, and I used to work by the day for Madame and  for Marie. I have spent many days working for her in the Rue de Lafitte. I made  all her gowns, and I was proud that she should challenge comparison with  actresses who squandered their thousands upon such impostors as Spricht and Van  Klopen. Imagine, Monsieur, a man &mdash; a stern rugged nature which can have no true  feeling for the beauty of woman&rsquo;s dress &mdash; a being of angles and hard lines &mdash; a  creature without grace or <em>flou</em>. No  wonder that square shoulders and pointed elbows have come into fashion since  men have dictated the dress of women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle had mounted her hobby, and was riding  furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubtless it is a mistake in art, and one that  must be discovered before long,&rdquo; said Heathcote soothingly. &ldquo;But tell me,  Mademoiselle, in all your visits to the Rue de Lafitte, did you never encounter  Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! And did your friend Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol  talk much of this Monsieur Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she used to talk to me a great deal about him  at one time, poor child: I think she talked even more freely to me than to her mother.  Madame Lemarque was just a little too fond of money, too eager for gifts from  her child, and that wounded Marie&rsquo;s generous nature. &lsquo;You value people only for  what they can give you,&rsquo; she said once to her mother. &lsquo;If Georges were Satan,  you would like him just as well &mdash; provided you got enough of his money.&rsquo; And  then there was a quarrel, as you may suppose, Monsieur. There were excuses to  be made for Madame Lemarque, poor soul. She had been rich once &mdash; an atelier in  the Rue de la Paix &mdash; a country house at Asni&egrave;res &mdash; but these man-milliners had  spoiled her trade, and at this time she was very poor, living in these rooms  which you see, and working for half a dozen shabby customers who ground her to  the dust by their meanness. And then when Marie gave her money she spent it  recklessly &mdash; she ate and drank like a princess &mdash; she took a <em>voiture de place</em>, whenever she went out:  she thought that Marie could never do too much for her or her son&rsquo;s orphan  child L&eacute;onie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie lived with her grandmother, did she not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame Lemarque had kept her since she was  three years old. It was a dull life for a child. She used to sit on a little  stool in that corner, and thread needles for her grandmother. When she was  eight years old she could work very neatly; she ran errands too. She earned her  daily bread, poor child. But her happiest days were those she spent with her  aunt in the Rue Lafitte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol was good to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good to her? Yes, and to every one who came in her  way. I tell you she was a creature made up of sweetness and love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And was she devoted to this Monsieur Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At one time, yes. It was an adoration on both  sides. Marie used to tell me of their journeys in foreign countries, under a  southern sky. Of their happy life, far away from the crowd; of his boundless  love for her, his generosity, his devotion. She had a fever in Venice, and he  nursed her, and watched beside her bed day and night &mdash; thirteen days and  thirteen nights &mdash; till she was out of danger. It was a love such as one reads  of in poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any reason to think that she was his  lawful wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell. His constancy and devotion were  those of the best of husbands. She wore a wedding-ring, and she was always  called by his name when they travelled, as well as in her lodgings. It was  almost at the beginning of their attachment that he took her to England. I have  sometimes thought that they were married in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he introduce her to his friends in Paris?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a few artists and writers whom she used to  meet at supper. They were some of the wildest young men in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he introduced her to no ladies &mdash; to no  families of good standing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt if he could have had any such friends. He  lived too eccentric a life to cultivate what you call respectable acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he himself an artist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. He was too rich for a painter or an  author.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have never heard of him since Marie  Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the jewels and other property which  had belonged to Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were sold by her mother, who lived upon the  proceeds of the sale for some years. She paid for L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s schooling out of the  same fund. It was only in the last years of her life that she again became  poor. But to the very last she had means of her own &mdash; a small income, the  source of which was unknown to me. She might have lived very comfortably if she  had not been extravagant; but she had no prudence, and there were times when  she was almost penniless. She took me into partnership very soon after her  daughter&rsquo;s death. She had sent the little girl to a convent, and she felt  lonely and nervous in these rooms. Her spirits never recovered from the shock  of that terrible murder &mdash; the horror of the night in which L&eacute;onie was brought  home to her by the police from Saint-Germain, who told her the history of the  murder. She invited me to share her apartment, and to work for her, taking half  the profits of the business. The profits were of the smallest, but she gave me  my board and lodging, and I was too fond of Madame Lemarque, and of Jacko,&rdquo;  added the spinster, looking fondly at the cockatoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s parrot, I conclude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He belonged to poor Marie. Ah, he could tell  us a great deal, if he would but talk sense instead of repeating foolish songs.  She bought him from a sailor at Marseilles, and brought him home with her after  one of her autumn holidays. She used to teach him lines from the songs she sang  at the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Moi, je suis  le radis noir!</em>&rdquo; shrieked the parrot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were living with Madame Lemarque when her  granddaughter returned from Dinan, I suppose?&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you seem to know all about it. Yes, I was with  Madame when she went to Saint-Lazare to meet the child. Such a bright, pretty  girl she had grown &mdash; so amiable, and clever, and industrious. I never thought  she would act towards me as she has done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way has she acted badly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went to England directly after her  grandmother&rsquo;s death &mdash; that is more than two months ago &mdash; and she has not  written to me once since then. No doubt she has found powerful friends &mdash; rich  friends &mdash; and has no need of a poor old woman like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be some other reason for her silence,&rdquo;  said Heathcote gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some misfortune; an accident, perhaps. She had to travel  by steamer and by railway. Might not something have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of that sometimes,&rdquo; said the  dressmaker, with a distressed look, &ldquo;and if I had had a friend in England &mdash; one  single friend &mdash; I should have written to ask that friend to make inquiries. But  I have so few friends &mdash; hardly any one in Paris, no one outside Paris,&rdquo; she  concluded dejectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely you knew L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s errand? You knew to  whom she was going? You might have written to that person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing. The girl&rsquo;s errand was a secret  from me. On her death-bed Madame Lemarque gave her granddaughter some  commission. There were letters or papers of some kind, I think, which she was  to take to somebody in England, and that person was expected to befriend her.  The grandmother was very secret about it. She would not speak to L&eacute;onie on the  subject while I was in the room, but on re&euml;ntering rather suddenly I saw some  papers on the bed. I overheard a few words &mdash; something about a friend of  Monsieur Georges, rich, powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was to this friend of Georges, the  murderer, that L&eacute;onie was to appeal for protection and help?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember we are not certain that Georges was the  murderer. It is only a supposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a supposition so well grounded as to be almost  certainty. An adoring lover, who disappears immediately after the murder of his  mistress &mdash; a lover who had good ground for jealousy, and is known to have been  madly jealous, mark you; a murder that could only have been inspired by madness  or by jealousy. If these facts are not strong enough to condemn Monsieur  Georges, what does circumstantial evidence mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to me about it,&rdquo; muttered Drubarde  impatiently. &ldquo;Georges was the murderer. The police were at fault in their  search for him, but they were never in doubt as to his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was to a friend of her daughter&rsquo;s murderer  that Madame Lemarque sent her granddaughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What other resources had she, do you think?&rdquo;  exclaimed the dressmaker. &ldquo;She was dying, penniless, friendless, leaving her  grandchild to the mercy of strangers. She knew that Monsieur Georges was a rich  man, and that any friend of Monsieur Georges was likely to be well off. I  daresay she knew no more than the name of this friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear the name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. I heard her tell L&eacute;onie that the gentleman  was in London. He was living at some hotel, the name of which I forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you recognise it if you heard it?&rdquo; asked  Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps. I am not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went over the names of the principal hotels,  without success. Mademoiselle Beauville could not remember to have heard any  one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure that Mademoiselle Lemarque was to go  to London,&rdquo; inquired Heathcote, &ldquo;and no further than London? You heard no  mention of Cornwall or Plymouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He repeated the names of county and town &mdash; giving  each the true Gallic intonation &mdash; but they suggested nothing to Mademoiselle  Beauville.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was to go to London &mdash; nowhere else. But why do  you ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell you that presently. Did L&eacute;onie  Lemarque leave Paris immediately after her grandmother&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She left the evening after the funeral. She did  not even wait to get a mourning-gown made. She had worn a black gown belonging  to me at the funeral, and she changed it for her gray alpaca gown before she  left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she take no luggage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a change of linen in a handbag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she travel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She went from the Station du Nord at eight  o&rsquo;clock. I walked to the station with her, poor child. We were both very sad,  and very tired. She was to cross from Calais to Dover in the night, and she  would arrive in London early next morning. She promised me to write on the day  of her arrival. I told her that I thought it was a dangerous thing for a young  girl to go alone to meet a stranger, a man whose face she had never seen. She  said her grandmother had told her that he was a good and honourable man, who  had befriended her in her poverty, and she (L&eacute;onie) was to trust him. She  begged me not to ask her any questions. Her grandmother had warned her to say  nothing until after she had arrived in England, when she was to write to me and  tell me of her new home. When I pressed her to give me her confidence, she  began to cry; but I managed to find out that she was going to London with the  idea of being placed in some rich and aristocratic family, where she would be a  companion to the children and teach them her own language. She was not  accomplished enough to be a governess of a superior kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she get the money for her journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her grandmother gave it her on her death-bed; but  as there had been hardly any money in the house for the last week of Madame  Lemarque&rsquo;s illness, I concluded that this money had been sent from the person  in England in reply to an application from Madame Lemarque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you post any letter addressed to England  during your friend&rsquo;s illness?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not; but L&eacute;onie may have done so. She went  out every day upon some errand or other. And now, Monsieur, pray tell me how  you came to know all about L&eacute;onie, and if you have any bad news for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, Mademoiselle, I have the worst possible  news. Your young friend is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! And there was no one to tell me. The  gentleman who was to befriend her, to whom she went as to a protector and  benefactor, he did not even take the trouble to tell me her fate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may never have found him, poor child. She may  have been lured away from her destination and from London by a villain. She met  her death more than two hundred miles from London. She fell from a  railway-bridge, and was killed instantly; but whether that death was an  accident or a murder, no one yet knows, except the Great Judge of all human  actions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe it was &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder. I am here to discover the motive of that  crime.&rdquo;</p>

  A Student Of Men And Women</h2>
<p>There was a silence of some minutes, during which  Mademoiselle Beauville wept quietly. And then Heathcote and the  ex-police-officer rose to take leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you sincerely, Mademoiselle, for having  given me all the information in your power to give, and I must beg you to  accept some small compensation for the time I have wasted,&rdquo; said Mr. Heathcote,  slipping a couple of twenty-franc pieces into the dressmaker&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>The lonely spinster&rsquo;s eyes shone with a feverish  light as her skinny fingers closed upon the gold. It was like manna dropped  from heaven. Long and weary weeks had passed since her <em>robes et modes</em> had brought her so much money. Her chief customers  of late had been the grisettes of the quarter, who had dribbled out their  payments by two or three francs at a time, and who had exacted the maximum of  labour for the minimum of pay. Mademoiselle&rsquo;s hollow cheeks were flushed with  the warm red wine, her heart glowed with the thought that she could now pay her  last term to the Harpagon landlord &mdash; not much worse, perhaps, than the rest of  his species, but all landlords seem Harpagons when they claim their due from  the needy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is too good, too generous,&rdquo; murmured the  seamstress; &ldquo;I should refuse all remuneration, only work has been so slack of  late &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one word, Mademoiselle. Stay, I have one more  question, and that an important one, to ask before I take my leave. Can you  give me the exact date upon which L&eacute;onie Lemarque left Paris for Dover?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly, Monsieur. It was on the 4th of July.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The 4th! And it was on the evening of the 5th she  met with her death. You say she carried a small handbag containing linen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Her clothes were of the fewest, dear child;  but everything she had was neat and nice of its kind. She had a change of linen  with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had she nothing else in the bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. I went into the room while she was  packing, and I saw her take a small sealed packet from under her pillow, and  put it in her bosom. I had seen the same packet under her grandmother&rsquo;s pillow  before she died. It looked like a parcel of letters or papers of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what station L&eacute;onie was to arrive at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was the terminus of Charing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charing Cross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. It was a double name like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Adieu, Mademoiselle. My friend and I may  come to you again perhaps to make further inquiries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be very welcome, Monsieur. And if you  discover the secret of my poor young friend&rsquo;s fate, you will tell me &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word, Monsieur. Where is our little L&eacute;onie  buried? Has she a decent grave in your English land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She lies in a rustic churchyard under a great  yew-tree. There is a stone upon her grave, with a brief record of when and how  she met her death. Her name and age shall now be added to the inscription.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Monsieur! But what kind friend was it who  placed a stone over the grave of a nameless stranger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my care. It was a very small thing to  do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur, it is in doing these small things  that a great heart shows itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote and his companion made their adieux,  accompanied to the landing by the spinster, who felt as if she had entertained  angels unawares; but when the sound of their footsteps had died away upon the  stairs she went back to her room, and wept over the fate of her young friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have nothing left in this world to love but  you,&rdquo; she said, piteously addressing the cockatoo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;J&rsquo;ai bien des chos&rsquo;s au Mont-d&rsquo;-Pi&eacute;t&eacute;,&rdquo; replied  the bird.</p>
<p>It was one o&rsquo;clock by the time Mr. Heathcote and  Monsieur Drubarde left the dressmaker&rsquo;s apartment, so the Englishman suggested  a light luncheon at the Restaurant Lap&eacute;rouse, within a stone&rsquo;s throw of  Drubarde&rsquo;s apartment; and the suggestion being received favourably by the  ex-policeman, they were soon afterwards seated at a little table, in a private  room with a window overlooking the river, ready to do justice to the <em>plat du jour</em>, a <em>fricandeau aux &eacute;pinards</em>, and to a bottle of <em>Mouton-Rothschild</em>. The wine-bibbing at the dressmaker&rsquo;s apartment  had been merely a benevolent excuse for providing the spinster with a little  good Bordeaux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Monsieur Drubarde, we are alone and at our  ease. You have now all the facts of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s death well within your  knowledge; and it is for you to give me your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very difficult case in which to come to a  decided opinion,&rdquo; answered Drubarde. &ldquo;At present my conclusions and yours are  antagonistic. My niece wrote out a careful translation of your newspaper  report. I have her translation in my pocket-book. You can look it over if you  like, to see that it is faithfully done. I have read it three or four times,  with keenest attention, and I can so far see nothing out of the common in  L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s fate. A pretty girl travelling alone, a common ruffian, a  common murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you see no link between this crime and that  former murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thread &mdash; not a hair. A deed done ten years  ago &mdash; unpunished, the murderer undiscovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you forget that L&eacute;onie went to London with  credentials to a friend of this very murderer? Perhaps a friend so devoted, so  bound to the guilty man, that he might not stop at murder to get rid of the one  witness of his friend&rsquo;s crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To imagine that is to imagine an impossible  friendship. Men do not risk their necks nowadays, whatever they may have done  in the time of Damon and Pythias.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you see nothing extraordinary or mysterious  in the violent death of this girl, within twenty-four hours of her leaving  Paris, carrying with her documents which may, in some manner, have betrayed the  secret of the double murder. Perhaps a letter from the lover to his mistress, a  letter written by a man maddened by jealousy, threatening to do the deed which  was afterwards done. You see no sufficient ground for connecting one crime with  the other, for seeking the secret of the second crime in the history of the  first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honestly, I do not,&rdquo; replied Drubarde, who had  fastened his napkin under his chin, had nibbled a radish or two, and destroyed  the symmetry of a dish of prawns, by way of preparation for the <em>fricandeau</em>. &ldquo;I only wish I could see my  way to such an opinion. It would make as pretty a complication as ever I was  concerned in. However, there is no knowing what new discoveries we may hit  upon, if we go to work patiently. My present view of the case is that L&eacute;onie  Lemarque, being young, silly, and inexperienced, and not knowing a word of  English, altogether a wrong person to attempt such a journey alone, got into  bad hands at the very beginning. I believe that, instead of meeting this person  who was to have befriended her, and who must have been a man of standing and  respectability, or the old grandmother would not have sent her to him, she fell  into the hands of a scoundrel, and was lured into your train for Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember that Paddington Station is some  miles from Charing Cross,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;The girl could not be smuggled from  one train to the other unawares. She must have traversed half London on foot,  or in a conveyance of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly. But, as likely as not, she was in the  companionship of the wrong man. Consider her ignorance, her helplessness. What  an easy prey for a villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote was unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine a crime so motiveless as that  which you suggest,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>He began to lose faith in the old sleuthhound. He  began to think that F&eacute;lix Drubarde was worn-out; that scent, and pace, and  tongue were things of the past. He began to think that the work of finding the  link between the two crimes must be done by himself rather than by Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of the girl&rsquo;s bag?&rdquo; asked Drubarde,  after he had eaten a liberal portion of veal and spinach. &ldquo;There is no mention  of a bag in your newspaper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no bag found. If there had been, the  victim might have been identified earlier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sealed packet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no packet. There was nothing but a  little basket containing a few cherries and a biscuit-bag. There was no clue to  identity. The murderer had done his work well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing you can do is to put Mr. Distin in  possession of the details you heard from Mademoiselle Beauville. He can make  inquiries at the Charing Cross Station, where it is just possible the girl may  be remembered by some of the porters. A girl travelling alone, and meeting a  gentleman on the platform. The meeting may have been observed even there, where  hundreds meet and part every hour. Railway officials are observant and  keen-witted. It is within the limits of the possible that this poor girl may  not have passed altogether unremarked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write to Distin this afternoon,&rdquo; said  Heathcote. &ldquo;And there is another thing I can do. If your theory is correct,  L&eacute;onie Lemarque missed the person who was to have met her at the station, and  fell into bad hands. If that is so, the fact ought to be arrived at easily by  an appeal to the person whom she should have met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took out his pencil and pocket-book, and wrote  the rough draft of an advertisement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who was to have met L&eacute;onie Lemarque at  Charing Cross Station on the morning of July 5th last is earnestly requested to  communicate immediately with Messrs. Distin &amp; Son, Solicitors, Furnival&rsquo;s  Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He translated this advertisement to Monsieur  Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that is a wise test,&rdquo; said the  police-officer. &ldquo;I see you have the true <em>flair</em>.  If the man is innocent, he will answer that advertisement &mdash; always supposing  that it come to his knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will repeat it so often in the <em>Times</em> that it will not be easy for the  appeal to escape him,&rdquo; answered Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if there is no sign, we shall say guilty,&rdquo;  said Drubarde.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in that case we have to find the villain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may add a postscript to your letter to  Monsieur Distin, advising him to inquire at the cloak-room of Charing Cross  Station for an unclaimed handbag left there on July 5th. Something must have  been done with that handbag, and, in our civilised condition, it is not easy to  get rid of even a handbag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After having made this suggestion, Monsieur  Drubarde devoted himself entirely to the pleasures of the table. Heathcote ate  very little, and was too troubled in mind to know what he ate. He saw himself  no nearer a solution of the problem which he had pledged himself to solve. Yet  this he felt, that the sky was growing clearer round Bothwell Grahame. The  secret of the girl&rsquo;s death seemed to lie between the man whom she was to have  met at Charing Cross and the phenomenal villain of Drubarde&rsquo;s imagination, who  had lured her into the Cornish train with darkest intent.</p>
<p>He left F&eacute;lix Drubarde directly after luncheon, and  walked back to the H&ocirc;tel de Bade, where he devoted the afternoon to his  correspondence. He wrote at fullest length to Joseph Distin, enclosing the  advertisement for the <em>Times</em>, with a  cheque, and an order for its daily appearance until further notice. He wrote a  cheery letter to Hilda, telling her to be hopeful; and he wrote to Mrs.  Wyllard, telling her that the result of his investigations up to the present  hour had gone far to dispel his suspicion of her cousin&rsquo;s guilt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am still groping in the dark,&rdquo; he concluded,  &ldquo;and am very far from having achieved any tangible result; but I am working  with all my mind and all my strength, and I hope that Providence will not  compel me to abandon my task until I have fathomed the mystery of L&eacute;onie  Lemarque&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote thus, unconsciously forgetting that Dora  Wyllard did not know even the name of the victim. The discovery of the girl&rsquo;s  identity, made three days ago, at Dinan, seemed, to him an old history, so  exclusively had his mind dwelt upon this one subject since his interview with  the nuns. The fact that the name must be a new thing to Dora never struck him.</p>
<p>He dined alone in his private sitting-room, he who  at any other time would have enjoyed the glitter and life of the Boulevard in  all its evening brilliancy. He wanted to be free from all sound and movement,  from the sight of strange faces, so that his mind should work undisturbed upon  the problem he had set himself to solve.</p>
<p>And now over his solitary cutlet, with his  pocket-book open before him, he marshalled his facts, and reflected upon each  detail of the story.</p>
<p>The murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and Maxime de Maucroix  had escaped, and in all probability was still living. He appeared to have been  rich, independent of all ties, a Bohemian in his habits, a man who could live  in any country. Hardly possible that such a man would remain within a narrow  radius of the scene of his crime. He was not to be looked for assuredly in  Paris, or even in France. It was far more likely that he had crossed the  Atlantic, and sunk his identity in that wider, freer society of the United  States, where money and cleverness outweigh a man&rsquo;s antecedents, where no one  asks what a man has been, only what he is, or is worth in the present. Or it  might be that such a man as this Georges &mdash; a night-bird, a man of fervid  temperament, a lover of pleasure rather than work, unambitious, a voluptuary &mdash;  would turn his face to Southern America, and dream away the after stages of an  exhausted life in some romantic city upon the Seaboard of the Pacific. Not in  Europe &mdash; or not in the accessible quarters of Europe &mdash; should he be sought for.</p>
<p>But in the mean time, here in this city of Paris,  there was something to be done. Vain to look for the man himself, perhaps; but  those who had known the man &mdash; his chosen friends, the companions of his  midnight orgies &mdash; might still be found. From them the man&rsquo;s antecedents might  be learned; and possibly some glimmer of light could be obtained as to his  adventures and whereabouts after the murder.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote reviewed his Parisian acquaintance  in search of such men as might be likely to have known this Monsieur Georges.  It was almost impossible for a man, spending his money lavishly, the favoured  admirer of a beautiful actress, not to be in some measure a man of mark, and  widely known in the faster section of Parisian society.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote knew his Paris well, and loved it  well. After that bitter loss which had changed the current of his life, he had  found hard work in his office his best cure, and next best to hard mental  labour he had found relief of mind in the society of the artistic and  keen-witted idlers of the Boulevard and the Bohemian clubs. He had found a week  in Paris &mdash; a week of Boulevard idleness and Boulevard society &mdash; the best remedy  for the dulness and the depression that come from an unsatisfied heart and an  overworked brain: and in these occasional plunges into Parisian society he had  made a wider acquaintance with the artistic classes than it is often granted to  a provincial Englishman to make.</p>
<p>He ran over the names of the men he knew best in  Paris, trying to hit upon the likeliest person to suit his purpose. It must be  a man who had been well to the fore ten years ago, when Marie Pr&eacute;vol was a  famous beauty, and her lover was spending his nights and his fortune on the  Boulevard. It should not be difficult, he thought, to hit upon such a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Volney Dugarge, Bize, Pontruche, Trottier. Yes,  Trottier. That is the man; a thorough-going Bohemian, a haunter of  supper-tables and gambling-dens, a hanger-on of lorettes, steeped to the tips  of his nails in the atmosphere of the <em>demi-monde</em>,  a man who had known Gautier and Nerval and Gustave Planche, an <em>habitu&eacute;</em> of the Boulevard theatres; poor,  keen-witted, a member of the band of paragraphists, the men who invent  scandals, political, social, literary, theatrical, according to the prevailing  demand, who write smart paragraphs for the most audacious of the newspapers, and  puffs for enterprising tradesmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Trottier, thus humble in his pursuits, a man  utterly without pride, or, as his enemies said, without self-respect, was one  of the most agreeable men in Paris. He had been a Boulevardier for the last  thirty years, had seen the Boulevard extend its glittering length into regions  which he had known as a wilderness of gloom and poverty. He remembered the time  when the Palais Royal was the focus of Parisian gaiety, the temple of fashion  and taste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this man Georges had any status in Bohemian  society, Sigismond Trottier must have known him,&rdquo; thought Heathcote.</p>
<p>The next thing was to find Trottier. He was a man  who only began to live after dinner. He might be looked for on the Boulevard  between nine o&rsquo;clock and midnight. He might be found at a club much favoured by  actors and journalists, a club which had taken for itself a name from the  history of the medi&aelig;val drama, and rejoiced in the title of <em>Les Enfants Sans Souci</em>, more briefly  known as the <em>Sans Souci</em>. The <em>Sans Souci</em> had its nest on an <em>entresol</em> in the Rue Vivienne, six  low-ceiled rooms opening one out of another, three of them furnished with  divans in true Oriental style. These were the smoking-rooms. Then came a fourth  and much more spacious apartment, provided with numerous small tables, writing  materials, and the newspapers. Tapestried <em>porti&egrave;res</em> on the right and left of the fireplace in this reading-room opened into the  sanctuary of the club, two medium-sized rooms, furnished with green cloth  tables for baccarat, thickly curtained, thickly carpeted, lighted only from the  courtyard of the house, which was like a dry well.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote strolled along the Boulevard,  looking for his friend as he went. It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock, a delicious  night, balmy, starlit, summer-like; a night upon which Sigismond Trottier might  naturally have been found seated amidst the idlers clustered on the asphalte in  front of a popular caf&eacute;. But in the groups which Heathcote passed between the  H&ocirc;tel de Bade and the corner of the Place de la Bourse there was no sign of  Trottier&rsquo;s ferret-face and long gray hair. So the Englishman continued his walk  to the Rue Vivienne, and entered the lamp-lit vestibule which led to the  mysteries of the <em>Sans Souci</em>.</p>
<p>He had been taken there more than once by Trottier,  and had been amused and interested by the people he met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if Monsieur Trottier is here this  evening?&rdquo; he asked of the porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur. He came half an hour ago. Monsieur  Trottier generally comes here at the same hour every evening to write his  article for the <em>Taon</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rooms were almost empty. Neither journalists  nor actors mustered strong before midnight. In a comfortable corner of the  writing-room, at a little table brilliantly lighted by a green-shaded lamp,  Edward Heathcote found the man he came to seek.</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier was at least sixty years of age,  tall, spare to attenuation, with a long narrow face of almost livid pallor, and  long gray hair, falling over a greasy olive-green velvet collar, choice  ornament of a threadbare and faded olive-green frock-coat. His jaw was narrow  and projecting, his lips were thin and pinched, his nose was long and sharp,  his eyebrows were gray and shaggy. The only features that gave life or colour  to the face were the restless and brilliant black eyes, small, keen, observant,  the eyes of a creature always on the watch. Ah, how many of the darkest  mysteries of Paris had that keen glance discovered, how many a loathsome depth  had that ruthless gaze explored, how many a social ulcer, how many a domestic  disease, how many a wound of heart and honour, how many an atrophy of purse and  reputation had those eyes pierced and scrutinised, while all the rest of the  world was still blind to the coming ruin, the inevitable disgrace! Sigismond  Trottier was a student of society. It was his boast that he knew this Paris of  the Third Republic as well as Saint-Simon knew the Paris of the great Louis;  knew it in all its strength; and in all its weakness; knew it to the core of  its rotten heart.</p>
<p>Needless to say that such a man was invaluable as a  paragraphist. He had the same keen scent for a scandal that the well-trained  detective has for a crime. A whisper, a shrug was enough to put him on the  right track. He was a genius at that modern style of hint and innuendo which  just stops short of libel. He had killed more reputations than any man in  Paris: and he had never been to prison. His safety lay in the keenness of his  perception, which never allowed him to fall into such mistakes as have ruined  other society gossips. Whatever Sigismond Trottier wrote was true. He had an  extraordinary power of winnowing the chaff from the corn in the floating  scandals of the Boulevard. He knew what to accept and what to reject. His  judgment was infallible. When Parisian society saw the hint of an elopement,  the suggestion of a marital wrong signed by Sigismond&rsquo;s hieroglyphic &mdash; an  Egyptian beetle &mdash; the thing was received as a fact. The pen of the unerring  recorder had proclaimed a truth. Happily he was not a physical coward, though a  professional assailant of man&rsquo;s honour and woman&rsquo;s reputation. He had given  good proof of his courage on several occasions, had stood up before famous  swordsmen, had faced marksmen of repute. That deep dint in his lean and livid  cheek was the mark of a bullet from the Duke of Midlothian&rsquo;s pistol &mdash; that  famous <em>viveur</em> who expired suddenly  amidst the fading flowers and flaring tapers of a Boulevard supper-room &mdash; the  very spirit of profligate pleasure extinguished in a breath. That long slanting  scar upon the left jaw, a shade more livid than the normal lividity of the  complexion, was the result of five minutes&rsquo; sword-play between the Boulevard  chronicler and the Marquis du Bois-Chaufonds, the reminiscence of a duel which  set all Paris talking twenty years ago, when the Walewska was in the zenith of  her charms. From scalp to sole the paragraphist could have shown the scars of  past battles. He had never been known to refuse a challenge.</p>
<p>Trottier was so absorbed in his task when Heathcote  approached his table as to be quite unconscious of any one&rsquo;s presence.  Heathcote seated himself upon the other side of the table, and took up a  newspaper, to wait till the journalist came to the end of a sheet.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. Before he had read more  than half a dozen paragraphs in the <em>Taon</em>,  each signed with the familiar beetle, Sigismond paused to blot a page, looked  up, and recognised his English acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-evening,&rdquo; he said. Then, with a mighty  effort, he burst into English, and exclaimed, &ldquo;&lsquo;Owderyoudo?&rdquo; all as one word,  having achieved which feat he laughed long and loud, surprised at his own  talent for foreign tongues. &ldquo;We begin to talk your language of horses, we  others,&rdquo; he said triumphantly. &ldquo;We have taken all your words for the sport, and  now we begin to take your greetings and salutations, your shake-hand, your  &lsquo;owderyoudo. And what brings you to Paris, Monsieur Effcott, at the dead  season?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather ask what you, chosen chronicler of  fashionable society, can find to record in the dead season?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, the most stupendous scandals are  those that happen in the dead season, when Paris is a desert, and a man thinks  he can murder his neighbour or run away with his neighbour&rsquo;s wife with equal  impunity. Ah, my friend, for the development of intrigue, for the ripening of  social mysteries, the working out of domestic tragedies, there can be no better  time than this dull blank interval of the year, when there is no one in Paris.  What stolen meetings, what little suppers in closely-sealed cabinets, when  Madame is at the seaside and Monsieur is shooting wild boar in Auvergne! Heaven  only forbid that Monsieur and Madame should happen to take their supper in  adjacent cabinets, and that Monsieur should recognise the voice of Madame on  the other side of the lath and plaster! Yes, there is no richer harvest-time  for the chronicler than the season when there is not a mortal in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cynic!&rdquo; exclaimed Heathcote. &ldquo;And so you still  live by exposing the faults and follies of your fellow-creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to reform them by proving to them that  sooner or later all social secrets are known. I am about the only preacher  whose sermons scare them nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you consider your trade a strictly honourable  one, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In French no doubt means perhaps,&rdquo; replied Trottier,  &ldquo;<em>vide</em> Michelet. No, I will say  nothing for my calling, except that a man must live. You may not see the  necessity of my living, but the existence of the lowest of us has its value to  the man himself. The world might get on very well without me, but I can&rsquo;t get  on without the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man of your talent might have done well in any  other line&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon; mine is not a talent. It is a specialty. I  should have succeeded in no other line. If I had been rich and high-placed,  like Saint-Simon, I should have kept my impressions to myself while I lived,  and should have left a big book behind me when I died. But I am poor and a  nobody, so I have had to live upon my impressions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put the case neatly,&rdquo; said Heathcote, &ldquo;and you  are right. We are most of us the thing which circumstances make us. The man who  will not allow himself to be moulded by circumstance, who will strike out into  the empyrean of ideal good, is one man in a thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the odds are that your one in a thousand, your  honest man, is an eminently disagreeable personage &mdash; like Diogenes or Thomas  Carlyle,&rdquo; said Trottier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not finished your evening&rsquo;s work, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am in for another hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Heathcote; &ldquo;then at midnight you will  be free. Will you sup with me at the Caf&eacute; de Paris when your work is done? I  believe it is in your power to do me a material service merely by calling upon  your recollection of the past. Will you meet me at the Caf&eacute; de Paris at  twelve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure; and if my poor memories of men and events  can help you, the record is at your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks. I will go and order supper, and  stroll on the Boulevard till it is ready. <em>Au  revoir!</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier was a man who kept his  appointments. He was not neat in his person, or punctual in his payments. He  never went to church, and he did not always wash. But if he promised a page of  copy to a newspaper, the page was delivered in due time. If he offered to frank  a friend to the theatre, in his quality as critic, he was waiting in the  vestibule at the appointed hour, ready to keep his word. If he accepted an  invitation to supper, he never kept his host waiting. Invitations to dinner he  invariably declined.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dinner-party is an anti-climax,&rdquo; he protested.  &ldquo;A man gets drunk too early, and spoils his evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At midnight Monsieur Trottier&rsquo;s evening began, and  he was ready for the feast.</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote received him in one of the cosiest  little rooms in the caf&eacute;. The Englishman&rsquo;s first act on entering had been to  light all the wax candles on the mantelpiece, which the waiters had left  unlighted. This established him at once as a man who knew his Paris, and his  judicious choice of wines having strengthened his position, everything was  ready when Trottier&rsquo;s shabby olive-green coat came meekly into the radiance of  the wax candles. Trottier was known at the Caf&eacute; de Paris, and his shabby coat  commanded the reverence of the waiters. Was he not a man who, as it were,  carried reputations in his pocket, who could make a head-waiter famous by a  stroke of his pen?</p>
<p>The supper was delicate, <em>recherch&eacute;</em>, Parisian; the wine was Johannisberger of princely  quality, and a magnum of Mumms decanted in a cut-crystal pitcher appeared with  the last course. The two men talked of general topics during supper. It was  only when the waiters had withdrawn, and when Sigismond Trottier had thrown  himself back in his chair and lighted his cigarette, that Heathcote approached  the business of the evening. It was half-past one o&rsquo;clock, and the roll of  wheels upon the asphalte below the open window had been gradually diminishing.  There was no longer the roar of the Boulevard to disturb the speakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can be of the slightest use to you, as an  embodied chronicle of Paris, command me,&rdquo; said Trottier. &ldquo;Here I am at your  service &mdash; an open book. You have only to turn my leaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember a double murder &mdash; the murder of an  actress and her lover &mdash; which happened ten years ago, in the forest of  Saint-Germain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I remember? Yes, as if the thing had happened  last week; and for a good reason. The man who was suspected &mdash; the lover, or, as  some thought, the husband, of the actress &mdash; was my familiar friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Heaven!&rdquo; exclaimed Heathcote, almost  starting from his chair. &ldquo;Then my instinct was right. It told me that I should  get on the track of that man &mdash; it told me that you must have known him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man was well known to me and to a chosen few,  but only a few,&rdquo; replied Trottier. &ldquo;He was a man of eccentric habits &mdash; a man of  considerable talent and large intellect, who could afford to live his own life,  and lived it. What he did with himself in the daytime none of us knew: whether  he slept away half his daylight life, or shut himself in his den and smoked and  dreamed and read. The latter idea seemed likely enough, for he was a man who  had read widely. He was a delightful companion, brilliant, genial, lavish to  his friends, a splendid host. I have supped with him and Marie Pr&eacute;vol many a  night in this house &mdash; sometimes making the third in a cosy trio, sometimes one  of that small choice circle with which he occasionally surrounded himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I take it that he was known in general  society, either the uppermost or the middle circles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least in the world. He was a man who  scorned society, hated ceremonies and conventionalities. I never saw him in a  dress-suit. I doubt if he possessed one. When he went to a theatre, it was to  sit in a dark corner, where he could see without being seen. He detested  crowds. He had nothing to gain from the great world, and could afford to  outrage all its rules and regulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was he a thoroughbred Parisian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from it. He was an American, but he had lived  so long in Paris as to be almost as Parisian as a citizen born and bred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had he made his money, or inherited it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inherited it, without doubt. His habits were those  of the spender, not the worker. He was one of the lilies of the field, who toil  not, neither do they spin. I take it that his father had been one of those  daring speculators who in America begin with nothing and become millionaires in  a year or two. As for the man himself, he had no more idea of business or  finance than one of those dressed-up dolls of the Quartier Br&eacute;da. He took not  the faintest interest in the transactions of the Bourse, and in that point alone  revealed himself as no true Parisian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you believe that he committed the murder?&rdquo;  asked Heathcote.</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier shrugged his shoulders, and  shook back his long gray hair, as he slowly puffed his cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I liked the man so well that  I should hesitate at saying I believe in his guilt. And yet the fact of his  disappearance from the hour of the murder is almost conclusive evidence; and I  know that he was savagely jealous of Maucroix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You judged him a man of strong passions, a man  capable of a great crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he was a man of intense feeling, strong for  good or evil. A volcano glowed under that calm outward aspect, that easy-going,  devil-may-care manner of his. I was very sorry for him. If Marie had been but  true&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe that she was his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do. His manner to her was in all respects the  manner of one who esteemed as well as loved her. He introduced her to his  friends as his wife. He loved her too well to have refused her that title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But for a man who scorned conventionalities, what  reason could there have been for concealment? Why should he not have introduced  his actress-wife to society? Why should he not have established a home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first question is easily answered. As he  loathed society for himself, he would hardly court it for his wife. The second  can only be answered by the fact that the man was an eccentric. He preferred  the freedom of an actress&rsquo;s lodging to the restrictions of a rich man&rsquo;s house.  His happiest days were spent wandering southward with the swallows; yet so  strange was the man&rsquo;s temper that he never stayed more than a fortnight or  three weeks away from Paris. The city seemed to draw him back like a magnet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet he had no business here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I ever discovered. He must have loved the  city for its own sake. He was here all through the siege and the Commune. I  have heard him say that the happiest days of his life were those on which the  roar of the Prussian guns made his only music, and when Marie and he used to  crouch and shiver over a handful of charcoal, and eat a supper of dry bread and  Carlsbad plums.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had some <em>pied-&agrave;-terre</em> of his own, I conclude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have had his den somewhere in Paris; but  none of us knew where it was. The only address he ever gave was that of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol, <em>alias</em> Madame Georges, in the  Rue Lafitte. He met his friends on the Boulevard when the theatres were over.  He was a man who enjoyed life to the full &mdash; after his own fashion. He was the  master-spirit of his little circle &mdash; a daring wit, a bold politician, a  trenchant critic. Paris is the city of brilliant talkers, yet I have known few  who surpassed Georges as a conversationalist. I can see him now, with his long  fair hair falling over his flashing eyes, his sarcastic lip, and the proud  carriage of that leonine head. Not a common man by any means, and with a laugh  that was like music &mdash; a man for a woman to adore; and yet Marie wavered in her  fidelity directly a fashionable dandy made love to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea what became of Georges after the  murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had, I would not tell you. No, I have not the  faintest inkling. He vanished as a bubble that bursts upon the surface of a  stream. As a mere guess, I should say that he went back to the country of his  birth &mdash; that if he is still living, he is to be found in America under another  name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a rich man, you say. It is easier for a man  to betake himself from one country to another than to transfer his fortune.  What became of this man&rsquo;s French investments?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may never have had any such investments. His  fortune may have been invested solely in America. He was a man who declared  that he valued liberty above all other blessings. He would scarcely have  fettered himself by investing any portion of his wealth in a country where he  was leading a life of pleasure, living as a pure Bohemian. His utter  indifference to all rumours about the Bourse would show that he had no French  investments. His wealth, I take it, came from some secure source on the other  side of the Atlantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear him talk of an English friend,  or a friend who resided in England?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet he must have had such a friend,&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>He related the story of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s death,  and the inducement that had taken her to England, where she was to have met a  friend of her aunt&rsquo;s long-vanished lover. Sigismond Trottier listened with  keenest interest. All social mysteries, whether criminal or not, had a charm  for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very strange case,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t  wonder that you are following it up earnestly. No, I never heard Georges  mention any English friend. It was a bold stroke for the grandmother to send  the girl to a man who was the friend of the murderer of her daughter. A  drowning man will catch at a straw, says your proverb; and this poor woman,  penniless and friendless on her death-bed, may have caught at the name of the  only rich man upon whom she could advance the faintest claim. And what was the  nature of that claim? A packet of Georges&rsquo; love-letters. Compromising  love-letters, perhaps, to be offered to Georges&rsquo; friend as the price of  protection and aid for the orphan girl. A strange story. And no one knows what  became of those letters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one, as yet. No letters were found upon the  girl. Even the handbag she carried with her had disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very strange story. I wish I could help you to  read the riddle. Your interest in it I imagine to be something beyond the mere  artistic interest in a curious case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am concerned in arriving at the truth, for  the sake of one whom I honour and revere. I shall be deeply grateful if you can  help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will help you,&rdquo; answered the paragraphist  quietly; and Edward Heathcote felt that in this amateur detective he had a  stronger ally than in the old police-officer of the left bank.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter14"></a>Chapter 14<br>
  Bothwell Begins To See His Way</h2>
<p>Dreary days followed for Bothwell Grahame after  that final interview with Lady Valeria. He had broken his bonds, he had escaped  from the Circe whose fatal spells had held him captive so long. He was his own  man again, he could stand up before his fellow-men and fear no reproach &mdash; nay,  he could even dare to meet that kind old man whose friendship had never been  withheld from him. He could look General Harborough in the face, and clasp his  hand without feeling himself a craven and a traitor, and that is a thing which  he had not been able to do for the last three years.</p>
<p>He was relieved, rejoiced at the breaking of that  old tie, and yet there was a touch of pain in such a parting. There came a  bitter pang of remorse now and again to disturb his sense of newly-recovered  peace. Such severances can never happen without pain. The man who can be  utterly indifferent to the agony of a woman he has once loved must have a heart  of stone. Bothwell was not stony-hearted. He knew that Valeria Harborough was  not a good woman &mdash; that she had been shamefully false to the best of husbands &mdash;  that she had abandoned herself recklessly to the promptings of a fatal passion.  But he had loved her once: and his heart bled for her now in her misery and  abandonment. He was haunted by the vision of her face, as she had risen up  before him, white as the very dead, her eyes flashing, her lips quivering, her  voice subdued by passion to a serpent-like hiss, as she told him &mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in love with another woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, that was what it all came to. That was the  sum-total of his scruples, his remorse of conscience: or at least that is what  it must needs seem in the sight of the woman he abandoned. She would give him  no credit for many a remorseful pang, many a sting of conscience in the past;  yes, even in the noontide of passion, when he deemed that for him Fate held not  the possibility of another love. In her sight he was a perjurer and a  hypocrite. It was hard so to appear to the woman who had worshipped him; hard  to know that there was a heart breaking for him yonder in the Italian villa on  the hill above the sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I grieve about her?&rdquo; he asked himself  angrily. &ldquo;I must be a coxcomb to fancy that she is making herself unhappy for  my sake. She was angry with me the other day. It was rage, not wounded love,  that flashed from those brilliant eyes of hers; the rage of slighted beauty.  She is far more concerned for her losses on the turf than at the loss of me. If  my Dido mounts the funeral pyre, it will be because she has made a bad book,  and not for my sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But argue with himself as he might, Bothwell could  not forget the agony in the face that had once been his delight, the despair in  the voice which had bidden him farewell, the tremulous hand which had snatched  the love-token to fling it away in deepest scorn.</p>
<p>Perhaps Bothwell would have more easily forgotten  these things if he could have had the comfort of Hilda&rsquo;s society at this period  of his life. But Hilda and the twins and Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein had all gone off  to Dawlish for sea-bathing, and Mrs. Wyllard warned her cousin that he must not  attempt to follow them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are on your probation, my poor Bothwell,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;and you must be very careful how you act. If you were to go to Dawlish  you would only distress Hilda, who has promised not to see you till her brother  comes back from Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going there. I would not distress her for  worlds. I am to wait patiently till Heathcote has made up his mind that I am  not in the habit of throwing girls over viaducts; and then I may go to my  darling and claim her promise. In the mean time I can at least write to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he did write, within a few hours of his final  interview with Lady Valeria. His letter was full and straight in its  significance.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My dearest, I am my own man again. I am free, or  as free as a man can be who is your most abject slave. I am told that I am not  to be allowed to see you till I stand acquitted of the crime which Bodmin has  judged me quite capable of committing. I think, little as you know of me, you  know enough to be very sure that I am innocent upon that count.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;But there was another count upon which I confess  myself guilty, Hilda &mdash; and it was that old sin which made me hang back months  ago when I longed to tell you of my love. I have been guilty of a foolish  attachment to a married woman, an attachment which lasted with varying fervour  for over a year, but which had quite worn itself out before I left India. The  flame burnt fiercely enough for a little while, and then came total extinction.  Only it is not always easy for a man to shake off old fetters; and it was not  till your pure and noble love gave me courage that I dared to stand up boldly  and say, &lsquo;That old false love is dead; let us bury it decently.&rsquo; And now the  old love is buried, Hilda, and I am all your own. No one is any the worse for  that old sentimental folly. Such flirtations are going on in India every day.  Some end in guilt and misery, no doubt; but there are more that finish as mine  has finished, like the blowing out of a candle.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Can you forgive me, dear one, for having once  cared for another? Remember it was before I knew you. Henceforward I am yours,  and yours only. I claim your dear promise. I ask you to engage yourself to a  man whom Bodmin looks upon askance as a possible murderer.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;No, love, I will not exact so much. I will only  tell you that I am all your own, and that I adore you. We will not talk about  engagements till your brother comes back from Paris, convinced of my innocence  as to that one particular charge, and until Bodmin has begun to forget that it  ever suspected me. &mdash; Your adoring BOTHWELL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having written this letter, Bothwell had nothing to  do but to ride about the hills, thinking of his sweetheart, till he received  her answer.</p>
<p>She wrote with unstinted tenderness, and recoiled  in nowise from the fulfilment of her promise.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I hold myself engaged to you henceforward, dear  Bothwell,&rdquo; she wrote, &ldquo;through good or evil fortune, good or evil report. But  as I have promised my brother not to see you while he is away, it might be well  that we did not write to each other again until after his return. I think you  know that I am steadfast, and that you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he was very sure of her steadfastness. Was she  not one woman in a thousand to have pledged herself to him just when any  ordinary woman would have shunned him &mdash; would have recoiled from him as from  some savage monster? She had been calm, and steadfast, and unfearing, a woman  who could dare to judge for herself.</p>
<p>And now Bothwell Grahame felt that he had crossed  the threshold of a new life. He was no longer a solitary waif, with no one to  think of but himself. He had not only his own future to work out with patience  and courage. He had to think of the young wife, whom it might be his blessed  fate to claim before he was much older. He could no longer afford to be vague  and wavering. The problem of a gentleman-like maintenance must be worked out by  him somehow, and without loss of time.</p>
<p>He walked across the Cornish hills in those balmy  afternoons of September, full of thought and full of care; happy, yes,  ineffably happy in the knowledge of Hilda&rsquo;s love; but care went along with  happiness. He had to provide for his beloved. Long and thoughtful  self-examination brought him to one positive conclusion about himself. Whatever  he was to do in the future, if he were to do it well, must be, in somewise, the  thing that he had done in the past. He was a soldier to the marrow of his  bones, and it was in military work, or military studies, that he must find his  future living.</p>
<p>This was the plan which he worked out for himself  during those solitary rambles on the moor, sometimes with gun and dogs,  sometimes with no companion save his own thoughts. He would fall back upon the  studious habits of his earlier years, work at the science of soldiery as he had  worked then. He would take a house in one of the villages on the wild coast of  North Cornwall &mdash; at Trevena perhaps, in King Arthur&rsquo;s country &mdash; some roomy old  house with a good garden, and he would take pupils to cram for the military  examinations. He knew that he could get on with young men. He had always been  popular with the subalterns of his regiment. He would work honestly,  conscientiously, devotedly as ever coach or crammer worked since the art of  coaching and cramming was first invented. It would be a jog-trot humble kind of  life, a life which could never lead to distinction, far from a brilliant future  to offer to such a girl as Hilda Heathcote. Yet he told himself that it was  such a life as would not be altogether distasteful to her. It was a life in  which husband and wife need be but seldom parted, in which all their amusements  and relaxations could be shared. They could hunt, and shoot, and ride, and boat  together on that wild coast. The conventionalities would cost them very little.  Fine clothes, fine living would not be required of them: and in their rustic  seclusion they would escape the ghastly struggle to maintain showy appearances;  they could afford themselves all the comforts of a homely unpretentious <em>m&eacute;nage</em>.</p>
<p>Bothwell felt that it was in him to do good and  honest work in such a career as this; surely better than sheep-breeding or  gold-digging in some savage quarter of the earth, where the intellectual man  must gradually sink to the level of his companion brutes. He pictured to  himself the tranquil happiness of such a life. The long morning of  conscientious work, followed by the afternoon ride or ramble. The summer  holiday after a successful term; the adventurous excursion among Scottish lakes  or in some foreign land; the cherished home, gradually developed and improved  from its primitive homeliness into a thing of beauty. The garden in which wife  and husband and pupils worked together towards the attainment of a lofty ideal.  The union of a household which should be as one family.</p>
<p>Cheered by such visions, Bothwell took up his old  technical books with an almost rabid hunger for study. He sent to London for  the newest treatises on gunnery. He flung himself with heart and mind into the  one line of study which had always interested him. Hilda had told him not to  write to her; but he could not deny himself the delight of unfolding his  newly-formed plan, which he explained to her upon five sheets of  closely-written note-paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me have just one more letter from you, dearest,&rdquo;  he pleaded in conclusion, &ldquo;to tell me what you think of my scheme, and where we  ought to look for a house. Shall it be Trevena or Boscastle or Padstow or New  Quay? I think we ought to be near the sea, so that our lads may get plenty of  boating and swimming. And I could teach you to row. We would live at least half  our lives in the open air, and we would study natural history in all its  branches. I fancy myself an ideal coach. I know my pupils would adore me, while  you would be to them as a divinity. Our evenings could be devoted to music; we  could get up one of Sullivan&rsquo;s operas, and perform for the benefit of the  school or the church. We should be the most useful people in our parish. It  would be a humble jog-trot life, darling; but I believe it would be a happy one  for both of us. I know that for me it would be Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer came by return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear Bothwell, your scheme is charming.  Trevena is a delicious place, and I should delight in living there. I shall  have a little money when I come of age, I believe &mdash; more than enough to furnish  our house. Shall we be medi&aelig;val or Chippendale? I say Chippendale. And we must  get an old house, for the sake of the panelling and the staircase; and we must  pull it all to pieces on account of the drains. And now you must not write to  me any more till Edward comes home. I have had a curious letter from him. He is  deeply absorbed in unravelling some dreadful mystery. He has not yet found the  murderer of that poor girl, but I can see that he no longer suspects <em>you</em>. How could he ever have harboured  that monstrous idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheered by such a letter as this, Bothwell worked  as if he had been on the eve of some great examination &mdash; worked as if his life  depended on those long hours of toil. Yes, he would get a house at Trevena &mdash;  the sooner the better. He had felt of late as if the atmosphere of Penmorval  stifled him. He had been too long a hanger-on upon his rich cousin. He was  angry with himself for having dawdled and procrastinated, and let life slide by  him, while he waited as if for a vision from heaven, to point out the road, in  which he should walk. And now the seraphic vision had been granted to him; but  the angel wore the shape of Hilda Heathcote. Hilda had inspired him with the  desire to stay in England, to earn his bread in his own country, and out of  that wish had arisen this scheme of his. He would lose no time in putting his  plan into execution. Of late he had read aversion in the eyes of Julian Wyllard  &mdash; or it may have been contempt for his idle life, for his dependence. In any  case there was that in Wyllard&rsquo;s manner which rendered existence at Penmorval  hateful for Bothwell Grahame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he, too, suspects me,&rdquo; Bothwell told  himself. &ldquo;He thinks it quite possible that I flung that girl into the gorge.  Society is always ready to impute evil to an idler. There is that old doggerel  of Dr. Watts about the mischief that Satan finds for idle hands to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rode across country to Trevena the day after he  received Hilda&rsquo;s frank and loving letter. He was not going to wait until his  darling was able to marry him before beginning his new life. He would set up  his establishment as soon as the thing could be done, take pupils at once, get  over all the roughness, the difficulty of the start, before he asked Hilda to share  his home. Nor was he going to furnish his house with his wife&rsquo;s money. That was  just one of the things he would not consent to do. He had his idea as to how he  should furnish his house when he found one to his liking. Of course he was not  going to decide upon any house until Hilda had seen it and approved the choice.  But in the mean time he rode off to Trevena on a voyage of discovery.</p>
<p>It was a long ride, and a hilly road, but not too  long for the new hunter Glencoe, an animal with a tremendous reserve of force  that had to be taken out of him somehow, an accumulated store of kicks and  plunges which a clever rider could compound for in a good fast trot along the  road, or a swinging gallop across the moorland. Bothwell and his horse were on  excellent terms by the time they had gone three miles together, although the  brute had insisted on going through Bodmin in a series of buck-jumps.</p>
<p>Life at Penmorval had been just a shade more sombre  in its hue for the last week. Dora Wyllard had not been able altogether to  overcome her offended feeling at that unwarrantable burst of passion upon her  husband&rsquo;s part, which had followed Edward Heathcote&rsquo;s visit. That he should  upbraid and insult her, that he should be jealous &mdash; he for whose sake she had  jilted an upright and honourable man, he to whom she had given all the devotion  of her life! It seemed to her an almost unpardonable weakness and littleness on  Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s part. And she had thought his character above all pettinesses  common to meaner men. She had loved him because he was noble-hearted and  large-minded.</p>
<p>His indifference to Bothwell&rsquo;s good name, his  selfish coldness upon a question which to her was vital, had wounded her to the  quick. She was not a woman to give way to sullenness, to shut herself up in the  armour of angry pride, to give ungracious answers and scant courtesy to the  husband who had offended her. Yet there was a subtle change in her manner and  bearing which was perceptible to Julian Wyllard, and which he felt keenly.</p>
<p>Neither husband nor wife had recurred by so much as  one word or hint to that scene in the yew-tree arbour. Life had glided by for  these last few days in just the same manner as of old; but the shadow was there  all the same. The mild genius of domestic love had veiled his face.</p>
<p>Dora was sitting in the library with her husband at  post-time on the day of Bothwell&rsquo;s ride to Trevena. Julian Wyllard was at his  desk writing, while his wife sat in her favourite window, absorbed in a new  book, with the open box from Mudie&rsquo;s at her feet, when the servant brought in  the post-bag. Dora watched her husband intently as he unlocked the bag and took  out a pile of letters and papers. He looked up as he was sorting the letters,  and surprised that earnest expression in his wife&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are expecting some important letter?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am anxious to hear from Mr. Heathcote,&rdquo; she  answered quietly.</p>
<p>It was the first time that name had been spoken by  either of them since the scene in the arbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is your letter, then, in Heathcote&rsquo;s hand,  with the Paris post-mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; She rose, and walked across to the  desk to receive her letters. &ldquo;I hope he has some good news for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went back to the window, and opened Heathcote&rsquo;s  letter, standing by the open window in the full light of the September  afternoon, her husband watching her all the while. Her face brightened as she  read. There was no need for him to ask if the news were good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter seems satisfactory,&rdquo; he said,  unfolding the <em>Times</em> as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good letter,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It tells me  that Mr. Heathcote has begun to see how wrong he was in suspecting Bothwell. He  has evidently made some discovery about that poor girl&rsquo;s fate. He, at any rate,  has found out who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Wyllard, deep in a leading-article.  &ldquo;He has found out who she is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He writes her name as if I ought to know all  about her. He is still groping in the dark, he says, but he hopes to fathom the  mystery of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Mr. Wyllard was absorbed by  the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were not listening, Julian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, yes, I was. L&eacute;onie Lemarque &mdash; a French name. We  were right, then, in supposing that the girl was French?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid aside the newspaper, and began to open his  letters; but he said not a word more about Heathcote&rsquo;s news. Dora felt that he  might have been more interested &mdash; more sympathetic. It was her cousin whose  reputation and happiness were at stake. Affection for her should have made  these things of greater moment to her husband.</p>
<p>Bothwell came home in time for the eight-o&rsquo;clock  dinner, and in excellent spirits. He had seen an old cottage standing in a  large garden, with a fine old orchard adjoining, a cottage which could be  converted, by considerable additions, into a capital house for himself and his  pupils. The situation was superb. The cottage stood on a height, near the  junction of two roads, and it commanded magnificent views of sea and coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could make the additions I want for three or  four hundred pounds,&rdquo; he told Dora, when he was alone with her in the drawing-room  after dinner. &ldquo;I should be my own architect and my own builder. I should only  have to pay for labour and materials. I did a goodish deal in the building line  when I was in the army, you know, Dora, supervising the alterations of the  Jungapore barracks. I know more about bricks and mortar than you would give me  credit for knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had previously confided his idea of taking  pupils, and Dora had approved, and had promised her heartiest cooperation. He  was sure of her sympathy with all his endeavours to win an honourable  independence at home. The idea of his emigrating had always been unwelcome to  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Dora, I am going to make a very audacious  proposition,&rdquo; he said, when he had finished his description of the cottage at  Trevena. &ldquo;I want you to lend me seven hundred pounds, to be repaid in  half-yearly instalments of one hundred pounds during the next three years and a  half, with or without interest, as you may think fit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose we say nothing about the repayment,  Bothwell,&rdquo; said his cousin, smiling at him as she looked up from her  embroidery. &ldquo;You shall have the seven hundred pounds; and we will decide by and  by whether it is to be a loan or a gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, you are too generous&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Bothwell. I always intended to furnish  you with a small capital if you made up your mind to emigrate. I had much  rather give you the money to invest at home. You are the last of my clan &mdash; my  only near relative &mdash; and I don&rsquo;t want to lose you. I look to you and Hilda, and  your children, to brighten the decline of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Dora, that seems a poor substitute for those who  should be nearer and dearer,&rdquo; cried Bothwell. In the next instant he would  gladly have recalled his words, for he saw the tears well up to his cousin&rsquo;s  eyes, and he knew that her childless marriage was a grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too good, far more generous than I  deserve,&rdquo; he went on hurriedly. &ldquo;But let the money be at least called a loan.  If fortune favour me within the next few years, it will be such a pleasure to  give you back your money. And if Fate prove unkind, I shall know I have not a  hard creditor. But I have made up my mind to be successful. I mean to work as  men seldom work &mdash; to make everything I do a labour of love. And with such a  wife as Hilda&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilda will be a wife in a thousand. I am sure your  pupils will adore her; and you must make your house very pretty, for Hilda&rsquo;s  sake. Seven hundred will not be half enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be more than enough. You don&rsquo;t know how  economically I can build, and how cleverly Hilda and I will contrive to  furnish. We will ride over the country to overhaul all the cottages and  farmhouses in quest of neglected old bits of Chippendale and Sheraton. We shall  get lovely old things for a mere song, and find some clever jobbing  cabinet-maker to make them as good as new&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the end you will find they will have cost  you more than if you had bought them from Nosotti,&rdquo; said Dora, laughing at his  eagerness. &ldquo;I know how costly that kind of economy is apt to prove in the  long-run. You had better get your Sheraton or your Chippendale furniture made  on purpose for you, new and sound and convenient, and of more charming designs  than Chippendale ever imagined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dora. I am intense as a Chippendalist. I must  have the real thing &mdash; old, and inconvenient even, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a boy you are still, Bothwell! And now I am  going to tell you something that will please you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilda is coming here to-morrow,&rdquo; speculated  Bothwell eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Hilda is not coming back while her brother is  away. That is not my good news, Bothwell. It is even better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she told him the contents of Heathcote&rsquo;s  letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;That is at  least one knocked off the list of my suspicious friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard came into the drawing-room while the  cousins were sitting together talking, their heads bending towards each other.  The family likeness between them was very strong. They looked like brother and  sister; and they looked very happy.</p>
<p>Dora was in the garden next day when the postman  brought his bag. She was no longer anxious about her letters, having received  the expected tidings from Paris. She was moving slowly about among her roses,  armed with a basket and a pair of garden scissors, cutting off blind buds and  shabby blooms, making war upon her insect enemies &mdash; enjoying the balmy air and  warm sunshine of early autumn.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard came out of the glass door while she  was thus occupied. She looked up at the sound of the familiar footsteps, and  went across the grass to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora, are you inclined to go for a week&rsquo;s  holiday with me?&rdquo; he asked, in his cheeriest tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am always ready to go anywhere with you. Is it  because you have not been feeling well of late that you want to leave  Penmorval?&rdquo; she asked, looking anxiously at him, remembering his strange  irritation, that burst of jealousy, which might be after all only the  indication of an overworked brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been feeling over well &mdash; a little  worried and irritable, and more than a little weak and languid,&rdquo; he answered.  &ldquo;But it is not on that account I want to go away. You remember my losing the  Raffaelle last July?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there is a still finer Raffaelle to be sold  next week in Paris, at the H&ocirc;tel Drouot. The great Rochejaquelin collection  comes to the hammer. There are some of the finest Greuzes in Europe. There are  Meissoniers of the highest quality, and a famous Delaroche. I may not buy any  of the pictures. No doubt the prices will be enormous. But I should like to see  the collection once more, before it is scattered to the four winds. Would you  mind running over to Paris with me for a week, or would you rather stay at home  while I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like very much to go. I have never been  in Paris with you, except hurrying through from station to station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you not? That is strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never even seen the house where you lived  when you were making your fortune in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would not be much to see. A ground floor near  the Madeleine. A capital point for a business man; within ten minutes&rsquo; walk of  the Bourse, and in that central spot where the idlers and the workers alike  congregate. A most uninteresting nest, Dora; nothing historical, or  picturesque, or romantic, within half a mile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be enough for me that you lived and worked  there. You must have worked very hard in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was not one of the butterflies, I assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Distin told me that you turned your back upon  all the dissipations and pleasures of Paris, that you were a man of one idea,  working only for one end &mdash; to make a great fortune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the only way for a poor man to grow rich.  I had to make brain-labour and concentration serve me instead of capital. I had  the good luck to enter the Parisian Bourse at a period when fortunes might be  made by hard thinking &mdash; when to win in the game of speculation was a question  of mathematics. Nature and schooling had made me a decent mathematician, and I  used all the science I had in fighting the <em>coulissiers</em> with their own weapons. But I am talking a language which you can&rsquo;t understand,  Dora. Let the past be past. You and I have only to spend the money I earned in  those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are always spending your wealth for the good  of others, Julian,&rdquo; his wife answered tenderly. &ldquo;Providence ought to bless the  riches you earned in your laborious youth. I cannot imagine you caring for  money for its own sake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did so care for it, Dora. Money in my mind  meant power. I began life as a poor man&rsquo;s son, and tasted all the bitterness of  narrow means. In my boyhood I told myself that I would be rich before I grew  old, and to that end I worked as few men work. I was able to surround my mother  with luxury during the closing years of her life. I was able to give my sister  a dowry that helped the man of her choice to make his way in the world years  before he could have done so without that aid. She did not live very long to  enjoy her happiness, poor girl; but her last days were brightened by  prosperity. No, Dora, I was not a money-grubber, but I made speculation a  science, and I turned the age in which I lived to good account. It is not often  given to a speculator to live in such a golden age as the days of Morny and  Jecker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you would do nothing that was not  strictly honourable,&rdquo; said Dora, with her bright trusting look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, I belonged to the honourable section of the  Bourse,&rdquo; replied Wyllard, with a somewhat cynical smile. &ldquo;I had my office and  my agents in London, and was a power on the Stock Exchange; and when I had  acquired a reputation as a financier on both sides of the Channel, I founded  the firm of Wyllard &amp; Morrison, with one of the richest merchants in London  for my partner. A man in my position could soil his fingers with no doubtful  enterprise. Well, Dora, it is agreed you will go to Paris with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was happier than she had felt since that cloud  of anger had passed across her domestic horizon. Julian&rsquo;s manner was franker,  fonder, more like his old self &mdash; the man who had won her away from that other  noble-minded man to whom she had promised herself &mdash; the man for whose sake she  had been willing to break her promise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you be ready to start to-morrow morning? The  sale takes place three days hence, and I want to have a good look at the  pictures before they come to the hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will be ready whenever you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll leave by the morning train, and go  straight on to Paris by the night mail. You will be able to see Heathcote, and  hear how his investigation progresses. Where is he staying, by the way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the H&ocirc;tel de Bade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drop him a line, and ask him to call on us at  the Windsor. It is an old-fashioned family hotel, where I think you will be  more comfortable than at one of those huge palaces, where you may be surfeited  with splendid upholstery, but rarely get your bell answered under a quarter of  an hour. You will take Priscilla, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla was Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s maid, Cornish to the  marrow, and a severe Primitive Methodist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla in Paris? No, I think not. She was so  wretched in Italy. The very smell of the incense offended her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not be overpowered by incense in Paris  nowadays. She is more likely to be offended by a new Age of Reason. However, if  you think you can do without her&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can. We shall not be visiting, I  suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, I think. It is the dullest of dull seasons  in Paris just now, and I had never a large visiting acquaintance in that city.  I was too busy a man to go into society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been a stoic to resist the  temptations of Parisian society &mdash; the writers, the painters, singers, actors &mdash; all  that is foremost and brightest in the intellectual world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are circles and circles in Paris, as well as  in London. I have been in Parisian assemblies that were eminently dull,&rdquo; said  Wyllard.</p>
<p>They started from Penmorval after breakfast next  morning, and were seated in the Dover mail at eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening,  after dining at the Grand Hotel. Dora was in excellent spirits. Change of scene  had a brightening effect upon her mind, and she was very happy in the idea of  Hilda and Bothwell&rsquo;s happiness. She had handed her cousin a cheque for seven  hundred pounds, with which he was to open an account at the local bank. And  then he had only to wait for Hilda to approve his choice, before he set to work  with bricklayers and carpenters at improving a cottage into an Elizabethan  Grange. That was his idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will have an Elizabethan Grange furnished with  real Chippendale,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Incongruous, but charming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then be sure that very few of your windows are  made to open,&rdquo; said Dora, laughing at his ardour, &ldquo;if you want to be truly  Elizabethan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every casement shall open to its uttermost width &mdash;  every corner of the house shall be steeped in light and air,&rdquo; protested  Bothwell.</p>
<p>And now Dora Wyllard was reclining in her corner of  the railway compartment, speeding towards Dover through the gray autumn night,  by Kentish hayfields and stubble, and across the gentle undulations of a  Kentish landscape, so different from the bold hills and deep gorges of her  native Cornwall.</p>
<p>There was a reading-lamp hanging on Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s  side of the carriage, and she had the October Quarterlies and a heap of papers  to beguile the journey. Among the papers, was the <em>Times</em> supplement, which she opened for the first time to look at  the births, marriages, and deaths. Mr. Wyllard had read the other part of the  paper before they reached Paddington, but he had not looked at the supplement.</p>
<p>While Dora was looking down the births, marriages,  and deaths in a casual way, her eye was suddenly caught by an advertisement at  the top of the second column.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who was to have met L&eacute;onie Lemarque at  Charing Cross Station on the morning of July 5th last is earnestly requested to  communicate immediately with Messrs. Distin &amp; Son, Solicitors, Furnival&rsquo;s  Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; exclaimed Dora; and then she read  the advertisement to her husband, who was sitting in an opposite corner, with  closed eyes, as if half-asleep.</p>
<p>He started at the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Julian. I did not see that you  were asleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only dozing. L&eacute;onie Lemarque! that was the  name of the girl who was killed, was it not? Then no doubt the advertisement is  put in by Heathcote. The reference to Distin indicates as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have made some further discovery about  that unfortunate girl,&rdquo; said Dora thoughtfully. &ldquo;He must have found out the  date of her arrival in London, and that she came to meet some particular  person. Do you think it was that person who killed her, Julian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora, how can I think about a business of  which I know absolutely nothing? For anything we know, the girl&rsquo;s death may  have been purely accidental, and this person who was to have met her at the  station may be a figment of Heathcote&rsquo;s fancy, and this advertisement only a  feeler thrown out in the hope of obtaining information from some unknown  source. Why any of you should trouble yourselves to solve this mystery is more  than I can understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Julian, did not you yourself send for Mr.  Distin? did you not say that as a magistrate it was your duty&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To do all I could to further the ends of justice.  Most assuredly, Dora. But having engaged the assistance of the cleverest  criminal lawyer in England, and he having failed to fathom the mystery, I had  no more to do. I had done my duty, and I was content to let the matter rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I have been, if people had not suspected  Bothwell. I could have no peace while there was such a cloud upon my cousin&rsquo;s  reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That shows how narrow a view even the cleverest  and most large-minded of women can take of this big world. Surely it can matter  to no man living what a handful of people in a little country town may choose  to think about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell has to spend his life among those  people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you have had your own way in the matter, my  dear Dora; and if you will only allow me to forget all about it, I am content  that you and Heathcote should grope for ever in the labyrinth of that girl&rsquo;s  antecedents. A lady&rsquo;s-maid or a nursery-governess, I suppose, who came to  England to seek her fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora was silent. Once again she felt that there was  a want of sympathy upon her husband&rsquo;s part in this matter. He ought to have  remembered that Bothwell was to her as a brother.</p>
<p>They were in Paris early next morning. Mr. Wyllard  had telegraphed to the proprietor of the Windsor, and had secured charming  rooms on the first floor, with a balcony overlooking the gardens of the  Tuileries. The outer shell of the palace still stood there, a memorial of the  brilliant historic past, and cabs and carriages and omnibuses and wagons were  driving across the once sacred grounds, on the new road that had been lately  cut from the Rue de Rivoli to the quay. It was a splendid Paris upon which Dora  and her husband looked out in the clear freshness of the autumnal morning, but  it was curiously changed from that Imperial Paris which Julian Wyllard had  known twenty years before. It seemed to him this morning, looking across those  ruined palace-walls, the daylight streaming through those vacant windows, as if  he and the world had grown old and dim and feeble since those days.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, and Morny was alive, and Jecker  was a power on the Parisian Bourse, and Julian Wyllard was laying the  foundation-stones of his fortune. He had started the Cr&eacute;dit Mauresque &mdash; that  powerful association which had dealt with the wealth of Eastern princes and  Jewish traders, had almost launched a company for the rebuilding of the Temple  at Jerusalem, had ridden gaily over the perilous ocean of public enterprise for  some time, and had made great fortunes for the four or five gifted individuals  whose second sight revealed to them the right hour at which to withdraw their  capital from the scheme.</p>
<p>Yes, it had been a glorious Paris in those days, a  city in which a young Englishman with a mathematical brain could court the  goddess Fortune more profitably than in his native capital. Julian Wyllard had  earned his bread upon the London Stock Exchange for some years before he  changed the scene of his labours to Paris; but it was upon the Paris Bourse  that he began to make his fortune.</p>
<p>Dora was tired after her journey, for she had been  too full of thought to sleep in the train, and even now her brain was too  active for the possibility of rest. So, after dressing and breakfasting, she  accompanied her husband to the great Parisian auction rooms to look at the  Rochejaquelin collection.</p>
<p>The inspection of the pictures lasted over two  hours. Julian Wyllard was an ardent connoisseur, and his wife sympathised with  him in his love of art. Together they criticised the gems of the collection,  and stood in silent admiration before the famous Raffaelle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will fetch thousands,&rdquo; said Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not buy it, if you really wish to possess it?&rdquo;  said Dora. &ldquo;Why should we hoard our money? There is no one to come after us.  Penmorval may be a show place when you and I are gone, and your picture-gallery  will give pleasure to hundreds of tourists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there is the rub,&rdquo; sighed her husband,  conscious of the latent melancholy in his wife&rsquo;s speech. &ldquo;&lsquo;No son of mine  succeeding.&rsquo; When you and I are gone there will be no one to care for Penmorval  &mdash; no one to cherish your garden, and say, &lsquo;My mother planted these roses, or  planned these walks&rsquo; &mdash; no one to treasure the pictures I have collected, for  any reason except their intrinsic value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you take me to see the house in which you  lived and worked?&rdquo; asked Dora, as they were leaving the auction-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora, I can show you the outside of that  historic spot,&rdquo; answered her husband lightly; &ldquo;but I doubt if I can introduce  you to the rooms in which I worked. The present occupant may not be inclined to  sympathise with your hero-worship.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, but I should so like to see those rooms, and I  am sure if the occupier is a gentleman, he will not refuse such a natural  request. Here comes Mr. Heathcote,&rdquo; she exclaimed, as they turned into the  Boulevard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to the H&ocirc;tel Drouot in quest of you,&rdquo;  said Heathcote, as they shook hands. &ldquo;I called at your hotel, and was told you  had gone to the auction-room. How well you are looking, Mrs. Wyllard &mdash; as if  Paris agreed with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your letter took a weight off my mind,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;And now I hope you will be kind to Bothwell and Hilda, and not insist upon too  long an engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that Bothwell and Hilda have taken  their lives into their own hands, and don&rsquo;t want anybody&rsquo;s kindness,&rdquo; he  answered. &ldquo;I have had a tremendous letter from Hilda, telling me her lover&rsquo;s  plans. They are the most independent young people I ever heard of. And pray  what brings you to Paris? Are you going on anywhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we have only come to look at the Rochejaquelin  pictures,&rdquo; answered Wyllard. &ldquo;I have two or three business calls to make in the  neighbourhood of the Bourse. Wyllard &amp; Morrison have still some dealings in  Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am going to look at my husband&rsquo;s old  apartments,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;I have never stayed in Paris since our marriage. My  only knowledge of the city dates from the time when I spent a month at Passy  with my dear mother. What a happy time it was, and how much we contrived to  see! It was in sixty-nine, and people were beginning to talk about war with  Germany. How little did any of us think of the ruin that was coming, when we  saw the Emperor and Empress driving in the Bois!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back to the hotel and lunch with us,  Heathcote,&rdquo; asked Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks; but I am too Parisian to eat at  this hour. I breakfasted at eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we breakfasted less than three hours ago,&rdquo;  said Dora. &ldquo;I am sure we neither of us want luncheon. Let us go and look at  your old home, Julian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not to be called a home, Dora,&rdquo; answered her  husband, with a touch of impatience. &ldquo;A business man&rsquo;s life has only one aspect  &mdash; hard work. However, if you want to see the offices in which a money-grubber  toiled, you shall be gratified. The street is not very far off. Will you walk  there with us?&rdquo; he added, turning to Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly. I am a free man to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Then your criminal investigation, your  amateur-detective work is at a standstill for the moment, I conclude?&rdquo; said  Wyllard, with an ill-concealed sneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the moment, yes,&rdquo; answered the other quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have made some startling discoveries, no  doubt, since you crossed the Channel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my discoveries have been startling; but as  they relate to the remote past, rather than to the period of that poor girl&rsquo;s  death, they are of no particular value at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The remote past? What do you mean by that?&rdquo; asked  Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May we ask the nature of these discoveries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather tell you nothing at present. My  knowledge is altogether fragmentary. Directly I have reduced it to a definite  form &mdash; directly I have a clear and consecutive story to tell &mdash; you and Mrs.  Wyllard shall hear that story. In the mean time I had rather not talk about the  case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have all the professional reticence. And I see  that you and Distin are working together,&rdquo; said Wyllard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw your advertisement in yesterday&rsquo;s <em>Times&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that I had inserted that  advertisement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s name was conclusive &mdash; L&eacute;onie Lemarque:  that was the name of the girl who was killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. But I did not think it was known to any one  except Distin and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mentioned the name in your letter to me,&rdquo; said  Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I really? Then it was unconsciously. I meant  to have told nothing till I could tell the whole story.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter15"></a>Chapter 15<br>
  The Home Of The Past</h2>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wyllard and Heathcote walked on  together to a quiet street near the Madeleine, a street of offices and  wholesale traders.</p>
<p>The house in which Mr. Wyllard had occupied the  ground floor was one of the best in the street, a large stone-fronted house,  with a high doorway and carved columns &mdash; not so richly decorated as those  palatial dwellings of Haussmannised Paris, built during the Second Empire, but  a handsome and somewhat florid style of house notwithstanding. It stood at the  corner of a narrow court, leading no one cared where. Doubtless to some obscure  slum in which the working classes had one of their nooks &mdash; those hidden  colonies which lurk here and there behind the palaces of great cities.</p>
<p>The ground floor was no longer the home of finance  and grave transactions. The house in which Julian Wyllard had schemed and  laboured was now occupied by wholesale dealers in foreign goods of all kinds,  from china to toys, from travelling-bags to Japanese tea-trays, chinoiseries,  unbreakable glass, German lamps, English electro-plate. The house had become  one huge bazaar, which a stranger might enter without much ceremony; albeit  there is a strict etiquette in such establishments, and no retail purchases  were permissible. Only the trade was allowed to buy anything in that dazzling  chaos of small wares.</p>
<p>While all the upper floors had been made into  warehouses, the lower floor had been in somewise respected. The rooms in which  Julian Wyllard had worked were used as offices by Messrs. Bl&uuml;menlein Brothers,  while one of the brothers had made his nest in Julian&rsquo;s old rooms at the back  of the offices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Dora,&rdquo; said Wyllard, pausing on the  threshold of his old abode, &ldquo;I feel that we are going into this house on a  fool&rsquo;s errand. I don&rsquo;t know what excuse to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why make any excuse at all?&rdquo; replied his wife.  &ldquo;Leave the whole business to me, Julian. I want to see your old home, and I am  determined I will see it. I am not at all afraid of Messrs. Bl&uuml;menlein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I will leave you and Heathcote to  manage the matter between you,&rdquo; said Wyllard, with a sudden touch of  impatience, of anger even, his wife thought. &ldquo;I have a business call to make  near here. Heathcote will take you back to your hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel, and was gone before Dora  could make any objection. Again she had seen that dark look in his face which  had so startled and shocked her in the yew-tree arbour. Was it indeed jealousy  of her old lover which so changed him? Her pride revolted at the idea of such  want of faith in one to whom she had given so much.</p>
<p>She allowed no sign of disquietude to escape her,  but went quietly into the office of Messrs. Bl&uuml;menlein, followed by Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me for intruding upon you, gentlemen,&rdquo; she  said in French to the two clerks who were seated at a desk in this outer room.  &ldquo;These offices were some years ago occupied by my husband, and I should esteem  it a favour if you would allow me to see the rooms on this floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A middle-aged man, who was standing near a window  looking through some papers, turned at the sound of her voice, and came over to  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, Madame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Have I he honour  of speaking to Mrs. Wyllard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, I am Mrs. Wyllard. You were my  husband&rsquo;s immediate successor in these rooms, I conclude?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Madame, there was no other occupation. My  brother and I bought this house in &rsquo;seventy-one, almost immediately after the  war; but Mr. Wyllard was the occupant of this floor for some years after we  were in possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly two years,&rdquo; said a second Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein,  appearing from an inner room. &ldquo;Is it possible that Madame has not before seen  these rooms, in which her distinguished husband transacted so much important  business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur, this is my first visit to Paris  since my marriage. I am much interested in seeing these rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be an honour and a pleasure to us to show  them,&rdquo; said the elder of the two brothers. &ldquo;Gustav there, my younger brother,  enjoys the possession of the private apartments almost exactly as Mr. Wyllard  left them. He bought the furniture and fittings, pictures, bronzes, everything  except the books, <em>en bloc</em>, when Mr.  Wyllard gave up his Parisian establishment. Hardly anything has been altered.  These offices can have little interest for you, Madame. They are the <em>facsimile</em> of a thousand other Parisian  offices. But the private apartments have a certain individuality. Gustav, show  Madame the rooms which were once her husband&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a touch of German sentimentality about  Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein, in spite of his Parisian training. He was full of sympathy for  the affectionate wife. He had lofty ideas about the sanctity of home.</p>
<p>The younger brother, Gustav, opened a padded door,  and admitted the two visitors into his bachelor nest.</p>
<p>The first room which they entered was the library,  lined from floor to ceiling with book-shelves, and lighted by a large skylight.  It was a room that had been built out into a yard. It was furnished with carved  oak, in the Henri Deux style, rich, antique, solid. The clock upon the chimney-piece  was a gem of medi&aelig;val metal-work. The covers of chairs and sofas were of old  tapestry, sombre, genuine, artistic.</p>
<p>Adjoining this was the <em>salon</em> and dining-room in one, plainly furnished in the modern  style. The walls were decorated with etchings of the most famous pictures of  the Second Empire. It was a small room; an almost severe simplicity was its  chief characteristic. Nothing here assuredly of the sybarite or the voluptuary,  thought Edward Heathcote, as he contemplated the home of his rival&rsquo;s solitary  manhood.</p>
<p>Bedroom and bathroom completed the suite of  apartments, and even to these Mrs. Wyllard and her companion were admitted.</p>
<p>The bedroom was spacious, lofty, handsomely  furnished in a solid and sombre style. But it was not a cheerful room. It was  situated at the back of the house, and its windows, deeply recessed and heavily  curtained, derived their light from a narrow court. The lower part of each  window was of ground-glass; the upper sashes were violet-tinted, and gave an  artificial colour to the daylight. The curtains were of dark-brown damask; the  ponderous armchairs and sofa were upholstered in dark-brown velvet.</p>
<p>By the fireplace there was the secr&eacute;taire at which  Julian Wyllard had worked, the large shaded lamp which had lighted his evening  toil. Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein showed these things with pride. Nothing had been altered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a man of somewhat studious habits, like Mr.  Wyllard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I often work late into the night. This room is a  delightful room, for none of the noises of Paris penetrate here. The court is  very little used after dark &mdash; a passing footstep, perhaps, once in half an  hour. It is an almost monastic repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bed was in an alcove in a corner, entirely  shrouded by brown damask curtains like those which draped the windows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a door leading into the court, I see,&rdquo;  said Heathcote, whose keen eyes had scrutinised every feature of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you have perceived that!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr.  Bl&uuml;menlein, with marked surprise. &ldquo;I thought it was quite hidden by the  curtains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the top of the upper hinge is just visible  above the curtain-rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange! No one ever before noticed that door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a secret door, I suppose?&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. But it has never been used in my  time, and I doubt if Mr. Wyllard made much use of it,&rdquo; said Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein,  drawing back the curtain. &ldquo;The bed stood in his time just where it stands now,  with the head against the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bedstead is light enough to be moved easily if  the door were wanted,&rdquo; suggested Heathcote.</p>
<p>It was a small brass bedstead of English make. The  voluminous curtains made a kind of tent, independent of the bedstead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt it could,&rdquo; replied Bl&uuml;menlein, &ldquo;but I  fancy it could have been no more wanted in Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s time than it has been  in mine. It may have been made by some former inhabitant of these rooms, who  wanted free egress and ingress at any hour of the night, without exciting the  curiosity of the porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You conclude, then, that the door was an  after-thought,&rdquo; said Heathcote, &ldquo;and not in the original plan of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly. You will see how ruthlessly it has been  cut through dado and mouldings. An after-thought evidently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein pulled aside the bedstead and showed  Mr. Heathcote the door. It was a low narrow door, of plain oak, without  panelling or ornamentation of any kind. The fastening was a latch-lock, a  Bramah, with a small key, and a strong bolt secured the door on the inner side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A convenient door, no doubt,&rdquo; said Heathcote, &ldquo;for  a person of secret habits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora looked lingeringly round the room. Its gloom  oppressed her. The opaque windows, the tinted light from the upper sashes, the  sombre colouring, the heavy furniture &mdash; all contributed to that gloomy effect.  The only spot of brightness in the room was the writing-table, with its brass  fittings, its handsome brass lamp, and large green shade. There her husband sat  night after night, when the rest of Paris was gyrating in the whirlpool of  fashionable pleasure, light as autumn leaves dancing in the wind. There he had sat  brooding, calculating, plotting, striving onward, in the race for wealth. It  was for money he had toiled, and to make a great fortune &mdash; not for science, or  art, or fame &mdash; not to be useful or great &mdash; only to be rich. It seemed a sordid  life to look back upon &mdash; a wasted life even &mdash; and Dora thought regretfully of  those long evenings spent in this gloomy room. The idea of that monastic life  had no charm for her. She would rather have heard that her husband had been the  light of an intellectual circle &mdash; the favourite of fashion even. The picture of  these studious nights spent in brooding over the figures in a share-list, the  pages of a bank-book, chilled her soul.</p>
<p>And yet, in the maturity of his days, her husband  had seemed to her the most generous and high-minded of men, setting but little  value upon his wealth, caring nothing for money in the abstract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the least he has known how to use his fortune  nobly,&rdquo; she told herself, as she turned to leave that gloomy bedchamber. &ldquo;I,  who was born with good means, can hardly understand the eagerness of a  penniless young man to win fortune. It is a foolish idea of mine, after all,  that there is anything ignoble in working for riches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mrs. Wyllard, has your hero-worship been  satisfied? Have you seen enough of the temple which once enshrined your god?&rdquo;  said Heathcote lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been very much gratified; and I must  thank Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein for his kindness and consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The merchant protested that he had rarely enjoyed  so great a privilege as that which Mrs. Wyllard had afforded him; and with  exchange of courtesies they parted, on the threshold of the outer office.</p>
<p>Heathcote and Dora walked to the hotel together. It  was not a long walk, and it took them only by crowded streets and busy  thoroughfares, where anything like earnest conversation was impossible. And yet  Edward Heathcote could but remember that it was the first time they two had  walked together since Dora had been his plighted wife. Ah, how cruel a pang it  gave him to recall those old days, and to remember all she had been to him, all  she might have been, had Fate used him more kindly!</p>
<p>He stole a look at the beautiful face as they  walked slowly across the Place Vend&ocirc;me. Yes, she was no less lovely than of  old; her beauty had ripened, not changed. There was a more thoughtful look,  there were traces even of care and sorrow; but those indications only  heightened the spirituality of the face.</p>
<p>O, what worship, what devotion he could have given  her now in the bloom of her womanhood, in the maturity of his manhood &mdash; such  whole-hearted, thoughtful love as youth can never give! And it was not to be.  They were to be apart for ever, they two. They were to be strangers; since this  assumption of friendship, to which he had tried to reconcile himself, was, after  all, but a mockery. Chivalrous feeling might keep his thoughts pure, his honour  unspotted; but in his heart of hearts he loved his first love as passionately  as in the days of his youth.</p>
<p>And to-day, for the first time, he had heard her  husband address her coldly and curtly, with a touch of anger even.</p>
<p>He was not likely to forget that curt, impatient  tone, and the frown that had accentuated it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was very glad to get your letter,&rdquo; she said  presently. &ldquo;Tell me once more with your own lips that you have ceased to  suspect my cousin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ceased to suspect would, perhaps, be too strong an  expression. But in the discoveries I have made relating to that murdered girl  there is certainly nothing that in any way points to Mr. Grahame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would tell me all you have discovered &mdash;  how near you are to clearing up the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear I am still very far from that. It is the  history of a remote crime which occupies me at the present, and I hope in that  history of the past to find the clue to poor L&eacute;onie&rsquo;s death. I shall know more  in a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw my advertisement in the <em>Times</em>. If that advertisement be not  answered within a week, I shall conclude that the man who was to have met  L&eacute;onie Lemarque on the morning of July 5th has some part in the guilt of her  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it will be my business or Mr. Distin&rsquo;s  business to find that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the door of the hotel by this time,  and here Heathcote bade Dora adieu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again before you leave Paris, I  daresay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If Wyllard wants me he will know where to find me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not going home yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am likely to stay here some little time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And poor Hilda is longing to have you back at The  Spaniards. She will not see Bothwell while you are away. She is bound by the  promise you exacted from her. Their future home &mdash; everything is in abeyance  till you return,&rdquo; pleaded Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The home must remain in abeyance a little longer.  It is hard, no doubt; but when I go back I may be able to give Bothwell some  substantial help in the matter of that future home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will need only your sympathy and your advice.  He can manage everything else for himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. He has been helped already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell has always been to me as a brother and he  can never be poor while I am rich,&rdquo; answered Dora, as they shook hands.</p>
<p>Heathcote walked slowly back to the Boulevard,  thinking over this unexpected arrival of Mr. and Mrs. Wyllard in Paris. Why had  they come? That alleged reason of the picture-sale seemed rather more like an  excuse for a journey than a motive. True that Wyllard had been known to go up  to London on purpose to attend a sale at Christie &amp; Manson&rsquo;s, and there  might, therefore, be nothing extraordinary in his going still further on the  same errand. But it was strange that the picture-sale should coincide with  Heathcote&rsquo;s presence in Paris. Could it be Dora&rsquo;s eagerness to know the result  of his researches that had brought her and her husband to the Hotel Windsor?  Was her impatience the motive of the visit?</p>
<p>Hardly, he thought, for he knew the candour of her  nature, and he told himself that she would not have misrepresented the reason  of her journey. She had told him that the visit was a sudden whim of her  husband&rsquo;s, arising out of his passion for art.</p>
<p>Could it be that Julian Wyllard was so deeply  interested in the question of Bothwell&rsquo;s guilt or innocence as to make an  excuse for being on the scene of the investigation? He had seemed indifferent  almost to unkindness. He had wounded his wife&rsquo;s feelings by his coldness upon  this question. And now it seemed to Edward Heathcote that his real motive in  coming across the Channel must be to watch the case with his own eyes. His  manner to-day, when he inquired about Heathcote&rsquo;s progress, had been seemingly  careless: but beneath that apparent indifference the lawyer had noted a keen  expectancy, an intent watchfulness. Yes, it was something of deeper moment than  a picture-sale which had brought Julian Wyllard to Paris, posthaste, at a day&rsquo;s  notice. His angry manner to his wife an hour ago had indicated nervous  irritation, a mind on the rack.</p>
<p>Yet, looking at the question from a worldly point  of view &mdash; and Heathcote considered Wyllard essentially a man of the world &mdash;  there seemed but little reason why he should be deeply concerned as to whether  Bothwell was or was not suspected of foul play in the matter of the French  girl&rsquo;s death. The evidence against the young man was of far too slight and  vague a character to endanger his life or liberty. It was only just enough to  cast a cloud upon his reputation; and that his cousin&rsquo;s husband should put  himself out of the way on this account seemed to the last degree unlikely.  Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s life, judged as Heathcote judged it, was that of a man who had  lived exclusively for himself and his own happiness. An excellent husband to a  wife whom he adored, a good master, a liberal landlord; yet a man with whom  self had ever been paramount.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter16"></a>Chapter 16<br>
  A Face From The Grave</h2>
<p>A week passed. Julian Wyllard attended the sale at  the H&ocirc;tel Drouot, bought three of the smaller gems of the Rochejaquelin  gallery, and allowed the Raffaelle to pass into a national collection. His wife  and he had gone about Paris and its environs in the mean while; Dora very happy  in revisiting the spots she had admired in her youth.</p>
<p>The week had gone, and there had been no reply to  Heathcote&rsquo;s advertisement. But there had been a letter from Joseph Distin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last few days have not been entirely barren in  results,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s handbag has been found at the Charing  Cross Station; it was left in the waiting-room on the morning of the 5th July,  immediately after the arrival of the mail train from Dover. The bag is now in  my office. It contains some linen, marked L. L., slippers, brush, and comb; but  not a document of any kind. Nothing to afford the slightest clue to the girl&rsquo;s  business in London. The police have found a hansom-cabman who drove a tall,  gentlemanlike man and a French girl from Charing Cross to Paddington Station on  the morning of the 5th of July, in time for the Penzance train. They had no  luggage. The cabman believes that he should recognise the man if he saw him  again, but can give no clear description of his appearance, except that he was  a fine-looking man in the prime of life. He talked French to the girl, and the  cabman supposes him to have been a Frenchman. He and the girl appeared to be on  very good terms. The cabman saw them go into the Paddington Station together,  about five minutes before the starting of the train. The photograph of the dead  girl has been shown to this cabman, and he has identified it as the likeness of  the little French girl he drove in his cab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was all the progress that Joseph Distin&rsquo;s  agents had made at present. The facts looked dark against the man who had taken  L&eacute;onie Lemarque from station to station. If he had been innocent of all wrong  in relation to that helpless stranger, surely he would have replied to the  advertisement; he would have come forward to say what part he had taken in the  history of L&eacute;onie Lemarque.</p>
<p>Heathcote stopped the first advertisement, and  inserted a second worded thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Georges, who resided in Paris in the year  &rsquo;71, and for some years previously, or any friend of Monsieur Georges now  residing in England, is earnestly requested to communicate with Messrs. Distin  &amp; Son, Solicitors, Furnival&rsquo;s Inn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not much hope of getting a reply to this  advertisement, after the failure of the previous appeal, but he thought it was  well to advertise this name of Georges. Some insignificant person, some busybody  who had known the man Georges at some period of his existence, might reply; and  any information so obtained might form a link in the chain of that strange  story of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her mysterious lover.</p>
<p>Mysterious, Heathcote felt this man to have been, despite  Trottier&rsquo;s idea that he was only a rich American who lived a Bohemian life as a  matter of choice. It seemed to Heathcote as if there must have been some  stronger ground than mere whim for an existence so secluded, so exceptional,  spent in such a city as Paris, where the delight of the rich and the idle is to  spend their days and nights before the eyes of an admiring crowd, and to have  every movement and every caprice chronicled in the newspapers.</p>
<p>And this man had been in the prime of his manhood,  good-looking, clever, brilliant, the lover of a beautiful actress. Hardly the  kind of person to hide his light under a bushel, unless there was some strong  motive for concealment.</p>
<p>What could that motive be? Heathcote wondered, as  he brooded over the imperfect story of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her niece. Was this  Georges a swindler, who had come by his wealth in a criminal manner, and dared  not show himself in the light of day? Was he one of the many tricksters and  schemers of Paris, the birds of prey who live upon carrion, and who know  themselves the scorn of their fellow-men? or had he a wife from whose jealous  eye he was obliged to hide his devotion to Marie Pr&eacute;vol? Heathcote believed  that there must have been some guilty reason for the life which shrank from the  light of day.</p>
<p>He had been in Paris a fortnight, and he began to  ask himself how long this investigation to which he had pledged himself was  likely to last. At the beginning his progress had seemed rapid &mdash; triumphant  almost. Starting from utter ignorance of the name and position of the dead  girl, he had arrived in a few days at an exact knowledge of her name,  surroundings, and past history. Yet he was constrained to confess to himself  that, armed with all these facts, he was not one whit nearer to finding the man  who had murdered her. Given this history of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s childhood and  youth, it was still possible that Bothwell Grahame had thrown her out of the  railway-carriage.</p>
<p>The man who took her in a hansom from Charing Cross  to Paddington might have left her at the latter station. She might have gone  alone upon her way towards Penzance, to encounter a villain on the road, and  that villain might have been Bothwell Grahame. The thing was within the limits  of possibility; though in Heathcote&rsquo;s present mood it seemed to him altogether  unlikely. Yet firmly to establish the fact of Bothwell&rsquo;s innocence, he must  find the man who was guilty.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that the man who met L&eacute;onie  Lemarque at the station, who was known to have conducted her to another  station, had in a measure condemned himself by his silence. If he had not been  guiltily concerned in the girl&rsquo;s death, he would assuredly have replied to the  advertisement. He would have been apprised by that advertisement that some evil  had befallen L&eacute;onie Lemarque, and he would have been prompt to come forward and  tell all he knew of the girl who had been sent to him for aid, a friendless  orphan, a stranger in a strange land.</p>
<p>It seemed clear to Heathcote that Georges, the  murderer, was still living, still in dread of the gallows; and that the girl  who went to meet the friend of the murderer had fallen into a trap. The papers  she carried were doubtless of a compromising character; the girl herself was  the sole witness of the crime, the only living being who could recognise the  murderer. Papers and witness had disappeared together.</p>
<p>Heathcote was fond of Paris. It was not irksome to  him to stay there even in the dead season. He had the theatres for his evening  amusement; he had two or three friends who had not fled to the mountain or the  sea, and in whose drawing-rooms he was welcome. He had the National Library in  the Rue Richelieu for his club; and he had the ever-varying life of the  Boulevard for his recreation. Time therefore did not hang heavily on his hands;  and he knew that while he watched and waited in Paris, Joseph Distin would not  be idle in London. Every clue, were it the slightest, would be patiently  followed by that expert investigator.</p>
<p>In his saunterings in the Rue de Rivoli and on the  Boulevards Mr. Heathcote had hunted assiduously for a photograph of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol; but so fleeting is the fame of beauty, which leaves nothing behind it  save a tender memory, that for some time he had failed utterly in his quest.  Her name was hardly remembered by the people who sold photographs. And yet  twelve or thirteen years ago the portrait of Marie Pr&eacute;vol was in every  shop-window. It had been sold by thousands, had adorned every album in Paris  and Brussels, and had been hung over many a bachelor&rsquo;s mantelpiece, worshipped by  half the beardless boys in France and Belgium.</p>
<p>At last Heathcote lighted upon an elderly shopman,  who was a little more intelligent and had a much better memory than the men he  had encountered hitherto. The man perfectly remembered Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her photographs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a photograph of her by Nadar,&rdquo; he said&mdash; &ldquo;a  portrait that was the rage. It was soon after her first appearance at the Porte  Saint-Martin, and it was the costume in which she made her <em>d&eacute;but</em>. She was the Genius of Evil, in a black satin bodice and a  black tulle skirt starred with gold. The close-fitting black bodice set off her  graceful figure, and her superb shoulders, and her hair, which was positively  magnificent, fell down her back in a horse&rsquo;s tail. It was like a stream of  molten gold. I saw her in that character half a dozen times. All Paris rushed  to see her, though she was never much of an actress. Her beauty made her famous  all over Europe. We used to send her photographs to St. Petersburg. But there  is a fashion in these things; and I daresay almost every one of those  photographs has found its way to the rubbish-heap. If you call to-morrow I may  be able to supply you with what you want; but I shall have to hunt over a good  deal of our old stock to get at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be greatly obliged if you will do so,&rdquo;  answered Heathcote. &ldquo;I suppose Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol had the weakness of our  lovely ladies in England, and was fond of being photographed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first year or so, when she began to be  celebrated for her beauty, there were a good many different photographs of her  &mdash; in this costume and in that; and, you know, in those fairy spectacles every  handsome actress wears at least half a dozen costumes. But after that first  year there were no more of Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s photographs to be had for love  or money. Our firm applied to her, offered her a liberal royalty &mdash; five sous  upon every photograph &mdash; if she would sit to Nadar, in all her costumes, and  give us the sole privilege of selling her portraits. But she declined. She was  never going to sit again. She did not want herself vulgarised by having her  portrait sold for a franc to every <em>calicot</em> in France. Our firm felt insulted by her reply, which was given to one of our  principals, through an impertinent sempstress, who worked by the day for  Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol, and who almost shut the door in our principal&rsquo;s nose. Our  firm took the trouble to find out why Mademoiselle objected to the fame which  photography can alone bestow upon beauty; and we discovered that there was a  lover in the case &mdash; a mysterious lover; a man who kept himself curiously dark&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; exclaimed Heathcote. &ldquo;I will give you a  thousand francs for a photograph of that lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shopman shrugged his shoulders and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A liberal offer, Monsieur, and a very safe one.  Except that the man&rsquo;s name was Georges, I know nothing about him. The police  would have given me twice as much as you offer, for his photograph, if I could  have furnished them with one ten years ago, immediately after the murder of  Marie Pr&eacute;vol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then the man proceeded to relate the story of  the actress&rsquo;s death, and the impression which it made in Paris at the time.  Heathcote listened, and affected ignorance: for, even in these recollections,  there might be some detail to suggest a clue. There was nothing, however. The  man told the story as it had been told in the newspapers, and as it was already  known to Heathcote.</p>
<p>He went back to the shop on the following day, and  the shopman showed him three different photographs of Marie Pr&eacute;vol.</p>
<p>Two were of the carte de visite size, in costume.  They had both grown pale with age, and had an old-fashioned look. They were  full-length portraits, showing the perfection of an exquisite figure, as  displayed in the scanty drapery of a burlesque costume: a graceful girlish form,  delicately fashioned, a perfect face, small refined features, a head crowned  with masses of platted hair. But, in these small photographs, the soul was  wanting. Beyond the one fact, that the original was exquisitely lovely, they  revealed nothing.</p>
<p>The third was of cabinet size, and here the woman  herself appeared. Here, in the face of the photograph, Edward Heathcote looked  back across ten years, and saw the face of the living woman, the smile on the  lips, the light in the eyes. It was a head vignetted, the head only, carelessly  draped with a cloud of tulle, which framed the oval of the face and veiled the  rich masses of hair. It was an exquisite face, eyes large and dark and dreamy,  shadowed by long dark lashes, an expression of pensive tenderness about the  perfect lips, the nose small and straight, the chin delicately moulded. It was  not the bold bright beauty of an actress, accustomed to challenge the  admiration of the vulgar crowd; it was a beauty instinct with tender womanly  feeling, and serious thought, an essentially feminine loveliness; and its chief  characteristic was purity. It would have been impossible to associate such  loveliness with an evil life, a dissolute mind.</p>
<p>The colour of this larger photograph was almost as  good as if it had been taken yesterday: the portrait had a living look, which  struck Heathcote painfully. It was sad to think that lovely face had been lying  in the dust for years &mdash; that the sweet smile in those eyes was nothing more  than a memory.</p>
<p>He was to dine at the Windsor that evening &mdash; a  farewell dinner, since Julian Wyllard talked of leaving Paris next morning. He  wanted to take his wife to Switzerland, perhaps to the Italian lakes. Dora was  pleased at the idea of revisiting the scenes in which her honeymoon had been  spent. They seemed far away in a dim past, those days of early married life,  when all the world was decked in the vivid hues of hope and gladness. Her union  with Julian Wyllard had been a happy one, but there had been something wanting.  That lonely old house at Penmorval chilled her sometimes, with its silent  corridors, its empty rooms. It would have been so sweet to her to hear baby  feet pattering along those corridors &mdash; baby voices &mdash; that glad childish treble,  which is like the piping of young birds, in those spacious rooms. There were so  many rooms, there was so much vacant space in the old house which only children  could have filled. And now she told herself that the dream was past and done  with. She felt as if she were growing old, and that somehow, she knew not how,  she and her husband were further apart than they had been. It might be that the  disappointment of a childless union was preying upon his mind &mdash; that he felt  the burden of a great fortune for which he had toiled over-much in his youth,  renouncing every social pleasure, friendship, love, all things, only to heap up  wealth for which there should be no heir.</p>
<p>The dinner at the Windsor was bright and pleasant,  albeit Heathcote was the only guest. Julian Wyllard was in excellent spirits,  full of plans for making the most of the bright weather in Switzerland. Dora  was pleased at his gaiety. She had been going about a good deal with him,  revisiting all the places she had seen with her mother &mdash; the churches, the  galleries, the law-courts, that brand-new Palais de Justice, so splendid, so  imposing, so uninteresting. They had been to Versailles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you go to Saint-Germain?&rdquo; asked Heathcote.  &ldquo;There is not much to see in the chateau where poor old James Stuart shed the  light of exiled royalty; but the old town, and the terrace, and the forest are  delightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; we did not go to Saint-Germain. We had  arranged to go yesterday, but Julian mistook the time at which the train  started, and we reached the station too late for the only train that would have  suited us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have never been to Saint-Germain?&rdquo; asked  Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes; I was there with my mother years ago,&rdquo;  answered Dora. &ldquo;We stayed at the Henri Quatre for a week. I have ridden and  rambled all over the forest. I was charmed with the place. I should like to  have gone there again with Julian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There may be time when we return from  Switzerland,&rdquo; said her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not delay your journey for a day, and let us  all go to Saint-Germain to-morrow?&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Suppose you dine with me  at the Henri Quatre. I have a morbid interest in that hotel, and in the  forest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! But why?&rdquo; asked Dora.</p>
<p>Instead of any verbal answer, Heathcote took from  his pocket the photograph of Marie Pr&eacute;vol, and handed it to Mrs. Wyllard. She  and her husband looked at it together. She had drawn closer to him after  dinner, as they sat at the small round table, and now they were sitting side by  side, like lovers.</p>
<p>There was a silence as they looked at the portrait.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an exquisite face!&rdquo; exclaimed Dora at last.  &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw lovelier eyes or a sweeter expression. Who is the  original? Do you know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has been dead ten years. I never saw her,&rdquo;  answered Heathcote gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what has this portrait to do with your morbid  interest in the forest of Saint-Germain?&rdquo; asked Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the likeness of a woman who was cruelly  murdered there just ten years ago. She was an actress known as Marie Pr&eacute;vol.  The murder made a great sensation at the time. You must have heard of it, Mr.  Wyllard; for I think you were a resident in Paris in &rsquo;71?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a resident in Paris till &rsquo;73. Yes, I  perfectly remember the murder of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her admirer. But it was one  of those crimes which do not excite any deep or lasting interest. The case was  too common, the motive too obvious. An outbreak of jealous fury on the part of  a jilted lover. Had the murderer and his victims belonged to the working  classes, society would scarcely have heard of the crime, certainly would have  taken no notice of it. But because she was an actress and her admirer a man of  fashion, there was a fuss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do not consider such a murder  interesting?&rdquo; asked Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; replied Wyllard. &ldquo;To be  interesting a murder must be mysterious. Here there was no mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me. I think you must have forgotten the  details of the story. There was a mystery, and a profound one; but that mystery  was the character of the man Georges, who was known to have been Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s  devoted lover, and who was by some supposed to have been her husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I remember,&rdquo; answered Wyllard. &ldquo;These  things come back to one&rsquo;s mind as one discusses them. Georges was the name of  the supposed murderer. He got off so cleverly as to baffle the keenest police  in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know any thing of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. He was a nobody, I believe. A man of  ample means, but of no social standing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His life was a social mystery; and it is in that  mysterious existence that I find an interest surpassing anything I have  hitherto met with in the history of crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; exclaimed Julian Wyllard, with something  of a sneer in his tone. &ldquo;I perceive you have begun the business of amateur  detective on a large scale. I understood from Dora that you were coming to  Paris solely with a view to finding out anything there was to be discovered about  that poor little girl who tumbled off the viaduct, and whom, I think, you call  Louise Lemarque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;onie Lemarque. That was the girl&rsquo;s name. L&eacute;onie  Lemarque&rsquo;s death is only the last link in a chain of events beginning with the  murder of Marie Pr&eacute;vol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard started impatiently from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Heathcote, I thought you the most sensible  man I ever met, but really this sounds like rank lunacy. What in Heaven&rsquo;s name  can the murder at Saint-Germain ten years ago have to do with the death of that  girl the other day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this much. L&eacute;onie Lemarque was Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s  niece: and I have the strongest reason for believing that she went to London to  meet the murderer of her aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter17"></a>Chapter 17<br>
  Struck Down</h2>
<p>As Edward Heathcote uttered those words, the  conviction of their truth flashed into his mind. In thoughtful days and wakeful  nights this question as to the identity of the person who was to meet L&eacute;onie  Lemarque at the railway-station had been a perplexity to him, the subject of  many a new theory: and now it came upon him all at once that this assertion,  which he had made on the spur of the moment, in the heat of argument, was the  true solution of the mystery.</p>
<p>It was to Georges himself &mdash; her daughter&rsquo;s generous  adoring lover, her daughter&rsquo;s suspected murderer &mdash; that Madame Lemarque had  sent her granddaughter, as to one who, of all other men, would be most inclined  to act generously to the orphan girl, were it only in remorse for his crime.</p>
<p>He tried to realise the thoughts of the lonely old  woman, dying in penury, leaving her orphan grandchild to face the world without  a friend. She would go over the list of those whom she had known in the past &mdash;  those who were rich enough to be generous. Alas! how few there are who remain  the friends of poverty! One man she had known of, although she had never seen  him &mdash; rich, generous to lavishness. She had at one time believed him to be the  murderer of her daughter. But it might be that she had afterwards modified her  opinion, that she had received some communication from this Georges, that he  had assured her of his innocence, that he had sent her money, had helped her to  struggle on against adverse times, had helped her for a while, and then grown  weary. And she, knowing the place of his exile, had, in her desperation,  determined upon committing her grandchild to this man&rsquo;s care; rather than to  the pitiless world of strange faces and careless hearts, the outside world, to  which one helpless girl the more is but as one drop in the ocean of sorrowing  humanity. She had sent L&eacute;onie Lemarque to meet this man, and the girl had  recognised the murderer of her aunt.</p>
<p>And yet this could hardly be, since the cabman&rsquo;s  evidence showed that L&eacute;onie had been on the best possible terms with the person  in whose company she drove to Paddington Station.</p>
<p>After that speech of his, Edward Heathcote had no  longer the power to withhold any details of his investigation from Julian  Wyllard and his wife. He told them in fewest words all that he had discovered  since he crossed the Channel.</p>
<p>Dora was intensely interested in the story. The  passionate love and passionate jealousy were very human feelings that appealed  to her womanly tenderness. She could not withhold her pity from the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange that, in all your Parisian experience, you  never met this Monsieur Georges,&rdquo; she said to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, since I seldom went out in the evening;  while this man was evidently a thorough Bohemian, who only began to live after  midnight,&rdquo; answered Wyllard.</p>
<p>He was sitting in a thoughtful attitude, his elbow  on the table, his chin leaning on his hand, and that photograph of Marie Pr&eacute;vol  lying before him. He was looking intently at it, perusing every lineament.</p>
<p>Presently he raised his eyes, slowly, thoughtfully,  from the photograph to the face of his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Heathcote, &ldquo;I know what you are  thinking. There <em>is</em> a likeness. It  struck me this evening when I came into this room. There is a curious likeness  between the face of the living and the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That morning, on studying the countenance in the  photograph, Heathcote had been perplexed &mdash; worried, even &mdash; by a sense of  familiarity in that face of the dead. It smiled at him as a face he had known  of old &mdash; a face out of the past. Yet it was only in the evening, when he came  into the <em>salon</em> at the Windsor, and  Mrs. Wyllard turned towards him in the lamplight, that he knew what the  likeness meant. It was not an obvious or striking likeness. The resemblance was  rather in expression than in feature, but one face recalled the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is a likeness,&rdquo; said Wyllard coldly,  passing the photograph back to its owner, who rose to take leave, just as the  clock on the mantelpiece struck eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall look in to-morrow, and see if you are  inclined for an afternoon at Saint-Germain,&rdquo; he said, as he shook hands with  Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but your invitation  is no longer tempting. You have spoiled my interest in that sweet old place. I  shall always think of it as the scene of Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely that is an additional charm,&rdquo; said Wyllard  mockingly. &ldquo;If you are gifted with Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s detective temper &mdash; the  genius of the heaven-born police-officer &mdash; Saint-Germain will be all the more  interesting to you on account of a double murder &mdash; and perhaps a suicide into  the bargain; for it is not unlikely that the murderer&rsquo;s bones are mouldering in  some gravel-pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget Drubarde&rsquo;s story of the  travelling-cap,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a shrewd hypothesis on your  ex-police-officer&rsquo;s part, but it is by no means conclusive evidence,&rdquo; answered  Wyllard.</p>
<p>Heathcote called at the Windsor upon the following  afternoon, to inquire if Mr. and Mrs. Wyllard had left for Switzerland. He was  shocked to hear that Mr. Wyllard had been taken seriously ill in the night, and  that there had been two medical men with him that morning. Madame was terribly  distressed, the waiter told him, but she bore up admirably.</p>
<p>Heathcote sent in his name, and was at once  admitted to the <em>salon</em>, where Dora  came to him after the briefest delay.</p>
<p>She was very pale, and there were signs of terror,  and of grief in her countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have come,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I should  have sent for you, only&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated, and stopped, with tears in her eyes,  feeling that in another moment she might have said too much. He was her oldest  friend, the man to whom her thoughts turned naturally in the hour of trouble,  the man whom, of all others, she most trusted; but he was her old lover also,  and she felt that never again could she dare to appeal to his friendship as she  had done for Bothwell&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything very serious?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very serious. Paralysis. Only a slight  attack, the doctors say. But there are signs of a physical decay which may end  fatally &mdash; an overworked nervous system, the English physician says. And yet his  life has been so easy, so placid, for the last seven years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt; but his life in this city was a life of  excitement and anxiety, the fever of the race for wealth. He is suffering now,  most likely, for the high pressure of that period. Is his mind affected by the  shock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least. His mind was never clearer than  it has been to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did the illness begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early this morning, five hours after you left us.  We sat up till nearly one o&rsquo;clock, talking of our trip to Switzerland and  Italy. Julian was in wonderful spirits. I have never known him more cheerful.  He planned a tour that would last all through the winter, as I told him. It was  one o&rsquo;clock when I went to bed, and I left him sitting in his dressing-room,  reading. The door was half open, and I could see him, as he sat by the table,  in the bright light of the lamp. I had slept for hours, as it seemed to me,  when I was awakened by hearing my name called in a strange voice. I sprang out  of bed; frightened by that unknown voice, and then I heard the name again, and  knew all at once that it was Julian&rsquo;s voice, only altered beyond recognition. I  rushed to him. He had sunk back into his armchair. I asked him what was the  matter, and he told me that he could not move. There was numbness in all his  limbs. His arms were as heavy as lead. I seized his hand and found it deadly  cold. I rang the bell with all my might, and at last one of the women-servants  came to my help. She roused the porter, and sent him to fetch a doctor. It was  not quite four o&rsquo;clock when she came to me, but it was past five o&rsquo;clock before  the doctor arrived. He told me at once that my husband had had a paralytic  shock, and he helped me to get him to bed, while the porter went in search of a  nurse. I wanted to have nursed Julian myself, without the help of any stranger,  whose presence might worry him: but the doctor said that would be impossible. I  must have a skilled nurse in attendance. There would be plenty for me to do in  helping her, he said. So I submitted, and the nurse was with us in less than an  hour &mdash; a nursing-sister of the order of St. Vincent de Paul, a very nice  person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is your doctor a clever man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Frenchman who came in the morning seems  clever; and, at my request, he brought Dr. Danvers, an English physician. I am  told he is the best English doctor in Paris. They are both of the same opinion  as to the nature of the attack; but Dr. Danvers is inclined to look upon it  more seriously than the French doctor. He declared that Julian&rsquo;s brain must  have been frightfully overworked within the last few years; and when I told him  that my husband&rsquo;s life had, to my knowledge, been one of rest and tranquil  monotony, I could see by his face that he did not believe me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Wyllard is better, I hope, since the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he is much better. There is still a feeling  of heaviness and dull pain; but he is so patient, he will hardly confess he is  in pain, though I can see from his face that he suffers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears rushed to her eyes, and she walked  hastily to the window, where she stood for a few minutes holding her  handkerchief before her face, with her back to Heathcote, who waited silently,  knowing the uselessness of all consolatory speeches at such a time.</p>
<p>She conquered herself, and came back to her seat  presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struck down in the prime of his manhood, in all  the force of his intellect,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is a deathblow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your English doctor may exaggerate the danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God grant that it is so. I have telegraphed to Sir  William Spencer, entreating him to come to Paris by to-night&rsquo;s mail. The  question of cost is nothing; but I fear he may not be able to leave his  practice so long &mdash; or he may be away from London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you telegraph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An hour ago. I am expecting the answer at any  moment. I hope he will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it this Dr. Danvers apprehends?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fears an affection of the spinal marrow, a slow  and lingering malady, full of pain. O, it is too dreadful!&rdquo; cried the agonised  wife, clasping her hands in a paroxysm of despair. &ldquo;What has he done to be so  afflicted? how has he deserved such suffering, he who worked so hard, and  denied himself all pleasures in his youth &mdash; he who has been so good and  generous to others? Why should he be tortured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Mrs. Wyllard, pray do not give way to grief.  The doctor may be mistaken. He ought not to have told you so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was right of him to tell me. I begged him to  keep nothing from me &mdash; not to treat me as a child. If there is a martyrdom to  be borne, I will bear my part of it. Yes, I will suffer with him, pang for pang,  for to see him in pain will be as sharp an agony for me as the actual torture  can be for him. He is resting now, dozing from the effect of the morphia which  they have injected under the skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust if Sir William Spencer come that he will  be able to give you a more hopeful opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am putting my trust in that. But I am full  of fear. Dr. Danvers has such a shrewd clever air. He does not look the kind of  man to be mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in these nervous disorders there is always  room for error. You must hope for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try to hope, for Julian&rsquo;s sake. Goodbye. I  must go back to my place at his bedside. I don&rsquo;t want him to see a strange face  when he awakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye. Remember, if there is any service I can  render you, the slightest or the greatest, you have only to command me. I shall  call this evening to hear how your patient progresses, and if Spencer is  coming. But I shall not ask to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the hotel full of trouble at the agony of  one he loved. He thought of Dora in her helplessness, her loneliness, watching  the slow decay of that vigorous frame, the gradual extinction of that powerful  mind. What martyrdom could be more terrible for a tender-hearted woman?</p>
<p>He called at the Windsor in the evening. The  patient was much the same. Sir William Spencer was expected at eight o&rsquo;clock  next morning.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote was watching in front of the hotel  when the physician drove up in a fly from the station. Dr. Danvers had gone  into the hotel a few minutes before. Heathcote waited to see Sir William  Spencer leave the hotel in the same fly, accompanied to the carriage door by  Dr. Danvers. They were talking as they came out of the <em>porte-coch&egrave;re</em>, and their faces were very grave. Heathcote felt that  the great English doctor had not left hope behind him in those rooms on the  first floor, with their sunny windows facing the palace-garden. He had not the  heart to intrude upon Dora immediately after the consultation, though he was  very anxious to hear Sir William&rsquo;s verdict. He watched the fly drive away,  while Dr. Danvers walked briskly in the opposite direction: and then he  strolled along the Rue de Rivoli towards the Palais Royal, hardly knowing where  he went, so deeply were his thoughts occupied by the grief of the woman he  loved.</p>
<p>What if Julian Wyllard were to die, that successful  rival of his, the man who had stolen his plighted wife from him? The thought  would come, though Heathcote tried to shut his mind against it, though he hated  himself for harbouring so selfish an idea. The question would shape itself in  his mind, would be answered somehow or other.</p>
<p>If Julian Wyllard were to die, and Dora were again  free to wed whom she chose? Would the old love be rekindled in her heart? Would  the old lover seem nearer and dearer to her than any other man on earth? Would  she reward him for long years of patient devotion, for a faithfulness that had  never wavered? Alas, no, he could hope for no such reward, he who had married  within a year or two of losing her, who had, in the world&rsquo;s eye, consoled  himself speedily for that loss. Could he go to her and say, &ldquo;I never loved my  wife; I married her out of pity; my love was given to you, and you alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was his secret. To Dora Wyllard he must have  seemed as fickle as the common herd of men, who change their loves as easily as  they change their tailors. He could put forward no claim for past constancy.  No, were she once again free, it would be by the devotion of the future that he  must win her.</p>
<p>And then he recalled what the physician had said  about Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s malady. It would be a slow and lingering disease &mdash; a  decay of years, perhaps. He saw the dark possibility of such a martyrdom.  Dora&rsquo;s life would be worn and wasted in the attendance upon that decaying  frame, that sorely tried mind and temper. She would sacrifice health, spirits,  life itself, perhaps, in her devotion to her afflicted husband. And when the  end at last came &mdash; the dismal end of all her care and tenderness &mdash; would she be  a woman to be wooed and won? Would not life for her be over, all possibility of  happiness for ever gone? Only a little respite, a little rest remaining before  the grave should close on her broken heart.</p>
<p>No, there was no ground for selfish rejoicing, for  wicked hope, in Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s malady.</p>
<p>Heathcote ordered a simple breakfast in one of the  quietest caf&eacute;s in the Palais Royal, and lingered over the meal and the  newspapers till he was able to present himself with a better grace at the  Windsor. He had some difficulty in reading the news of the day with attention,  or even comprehension, so full were his thoughts. He recalled Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s  manner and bearing during the last few months, and wondered at the vigour, the  freshness of mind, the power which had been so obvious in every look, and tone,  and gesture. That such a man could suddenly be struck down without a day&rsquo;s  warning, without any imaginable cause, had seemed almost incomprehensible. Had  the nature of the attack been different, the thing would have appeared less  inexplicable. An apoplectic fit striking down the strong man in his might, as  if from the blow of a Nasmyth hammer, would have seemed far more in character  with the nature of the patient, his vigorous manhood, his appearance of  physical power.</p>
<p>Heathcote called at the Windsor between twelve and  one o&rsquo;clock, and had only a few minutes to wait in the <em>salon</em> before he was joined by Mrs. Wyllard.</p>
<p>She was very pale, but she was more composed than  on the previous day. Her countenance had a rigid look, Heathcote thought; as if  she had schooled herself to composure by a severe mental effort. The hand she  gave him was deadly cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you have good news for me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Is  Spencer more hopeful than your Paris physician?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no hope. I had a long talk with both  the doctors after their consultation. It was very difficult to wring the truth  from them both &mdash; to get them to be quite candid. They seemed to pity me so  much. They were full of kindness. As if kindness or pity would help me in my  trouble for <em>him!</em> Nothing can help me  &mdash; no one &mdash; except God. And perhaps He will not. It seems that in this life  there are a certain number of victims, chosen haphazard, who must suffer  mysterious, purposeless agonies. And Julian is to be one of those sufferers. It  is bitter, inexplicable, cruel. My soul revolts against these fruitless  punishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what Sir William said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst. Julian&rsquo;s symptoms indicate a disease of  the spinal cord: progressive muscular atrophy, Sir William called it, a disease  generally caused by excessive muscular activity, but in this case due to the  strain upon the mind. He will waste away inch by inch, hour by hour, and he  will suffer terribly. Yes, that is the worst. This gradual decay will be a long  martyrdom. He will be dependent on opiates for relief. I am to take comfort in  the thought that his pain can be soothed by repeated injections of morphia;  that a sleeping draught will give him a little rest at night. He is to exist  under the influence of narcotics; he who a few months ago seemed the  incarnation of health and vigour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A few months ago, you say. Then you have remarked  a change in him of late?&rdquo; inquired Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there has been a change, subtle, mysterious.  I could not describe the symptoms to Sir William Spencer. But there was a  curious alteration in his ways and manner. He was much more irritable. He had  strange intervals of silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you recall the beginning of this alteration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly. It was a change that seems to have had no  beginning. It was so gradual &mdash; imperceptible almost. It was during that very  oppressive weather early in August that I noticed he was looking ill and  haggard. I thought that he was angry and worried about Bothwell, and that he  was vexed at the stupidity of his bailiff, who had mismanaged one of the farms,  and involved him in a law-suit with a tenant. I fancied these things were  worrying him, and that the excessive heat was making him ill. I begged him to  take medical advice; but he was angry at the suggestion, and declared that he  never felt better in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Sir William advise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we should go back to Penmorval at once, or at  least as soon as the proper arrangements can be made for the journey. I have  telegraphed to Julian&rsquo;s valet to come here immediately, and Sir William will  send a trained nurse from London by the evening mail. We shall have plenty of  help. Fortunately it is Julian&rsquo;s own wish to go back to Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any improvement in his state today?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare not say there is improvement. He is very  calm, quite resigned. The physicians told him the nature of his malady; but  they did not tell him that it is hopeless. They left his own intelligence to  discover that; and I fear he knows the truth only too well already. Would you  like to see him, if he is inclined to receive you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I should much like to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora went into the adjoining room, and closed the  door behind her. She reopened it almost immediately, and beckoned to Heathcote,  who went in with careful footstep and bated breath, almost as he might have  entered the chamber of death.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard was reclining on a sofa, his head  and shoulders propped up by pillows, his legs covered with a fur rug. There was  something in the very position of the body, so straight, so rigid a line from  the waist downwards, which told of that death in life that had fallen upon the  strong man; the man whom Edward Heathcote had last seen erect, in all the  vigour of manhood, tall, broad-shouldered, powerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Heathcote, you have come to see the wreck of  proud humanity,&rdquo; he said, with a half-sad, half-cynical smile. &ldquo;You did not  know when you were with us the other night that my race was so nearly run, that  I was to break down in the middle of the course. I have had my warnings, but I  made light of them, and the blow came unexpectedly at last. But it has left the  brain clear. That is some comfort. Sit down; I want to talk to you &mdash; and Dora &mdash;  seriously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was very pale &mdash; white even to the lips, and his  wife was watching him anxiously, surprised at the signs of profound agitation  in him who had been so calm after the physicians had left him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for you, Wyllard; sorry with all  my heart,&rdquo; said Heathcote earnestly, as he took the chair nearest the sofa,  while Dora seated herself on the other side, close to her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are more than good. I am assured that everybody  will &mdash; pity me,&rdquo; this with a smile of bitterest meaning. &ldquo;But I want to talk to  you about two people in whom you and Dora are both interested &mdash; your very  lovable sister, and my wife&rsquo;s scapegrace cousin. They are devoted to each  other; it seems, and except for this little cloud upon Bothwell&rsquo;s character, I  take it you had no objection to the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my chief objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me for saying that it was a most foolish  one. Because a few country bumpkins take it into their heads to suspect a  gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Mr. Wyllard, if I confess that I was  among those bumpkins. Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s refusal to answer Mr. Distin&rsquo;s questions,  and his obvious agitation, led me to believe that he was concerned in that  girl&rsquo;s death. I am thankful to be able to say that my discoveries on this side  of the Channel all point in a different direction, while on the other hand my  sister assures me that her lover has satisfactorily explained the reason of his  peculiar conduct at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no further objection to Bothwell as a  husband for your sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my esteem for the race from which he sprang is  a strong reason why I should sanction the match; although worldly wisdom is  decidedly against a girl&rsquo;s marriage with a man who was a soldier, and who is &mdash;  nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be our business &mdash; Dora&rsquo;s and mine &mdash; to  reconcile worldly wisdom and foolish love. My wife tells me that her cousin has  turned over a new leaf &mdash; that he has schemed out a new career, and has set to  work with a wonderful amount of energy &mdash; just that strong purpose which has  been lacking in him hitherto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard as much, and a good deal more than  this, from my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, my dear Heathcote, all I need add is  that means shall not be wanting to my wife&rsquo;s kinsman to enable him to carry out  the scheme of life which he has made for himself, comfortably and creditably.  Dora and I are both rich. We have no children. We can afford to be generous in  the present; and those we love must naturally profit by our wealth in the  future. Dora&rsquo;s fortune will, in all likelihood, go to Bothwell&rsquo;s children. In a  word, your sister is not asked to marry a pauper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never thought of the question from a  financial standpoint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it must be not the less agreeable to you to  know that the financial aspect is satisfactory,&rdquo; answered Wyllard. &ldquo;And now  what is to hinder a speedy marriage? It is my wife&rsquo;s wish, Bothwell&rsquo;s wish,  mine, everybody&rsquo;s, so far as I can understand, except yours. You are the only  hindrance. Heathcote, I want to see Bothwell and Hilda married before I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian!&rdquo; cried his wife, with a stifled sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O my dearest, I am not going to leave you yet  awhile,&rdquo; answered her husband, clasping her hand, and raising it to his lips  with infinite tenderness. &ldquo;My doctors promise me a slow deliverance. But when a  man has begun to die, were it never so gradually, it is time for him to set his  house in order. I should like to see Bothwell and Hilda married in Bodmin  Church, before the eyes of the people who have maligned my wife&rsquo;s kinsman. I  should like the wedding to take place as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure Hilda&rsquo;s brother will not refuse your  request,&rdquo; said Dora, with a pleading look at Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Hilda and her lover can fulfil their own scheme  of happiness by a speedy marriage, I will not be a stumbling-block,&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>After this they talked for a little while on  indifferent subjects, and of the journey back to Cornwall &mdash; that tedious  journey of a helpless invalid which would be so different from any previous  experience of Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s. He spoke of it lightly enough, affecting a  philosophical disdain for the changes and chances of this little life: but  Heathcote marked the quiver of his lip, the look of pain, which neither pride  nor stoicism could suppress.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a hard thing for such a man, in the  very prime of life, handsome, clever, prosperous, to be so struck down: and it  could but be said that Julian Wyllard carried himself firmly under the trial.</p>
<p>Heathcote and Dora parted sorrowfully outside the  sick-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not good of him to wish to see Bothwell&rsquo;s  happiness secured?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of him to think of any one except  himself at such a moment,&rdquo; answered Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad he has won your consent to an early  marriage. And now that you have given that consent &mdash; now that we are all  assured of the folly of any suspicion pointing at Bothwell &mdash; I conclude that  you will trouble yourself no more about the mystery of that poor girl&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are mistaken. I shall go on with my  investigation, in the cause of justice. Besides, Bothwell&rsquo;s character can never  be thoroughly rehabilitated till the real criminal is found; and, for a third  reason, I am interested in this strange story as a work of art. Good-bye, Mrs.  Wyllard; if I can be of any use to you to-morrow in helping to move your  invalid, pray send for me. If not, I suppose we shall not meet till I call on  you at Penmorval. I leave the business of Hilda&rsquo;s marriage to your discretion.  She cannot have a better adviser than you, and whatever plans you make I shall  sanction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the hotel and strolled slowly towards the  Madeleine, hardly knowing what he should do with the rest of his day. He had an  appointment with Sigismond Trottier in the evening. That gentleman and he were  to meet at the Gymnase at the first performance of a new play, and they were to  sup at Vachette&rsquo;s afterwards, when Heathcote was to hear any fresh facts that  the paragraphist might have gathered for him relating to the mysterious Georges  and the once celebrated Mdlle. Pr&eacute;vol. Trottier had promised to hunt up the few  men who had been intimate with Georges, and to get all the information he could  from them.</p>
<p>In front of the Madeleine Heathcote was overtaken  by that good-natured merchant, Gustav Bl&uuml;menlein, who had felt so much pleasure  in showing his apartments to Mrs. Wyllard. They walked on together for a short  distance, in the direction of the Bl&uuml;menlein establishment, and Heathcote told  the merchant of his predecessor&rsquo;s sudden illness.</p>
<p>Monsieur Bl&uuml;menlein was interested and sympathetic,  and as they were now in front of his office, he insisted upon Mr. Heathcote  going in to smoke a cigarette, or share a bottle of Lafitte with him. Heathcote  refused the Lafitte, but accepted the cigarette, not sorry to find an excuse for  revisiting his rival&rsquo;s old abode. He blamed himself for this curiosity about  Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s youth, as an unworthy and petty feeling: yet, he could not  resist the temptation to gratify that curiosity which chance had thrown in his  way.</p>
<p>They went through the offices, where clerks were  working at their ledgers, and warehousemen hurrying in and out, and passed into  the library &mdash; that handsome and somewhat luxurious apartment, which remained in  all things, save the books upon the shelves, exactly as Julian Wyllard had left  it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know him twenty years ago?&rdquo; asked  Bl&uuml;menlein, after they had talked of the late tenant, and his successful career  in Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never saw him till just before his marriage,  about seven years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then you did not know him as a young man. I  have a photograph of him in that drawer, yonder,&rdquo; pointing to a writing-table  by the fireplace, &ldquo;taken fifteen years ago, when he was beginning to make his  fortune; when the Cr&eacute;dit Mauresque was at the height of its popularity. It went  to smash afterwards, as, no doubt, you know; but Wyllard contrived to get out  of it with clean hands &mdash; only just contrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that his part of the transaction  was open to doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, on the Bourse, during the Empire,  everything was, more or less, open to doubt. There were only two irrefragable  facts in the financial world of that time. There was a great deal of money  made, and a great deal of money lost. Mr. Wyllard was a very clever man, and he  contrived to be from first to last on the winning side. Nobody ever brought any  charge of foul play against him; and, in this matter, he was luckier, or  cleverer, than the majority of his compeers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see that photograph of which you  spoke just now,&rdquo; said Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see it. A clever face, a remarkable  face, I take it,&rdquo; answered Bl&uuml;menlein, unlocking a drawer, and producing a  photograph.</p>
<p>Yes, it was a fine head, a powerful head, instinct  with wondrous vitality, with the energy of a man bound to dominate others, in  any sphere of life; a master of whatever craft he practised. It was not the  face of abstract intellect. The white, cold light of the student did not  illumine those eyes, nor did the calm of the student&rsquo;s tranquil temper inform  the mouth. There was passion in the face; strongest human feelings were  expressed there; the love of love, the hate of hate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a marvellous face for a money-grubber,&rdquo;  exclaimed Heathcote, &ldquo;an extraordinary countenance for a man who could shut  himself from all the charms of the world, such a world as the Second Empire &mdash; a  man who could be indifferent to art, beauty, wit, music, social pleasures of  all kinds, and live only for his cash-box and bank-book. Difficult to reconcile  this face with the life which we are told Wyllard led in these rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is more than difficult,&rdquo; said Bl&uuml;menlein; &ldquo;it  is, to my mind, impossible to believe in so monstrous an anomaly as that sordid  life endured for nearly ten years by such a temperament as that which the  photograph indicates. I am something of a physiognomist, and I think I know  what that face means; if faces have any meaning whatever. It means strong  feeling, a fervid imagination, a mind that could not be satisfied with the  triumphs of successful finance. It means a nature in which the heart must have  fair play. Whatever Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s life may have appeared in the eyes of the  men with whom he had business relations &mdash; however he may have contrived to pass  for the serious genius of finance, old before his time, the embodiment of  abstruse calculations and far-seeing policy &mdash; be sure that the life was not a  barren life, and that fiery passions were factors in the sum of that  existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But his life seems to have been patent to all the  world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Heathcote, the life he led in public. But  who knows how he may have plunged into the dissipations of Paris after office  hours? That little door in the alcove has its significance, you may be sure. I  made light of it in Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s presence, for I know that women are jealous  even of the past. Why should I deprive her of the pleasure of considering her  husband a model of propriety, in the remote past as well as in the present? I  affected &mdash; for that dear lady&rsquo;s sake &mdash; to believe the side door the work of a  prior tenant to Mr. Wyllard. But I happen to have documentary evidence that Mr.  Wyllard had the door made for him in the third year of his tenancy. I found the  receipted account of the builder who made it, among some papers left by my  predecessor at the back of a cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you think that Wyllard was a man with two  faces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; replied Bl&uuml;menlein: &ldquo;I think that Wyllard,  the speculator and financier, was one man &mdash; but that there was another man of  whose life the world knew nothing, and who went out and came in between dusk  and dawn by that side door in the court.&rdquo;</p>

  The General Receives A Summons</h2>
<p>While Bothwell was working out the scheme of an  industrious unpretentious life, to be spent with the woman he loved on that  wild Cornish coast on which he had been reared, and which was to him as a  passion, Lady Valeria Harborough was shining in the county and military society  within twenty miles of Plymouth &mdash; admired, envied, to outward seeming the most  fortunate of women. She went everywhere, she received every one worth  receiving. She had brought something of the easy manners, the unceremonious  gaiety, of Simla to her Devonshire villa. Her afternoon parties were the  liveliest in the neighbourhood. Her weekly musical evenings were the rage. She  engaged the best professional talent obtainable for these evenings. She rigidly  eschewed the amateur element. She selected music and songs with an  extraordinary tact, and contrived that no hackneyed composition should be ever  heard at her parties. The newest ballads, the last successes in modern classical  music, were first revealed to county society at Fox Hill. There people heard  the gavotte that was going to be fashionable, the song that was to be the rage  next season. And on these evenings, when the flowery corridors and the long  suite of rooms were filled with guests, when the spacious music-room, with its  two grand pianos and magnificent organ, was thrown open to the crowd, Lady  Valeria circulated amidst the throng, a queen among women, not so beautiful as  the fairest of her guests, but by far the most attractive of them all. There  was a subtle charm in those dreamy eyes and in that languid smile. Beardless  subalterns worshipped her as if she had been a goddess; and many a man, who  could hardly have been included in Lady Valeria&rsquo;s list of &ldquo;nice boys,&rdquo; felt his  heart beat faster as she lingered by his side for a few minutes. She had a  smile and a word for every one who crossed her threshold; the most  insignificant guest was greeted and remembered. She seemed a woman who lived  only for society, who had fulfilled her mission when she had been admired. The  General was proud of his young wife&rsquo;s success, delighted that his house should  be known as the pleasantest in the county. He could afford that money should be  spent as if it were water. He never complained of the expenses of his  establishment, but he knew the cost of everything, and paid all accounts with  his own cheques. Unluckily for Lady Valeria, old habits of strict accountancy,  acquired in the early days when he was adjutant of his regiment, had clung to  him. He liked accounts, and was in some measure his own house-steward. There  was no possibility of Lady Valeria&rsquo;s gambling debts being paid out of the  domestic funds. Everything was done on a large scale, but by line and rule. A  royal household could not have been managed more rigidly. Thus it was that Lady  Valeria&rsquo;s money difficulties were very real difficulties; and it was only by a  full confession of her folly that she could have obtained her husband&rsquo;s help.</p>
<p>It was just this confession, this humiliation, to  which Lady Valeria could not bring herself. Candour was the very last virtue to  which she inclined. She had not been brought up in the school of truth. Her  father had been a tyrant, her mother a dealer in expedients, a diplomatist, a  marvel of tact and cleverness, able to achieve wonders in domestic management  and in social policy. But life at Carlavarock Castle had been a constant  strain, and duplicity had become an instinct with mother and children. There  had been always something to hide from the Earl &mdash; a son&rsquo;s debts, a daughter&rsquo;s  flirtation, a milliner&rsquo;s bill, a debt of honour. Valeria had been oppressed  with gambling debts before she was twenty. She had played deep, and borrowed  money in her first season. She had married, hoping that General Harborough&rsquo;s  wealth would be hers to spend as she pleased; but in this she had been  disappointed. She had married the most generous of men; but she had married a  man of business. He made a magnificent settlement before marriage; he made a  will after marriage, leaving the bulk of his fortune to his young wife, to be  hers, and in her own control, if there were no children &mdash; hers without an  embargo against a second marriage. She had pin-money that would have been a  liberal allowance for a countess; but she had not the handling of her husband&rsquo;s  income. She could not have cheated him out of a five-pound note. He had told  her in the beginning of their married life that it would be so. He was a man of  business, and she was too young to be troubled with the sordid details of  domestic life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Order what you like, love. Make our home as  beautiful as you can. I will pay your bills, and take care that you are not  cheated by your tradesmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the outset Lady Valeria had accepted this  arrangement as altogether delightful; but there came a time when she found that  it had its inconveniences.</p>
<p>To-night, in the balmy September weather, the  windows of the villa were all open to the sky and the garden, open to the music  of the distant sea, and Lady Valeria was sitting in the verandah where a week  ago she had bidden farewell to Bothwell Grahame. It was nearly midnight, and  the crowd was concentrated in the music-room, where Herr Stahlmann was playing  a new Sauterelle on his violoncello. The moon was shining over the sea yonder,  gleaming upon the long white line of the breakwater; and the distant view of  town and harbour looked even more Italian than in the daytime. Lady Valeria  wore a long flowing gown of an almost Grecian simplicity, a gown of dead-white  cashmere, bordered with a marvellous embroidery of peacocks&rsquo; feathers, which  fell in a slanting line from shoulder to hem, the brilliant colouring flashing  in the moonlight, as the wearer slowly fanned herself with a large  peacock-feather fan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you not afraid to wear so many peacocks&rsquo;  feathers?&rdquo; asked a gentleman who was sitting at her elbow, a handsome man of  about forty &mdash; a man who was not altogether good style in dress or manner, but  who had a certain ease and authority which indicated good birth and the habits  of fashionable society.</p>
<p>This was Sir George Varney, a personage in the  racing world, but reputed to have been utterly broken for the last three years.  In the racing world there is always a chance so long as a man can keep his head  above water; and Sir George might still have a future before him. Although he  was supposed to have spent his last farthing and mortgaged his last acre, he  always contrived to get money when he wanted it; and he had contrived to lend  money to Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I not wear peacocks&rsquo; feathers?&rdquo; Lady  Valeria asked languidly.</p>
<p>Her profile was turned to him, her eyes were  looking towards the line of moonlight on the sea, the white walls of barracks  and storehouses. She did not take the trouble to turn her face to her companion  as she spoke to him. Pale, languid, dreamy, she seemed the very image of  indifference.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they are considered so&rdquo; &mdash; casting about  for a mild expression&mdash; &ldquo;confoundedly unlucky. I remember the morning of the  Oaks, the year my Cherryripe shut up like a telescope half a furlong from the  winning-post, my sister Grace drove up to Hatchett&rsquo;s to meet the drag &mdash; I was  to drive her and a lot of &rsquo;em to Epsom, don&rsquo;t you know &mdash; with an infernal  pork-pie hat made out of a peacock&rsquo;s breast. &lsquo;What did you wear that damn thing  for?&rsquo; I asked. &lsquo;Because it&rsquo;s the fashion,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if my  mare lost the race on account of your damn tile,&rsquo; says I. Grace chaffed me for  my superstition; but the mare made a most unaccountable mess of herself, don&rsquo;t  you know, and the Devil himself or that peacock-feather hat must have been at  the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the peacocks&rsquo; feathers will make any  difference to me,&rdquo; replied Valeria wearily. &ldquo;I have been unlucky all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Fate has been rather hard upon you,&rdquo; said  Sir George, drawing his chair a little nearer to hers, gazing at the delicate  profile with a more ardent look than was quite within the lines of friendship  and good-fellowship. &ldquo;A beautiful young woman married to a man old enough to be  her grandfather, carried off to broil away her existence in Bengal, when she  ought to have been one of the queens of London society &mdash; stinted to a bare  allowance of pin-money, hardly enough to pay her dressmaker, by Jove, when she  ought to have had the command of her husband&rsquo;s purse. Why not cut the whole  business, Valeria, and go to the south of France with me, directly after the  Newmarket week? I stand to win a pot of money, and we can spend it merrily at  Monaco. I know how to make plenty more when that&rsquo;s gone. And by and by, when the  General goes off the hooks, we can make things fair and square with the world &mdash;  or before, if you&rsquo;d rather not wait. The thing can be so easily managed. Look  at your cousin, Lady Cassandra, and the Colonel, and the Duke and his Countess  &mdash; change of partners all round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tried to encircle the slim waist with his strong  arm &mdash; the arm of a man who had won cups at Lillie Bridge in days gone by &mdash; but  Valeria snatched herself from him with a disdainful laugh, rose from her chair,  and walked to the other end of the verandah, he following her, sorely  disconcerted. He had been watching for his opportunity, and he fancied the  opportunity had come. He had neither creed nor principles of his own, and he  believed that people who pretended to be better than himself were all  hypocrites. Like Dumas&rsquo; hero, he was ready to admit that there might be good  women in the world, only he had never happened to meet with one.</p>
<p>He had made himself useful to Lady Valeria: had  told her what horses to back, and had helped her to win a good deal of money  since her return to England. Her losses had been the result of her own  inspirations: and of late, when she had so lost, Sir George had found her the  money to settle with the bookmen. And having done all this, and having devoted  all his leisure to the cultivation of Lady Valeria&rsquo;s acquaintance, he deemed  that the time was ripe for him to ask her to run away with him. He had run away  with so many women in the course of the last twenty years that his manner of  proposing the thing had become almost a formula. He modified his appeal  according to the rank of the adored one &mdash; had his first, second, and third  class supplications; but it was not in his nature to be poetical. Had he been  making love to an empress, he could not have risen to any loftier height than  that which he had reached to-night.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria turned at the end of the verandah, and  faced him deliberately in the bright, cold moonlight, a white and ghostlike  figure, with pale face and flashing eyes. She measured him from head to foot with  a look of unqualified scorn; gazed at him steadily, with eyes that seemed to  read all the secrets of his evil life; and then, slowly unfurling her peacock  fan, she broke into a silvery laugh, long and clear and sweet, but with a ring  of contemptuousness in its every note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, Sir George,&rdquo; she said quietly,  moving towards the open window of the corridor, as if to return to the house.  &ldquo;Your almost infallible judgment is at fault. I am not that kind of person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would have passed him and gone into the house,  but he put himself between her and the open window. He barred her way with all  the hulk of his handsome, over-dressed person. That ringing laughter, the  insolent sparkle in her magnificent eyes, goaded him to madness. Sir George had  a diabolical temper, and the insensate vanity of a successful <em>rou&eacute;</em>. That any woman could really  despise him was beyond his power of belief; but a woman who pretended to  despise him put herself beyond the pale of his courtesy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he muttered savagely. &ldquo;You are not that kind  of person. You are not that kind of person for me, because for the last three  years you have been that kind of person for somebody else. I thought you must  have been tired of Bothwell Grahame by this time, and that I should have had my  chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a breath, as if from the stroke of a Cyclops  hammer, George Varney had measured his length upon the tesselated pavement  under the verandah. It was an old man&rsquo;s arm that felled him; but an athlete of  five-and-twenty could not have struck a firmer blow.</p>
<p>General Harborough had stolen into the gardens to  smoke a solitary cigar, while Herr Stahlmann played his Sauterelle, and, coming  quietly round the house, he had approached the verandah just in time to hear  Sir George&rsquo;s last speech. He had not hesitated a minute as to the manner of his  answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to your guests, Valeria,&rdquo; he said, with quiet  command; &ldquo;I will see to this blackguard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Valeria obeyed half mechanically. The shock of  those last few moments had made thought impossible. Her mind seemed to have  suddenly become a blank. She went through the brilliant rooms, wondering at the  lights and flowers and smartly-dressed people, seeing everything vaguely, with  a puzzled doubtfulness as to her own identity. She talked and laughed with more  than usual animation for the rest of the evening. She had a friendly smile and  a pleasant word for each departing guest. She enchanted the artists by her  appreciation of their work; yet she had no more consciousness of what she said  or to whom she spoke than a condemned criminal might have on the eve of his  execution.</p>
<p>It was nearly two o&rsquo;clock when she went to her own  rooms &mdash; those spacious rooms, with their windows looking different ways, over  hill and valley, town and sea; rooms beautified by all that art and wealth can  compass in the way of luxury; rooms in which she had sat hour after hour, day  after day, brooding treason, caring more for one look from Bothwell&rsquo;s dark eyes  than for all that glory of sea and land, for all the luxuries with which an  adoring husband had surrounded her.</p>
<p>She had seen the General moving about among his  guests at the last. She had heard the strong cheery tones of his voice as he  parted with some particular friend; and now she wondered if she would find him  in her morning-room, where on such a night as this they had been wont to spend  half an hour in light, careless talk, after the people were gone, he sitting  out on the balcony, perhaps, smoking a final cigar.</p>
<p>Yes, he was there before her, sitting on a sofa, in  a meditative attitude, with his elbow on his knee, far from the lamp, with its  low, spreading shade, a lamp which shed a brilliant light upon Lady Valeria&rsquo;s  own particular writing-table, and left all the rest of the room in shadow.</p>
<p>Then at the sight of that familiar figure, the bent  head, the honoured gray hairs, all the horror of the scene in the verandah  flashed back upon her. The unmitigated insult of Sir George&rsquo;s speech, such  insult as might have been flung at the lowest woman in London, speech shaped  just as it might have been shaped for such an one. That she, Lady Valeria  Harborough, should have such dirt cast in her face, and that the man who had so  spoken could live to tell other men what he had said, to boast of himself at  the clubs!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would to God that blow had killed him!&rdquo; she said  to herself; and then she went across the room and knelt at her husband&rsquo;s feet,  and took his strong hand in hers, and covered it with kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you for defending me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am  not a good woman, I am not worthy of you, but I am not such a wretch as that  man&rsquo;s words would make me. You will believe that &mdash; won&rsquo;t you, Walter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear, I believe that. I cannot think you a  false wife, Valeria, though you may be an unloving one. I have thought for a  long time that the sweet words, and sweeter smiles which have made the light of  my life might mean very little &mdash; might mean just the daily sacrifice which a  young wife makes to an old husband, and nothing more. Yet I have contrived to  be happy, Valeria, in spite of all such doubts; and now this man&rsquo;s foul taunt  comes like a blast from a Polar sea, and freezes my blood. What did it mean,  Valeria? I thought Bothwell Grahame was my friend. I have been almost as fond  of him as if he were my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is your friend, Walter; yes, your true and  loyal friend &mdash; more loyal than I have been as your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What disloyalty have you practised towards me?&rdquo; he  demanded, grasping her by the shoulder, looking into those frightened eyes of  hers with his honest steady gaze, the look of a man who would read all secrets  in her face, even the worst. &ldquo;What has there ever been between you and Bothwell  which could involve disloyalty to me? Don&rsquo;t lie to me, Valeria! There must have  been some meaning in that man&rsquo;s speech. He would not have dared so to have  spoken if he had not known something. What has Bothwell been to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loved me &mdash;&rdquo; faltered the pale lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you returned his love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only hung her head for answer, the beautiful  head on the slim and graceful throat, circled with that string of pearls which  had been her husband&rsquo;s last birthday gift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You returned his love, and you encouraged him to  come to your husband&rsquo;s house, to be your chosen companion at all times and  seasons, the &lsquo;nice boy&rsquo; of whom you spoke so lightly as to disarm suspicion. By  Heaven, I would as soon have suspected your footman as Bothwell Grahame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was never more to me than a friend. I knew how  to respect myself,&rdquo; she answered, with a touch of sullenness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew how to respect yourself, and you spent  half your days in the society of a lover! Is that your idea of self-respect? It  is not mine. You respected yourself, and you were careful of your own interests  so far as to refrain from running away with the man you loved. What need of an  elopement, when the sands must soon run down in the hourglass, and the  gray-haired veteran would be gone, leaving you a rich widow, free to marry the  man of your heart? No need to defy the world, to outrage society, when  everything would work round naturally to give you your own way. O Valeria, it  is hard for a man to have his eyes opened after years of blissful blindness! I  was better off as your dupe than I am as your confessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed bitterly, a contemptuous laugh, at the  thought of his own folly. To think that he had believed it possible this woman  could love him &mdash; this lovely, spiritual creature, all light and flame; to  suppose that such a woman could be happy as an old man&rsquo;s darling, that this  young bright soul could be satisfied with the worship of declining years, the  steady glow of affection, constant, profound, but passionless! No, for such a  soul as this the fiery element was a necessity. Love without passion was love  without poetry.</p>
<p>Well, the dream was over. He could believe that  this proud woman had not dishonoured him, that she could stand before the eyes  of men stainless, a faithful wife, as the world counts faithfulness. But he  felt not the less that the dream of his declining years was over &mdash; that she  could never more be to him as she had been, the sweet companion of his leisure,  the trusted partner of his life. That was all over and done with. He was not  going to revile her, or to torture her, or to thrust her from him. To what end?  The gulf would be wide enough, they two living side by side. He would pay her  all honour before the world to the end of his days. To live with her, and to be  kind to her, knowing that her heart belonged to another, should be his  sacrifice, his penance for having tied that young sapling to this withered  trunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have noticed that Grahame has kept aloof from us  of late,&rdquo; he said, after a long silence. &ldquo;Why is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We agreed that it was better we should see no more  of each other,&rdquo; his wife answered quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will always remain in that agreement,&rdquo;  said the General.</p>
<p>He sat up till daybreak, and he occupied part of  his time in writing the rough draft of a codicil to his will, which he meant to  take to his London solicitors at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>The codicil lessened Lady Valeria&rsquo;s fortune  considerably, and allotted 40,000&pound; to a fund, the interest of which was to be  distributed in the form of pensions to twenty widows of field-officers who had  died in impoverished circumstances. This subtraction would still leave an  estate which would make Lady Valeria Harborough a very rich widow, and a  splendid prize in the matrimonial market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will marry Bothwell Grahame, and forget the  days of her slavery,&rdquo; thought the General, as he wrote the closing paragraph of  his codicil.</p>
<p>It was from no malignant feeling against his wife  that he made this change in the disposition of his wealth. He felt that the act  was mere justice. To the wife whom he had believed wholly true he bequeathed  all. To the woman who had been only half loyal he left half. A mean man would  have fettered his bequest by the prohibition of a second marriage; but General  Harborough was not that kind of man.</p>
<p>He wondered whether Sir George Varney would take  any action in the matter of that blow. He had assisted the fallen man to a  chair in the verandah, and had taken him a tumbler of brandy, which Sir George  drank as if it had been water. In his half-stunned condition the Baronet had  sworn an oath or two, and had walked off muttering curses, which might mean  threats of speedy vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is the scoundrel I think him, he will send  me a summons, in order to drag my wife&rsquo;s name before the public,&rdquo; thought  General Harborough; nor was he mistaken, for the summons was served within two  days of the assault. It was delivered at the villa in the General&rsquo;s absence. He  had started for Bath by an early train that morning, in order to attend the  funeral of an old friend and brother officer upon the following day. He had an  idea of going on from Bath to London, to see his solicitors, and to execute the  codicil which was to diminish Lady Valeria&rsquo;s future means.</p>
<p>At the station he met Bothwell Grahame, who was on  his way to Dawlish.</p>
<p>There had been a reserve in the young man&rsquo;s manner  of late which had puzzled the General. He had been inclined to put down the  change to a deterioration in Grahame&rsquo;s character, a gradual going to the bad,  for he had an instinctive prejudice against a soldier who could voluntarily  abandon his profession. It was bad enough for a man to be thrown out of active  service in the prime of life, in accordance with new-fangled rules and regulations;  but that a young man should abandon soldiering for any other career seemed to  General Harborough at once inexplicable and discreditable. &ldquo;Bothwell Grahame is  getting a regular hang-dog look,&rdquo; thought the General; &ldquo;and I am not surprised  at it. He has thrown away splendid opportunities, and is leading an idle,  good-for-nothing life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now the General knew the meaning of that  hang-dog look, that reserved manner which had struck him as the outward sign of  an inward deterioration in the man he had loved as a son. He could understand  what agonies of shame and remorse Bothwell must have felt when their hands  touched, what self-contempt was expressed in that cloudy brow and furtive  glance.</p>
<p>What, then, was his surprise this morning to see  Bothwell approach him with a beaming countenance, holding out the hand of  friendship!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear General, I am so glad to see you. It is  such an age since we met,&rdquo; he exclaimed, in cheeriest tones.</p>
<p>Yes, there was the old ring in his voice, the old  heartiness which had made Bothwell so different from the race of languid  foplings &mdash; the haw-haw tribe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is some time since we met,&rdquo; answered the  General coldly; &ldquo;but I daresay you and my wife have seen each other pretty  frequently during that time. You are the kind of man our neighbours call <em>l&rsquo;ami de la maison</em>. We English have a  less honourable name for the species. We call them tame cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell reddened, and then grew pale. Never before  had those kindly eyes of the veteran&rsquo;s looked at him as they looked to-day.  Never before had General Harborough addressed him in a tone which sounded like  deliberate insult.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been proud to be Lady Valeria&rsquo;s guest,&rdquo; he  said quietly, his heart beating furiously the while, &ldquo;and have never considered  myself degraded by any attention I was able to show to her. I hope she is  well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is very well. How long is it since you were at  Fox Hill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly a fortnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been very much occupied,&rdquo; said Bothwell,  divining that something had occurred to excite the General&rsquo;s suspicions, and  that it behoved him to speak frankly of his new hopes. &ldquo;I have been working a  good deal harder than I have ever worked since I passed my last examination.  But we are just going to start. May I get into the same carriage with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you like,&rdquo; said the General, which hardly  sounded encouraging; but Bothwell, who was virtuously travelling third-class,  got into a first-class compartment with the General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, pray, what new trade are you working at?&rdquo;  asked the old man, fixing Bothwell with the clear keen gaze of honest gray  eyes, eyes which had almost the brightness of youth.</p>
<p>Bothwell explained his new plans, the General  listening with polite attention, but with none of the old friendliness, that  cheery kindness which had so often been to Bothwell as a whip of scorpions,  torturing him with the sense of his own meanness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, pray, what may be the motive of this  industrious spurt?&rdquo; asked the General. &ldquo;What has inspired this idea of a useful  life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very old-fashioned and hackneyed motive,  General. I am engaged to be married, and have to think of how I can best  provide a home for my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Is the engagement of long standing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I have been engaged within the last  fortnight; but I have known and admired the lady for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Harborough looked at him searchingly. Was  this a lie &mdash; a ready lie invented on the spur of the moment, to dispel  suspicion? Bothwell had doubtless perceived the alteration in his old friend&rsquo;s  feelings towards him; and he might consider this notion of an engagement the  readiest way of throwing dust in a husband&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I know the young lady?&rdquo; he asked quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. She has not been much away from her  home, but her brother is a well-known personage in Plymouth. The lady is Hilda  Heathcote, sister of Mr. Heathcote, the coroner for Cornwall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! I have heard of Mr. Heathcote. So you are  going to marry Miss Heathcote? Rather a good match, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never considered it from a worldly point of  view. Miss Heathcote is a most lovable girl, and has all the charms and  accomplishments which the most exacting lover could desire in his betrothed. I  am infinitely proud of having won her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He met the General&rsquo;s eyes, and the steady light in  his own was the light of truth. General Harborough doubted him no longer. If he  had ever loved Valeria, that passion was extinct, dead as the flames of Dido&rsquo;s  funeral pyre. The man who sat face to face with General Harborough to-day was a  happy lover, his countenance radiant with the light of a pure and authorised  love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When are you going to be married?&rdquo; asked the  General, after a longish pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as I can set my house in order and induce  Hilda to name the day,&rdquo; answered Bothwell frankly. &ldquo;My dear girl has to be  submissive to her brother&rsquo;s will in this matter, and he is now in Paris.  Nothing can be finally settled till he comes back. I am stealing a march upon  him to-day in going to see the lady &mdash; who has been sent to Dawlish to be out of  my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, she is at Dawlish, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; she is staying there with her nieces and  their governess. I am going to consult her about our house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our house!&rdquo; What pride there was in the utterance!  The General&rsquo;s doubts were gradually melting away. He could not believe that a  man who was so obviously in love with his betrothed could have ever cared much  for Valeria. To have loved her, and to have exchanged her love for that of any  other woman living, seemed to the General an impossibility. He began to think  that his wife had exaggerated the situation the other night, in the overwrought  state of her nerves, stung to madness by Varney&rsquo;s insolent speech, excited by  her husband&rsquo;s retaliation. He began to think that there had been only the  mildest flirtation between Bothwell and his wife &mdash; the ordinary up-country  sentimentality, meaningless, puerile.</p>
<p>He tried to comfort himself with this view of the  case. His natural kindness of heart prompted him to help Bothwell if he could.  He wanted to respect the wife he loved, to think well of the man who had saved  his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Bothwell,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have come to a  crisis in life which most men find as costly as it is delightful. If by any  chance you happen to be what our young people call &lsquo;short,&rsquo; I hope you will  allow me to be your banker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too good,&rdquo; faltered Bothwell, strongly  moved. &ldquo;You have always been too good to me &mdash; ever so much better than I  deserved. No, I am wonderfully well off. My cousin has advanced me a sum of  money which she wishes me to take as a gift, but which I intend to treat as a  loan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is generally a distinction without a  difference &mdash; when the transaction is between relations,&rdquo; said the General,  smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, but in this case I hope the loan will be  repaid, for the repayment will hinge upon my prosperity. I have opened a  banking-account at Bodmin, and feel myself a moneyed man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>General Harborough encouraged Bothwell to talk of  his sweetheart and his prospects all the way to Dawlish; and then, when the  train stopped at the little station beside the sea, Bothwell and his old friend  shook hands cordially; and Bothwell felt that he could clasp that honest hand  without a pang of conscience. Little did he think that it was the last time  that hand would rest in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me know the date of your wedding,&rdquo; cried the  General, as the train moved off; and Bothwell went in high spirits to look for  the temple, in the shape of a pretty little house in a garden by the sea, which  enshrined his goddess.</p>
<p>Fortune seemed to be showering her gifts upon him  with a bounteous hand. Nothing could have been more propitious than this  meeting with General Harborough, who had promised all the help his influence  could afford to the army coach.</p>
<p>The General went on to his destination. The gay  white city of Bath had no attraction for him upon this particular afternoon. He  called on the widow of his old friend, and comforted her as much as it was  possible for any one to comfort her in her great sorrow. He dined alone and  sadly at his hotel; and as he sat and pondered on the events of the last week,  he began to speculate how much or how little grief <em>his</em> widow would feel when her day of mourning came. Would her  eyelids be puffy and red as poor Mrs. Thornton&rsquo;s had been this afternoon, when  he was talking to her? Would her swollen lips quiver, and her distorted  features twitch convulsively? Would her whole frame be shaken with sobs when  she talked of the departed? He could not imagine Lady Valeria with puffy  eyelids or swollen lips. He pictured her mourning gracefully, clad in softest  white draperies, reclining in a darkened room, in an atmosphere perfumed with  tuberose and stephanotis. He pictured her with a sphinx-like countenance, calm,  beautiful, an expression which might mean deepest grief or stoniest  indifference, as the world chose to construe it.</p>
<p>No, honestly, after considering the question from  every possible point of view, General Harborough did not believe that his wife  would grieve for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a relief to her when I am gone,&rdquo; he  said to himself. &ldquo;How could I expect her to grieve as Thornton&rsquo;s wife grieves?  Those two were boy and girl together, had been husband and wife for thirty  years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His dinner had been only a pretence of dining, a  mockery which had made the head-waiter quite unhappy. Nothing so distresses a  good waiter as a guest who won&rsquo;t eat. The waiter would have been still more  troubled in mind had he known that this fine-looking old man, with the erect  figure and broad shoulders, had eaten hardly anything for the last three days.  The General had been suffering all that time from a fever of the brain which had  brought about a feverish condition of the body. He could neither eat nor sleep.  He lay broad awake in the unfamiliar room at the hotel, staring at the blank  white blinds, faintly illuminated by the lamps in the street below &mdash; he lay and  thought over his wedded life, which unrolled itself before him in a series of  pictures, and he saw the bitter truth underlying his marriage with Lord  Carlavarock&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>He had been nothing but a convenience to Valeria,  the provider of fine houses and fine gowns, horses and carriages. She had not  even cared for him as friend and protector. She had lived her own life; paying  him for all benefits with sweet false words, and sweeter falser kisses.</p>
<p>And now the spell was broken; the dream had come to  an end all at once. He could never believe in sweet words or kisses again. He  had looked into the heart of this woman he had loved so well, and he knew that  it was false to the core.</p>
<p>The next day was wild and stormy &mdash; rain and wind,  wind and rain &mdash; a gray sky, a heavy pall of cloud, through which the sun  pierced not once in the long bleak day; one of those days which Nature keeps in  stock for the funerals of our friends.</p>
<p>General Harborough stood in the dreary cemetery,  and let the wind and rain beat upon him unflinchingly for about forty minutes.  He paid every tribute of respect that could be paid to his old comrade and then  he went off to the railway-station, to go back to Plymouth by the train which  left Bath at five o&rsquo;clock, and would arrive in Plymouth a little before eleven.  He had given up the idea of going on to London to execute the codicil. That  could be done at Fox Hill, if need were. He felt tired and ill and shivery. He  thought he had taken a chill in the cemetery, and that the best thing he could  do was to go home.</p>
<p>He had a bad night, disturbed by a short, hard  cough, which was worse next morning. Lady Valeria sent for the doctor, who  pronounced the indisposition an acute attack of bronchitis. The patient was  very feverish, and the utmost care was needed. Happily, the valet was a good  nurse, and Lady Valeria seemed devoted. She sat by her husband&rsquo;s bedside; she  read to him, and ministered to him with the tenderest care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could not be better off,&rdquo; said the medical  man, who was of the cheery old school. &ldquo;We shall make you all right in a day or  two,&rdquo; knowing perfectly well that the patient was in for a fortnight&rsquo;s close  confinement and severe regimen.</p>
<p>The General endured his poultices and blisters  meekly, but chafed at the hot room and the hissing steam-kettle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is worse than being wounded on the field of  battle,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And then, half asleep and half delirious, he began  to talk about Sir George Varney&rsquo;s summons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The scoundrel wants to make a public scandal,&rdquo; he  muttered; &ldquo;he will bring my wife&rsquo;s name before the public. &lsquo;I thought by this  time you must have been tired of Bothwell Grahame,&rsquo;&rdquo; he said, repeating the  words which had stung him almost to madness.</p>
<p>Valeria knelt by her husband&rsquo;s pillow and laid her  head against it, listening intently to those muttered speeches. She found out  that Sir George Varney had sent the General a summons to a police-court; that  the story of the blow in the verandah would be sifted in a public inquiry; that  the insult offered to the wife, the prompt retaliation of the husband, would be  reported in the newspapers, written about, commented upon everywhere. It was  just the kind of thing to get into the society papers: and although Lady  Valeria&rsquo;s relations had not unfrequently figured in those very papers, with  various degrees of discredit to themselves and amusement to the general public,  she shrank with an abhorrent feeling from the idea of seeing her own name  there.</p>
<p>The day named in the summons was a week off; and,  judging from General Harborough&rsquo;s condition, it did not seem likely that he  would be in a fit state to answer to the summons in person. The idea of it  evidently preyed upon his mind, and added fuel to the fire of the fever.</p>
<p>The day came, and General Harborough had obeyed a  mightier summons, and had gone to appear before the bar of a greater court.  Lady Valeria was a widow.</p>
<p>The codicil had not been executed: so Lady Valeria  was a very rich widow.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter19"></a>Chapter 19<br>
  Widowed And Free</h2>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Wyllard made their way slowly back to  Penmorval. It was a melancholy journey for those two who had travelled so gaily  in days gone by &mdash; the young wife so full of hope, so proud of her husband, who  was her senior and superior, versed in the knowledge of that wide outer world  of which the Cornish heiress knew so little. She had loved him with a reverent,  admiring love, looking up to him, honouring him and deferring to him in all  things, pleased to be dependent upon him: and now he was the dependent, looking  to her for help and comfort.</p>
<p>He bore his calamity with an almost awful calmness,  which at times was more painful to the tender, sympathetic wife than  fretfulness and complaining would have been. The dull agony of neuralgic pain  wrung no groan from him; he endured the anguish of racked nerves and aching  limbs with stoical composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a surprise to me, Dora,&rdquo; he said  quietly, when his wife praised his patience; &ldquo;I have expected some such attack.  There have been sensations &mdash; strange feelings at odd times &mdash; which, although  slight enough, have not been without their meaning. Life was very smooth for me  here at Penmorval. Very different from my life in the past; the struggles of my  boyhood; the hard work and hard thinking of my manhood. Your love made  existence full of sweetness. I had the world&rsquo;s esteem too, which must always  count for something, let a man pretend to despise the world as he may. Yes; it  was a full and perfect life, and I told myself that I had come off a winner in  the lottery of Fate. And now all things are changed. There was this last lot  waiting for me at the bottom of the urn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest,&rdquo; murmured his wife, nestling closer to  him among the heaped-up pillows of his sofa, &ldquo;it would be too hard, too cruel  that you should be thus smitten, if this life were all. But, praised be God, it  is not all! There is a bright eternity waiting for us &mdash; a long day of rest in  the land where there is neither sorrow nor pain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband answered with an impatient sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Dora, I have neither your sweet simplicity  nor your pious faith in the letter of an old book,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;This life is  so palpable and so painful just now, that I cannot comfort myself by looking  beyond it towards a life of which I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at Penmorval. Mrs. Wyllard had  established her husband in her own particular sanctum, which was the prettiest  room in the house &mdash; a spacious airy room on the first floor, with a large Tudor  window facing southward, and an oriel in the south-western angle. Julian  Wyllard had decorated and furnished this room for his young wife; and all  things it contained had been chosen with reference to her tastes and pursuits.  It opened into her dressing-room, and beyond the dressing-room there was the  chief bedchamber of Penmorval, the chamber of the lord of the manor from time  immemorial, the birth-chamber and the death-chamber. Its very spaciousness and  grandeur gave to this state apartment an air of gloom, a gloom intensified by  the prevailing tints of the tapestry, a series of hunting scenes, executed in a  sombre gradation of bluish greens and grayish browns. The elaborately carved  oak wardrobes were like monuments in a Gothic cathedral. The bed, with its  embroidered velvet hangings, fluted columns, and plumed ornaments, suggested a  royal catafalque: while the fireplace, with its sculptured pillars and heavy  decoration in black and white marble, recalled the entrance to the Capulets&rsquo;  tomb. Not a room assuredly for the occupation of an invalid &mdash; not a room in  which to suffer sleepless nights and long hours of dull, wearing pain.</p>
<p>This was what Dora thought; and at her order her  dressing-room, which was airy and sufficiently spacious, was transformed into a  bedroom for Mr. Wyllard, while her morning-room was arranged for his daily  occupation. It would be easy to wheel his sofa from one room to the other. All  her orders had been telegraphed beforehand, and everything was in its place  when the sufferer arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a special privilege to be nursed by a good  fairy,&rdquo; he said, smiling up at his wife, with that rare smile which had so  peculiar a charm in her eyes &mdash; the smile of a man who has not the same set  graciousness for all comers.</p>
<p>After this there came the dull monotony of  suffering &mdash; the life of routine, that death-in-life from which all possibility  of action is gone, all power of choice, all changes and chances of the outer  world cut off for ever &mdash; a life in which a man feels that he has suddenly  dropped back into infancy, and is as helpless as a child upon his mother&rsquo;s  knee. The child has all the unexplored future before him, the infinitive  potentialities of life. The man turns his sad eyes backward and reviews the  past. All the things he has done and the things he has left undone pass in a  shadowy procession before his mind&rsquo;s eye. He sees how much wiser he might have  been. The faults and follies of those departed years are unrolled before him as  on a magic scroll. His maturer judgment, his colder blood, condemn the sins of  his passionate youth.</p>
<p>Dora was her husband&rsquo;s companion through many an  hour of gloom and depression. There were times when he would talk to her with a  kind of feverish animation &mdash; talk of the books he had read, or of the men he  had known &mdash; recall the memories of his youth &mdash; his boyhood even.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only live in the past,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and in  your love. You are my present and my future, Dora. Were it not for you and your  love I should have anticipated annihilation. The grave could hardly reduce me  to more complete nothingness than this death-in-life here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked round the room with an impatient sigh.  And then, touched by the pathetic look in his wife&rsquo;s face, he added,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were it not for you, Dora. I have infinite riches  while I possess your love. If I were to lose that now &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that you can never lose it. My love is a  part of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but there might come a crushing blow that  would kill it. Or if I were to sink into feebleness and imbecility &mdash; if the  mind were to decay like the body &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only difference would be to make me love you  more fondly, knowing that you stood in greater need of my love,&rdquo; answered his  wife quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I believe you are noble enough for the  extremity of self-sacrifice,&rdquo; he said, gazing at her with a searching look, a  look of the deepest love and keenest pain, a look that told of anguish  surpassing the common woes of humanity. &ldquo;Yes, I believe it is within the  compass of a woman&rsquo;s nature to love a human wreck like me, or even to love a  creature stained with blackest sin. There is no limit to the sublimity of a  woman&rsquo;s love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His wife was kneeling by his couch, her head  leaning against his pillow. There were times when she could find no words of  comfort, when she could only comfort him with the light touch of her lips upon  his brow, her sympathy, her presence, her hand laid gently upon his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love to hear you talk of your youth,&rdquo; she said  one day, when he had been talking of his boyhood at Marlborough, and at home &mdash;  the dull old parsonage &mdash; the house-mother, always busy, and often scolding,  troubled about many things; the father, chewing the cud of somebody else&rsquo;s  sermon, in a shabby little den of a study, reeking of tobacco; a sermon to be  dribbled out slowly next Sunday morning, in a style of elocution, or  non-elocution, happily almost extinct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about your life in Paris,&rdquo; she went on,  encouraging him to forget his present pains in those old memories. &ldquo;That must  have been full of interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a life of grinding toil, and gnawing  anxiety,&rdquo; he answered impatiently. &ldquo;There is not a detail that could interest  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything in your past history interests me,  Julian. I know how hard you worked in Paris. I saw your desk, the place where  you sat night after night, the lamp that lighted you. Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein has  altered nothing in your rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vastly civil of him,&rdquo; muttered Wyllard, as if  revolting against patronage from a dealer in fancy goods.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But however hard you worked, you must have had  some associations with the outer world,&rdquo; pursued Dora. &ldquo;You must have felt the  fever and the excitement of that time. You must have been interested in the men  who governed France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was interested in the stocks that went up and  down, and in the men who governed France, so far as their conduct influenced  the Bourse. A man who is running a race, neck or nothing, a race that means  life or death, has no time to think of anything outside the course. The  external world has no existence for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you knew nothing of the master-spirits of the  Empire, the men of science, the writers, the painters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, how innocent you are! The men who write  books and paint pictures have no more direct influence upon an epoch than the  tailors who build coats and the milliners who make gowns. The master-spirits  are the politicians and financiers. Those are the rulers of their age. All the  rest are servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell had shown himself deeply moved by the  affliction that had fallen on his cousin&rsquo;s husband. Every feeling of ill-will  vanished in a breath before the face of that supreme misfortune &mdash; a life  smitten to the dust. Bothwell was too generous-hearted to remember that the  master of Penmorval had not been altogether kind in the past. His only thought  was how he could help, were it by ever so little, to lighten Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s  burden. He was all the more sympathetic when he found that the sufferer had  thought of him and of his interests even in the hour of calamity, while the  blow that crushed him was still a new thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was more than good of you to consider my  happiness at such a time,&rdquo; said Bothwell, when Dora had told him of her  husband&rsquo;s conversation with Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Bothwell, my wife&rsquo;s interests are my own;  and I knew that she was keenly interested in your happiness. Heathcote has not  found out very much about the girl who was killed; but he has found out just  enough to dispel his suspicions about you, and he withdraws all opposition to  your marriage with Hilda. Now, it is my earnest desire to see you happily  married before I am called away; and as life is always uncertain &mdash; trebly  uncertain for a man in my condition &mdash; the sooner you are married the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not plead for delay,&rdquo; said Bothwell, &ldquo;if I  can win Hilda&rsquo;s consent to an early marriage. But I hope, my dear Wyllard, that  you may live to see our children growing up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to hope for the indefinite prolongation of  an incurable disease, and is hardly a kind wish on your part. All you have to  do is to hurry on this marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately the house I have pitched upon will  want three or four months&rsquo; work before it can be habitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does that matter? You can live at Penmorval  till your house is ready. There is room for half a dozen families in this  rambling old place. There will be no one here to interfere with your privacy.  You may be almost as much alone as in your own home, and Hilda&rsquo;s presence in  the house will help to cheer my poor wife. Hurry on your marriage, Bothwell,  while Heathcote is in the humour to accept you. Don&rsquo;t be hindered by any absurd  consideration about houses; secure your good fortune while you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with an almost feverish impatience, the  fretfulness of a sick man who cannot bear the slightest opposition to his will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Julian, you may be sure that Bothwell will  be only too glad to act on your advice,&rdquo; said his wife soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him do so, then, and don&rsquo;t let him talk about  houses,&rdquo; retorted Wyllard.</p>
<p>Bothwell was to meet his betrothed the next day at  Trevena, where she was to go with Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein to inspect the  old-fashioned cottage which her lover wanted to turn into a commodious house.  There could not be a better opportunity for pleading his cause.</p>
<p>He rode across country, and arrived in time to  receive Hilda and her chaperon, who had posted from Launceston to Trevena. It  was a delicious autumn day, and, after the cottage had been inspected and  approved, the lovers wandered about the wild crest of Tintagel, utterly happy  in each other&rsquo;s company; while that discreet spinster, Miss Meyerstein, sat on  a grassy bank in the valley below, absorbed in a strip of honeycomb knitting,  intended to form part and parcel of a counterpane, which great work had been in  progress for the past ten years.</p>
<p>Bothwell was the bearer of a letter from Dora,  entreating Hilda to go to her at the Manor, and stay there until Heathcote&rsquo;s  return. Bothwell was to stay at Trevena meanwhile, and set the builders at work  upon his improvements. The old cottage and the land about it had been secured  on a lease for three lives, Bothwell being one, Hilda another, and one of the  twins the third. Bothwell hoped to be able to buy the place long before any of  these lives gave out.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You and I have so much to arrange and to talk  about,&rdquo; wrote Mrs. Wyllard&mdash; &ldquo;your furniture, your linen, your trousseau. I  venture to think I am your nearest friend, and the person you would be most  likely to consult in these matters. Your presence will comfort me, dear, and  hinder me from dwelling too exclusively on my great trouble. Julian, too, will  be glad to have you in the house, and to hear your songs sometimes of an  evening. He has his good days and his bad days; and there are times when he is  cheerful and likes company. Do come to me at once, Hilda. I am sure you must be  tired of Dawlish by this time. It is a very nice little place, but I can  imagine a limit to its attractions, and the season is rather late for your  favourite diversion of swimming. You shall be free to return to The Spaniards  when your brother comes back to England; but in the mean time I am sure I want  you more than Miss Meyerstein, who has those all-absorbing twins to occupy her  cares and thoughts. I shall expect you the day after to-morrow, by the  afternoon train. I shall send a carriage to meet you. &mdash; Yours lovingly, DORA  WYLLARD.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could Hilda say to such an invitation from one  who had been to her as an elder sister, and whom she loved as fondly as ever  sister was loved? She wrote to Dora at the hotel where they lunched and took  tea, and gave her letter to Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to Penmorval,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am going there the day after to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am to be banished. I am to live here and see  that my plans are carried out properly. I daresay my cousin thinks that if I  were to stay at Penmorval while you are there I should forget all the serious  business of life; lapse into a rapturous idiotcy of love. Well, I am too happy  to complain. I shall be happy in the thought that I am building our nest. I  shall watch every brick that is laid, every timber that is sawn. You shall not  have a badly baked brick or a plank of green wood in your house. I shall think  of the plans night and day, dream of them &mdash; leap out of my sleep in the dead of  the night to make some improvement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you chop and change too much you will have dear  to pay,&rdquo; said Miss Meyerstein; and then she launched into a long story about a  German Grand Duke, with an unpronounceable name, who built himself a summer  palace which cost three times as much as he intended, because of his Serene  Highness&rsquo;s artistic temperament, which had beguiled him into continual  tampering with the plans.</p>
<p>Never in his life had Bothwell felt happier than on  that breezy September day, pottering about the old cottage on the hillside,  planning the house and gardens of the future &mdash; the study, the drawing-room, the  ingle-nook in the dining-room, the little entrance-hall which would hardly be  more than a lobby, the closets and clever contrivances, and shelves, and cosy  nooks, which were to make this house different from all other houses &mdash; at least  in the eye of its possessor &mdash; the quaint old lattices which were to be retained  in all their primitive simplicity, and still quainter casements which were to  be added &mdash; here an oriel and there a bow &mdash; an Early English chimney-stack on  one side, and a distinctly Flemish weathercock on the other. Bothwell could  draw well enough to show the builder what he wanted done. He had his  pocket-book full of sketches for chimneys, pediments, doors and windows, and  ornamental ventilators.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would think you were going to build a town,&rdquo;  said the practical Fr&auml;ulein.</p>
<p>Never had Bothwell been happier than as he rode  across the moors in the fading daylight, thinking of the day that was over.  What a simple domestic day it had been &mdash; so homely, so tranquil, so sweet;  ending with the cosy tea-drinking in the parlour at the inn, Hilda presiding at  the tea-tray, and as self-possessed as if she and Bothwell had been married for  ten years. The time of tremors and agitations was past. They were secure in  each other&rsquo;s love, secure in the consent and approval of those who loved them.  Henceforward their lives were to sail calmly on a summer sea.</p>
<p>How different was this newer and purer love of his  from the old passion, with its alternations of fever and remorse! How different  his simple-minded sweetheart of to-day &mdash; gentle, unselfish, conscientious,  religious &mdash; from the woman who had been all exaction and caprice; insatiable in  her desire for admiration, self-indulgent, luxurious, caring not a jot how the  world outside her own boudoir went on, who suffered or who was glad, provided  her wishes were gratified and her vanity fed!</p>
<p>It was dinner-time when Bothwell arrived at  Penmorval, and the dinner-hour was of all seasons the most melancholy, now that  the master of the house was a helpless invalid on the upper floor, perhaps  never again to enter that stately dining-hall, where the butler insisted upon  serving Bothwell&rsquo;s dinner in just as slow and ceremonial a manner as if family  and guests had been assembled in full force.</p>
<p>Vainly did Bothwell plead against this ceremony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would ask them to cook me a chop,  Stodden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;A chop and a potato would be ample. I hate a long dinner at  any time, but most especially when I am to eat it alone. You need not take so  much trouble as you do about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Stodden ascribed all such speeches to  overweening modesty on Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s part. The poor young man knew that he was  in somewise an interloper; and he did not wish to give trouble. It was a very  proper feeling on his part; and Stodden was resolved that he should not be a  loser by his modesty. Stodden gave him an even handsomer dinner on the  following day, and when remonstrated with smiled the smile of incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lor, sir, you know you like a good dinner,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;You mayn&rsquo;t wish to give trouble; but you must like a good dinner. We all  like a good dinner. It&rsquo;s human nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this Bothwell felt that remonstrance was  useless.</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard dined with her invalid husband. She  rarely left him except when he was sleeping under the influence of morphia, or  when he asked to be alone. There were hours in his long and weary day in which  even his wife&rsquo;s presence seemed a burden to him, and when he preferred to fight  his battle in solitude.</p>
<p>Upon this particular evening of Bothwell&rsquo;s return  from Trevena his cousin joined him at the dinner-table, an unexpected pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to hear all your news, Bothwell,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;Julian is asleep, and I have half an hour free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell told his news gladly, gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is coming the day after to-morrow,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;and I am to be banished, like Romeo. But I am not afraid of Romeo&rsquo;s ill-luck.  You won&rsquo;t give my Juliet a sleeping potion, and bury her alive while I am away,  will you? I have taken two rooms in a cottage at Trevena, with an old goody who  is to do for me. That will be ever so much cheaper than the inn; and you know  that in my position I ought to be economical.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought not to make yourself uncomfortable for  the sake of a few pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is your spendthrift&rsquo;s argument. He never  can understand that he ought to save a few pounds; and so he dies a pauper;  while the man who has a proper respect for pounds &mdash; and pence, even &mdash; blossoms  into a millionaire. I shall be very comfortable with my goody. I shall be out  all day, superintending the builder. I shall live upon chops and porter; and I  shall sleep like a top every night, in a dear little bedroom smelling of  lavender. My goody is clean to a fault. She cast an evil eye at my boots as I  went up-stairs. All the articles of furniture in her rooms are veiled with  crochet-work, as if the wood were too precious to be exposed to the light. But  how grave you are looking, Dora! Has Wyllard been any worse to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he has been much the same &mdash; a sad monotony of  suffering. It was of you I was thinking, Bothwell. I saw some news in the  county paper which I know will grieve you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There has been no accident between Launceston and  Dawlish, has there?&rdquo; gasped Bothwell, starting up from his chair; &ldquo;the train  got back all right &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You foolish boy! If there had been an accident,  how do you suppose I could hear of it?&rdquo; exclaimed his cousin, smiling at his  vehemence. &ldquo;How like a lover to imagine that any ill news must needs be about  your betrothed, though you only left her three hours ago! No, Bothwell, my bad  news concerns an old friend of yours, General Harborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of General Harborough?&rdquo; asked Bothwell  anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The announcement of his death is in the county  paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His death? Impossible! Why, I met him less than  ten days ago. He seemed hale and hearty as ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He caught a severe cold at the funeral of a  friend, and died of bronchitis after a very short illness. Poor Bothwell! I can  sympathise with your sorrow for so staunch a friend. I have often heard you say  how good he was to you in India.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora had heard of General Harborough only as an  Indian friend of her cousin&rsquo;s. She knew of Lady Valeria&rsquo;s existence, and that  was all. No rumour of Bothwell&rsquo;s flirtation with that lady had ever reached her  ears. She did not know that Bothwell&rsquo;s frequent journeys to Plymouth had been  on Lady Valeria&rsquo;s account; that his mysterious journeys to London had been made  in her interests &mdash; troublesome journeys to interview Jew money-lenders, to  renew bills and tide over difficulties.</p>
<p>And now Valeria was a widow, and would have been  able to exact the fulfilment of old vows &mdash; breathed under tropical stars, far  away in that Eastern land which they both loved: she would have been able to  claim him as her slave, if he had not boldly broken his fetters in that last interview  at Fox Hill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God I delayed no longer!&rdquo; he said to  himself; &ldquo;thank God I got my release before this happened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he thought sadly, affectionately, of his  old friend; and he remembered with thankfulness that last meeting, that  farewell grasp of the good man&rsquo;s hand which he had been able to return as  honestly as it was given.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did I ever sin against him?&rdquo; he asked himself.  &ldquo;What an arrant sneak I must have been!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will go to General Harborough&rsquo;s funeral, I  suppose?&rdquo; said Dora presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course I must be at the funeral. When does  it take place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall go without doubt. I shall join the  procession at the cemetery. As I am not invited, there will be no need for me  to go to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose not. The poor widow will feel the blow  terribly, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have no doubt she will be sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not a lie. Bothwell thought that even  Valeria could not fail to feel some touch of sorrow for the loss of that  chivalrous friend and benefactor, the man who had given so much, and had  received so poor a return for his gifts. There would be the anguish of a guilty  conscience; even if there were no other form of sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, as I suppose she is elderly too, perhaps she  will not survive him very long,&rdquo; pursued Dora, infinitely compassionate for the  woes of a broken-hearted widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Valeria elderly!&rdquo; exclaimed Bothwell. &ldquo;She is  not thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, was your good General Harborough so foolish  as to marry a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It was the only foolishness of his life that  I have ever heard of; and he was so kind to the woman he married that he might  be pardoned for his folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope she was fond of him, and worthy of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell did not enter upon the question, and his  reticence about Lady Valeria Harborough struck Dora as altogether at variance  with his natural frankness. And then she remembered that unexplained  entanglement which he had confessed to her &mdash; an entanglement with a married  woman &mdash; and it flashed upon her that Lady Valeria might be the heroine of that  story. He had spoken of General Harborough, but never of General Harborough&rsquo;s  wife. There had been a studied reserve upon that subject. And now Dora  discovered that Valeria Harborough was a young woman.</p>
<p>The invitation to the funeral came by next  morning&rsquo;s post &mdash; a formal invitation sent by a fashionable firm of undertakers  &mdash; and Bothwell had no excuse for staying away from Fox Hill, where the mourners  were to assemble at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. He had no fear that Lady  Valeria would be present upon such an occasion; but there was just the  possibility that she might send for him when she knew he was in the house. She  had always been reckless of conventionalities, carrying matters with such a  high hand as to defy slander.</p>
<p>His heart sank within him as he approached the  classic portico of the villa. Deepest regret for his dead benefactor, deepest  remorse for having wronged him, weighed down his heart as he entered the  darkened house, where rooms built for brightness and gaiety looked all the more  gloomy in the day of mourning. The hall was hung with black, and in the midst  stood the plain oak coffin, draped with the colours which the General had  fought for forty years before among the wild hills of Afghanistan. Crosses and  wreaths of purest white were heaped upon the coffin, and the atmosphere of the  darkened hall was heavy with the perfume of stephanotis and tuberose; those two  flowers which the General had always associated with his wife, who rarely  decorated herself or her rooms with any other exotics.</p>
<p>Bothwell stood amidst the mourning crowd, with  heavily-beating heart. There was no summons from Lady Valeria, and he heard  some one near him telling some one else that her grief was terrible &mdash; a stony,  silent grief, which alarmed her people and her medical attendant. She would see  no one. Lady Carlavarock had come all the way from Baden, where the poor dear  Earl was doctoring his gout; but Lady Valeria had only consented to see her  mother for half an hour, and poor Lady Carlavarock had not even been asked to stay  at Fox Hill. She had been obliged to put up at an hotel, which was a cruelty,  as everyone knew that the Carlavarocks were as poor as church mice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Lady Valeria has not forgiven her family  for having sold her,&rdquo; said the second speaker, in the same confidential voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold her! Nothing of the kind. She adored the old  General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better tell that to &mdash; another branch of  the service,&rdquo; muttered his friend, as Bothwell moved away from the group.</p>
<p>It was past five before the funeral was over, and  there was no train for Bodmin till seven; so Bothwell strolled into the  coffee-room of the Duke of Cornwall and ordered a cup of tea.</p>
<p>While he was drinking it he was joined by a young  officer who had been at the funeral, and whom Bothwell had often met at Fox  Hill &mdash; quite a youth, beardless, and infantine of aspect, but with a keen  desire to appear older than his years. He affected to have steeped himself in  iniquity, to have dishonoured more husbands and fleeced more tradesmen than any  man in the service. He hinted that his father had turned him out of doors, and  that his mother had died of a broken heart on his account. He was a youth who  loved gossip, and who went about among all the wives and spinsters of Plymouth,  the dowagers and old ladies, disseminating tittle-tattle. Hardly anything he  said was true, hardly anybody believed him; but people liked to hear him talk  all the same. There was a piquancy in slander uttered by those coral lips,  which had not long finished with the corals of babyhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Bothwell, what a tragedy!&rdquo; he exclaimed,  as he seated himself in front of a brandy-and-soda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a sad loss for every one,&rdquo; Bothwell answered  tritely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sad loss &mdash; but, my dear fellow, what a scandal!  Everybody in Plymouth is talking about it. There has been hardly anything else  spoken of at any of the dinners I have been at during the last ten days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought old maids&rsquo; tea-parties were your usual  form,&rdquo; retorted Bothwell, with a sneer. &ldquo;What is your last mare&rsquo;s nest,  Falconer? The General&rsquo;s death, or the General&rsquo;s funeral?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circumstances that preceded the dear old man&rsquo;s  death. That&rsquo;s the scandal. Surely you must have heard &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider that I have been buried among the Cornish  moors, and have heard nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! Do you mean to say that you don&rsquo;t know  there was a dreadful row one night at Fox Hill? Sir George Varney insulted Lady  Valeria &mdash; called her some foul name, accused her of carrying on with a young  man. The General came up at the moment and smashed his head. Sir George went  all over the place next day, abusing my lady, sent the General a summons to the  police-court, where the whole story must have come out <em>in extenso</em>, as those, newspaper fellows say. A very ugly story it  is &mdash; betting transactions, borrowed money, and a lover in the background. An  uncommonly queer story, my dear Grahame. Plymouth was on the <em>qui-vive</em> for a tremendous scandal. You  know what these garrison and dockyard towns are, and a man in the General&rsquo;s  position is a mark for slander. The thing was altogether too awful, and the  poor old General wouldn&rsquo;t face it. He wouldn&rsquo;t face it, old chap, and he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean to say that he &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean to say nothing. There was no inquest. The  poor old man kept his bed for a week, and the cause of death was called  bronchitis; but there are people I know who have their own idea about the  General&rsquo;s death, and a very ugly idea it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends have a <em>penchant</em> for ugly ideas, Falconer,&rdquo; answered Bothwell coolly.</p>
<p>He did not believe a word of the subaltern&rsquo;s story,  and yet the thought of it troubled him as he sat alone in his corner of the  smoking-carriage, trying to solace himself with a pipe, trying to think only of  the girl he loved, and of his brightening prospects.</p>
<p>That mention of a lover! How much or how little did  it mean? Could it be true that General Harborough had knocked a man down in his  own house? Such an act on the part of the most chivalrous of men must have been  the result of extraordinary provocation. Only a deliberate insult to a woman  could excuse such an outrage against the laws of hospitality. He remembered  that Lady Valeria had talked of borrowing money from Sir George Varney; and  what could she expect but insult if she placed herself under obligation to a  notorious <em>roue?</em> He had warned her of  the folly of such a course. He had urged her to confide in her husband. And now  that good and loyal friend and protector was gone; and this last act of his  wife&rsquo;s had left her to face the world with a damaged reputation.</p>
<p>He told himself that there must be some grain of  truth in the subaltern&rsquo;s story, some fire behind this smoke. The scandal too  nearly touched actual facts to be altogether false.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help her if her good name is at the mercy of  such a scoundrel as Varney!&rdquo; thought Bothwell.</p>
<p>He left Penmorval in a dog-cart next morning,  carrying his portmanteau and a box of books at the back. He was to have the use  of the dog-cart and Glencoe while he stayed at Trevena, so that he should not  feel himself altogether banished. He could ride over to Penmorval occasionally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not come too often, mind,&rdquo; said Dora,  when she was bidding him good-bye. &ldquo;Indeed; on reflection, I think you had  better only come when you are invited. You may have no discretion otherwise. It  will not do for you to be really living here, and only pretending to live at  Trevena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is unkind of you to suggest that a man must be  an utter imbecile because he is in love, Dora,&rdquo; remonstrated Bothwell. &ldquo;Of  course I understand that I am sent away as a sacrifice to the proprieties. I am  banished in order that Mrs. Grundy may be satisfied &mdash; that same Mrs. Grundy who  was willing to suspect me of murder on the very smallest provocation. No, my  dear Dora, I am not going to be troublesome. I will only come when I have your  permission. I suppose I may come next Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Bothwell, this is Wednesday; Sunday is <em>very</em> near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will seem ages off to me. Yes, I shall  certainly come on Sunday. Even servants are allowed to go and see their friends  on the Sabbath. Is your cousin less than a hireling that he should be denied? I  shall ride over in time for breakfast on Sunday morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have to get up at six o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that? I have had to get up at four, and  even at half-past three, for cub-hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He arrived at Trevena early in the afternoon,  settled himself comfortably in his cottage-lodgings, and arranged his books in  a corner of the neat little parlour, with its superabundant crochet-work and  crockery, which ornamentation he artfully persuaded his landlady to put away in  a cupboard during his residence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men are so clumsy,&rdquo; he pleaded. &ldquo;They always spoil  things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goody confessed that the male sex was inherently  awkward, and had an innate incapacity to appreciate crochet antimacassars. She  sighed as she denuded her best parlour of its beauties. &ldquo;The place dew look so  bare,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Bothwell gave up his afternoon to a long interview  with the builder, who was a smart young man, and as honest as he was smart. The  old cottage was thoroughly overhauled and inspected, with a view to the  carrying out of those extensions and improvements which Bothwell had planned  for himself, and for which he had made drawings that were very creditable to an  amateur architect. His experience as an Engineer stood him in good stead.</p>
<p>He modified his plans somewhat on the advice of the  smart young builder; but the alterations were to be carried out very much upon  his own original lines &mdash; the builder&rsquo;s modifications were chiefly in detail.  And then they had to fight out the question of time. The builder asked for six  months; Bothwell would only grant four. Finally, time and cost were settled;  everything was agreed upon; Bothwell having given up his original idea of being  his own builder and buying his own materials; and the contract was to be taken  to Camelford next day, to be put into legal form. For four hundred and fifty  pounds the old cottage was to be transformed into a comfortable house. The two  little parlours and the kitchen were to be made into three little studies or  bookrooms, communicating with each other. These were for Bothwell and his  pupils to work in. A new drawing-room, dining-room, and kitchen were to be  built, and over these three good bedrooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall add a billiard-room with a large nursery  over it later on, when I am beginning to make my fortune,&rdquo; thought Bothwell. &ldquo;I  know we shall want a billiard-room; and I hope we shall want a nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The builder had gone home to his young wife and  baby, in a cheerful red-brick cottage of his own construction; and Bothwell was  pacing the old neglected garden alone, in the autumn sunset, when he looked up  suddenly, and saw a dark figure standing in the narrow path between him and the  rosy western sky.</p>
<p>It was the tall slender figure of a woman, robed in  black and thickly veiled. That black figure seemed to shut out all the warmth  and beauty of the glowing west. Bothwell&rsquo;s heart grew cold within him at sight  of it.</p>
<p>He had not a moment&rsquo;s doubt or hesitation, though  the woman&rsquo;s face was hardly visible under the thick crape veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Valeria!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, in the name of all that&rsquo;s reasonable, did you  come here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pair of post-horses brought me; that was easy  enough when I knew where to find you. I heard at Bodmin Road station that you  were here. You had been seen to drive by, and you told the station-master where  you were going.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter20"></a>Chapter 20<br>
  Two Women</h2>
<p>They stood face to face in the evening light,  Bothwell and Valeria; those two who had loved each other, who had once been  wont to meet with smiles and gladness, hand clasped in hand &mdash; they stood pale  and silent, each waiting for the other to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you do so mad a thing as to come here,  Lady Valeria?&rdquo; Bothwell asked, at last.</p>
<p>His heart was beating passionately, not with love,  but with anger. He was indignant at the unfeminine feeling shown by this  pursuit of him, this persecution of a man who had frankly owned a new and wiser  attachment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not the first madness I have been guilty of  for your sake,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There was the madness of loving you, in the  first instance; and the still greater madness of being constant to you; even  when I suspected that you had grown tired of me. But it was not weariness of me  that influenced you, was it, Bothwell? It was the false position which grew  irksome; the falsehood towards that good, brave man. It was that which made you  desert me, was it not? That is all over now. My bondage is over. I am my own  mistress, answerable to no one for my conduct; and I am here to remind you of  old vows made three years ago beside the fountain at Simla.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those old vows have been cancelled, Lady Valeria,&rdquo;  said Bothwell coldly. &ldquo;Surely you have not forgotten our last parting, and the  old love-token which you threw away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beside myself with anger,&rdquo; she answered  hurriedly. &ldquo;You could not have meant all you said that day, Bothwell. You  wanted to escape from a false position; you could not guess that my release was  to come so soon, that in less than a month I should be free, that in a year I  might be your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;for pity&rsquo;s sake not another  word. I am engaged to marry another woman &mdash; bound heart and soul to another. I  have no other purpose in life but to win her, and to be happy with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Valeria looked at him in silence for some  moments. She had thrown back her veil when she first addressed him. Her face  was almost as white as the crape border of her widow&rsquo;s bonnet, but on each  cheek there was one spot of hectic &mdash; a spot that looked like flame &mdash; and in her  eyes, there was the light of anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true, then! You are in love with another  woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true. I am in love with her; and I am bound  to her by all those feelings which are sweetest and most sacred in the mind of  a man &mdash; by gratitude, by love, by respect, by admiration for her noble  qualities. I am to be married to her almost immediately. You can understand,  therefore, Lady Valeria, that as I hope always to be your friend &mdash; your  champion and defender, if need of championship should ever arise &mdash; I am  justified in remonstrating with you for your folly in coming here alone, upon  the day after your husband&rsquo;s funeral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My champion, my friend!&rdquo; she repeated mockingly.  &ldquo;What amazing generosity, what sublime chivalry! You offer me your friendship &mdash;  you who swore to be my husband, to give me the devotion of your life, whenever  it pleased God to set me free from an unnatural union. You who were bound to me  by the most sacred vows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You released me from those vows when you threw  away the love-token. I asked you for my freedom, and you told me that I was  free. You cannot recall that release, Lady Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I released you from a false position. That is over  now: and your alleged motive &mdash; your compunction, your remorse of conscience &mdash;  must be over too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell was silent. He had said all that could be  said. He stood before Lady Valeria motionless, dumb, ready to bear the brunt of  her anger and submit meekly to her reproaches, were they never so ungenerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you have done for me?&rdquo; she  demanded passionately. &ldquo;Do you know what you have cost me &mdash; you who pretended  to be my slave, who pretended to worship me, and whose flimsy passion could not  stand the wear and tear of three short years? You have blighted my life; you  have ruined my good name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That last charge cannot be true, Lady Valeria. You  were much too careful of your reputation &mdash; you knew much too well how to keep  your slave at a proper distance,&rdquo; answered Bothwell, with a touch of scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I did not know how to hide my love for you.  There were eyes keen enough to read that. Do you know that my husband assaulted  Sir George Varney in his own house on my account?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then the story was true,&rdquo; muttered Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard about it, I see. Did you hear the  nature of the insult which provoked that punishment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the mention of your name &mdash; your name flung  in my face like an accusation &mdash; cast at me as if my position were notorious &mdash;  as if all society knew that I had been guilty of an intrigue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir George is a blackguard, and no act of his  would surprise me; but Sir George is not society. You need not be unhappy about  any speech of his. If you want me to call him out, I am quite willing to go  over to Blankenberghe and ask him to meet me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that such an act as that would intensify  the scandal. No, Bothwell, there is only one way in which you can set me right,  a year hence, when my year of widowhood is over, when I can marry again without  disrespect to my husband&rsquo;s memory. That is the only way of setting me right  with the world, Bothwell; and it is the only way of setting me right in my own  self-esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lady Valeria, I wonder that you have not  learnt to understand society better &mdash; you, who are essentially a woman of  society. Do you think the world would applaud you or respect you for making a  very poor marriage &mdash; for uniting yourself to a man without pursuit or means or  position? You, who with beauty, rank, and wealth, might marry almost any one  you pleased. The world does not smile on such marriages, Lady Valeria. The  world worships the star which mounts higher in the social firmament, not the  star which bends earthward. You have your future before you, free and  unfettered. You have wealth, which in this age means power. You can have  nothing to regret in a foolish love of the past, love that drooped and died for  want of a congenial atmosphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your last word upon this subject?&rdquo; asked  Valeria, looking at him intently with those angry eyes.</p>
<p>They were beautiful even in anger, those  violet-dark eyes; but the light in them was a diabolical light, as of an evil  spirit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My very last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we will say no more; and we will enter upon a  new phase of our existence &mdash; the period of friendship. Perhaps you will be kind  enough to take me back to the inn where I left my carriage, and order some tea  for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very happy,&rdquo; said Bothwell quietly; and  they walked off towards the inn, which was less than half a mile from the  cottage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what you were doing in that deserted  garden?&rdquo; inquired Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been planning the improvement of my future  home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! You are going to live in that desolate  spot, with nothing but the sea and the sky to look at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sea and the sky, and some of the finest  coast-scenery in England &mdash; the sands and the rocks and the wild hills. Don&rsquo;t  you think that ought to be enough for any man to look at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a hermit, no doubt, not for a man. A man  should have the city and the Forum. Ah, Bothwell, if you were my husband, there  would be no limit to my ambition for you! And you are going to vegetate in a  place like this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to work here, and to be useful in my generation,  I hope. I shall help to make the soldiers of the future;&rdquo; and then he told Lady  Valeria his plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a drudgery!&rdquo; she exclaimed; &ldquo;what a wearisome  monotonous round, from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end! I would as soon be a horse in  a mill. O Bothwell, the very idea is an absurdity. You a schoolmaster! You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She measured him from head to foot with a scornful  laugh; trying to humiliate him, to make him ashamed of his modest hopes. But  she failed utterly in this endeavour. Bothwell was too happy to be easily put  out of conceit with his prospects. Even that opprobrious name of &ldquo;schoolmaster&rdquo;  had no terrors for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about my friend&rsquo;s last illness,&rdquo; he said  presently, gravely, gently, anxious to bring Lady Valeria to a more womanly  frame of mind.</p>
<p>He thought that she must surely have some touch of  tenderness, some regret for the husband who had been so good and loyal in his  treatment of her; the man to whom she had been as an indulged and idolised  daughter rather than as a wife; escaping all wifely servitude, seeking her own  pleasure in all things, allowed to live her own life.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria told Bothwell about those last sad  days: how the strong frame had been burnt up with fever, the broad chest racked  with pain; how patiently weakness and suffering had been endured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was a brave, good man,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;noble,  unselfish to the last. His parting words were full of love and generosity. &lsquo;You  will marry again,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have left no fetter upon your life. My latest  prayer will be for your happiness.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had both been worthier of his regard,&rdquo;  said Bothwell gloomily.</p>
<p>He wondered at the supreme egotism of a nature  which could be so little moved by this good man&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is past wishing now. Nothing that you or I  can do will cancel the past. No, Bothwell,&rdquo; she said, looking at him steadily,  &ldquo;nothing will cancel the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at the hotel by this time. Bothwell  ordered tea, then went out to the stables to order the carriage. He left Lady  Valeria to take her tea in mournful solitude, while he walked up and down in  front of the hotel, waiting to hand her into her carriage. He was indignant  with her for the unwomanly step she had taken. He wondered that he could ever  have cared for such a woman, a woman who could assume the dignity of an  empress, and yet stoop to follies at which a dressmaker&rsquo;s apprentice might have  hesitated; a creature of caprice and impulse, governed by no higher law than  her own whim.</p>
<p>He walked up and down in the autumn darkness,  listening to the murmur of the waves, seeing the stars shine out, pale and far  apart in the calm gray, glancing now and then at the window of the  sitting-room, where Lady Valeria was seated in the glow of the fire, a tall  slim figure in densest black.</p>
<p>She came out after the carriage had been waiting  some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, you are there, are you?&rdquo; she exclaimed, seeing  Bothwell by the hotel-door. &ldquo;I thought you had gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited to hand you to your carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are vastly polite. I hardly expected so much  attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a train from Bodmin Road a few minutes  after nine. You will be in time for it if your coachman drives pretty fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road is not the safest in the world for fast  driving, but you can tell him to catch the train, if you please. Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell told the coachman not to waste his time  when he had a level road; and as the habit of Cornish coachmen is to spring  their horses up-hill and canter them gaily down-hill, there was every chance  that Lady Valeria would be in time.</p>
<p>The carriage drove off, and Bothwell went back to  his lodgings, wondering whether he had seen the last of the lady. Her coming  had introduced a new element of doubt and fear into his mind. A woman capable  of such foolishness might stop at no desperate act. All the serenity of  Bothwell&rsquo;s sky had become clouded over.</p>
<p>He turned his face in the direction of Penmorval,  and looked across the hills, through the cool, dark night. O, what a different  nature that was, the nature of the girl who was to be his wife! What rest, what  comfort in the very thought of her love!</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless you, my darling,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;I  send my love and blessing to you, dearest, over the quiet hills, under the  silent stars.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter21"></a>Chapter 21<br>
  Roses On A Grave</h2>
<p>While Bothwell was watching the builder&rsquo;s men upon  the green hill beside the Atlantic, Edward Heathcote was slowly, patiently,  laboriously following the thin thread of circumstantial evidence which was to  lead him to the solution of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s fate. He had taken this task upon  himself in purest chivalry, an uncongenial duty, entered upon in unselfish  devotion to the woman he loved. He pursued it now with a passionate zest, a  morbid interest, which was a new phase in his character. Never had he followed  the doublings of some cunning old dog-fox across the moors and heaths of his native  land with such intensity as he followed that unknown murderer of L&eacute;onie  Lemarque. That she had been murdered &mdash; deliberately sacrificed &mdash; as the one  witness of a past crime, was now his conviction. He had ceased to halt between  two opinions. L&eacute;onie had gone to meet the murderer of her aunt, and she had  fallen a victim to the folly of the dying woman who had sent her to seek  protection from such a source.</p>
<p>Who was that murderer, and for what reason had he  carried his helpless prey to a remote Cornish valley? Why should he not have  tried to get rid of her in the great wilderness of London, where the crime  would have excited much less curiosity, and would have been less likely to be  discovered?</p>
<p>Entering deliberately into the thoughts of the  assassin, following out the working of his mind, his fears, his calculations,  his artifices, it seemed to Heathcote that a man familiar with the line between  Plymouth and Penzance might scheme out just such a murder as that which had  been committed, might fix on the very spot at which the deed was to be done,  knowing that at that particular point the palisades had been removed, and the  viaduct left unprotected. He would speculate that the fall of a strange girl at  such a spot would be accepted as purely accidental. He would trust to his own  cleverness for finding the way to disconnect himself from the catastrophe; he  would imagine that in the hurry and confusion following such an event it would  be impossible for the murderer to be identified. Who was to select from all the  travellers in a train that one traveller whose arm had thrust the girl to her  doom? A little cleverness and watchfulness on his part would render such  identification impossible. A man provided with a railway key could get from one  carriage to another easily enough, in the surprise and horror of the moments  following upon the girl&rsquo;s fall. Few men are quite masters of their senses  during such moments, and all eyes would be turned towards the gorge at the  bottom of which the girl was lying; everybody&rsquo;s thought would be as to whether  she was living or dead. Very easy in such a moment for an active man to pass  from one carriage to the other, unobserved by any creature in or about the  train.</p>
<p>Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein&rsquo;s remark about the hidden door in  the alcove had impressed Heathcote strongly: the door opening into a dark and  obscure court, a narrow passage piercing from one street to another, and with  only a side door here and there leading into a yard, and here and there the  grated windows of a warehouse or an office; an alley in which, after business  hours, there were hardly any signs of human habitation. Heathcote inspected  this passage after he left the merchant&rsquo;s office. He followed it to its outlet  into a narrow street, which led him into another and busier street parallel  with the Rue Lafitte. A curious fancy possessed him; and he made his way, by  narrow and obscure streets, behind the Grand Opera and the Grand Hotel, into  the Rue Lafitte. By this way, which was somewhat circuitous, and which led for  the most part through shabby streets, he avoided the Boulevard altogether.</p>
<p>That speech of Mr. Bl&uuml;menlein&rsquo;s haunted him, like  the refrain of a song. The words repeated themselves over and over again in his  mind, with maddening reiteration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wyllard, the speculator, was one man; but there  was another man of whom the world knew nothing, and who went out and came in  between dusk and dawn by that side door in the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a bold speculation on the part of the German  merchant, and might have very little foundation in reality: yet the fact that  such a side door had been made at Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s expense implied a desire for  independent egress and ingress, a wish to be free from the espionage of porters  and porters&rsquo; wives, to go out and come in unobserved, to have no comment made  upon the hours he kept.</p>
<p>For such a man as Wyllard had appeared in the eyes  of the world, for a hard-headed plodder, a moneymaking machine, this easy  access to the Boulevard and the pleasures of a Parisian midnight would have  been useless.</p>
<p>But for a man who led a double life, who was the  hard calculating man of business by day, and who at night took his revenge for  the toil and dulness of the money-grubber&rsquo;s career in the dissipations of the  gayest city in the world &mdash; for such a man the facility afforded by the side  door in the court would be invaluable.</p>
<p>Had Wyllard been such a man? Had Wyllard lived a  double life during the ten years of his Parisian existence?</p>
<p>Such a thing seemed to the last degree unlikely.  Difficult to suppose that he could have given his nights to pleasure and folly  &mdash; he who had succeeded as a foreigner in a field where native talent had so  often failed; he who had penetrated the innermost labyrinths of the financial  world, and had always been a winner in the hazardous game where the reckless  and the idle must inevitably end as losers; he who had the <em>flair</em> for successful enterprises which had been spoken of to  Heathcote as little short of inspiration; he who had been respected by the  cleverest men on the Paris Bourse, looked up to as the hardest worker and  keenest thinker among them all. No, such a man could not have given his nights  to pleasure, could not have rioted among foolish revellers betwixt midnight and  morning &mdash; to go back to his den in the early dawn, and to begin a new day, half  rested, bemused by wine and folly.</p>
<p>No, such a man could not have habitually lived the  Boulevard life, could not have been the associate of fools and light women. He  could not so have lived without the fact of his folly being known to everybody  in Paris. And Edward Heathcote had heard his rival praised for the sobriety and  steadiness of his life, wondered at as a miracle of industry and good conduct,  a man of one idea and one ambition. He had heard Julian Wyllard so spoken of by  men who knew their Paris. He had heard his character discussed and sifted years  ago, at the time of his marriage with Dora Dalmaine.</p>
<p>That Julian Wyllard could have lived a profligate  life was impossible; but that theory of a double life did not necessarily imply  dissipation or folly. What of a man who concealed from the world his inner  life, the life of passion and emotion, who abandoned himself in secretness and  obscurity to his all-absorbing love for a woman whom he dared not acknowledge  before society? Such a man might verily be said to lead a double life &mdash; and  Julian Wyllard might have been such a man.</p>
<p>Heathcote looked at his watch when he entered the  Rue Lafitte. He had walked the distance in a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>He had made a note of the number of the house in  which Marie Pr&eacute;vol had lived. It was 117, about half-way between the Boulevard  and the Rue Lafayette. It was to this house that he now directed his steps,  impelled by the desire to see the rooms in which the beautiful young actress  had lived &mdash; if it were possible to see them. In this dead season, when so many  of the residents of Paris were absent, there was just the chance that some  good-natured <em>concierge</em> &mdash; and the <em>concierge</em> is always amenable to the  gentle inducement of a five-franc piece &mdash; might consent to admit a respectable-looking  stranger to a view of the third floor of No. 117.</p>
<p>The house was a quiet reputable-looking house  enough &mdash; one of the older and smaller houses of the street, untouched by the  hand of improvement, and of somewhat shabby appearance externally.</p>
<p>The person who opened the door, and who occupied a  little den at the back of the entrance-hall, was a woman of about forty,  cleaner and fresher looking than the generality of portresses and caretakers.  She was decently attired in a smart cotton gown, which fitted her buxom figure  to perfection. Her face was clean, and her cap spotless. She had a pleasant  open countenance, and Heathcote felt that he might believe anything she told  him.</p>
<p>He asked if there were any apartments to be let in  the house.</p>
<p>No, the portress told him. There were only  old-established families living there. There had not been a floor to let for  three years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Not the third floor, for example?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But why does Monsieur inquire especially about  the third floor?&rdquo; the portress-asked, looking at him keenly with her bright  black eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess to having a particular curiosity about  the third floor,&rdquo; replied Heathcote, judging that frankness would serve him  best with this outspoken matron, &ldquo;and if by any chance the family were absent &mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur would like to indulge a morbid  curiosity,&rdquo; interrupted the portress, &ldquo;to see the rooms which were occupied by  a beautiful woman who was murdered. There was a time when I had twenty, forty,  fifty such applications in a day, when all the idlers in Paris came here to spy  about and to question. If the murder had been done in one of those very rooms  instead of in the wood, I should have made my fortune. As it was, people stared  and pried and touched things; as if the very curtains and the sofa cushions had  been steeped in blood. But that was ten years ago. I wonder that Monsieur  should feel any curiosity after all those years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were living in this house ten years ago, at  the time of the murder?&rdquo; questioned Heathcote eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur, and for three years before that. I  was with Madame Georges from the day she first entered this house to the day  she was carried out of it in her coffin. I am Barbe Leroux, born Girot. If you  have heard of the murder of Marie Pr&eacute;vol, you must have heard of Barbe Girot,  her servant. I was one of the chief witnesses before the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, I have read your evidence,&rdquo; replied  Heathcote. &ldquo;I am deeply interested in the history of that terrible murder, and  I rejoice in having met a lady who can, if she pleases, help me to unravel a  mystery which baffled the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame Leroux  contemptuously; &ldquo;the police are a parcel of no-great-things, or they would have  found the man who killed my mistress and Monsieur de Maucroix in a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provided that he stopped in Paris to be found. But  it seems evident that he got away from Paris, and instantly, or he would have  been taken red-handed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to know that he was in Paris long  after the murder,&rdquo; said Barbe decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason? Pray consider, Madame, that I am  brought to this house by no idle curiosity, no morbid love of the horrible. It  is my mission to discover the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol. Give me your  confidence, I entreat, Madame. You who loved your mistress must desire to see  her assassin punished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barbe Leroux shrugged her shoulders with an air of  doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know that, Monsieur. Yes, I loved my  mistress; but I pity her murderer. Come, we cannot talk in this passage all  day. Will you walk into my room, Monsieur, and seat yourself for a little  while? and then, if you are anxious to see the apartment in which that poor  lady lived, it may perhaps be managed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; said Heathcote, slipping a  napoleon into Barbe Leroux&rsquo;s broad palm.</p>
<p>Had it been half a napoleon she would have  considered herself repaid for ordinary civility; but the larger coin secured  extraordinary devotion. She would, in her own phrase, have thrown herself into  the fire for this gentlemanly stranger, whose hat and coat were so decidedly  English, but who spoke almost as a Parisian.</p>
<p>She ushered him into her little sitting-room, the  very sanctuary and stronghold of her domestic life, since there was a bed in a  curtained corner, while there was a cradle sunning itself in the few rays of  light which crept down the hollow square of brick and stone on which the window  opened. The <em>pot-au-feu</em> was simmering  on a handful of wood-ashes in a corner of the hearth; and Madame Leroux&rsquo;s  plethoric work-basket showed that she had been lately occupied in the repair of  a blue linen blouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leroux is one of the porters at the Central  Markets,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;It is a hard life, and the pay is small; but there  are perquisites, and between us we contrive to live and to put away a little  for the daughter there,&rdquo; with a nod and a smile in the direction of the cradle,  whence came the rhythmical breathing of a fat baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only one?&rdquo; inquired Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have lived in this house for thirteen  years, Madame Leroux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearer fourteen, Monsieur, when all is counted. I  was a dresser at the Porte-Saint-Martin when Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol first appeared  there. It was a wretched life &mdash; bad pay, late hours, hard work. I caught cold  from going to and fro on the winter nights, thinly clad; for I had an old  mother to support in those days, and I could not afford warm clothing. I had a  cough which tore me to pieces; but I dared not give up my employment, and my  fear was of being sent away on account of bad health. I had not a friend in  Paris to help me. Then it was, Monsieur, that Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol took pity on  me. She spoke about me to a doctor who used to come behind the scenes and was  on friendly terms with all the actors and actresses. She asked him to prescribe  for me; but he told her that medicines would be of no use in my case. I was  young, and I had a good constitution. All that was needed for my cure was  warmth and comfort. I was not to go out of doors after dark, or in bad weather,  if I wanted to cure myself. I almost laughed at the doctor for his advice. I  lived on the Boulevard de la Chapelle, and had to walk to and fro in all  weathers, good or bad. It was January at this time, and the snow was on the  ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was then that Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol took you into  her service?&rdquo; speculated Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur. There are not many ladies in her  position who would have cared what became of a drudge like me. She was new to  the theatre, and she had just become the rage on account of her beauty. The  papers had all been full of her praises. Cigars, hats, fans, shoes were called  after her. The public applauded her songs and dances madly every night.  Admirers were waiting in crowds at the stage-door to see her leave the theatre,  in the shabby little forty-sous that used to take her home. She dared not walk,  for fear of being followed and mobbed. She was young enough to have had her  head turned by all this fuss; but she seemed to care hardly anything about it.  One honest man&rsquo;s love would be worth all this rubbish, she said to me once,  when I asked her if she was not proud of being the rage with all Paris. I was  proud of dressing her; and I used to take the greatest care in everything I did  for her; and I suppose it was this that made her so good to me. She knew that I  loved her; and the poor dresser&rsquo;s love was honest love. In a word, Monsieur,  she asked me if I would like to be her servant. She was going to leave her  mother&rsquo;s lodgings, where she was not comfortable, and to take an apartment of  her own. I might have to work hard, perhaps, she told me, and I should have to  be careful and saving, as she had only her salary to live on. She was not like  those ladies who rolled their carriages and lived in the Bois yonder; but she  would feed me and lodge me well, and she would give me as much money as I was  getting at the theatre, without either food or lodging.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, you accepted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With delight, Monsieur. And three days after, I  came to this house. My young mistress had taken the third floor for five years.  The landlord put the rooms in order for her; and she furnished them very  modestly, scantily even, partly out of her little savings since she had been at  the theatre, partly on credit. She was to pay so many francs a week to the  upholsterer till all was paid for. She had no extravagant tastes, no craving for  finery or luxurious living. If you had seen her rooms in those days, you might  have thought them the rooms of a nun &mdash; all things so simple, so neat, so pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there came a change afterwards, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There came a time when Monsieur Georges loaded her  with presents, and the apartment changed gradually under his influence. He sent  her easy-chairs, velvet-coloured tables, a bookcase, an escritoire, satin  curtains, rich carpets, pictures, china, hothouse flowers. He showered his  gifts upon her; but I knew that she would have been better pleased to live in  her own simple way. She had a horror of seeming like those other ladies of the  theatre, with their luxurious houses and fine clothes. She spent very little  money on herself; she lived almost as plainly as a workman&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she called Madame Georges when she first came  to this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur; she did not even know the name of  Monsieur Georges at that time. She only knew that she had a mysterious admirer,  who came to the theatre every night, who used to sit in a dark corner of a  small private box close to the stage, who never showed himself to the audience,  and who was always alone. This was all she knew of Monsieur Georges in those  days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how their acquaintance advanced from  this point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur. I hardly know anything of the  progress of their attachment. There were letters &mdash; gifts &mdash; which came to the  house. And I know that, in the spring nights of that first year, my mistress  used to walk home from the theatre, escorted by Monsieur Georges. But he never  entered our apartment till after Madame&rsquo;s return from England, where she went  during the summer vacation. She had been very silent about her strange admirer  &mdash; she had told me nothing &mdash; but she had shed many tears on his account. That  was a secret which she could not hide from me. She had spent many wakeful  nights, breathed many sighs. When she told me she was going to England, I  thought all was over. She had fought hard to be true to herself, poor girl: she  had struggled against her fate: but this man&rsquo;s love had conquered her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did not tell you that she was going away to be  married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur; but when she came back, after a  fortnight&rsquo;s absence, she showed me her wedding-ring, and she told me that she  was to be called Madame Georges henceforward. This I took to mean that Monsieur  Georges had married her while in England, and I believe it still. He loved her  too well to degrade her by making her his mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loved her well enough to murder her,&rdquo; said  Heathcote. &ldquo;I suppose that is about the highest flight for a lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He loved her as women are not often loved,  Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Barbe, with conviction. &ldquo;I saw enough to know that from  first to last he adored her; that the jealousy which devoured him later &mdash; the  jealousy which made him act like a madman many times in my hearing &mdash; was the  madness of intense love. I have listened outside the door, trembling for my  mistress&rsquo;s safety, ready to give the alarm to the house, to rush in and rescue  her from his violence; and then the storm was lulled by her sweet words, her  gentleness, and he became like a penitent child. Yes, Monsieur, he loved her as  few men love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this were so, why did he keep her in such a  discreditable position? Why did he not introduce her to the world as his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot tell. There must have been reasons for  his secrecy. He seldom came to this house before nightfall. He never showed  himself anywhere with Madame till after the theatre.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since he was rich enough to be lavish, why did he  not remove her from the stage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was one of the causes of unhappiness towards  the last, Monsieur. It was his wish that she should leave the theatre, and she  refused. I believe it was at this time she became acquainted with Monsieur de  Maucroix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You stated before the <em>Juge d&rsquo;Instruction</em> that you believed the acquaintance between your  mistress and Monsieur de Maucroix to have been an innocent acquaintance. Is  that still your belief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my conviction, Monsieur. I never doubted my  dear mistress&rsquo;s honour, though I doubted her wisdom in allowing herself to  think about Monsieur de Maucroix. It must be pleaded for her excuse that he was  one of the most fascinating men in Paris. At least that is what I have heard  people say of him. I know that he was young, handsome, and remarkably elegant  in his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now tell me how you happen to know that  Georges remained in Paris after the murder? Did you ever see him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur. It is rather a long story. If I  were not afraid of tiring you &mdash;&rdquo; Madame Leroux began deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will not tire me. I want to hear every detail,  however insignificant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Monsieur, you must know that in consequence  of Madame&rsquo;s kindness and of the lavish generosity of Monsieur Georges, and also  by reason of a good many presents from Monsieur de Maucroix, who threw about  his money with full hands, I was very comfortably off at the time of Madame&rsquo;s  sad death. I had buried my poor mother two years before, and I had been able to  save almost every penny of my wages. I felt, therefore, independent of service.  The term would have to be paid by Madame Lemarque, who inherited all her  daughter&rsquo;s property, and as she had a horror of the rooms in which her poor  daughter had lived, and could not bear to be alone in them for an hour, she asked  me to stay till the end of the quarter. Then, as I told you, people came in  crowds to see the rooms; and as I had power to show them, or to refuse to show  them, just as I pleased, I need not tell you that I made a good deal of money  in this way. I did not make a trade of showing the rooms, Monsieur; I never  asked any one for money, but on the other hand I did not refuse it when it was  offered to me. This continued for some weeks; then came the sale. All the  handsome articles of furniture, all the pictures and ornaments, fetched high  prices. They were bought by fashionable people as souvenirs of the beautiful  Marie Pr&eacute;vol. But the plainer furniture, the things which my mistress had paid  for out of her own earnings, were sold for very little, and these I bought. I  had conferred with the landlord, and he had agreed to retain me as his tenant.  With the furniture which I bought at the sale, and with other things which I  picked up cheaply among the secondhand dealers, I contrived to make the rooms  very comfortable as furnished lodgings, and from that time to this I have  carried them on with reasonable profit. Three years later I was able to take  the fourth floor; and two years after that, on the second floor falling vacant,  I ventured to become tenant for that also. There remains only the first floor,  which is let to an old lady of ninety; and if Providence prospers Leroux and  me, we ought to be able to take the first floor by the time the old lady dies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will then be lessees of the whole house; a  bold speculation, Madame, but one which with your prudent habits will doubtless  succeed. But to return to this man Georges, whom you saw in Paris after the  murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was accustomed to go every week to the cemetery  of P&egrave;re Lachaise, Monsieur, to look at my dear mistress&rsquo;s grave, and to lay my  humble offering of flowers upon the marble slab which had been placed there at  Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s expense. It bore for inscription only the one word &mdash; Marie:  Madame Lemarque dared not describe her daughter as a wife &mdash; she would not  record her name as a spinster. Marie was enough. For the first month after her  burial I found the slab covered with flowers, wreaths, crosses, bouquets of the  costliest flowers that can be bought in Paris. I noticed that among the variety  of flowers there was one wreath frequently renewed, and always the same &mdash; a  wreath of Mar&eacute;chal Niel roses &mdash; and I knew that these had been her favourite  flowers, the flowers she always wore, and had about her in her rooms. I had  often heard her call the Mar&eacute;chal Niel the king of roses. Months passed, and on  my weekly visits with my poor little bunch of violets, or snowdrops, or  jonquils, I found always the wreath of yellow roses. All through the winter,  when even other token had ceased to adorn the grave &mdash; when the beautiful  actress was beginning to be forgotten &mdash; the yellow roses were always renewed. I  felt that this could be done only by some one who had devotedly loved Marie  Pr&eacute;vol. For her admirers of the theatre her death had been a nine days&rsquo; wonder.  They had covered her grave with flowers, and then had gone away and forgotten  all about her; but the wreath of yellow roses, renewed again and again, all  through the dark dull winter, was the gift of a steadfast love, a grief which  did not diminish with time. I questioned the people at the gates, but they knew  nothing of the hand which laid those flowers on my mistress&rsquo;s grave. I hoped I  should some day surprise the visitor who brought them; but though I altered the  days of my visits, never going two weeks running on the same day, I seemed no  nearer finding out that constant mourner. At last, early in the February after  my mistress&rsquo;s death, I resolved upon going to the cemetery every day, and  remaining there, in view of the grave, as long as my stock of patience would allow  me. I spent three or four hours there for six days running, till my heart and  my feet were alike weary. But I had seen no one: the roses had not been  renewed. The seventh day was a Saturday, the day I always devoted to cleaning  the apartment, which was now in the occupation of an elderly gentleman and his  wife. I was not able to leave the house till late in the afternoon. The day had  been foggy, and the fog had thickened by the time I left the omnibus, which  took me to the Rue de la Roquette. At the gates of the cemetery it was so dark  that if I had not been familiar with the paths which led to my mistress&rsquo;s  grave, I should hardly have been able to find my way to the spot. The grave is  in a narrow path, midway between two of the principal walks; and as I turned  the corner between two large and lofty monuments, I saw a man standing in the  middle of the path in front of Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s grave. A tall figure, in a furred  overcoat, a figure I knew well. I had not an instant&rsquo;s doubt that the murderer  of my mistress stood there before me, looking at his victim&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you accost him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, no! He was not more than a dozen yards from  the spot where I stood, and I quickened my footsteps, intending to speak to  him; but at the sound of those footsteps he looked round, saw a figure  approaching through the fog, and hurried off in the opposite direction. I ran  after him, but he had reached the other end of the path before I could overtake  him; and when I got there it was in vain that I looked for any trace of him either  right or left of the pathway. He had disappeared in the fog, which was thicker  at this end of the path, as it was on lower ground. My mistress&rsquo;s grave was on  the slope of the hill, and there the fog was less dense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went back to the grave and looked at the flowers  on the slab. A wreath of yellow roses, fresh from the hothouse where they had  been grown, lay on the marble, surrounding that one word &lsquo;Marie.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure that the man you saw was Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure. I knew his figure; I knew his  walk. I could not be mistaken in him. And who else was there in Paris who would  come week after week, in all weathers, to lay the roses my mistress loved upon  her grave? Many had admired her on the stage; but only two men had been allowed  to love her, to know anything of her in her private life. Of those two, one was  the murdered man, Maxime de Maucroix; the other was the murderer Georges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find the flowers renewed after this day,  or did the murderer take alarm and avoid the cemetery?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The roses were renewed week after week for more  than a year after that foggy Saturday afternoon; but I never again saw the  person who laid them there. I had, indeed, no desire to see him again. I had  satisfied myself as to his identity. I did not want to betray him to the  police. The shedding of his blood might have avenged my dear mistress&rsquo;s death,  but it could not have restored her to life. It could have been no consolation  to her in purgatory to know that this man, whom she had once loved, who had  loved her only too well, was to die on the scaffold for her sake. I hated him  as the murderer of my mistress, but I pitied him even in the midst of my  hatred. I pitied him for the reality of his love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say the flowers appeared on the grave for more  than a year after that February afternoon?&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Did the tribute  fall off gradually? Was the wreath renewed at longer and longer intervals till  it ceased altogether, or did the offering stop suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly. In the March of the second year after  Madame&rsquo;s death I found a faded wreath on my weekly visit, and that faded wreath  has never been replaced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be in March 1874?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never saw Georges again, either in the  cemetery or anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been told that he was a French Canadian.  Have you any knowledge as to his country or his family history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, Monsieur. I always supposed him to be a  Frenchman. I never heard him speak in any other language.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he speak like a Parisian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Monsieur. He did not speak exactly like the  people about here, or the actors at the Porte-Saint-Martin. I used to think  that he was a provincial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you hear from your mistress what part of  England she had visited?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard, Monsieur, but have forgotten. The names  of places were strange to me &mdash; such queer names &mdash; but I know it was a place in  which there were lakes and mountains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it in Scotland or Ireland?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it was in England. I am sure of that. And now,  if Monsieur would like to see the third floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote said he was most anxious to do so; and he  followed Madame Leroux up-stairs, to a landing out of which the door of the  apartment opened. The rooms were small and low, but well lighted, and with a  balcony looking out on the street. The little <em>salon</em> was neatly furnished, with those very chairs and tables which  Marie Pr&eacute;vol had bought out of her first economies as an actress. The things  were meagre and shabby after the wear and tear of years; but the perfect  neatness and cleanliness of everything made amends. Barbe Leroux was one of  those admirable managers who by sheer industry and good taste can make much out  of little.</p>
<p>There was a tiny dining-room opening out of the <em>salon</em>, with a window overlooking  chimneys and backs of houses, and this window had been filled with painted  glass in the time of Monsieur Georges. All the other elegances and luxuries  with which he had embellished the cosy little rooms had been disposed of at the  sale of Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s effects. There had been Venetian mirrors and girandoles  on the walls of the dining-room, Barbe explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame used to light all the wax candles when she  came in from the theatre. There were candles on the supper-table with  rose-coloured shades. There were fruit and flowers always. Everything was made  to look pretty in honour of Monsieur Georges &mdash; and there had to be some  delicate little dish for supper, and choicest wine. Monsieur was not a man who  cared much what he ate or drank; but Madame wished that everything should be  nicely arranged, that the supper-table should look as inviting as at the Caf&eacute;  de Paris or at the Maison d&rsquo;Or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bedroom opened out of the <em>salon</em>. There was a dressing-room between that and the little back  room in which Barbe had slept, when she was in Mademoiselle Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s service.  On her occasional visits L&eacute;onie Lemarque had occupied a truckle-bed in Barbe&rsquo;s  room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it that L&eacute;onie Lemarque in all her visits  never happened to see Monsieur Georges?&rdquo; inquired Heathcote, when he had looked  at all the rooms, peopling them in his imagination with the figures of the  actress and her lover.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame took good care to prevent that. She told me  that Monsieur Georges hated children, and that the little one was to be kept  out of his way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he never spend his mornings here? Was he only  here at night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only at night. It was for that reason Madame  Lemarque used to call him the night-bird. I think she was very angry because  she was never allowed to see him &mdash; never invited to supper. Monsieur Georges  used to take a cup of coffee early in the morning, and he left the house before  most people were up. As early as five o&rsquo;clock in summer, never later than  half-past six in winter.&rdquo;</p>

  Wedding Garments</h2>
<p>Hilda&rsquo;s presence at Penmorval was full of comfort  and solace for Dora Wyllard. She had known Hilda all her life, had seen her  grow from childhood to womanhood, had loved her with a sisterly love, trusting  her as she trusted no one else. Hilda had been only a child at the time of  Dora&rsquo;s engagement to Edward Heathcote; yet, even at eleven years of age,  Hilda&rsquo;s tender heart had been full of sympathy for her brother when that  engagement was broken off, and when Dora became the wife of another man. She  had been angry, with vehement, childish anger. That Dora should like any man  better than him who, in the fond eyes of the younger sister, seemed the prince  and pattern of fine gentlemen, was an unpardonable offence.</p>
<p>Hilda at eleven was precocious in her knowledge of  books, and very self-opinionated in her judgment of people. She told her  brother she would never speak to Dora again, that she would run a mile to avoid  even seeing her: and then, a few months after Dora&rsquo;s marriage, finding that her  brother had forgiven that great wrong with all his heart, Hilda melted one day  suddenly, at meeting Mrs. Wyllard on the moor, and fell into her old friend&rsquo;s  arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have tried to hate you for being so wicked to my  brother,&rdquo; she sobbed, as Dora bent over her and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your brother forgave me ever so long ago, Hilda,&rdquo;  said Dora. &ldquo;Why should you be less generous than he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I love him better than he loves himself,&rdquo;  cried Hilda, in her vehement way; &ldquo;because I know his value better than he  does. O Dora, how could you like any one else better than Edward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not ask me that, my darling. Those things  cannot be explained. Fate willed it so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I suppose you are very happy in your grand  house?&rdquo; said Hilda sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy with the husband I love, Hilda.  The grand house makes no difference. And now we are going to be good friends,  aren&rsquo;t we, dear? and we are never going to talk of the past. How you have  grown, Hilda!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of all my frocks,&rdquo; answered Hilda, glancing  contemptuously at her ankles. &ldquo;It is perfectly degrading never to have a frock  long enough for one &mdash; and never to have one&rsquo;s waist in the right place. The  dressmaker says I have no waist yet. Dressmakers are so insulting to girls of  my age. I think I shall positively trample upon my dressmaker when I am grown  up, to revenge myself for all I have suffered from the tribe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Hilda, what an old-fashioned puss you have  grown!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I help being old-fashioned? I never see  any young people. Edward never comes to The Spaniards now. You have driven him  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilda, if we are to be friends&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t say it again; but you have, you  know. It is awfully dull at home. I suppose I may say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear you have a new governess. I hope you like  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t hope that, for you know girls never  do. She is a poor sheep of a thing, and I don&rsquo;t suppose I hate her quite so  much as some girls hate their governesses. But she is dreadfully dreary. She  makes her own gowns; and of an evening her needle goes stitch, stitch, stitch,  in time to the ticking of the clock, while I practise my scales. I don&rsquo;t know  which I hate most, the clock, or the piano, or the needle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Hilda, you must spend half your time with me  in future. I shall call to-morrow, and ask your father&rsquo;s permission to have you  at Penmorval as often as I like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t refuse, if there&rsquo;s any consistency in  him,&rdquo; replied Hilda, &ldquo;for he is always grumbling about the noise I make, and  about my sliding down the banisters. How did <em>he</em> go downstairs I wonder, at my age? Those broad banisters at The  Spaniards must have been made for sliding. But fathers are so inconsistent,&rdquo;  concluded Hilda. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if he wouldn&rsquo;t rather have me and my noise  at home than allow me to be happy at Penmorval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope that he will be reasonable,&rdquo; said  Dora, smiling, &ldquo;even though he is a father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Wyllard called at The Spaniards next day, and  was not too graciously received by Mr. Heathcote &mdash; old Squire Heathcote, as he  was called in that part of the world. He was a testy invalid, a sufferer from  some chronic complaint which was so obscure in its complications as to seem  only an excuse for ill-temper, and he had not forgiven Dora for jilting his  son. He softened gradually, however, melted by the sweetness of her manner, and  by memories of days that were gone, when he had admired her mother, and had  been ruthlessly cut out by her father. The eyes that looked at him seemed to be  the eyes that he had loved in his youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you care to be troubled with the girl, I ought  to be grateful for any kindness you may show her,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;She makes  more noise than a regiment, and she is always disobeying her governess, or  neglecting her lessons; and then I am called upon to interfere. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind  if they would fight it out between them, and leave me in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall be left in peace very often, if you will  allow me to have Hilda for my little companion at Penmorval,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;And I  promise you that her education shall not be altogether neglected while she is  with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can teach her manners, I shall be eternally  your debtor,&rdquo; said the Squire. &ldquo;I would much rather a young woman should know  how to behave herself in society than that she should be able to read &AElig;schylus  or take a degree in mathematics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus it came about that Hilda spent a great deal of  her life at Penmorval, where the sheep-like governess escorted her, or whence  she fetched her with unfailing patience, grateful exceedingly when she was  rewarded with a cup of tea in Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s pretty drawing-room, or in the  yew-tree arbour.</p>
<p>And thus in the seven happy years of Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s  married life &mdash; her apprenticeship, as she had called it playfully last June,  when the anniversary of her marriage came round &mdash; Hilda had been her chief  companion. The girl had grown up at the young matron&rsquo;s side as a younger  sister, and had been a link between Dora and Edward, albeit these two saw each  other but seldom, for Edward&rsquo;s home had been in the neighbourhood of Plymouth  until within the last two years.</p>
<p>The old Squire did not long survive that interview  in which he complained of his young daughter&rsquo;s hoydenish manners. He did not  live to see the hoyden soften into a graceful, modest girl, reserved and silent  among strangers, full of vivacity among those she loved. His elder son  succeeded him in the possession of The Spaniards, a bachelor, and an  enthusiastic sportsman. He was one of those ideal brothers with whom a sister  can do just what she likes; and under his <em>r&eacute;gime</em> Hilda learnt to ride to hounds, and contrived to enjoy herself as much as any  girl in Cornwall. She mourned him passionately when he was snatched away in the  flower of his manhood, victim to a cold caught during a fishing tour in  Connemara.</p>
<p>Edward&rsquo;s rule was almost as kind, but not quite so  easy. He had narrower ideas about the rights of young ladies, especially in  relation to the hunting-field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I hunt you can go with me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I  will not have you flourishing about the country with no one but a groom to look  after you;&rdquo; and this narrower rule deprived Hilda of many a day&rsquo;s sport.  Courtenay, the elder brother, had never missed a day with fox-hounds or  harriers, and he had allowed his sister the run of his stables, and much  latitude in all things.</p>
<p>While Hilda was growing up under Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s  wing, while Edward Heathcote changed from bachelor to married man, and then to  widower, Bothwell Grahame was serving his Queen and his country in the far  East. He could just remember having seen Hilda now and again as a child. He  came back to Cornwall to find her a woman, or a girl on the verge of womanhood;  and it was not long before he grew to believe in her as the very perfection of  girlhood and womanhood in one &mdash; girlhood when she was gay, and in her more  serious moods altogether womanly.</p>
<p>In these darker days, under that heavy cloud which  had fallen upon Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s life, Hilda&rsquo;s presence was an inestimable  blessing. Dora was able to put aside the thought of her own great sorrow every  now and then, while she entered with all her heart into the life of her young  friend &mdash; this fresh young life, so full of hope in the future, of earnest  purpose and sweet humility. If a king had stooped from his throne to woo her,  Hilda could not have been prouder of her royal lover than she was of Bothwell.  She spoke of him as of one who honoured her by his affection, and she seemed  full of fearfulness lest she should not be good enough for her hero. It never  occurred to her that it was Bothwell who ought to be thankful, that it was he  who had won the prize.</p>
<p>There was a sweet self-abnegation in this girlish  love which touched Dora deeply, she being all unconscious of her unselfish  worship of her husband, her own surrender to the lover who stole her from her  betrothed.</p>
<p>Hilda was very fearful of intruding her new joys  and hopes upon her friend&rsquo;s sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought not to chatter about our prospects, Dora;  when you are so weighed down with care,&rdquo; she said apologetically.</p>
<p>But Dora insisted upon hearing all about the new  home which was to be made out of the old cottage. She insisted upon discussing  the trousseau and the linen-closet, glass and china, and even hardware; albeit  her own lines had fallen in a mansion where all these things were provided on a  lavish scale, and left to the care of a housekeeper, to be destroyed and  renewed periodically, for the benefit of old-established tradesmen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never had a linen-closet to look after, Dora,&rdquo;  said Hilda, pitying her friend. &ldquo;That is the worst of being so rich. There is  no individuality in your home-life. I mean to be a regular Dutch housewife, and  to keep count of every table-cloth in my stock. I shall make and mark and mend  all the house-linen; and I shall be much prouder of my linen-closet than of my  gowns and bonnets. And the china-closet, Dora, ought not that to be lovely? One  can get such delicious glass and china nowadays for so little money. I have  looked at the Plymouth china-shops, and longed to buy the things, before I was  engaged; and now I can buy all the glass and china for our house &mdash; I have saved  enough money out of my allowance to pay for all we want in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an independent young person you are, Hilda!&rdquo;  said her friend, laughing at her; &ldquo;but you must not spend all your money on  cups and saucers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And teapots!&rdquo; interjected Hilda&mdash; &ldquo;such sweet  little china teapots. I will have one for every day in the week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teapots are all very well; but you will have your  trousseau to buy. You must keep some of your money for frocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no end of frocks; more than enough,&rdquo;  protested Hilda. &ldquo;I shall buy just two new gowns &mdash; my wedding-gown, and a  tailor gown for riding outside coaches in the honeymoon. Bothwell proposes that  we should go round the south coast as far as the Start, and then across country  to Hartland, and home by Bude. That is to be our honeymoon tour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice, and very inexpensive, dearest. And then  you are to come here to live till your new home is ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid we shall be very much in your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be a comfort to me, Hilda; both you and  Bothwell will be a help and comfort to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda spent her evenings for the most part in the  invalid&rsquo;s room. Her sympathetic nature made it easy for her to adapt herself to  the necessities of a sick-room. She could be very quiet, and yet she could be  bright and gay. She could be cheerful without being noisy. She sang with  exquisite taste, and sang the songs which are delightful to all hearers &mdash; songs  that appeal to the heart and soothe the senses.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard was particularly fond of her German  ballads &mdash; Schubert, Mendelssohn, Jensen, old Volks-Lieder; but once when she  began a little French song, &ldquo;Si tu savais,&rdquo; he stopped her with a painful  motion of his distorted hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that, Hilda. I detest that song;&rdquo; and for the  first time Hilda doubted the excellence of his judgment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder you dislike it,&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, the thing is pretty enough; but it has been so  vulgarised. All the organs were grinding it when I lived in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And those organs disturbed you at your work  sometimes, perhaps,&rdquo; said Dora, seated in her accustomed place beside his  pillow, ready to adjust his reading-lamp, to give him a new book, or to discuss  any passage he showed her. He read immensely in those long hours of enforced  captivity, but his reading had been chiefly on one particular line. He was  reading the metaphysicians, from Plato and Aristotle to Schopenhauer and  Hartmann; trying to find comfort for the anguish of his own individual position  in the universal despondency of modern metaphysics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man chained to a sick-bed ought to be able to  console himself with the notion that the great world around him is only an idea  of his own brain; and yet even when convinced of the unreality of all things,  there remains this one central point in the universe, the sense of personal  pain. Such a belief might reconcile the sufferer to the idea of suicide, but  hardly to the idea of existence. Ah, my Dora, if you are only a phantasm, you  are the sweetest ghost that ever a man&rsquo;s brain invented to haunt and bless his  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think you might read more interesting  books while you are ill, Julian?&rdquo; suggested his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear. These books are best, for they set me  thinking upon abstract questions, and hinder me from brooding upon my own  misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could Dora say to him by way of comfort,  knowing too well that this misery of his was without hope on earth; knowing  that this burden of pain which had fallen upon him must be carried to the very  end; that day by day and hour by hour the gradual progress of decay must go on;  no pause, no respite; decay so slow as to be almost imperceptible, save on  looking back at what had been?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God the brain is untouched,&rdquo; said Julian  Wyllard, when his wife pitied him in his hours of suffering. &ldquo;I should not have  cared to sink into imbecility, to have only a dull vague sense of my own  identity, like a vegetable in pain. I am thankful that Spencer assures me the  brain is sound, and is likely to outlast this crippled frame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell rode over on Sunday morning as he had  threatened, and appeared at the parish church with his cousin and Hilda, much  to the astonishment of some of the parishioners who had suspected and almost  condemned him. They were now veering round, and had begun to inform each other  that Mr. Grahame had been a much-wronged man, and that there was evidently a  great deal more in the mystery of the strange girl&rsquo;s death than any one in  Bodmin had yet been able to fathom. No doubt Mr. Distin, the famous criminal  lawyer, knew all about it, and his cross-examination of Bothwell Grahame had  been only a blind to throw the press and the public off the right scent. The  very fact of his coming all the way from London to attend a Cornish inquest  argued an occult knowledge, a shadow behind the throne. Some among Bothwell&rsquo;s  late detractors hinted that the business involved a personage of very high  rank, and were disposed to transfer their suspicions to a local peer, who was  not so popular as he might have been, having but recently refused to remit more  than one-third of his farmers&rsquo; rents, or to renew leases at less than half the  previous rental, while he was known to have narrow views about ground game.</p>
<p>And now Bodmin beheld Bothwell Grahame seated in  the Penmorval pew between his cousin and Hilda Heathcote, and Bodmin opined  that his engagement to Miss Heathcote must be a settled thing, since it was  known that he had taken a house at Trevena, and was building and improving  there on a large scale. There were some who approved, and some who condemned;  some who wondered that Squire Heathcote could allow his only sister to marry  such a reprobate, others who declared that Bothwell was a high-spirited fellow,  who had been a fine soldier, and would make a capital army-coach; but these  differences of opinion helped to sustain conversation, which sometimes sank to  a very low ebb in Bodmin for lack of matter.</p>
<p>It was a lovely autumn day, and Bothwell strolled  in the rose-garden with his sweetheart, between luncheon and five-o&rsquo;clock tea,  talking over their house and their future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, dearest, there is only one point to  settle,&rdquo; said Bothwell, when they had discussed furniture and china and glass  to their hearts&rsquo; content, and when Bothwell had given a graphic description of  sundry Chippendale chairs and Early-English bureaux which he had discovered and  bargained for in cottages and farmhouses within twenty miles of Trevena. &ldquo;I had  a little talk with Wyllard before luncheon. He is most cordially disposed  towards us; and he wants to hurry on our marriage in order that he may be  present at the ceremony. He feels just able to go down to the church in a  Bath-chair. His chair could be wheeled up the aisle, and placed within sight  and sound of the altar, without being in anybody&rsquo;s way. He says if we delay our  marriage he may no longer have the power to do even this much; and for this  reason he is urgent that we should marry almost immediately. What do you say,  dearest? Will you take up your burden as a poor man&rsquo;s wife? Will you be mine  soon; at once almost? The week after next, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Bothwell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think, dear love, there is nothing to delay our  marriage, except want of faith in each other, or in ourselves. If you have any  doubt of me, Hilda, or any doubt as to your own love for me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have none, Bothwell &mdash; not a shadow of doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us be married on Tuesday week. That is  the day Dora suggested. She tells me that you are the most sensible girl she  ever met with, and that you are not going to buy a wagon-load of clothes in  order to overdress your part in that old, old play called <em>Love in a Cottage</em>: so you see there is nothing to wait for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must have a wedding-gown, Bothwell, and a  gown for travelling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have just a week in which to get them  made, dear. Not an hour more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was some further discussion; but in the end  Hilda yielded to her lover&rsquo;s pleading. It should be any day he liked &mdash; it  should be Tuesday. The two gowns should be ordered next morning. Edward  Heathcote had given Dora full powers, and he would doubtless hurry home at her  bidding in time to arrange the terms of Hilda&rsquo;s marriage-settlement, and to be  present at the wedding.</p>
<p>Bothwell was almost beside himself with gladness  for the rest of the day; but good-feeling impelled him to restrain his  exuberance, and to be grave and quiet in the presence of the patient sufferer,  whose pale calm face told but little of mental struggle or bodily pain. The  evening was spent in Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s room. There was a good deal of  conversation, and Hilda sang some of her favourite songs; a sacred song of  Gounod&rsquo;s, &ldquo;There is a green hill far away,&rdquo; which Dora especially loved, and  again, &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; by the same composer. Bothwell sat in a corner by the  pretty little cottage piano, listening to the rich full voice of his beloved, watching  her slender fingers as they strayed over the keys, ineffably happy. He had no  thought of evenings in the years that were gone, when he had listened to  another singer, and watched other hands, delicate nervous fingers, glittering  with diamonds. The voice of that old time was a thinner voice, a somewhat reedy  soprano, and those tapering fingers had something of a bird&rsquo;s claws in their  extreme attenuation; but he had thought the thin voice passing sweet in the  days that were gone, and the hand of the siren had seemed to him a thing of  beauty.</p>
<p>He left Penmorval soon after daybreak next morning,  to ride back to Trevena. He was to return on the following Saturday to take up  his abode there until the wedding-day; while Hilda was to go back to The  Spaniards almost immediately, to collect her belongings, and make herself ready  for her new life. All the business of furnishing could be done after the  wedding, in that interval which the young couple were to spend at Penmorval.</p>
<p>Hilda was up in time to watch from her bedroom  window while her lover rode away in the misty morning; but she was much too shy  to go downstairs and wish him good-bye. She would have quailed before the awful  eye of Stodden, the butler, had she ventured to show herself at such an  unseemly hour, unchaperoned, unsanctioned by the presence of a matron. So she  hid behind the window-curtain, and watched her true knight&rsquo;s departure, and did  not even fling him a flower by way of love-token.</p>
<p>When horse and rider were out of sight, Hilda went  to her desk and wrote to her brother, urging him to come back without delay,  explaining and apologising for the early date named for her wedding &mdash; reminding  him as to her marriage-settlement that she wished Bothwell to profit as much as  possible by her small independence &mdash; an altogether womanly letter, brimming  over with love for her betrothed.</p>
<p>She went home that morning, and she and Fr&auml;ulein  Meyerstein began immediately to busy themselves with preparations for the  wedding. It would naturally be the quietest of weddings, since Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s  condition forbade all festivity. Hilda said she would have the twins for her  bridesmaids, and no others. They were to be dressed exactly alike, and all in  pure white, like biscuit-china figures; they were to have little Pompadour frocks  and petticoats and mob-caps. There was a tremendous consultation that Monday  afternoon with the chief dressmaker of Bodmin, a person of high reputation  among those steady old-fashioned people who liked to spend their money in their  own town, and who were naturally looked down upon by that other section of  county society which had all its clothes from London or Paris. The dressmaker  had made Hilda&rsquo;s frocks ever since she was a baby, and was inclined to be  doleful at the idea of this trousseaux-less entrance into matrimony; but on  being put upon her mettle she declared that the neat little white satin  wedding-gown and the handy little olive cloth travelling-gown should be  perfection after their kind; and then came a lengthy discussion about sleeves  and velvet waistcoat, and the all-important question of buttons was treated  exhaustively. Miss Pittman, the dressmaker, had been told of Dor&eacute; and of  Redfern, and had lain awake of a night thinking of their productions; she had  been shown dresses from Swan &amp; Edgar and from Lewis &amp; Allenby; but she  believed that for the hang of a skirt or the fit of a sleeve she could hold her  own with any house in London. And then she favoured Hilda and the Fr&auml;ulein with  a little lecture upon the righteous and the unrighteous manner of making and  putting in a sleeve, which was eminently interesting from a technical point of  view.</p>
<p>The first three days of that week seemed to Hilda  to pass like a dream. She managed to maintain an outward aspect of supreme  calmness; but her brain seemed to her in a whirl all the time. She went in and  out of the house, and wandered about the gardens without knowing why; she went  hither and thither, half her time hardly conscious where she was. She began one  thing after another, and never finished anything. She was always waiting for  Bothwell&rsquo;s letters, which came by every post, albeit a third person might have  supposed that he could find very little to write about. For Hilda the letters  were full of interest, and she made as much haste to answer them as if she and  Bothwell had been heads of parties carrying on the business of the nation at a  crisis. She was anxious to receive her brother&rsquo;s answer to her letter; but when  it came, though satisfactory upon some points, the reply was not altogether  agreeable.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mrs. Wyllard is quite justified in saying that I  left the arrangement of your wedding in her hands,&rdquo; wrote Heathcote. &ldquo;You could  have no kinder friend or wiser counsellor, and to her decision, as to the date  of your marriage, I bow. But I regret to say that I shall not be present at the  ceremony. I have business which still detains me in Paris; and I have other  reasons which hinder my being a witness of your wedding. You must not suppose  that this decision on my part arises from any unfriendly feeling to Bothwell  Grahame. I have reconciled myself to his marriage with you; and I shall do my  uttermost in the future to prove myself his friend as well as yours. He will  find that the instructions I have sent as to your settlement are framed with a  due regard to his interests.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There is one thing, however, in which I desire to  alter Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s scheme, kind and hospitable as her idea is &mdash; namely with  regard to your residence after your marriage. I cannot allow you to spend the  first few months of your married life under Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s roof, while your  brother&rsquo;s house is more than large enough to hold you and your husband. It is  my wish, therefore, that Bothwell should bring you back to The Spaniards after  your honeymoon, and that you and he should live there till your new home is  ready for you. You will, in all probability, be very little troubled with my  company, as I am likely to remain in Paris for some time to come; and you and  Bothwell can ride my hunters and consider yourselves master and mistress of  everything. I must beg that upon this question my wishes shall be regarded, and  that you will carry out my plan, even at the hazard of offending Mrs. Wyllard,  whom you know I esteem and respect above all other women.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And now, my dear girl, I have nothing to do but to  wish you all the blessings which a good and true-hearted woman deserves when  she marries the man of her choice, and to request your acceptance of the  enclosed cheque for your house and your trousseau. &mdash; Your very affectionate  brother,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;EDWARD HEATHCOTE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheque was for two hundred and fifty pounds;  but liberal as the gift was, it did not reconcile Hilda to the idea of her  brother&rsquo;s absence on her wedding-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is extremely unkind of him not to come,&rdquo; she  said, throwing the letter and enclosure into her desk. &ldquo;And it is not kind of  him to alter Dora&rsquo;s plans. I know she looked forward to having us at Penmorval.  But I shall go and see her every day, poor darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea of her brother&rsquo;s absence on her  wedding-day &mdash; that most fateful day in a woman&rsquo;s life &mdash; cast a shadow across  the sunlight of Hilda&rsquo;s bliss. She could think of nothing else after the  receipt of Heathcote&rsquo;s letter; and she was full of wonder as to his reasons for  thus absenting himself upon an occasion when duty and good feeling both  demanded his presence.</p>
<p>What could be his motive? she asked herself. He was  not the kind of man to spare himself the trouble of crossing the Channel, even  had it been necessary for him to return to Paris directly after the wedding. He  had never spared himself trouble or shirked a duty. It was clear to her,  therefore, that he had some very strong motive for absenting himself from the  marriage ceremony.</p>
<p>She could only imagine one reason for his conduct.  She told herself that her brother, in his heart of hearts, still doubted  Bothwell, and still disapproved of her marriage. He had allowed himself to be  talked over by Mrs. Wyllard. The influence of that unforgotten love had  prevailed over his own inclination. He had allowed his consent to be wrung from  him; and now that it was too late to withdraw that consent he was not the less  Bothwell&rsquo;s enemy. He could not bring himself to look on as an approving witness  at a marriage which he regretted. He had told his sister that his discoveries  in Paris had gone far to convince him of Bothwell&rsquo;s guiltlessness in relation  to the French girl&rsquo;s death: but there was still something in the background,  some prejudice yet undispelled, some doubt which darkened friendship.</p>
<p>It was the Wednesday before her wedding-day, and  her preparations and arrangements had been for the most part made. There had  been, indeed, but little to do, since her return to The Spaniards as a bride  would simplify matters, and give her ample time for packing her belongings &mdash;  namely, those books and nicknacks which had beautified her own rooms; her  jewels, chiefly an inheritance from her mother; and those few wedding presents  which had arrived from the three or four intimate friends who had heard of her  engagement. Among these gifts there was an immense satin-lined work-basket,  from Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein &mdash; a basket provided with an orderly arrangement of  tapes, buttons, cottons, and needles, such as a careful housewife must needs  require in the repair of the family linen. The Fr&auml;ulein had made a special  journey to Plymouth in order to purchase and furnish this treasury of  usefulness; and had brought it back in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot give you beautiful things,&rdquo; said the kind  creature apologetically. &ldquo;You have too many valuable jewels of your own to care  for any trinket which I could offer; but in this basket you will find all which  an industrious wife needs to preserve order and neatness in her household  goods. There is flourishing thread of every quality to darn your table linen.  There are pearl buttons of every size for your husband&rsquo;s shirts; angolas of  every shade for his socks; needles of every number; bobbins; scissors of every  kind; and lastly, for remembrance of an old friend, there is this golden  thimble, which I hope you will wear every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with this little speech the Fr&auml;ulein plumped  her basket down in front of Hilda, and burst into tears, remembering how she,  too, had once been engaged, and how adverse Fate had hindered her marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear kind soul,&rdquo; said Hilda, kissing her  affectionately; &ldquo;and I am sure you could not have given me anything I should  have liked better. I shall think of you every day when I use this delightful  basket. There is nothing like a useful gift for recalling an old friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora&rsquo;s present arrived the same day. A George II.  tea-service, with two little caddies for black tea and green tea, holding about  a quarter of a pound each. Hilda thought her silver teapot the sweetest thing  that had ever been made, and she sat gazing at the service for an hour at a  stretch, and thinking how delightful it would be to make tea for Bothwell in  the cosy winter dusk, when they two should be settled in their own house above  the great Atlantic sea, the curtains drawn across their old-fashioned lattices,  the wind raving over the hills, the waves roaring, and they two beside the  domestic hearth, wrapped in a blessed calm &mdash; two hearts united and at rest.</p>
<p>She had been so happy yesterday in the thought of  her future; and now to-day her brother&rsquo;s letter seemed to have changed the  aspect of things. She was full of a vague disquietude &mdash; could not settle to any  occupation, did not even care to take her usual walk across the hills to the  Manor to inquire about Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s health, and to spend an hour in  confidential talk with Dora. To-day she sent a messenger instead, and sat all  day in her own room brooding over Heathcote&rsquo;s letter. She felt unequal to  facing the twins or the Fr&auml;ulein, and pleaded a headache as a reason for not  going down to luncheon; and indeed her troubled thoughts about that letter from  Paris had given her a very real headache.</p>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, when she  heard a carriage drive up to the hall-door, and thought with horror that she  would be summoned to receive callers. Her window commanded only an angle of the  porch. She could just see a shabby-looking vehicle, which she knew could only  be a fly from the station; and her heart began to beat violently as she thought  that perhaps her brother had changed his mind, and had come home to do honour  to her wedding.</p>
<p>No; it was no such pleasant surprise, only a  strange lady who asked to see her. She had sent up her card:</p>
<p>&ldquo;LADY VALERIA HARBOROUGH.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lady will be greatly obliged if you will see  her,&rdquo; said the servant. &ldquo;She has come from Plymouth on purpose to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I will see her,&rdquo; answered Hilda  cheerfully. &ldquo;You have shown her into the drawing-room, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take in tea as soon as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda glanced at her glass before she left the  room. Her plain cashmere gown was neat enough, and her hair was tolerably tidy,  but her eyes had a heavy look, and she was very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t look a joyful bride, or do  Bothwell credit in any way,&rdquo; she said to herself.</p>
<p>She had heard her lover speak once or twice of  General Harborough as his kindest and most powerful friend in India. She had  heard from Dora of the General&rsquo;s death, and that Bothwell had attended the  funeral. And now she felt flattered exceedingly at the idea that the General&rsquo;s  widow had taken the trouble to come to see her; no doubt from pure friendliness  for her dead husband&rsquo;s <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</em> &mdash;  deeming that there was no better compliment she could pay Mr. Grahame than to  assume an interest in his betrothed. She, like Dora, took it for granted that  old General Harborough&rsquo;s wife would be an elderly woman; and she went down to  the drawing-room expecting to see a portly matron, gray-haired, bland, perhaps  a little patronising in her double rank of Earl&rsquo;s daughter and General&rsquo;s widow.  She was surprised beyond all measure when a tall and slender figure rose to  meet her, and she found herself face to face with a young woman whose brilliant  eyes and interesting countenance were more striking than commonplace beauty.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter23"></a>Chapter 23<br>
  Lady Valeria Fights Her Own Battle</h2>
<p>The two women stood face to face in silence for a  few moments. Surprise made Hilda dumb. She gazed in unconcealed wonderment at  the small pale face framed in white crape, the delicate high-bred features,  refined almost to attenuation, the luminous violet eyes with their long dark  lashes, eyes which alone gave life and colour to the face.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria looked at the girl with so piercing a  scrutiny that those brilliant eyes of hers seemed to burn into the face of her  rival &mdash; a scathing look, measuring and appraising that modest girlish beauty,  cheapening those innocent charms in scornful wonder.</p>
<p>And this was the woman for whose sake she, Valeria,  had been flung away like an old glove &mdash; this girl-face, with its candid blue  eyes and babified bloom, its broad white forehead ringed round with infantile  curls of golden brown, its delicately pencilled eyebrows, its coral lips, and  small white teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For people who admire babies the girl is well  enough,&rdquo; thought Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>Yet even her small knowledge of physiognomy taught  her that the broad full forehead and the firmly-moulded lips meant force of  character and firmness of purpose &mdash; that this girlish beauty was the beauty of  a good and brave woman &mdash; that here there was no reed for her to twist and rend  at her own passionate will, but a nature that was firmer and more concentrated  than her own. Equal forces had met in these two &mdash; the force of passion and the  force of principle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are Miss Heathcote,&rdquo; said the pale lips at  last, after that silent interval, in which Hilda had heard the beating of her  own heart; &ldquo;you are the Miss Heathcote who is to marry Bothwell Grahame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lady Valeria. Bothwell has told me how kind a  friend he had in General Harborough,&rdquo; returned Hilda calmly, trying to feel at  her ease under that searching gaze. &ldquo;I am very much flattered that you should  come to see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear you will feel less flattered when you know  the motive of my visit. No, thanks; I prefer to stand,&rdquo; she said curtly, as  Hilda wheeled a chair towards her guest, and courteously invited her to be  seated. &ldquo;You will hate me, no doubt, when you know why I am here; and yet I am  come to do you a service &mdash; perhaps the greatest service which one woman can  render to another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What service, Lady Valeria?&rdquo; asked Hilda, whose  girlish bloom had been momently fading, and who was now almost as pale as her  visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here to save you from a most unhappy union &mdash;  from a fatal union &mdash; from marriage with a man who loves another woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not true,&rdquo; said Hilda very calmly.  &ldquo;Whoever your informant may have been, you have been misinformed. I am as  firmly convinced of Bothwell Grahame&rsquo;s love, and of the worth of his character,  as I am of my existence. I would as soon doubt one as doubt the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are like most girls of your age reared in the  country,&rdquo; said Lady Valeria, with quiet scorn. &ldquo;You are very ignorant, and you  are very vain. I suppose you imagine that you are the first woman Bothwell  Grahame ever loved &mdash; that at seven-and-twenty he brings you a heart hitherto  untouched by beauty; that his senses only awake from a life-long torpor at  sight of your exquisite charms; that nothing less than your exceptional  loveliness could kindle that cold nature into flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Valeria, if you came here only to insult me&mdash;&rdquo;  began Hilda, moving towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here to read you a lesson, to save you from  a life of misery if I can; and you shall hear me,&rdquo; said Valeria passionately.  &ldquo;I am here for your sake, do you understand? &mdash; to save you and your lover from  an irreparable folly. He would sacrifice his own happiness and a brilliant  future, from a mistaken sense of honour to you. Now, I want you at least to  know what manner of sacrifice he is going to make for you; and if you are not  made of wood &mdash; if you have a woman&rsquo;s heart in your bosom &mdash; you will release  him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Release him! What do you mean, Lady Valeria? This  is sheer madness. Mr. Grahame sought me of his own accord &mdash; chose me  deliberately for his wife, in the face of great difficulties. We are both  completely happy in our love for each other &mdash; our faith in each other. There  never was a fairer prospect of a happy domestic life than that which smiles  upon us. There is not a cloud, or the shadow of a cloud, between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A footman brought in a little bamboo table, and  arranged the old-fashioned silver tea-tray; and during this brief interruption  hostilities were suspended, and both women composed their faces to placid  neutrality. Lady Valeria declined Hilda&rsquo;s cup of tea, proffered with a  tremulous hand; and directly the man had gone, she coldly pursued her  interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer me one question, Miss Heathcote. Do you  believe yourself Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s first love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; faltered Hilda. &ldquo;I know that there was some  one else &mdash; that there was an entanglement from which Mr. Grahame released  himself, honourably and completely, before I accepted him as my future husband.  I made that condition when first he asked me to be his wife. I waited until he  could give me his assurance upon this point before I consented to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, then you did know that there was some one?&rdquo;  exclaimed Lady Valeria, with crushing scorn. &ldquo;You did know that there was an  entanglement &mdash; or, in plain words, you knew that you were stealing another  woman&rsquo;s lover.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Valeria, you have no right to say such a  thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have every right. Yes, you knew well enough what  you were doing, in spite of your provincial bringing up. Every woman is wise in  these matters. An entanglement, you say. Do you know, girl, that this  entanglement, of which you speak so flippantly, was a passionate all-absorbing  love &mdash; a love that had lasted three years, that had braved all consequences,  that had laughed at danger &mdash; a love that burns in every line of these letters?  Read them; read them, girl, and see what your &lsquo;entanglement&rsquo; means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had opened her reticule, and had taken out a  packet of letters while she was speaking. She flung the packet on to a table  near Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read them, Miss Heathcote. I suppose you know Mr.  Grahame&rsquo;s handwriting. I suppose he has written to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see that they are in Bothwell&rsquo;s hand,&rdquo; said  Hilda, looking down at the bundle of letters, as if they had been a nest of  scorpions; &ldquo;but I decline to read letters that are not addressed to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are afraid to read them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take it upon trust that they are  love-letters. May I ask if they were written to you &mdash; General Harborough&rsquo;s  wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The calm and measured accents, the steady gaze of  those honest eyes, the resolute attitude, the small well-balanced head proudly  erect, the nervous hands clasped firmly on the back of a chair by which the  girl was standing, surprised Lady Valeria, and with a far from pleasant  surprise. She had expected Hilda to be more easily crushed. She had expected to  see a love-sick girl sobbing at her feet, ready to surrender her sweetheart at  the first attack. And instead of girlish weakness, she found a woman prepared  to do battle for her love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The letters are addressed to me. I should much  like you to read them, in order that you may understand the nature of Bothwell  Grahame&rsquo;s &lsquo;entanglement&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decline to read them. It is quite enough for me  to know that he was in love with a married woman, and that she encouraged his  love &mdash; she, the wife of a good and brave old man &mdash; she who, by the right of her  noble birth, should have been prouder, truer, purer than women of meaner race.  She stooped so low! I am sorry that you came here, Lady Valeria. I am sorry  that we have ever met &mdash; very sorry that you have told me your secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is everybody&rsquo;s secret by this time. A woman in  my position is surrounded by lynx-eyed friends, who read her inmost thoughts.  Everybody knows that Bothwell Grahame loved me, and that I returned his love.  To you this seems terrible, no doubt. Yet I can tell you that I was a true wife  to my husband, as the world estimates truth, and that he died honouring me.  You, with your provincial inexperience and your narrow mind, cannot imagine a  love which, although unconquered, could remain pure &mdash; passionate, intense,  devoted, but unstained by sin. Such a love I cherished for Bothwell Grahame,  and he for me. We had promised each other that, whenever my release came &mdash; and  in the course of nature it was not likely to be long deferred &mdash; our lives  should be linked, our love should be blest. I lived on that hope, and to  Bothwell, as those letters would tell you, that hope was no less dear than to  me. Honour, right feeling, honesty, were all involved in the promise which  bound Bothwell Grahame to me; and I never for an instant doubted that he would  keep that promise, never doubted that he was mine till death. But in an evil  hour he met you. He was under a cloud. He was maddened by the idea that his  neighbours thought the most horrible things of him. You interposed with your  girlish sympathy, your sentimental prettiness. You consoled, you encouraged him  in his dark hour; and that impulsive nature was moved to a step which he has  repented ever since. He committed himself by an avowal which left him no  possibility of retreat; and to be true to you he has broken the most sacred  promise that man ever made to woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You released him from that promise, Lady Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. Some hasty words passed between us on one  occasion, and we parted in anger. But there was no question of a release from  his solemn engagement to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me that the lady he had once loved had  released him,&rdquo; said Hilda, terribly crestfallen.</p>
<p>She could not believe that Lady Valeria Harborough  would tell her a deliberate lie. She was convinced, in spite of herself.  Bothwell had deceived her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you to read those letters,&rdquo; urged Valeria.  &ldquo;If you do not read them, you may think just a little worse of me than I  deserve. I do not pretend to be a good woman; but I want you to know that my  attachment to Bothwell Grahame never degenerated into a low intrigue. You may  hear the vilest things said of me, perhaps, by and by, when it is known that  Mr. Grahame is not going to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda looked at the letters. She knew that the  reading of them would wring her heart; and yet the temptation was too strong to  be steadfastly resisted.</p>
<p>Slowly, reluctantly, almost as if under the influence  of a mesmerist, Hilda&rsquo;s hand was extended to the packet of letters. She took it  up, and looked at it for a few moments, still hesitating.</p>
<p>The letters were folded lengthwise, without their  envelopes. Bothwell&rsquo;s bold large hand was easy enough to read, even at a  glance. Without untying the packet Hilda could see the nature of those letters.  &ldquo;My dearest love,&rdquo; &ldquo;My life,&rdquo; &ldquo;My ever beloved.&rdquo; Such words as those scattered  on the folded pages told the character of the correspondence.</p>
<p>She had known from the first, from his own lips,  that he had cared for another woman, that he had been in some manner bound to  that other woman &mdash; his future life so compromised that he must needs win his  release from that tie before he could offer himself honourably to his new love.  She had known this, and yet the sight of those impassioned phrases in the hand  of her betrothed tortured her almost to madness. She flung the packet from her,  flung it at her rival&rsquo;s feet, as if it had been some loathsome reptile that had  fastened on her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is shameful, abominable!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Such  words as those written to another man&rsquo;s wife! I will read no more &mdash; not a line  &mdash; not a syllable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you shall read, or you shall hear,&rdquo; said  Valeria, taking up the packet. &ldquo;You shall know what kind of vows this man made  to me, this man whom you are going to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drew out a letter haphazard, and thrust it into  Hilda&rsquo;s hand &mdash; forced her to read by sheer strength of will, watching her with  flashing eyes all the while.</p>
<p>Hilda read words of such passionate vehemence that  it was difficult to believe that transient feelings could have inspired them &mdash;  words which told of rapturous delight in a reciprocal love, and fondest hope of  future union; words that made light of all things in earth and heaven as  weighed against that all-absorbing love. She read of that scheme of the future  in which the ultimate marriage of the lovers was counted on as a certainty.</p>
<p>And it was for her sake he had abandoned this old  dream &mdash; this plan of a life so long cherished. It was for her, an obscure,  country-bred girl, who could bring him neither fame nor fortune, that he had  surrendered all hope of calling this brilliant high-born woman his wife.</p>
<p>And now the hour had come when he might have  claimed her, when, his years of servitude being over, he had but to wait the  brief span society demands, before he faced the world with this woman by his  side, the sharer of her social status, her ample means. Surely this would have  been a happy fate for him, if there were any truth in these words of his, words  which seemed to scorch Hilda&rsquo;s brain as she stood, silent, motionless, poring  over them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Lady Valeria, after a long silence,  &ldquo;that once at least your lover loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that once in such things meant for  ever,&rdquo; answered Hilda, with a quiet sadness, as of one who speaks of the dead.  &ldquo;Yet the man who wrote this letter has talked and written of his love for me as  tenderly, if not as passionately, as he has written here. Yes, I knew that he  had cared for some one else, but not like this. I did not think such a love as  this could come twice in a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wiser than I expected to find you,&rdquo; said  Valeria, with languid insolence. &ldquo;No, child, men do not love like that twice in  a lifetime. I had Bothwell Grahame&rsquo;s heart at its best &mdash; his constancy, his  devotion &mdash; and he would have been true to me till the end of his life had it  not been for that business of the murder, which made men look askance at him,  and your childish pity, which touched his heart when it was sorest. He was  caught in the toils of his own affectionate nature. His grateful heart, which  always melted at the least kindness, betrayed him. And because he was  sympathetic and grateful you thought he loved you; and now you stand between  him and his first love. You are the only barrier to a marriage which would make  Bothwell Grahame a rich man, and me the happiest of women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had heard him talk of our future, if you  had seen him planning our home, you would hardly doubt that he meant to be  happy with me, Lady Valeria,&rdquo; said Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, I have seen your future home; I have  heard what kind of a life Bothwell Grahame is to lead as your husband. He is to  be a schoolmaster, cramming dull boys for impossible examinations; grinding  mathematics and theoretical engineering all day long and every day, till his  brain is weary; going over the same ground again and again like a horse in a  mill. He is to be a nobody, a plodding bread-winner, living year after year in  a God-forsaken village, far away from the great arena of life; ground down by  the fathers and patronised by the mothers of his pupils. He is to cherish no  higher ambition than to be able to pay the butcher and the baker, and to get  himself a new coat before the old one is threadbare. <em>That</em> is the life to which your generous love would condemn him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not going to be quite such paupers as you  imagine, Lady Valeria. I have a small income of my own, which will at least pay  the baker; and I do not think Bothwell&rsquo;s rich cousin would see him in want of a  coat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Heathcote, it is only a question of  degree. Granted that Mr. Grahame is sure of his breakfast and dinner, his  existence as a private tutor will be none the less a life of exile from all  that makes life worth living &mdash; from the world of art and letters, from the  strife and the glory of politics, from the great world of distinguished men and  women. As my husband he would have the ball at his feet. His fortune would be  large enough to command an opening in any career he might choose for himself,  his connections on my side of the house would be powerful enough to help him,  and his talents would undoubtedly bring him to the front. In the House his  career would be assured. With his knowledge of India and Indian war tactics, he  would inevitably make his mark. There are hardly three men in the House of  Commons who have any real knowledge of that vast Eastern world for which  English politicians legislate. You see I have dreamed for him, thought for him.  All my ambition is for him, and not for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing to believe that you love him, Lady  Valeria,&rdquo; said Hilda, with frigid distinctness, looking her rival full in the  face, &ldquo;since nothing but the blindest love could induce any woman in your  position to lower yourself as you have done &mdash; first in India as General  Harborough&rsquo;s wife, and secondly to-day as General Harborough&rsquo;s widow &mdash; when you  come to me and ask me to give up my betrothed husband, the man to whom I am to  be married next Tuesday; for I suppose that is the gist of all you have said to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask nothing from you, Miss Heathcote. I know the  narrow view which most girls of your age, brought up as you have been, take of  life and its obligations. I do not expect large-minded ideas from a young lady  with your surroundings.&rdquo; This was said with infinite scorn of Hilda&rsquo;s rustic  rearing. &ldquo;But I think it well that you should know how much Bothwell Grahame  surrenders for the privilege of having you for a wife. Of course it is quite  possible that the recompense may be worth the sacrifice. It is for you to judge  of that. I wish you good-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda bowed and rang the bell, without a word. She  did not accompany her visitor to the drawing-room door, but stood in a stony  silence looking out at the window in front of her, with fixed eyes.</p>
<p>It was only when the outer door had closed on Lady  Valeria that the girl flung herself on the nearest sofa and abandoned herself  to her grief.</p>
<p>Alas, this entanglement of the past had been  something more than a garland of roses. It had been a chain from which her  lover had tried to release himself, but whose iron links yet hung about him.</p>
<p>All the happiness was gone out of her life, all the  sweet tranquillity which had been the holiest charm in her love for Bothwell,  the deep faith in her beloved, the assurance of his trustworthiness, his  unalloyed love for her. How could she ever again believe in that love, after  she had heard the history of his passion for another, after she had read of  that wild infatuation in his own hand, after she had seen the woman he had thus  loved and thus addressed &mdash; a woman to win and hold the love of men, a woman  whose face had that subtle charm of supreme refinement and distinction which is  far above the peach-bloom tints and perfect lines of stereotyped beauty? In  Valeria the broken-hearted girl acknowledged a siren before whose fascinations  the wisest man might be as a fool. She compared herself with her rival. She  walked across the room and stood before the long console-glass, contemplating  her own image, half-scornfully, half-sorrowfully. The pale tear-blotted face  appeared at its worst, robbed of the freshness that constituted half its  beauty. The slight and girlish figure looked insignificant as compared with  Valeria&rsquo;s statelier bearing.</p>
<p>The girl turned herself about, and looked at  herself at every angle, as if she had been trying on a gown at her milliner&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dowdy I am!&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;Just the  very pattern for a schoolmaster&rsquo;s wife. I doubt if Lady Valeria is more than an  inch taller; and yet she looks a queen. It is the way she carries her head, I  suppose, and the way she walks, like a woman accustomed to command. Yes, a man  might well be proud of such a wife, and of the position such a wife could give  him. Bothwell in Parliament. Bothwell a great authority on Indian affairs. How  strange it sounds! But I know how clever he is, how well he can talk upon any  subject. It would be a splendid career for him. And for my sake he is to forego  all that, and to drudge as a tutor in a Cornish village. Yes, I suppose it  would be a dreary life for such a man &mdash; though it seemed so full of brightness  when we two talked about it last week. For my sake. No, Bothwell,&rdquo; she said to  herself resolutely, striking her clenched hand upon the marble table. &ldquo;No,  Bothwell, not for my sake! You shall not surrender fame and fortune for my  sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, seating herself on the old-fashioned  window-seat, with clasped hands lying in her lap, and steadfast eyes brooding  on the ground; in an attitude of deepest thought, she retraced the history of Bothwell&rsquo;s  courtship. She asked herself if she had verily been, as Lady Valeria had  insinuated, herself half the wooer. She remembered how, in the beginning of  their acquaintance, she had admired Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s cousin &mdash; how his riding, his  singing, his conversation had alike seemed perfection. How she had contrasted  him, to his wondrous advantage, with the country squires around and about. It  was just possible that in her girlish inexperience she had betrayed her  admiration, had flattered Bothwell into the idea that he liked her. And then,  when the hour of trouble came, it was true that she had made no effort to hide  her feelings; she had given Bothwell her sympathy almost unasked; she had,  perhaps, lured him into declaring himself as her lover, when the feeling which  inspired him was but the impulse of the moment, a transient emotion, born of  gratitude.</p>
<p>She could understand how, in his self-contempt, his  wounded honour, he had believed that his love for Valeria was a thing of the  past, and had been glad to release himself from the ignoble bondage. But now  that Valeria was free, his first love, fondly attached to him, valuing her  fortune and position only as a means for his advancement, who could doubt that  the old love would revive in his breast with all the old fervour; that his  heart would go back to his first beloved, as a bird returns to its nest?</p>
<p>And was his whole life to be sacrificed because of  this one mistaken impulse? No, the wrong was not yet irreparable. The marriage  planned for next Tuesday need never take place.</p>
<p>Hilda began deliberately to scheme out the manner  in which she should set her lover free. If the thing was to be done, it must be  done bravely and thoroughly &mdash; not by halves. There must be no half-hearted  action, no wavering, no pretence of surrender offered in the hope that Bothwell  would refuse to accept his liberty. No; she must make the sacrifice as full and  as effectual as that of Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter. She gave her life to save her  father&rsquo;s honour. She (Hilda) could give her happiness, her fair future, the  sweet ideal she had dreamed of, the life which to every good woman seems of all  lives most perfect, an existence spent in tranquil seclusion with the husband  of her choice.</p>
<p>After long brooding, deepest thought interrupted  ever and anon by a burst of passionate weeping, tears which would not be  restrained, Hilda had made her plan. She would go away, quite away, where  Bothwell could not follow her. She would write him a letter which would leave  him free to return to his old allegiance, while she herself would disappear,  drop quietly out of the circle in which she was known, and remain hidden from  all her friends for the next few months, perhaps for a year: at any rate until  the joy-bells had rung for Bothwell&rsquo;s marriage with his old love. Alas, those  joy-bells! She had imagined them ringing for her own wedding; she had heard  their sweet music in her dreams.</p>
<p>Where should she go? What should she do with  herself during the time of hiding? That was the question; and it was a  difficult one for this inexperienced girl to answer. She had travelled so  little, that all the wide world outside her own home was no more familiar to  her than a chapter of geography. She knew the names of mountains and rivers,  she had made her dream-pictures of beautiful places and scenes in far-away  lands; but of railways and steamers, of the mode and manner of journeying from  one place to another, of hotels and custom-houses, and the exchange of money,  she knew hardly anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go very far away, to some place where he  would not think of following me, where he could never find me,&rdquo; she said to  herself, supposing that it would be a point of honour with Bothwell to follow  her, to keep his plighted troth, if it were possible.</p>
<p>She wanted to set him free, to make it easy for him  to go back to his old love. She told herself that Lady Valeria had spoken the  truth, and that it was not possible for him to have forgotten that old love.</p>
<p>When he had married Valeria, she, Hilda, would be  free to come back to her home, to take up the thread of her broken life and  follow it on to the dreary end. What joy could she have in her life, having  lost him? Only the joy of knowing that she had loved him better than herself,  cared more for his happiness than her own &mdash; the joy of woman&rsquo;s martyrdom.</p>
<p>After long deliberation, after having thought of a  trip to Canada or a voyage to Australia, after having meditated upon various  possible and impossible journeys, she decided upon a very commonplace course of  proceeding. She had often heard it remarked of a levanting criminal that if he  had stayed in London or any populous city, he would in all probability have  escaped his pursuers; he would have been lost in the press of humanity, like a  bubble in a running stream; whereas the man who goes to America is almost  inevitably traced and trapped.</p>
<p>She would not go to London, a city she hated, and  where she might at any moment run against her Cornish friends, all of whom paid  occasional visits to the metropolis. She would go to Paris, where she would be  lost among strangers; where she could live quietly in some obscure quarter,  improving herself as a singer and a pianiste, until her time of probation was  over, and the announcement of Bothwell&rsquo;s marriage told her that her sacrifice  had been consummated. She would so plan her life that her brother could know  that she was well and well cared for; but even he should not know the place of  her residence, lest he should betray her secret to Bothwell.</p>
<p>This idea of Paris was partly traceable to an old  influence. Until a year ago she had taken lessons from a bright little  Frenchwoman who had taught her music and singing, and who had helped her  incidentally with her French. The lessons had been going on for three years,  when Hilda was pronounced to have finished her musical education, or at least  to have learnt as much as Mademoiselle Duprez could teach her, and in those  three years the little Frenchwoman had been a weekly visitor at The Spaniards,  coming all the way from Plymouth to give her lesson, and being driven back to the  station by her pupil, after a cheery luncheon, which the little woman  thoroughly enjoyed.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Duprez claimed kindred with the famous  French tenor of that name, and had herself been a small celebrity in her way.  She had sung at the Opera House in the Rue Lepelletier, in the days when Falcon  was Diva, and Halevy&rsquo;s Juive was the success of the hour. Then came a fatal  fever, caught at Nice, where she had gone to fulfil an autumnal engagement.  Louise Duprez lost the voice which had been her only fortune. Happily, though  the voice was gone, the exquisite method learned from Garcia, and ripened at  the feet of Rossini, still remained; and by her excellence as a teacher of  singing and piano, Mademoiselle Duprez had contrived to make a comfortable  living, first in Paris, and afterwards at Plymouth, whither she had come at the  suggestion of Edward Heathcote, who had made her acquaintance at the house of  one of his Parisian friends, and who had recommended her to try a residence in  Devonshire as a cure for her delicate chest, promising at the same time to do  all in his power to help her in finding pupils at Plymouth, where he was at  that time Town Clerk.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Duprez had followed Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s  advice, and had not waited long before she found herself fairly established in  the Devonshire sea-port. Hilda had been her first pupil, and Hilda she loved  almost as a maiden aunt loves the prettiest and most amiable of her nieces. It  was Hilda she quoted to all her other pupils. &ldquo;You should hear a dear young friend  of mine, Miss Heathcote of Bodmin, sing that song,&rdquo; she would say; and an  eloquent shrug of her shoulders and elevation of her eyebrows would express how  wide the difference between Miss Heathcote&rsquo;s perfection and the shortcoming of  the performer then in hand.</p>
<p>Hilda was very fond of the lively little  Parisienne: loved to hear her talk, and to learn of her; hung upon her words as  she expounded the delicacies of her native language. Hilda had petted and made  much of the little woman whenever she came to The Spaniards; had never spent a  day in Plymouth without paying her old mistress a visit. And now in her sorrow  and difficulty it was of Louise Duprez she thought, as the one friend whom she  could trust with her secret, and who would be able to help her.</p>
<p>Hilda went to her own room before Fr&auml;ulein  Meyerstein returned from her afternoon walk with the twins. Those  well-brought-up infants were ruthlessly sent from their playroom, their  rocking-horse, and their doll&rsquo;s house, an hour after their early dinner, and were  taken for afternoon drill by the Fr&auml;ulein. Needless to say that they detested  the formal trudge along dusty lanes, and abhorred the beauties of Nature  encountered on the way; but their health no doubt profited by this severe  regimen.</p>
<p>Hilda shut herself in her own rooms for the rest of  the evening; with the usual plea of a headache. But she was up before daybreak  next morning, and by six o&rsquo;clock she had packed a small portmanteau and a  Gladstone bag with her own hands, and carried them down surreptitiously to the  stable-yard, where she gave them to an underling, with directions to put them  in the pony-cart, and take them to Bodmin Road station in time for the  eight-o&rsquo;clock train. She herself intended to walk to the station, as her  appearance on foot would be less likely to attract attention than in the  pony-cart with the luggage.</p>
<p>So in the dewy morning, alone and unattended, with  ashen cheeks and eyelids swollen by long weeping, Hilda Heathcote crept out of  her brother&rsquo;s house, and walked across the hills, trusting to the keen breath  of the autumn wind to obliterate the traces of a night of anguish before she  arrived at the station.</p>
<p>She had written a long letter to Bothwell. This she  carried with her, to post in Plymouth; and she had left letters for her brother  and for the Fr&auml;ulein. No one need be made uneasy at her disappearance.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter24"></a>Chapter 24<br>
  An Elopement On New Lines</h2>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez occupied a first floor in an airy  terrace of houses overlooking the Hoe. She was the kind of little woman to whom  eating and drinking and fine dress are matters of very small moment, but who  could not have endured to live in a shabby house or an ugly neighbourhood. All  her surroundings were neat and bright and fair to look upon. She had brought  over her furniture from Paris. It was the remnant of that furniture which had  adorned her great-grandmother&rsquo;s house at Versailles, before the fiery spirits  of the <em>tiers &eacute;tat</em> met in the  tennis-court, and the Revolution began. There was not much of it left, but that  little was of the best period in French cabinet-work, and in the most perfect  taste.</p>
<p>Louise Duprez loved this heritage from her  ancestors as if the chairs and sofa, cabinet and writing-table, had been living  things. She used to sit and contemplate them sometimes, between the lights, in  a dreamy mood, and think how much they might have told her about Marie  Antoinette and her court, and the old days of the Oeil de Boeuf, if they could  but have found a voice. The <em>bonheur du  jour</em>, with its ormolu mounts, looked very human as the firelight shone upon  it. The goats&rsquo; heads seemed to wink and twinkle like human eyes, while the  floral mouldings assumed the form of a broad human grin, as who should say,  &ldquo;Ah, I could tell you some fine farces about those ladies, if I could but  speak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle&rsquo;s rooms were always the pink of  neatness; not a book out of line on the shelves above the secr&eacute;taire, not a  scrap of work or a stray pin-cushion littering the tables; newspapers,  pamphlets, magazines, all in their places; while Mademoiselle herself was one  of those dainty little women who never have a pin awry in their toilet.</p>
<p>So when Miss Heathcote was ushered into the  singing-mistress&rsquo;s <em>salon</em> at half-past  nine in the morning, her unexpected appearance at such an early hour caused  neither confusion nor annoyance.</p>
<p>Mademoiselle had been breakfasting at a table in  front of the open window &mdash; a temperate meal of coffee and roll, neatly arranged  on a tray. Spotless damask and pretty china made the tray a picture, with  Mademoiselle&rsquo;s pink cambric gown and bright little face for background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, how early! I am enchanted to see  you!&rdquo; she cried, jumping up and kissing her old pupil on both cheeks. &ldquo;What a  good girl to come to me before my day&rsquo;s work begins! This is one of my full  days, from eleven till five. Squall, squall, thump, thump, every kind of  outrage upon the genius of harmony must these poor ears of mine suffer; and I  must be very polite, all the same; must not lose patience and cry aloud &mdash; ah,  how I long to do it sometimes!&mdash; &lsquo;My love, you have no more voice than a  peacock, no more ear than a four-post bedstead; your accent is diabolical, and  you are the very embodiment of idiotcy.&rsquo; You see one must not be quite frank  with one&rsquo;s pupils. But, Hilda, my pet, what is the matter? You have been crying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since last night, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; answered  Hilda, looking at her friend with hard, dry eyes; &ldquo;I cried so much last night  that I don&rsquo;t think I shall ever shed a tear again. There must be an end, you  know, even to tears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sweetest child, what in Heaven&rsquo;s name has  happened? Your brother, Mr. Effecotte!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Louise Duprez gasped as she spoke the name. Edward  Heathcote was her benefactor, that one Englishman whom she admired and honoured  with all her heart and mind, whom she thought almost equal to the typical  Frenchman, the French gentleman of a <em>r&eacute;gime</em> that is almost forgotten, of a day that is dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother is quite well, at least as far as I  know,&rdquo; answered Hilda, with sisterly indifference; and then she made Mdlle.  Duprez sit down, and knelt at her feet, clasping her hands, and looking up at  her earnestly. &ldquo;My dear, kind friend, I want you to help me in a crisis of my  life,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To help you to run away with Mr. Grahame, I  suppose. No, no, Hilda, <em>pas si b&ecirc;te</em>;  I am your brother&rsquo;s friend above all things. If Mr. Effecotte disapproves of  your marriage, I will do nothing to further it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t be in such a hurry,&rdquo; said Hilda. &ldquo;Hear  my trouble first, and then help me to lighten it, if you can. I think you ought  to know that I am not the kind of girl to make a runaway marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I know nothing of the kind about any  English girl. Runaway marriages seem as common in this country as runaway  knocks at my door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Englishwomen run away before marriage, and  Frenchwomen after,&rdquo; retorted Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your English matrons such  irreproachable creatures,&rdquo; said the Parisienne. &ldquo;There is your Lady Valeria  Harborough, for instance, who had one of the best husbands in Christendom, and  yet was always surrounded by a bevy of admirers, and made herself more talked  about than any woman in Plymouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she really talked about?&rdquo; asked Hilda eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really, really. I don&rsquo;t mean to say that she was  supposed to be actually incorrect in her conduct; but she brought her Indian  manners back to England with her, and she had always her court of fools and  fops about her. And now the papers are beginning to be impertinent about her &mdash;  or, at least, this stupid little paper, which models itself on some of the  London society papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez pointed to a periodical on the table  at her side &mdash; a sheet of eight pages, printed on pink paper, and calling itself  the <em>Plymouth Censor</em>. Hilda snatched  it up, and ran her eye rapidly along the paragraphs, till she came to one  worded thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rumours are already afloat in privileged circles  as to the probabilities of a second hymen for the beautiful widow of a general  officer, lately gone over to the majority. Foremost in the betting stands a  certain <em>ci-devant</em> captain of  Engineers, who saved the General&rsquo;s life by a dexterous shot in the jungle, and  who has been <em>du dernier bien</em> with the  General&rsquo;s charming wife ever since. Ours is an age of rehabilitations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Valeria was right,&rdquo; murmured Hilda. &ldquo;People  know all about her folly. Her only redemption will be her marriage with  Bothwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she opened her heart to her old friend &mdash;  told her everything that had passed between herself and Lady Valeria &mdash; told her  how she had made up her mind to sacrifice her own happiness rather than to let  Bothwell&rsquo;s life be spoiled by a mistaken engagement. At first Mdlle. Duprez  ridiculed her plan as Quixotic to absurdity, and refused to have anything to do  with it. But the girl&rsquo;s indomitable resolution, her intense earnestness of  purpose, prevailed at last over the Frenchwoman&rsquo;s scruples. Louise Duprez, at  four-and-forty years of age, was as romantic as the simplest schoolgirl. She  had spent the last fifteen years of her life almost entirely among girls. She  had been the confidante of their love-affairs, their fond dreams of the ideal; she  had counselled and lectured them, had sympathised and sorrowed and joyed with  them. And now she was quite ready to be impressed by the heroic element in  Hilda&rsquo;s intended sacrifice. The happiness of one young life given away to  secure the fame and fortune of another and dearer life. It was a romantic  scheme which kindled all Louise Duprez&rsquo;s warmest fancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I were young again, to do such a thing  myself for my beloved!&rdquo; she thought to herself, with a tender sigh for her only  lover, who had perished, a burly major of Artillery, on the bloody field of  Sedan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I ever answer to your brother &mdash; my best  of friends &mdash; if I assist you in rebellion against him?&rdquo; asked Mdlle. Duprez,  after a thoughtful silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not rebelling against my brother. I am only  leaving my home in order to break an engagement which Edward always  disapproved. He gave his consent reluctantly at the last, to please Mrs.  Wyllard. He will be very glad to hear that the engagement is cancelled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have no right to conceal your whereabouts  from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The concealment need not last long &mdash; only till  Bothwell has gone back to his old love; and that I should think will be very  soon,&rdquo; with a stifled sob. &ldquo;There is no use in your being unkind to me. If I do  not find a home in France with your aid, I shall find it without you. I have  made up my mind to go on to Southampton by the midday train, and to cross to  Havre to-night. The steamer leaves Southampton at ten o&rsquo;clock. There will be  plenty of time for me to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are going alone, without even a maid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot possibly live alone among strangers &mdash;  it is out of the question,&rdquo; protested Mademoiselle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is why I ask you to give me an introduction  to some friends of yours in a quiet part of Paris, who will take me into their  family circle, and help me to carry on my musical education at the  Conservatoire. The Conservatoire has been the dream of my life. You must know  of such people, with your numerous acquaintance among the musical profession&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, no doubt I know of such people. But how am I  to reconcile the idea of giving you such an introduction with my duty to your  brother?&rdquo; argued Mdlle. Duprez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your duty to my brother &mdash; if there is any such  thing &mdash; is to find me a respectable home in Paris,&rdquo; said Hilda. &ldquo;I tell you  once for all that I have made up my mind to start for Paris to-night &mdash; to live  there in some quiet quarter for the next year or so. I shall go forth in the  strength of my own ignorance and courage, like Miss Bird in her journey across  the mountains, if you don&rsquo;t help me. Perhaps I may fall among thieves: and  mind, if I do, it will be your fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with extraordinary resolution, with an  animated air which seemed hardly compatible with grief. Yet this spurious  gaiety of hers was the worst symptom of all, and was very close to hysteria.</p>
<p>Louise Duprez could read the meaning that underlay  that false air of good spirits. She saw that the girl was nearly heart-broken,  and that this resolution of hers which she had taken up so heroically was  perhaps the very best possible issue out of her sorrow: for Louise accepted  Hilda&rsquo;s own view of the case, and took it for granted that Bothwell was willing  to go back to his old love. With her experience as a woman of the world, having  seen how selfishness and self-love are the motive-powers that propel the  machine called society, Mdlle. Duprez was ready to believe that General  Harborough&rsquo;s death, and Lady Valeria&rsquo;s position as a rich widow, would entirely  alter Bothwell&rsquo;s views.</p>
<p>It was very hard for Hilda: but still human nature  is human nature, and a young man with his way to carve in the world would  hardly regret such an opportunity as a marriage with Lady Valeria Harborough.</p>
<p>Had Hilda allowed matters to take their course, the  poor young man would no doubt have gone quietly to his fate; he would have  marched heroically up to the altar; he would have settled down with his young  wife in the village home he had planned for himself; he would have drudged as a  teacher of stupid lads; and he would have repented ever afterwards. What  happiness could possibly come to Hilda in a life spent with a disappointed man,  who would remember, every day of his toilsome existence, that he had missed  fame and fortune for his wife&rsquo;s sake?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That a man should be fond of teaching for its own  sake &mdash; <em>ce n&rsquo;est pas Dieu possible!</em>&rdquo;  exclaimed Mdlle. Duprez, with a shuddering reminiscence of her own sufferings.</p>
<p>So, having reasoned thus, she made up her mind to  help Hilda to carry out her act of self-abnegation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did not believe that you are acting for your  own ultimate happiness, I would not aid you in this matter by one jot or one  tittle,&rdquo; said the little woman, in her own energetic way; &ldquo;but, as it is, I am  going to put on my bonnet and take you to Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was said in so quiet a manner that Hilda  thought her friend was joking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to go with me?&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to let your brother&rsquo;s sister travel  alone, arrive alone, and a stranger, in such a city as Paris. There is no Rue  des F&egrave;ves now, with its famous Lapin Blanc, where Eug&egrave;ne Sue&rsquo;s thieves used to  keep their rendezvous; but for all that has been done, Paris is Paris &mdash; and if  you have set your mind upon going there, I must go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dear Mademoiselle, think of the trouble, the  fatigue &mdash; and your lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My lessons must stand over till my return. I shall  be back next Monday. Don&rsquo;t say another word, Hilda. There&rsquo;s no time to be  wasted in talk. You are going to eat your breakfast. I&rsquo;ll wager you left home  without so much as a cup of tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was nobody up,&rdquo; faltered Hilda, who had  eaten nothing since Lady Valeria&rsquo;s visit, and who was suffering all the pangs  of exhaustion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not; and you have been walking and  travelling, and are ready to faint at this moment,&rdquo; protested Louise, ringing  as she spoke. &ldquo;You are going to have some nice hot coffee &mdash; I have taught them  to make coffee in this house, I who speak to you &mdash; and an egg, while I write to  my pupils to apologise for my sudden disappearance; and precisely at twelve  o&rsquo;clock there will be a fly at the door to take us to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a cheque to cash at the Bank,&rdquo; said Hilda.  &ldquo;Perhaps the maid could get it cashed for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how much is your cheque?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and fifty pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would let my poor little slavey  trot about Plymouth with two hundred and fifty pounds?&rdquo; cried Mdlle. &ldquo;She is as  honest as the day; but the magnitude of the sum would turn her brain. She would  walk into the harbour unawares. No, if you have such a cheque as that to cash, you  must take it to the Bank yourself; and instead of carrying all the cash with  you to Paris, you had better draw only fifty, and leave the two hundred on  deposit. You can draw more when you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slavey answered the bell, a neat little  handmaiden in pink cotton, who was told to get breakfast for Miss Heathcote,  and to order a fly to be at the door at a quarter to twelve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will allow us fifteen minutes for the Bank,&rdquo;  said Mademoiselle, opening her desk, and beginning her letters.</p>
<p>Everything was done in a brisk business-like  manner. It was only when they were in the train which was to take them by way  of Exeter to Salisbury, and then to Southampton, that Hilda had leisure to  realise the step which she had taken.</p>
<p>She had written to Bothwell in perfect frankness,  had opened her heart to him, telling him that his happiness was dearer to her  than her own, that his honour was paramount in her mind over every other  consideration. And she told him that honour should constrain him to marry the  woman who had been compromised by his love in the past, and who loved him  unselfishly and devotedly in the present, holding her own pride as nothing when  weighed against her love for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No woman could act as Lady Valeria has acted this  day to whom love was not all in all,&rdquo; she wrote, pleading her rival&rsquo;s cause,  because she thought it was the cause of right, and Bothwell&rsquo;s cause also.  &ldquo;Think how such a woman must have lowered herself in her own self-respect when  she came to me, her inferior in social station, her junior by ten years, to  make confession of her love. It was for your sake she stooped so low, Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not try &mdash; out of a mistaken sense of duty &mdash; to  follow me, or to dissuade me from a decision which is irrevocable. When you  receive this letter I shall have entered upon a new phase of life, in which it  would be almost impossible for you to find me &mdash; and if you did find me, to what  end? My mind is made up. Do not allow your kind heart to be tormented by  needless remorse. My heart is not broken, dear Bothwell; I mean to live my life  peacefully, contentedly; to cultivate new ideas of happiness, wider horizons.  You need never be troubled at the thought that this cancelled engagement of  ours has broken my life. Be sure only of one thing &mdash; that my dearest hope,  wherever I may be, will be for your welfare. To know that your life is happy  will be enough to fill my cup of joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had written from the depth of her faithful  heart, resigning him willingly, having no sense of ill-usage, no anger even  against Lady Valeria: only some touch of contempt for a woman who had been an  unworthy wife to a noble husband.</p>
<p>And now the thing was done. Her letter, posted in  Plymouth by her own hand, was on its way to Bothwell. Could she doubt, knowing  what she knew, that the letter would come upon him as a welcome release, would  relieve him from a most embarrassing position? And then she remembered that  wretched paragraph in the <em>Censor</em>; and  it seemed to her that Bothwell&rsquo;s first duty in life was to set Lady Valeria  right before the world. Even if he had ceased to love her, his duty was not the  less clear; but who could doubt that the old love still held the first place in  his heart?</p>
<p>The journey from Plymouth to Southampton seemed  woefully long that bright autumn day. The sun was almost as strong as it had  been in August, and the light glared in upon Hilda as she sat in the corner of  the carriage, very white and very silent, but perfectly calm and collected. Her  eyelids were heavy and swollen after the night of weeping, but her eyes were  tearless. Louise Duprez gave a furtive look every now and then, to see if the  girl was quietly weeping behind the newspaper which she pretended to read; but  there were no tears in the wistful eyes, so full of troubled thought.</p>
<p>Once, when they had the compartment to themselves  for a little while, between station and station, Louise put out her hand and  clasped Hilda&rsquo;s as it held the newspaper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you changed your mind?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;you have  had plenty of time for thinking in this creeping omnibus-train. Shall we take  another train at Exeter, and go back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the world,&rdquo; answered Hilda firmly. &ldquo;Do you  suppose I did not deliberate before I made up my mind last night? I was  thinking all night long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez gave a little submissive sigh. In her  own philosophic mind she was sure the girl was right; but then Mdlle. Duprez  had arrived at an age when the surrender of a lover may be borne; and she was  keen-witted enough to know that these things were different for Hilda.</p>
<p>It was only in the afternoon of the next day that  they arrived at the Saint-Lazare terminus, whence they drove at once to the  H&ocirc;tel du Bon Lafontaine, on the left side of the Seine, a house much affected  by bishops and abb&eacute;s, and having a semi-clerical and old-world air altogether  different from the smart caravanserais in Anglo-American Paris. Hilda was too  unhappy to feel any delight in the grandeur of Boulevards, churches, and  palaces, which she passed on her way from the station to the hotel. Her aching  eyes saw all things dimly, as in a dream. She had only a vague sense of wide  streets, glancing river, stupendous architecture, white in the autumn sun: and  then when the carriage had crossed the river there came narrower streets,  shabbier houses, an air of busier and more homely life.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez ordered lunch at the hotel, where she  was known and welcomed with friendliest greeting by manageress and head-waiter;  and Hilda, for the first time in her life, found herself sitting in the public  dining-room of a Parisian hotel. Happily at this hour of the day the room was  empty; and Hilda and her friend were as much alone at their little table  looking into the quaint old Parisian garden as they could have been at The  Spaniards.</p>
<p>And now Mdlle. Duprez unfolded her plans. She knew  of a family living in the Rue du Bac, an artistic family, the father and sons  painters, engravers, caricaturists; one of the daughters literary, another  musical and a pupil at the Conservatoire; the mother all that there is of the  most <em>bourgeoise</em>, but a good creature,  devoted to her children &mdash; a woman to whose care Mdlle. Duprez felt that she  could safely confide her young friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a long jaunt from the Rue du Bac to the  Conservatoire in the Rue du Faubourg Poissonni&eacute;re,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but you and  Mathilde can go there together, and it will do you good to take long walks. The  only danger is that you may run against your brother on the Boulevard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not think Edward would stay much longer  in Paris,&rdquo; said Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps while he is in Paris it would be safer for  you to go in the omnibus,&rdquo; suggested Mdlle. Duprez. &ldquo;Mr. Heathcote is not  likely to be riding in omnibuses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little woman trotted off to the Rue du Bac,  leaving Hilda to amuse herself with a flabby copy of <em>L&rsquo;Univers</em>, three days old; or to gaze despondently at the stony  quadrangle, with its bust of the good Lafontaine, and its three or four  evergreens. Seen by those melancholy eyes of hers, the garden looked like a  family vault, with the good Lafontaine for the father of the race.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez came back in less than an hour. She  had seen that dear good soul Mdme. Tillet, and had settled everything. Mdme.  Tillet would be happy to receive Miss Heathcote, and would be to her as a  mother. By putting her two daughters into one room, she could contrive to spare  a neat little sleeping apartment for the new inmate. Things were somewhat  Bohemian in the house; but what would you expect with a gifted and eccentric  family? Everything was scrupulously clean. There triumphed the household  genius, Mdme. Tillet, born in an old farmhouse in Brittany, where you might  have eaten your dinner off the red brick floor.</p>
<p>Mathilde Tillet, the musical daughter, was prepared  to welcome Miss Heathcote as a sister. There was no one in the family besides  herself who cared a straw for classical music, from Beethoven to Raff. The  brothers all believed in the <em>Madame Angot</em> school, and had no sympathy for anything loftier. Poor Mathilde had been pining  for sympathy; and to have a young companion who would toil at Bach&rsquo;s fugues and  preludes, and cram Chopin, Raff, and Brahms, and trudge to the Conservatoire  with her, would be delightful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are going to make much of you,&rdquo; said Louise  Duprez, &ldquo;I will answer for that in advance. My only fear is that the three  brothers will all fall in love with you, and then there will be storms. They  are rather fiery spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not give them any provocation,&rdquo; said  Hilda; and indeed the pale grave face, with the troubled look in the eyes, was  not suggestive of coquetry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mdme. Tillet promises to be ready to receive you  to-morrow,&rdquo; continued Mdlle. Duprez. &ldquo;I have agreed for you to pay her her own  terms, which I do not think exorbitant, considering that everything in Paris is  execrably dear. You are to pay her ten pounds a calendar month, which is to  include everything, even to your laundress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It sounds very cheap,&rdquo; said Hilda, and she would  have said the same if the sum had been twenty pounds, or even forty. She was  not in a state of mind in which to consider pounds, shillings, and pence.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez insisted upon taking her to see some  of the sights of Paris &mdash; Notre Dame, the Louvre &mdash; and then they drove to the  Conservatoire, and made inquiries as to the conditions under which Miss  Heathcote, as a stranger, might be allowed to take lessons from the professors  attached to that institution. She was to take singing lessons from Monsieur  Somebody of great renown, and music lessons from Madame Somebody of equal  renown. She was to have in all four lessons a week, on four different days; and  it seemed to Mdlle. Duprez that she would thus be too closely occupied to have  leisure for brooding on her grief. The professors of the Parisian Conservatoire  are very severe in their teaching, and a good deal of work is required of a  pupil. The pianiste must play her portion of Chopin and her tale of Bach  without book at the second time of hearing. The vocalist must give proof that  she has laboured earnestly at her <em>solfeggi</em>.</p>
<p>After the business interview at the Conservatoire,  where the name of Mdlle. Duprez was a power, the kindly little Frenchwoman  ordered the coachman to drive by the Boulevard and the Parc Monceau to the Bois  de Boulogne. She steeped her young friend in the glory and beauty of Paris,  hoping to prevent the possibility of much thought amidst so new and bright a  world. And then she proposed that they should get seats at the Com&eacute;die  Fran&ccedil;aise, where a new play of Sardou&rsquo;s was being acted.</p>
<p>Hilda roused herself from the lethargy in which she  had looked at the splendours of the Faubourg Saint-Honor&eacute;, and the brightness  of the Bois, to protest against the idea of the theatre.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to pretend to amuse myself when I  am miserable,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I mean to forget Bothwell by and by, or to think of  him only as a dear friend whose happiness makes me happy; but I cannot pretend  to have forgotten him to-day. I won&rsquo;t go to the theatre and make believe to be  amused. I should feel as if I were seeking pleasures abroad when there was some  one that I loved lying dead at home. But that need not prevent your seeing  Sardou&rsquo;s play, dear Mademoiselle. I can stay quietly at the hotel, and read  myself to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child, I don&rsquo;t care a straw for Sardou&rsquo;s play,  except as a means of making you forget your troubles. We will go and take a  quiet cup of tea with Mdme. Tillet, so that you may get reconciled to your new  surroundings. That will be much better; and then you must go to bed early and  get a good night&rsquo;s rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dined at the hotel, in the odour of sanctity,  as it were, for a bishop and a cur&eacute; were dining at the table next them, and  dining uncommonly well with a nice appreciation of the <em>plat du jour</em>, and of some excellent chambertin which appeared  towards the close of the entertainment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you won&rsquo;t be horrified when you hear that  the Tillets live over a shop,&rdquo; said Mdlle. Duprez, as she and Hilda were  walking down the Rue de Grenelle on their way to the Rue du Bac. &ldquo;It is only a  quiet little glover&rsquo;s shop, but I thought the idea might shock you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not at all shocked. I should not be, even, if  Mdme. Tillet kept the shop,&rdquo; answered Hilda, smiling her faint sweet smile,  which told of a gentle nature and a heart in pain.</p>
<p>They came to the glover&rsquo;s shop presently, a very  obscure little shop in a street where there are many big shops; shops of  renown, even, like the Petit Saint-Thomas, and the Bon March&eacute;, the Whiteley of  Paris. There was a private door beside the glover&rsquo;s. A narrow passage and a  dark staircase conducted to the abode of the Tillets, which was on the second  floor, and the approach to which echoed with sonorous laughter and manly  voices, with an admixture of girlish treble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The children are all at home,&rdquo; said Mdlle. Duprez,  who had been accustomed to hear Mdme. Tillet talk of her bearded and well-grown  brood as &ldquo;mes enfants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda found herself presently in the bosom of the  family, being embraced by Mdme. Tillet, who was a stout, comfortable-looking  matron in a gray cashmere gown and black mittens. The family sitting-room was a  spacious apartment, with piano, book-cases, easels, drawing-tables, work-tables,  all the means of various kinds of study and art; and it seemed overflowing with  human life. Half-buried in an armchair by the hearth reclined the father; the  three sons, Adolphe, Victor, and Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric, were seated at different tables,  each with his particular lamp; and the two daughters sat on each side of a  large work-basket, stitching industriously at a new gown which they were making  together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, my sweet young friend,&rdquo; said Mdme.  Tillet, and then proceeded to introduce her children.</p>
<p>Adolphe, the eldest, was distinguished for his  etchings, and rose from his delicate work upon a sheet of copper to receive the  new inmate. He was a big bearded fellow, with a mahogany complexion and  slouching shoulders, in manners and disposition as simple as a child. Victor  was a wood-engraver, who worked for Hachette on the Boulevard Saint-Germain,  hard by, and earned more money than any one else in the family. Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric was  the genius, a caricaturist. He drew for the <em>Petit  Journal</em> and the <em>Vie Parisienne</em>,  and devoted his days and nights to the concoction of <em>b&ecirc;tises</em> for those papers. Ten years ago the father had been on the  high road to fame and fortune as a painter of <em>genre</em>; but he had let other runners in the race go by him, somehow;  and now the family <em>pot-au-feu</em> was  supplied by the industry of the children, while the father dreamed his  day-dreams, and reviled his more successful contemporaries, by the domestic  hearth. The sons were great hulking, soft-hearted fellows, who adored their  mother, tolerated their father&rsquo;s idleness without a murmur, and had no fault  except that of a disposition to fall in love at the very slightest provocation.</p>
<p>Marcelline, the elder daughter, gained her share of  the family <em>p&acirc;t&eacute;e</em> by the exercise of  her pen. She wrote for two or three fashion-magazines, and was an authority  upon the ways and customs, the houses and gowns, of the great world, under  various high-sounding <em>noms de plume</em>.  She signed herself in one paper La Comtesse Boisjoli, in another La Marquise de  la Valli&egrave;re. Needless to add that she had never crossed the thresholds of those  great houses which she described so glibly. She obtained her information from  shopkeepers, her glimpses of society from the pavement on which rank and beauty  alighted for an instant in their passage from the carriage to the hall-door.  All the rest was evolved from a lively inner-consciousness.</p>
<p>Mathilde was the more serious sister, devoted to  art for art&rsquo;s sake; believing in Bach and the severe school as the highest  ideal in life, worshipping the memory of Berlioz, and despising those vanities  which occupied the thoughts of her elder sister.</p>
<p>All the family made Hilda welcome. They praised her  French, pronounced falteringly in a paroxysm of shyness. The girls took off her  hat and jacket, and installed her in a comfortable chair, while Madame bustled  about with the <em>bonne</em>, and set out a  tea-tray and a feast of sweet cakes such as Frenchwomen love. Nothing could be  more fortunate than that dear Mdlle. Duprez and her sweet young friend had  dropped in to tea this evening, protested Mdme. Tillet, for they were  momentarily expecting a visit from one of the most intellectual men in Paris,  Sigismond Trottier. &ldquo;You must have heard of M. Trottier,&rdquo; said Madame; &ldquo;his  name must be known in London as well as it is in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda blushingly admitted that she knew very little  of London, and that she had never heard of M. Trottier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really! But he must have a world-wide fame. The <em>Taon</em>, for which he writes, has made a  greater sensation than even the <em>Lanterne</em> in the days of Napoleon III. The last defeat of the Government was ascribed to  the influence of the <em>Taon</em>. The <em>Taon</em> has done more to undermine the  Conservative party than any other paper,&rdquo; said M. Tillet from the depths of his  easy-chair. &ldquo;Yet politics are not Trottier&rsquo;s chief forte. As a politician he is  trenchant and effective, but as a writer upon social topics he is really  great.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The <em>bonne</em> opened the door and announced &ldquo;M. Trottier,&rdquo; and Hilda looked anxiously at the  newcomer, finding herself for the first time in her life in the company of a  literary genius.</p>
<p>She would have liked to see the literary genius in  a cleaner shirt; but she had stories of Chatterton, of Savage, and Johnson and  Goldsmith at heart; and it seemed to her only natural that genius should be  rather dirty, and clad in a greasy olive-green coat, that genius should have  long gray hair, bushy eyebrows, and a cadaverous visage. She sat in her corner  silently, and did not expect to be noticed; but M. Tillet presented his friend  to her in a special manner, and to her surprise the olive-green genius gave a  little start at mention of her name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Effecotte!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;are all the English  people, who are not Smith or Brown, called Effecotte? Or is this young lady  related to my old friend M. Edouard Effecotte, of Cornouailles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grand Dieu,&rdquo; exclaimed Mdlle. Duprez, &ldquo;what a  small world it is we live in!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter25"></a>Chapter 25<br>
  In The Land Of Bohemia</h2>
<p>Hilda looked nervously to the right and to the  left, like some wild creature brought to bay, seeking some outlet whereby she  could escape. Those keen black eyes scrutinising her from under shaggy gray  eyebrows, that cadaverous countenance with its lantern jaws, seemed to her as  the face of a grinning fiend. This man, whom she had never seen in her life  before, had but to hear her name mentioned, and at once knew all about her.  This Paris, which she had thought of as a wilderness where she and her sorrow  might hide, was a kind of trap into which she had fallen. Above all things she  had wished to avoid any encounter with her brother, whose affection or whose  idea of brotherly duty might interfere with her scheme of self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier contemplated her curiously with  his cynical smile, amused at her embarrassment, reading whole histories in her  changing colour, her look of absolute terror. Something wrong here, he told  himself. A pretty girl, fallen among this band of Bohemians in Paris, without  the knowledge of her kindred. One of those social mysteries which Sigismond had  such a happy knack at unravelling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edward Heathcote is my brother,&rdquo; faltered Hilda,  at last, &ldquo;but he does not know that I am in Paris. I do not wish him to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider me dumb for ever upon the subject of your  residence here, Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Sigismond, with a respectful bow. &ldquo;A lady&rsquo;s  wish is a command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook hands with his old friend the painter.  They had been chums for the last twenty years; and it was to his delight in  Sigismond Trottier&rsquo;s society, among other causes, that M. Tillet owed his  decadence as an artist. It was not that he had loved art less, but he had loved  the Boulevard more. He had given up his nights to wit and pleasure; and he had  found his working days curiously shortened in consequence. He had been renowned  as one of the finest talkers, upon art, famed for his burning eloquence when he  praised the great painters of the past, and for his scathing wit when he  ridiculed the little painters of the present; for he had even thus early fallen  to that stage in the idler&rsquo;s career, when a man&rsquo;s chief consolation is to undervalue  contemporaneous merit. He had lived and enjoyed his life in those days, had  spent his money faster than he earned it, and had fallen into the ranks of  failure, to be supported by the toil of his wife and her children, to be the  family log, the family disease. They were all very patient, those children of  his. They worked for him and admired him, believed in him almost. They admired  the great genius he might have been if he had only worked. They valued him for  potentialities of greatness of which he talked sometimes, in his dreamy way; as  if those idle aspirings had been actual achievements.</p>
<p>The shabby old <em>salon</em>,  with its dark-red paper, stained and faded with age, was glorified by some of  M. Tillet&rsquo;s pictures, painted before his slothful hand had begun to lose its  cunning. There hung the portrait of a beautiful duchess, exquisitely painted &mdash;  a lovely head, an ideal neck and shoulders, in white satin and brown fur, like  an old Venetian picture. The head had been successful, but shoulders, arms, and  draperies were still unfinished. The picture had been a commission, an offering  from the Duchess to her distinguished father, a Minister of State, on his f&ecirc;te.  But the f&ecirc;te had come and gone, and the portrait was not ready. Time had been  conceded, and more time, and still the draperies remained unfinished, and still  the picture was not fit to leave the painter&rsquo;s studio. Finally the commission  had been cancelled. Some lesser genius had painted the Duchess, briskly,  punctually, readily, out of hand. These meaner souls can go in harness. And the  meaner soul received the seven thousand francs which were to have been paid to  M. Tillet, and the painter had his unfinished picture, as a kind of pendant to  his incomplete life. Happily, those trustful sons and daughters of his were  very proud of that unfinished portrait, and of the four or five sketches for <em>genre</em> pictures, never painted, which  adorned the family <em>salon</em>. There was  not another man in France who could paint like their father, they said, or who  had such talent in composition. Meissonier would have been nowhere in the race  if Eug&egrave;ne Tillet had but stuck to his easel.</p>
<p>Trottier and Tillet began to talk, and the sons  went on with their work in a free-and-easy manner, while Madame and the  daughters waited upon their guests. Poor Hilda had been so unnerved by this  unexpected encounter with a friend of her brother&rsquo;s that she could only falter  the feeblest replies to Marcelline and Mathilde, who tried to make themselves  at home with her.</p>
<p>Marcelline, who was rather strong-minded, lost  patience at last, and asked Mdlle. Duprez, in an undertone, as she handed a  plate of <em>petits fours</em>, if her young  friend was not just a trifle stupid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as clever as you and your sister, and that  is saying a good deal,&rdquo; replied Louise Duprez, in the same undertone; &ldquo;but she  has just suffered a great heart-blow, and that kind of thing is not calculated  to make one particularly lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was enough for Marcelline, who was very  tender-hearted. She went back to her seat next Hilda, and took her hand at the  first opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope we are going to be great friends,&rdquo; she  murmured, &ldquo;although you and Mathilde will have more in common. I long to hear  you sing. Mdlle. Duprez says you have such a lovely voice. But perhaps you are  too tired to sing to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will excuse me,&rdquo; faltered Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, we will excuse you. You must be very  tired, after travelling all night. And you were dreadfully sea-sick, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I escaped that suffering. I am never  sea-sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, is that possible? If I go but a  little way on the sea, the least little way, I suffer tortures, veritable  agonies. And you others, you English, do not seem to suffer at all. You are a  kind of sea-dogs, to whom waves and tempest are a natural element.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was brought up near the coast,&rdquo; answered Hilda.  &ldquo;I have been out in all weathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she thought of that wild, rock-bound coast  on which she and Bothwell were to have lived, they two, all in all to each  other, ineffably happy amidst simplest surroundings. She thought of the boat  they were to have had &mdash; the cockle-shell rowboat in which they were to have  gone dancing over the waves from Tintagel to Boscastle, or by Trebarwith sands,  shining golden in the sunlight &mdash; in a bright world of life and clamour, the bird-world  of gulls and cormorants, a winged populace, rejoicing in sea-foam, and light,  and the music of the winds. She thought of the life that was to have been &mdash; the  fairy fabric of the future, which had seemed so beautiful and so real, and  which her ruthless hand had shattered.</p>
<p>Had she done right in so surrendering that fair  future? Yes, again and again yes. The level domestic life which would have been  so sweet to her as a woman would have been stagnation, a slow decay for an  ambitious man. Her simple rustic rearing had prepared her for such a life. The  monotony of a village existence was all-sufficient for her narrower views, her  more concentrated nature. But Bothwell had seen the world, had lived in the  thick of the strife; and it was most unnatural that he should resign all  ambition, and live from day to day, working for his daily bread, like a  labourer in the fields. He was to do this for her sake, his sole reward her  love. It would have been, indeed, a one-sided bargain.</p>
<p>Hilda heard the light, airy talk around her &mdash; the  talk about art and music and theatres, about the great world and its scandals &mdash;  as in a dream. It was a world of which she knew nothing; and the conversation  around her seemed as if it had been carried on in a kind of verbal hieroglyphics.  The French she heard to-night was a new language &mdash; made up of catchwords and  slang phrases &mdash; lines from new plays, words twisted into new meanings &mdash; in a  word, the language of the Palais Royal Theatre, and the <em>Vie Parisienne</em>. Hilda listened and wondered, most of all when  Mdlle. Duprez, that most classical and academical of speakers, showed herself  perfectly at home in this little language of Bohemian Paris.</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier was a favourite in the Tillet  household. His visits were rare, and he never appeared before nine o&rsquo;clock in  the evening. He came nominally to tea, and the weak infusion of Bohea and the  dainty little dishes of sweet cakes were always set forth at his coming; but  the refreshment he most cared for was absinthe, and a small bottle of that  dangerous liqueur and a carafe of water were always placed on the little table  near the host&rsquo;s armchair, and from this bottle M. Trottier supplied himself.  That greenish hue of his complexion was the livery of the absinthe-drinker,  whose skin gradually assumes the colour of his favourite stimulant.</p>
<p>Trottier was dear to Eug&egrave;ne Tillet as a link with  that brilliant past which was now but a memory. He liked to hear the journalist  talk of the great men who had failed, and of the little men who had succeeded  in art and literature. Strange that all the great men should have gone to the  dogs, while all the little men had been pushing forward to the front.</p>
<p>It was like a game at draughts, in which the white  men seem to be winning with a rush, when somehow the black men edge in  stealthily here and there, in front, behind, at odd corners, until those  splendid white fellows are all pushed off the board. To hear Trottier and  Tillet talk, it would seem as if the chief characteristic of true genius was an  irretrievable bent towards the gutter.</p>
<p>The journalist&rsquo;s visits in the Rue du Bac were  never long. He had to leave at half-past ten, in order to write his paragraphs  for the next number of the <em>Taon</em>, to  be issued early next morning.</p>
<p>Mdlle. Duprez took leave at the same time as M.  Trottier, and the journalist offered to escort the two ladies to their hotel,  an arrangement which the Frenchwoman had foreseen. The street was very quiet at  this hour, and as the pavement was narrow Mdlle. Duprez had an excuse for  asking Hilda to walk a few yards in front, while she herself talked  confidentially with M. Trottier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You no doubt think it is very strange that my  young friend should be in Paris without her brother&rsquo;s knowledge,&rdquo; she said  tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is so full of strange events that I have long  left off wondering or speculating about anything,&rdquo; he replied easily. &ldquo;I have  no doubt Mees Effecotte is a most charming young person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I want you to know more about her than  that. I want you to understand that she is just as good as she is charming. She  is brave, unselfish, noble, capable of self-sacrifice &mdash; and there are a good  many charming girls who are none of these things. There is nothing underhand in  her presence in this city without her brother&rsquo;s knowledge. I, Louise Duprez,  give you my word for that, and ask you as a favour to respect her secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already pledged myself to do that, <em>ch&egrave;re demoiselle</em>. Indeed, I am not  likely to see much more of Mr. Effecotte. He wanted my help in a matter in  which I was at first willing to aid him, but in which I afterwards saw peril to  a man whom I had known and liked in the past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished you to know that Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s sister  is in no way unworthy of her brother&rsquo;s love and protection. She is here to  break off an engagement which would in all probability have ended unhappily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need tell me no more. Your young friend is in  very good hands. Mdme. Tillet is one of the best women I know; the true heart  of motherhood beats under that broad chest of hers. She will take good care of  your young friend in this dangerous city of Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They parted at the entrance to the Bon Lafontaine,  where Hilda and her friend had two little bedrooms adjoining each other, and  where Hilda slept a troubled sleep, wearied by the fatigue of her journey, but  haunted by sad thoughts even in the midst of her slumbers.</p>
<p>She transferred herself and her few belongings to  the Rue du Bac next morning, and then went with Mdlle. Duprez to the Bon  March&eacute;, where she bought all she wanted, including two neat little ready-made  gowns, one of gray alpaca, and the other of black cashmere, and a black velvet  toque which gave her the true Parisian air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very wise of you to bring so little  luggage. English gowns would have stamped you at once as an Englishwoman, and  would have made people stare at you. In those neat little frocks you may pass  anywhere unobserved,&rdquo; said Mademoiselle approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except for your fair young face, which is brighter  than the typical face of the Boulevard,&rdquo; thought Louise Duprez, who did not care  to praise her <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</em> too much.</p>
<p>She only stayed to see Hilda fairly installed in  her new home, and left Paris by an afternoon train which would take her to  Havre in time for the evening boat. She would be at Southampton next morning,  and at Plymouth in the afternoon. Hilda went to the railway-station with her  friend, full of gratitude for her kindness, kissing her with warmest thanks at  parting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows whether I have done right or wrong,  child, in helping you,&rdquo; said the Quixotic little woman, with a doubtful sigh.  &ldquo;I have allowed myself to be guided by the instinct of my heart, and a woman&rsquo;s  heart is not always a wise counsellor. If that young man of yours does not care  for his wealthy widow, a nice mess I have helped you to make of two lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he does care for her. He loved her devotedly  for three years. A man cannot change all at once,&rdquo; argued Hilda; &ldquo;and she is so  elegant, so aristocratic &mdash; fascinating, no doubt, when she chooses. Bothwell  could not help loving her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he ought not to have pretended to love you,&rdquo;  retorted Louise Duprez severely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was my fault,&rdquo; said Hilda, with a sigh.</p>
<p>The signal for departure sounded, and the friends  said good-bye. Mathilde had accompanied Hilda to the station, and had waited  discreetly at a little distance during those last confidences. The two girls  walked home to the Rue du Bac together, Hilda fearing lest she should run  against her brother at any moment.</p>
<p>And now Hilda&rsquo;s new life began in earnest, a life  in a strange household, amidst new surroundings. She was to try and find  consolation in hard work, in her love of music &mdash; to create for herself new  interests, if it were possible, while every moment of her life was haunted by  thoughts of the lover she had deserted, and the home that was to have been  hers.</p>
<p>She took her first lesson at the Conservatoire on  the following Monday morning, and the professor who taught her was very  encouraging about her voice and talent. He told her she possessed an organ  worthy of the highest cultivation, capable of the grandest development. He put  aside the little German song which she had taken with her, and gave her a solo  of Gl&uuml;ck&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were taught by Mdlle. Duprez, I understand,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;An admirable woman, quite an admirable manner &mdash; one of Garcia&rsquo;s best  pupils, and one of the few women capable of profiting to the uttermost by  Garcia&rsquo;s teaching. You have been taught in the best school, Mademoiselle, and  you have nothing to unlearn. That is saying a great deal. On the other hand, I  need not tell you that you have a great deal to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure of that, sir. I have come to Paris on  purpose to profit by your instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a view to appearing in opera?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; exclaimed Hilda, blushing; &ldquo;I have no such  lofty ambition. I only want to sing a little better than I do &mdash; to amuse my  brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a very limited horizon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for my own pleasure in good music.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Art for art&rsquo;s sake. There are very few  nowadays who care to work for art in the abstract. I shall be very proud of  such a pupil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda&rsquo;s fresh young face &mdash; fresh in its  youthfulness, despite the settled sadness in the eyes &mdash; her blushes and  simplicity, had fascinated the gray-headed singing-master. Louise Duprez had  hinted at Hilda&rsquo;s story &mdash; a broken engagement, a girl&rsquo;s first sorrow. He had  been told that his new pupil was an English girl of good family, brought up in  a remote province, inexperienced, pure-minded; and he who had for the last  forty years been steeped in the vanity, vices, and falsehoods of the great  garish city felt his heart drawn towards this gentle girl, with her faint  perfume of well-bred rusticity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a very fine voice, my dear child, and it  is a great pity you are not obliged to earn your own living,&rdquo; he said, smiling  at her, as he rose from the piano. &ldquo;I shall expect you to sing me that scena in  first-rate style next Wednesday.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter26"></a>Chapter 26<br>
  Reaping The Whirlwind</h2>
<p>To be on the very threshold of Paradise, within the  sound of celestial birds and the perfume of celestial flowers, to be on the  point of entering the blissful place, with heart full of hope and pride, and to  have the gates suddenly slammed in one&rsquo;s face, and to hear the voice of the  angel at the gate crying &ldquo;Ye cannot enter now,&rdquo; would be perhaps to feel as  Bothwell Grahame felt after he had read and read again that calmly worded  letter in which Hilda Heathcote renounced him and his love.</p>
<p>His senses staggered under the force of the blow.  He cursed Valeria Harborough in the rage of his tortured heart. This was her  work. This was the work of that serpent who had beguiled him to forfeit good  faith and honour in the past, and who wanted to ruin his life in the present.  Those ideas of fortune, of a lofty ambition to be realised through Valeria&rsquo;s  aid, which Hilda put forth in her letter, hardly entered into his mind; but had  Valeria been able to make him Prime Minister, or Viceroy of India, by a motion  of her hand, he would have cared for her no more than he cared for her in her  present insignificance, as a well-born widow with so many thousands a year.</p>
<p>The infatuation which had once held him was a thing  of the past, the glamour was over, the light extinguished. He looked back and  wondered that he could have ever been so enslaved, so poor a creature as to  worship a thoroughly artificial woman.</p>
<p>His first feeling about Hilda after reading her  letter was one of anger. He told himself that this renunciation had another  motive than that expressed in the letter. It was not in order to give him back  to Lady Valeria that his betrothed revoked her promise. It was in order that  she herself might escape from an engagement which for some secret reason had  become distasteful to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She draws back at the eleventh hour,&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;Perhaps even at the last she has begun to doubt me &mdash; to believe that  I may be after all the miscreant my kindly neighbours thought me, the murderer  of a helpless girl. Who knows? That idea was rooted in her brother&rsquo;s mind at  the time. It may have transferred itself to her mind when she found herself on  the eve of marriage with a suspected man. Women are given to curious fancies  and caprices; and she &mdash; she whom I thought so brave, so noble, so straight &mdash;  she too may have her crooked moments, her waverings, and unstableness, like the  rest of her sex.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He read the letter again &mdash; tried to project his  mind into the mind of the writer, to look behind the words, as it were, and by  sheer intensity of thinking to get at the hidden meaning between those lines.  No, she was not the unstable being he had been inclined to think her in his  first agony of wounded feeling. No &mdash; a thousand times no. This letter of hers  had been written in all simplicity, in all honesty. She gave him up to another,  believing that his happiness lay that way. And it was Valeria who had done this  thing &mdash; Valeria who had come between him and happiness. In his savage anger he  felt inclined to rush off to Plymouth, to lie in wait for that old idol of his  &mdash; that false goddess with feet of basest clay &mdash; to insult her before the face  of society, to put some public inextinguishable slight upon her.</p>
<p>She was a woman, exempt in her feebleness; and he  could do nothing except rage impotently at the thought of her iniquity, gnash  his teeth at that inexcusable foolishness of his past life which had made him  her slave.</p>
<p>Her slave? No, not her slave; that he would never  be. Her victim, perhaps, yes. She might blast his hopes in their fulness; she  might ruin his life; but she should never bend his neck to the yoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her money, her influence, my position as her  husband! Are those the baits with which she tempts me to her net?&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;How little she knows me! how little she knows the value of a true  woman when weighed against a false one! My true love is more to me than an  empress. Millions would not buy my allegiance to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went to the inn stables where Glencoe was at  livery, and saddled the powerful beast with his own hands, in his eagerness to  be on the way to Bodmin. Glencoe had enjoyed a day of leisure and meditation in  a very dark stable, and he left the little village of Trevena in a series of  buck-jumps, arching his vigorous back and sniffing the ground with his  quivering nostrils, shying ferociously at every stray pig, and standing up on  end at the vision of a donkey, until the corrective influence of the spur  brought him to a better state of mind, whereupon he collected himself, and  settled into a grand rhythmical trot.</p>
<p>The hunter was white with dust and foam by the time  Bothwell rode him into the stable-yard at The Spaniards, where nothing but  disappointment awaited him. He heard that Miss Heathcote had left home early on  the previous morning. One of the lads had taken her portmanteau to Bodmin Road,  and she had walked there alone, in time for the eight-o&rsquo;clock train for  Plymouth. She had taken a ticket for Plymouth, the boy believed. Mr. Heathcote  had not yet returned from France. There was nobody at home except Miss  Meyerstein and the little girls.</p>
<p>Bothwell asked to see Miss Meyerstein, and was  shown into the drawing-room, where that worthy woman soon came to him, full of  trepidation. Her eyelids were swollen with weeping, and her cheeks were pallid  with care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Heathcote may think it my fault,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I  have telegraphed to him; but there has been no answer yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where Miss Heathcote was going when  she left this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the faintest idea. All I know is what  the boy told me. I have tried to make the best of things to the servants, for I  don&rsquo;t want them to suppose that Hilda was running away; but they must have  their own ideas about it, knowing as they do that she was going to be married  next Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind the servants,&rdquo; said Bothwell  impatiently. &ldquo;Let them think what they please. But have you no idea where she  would be likely to go &mdash; to what friend, in what direction? She cannot have so  many friends from whom to choose in such a crisis. She would go to the house  where she was most sure of a welcome, where she would know that her secret  would be kept. What friends has she in Plymouth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None. She never went to Plymouth except for  shopping, sight-seeing, concerts, or something in that way, with her brother,  or with me. She knows no one in Plymouth except her old singing mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may have gone to her,&rdquo; said Bothwell eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly likely. Mdlle. Duprez lives in two rooms.  Hilda would scarcely ask for hospitality there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. She is very fond of Mdlle. Duprez. I  have heard her say so. That is a clue, at any rate. I shall go to Mdlle. Duprez  this afternoon. I must walk across to Penmorval and see my cousin first. She  may know more of Hilda&rsquo;s plans than you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very likely. Mrs. Wyllard is Hilda&rsquo;s most  intimate friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a lady came to call upon Miss Heathcote  a few days ago,&rdquo; said Bothwell. &ldquo;Did you happen to see that lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; answered the Fr&auml;ulein, looking at him  curiously. &ldquo;Yet I can but think that lady had something to do with Hilda&rsquo;s  strange conduct. She is an old friend of yours, I believe &mdash; Lady Valeria  Harborough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have known her for some years. Was she long  with Hilda?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was closeted with her for at least an hour,  and from that time to this I have not seen Hilda&rsquo;s face. She went to her room  soon after Lady Valeria left. She excused herself from appearing at dinner on  account of a headache, and when I went to her door later in the evening she  refused to let me in, and I could hear from her voice that she had been crying.  I went to her room again at seven o&rsquo;clock next morning, for my mind had been  uneasy about her all night; but she was gone. I found two letters, one for Mr.  Heathcote, and one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be kind enough to show me the letter she  wrote to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein reflected for a few moments, being an  eminently cautious person, and then produced Hilda&rsquo;s note from her pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think there can be any harm in showing it  to you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;There is so little in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letter ran thus:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dear Fr&auml;ulein, &mdash; Do not be alarmed at my  disappearance. I have good and sound reasons for cancelling my engagement with  Mr. Grahame &mdash; not because of any wrong act upon his part, but for motives of my  own; and I have decided upon leaving home for some time, as the best way of  getting over the difficulty. Pray let no fuss be made about this sudden change  in my plans. Very few of our neighbours knew anything about the intended  marriage; so I hope there will be less talk than there usually is under such  circumstances. You need have no uneasiness about me, as I am going to act under  the advice of a clever and experienced friend, and I mean to be quite happy in  my own way, amidst new surroundings, and to carry out an old desire of my  heart. You shall hear of me directly I feel myself at liberty to tell you more.  &mdash; Always lovingly yours, HILDA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old desire of her heart,&rdquo; said Bothwell slowly,  staring at the letter, with the keenest mortification expressed in his  countenance.</p>
<p>That cheerfulness which Hilda had assumed in her  letter to the governess smote her lover to the heart. A man&rsquo;s mind is not  subtle enough to cope with the subtleties of a woman&rsquo;s conduct. Hilda&rsquo;s chief  aim in writing that letter had been to hoodwink the Fr&auml;ulein, to satisfy her  with the assurance that she, Hilda, was going away from home in tranquil  spirits and with hopeful views of the future. Bothwell saw in this cheery  letter the evidence of a stony heart, a heart that had never loved him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;An old desire of her heart,&rsquo;&rdquo; he repeated, with a  helpless air. &ldquo;What can that mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a notion,&rdquo; replied the Fr&auml;ulein,  reflecting his helplessness upon her own commonplace countenance, &ldquo;unless it  were that she has an idea of going on the stage. So many girls are mad about  the stage nowadays. And Hilda is so pretty. I know when we had private  theatricals here last Christmas for the twins&rsquo; juvenile party, everybody was in  raptures with Hilda&rsquo;s acting. People told her she would make a great sensation  if she were to appear in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are a parcel of idiots!&rdquo; cried Bothwell  savagely. &ldquo;Yes, I remember the theatricals. I was at the party, you know; and  there was a cub who made love to Hilda. Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cub in question was the eldest son of a  neighbouring landowner, and heir to a fine estate; but Bothwell had looked on  the innocent lad with abhorrence, even in those early days when his own  attachment to Hilda had been in its dawn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she would not think of going on the stage,&rdquo;  said Bothwell, after a pause, during which he had paced up and down the room  two or three times in an agitated way; &ldquo;that is impossible. She would not be  mad enough for that. There must be something else. The desire of her heart.  What can it mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Fr&auml;ulein could not offer any suggestion, except  that idea of the stage. &ldquo;She is so passionately fond of Shakespeare,&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;I have heard her recite the whole of Juliet and Portia without faltering. She  has such a memory. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if she were to come out as Juliet  at Covent Garden next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Meyerstein&rsquo;s sole knowledge of the London  stage was derived from biographies of the Kembles and their contemporaries. She  believed in the two patent theatres as existing facts; and she thought that  Shakespearean <em>d&eacute;butantes</em> were  appearing and taking the town by storm periodically all the year round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go to Plymouth by the five-o&rsquo;clock train,&rdquo;  said Bothwell hurriedly. &ldquo;Will you kindly let my horse stay in your stables and  be looked after till to-morrow morning, Miss Meyerstein? I rode him over here  at a rather unmerciful rate, and he&rsquo;ll be all the better for a rest. I shall  walk to Penmorval, and get myself driven from there to the station. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had gone before the Fr&auml;ulein could answer him;  but that good-natured person rang the bell and requested that Mr. Grahame&rsquo;s  horse might be taken care of for the night, and that anything he required might  be given to him.</p>
<p>Bothwell found his cousin full of sympathy, but was  unable to give him any advice or assistance, as Miss Meyerstein had been. To  Dora he opened his heart fully, showing her Hilda&rsquo;s letter, and breaking out  every now and then into angry denunciations of Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Bothwell, don&rsquo;t be so violent,&rdquo; pleaded Dora,  putting her hand to his lips. &ldquo;I agree with you that it was a wicked thing for  Lady Valeria to do &mdash; to put forward her own weakness in the past and your  wrong-doing as a claim upon you in the present. I can understand poor Hilda&rsquo;s  conduct. She was only too ready to believe that you must naturally care more  for Lady Valeria than for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help me to find her, Dora. That is all I want. I  will soon teach her which it is I love best. But I don&rsquo;t believe she really  cared for me. She had some other fancy &mdash; some other dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Bothwell, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen it in her own handwriting,&rdquo; said  Bothwell moodily; and then he told his cousin of that letter which Hilda had  written to the Fr&auml;ulein, and that curious phrase about an old desire of her  heart.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter27"></a>Chapter 27<br>
  How Such Things End</h2>
<p>&ldquo;An old desire of her heart,&rdquo; repeated Dora  wonderingly. &ldquo;What could that be? I am sure she had but one wish in this world,  and that was to make your life happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that had been so, if she had been  single-hearted, she would not have been so easily frightened away from me,&rdquo;  argued Bothwell. &ldquo;She would have laughed Valeria to scorn, strong in the power  of her own love. No, it was because she was half-hearted that she gave way.  There was this old desire of her heart, which could only be gratified by  throwing me over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell, you are unworthy of her when you talk  like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has proved herself unworthy of me,&rdquo; retorted  Bothwell savagely. &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, it was that beardless cub, young St.  John, she cared for &mdash; an Etonian of nineteen, with a pretty face and missish  manners. Perhaps it was of him she was thinking when she wrote about an old  desire of her heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bothwell, I am ashamed of you. Hilda&rsquo;s heart is  one of the truest that ever beat in a woman&rsquo;s breast. This very foolishness in  running away from her own happiness is only a new proof of her noble nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An old desire of her heart,&rdquo; harped Bothwell;  &ldquo;read me that riddle if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only read it in one way,&rdquo; answered Dora,  after a thoughtful silence. &ldquo;Ever so long before your return from India, Hilda  had an ambition to do something great in music. She had been told that her  voice was of the finest quality, and only required severe training in order to  become an exceptional voice. She wanted to go abroad &mdash; to Milan, Leipsic, Paris  &mdash; she talked of different places in her castle-building &mdash; and to give herself  up to the study of music and the cultivation of her voice. The only difficulty  was, that as Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s sister, and with an independence inherited from  her mother, there was no excuse for her taking up music as a profession, while  it would have seemed unreasonable to leave her friends and her home merely to  improve herself as an amateur. We often discussed this question together, and I  used to advise her to abandon the idea of leaving her brother, whose life would  have been altogether lonely without her. I told her that if ever Mr. Heathcote  married again, she would then be free to do what she liked with her life. But  by and by you appeared upon the scene, and Hilda resumed her love for  fox-hunting, and neglected her piano. After this I heard no more of her  yearning for a higher school of music than she could find in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are right,&rdquo; said Bothwell, with a  penitent look. &ldquo;There is only one person to whom Hilda would be likely to go in  Plymouth, and that is her old singing mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mdlle. Duprez; yes, that is a person whom she  would naturally consult,&rdquo; answered Dora. &ldquo;I know all about Mdlle. Duprez, a  sweet little woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, will you let one of your people drive me to  the station, in time for the next train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure. But you must have something to eat  before you go. You look as if you had not had any lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay I look very miserable. No, I have not  been in the humour for eating since I got Hilda&rsquo;s letter this morning. I walked  half a mile to meet the postman, in my impatience for my true love&rsquo;s letter,  and when it came it was a staggerer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have ridden all the way from Trevena, and  have had nothing to eat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgot all about it; but I will take a crust and  a glass of wine before I start. Has Wyllard heard of Hilda&rsquo;s disappearance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he has been very much troubled about it. He  had set his heart upon this marriage, and on its celebration while he is well  enough to be present. God knows how long he may have strength enough to bear  even as much fatigue as that. He is very angry with Hilda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must not be angry with her. It is my sin that  has caused this misery. I have sown the wind, and I have reaped the whirlwind. You  are very good to bear with me in my trouble, Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was infinitely patient with him, sitting by him  while he took a sandwich and a tumbler of claret; soothing him in his  indignation against Lady Valeria; listening to his remorseful confession of wrong-doing  in the past; bearing with that most tedious of all human creatures, an unhappy  lover. But she had a sense of relief when he was gone, and she heard the  dog-cart wheels rolling along the avenue. Her thoughts of late had been so  concentrated upon her husband and his suffering that it was painful to be  obliged to think of anything outside that sick-room and its sadness.</p>
<p>Bothwell found only disappointment at Plymouth. The  little maid-servant had been thoroughly coached by Mdlle. Duprez before she  left, and had been warned against any mention of Miss Heathcote.</p>
<p>She faced Bothwell with a stolid countenance,  prepared to commit any enormity in the way of false statements; for she was one  of those faithful creatures who, although the soul of truthfulness upon their  own account, will lie valiantly to serve those they love. She said that Mdlle.  Duprez had gone away on business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she alone?&rdquo; asked Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite sure, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she was to meet some one at the station, perhaps.  There was some one going away from Plymouth with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, sir. I feel sure Mdlle. Duprez would  have told me if there had been any one going with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was Miss Heathcote last here?&rdquo; asked Bothwell  abruptly. &ldquo;You know Miss Heathcote &mdash; a pupil &mdash; a young lady from Bodmin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl put on a countenance of profound thought,  as if she were calling upon her memory for a stupendous effort, looking back  into the night of ages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t say, sir; but it was a long time  ago &mdash; quite early in the summer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure she was not here yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O yes, sir. Mademoiselle left Plymouth a week ago,  and nobody called yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, she left Plymouth a week ago, did she, and  nobody called yesterday?&rdquo; repeated Bothwell, with a despairing helplessness  which smote the slavey&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>It seemed a cruel thing to deceive such a  nice-looking, outspoken gentleman &mdash; about his young lady, too &mdash; for it was  evident to Mary Jane that Miss Heathcote must have been keeping company with  this gentleman, and that she had broken off with him. If Mary Jane&rsquo;s fidelity  to the little Frenchwoman had not been firm as a rock, she would have given way  at this point, and told Bothwell the truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly give me Mdlle. Duprez&rsquo;s address,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;I have very important business with her, and should like to telegraph  immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mademoiselle did not leave any address, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not leave any address? A woman of business! But  she would have her letters sent after her, surely,&rdquo; urged Bothwell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. She did not wish her letters to be sent.  She would be on the move, she said; and she would rather risk leaving the  letters here than having them follow her from place to place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an air of reality about these particulars  that convinced Bothwell, whereby he showed his inexperience; for liars always  go into particulars, and prop up their falsehoods with a richness of detail  that is rare in truthful statements.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you really don&rsquo;t know where Mdlle. Duprez is  to be found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; but I am expecting her home at any  moment. She might walk in while we are standing here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she would,&rdquo; said Bothwell. &ldquo;I want much to  see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left his card, and went away, cruelly  disappointed.</p>
<p>And now he set his teeth, like a man who is going  to meet his foe, as he turned his face towards that white-walled villa on one  of the hills above the town, that fair and pleasant place where he had dawdled  away so many summer afternoons, all the while wishing himself anywhere rather  than in that Armida garden, feeling himself a knave and a dastard for being  there. He hated the place now with a deadly hatred. It seemed to him that those  white walls had been built of dead men&rsquo;s bones, as if the house within and  without savoured of the charnel.</p>
<p>The good old man, so fooled, so wronged by a false  wife and false friend, was gone, lying at rest in the cemetery yonder, and  Armida reigned alone in her enchanted garden.</p>
<p>Bothwell walked to Fox Hill at his fastest pace,  hurrying on with bent brow, unobservant of anybody or anything that he passed  on his way, as if he would walk down the angry devil within him. But the devil  was not subjugated when Bothwell entered the classic portico. His livid  countenance, his gloomy eyes scared the sleek young footman from his  after-dinner listlessness.</p>
<p>Yes, Lady Valeria was at home. Bothwell was ushered  into the shadowy drawing-room &mdash; a place of summer darkness, sea-green plush and  tawny satin, an atmosphere of perfume. The verandah beyond the richly-curtained  windows was filled with exotics; creamy-white blossoms were languishing in  Venetian vases on tables and piano. A Japanese embroidered curtain draped the  door of an inner room, and, as Bothwell entered, this curtain was lifted by  those slender fingers he knew so well, and Valeria stood before him, very pale,  seeming taller and slimmer than of old, in her black cashmere gown. She wore no  crape to-day, only that plain cashmere, silkily soft, of densest, most funereal  black, falling in straight folds from the graceful shoulders, clasped at the  throat with a large jet cross, the thin white arms showing like marble under  the long loose sleeves, which fell open from above the elbow. The flowing  draperies had a conventual air, as of an abbess of some severe order; but the  uncovered head, with its coils of soft brown hair, was like the head of a Greek  statue.</p>
<p>Bothwell uttered no word of greeting. He took  Hilda&rsquo;s letter from his breast-pocket, and handed it open to Lady Valeria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your work,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>She read the letter slowly, deliberately, and not a  sign of emotion stirred the marble pallor of her face as she read. She seemed  to weigh every syllable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very sensible little letter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I did  not think it was in Miss Heathcote to take so broad and generous a view of our  position. She is a noble girl, and I shall honour her all the days of my life.  She has cut the knot of a great difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell looked at her incredulously, as if he  doubted his own ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose that I shall abide by this letter?&rdquo;  he asked, in harsh husky tones, which made his voice seem altogether unfamiliar  to Valeria, as if a stranger were speaking to her in Bothwell&rsquo;s semblance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally, my poor Bothwell,&rdquo; she answered, with  her easiest air. &ldquo;I cannot think that your engagement to this very good  commonplace girl was anything more than a <em>pis  aller</em>. You were afraid of your position here, and it seemed to you that the  only safety was in a respectable marriage. The young lady has a little money, I  understand, just enough to keep the wolf from the door, but not enough for any  of the delights of life. And you told yourself that you would do penance for  those happy days up at the hills, that you &mdash; you, Bothwell Grahame &mdash; would  settle down into a grinder of mathematics. A curious fancy &mdash; like that of  some knight of old who, after a youth of passion and storm, turns hermit, and  vegetates in a cave. No, Bothwell, I do not for a moment believe that you ever  seriously cared for this country-bred girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your estimate of my feelings in this matter can be  of very little consequence to either of us,&rdquo; replied Bothwell, without relaxing  a muscle of his moody countenance. &ldquo;It is Miss Heathcote I mean to marry, and  no other woman living. You have stooped so low as to come between me and my  plighted wife. You have put off my marriage, hindered my happiness, frustrated  the desire of my heart; but nothing that you or any one else can do will lessen  my love for the girl I have chosen. If I cannot win her back, I shall go down  to my grave a broken-hearted man. This is what you have done for me, Lady  Valeria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent for some moments, while she stood  looking at him with her pale fixed face, her large violet eyes full of  reproachfulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what I have done for you,&rdquo; she said  slowly, after a long pause: &ldquo;This is what I have done for you. I have tried to  secure to you a life of independence, wealth, the respect of your fellow-men,  who in these days have but one standard of merit &mdash; success. I have flung myself  at your feet, with all the advantages of my birth and fortune &mdash; friends who could  help you &mdash; an assured position; I have offered myself to you as humbly as an  Indian dancing-girl, have debased myself as low, made as little of my merits  and my position. And all I have asked of you is to keep the solemn vows you  made to me in that sweet time when we were both so happy. I have asked you to  be true to your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you had released me from its obligations,  Lady Valeria, after you had flung away the old love-token. Was not that an end  of all things between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been. I accepted my doom. And then  Fate changed all things. I was free, and there was nothing to hinder our  happiness, except your falsehood &mdash; your double falsehood. You were false to  your truest friend, my husband, when you loved me; and now that you could love me  with honour you are false to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am as God made me,&rdquo; answered Bothwell gloomily,  &ldquo;weak and false in the days gone by, when my love for you was stronger with me  than gratitude or honour, but loyal and true to the girl who won me away from  that false love. Shall I go back to the old love now because it is my interest  to do so? O Valeria, how you would despise me! how all good and true women  would scorn me if I could be base enough to be false to that dear engagement  which redeemed me from a false position, which set me right in my own esteem  and before my fellow-men! Granted that I have been weak and inconstant, that I  have proved myself unworthy of the regard with which you honoured me,&rdquo; he went  on, with a touch of tenderness in the voice that had been so hard just now,  moved to compassion perhaps by that pale, despairing look of hers, &ldquo;granted  that I am a poor creature, you can hardly wonder that my soul sickened at a tie  which involved blackest treason against a good man, and my best friend; you can  hardly wonder that I welcomed the dawning of a new love, a love which I could  confess before the world, and on my knees to my God. That love meant  redemption, blessing instead of cursing. And do you suppose that I am afraid of  poverty, or hard work, or a life of obscurity, for the sake of my true love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not changed your mind, then?&rdquo; said  Valeria, trying to be supremely cool, though the hectic spot upon that ashen  cheek told of passionate anger. &ldquo;You mean to marry Miss Heathcote, and teach  dull lads in a Cornish village for the rest of your life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With God&rsquo;s help I mean to win back the girl from  whom you have parted me. I came here this afternoon to tell you that your work  has been only half successful. You have hindered my marriage, but you have not  changed the purpose of my life. Farewell, Valeria, and I pray God that word  between you and me may mean for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; she answered mockingly. &ldquo;Fare according  to your deserts, truest, most generous of men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She put her finger on the little ivory knob of the  electric bell, and the sustained silvery sound vibrated in the silent house.  Then, with a haughty inclination of her head, she disappeared through the  curtained archway as Bothwell left the room by the opposite door.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter28"></a>Chapter 28<br>
  One Who Must Remember</h2>
<p>Edward Heathcote had been away from Paris when Miss  Meyerstein&rsquo;s telegram arrived at the H&ocirc;tel de Bade. He had gone on a journey of  something over a hundred miles on the Western Railway, a journey undertaken  with the idea of adding one more link to the chain which he had been slowly  putting together; one more chapter in the history of Marie Pr&eacute;vol.</p>
<p>He had been disappointed in those who were to have  helped him in his task; and it was to his own patience and resources that he  was for the most part indebted for such progress as he had made. Drubarde, the  ex-police-officer, had been able to do no more than to supply the formal record  of the evidence before the <em>Juge  d&rsquo;Instruction</em>. He could throw no light upon the previous history of the  supposed murderer: he could offer no clue to his subsequent fate.</p>
<p>Sigismond Trottier, from whose keen wit Heathcote  had hoped for such valuable aid, had broken down altogether. He had failed to  furnish any further reminiscences of his old acquaintance Georges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know what the man was like,&rdquo; said  Heathcote, at their last interview. &ldquo;If you could put me into communication  with any artist friend of yours who knew Georges well, and can remember him  well enough to give me his likeness from memory &mdash; were it the slightest sketch  &mdash; I would pay your friend liberally for his work, and be very grateful to you  for bringing the matter about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know no such man,&rdquo; answered Trottier curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very strange. Surely there must be some  such person among those who can remember Georges. You say that his only friends  were of the literary and artistic world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Nom d&rsquo;un nom</em>&rdquo;,  exclaimed Trottier impatiently, &ldquo;I suppose I had better be frank with you. Yes,  it is quite possible there may be some one who knew Georges, and who could give  you such a sketch as you want. But I will not help you to find that person. I  liked Georges &mdash; liked him well, mark you. I have profited by his generosity,  have gone to him for help when I was in very low water. I am not going to turn  and sting my benefactor. Granted that he was an assassin. I can find excuses  even for that crime, for I know how he loved Marie Pr&eacute;vol. I am not going to  help you to hunt him down. If he is alive and has repented his sin, let him  alone, to be dealt with by his Creator and his Judge. What are we that we  should pretend to condemn or to punish him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have sworn to myself to find the last link in  the chain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you want to hunt this man down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my secret. I have a motive, and a very  powerful one. It may be that I have no intention to betray the wretch to  justice; that when the tangled skein shall be unravelled, and the mystery of  that man&rsquo;s life made clear, that in the hour of success I may be merciful, may  hold my hand, and keep the murderer&rsquo;s secret from the outside world. But I want  to know that secret, I want to be able to stand face to face with that man and  to say, &lsquo;You are the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her lover; you are the  murderer of the helpless girl who went alone to England, having in her  possession certain papers which threw too strong a light upon your guilty past.  You, who have held your head erect before the world, and have passed for a man  of honour and probity, you are the remorseless villain whose life stands twice  forfeited to the law.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote was pacing up and down the room,  intensely agitated. He had abandoned himself wholly to the passion of the  moment, forgetful of Trottier&rsquo;s presence, forgetful of all things except that  one fixed purpose of his mind which had become almost monomania.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you gain by this?&rdquo; asked Trottier,  wondering at this new aspect of his English friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Revenge! There is enough of the old Adam left in  the best of us to make revenge sweet. What must it be to a man who has lost the  one delight that made life worth living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help you to your revenge,&rdquo; answered  Trottier. &ldquo;I was fond of Georges. I hope you may never be able to look in his  face and accuse him of the past. I hope he may be spared that shame. I cannot  for the life of me understand why you should pursue a stranger with such deadly  hatred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my secret, I say again. If you will not  help me, so be it. I must go on working on my own account. But the face &mdash; the  face &mdash; that is, perhaps, the only identification possible. The links of the  chain fall into their places &mdash; the facts that I have slowly gathered all point  to one conclusion; but absolute identification is impossible until I can find a  portrait of the man who called himself Georges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not offended with me, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Trottier, I understand your refusal; I respect  your loyalty to an old friend. But I must get the portrait I want, somehow,  without your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus ended all hope of aid from Sigismond Trottier.  Drubarde, on the other hand, had assured his client that he saw no new clue to  the discovery of the missing murderer. If that murderer were indeed identical  with the man who met L&eacute;onie Lemarque at Charing Cross, if he had surpassed  himself in crime by the murder of that helpless girl, it was for the English  police, to hunt him down. With such a man as Joseph Distin to inspire their  movements, the English police &mdash; making due allowance for the dulness of a <em>rosbif</em>-eating nation &mdash; ought to work  wonders; and here was a case which offered the chances of distinction; here was  an assassin going about red-handed, as it were, after a murder not three months  old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You expect me to find the murderer of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol, a man who escaped us ten years ago; and here are your pampered and  over-paid English detectives who cannot find the man who threw L&eacute;onie Lemarque  out of a railway-carriage last July. Is that common sense, do you think, Mr.  Heathcote? No, sir; in Paris I am on my own ground. I know this great city from  cellar to garret &mdash; her bridges, her suburbs, her quarries, her sewers, and caverns,  and waste places, all the holes and crannies where crime and vice have hidden  for the last forty years; but from the moment your criminal has got to the  other side of the Channel, I wash my hands of him. My talents can serve you no  further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Heathcote recompensed the police-officer  handsomely for the very little he had done; and so they parted, M. Drubarde  vastly pleased with his client, but still better pleased with himself. He was a  man whose benign consciousness of his own value in the social scale mellowed  with advancing years.</p>
<p>Having been thus abandoned by both his gifted  coadjutors, Edward Heathcote worked on by his own lights. There was one person,  he told himself, who might be able to assist him &mdash; one person whose chief  desire in life must be to see the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol and her lover  brought to his doom. Among the few scraps of information which Trottier had  given to his friend there was the fact that the dowager Baronne de Maucroix,  the widowed mother of the murdered man, was still living. She resided at her  ch&acirc;teau in Normandy, where she led a life of strictest seclusion, devoting  herself to acts of charity and to the severest religious exercises.</p>
<p>It was in the hope of obtaining an interview with  this lady that Heathcote left Paris upon the very morning on which Miss  Meyerstein telegraphed the news of Hilda&rsquo;s flight. He had no letter of  introduction, no credentials to offer to Mdme. de Maucroix, except the one fact  of his keen interest in the after-fate of her son&rsquo;s murderer. There was some  audacity in the idea of so presenting himself before a venerable recluse of  ancient family, a woman who, according to Sigismond Trottier, had been  distinguished in her youth for pride and exclusiveness; a woman who had ranked  herself with the Cond&eacute;s and the Mortemarts, who had ignored the house of  Orleans, and loathed the Imperial rule.</p>
<p>The ch&acirc;teau of the Maucroix family was about five  miles on the eastward side of Rouen. It was situate on low ground, a little way  from the banks of the Seine &mdash; an imposing pile of Gothic architecture, guarded  by a moat, and approached by an avenue of funereal yews. The surrounding  landscape was flat and uninteresting. The broad bright river, winding in bold  curves across the level meads, with here and there a willowy islet, gave a  certain charm to scenery which would otherwise have been without a redeeming  feature. Far off in the distance the chimney-shafts and spires of Rouen rose  dark against the gray October sky.</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote felt the depressing influence of  those level fields, the gloom of that dark avenue and sunless day. It seemed to  him as if he were going into a grave, a place whence life and hope had fled for  ever.</p>
<p>He crossed the low stone bridge which spanned the  moat, and found himself in an old-fashioned garden of that stately period which  gave grandeur to the fountains and parterres of Versailles. Here, too, there  were large marble basins, Tritons and Nereids: but the fountains were not  playing; there was no pleasant plashing of silvery water-drops to break the  dreary stillness of that deserted garden. Everything was in perfect order, not  a withered leaf upon the velvet lawns or the smooth gravel paths. But even  amidst this neatness there was a neglected look. No flowers brightened the dark  borders. There were only the gloomy evergreens of a century&rsquo;s growth, some of  them pyramids of dark foliage, others cut into fantastic shapes, an artistic  development of the gardeners of the past, which had been carefully preserved by  the gardeners of the present.</p>
<p>A white-haired <em>ma&icirc;tre  d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</em> came out into the echoing hall to answer the stranger&rsquo;s inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame la Baronne is at home,&rdquo; he replied stiffly.  &ldquo;Madame rarely goes out of doors, except to her church, or, under peculiar  circumstances, to her poor. Madame la Baronne receives no one except her  priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope that Madame will make another exception in  my favour,&rdquo; said Heathcote quietly. &ldquo;Be good enough to take her that letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had written to Mdme. de Maucroix before leaving  Paris, and he hoped that this letter would serve him as an &ldquo;open sesame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Madame, &mdash; For particular reasons of my own, I am  keenly desirous to trace the murderer of your son; and, believing myself to be  already on the right track, I venture to entreat the favour of an interview. I  am an Englishman of good birth and education, and I shall know how to respect  any confidence with which you may honour me. Accept, Madame, the assurance of  my high consideration,</p>
<p class="note">EDWARD HEATHCOTE.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;To the Baroness de Maucroix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote was shown into a room leading out of the  hall, the first of a suite of rooms opening one into another in a remote  perspective. The doors were open, and the visitor could see to the end of the  vista. The parquetted floors, with the cold light reflected on their polished  surface from the high narrow windows, the sculptured pediments above the doors,  the crystal girandoles, the sombre-looking pictures &mdash; all had an old-world air,  and gave the idea of a house which strangers visited now and then as a monument  of the past, but which had long been empty of domestic life and warmth and  comfort. The far-off echo of his own footsteps startled Heathcote as he slowly  paced the polished floor.</p>
<p>He had not long to wait. The <em>ma&icirc;tre d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel</em> appeared after about ten minutes&rsquo; interval,  evidently astonished at the result of his mission, and informed Heathcote that  the Baroness would see him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mdme. la Baronne is old and in weak health,  Monsieur,&rdquo; said the servant, who had grown gray in the service of his mistress,  and who worshipped her. &ldquo;I hope your business with her is not of an agitating  kind. She seemed much troubled by your letter. A violent shock might kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no violent shock, my friend,&rdquo;  replied Heathcote kindly. &ldquo;I shall be obliged to talk to Mdme. la Baronne of  painful memories, but I shall be careful of her feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Monsieur will pardon me for making the  suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old servant led the way up the wide  semicircular staircase to a corridor above, and to a suite of rooms over those  which Heathcote had seen below. They passed through an anteroom, and then  entered by a curtained doorway which led into Mdme. de Maucroix&rsquo;s sitting-room,  the only room which she had occupied for the last ten years. The <em>salons</em> and music-rooms, the library and  card-room on the lower floor, had remained empty and desolate since her son&rsquo;s  death. Her bedchamber and dressing-room were situated behind this small <em>salon</em>, and another door opened into the  suite of apartments which had been occupied by her son. These she visited and  inspected daily. They were kept in the order in which he had left them, on his  last journey to Paris. Not an object, however trifling, had been changed.</p>
<p>There were logs burning on the hearth, although the  first chill winds of autumn had not yet been felt: but the Baroness kept a fire  in her room all the year round. The cheery blaze and a large black poodle of  almost super-canine intelligence were her only companions. On an exquisite  little buhl table by her armchair lay her missal and her <em>Imitation of Christ</em>. These two books were her only literature.</p>
<p>The poodle advanced slowly across the Persian  carpet to meet the visitor, and made a deliberate inspection. The result was  satisfactory, for he gave three or four solemn swings of his leonine tail, and  then composed himself in a dignified position in front of the fire.</p>
<p>The Baroness, who was seated in a deep and spacious  armchair, acknowledged Heathcote&rsquo;s entrance only by a dignified bend of her  head. She was a woman of remarkable appearance even in the sixty-seventh year  of her age. She possessed that classic beauty of feature which time cannot take  away. No matter that the pale pure skin was faded from its youthful bloom, that  the lines of care and thought were drawn deeply upon the broad brow and about the  melancholy mouth: the outline of the face was such as a sculptor would have  chosen for a Hecuba or a Dido.</p>
<p>She was above the average height of women, and sat  erect in her high-backed chair with a majestic air which impressed Edward  Heathcote. Her plainly fashioned black silk gown and India muslin fichu  recalled Delaroche&rsquo;s famous picture of Marie Antoinette, and her cast of  countenance in some wise resembled that of the martyred queen; but the features  were more perfect in their harmony, the outline was more statuesque. In a word,  the Baroness had been lovelier than the Queen.</p>
<p>She motioned Heathcote to a chair on the opposite  side of the hearth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are interested in tracing the murderer of my  son,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That is strange &mdash; after ten years &mdash; and you an Englishman!  What concern can you have in the fate of that man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was the faintest quiver in her voice as she  spoke of her son, otherwise her tones were clear and self-possessed; her large  dark eyes contemplated the stranger with calmest scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is in some wise my secret, Madame,&rdquo; replied  Heathcote. &ldquo;I will be as frank with you as I can; but there are motives which I  must keep to myself until this investigation of mine has come to an end &mdash; until  I can tell you that I have found the murderer of Marie Pr&eacute;vol, that I have  proof positive of his guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, Monsieur &mdash; what then?&rdquo; asked the  Baroness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, it is perhaps you who should be the  arbiter of the murderer&rsquo;s fate; in the event of such evidence as may be  conclusive to you and me being also strong enough to insure his conviction by a  French jury. French jurymen are so merciful, Madame, and your judges so full of  sentiment. They would perhaps regard the death of those two young people &mdash;  slain in the flower of their youth &mdash; as an outbreak of jealous feeling for  which the murderer was to be pitied rather than punished. The law is always  kind to the shedders of blood. It is the child who steals a loaf, or the  journalist who by some carelessly edited paragraph wounds the fine feelings of  our aristocracy &mdash; it is for such as these there is no mercy. But in the event  of my being able to find the assassin, and to furnish conclusive evidence of  his guilt, what would be your line of conduct, Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dowager was slow to reply. She waited with fixed  brows, meditative, absorbed, for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a time,&rdquo; she said at last, &ldquo;when I  should have been quick to reply to such a question &mdash; when I thirsted for the  blood of my son&rsquo;s murderer. Yes, when my parched lips longed to drink that  blood, as the savage laps the life-stream of his foe. But years have worked  their chastening influence &mdash; years given up to religious exercises, mark you,  Monsieur, not wasted upon the frivolities of this world. I have sought for  consolation from no carnal sources. Pleasure has never crossed the threshold of  my dwelling since my son&rsquo;s corpse was carried in at my door. Some people try to  forget their griefs; they steep themselves in the banalities of this life; they  stifle memory amidst the intoxications of a frivolous existence. I am not one  of those. I have nursed my sorrow, lived with it, lived upon it, until looking  back it seems to me that even in these long slow years of mourning I have not  been actually separated from my dead son. In my prayers, in my thoughts, in my  waking and sleeping, his image has been ever present, the most precious part of  my existence. I believe that he is in heaven, that such prayers as have been  breathed for him, together with the services of the Church, must have shortened  his time of purgation, that his purified soul is at rest in the blessed home  where I hope some day to rejoin him. Confession, penance, mortifications of all  kinds have subjugated the natural evil in my character. My cry for vengeance  has long been dumb. If that cruel murderer yet lives, I hope that he may be  brought by suffering to repentance. I do not hunger for his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was such an air of lofty feeling, such  absolute truth in the tone and manner of Madame de Maucroix, that Heathcote  could but admire and respect this cold serenity of grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has brought my gray hairs in sorrow to the  grave,&rdquo; said the Baroness softly, &ldquo;but I have been taught to pity all sinners,  as our Saviour pitied the worst and vilest, with inexhaustible compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madame, if you who so loved your son can be  merciful, there is no one living who has a right to exact the murderer&rsquo;s blood.  And now forgive me if I venture to question you about that sad story. For some  time past I have devoted myself to this case. I have slowly put together the  links of a chain of evidence, until there is but little wanting to complete the  circle. Your knowledge may furnish me with those missing links. Tell me in the  first place whether you believe &mdash; and have always believed &mdash; that the man  called Georges was the murderer of your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never doubted his guilt. There was no one  else; no one whom my boy had ever offended. Remember, Monsieur, he was but  three-and-twenty years of age, amiable, generous, accomplished, beloved by all  who knew him. He had not an enemy, except the man whose jealousy he had  aroused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he know the man Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappily, yes. Had he never known Georges he  would never have fallen in love with Mdlle. Pr&eacute;vol. Georges was an intimate  friend of an artist whom my son patronised; a remarkably clever painter, who  twelve or thirteen years ago promised to become famous, but who never fulfilled  that promise. Maxime sat to this M. Tillet for a half-length portrait &mdash; the man  had a genius for portraits &mdash; and Tillet introduced him to the Bohemian circle  in which Georges was living. It was a very small circle, consisting of about a  dozen men in all, mostly journalists and painters. Georges appeared to have a  liking for my son; Maxime&rsquo;s youth and freshness interested him; he said, in a  world where everybody was <em>blas&eacute;</em>. He  invited him to little suppers of three or four intimates, at which Marie Pr&eacute;vol  was present. From that hour my son&rsquo;s head was turned. He fell passionately in  love with this actress. He thought of her by day and night, abandoned himself  utterly to his idolatry, desired ardently to make her his wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not believe that she was married to  Georges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was his difficulty. In his love and reverence  for her he could not endure to think of her as in a degraded position; yet if  she were already a wife, Maxime could never hope to win her. In his mad,  headstrong love he was ready to forgive her past career, to redeem her from her  degraded position, and make her the Baroness de Maucroix. He, who had been  educated in the pride of race as in the gospel, was willing to marry an actress  with a tarnished character!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he make you the confidante of his passion,  Madame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For some time he kept his secret from me; but I  knew that he was unhappy, and I knew that there was only one kind of grief  possible in such a life as his, where nature and fortune had been alike lavish.  He had been my companion and adviser from the day of my widowhood; and we were  nearer and dearer to each other, and more in each other&rsquo;s confidence, than  mothers and sons usually are. More than once I had entreated him to tell me the  nature of his trouble, to let me help him, if that were possible; and he had  told me that there was no one who could help him in the great crisis of his  life. &lsquo;I must be either the happiest or the most miserable of men,&rsquo; he said.  One night I went into his room and found him ill, feverish, in a half-delirious  state, raving about Marie Pr&eacute;vol. This broke the ice, and during the brief  illness that followed &mdash; the effect of cold, fatigue, excitement, and late hours  &mdash; I obtained his confidence. He told me the whole story of his love for this  beautiful actress; how at their first meeting he had been enslaved by her  exquisite loveliness, her indescribable charm of manner. He protested that her  nature was purity itself, despite her false position. She was the victim of  circumstances. And then he told me that Georges spoke of her as his wife,  treated her with a respect rarely shown to women of light character; and this  thought that his idol was another man&rsquo;s wife filled my unhappy son with  despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You warned him of the danger of his position, no  doubt, Madame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not once only, but again and again. With all the  fervour of a mother&rsquo;s prayers did I implore him to escape from this fatal  entanglement. I urged him to travel, to go to Spain, Italy, Africa &mdash; Algiers  was at that time a favourite resort for men of fashion &mdash; anywhere so long as he  withdrew himself from the fascination which could end only in ruin. But it was  in vain that I pleaded. Passion was stronger than common sense, duty, or  religion. He was caught on a wheel from which he would not even try to  extricate himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your affection could do nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. From that time my son was lost to me. He  shrank from confiding in me, not because I had been severe &mdash; never had I  breathed one uncharitable word against the woman he loved. His love made her  sacred to me; but I had spoken the words of common sense. I had tried to stand  between him and his own folly. That was enough. He loved his madness better  than he loved me &mdash; he who had been until that time almost an adoring son. When  the time came for us to come here for the autumn he refused to leave Paris, and  I was too anxious to allow him to remain there alone. I stayed at our house in  the Rue de l&rsquo;Universit&eacute;, where my son had his apartments, his private keys and  private staircase, by which he could come in at any hour, without his movements  being known to the household. I hardly know how he lived or what he did during  those long days of July and August, while all our circle of acquaintance were  away by the sea or in the mountains, and while we seemed to be alone in a  deserted city. Several of the theatres were closed during those months; but the  Porte-Saint-Martin had made a great success with a fairy piece, and kept open  for the strangers who filled Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that my son went every night to the  theatre, that he saw Marie Pr&eacute;vol at every opportunity, and that his only  motive in life was his love for her. For me the days went by in dull monotony.  A presentiment of evil oppressed me, waking or sleeping. Long before the coming  of calamity I felt the agony of an inevitable grief. I knew not what form my  misery would take; but I knew that my boy was doomed. When they brought home  his bleeding corpse in the summer evening, four-and-twenty hours after the  murder, I met the messengers of evil as one prepared for the worst. I had lost  him long before his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke with infinite composure. She had  familiarised herself with her sorrow, lived with it, cherished it, until grief  had lost its power to agitate. Not a tone faltered as she spoke of that  tragical past. Her countenance was as calm as marble. Every line in the noble  face spoke of a settled sorrow, every line had become unalterable as the lines  of a statue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say, Madame, that the painter Tillet was upon  intimate terms with Georges,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Is this M. Tillet still living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so. I never heard of his death. He has  clever sons whose names are before the public. I have heard people mention  them, though I have never seen their works. My knowledge of secular art and  literature ceased ten years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to find M. Tillet,&rdquo; said  Heathcote. &ldquo;He is the very man I want to discover &mdash; a man whose pencil could  recall for me the face of the missing Georges. You say, Madame, that he was an  intimate friend of Georges, and that he was a clever portrait-painter. Such a  man would not have forgotten his friend&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you knew what Georges was like, do you suppose  you could find him?&rdquo; asked the Baroness, without eagerness, but with a grave  intensity, which accentuated the severe lines of her countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Heathcote. &ldquo;I believe that in  four-and-twenty hours I could lay my hand on the assassin&rsquo;s shoulder and say,  &lsquo;Thou art the man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four-and-twenty hours? There is a distance,  then, between you. The man you suspect is not in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he is not in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if, by means of M. Tillet&rsquo;s art, you are able  to assure yourself of his identity, how will you deal with him? Would you  deliver him up to justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Madame, who knows? Our great poet has said  that there is a divinity which shapes our ends &mdash; not as we have planned them.  If the assassin of your son is the person I believe him to be, he is already  punished. He is a doomed man. Joy and hope and comfort are dead for him. The  criminal court and the guillotine could be no harder ordeal than the suffering  of his daily life. If he is guilty, Heaven has not been blind to his sin. The  Eternal Doomsman has pronounced his sentence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A faint flush illuminated the settled pallor of  Mdme. de Maucroix&rsquo;s countenance, a light sparkled in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew that he would not escape,&rdquo; she said, in a  low voice. &ldquo;Heaven is just.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will kindly give me M. Tillet&rsquo;s address,  Madame, I shall be deeply obliged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can only tell you an address of ten years ago.  M. Tillet lived at that time in the Rue Saint-Guillaume. He was then in the  flush of success, and I have heard my son say that he had a handsome apartment.  Where he may live now in his decadence I know not. But his sons are known, and  you will have no difficulty in getting information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I apprehend not, Madame. And now, if you will  permit me, I would ask one more question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As many as you please, Monsieur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you in your possession any scrap of Georges&rsquo;  writing &mdash; any note, however brief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. There was no such thing found among my boy&rsquo;s  effects. The police requested that such a letter or letters should be looked  for. They, too, were anxious to procure a specimen of the suspected man&rsquo;s  writing; but, although I looked most carefully through all my son&rsquo;s papers, I  discovered no such letter. There were two or three notes from Tillet conveying  invitations from Georges, but there was no direct communication from the man  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was doubtless a man who had taken the old  saying to heart,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Litera  scripta manet.</em>&rsquo; I have to thank you, Madame, for your gracious reception,  and, above all, for your candour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a life like mine, Monsieur, there is no room  for untruthfulness or hypocrisy. My existence moves in too narrow a circle. I  have no interest outside my son&rsquo;s grave, and my own hope of salvation. Perhaps,  before you leave this house, you would like to see the apartments in which  Maxime lived. They have been kept just as he left them when he went back to  Paris for the last time after the shooting-season.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like much to see them,&rdquo; said Heathcote,  standing hat in hand before the Baroness.</p>
<p>It seemed to him that she had a melancholy pleasure  in dwelling on the image of her murdered son; that it would gratify her to show  the rooms which he had inhabited, even to a stranger.</p>
<p>The Baroness rose, a tall erect figure, dignified  and graceful in advancing age as she had been in the bloom of her beauty, when  Louis Philippe was king. She moved with stately steps towards the door at the  end of her <em>salon</em>, and led the way  into the adjoining room.</p>
<p>It was a large room, richly furnished, and full of  such luxuries as a young man loves. Dwarf book-cases lined the four walls. On  one side, above the array of richly-bound volumes, appeared a costly collection  of arms, both modern and antique. The fireplace was a kind of alcove, furnished  with luxurious seats, upholstered in copper-red velvet. Old tapestry, old miniatures,  bronzes, curios of all kinds filled the room with endless varieties of form and  colour. A tapestry curtain screened the door of the adjoining bedchamber. The  Baroness drew aside the heavy tapestry with her wasted hand, and led the  stranger into the room where her son had slept through so many peaceful nights  in his happy youth.</p>
<p>A carved ivory crucifix of large size, a <em>chef-d&rsquo;oeuvre</em>, yellow with age, hung  over the pillow on which that young head had so often slumbered. The attenuated  form of the Redeemer showed in sharp relief against the olive-velvet draperies  of the bed. Heathcote observed that the Persian rug beside the bed was worn in  the centre, as if with much use, and he could guess whose knees had left the  trace of prayerful hours upon the fabric, as he saw the eyes of the Dowager  fixed upon that pallid figure of her martyred Saviour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have lived half my days for the last ten years  in this room,&rdquo; she said quietly. &ldquo;I hope to die here. If I have sense and  knowledge left me, I shall creep here when I feel that my end is near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the mantelpiece hung Maxime de Maucroix&rsquo;s  portrait, the picture of a bright young face, perfect in form and colouring,  but most beautiful by reason of the hope and gladness that shone in the sunny  eyes, the frank clear outlook of an untainted soul. Heathcote could understand  the fascination exercised over a woman like Marie Pr&eacute;vol by such a man as this,  with all the adjuncts of rank, talent, wealth, and fashion.</p>
<p>They went back to the Baroness&rsquo;s <em>salon</em>, and Heathcote took his leave, to  return to Rouen, where he stayed the night.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter29"></a>Chapter 29<br>
  The Last Link</h2>
<p>Heathcote returned to Paris on the morning after  his interview with the Baronne, and found Miss Meyerstein&rsquo;s telegram, and with  it Hilda&rsquo;s long and explanatory letter. The girl expressed herself so  temperately, with such firm resolve, such generous feeling, that her brother  could not find it in his heart to be angry with her for what she had done. He  had never desired her marriage with Bothwell Grahame; he desired it least of  all now. Wedding-bells would have been indeed out of tune with the dark purpose  for which he was working. He had yielded at Dora Wyllard&rsquo;s entreaty; he had  yielded because his sister&rsquo;s happiness had seemed to be at stake. But now that  she had of her own accord relinquished her lover, he was not inclined to  interfere with her decision.</p>
<p>Nor was he alarmed at Miss Meyerstein&rsquo;s telegram,  informing him of Hilda&rsquo;s departure in the early morning. His faith in his  sister&rsquo;s common sense and earnestness was of the strongest. The tone of her  letter was not that of a girl who was bent upon any perilous course of action.  He felt assured that she would do nothing to bring discredit upon her name or  her family; and that if it pleased her to disappear for a little while, so as  to give her lover the opportunity of jilting her in a gentleman-like manner,  she might be safely intrusted with the management of her own life.</p>
<p>She was well provided with money, having the cheque  which her brother had sent her a few days before her flight. There was  therefore no ground for uneasiness at the idea of her helplessness among  strangers. A girl of nineteen, sensibly brought up, with strong self-respect,  and two hundred and fifty pounds in her possession, could hardly come to grief  anywhere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish she had taken her maid with her,&rdquo; thought  Heathcote, and this was almost his only regret in the matter.</p>
<p>For not a moment did he doubt that Bothwell would  take advantage of his recovered liberty, and go back to his old love. Hilda had  dwelt in her letter upon Lady Valeria&rsquo;s grace and distinction, her fortune, and  the position to which she could raise her husband. Edward Heathcote did not  give Bothwell credit for the strength of mind which could resist such  temptations. A weak, yielding nature, a man open to the nearest influence. That  was how he judged Bothwell Grahame.</p>
<p>He remembered the young man&rsquo;s conduct at the  inquest, his resolute refusal to say what he had done with his time in  Plymouth, rather than bring Lady Valeria&rsquo;s name before the public. That dogged  loyalty had argued a guilty love; and could Heathcote doubt that when called  upon to choose between the old love, and all its surrounding advantages, and  the new love, with its very modest expectations, Bothwell would gladly return  to his first allegiance?</p>
<p>Assured of this, Heathcote was content that his  sister should live down her sorrow after her own fashion. Better, he thought,  that she should take her own way of bearing her trouble; just as he himself had  done in the days long gone, when the light of his life had been suddenly  extinguished. It was not in sluggish repose that he had sought the cure for his  grief, but in work, and in movement from place to place. He remembered Hilda&rsquo;s  often-expressed desire to study at one of the great musical academies of the  Continent; and he thought it very likely she had gone to Florence or Milan. He  had seen Mdlle. Duprez and Hilda putting their heads together, had heard the  little woman protest that such a voice as Hilda&rsquo;s ought to be trained under an  Italian sky. He could read some such purpose as this between the lines of his  sister&rsquo;s letter. This being so, he was content to let things take their course;  more especially as his own mind was full of another subject, and his own life  was devoted to another purpose than running after a fugitive sister. He wrote a  reassuring letter to poor Miss Meyerstein, and he waited patiently for further  tidings from Hilda.</p>
<p>His first business after his return to Paris was to  find Eug&egrave;ne Tillet, the portrait-painter. He had noticed the signature of  Tillet on some of the illustrations in the <em>Petit  Journal</em>, and he inquired at the office of that paper for the artist&rsquo;s  address, and for other information respecting him. He was told that M. Tillet  lived in the Rue du Bac, with his father and mother, and that he was one of a  numerous family, all artistic. His father was Eug&egrave;ne Tillet, who had once been  a fashionable painter, but who had dropped out of the race, and was now almost  entirely dependent on the industry of his sons and daughters.</p>
<p>This made things easy enough, it would seem: but  Heathcote remembered his failure with Sigismond Trottier, and he feared that in  Eug&egrave;ne Tillet he might perhaps encounter the same loyal regard for an  unfortunate friend. Again, Tillet might have been warned by Trottier, and might  be on his guard against any act which could betray the assassin whom he had  once reckoned amongst his friends.</p>
<p>It was certain that the painter would remember his  friend&rsquo;s face; it was probable that he had some likeness of the missing man in  his sketch-book. He was out-at-elbows, idle, a man content to live luxuriously  on the labour of others. Such a man would be especially open to pecuniary  temptation. He had begun with brilliant successes, had ended in failure and  obscurity. Such a man must have suffered all the acutest agonies of wounded  vanity, and he would be therefore easily moved by praise.</p>
<p>Arguing thus with himself during his walk to the  Rue du Bac, Heathcote arranged his course of action. He would approach M.  Tillet as an amateur, a collector of modern art, and would offer to purchase  some of his sketches. This would lead naturally to an inspection of old  sketch-books, and to confidences of various kinds from the painter.</p>
<p>As a lawyer and a man of the world, Edward Heathcote  considered himself quite equal to the occasion.</p>
<p>It was three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon when he rang  the bell on the second floor of the house over the glover&rsquo;s. The neat-looking  maid-servant who answered his summons informed him that M. Tillet <em>p&egrave;re</em> was at home. Everybody else was  out. The <em>ci-devant</em> portrait-painter  was smoking the pipe of peace by the family hearth, a human monument of  departed ambitions, bright hopes that had melted into darkness, softly and  slowly, like the red light of a fusee.</p>
<p>He yawned as he rose to receive his visitor. He  stood in front of the hearth, tall, long-limbed, slouching, slovenly, but with  a countenance that still showed traces of intellectual power, despite the  evident decadence, physical and mental, of the man. His complexion had the  unhealthy pallor which indicates a life spent within four walls; and already  that pallor was assuming the sickly greenish hue of the absinthe-drinker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to apologise for intruding upon you without  any introduction, M. Tillet,&rdquo; began Heathcote, taking the seat to which the  painter motioned him; &ldquo;but although I have neither card nor letter, I do not  come to you entirely as a stranger. I was yesterday with the Baronne de  Maucroix, a lady whom you must remember, as her son was once your friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mdme. de Maucroix, poor soul!&rdquo; muttered the  painter. &ldquo;I am not likely to forget her. I believe that portrait of mine has  been of more comfort to her than anything else in the world since her son&rsquo;s  unhappy death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a remarkable portrait,&rdquo; said Heathcote, with  enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He was careful to show neither interest nor  curiosity about the circumstances of Maucroix&rsquo;s death. He was there in the  character of an amateur, interested solely in art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is one of the finest pictures I ever saw,&rdquo; he  went on. &ldquo;Neither Reynolds nor Gainsborough ever painted anything better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur is too good. Your English painters have  produced some very fine portraits. There are heads by Gainsborough and Reynolds  which leave very little to be desired; though the treatment of the arms and  hands is sometimes deplorably flimsy. You others have not the realistic force  of the Paris school. Your Millais has a Rubens-like <em>brio</em>, but he paints with a butter-knife. Your Leighton has grace,  and a keen feeling for beauty, but he is cold and shadowy. So you saw my  portrait of poor Maucroix? Yes, I think it was in my best manner. But it was in  the portraiture of women that I was strongest. I have been told by too partial  judges that the head over the escritoire yonder is worthy of Titian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an exquisite piece of colour,&rdquo; answered  Heathcote, rising to scrutinise the unfinished Duchess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a genius when I painted that picture,&rdquo; said  Tillet, with a moody look; &ldquo;but it is all past and done with. I am glad to  think you appreciated my portrait of the Baron de Maucroix, a splendid subject,  a fine young fellow. May I ask the name of my gracious admirer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Heathcote,&rdquo; said the visitor, laying  his card upon the table in front of M. Tillet.</p>
<p>The painter stared at him with a look of extreme  surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathcote!&rdquo; he repeated, and then examined the  card.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem surprised at the mention of my name,&rdquo;  said Heathcote. &ldquo;Have you ever heard it before to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter had recovered himself by this time. He  told himself that his visitor was in all probability Hilda&rsquo;s brother, and that  it was his duty to his fair young friend to conceal the fact of her residence  under that roof.</p>
<p>He was capable of so much perspicuity as this, but  he was quite incapable of prompt action. He was too listless to make an excuse  for leaving his visitor, in order to put the servant upon her guard, and so  prevent Hilda&rsquo;s appearance before Mr. Heathcote&rsquo;s departure. The chances were,  thought Tillet, that the Englishman&rsquo;s visit would be brief; while, on the other  hand, Hilda had gone to the Conservatoire, and was not likely to return for  some time.</p>
<p>Having argued thus with himself, the painter was  content to trust to the chapter of accidents, which had been of late years the  principal chapter in the history of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind smoke,&rdquo; he murmured, with a  longing look at his cigarette-case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a smoker myself, and I delight in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this, Monsieur Tillet offered his case to the  Englishman, and lighted a cigarette for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have heard your name before,&rdquo; he said  slowly and reflectively. &ldquo;I think it must have been from my friend Trottier,  Sigismond Trottier, one of the contributors to the <em>Taon</em>. He has mentioned an English acquaintance called Heathcote.  Perhaps you are that gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know Trottier,&rdquo; answered Heathcote, far  from pleased at finding that the painter and the paragraphist were intimate.</p>
<p>It was not unlikely that Trottier had warned his  friend against answering any inquiries about Georges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I think you must have heard a good deal about  me,&rdquo; said Eug&egrave;ne Tillet, with a satisfied smile. &ldquo;Trottier knew me when I was  in the zenith of my power &mdash; glorious days &mdash; glorious nights those. The days of  Gautier and Gustave Planche, Villemessant, Roqueplan &mdash; the days when there were  wits in Paris, Monsieur. Ah! you should have seen our after-midnight <em>c&eacute;nacle</em> at the Caf&eacute; Riche. How the pale  dawn used to creep in upon our talk! and how we defied the waiters, when,  between two and three o&rsquo;clock, they tried to put out the gas and get rid of us!  I remember how, one night, we all came with candle-ends in our pockets, and  when the waiters began to lower the gas, lit up our candles &mdash; a veritable  illumination. They never tried to put out our lamps after that. Yes, those were  glorious nights, and art was honoured in those days. There was a man called  Georges, a French Canadian, I believe; a man of large fortune and splendid  brains &mdash; he came to a bad end afterwards, I am sorry to say&rdquo; &mdash; this with  airiest indifference. &ldquo;He used to give little suppers at the Caf&eacute; de Paris or  the Maison d&rsquo;Or, suppers of half a dozen at most &mdash; banquets for the gods. I was  generally one of that select circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You painted this friend of yours, no doubt,&rdquo;  suggested Heathcote, &ldquo;this Monsieur Georges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he had a curious antipathy to sitting for his  portrait. I wanted to paint him. He had a fine head, highly paintable. A fine  picturesque head, which was all the more picturesque on account of a  particularly artistic wig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that he wore a wig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Habitually. He had lost his hair in South America  after a severe attack of fever, and it had never grown again. He wore a light  auburn wig, with hair that fell loosely and carelessly over his forehead,  almost touching his eyebrows. The style suited him to perfection, and the wig  was so perfect in its simulation of nature, that I doubt if any one but a  painter or a woman would have detected that it was a wig. He dressed in a  careless semi-picturesque style &mdash; turn-down collar, loose necktie, velvet coat  &mdash; and with that long hair of his, he had altogether the air of a painter or a  poet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you never painted him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never. I have sketched his head many a time from  memory, for my own amusement, both before and after his disappearance; but he  never sat to me. I might have made money by giving the police one of my  sketches, when they were trying to hunt Georges down as a suspected murderer:  but I am not a Judas, to betray the friend at whose table I have eaten,&rdquo; said  the painter, whose Scriptural knowledge was derived solely from the Old  Masters, and who regarded the disciple&rsquo;s crime from a purely social point of  view.</p>
<p>Heathcote was careful to show the least possible  curiosity about the vanished Georges. He listened with the air of a man who is  charmed by a delightful conversationalist, who admires the <em>raconteur</em>, but who has no personal interest in the subject of the  discourse. And Eug&egrave;ne Tillet was accustomed so to talk and so to be heard. He  was an egotist of the first water, and was not a close observer of other  people.</p>
<p>Heathcote was now assured of the one fact which he  wanted to know. The painter had made numerous sketches of his friend, and no  doubt had some of those sketches still in his possession, as they could have  had little value for the dealers. The question now was to get at his  sketch-books as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mention of your sketches recalls the object of  my visit, which your very delightful conversation had made me almost forget,&rdquo;  said Heathcote.</p>
<p>Eug&egrave;ne acknowledged the compliment with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very anxious to become the possessor of a few  of your sketches in black and white, colour, pencil, what you will. There is no  kind of art that I love better than those first airy fancies of the painter&rsquo;s  mind, those jottings of inspiration. I am the possessor of a few very nice  things in that way&rdquo; &mdash; this was strictly true&mdash; &ldquo;sketches by Mulready, Leslie,  Maclise, and many other of our English artists. I should much like to add yours  to my collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eug&egrave;ne Tillet&rsquo;s sallow cheeks flushed faintly at  the compliment. It was very long since any one had offered to buy the work of  his brush or his pencil. It was very long since he had touched money of his own  earning. And here was an English milord, an enthusiastic simpleton, ready to  give him gold and silver for the sweepings of his studio. His pale cheeks  flushed, his faded eyes kindled at the thought. His hands were tremulous as he  unlocked a cupboard, and drew forth three or four dusty sketch-books from the  place where they had lain for the last ten years, neglected, forgotten, counted  as mere lumber.</p>
<p>His hand had long lost its cunning, and, in that  slough of despond into which he had gone down, he had lost even the love of his  art. It has been said that an artist may lose in a twelvemonth the manipulative  power, which it has cost him many years to acquire; and it is a certainty that  Eug&egrave;ne Tillet&rsquo;s hand could not, for the offer of thousands, have produced  anything as good as the worst of the drawings in those half-forgotten  sketch-books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can find anything in these books that you  would care to possess,&rdquo; he said, laying the dusty volumes in front of  Heathcote. &ldquo;You had better wait till I get them dusted for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Heathcote was too eager to endure delay. He  wiped off some of the dust with his cambric handkerchief, and opened the  uppermost volume.</p>
<p>The sketches were full of talent, intensely  interesting to any lover of art. They were sketches over which Edward Heathcote  would have lingered long, under other circumstances. As it was, he had  considerable difficulty in concealing his impatience, and appearing interested  in the book on artistic grounds. He remembered himself so far as to select two  pencil sketches of girlish faces before he closed the first volume, which  contained no drawing that bore upon the object of his search.</p>
<p>The second was also a blank; but from this  Heathcote chose three or four clever caricatures, which the painter cut out at  his request.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must kindly put down your own price for these  things,&rdquo; he said, as he opened the third volume.</p>
<p>On the second page he saw the face he had been  looking for, the face he had expected to see. But, although this thing did not  come upon him as a surprise; although that pencilled likeness, the last link of  the chain, served only to confirm the settled conviction which had gradually  taken possession of his mind, the shock was sharp enough to drive the blood  from his face, to set his heart beating like a sledgehammer.</p>
<p>It was so, then. It was as he had thought, ever  since his conversation with Barbe Leroux. This was the man. This was Marie  Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s lover, and her murderer. This was the cold-blooded assassin of L&eacute;onie  Lemarque.</p>
<p>He sat silent, breathless, staring blankly at the  face before him: a vigorous pencil-drawing of strongly marked features, eager  eyes under drooping hair, a sensitive face, a face alive with passionate  feeling. The eyes looked straight at the spectator; the lips seemed as if, in  the next instant, they would move in speech. The attitude was careless, hands  clasped on the back of a chair, chin resting on the clasped hands, the whole  bust full of power and intention. Yes, just so might an ardent thinker, an  eloquent speaker have looked at one of those midnight gatherings of wits and  romancers. The sketch was evidently an immediate reminiscence, and must have  been made when the subject was a vivid image in the artist&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>Happily for Heathcote&rsquo;s secret, his agitation  entirely escaped Eug&egrave;ne Tillet&rsquo;s notice. The painter was dreamily contemplating  the sketches he had just cut out of his book, and thinking what a great man he  had been when he had made them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have this one,&rdquo; said Heathcote,  when he had recovered himself, &ldquo;and this, and this, and this,&rdquo; he added,  turning the leaves hastily, and choosing at random, so as to make that first  choice less particular.</p>
<p>Monsieur Tillet cut out all that were indicated to  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the man I was talking to you about,&rdquo; he  said, as he laid the portrait of Georges with the rest of the sketches. &ldquo;It is  a wonderful likeness, too, an extraordinary likeness, dashed off at a white  heat one morning, after I had been particularly impressed by the charm of his  society. He was a man in a thousand, poor devil. A pity that he should have got  himself into such a disagreeable scrape later. But he was a fool for running  away. He ought to have given himself up and stood his trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because he would have inevitably been acquitted.  You may murder anybody you like in France, if you can show a sentimental motive  for the crime; and this business of poor Georges was entirely a sentimental  murder. He would have had the press and the public with him. The verdict would  have been &lsquo;Not Guilty.&rsquo; The populace would have cheered him as he left the <em>Palais de Justice</em>, the press would have  raved about him, and he would have been the rage in Parisian society for a  month afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you who knew both the victims; you who had  received kindnesses from Maxime de Maucroix &mdash; surely you cannot judge that  double murder with so much leniency,&rdquo; expostulated Heathcote.</p>
<p>The painter shrugged his shoulders with infinite  expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maxime de Maucroix was a most estimable young  man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but what the devil was he doing in that galley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now if you will kindly tell me the sum-total  of my small purchases, I shall have great pleasure in giving you notes for the  amount,&rdquo; said Heathcote, shocked at the Frenchman&rsquo;s cynicism.</p>
<p>Monsieur Tillet handed him his hastily jotted  account. The prices he had put upon his sketches were extremely modest,  considering the man&rsquo;s egotism.</p>
<p>The amount came in all to less than a thousand  francs, but Heathcote insisted upon making the payment fifteen hundred, an  insistence which was infinitely gratifying to fallen genius.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall remember, Monsieur, on my death-bed, that  there was an Englishman who appreciated my work when my countrymen had  forgotten me,&rdquo; he said, with mingled pathos and dignity. &ldquo;Allow me to put up  the sketches for you. I do not think you will ever regret having bought them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Eug&egrave;ne Tillet was searching among the litter  of papers, wood-blocks, and Bristol-board upon his son&rsquo;s table, in the hope of  finding two stray pieces of cardboard within which to guard his sketches, the  door was quickly opened, and two girls came into the room.</p>
<p>The first was Mathilde Tillet, the second was Heathcote&rsquo;s  sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hilda!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Hilda stood before him in silence, with drooping  head, pale with surprise and embarrassment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody told you I was here,&rdquo; she faltered at  last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me,&rdquo; he answered, smiling at her  confusion. &ldquo;I have not even been looking for you, or making inquiries as to  your whereabouts. Your letter was so very self-assertive, you seemed so  completely mistress of the situation, that I felt it would be folly to  interfere with you. As I opposed you when you wanted to marry Bothwell Grahame,  it would be very inconsistent of me to oppose your renunciation of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda gave a faint sigh. This speech of her  brother&rsquo;s was reassuring, but it implied discredit to Bothwell. She would fain  have stood up for her true knight, would fain have praised him whom she had  forsaken; but she felt it was safer to hold her peace. By and by, when her  sacrifice was completed, and when Bothwell Grahame was Lady Valeria&rsquo;s husband,  she could afford to defend his character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear child, our meeting is quite  accidental. I came here to see Monsieur Tillet&rsquo;s drawings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our young friend is known to you, Monsieur?&rdquo;  inquired Eug&egrave;ne Tillet, who had looked on with some appearance of interest at a  conversation of which he did not understand a word.</p>
<p>This Mr. Heathcote was evidently Hilda&rsquo;s brother,  of whom Mdlle. Duprez had spoken before she introduced her <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</em> to the family circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your young friend is my sister, Monsieur,&rdquo;  answered Heathcote; &ldquo;and since she was determined to run away from home, I am  glad she fell into such good hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you have found her you are going to carry  her off, I suppose,&rdquo; said Tillet. &ldquo;It will be a pity, for I hear that her  talents have made a strong impression upon one of the cleverest professors at  the Conservatoire, and that she may do great things with her voice if she  pursue her studies there. My young people will be in despair at losing her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They shall not lose her quite immediately,&rdquo;  replied Heathcote, &ldquo;though if she is bent upon studying at the Conservatoire, I  think it would be better for her to have her old governess to look after her in  Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fr&auml;ulein Meyerstein!&rdquo; exclaimed Hilda. &ldquo;She would  worry me out of my life. She would talk about &mdash; about &mdash; the past.&rdquo; She could  not bring herself to mention Bothwell&rsquo;s name just yet. &ldquo;My only chance of ever  being happy again is to forget my old life. There is some possibility of that  here, among new faces and new surroundings. And they are all so kind to me here  &mdash; Madame Tillet is like a mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this was said hurriedly in English, while  Monsieur Tillet discreetly occupied himself putting away his sketch-books.  Mathilde had withdrawn, and was telling her mother about the unpleasant  surprise that had greeted her return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you come to know these people?&rdquo; asked  Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mdlle. Duprez brought me here. She has known the  Tillets all her life. She will answer to you for their respectability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will think about it. Let me look at you,  Hilda. You are not very blooming, my poor child. It does not seem to me that  Paris agrees with you over well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paris agrees with me quite as well as any other  place,&rdquo; she answered quietly.</p>
<p>He took her hand and led her to the window, and  looked thoughtfully into the sad, pale face, with its expression of settled  pain. Yes, he knew what that look meant; he had experienced that dull, slow  agony of an aching heart. She had surrendered all that was dearest in life, and  she must live through the aching sense of loss, live on to days of dull  contentment with a sunless lot. He who himself had never learned the lesson of  forgetfulness was not inclined to think lightly of his sister&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look very unhappy, Hilda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I begin  to question the wisdom of your conduct. Do you believe that Bothwell really  cared more for this audacious widow than for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had been devoted to her for years,&rdquo; answered  Hilda. &ldquo;I saw his letters; I saw the evidence of his love under his own hand.  He wrote to her as he never wrote to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was younger in those days,&rdquo; argued Heathcote. &ldquo;Youngsters  are fond of big words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that first love must be the truest. I  never cared for any one till I saw Bothwell; and I know that my first love will  be my last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;I hope you have  acted wisely in your prompt renunciation. There were reasons why I did not care  for the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You surely have left off suspecting him,&rdquo; said  Hilda, with an indignant look. &ldquo;You are not mad enough to think that he was  concerned in that girl&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Hilda, that suspicion is a thing of the past.  And now let us talk seriously. You have set your heart upon pursuing your  studies at the Conservatoire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my only object in life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you would like to remain in this family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much. They are the cleverest, nicest people I  ever knew &mdash; with the exception of my nearest and dearest, you and Dora &mdash; and  Bothwell. They are all as kind to me as if I were a daughter of the house. The  life suits me exactly. I should like to stay here for a twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a categorical answer,&rdquo; said Heathcote,  &ldquo;and leaves me no alternative. I will make a few inquiries about Monsieur  Tillet and his surroundings, and if the replies are satisfactory you shall stay  here. But I shall send Glossop over to look after you and your frocks. It is  not right that my sister should be without a personal attendant of some kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Glossop. If she comes here, she will  write to her friends in Cornwall and tell them where I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she won&rsquo;t. She will have my instructions  before she leaves The Spaniards. She shall send all her Cornish letters through  me. And now good-bye. It is just possible that I may not see you again before I  leave Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to leave Paris soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suppose you have found out all you want to  know about that poor girl who was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have found out all I want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God! It was so terrible to think there were  people living who could suspect Bothwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is horrible to think there was any man base  enough to murder that helpless girl &mdash; a man so steeped in hypocrisy that he  could defy suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know who committed the murder?&rdquo; inquired  Hilda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can answer no more questions. You will learn all  in time. The difficulty will be to forget the hideous story when you have once  heard it. Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were alone in the Tillet <em>salon</em>, Monsieur Tillet having retired while they were talking. He  reappeared on the landing outside to hand Mr. Heathcote the parcel of sketches,  and to make his respectful adieux to that discerning amateur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur your brother is the most accomplished  Englishman I ever met,&rdquo; said the painter to Hilda, when his visitor had  disappeared in the obscurity of the staircase.</p>
<p>He patted his waistcoat-pocket as he spoke. The  sensation of having bank-notes there was altogether new. He had been fed upon  the fat of the land by his devoted wife; he had been provided with petty cash  by his dutiful children; but to touch a lump sum, the price of his own work,  seemed the renewal of youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the curious name of that picture  of Landseer&rsquo;s, <em>ma chatte</em>?&rdquo; he said,  chucking his wife under the chin when she came bustling in from her housewifely  errands. &ldquo;&lsquo;Zair is lif in ze all dogue yet.&rsquo; Zair is lif in ze all dogue, <em>que voici</em>. See here, I have been earning  money while you have been <em>fl&acirc;nochant</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed her the corner of the little sheaf of  notes, coquettishly. She held out her hand, expecting to be intrusted with the  treasure; but he shook his head gently, smiling a tender smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, <em>mon  enfant</em>, we will not trifle with this windfall,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We will treat it  seriously; it shall be the nucleus of our future fortune, <em>j&rsquo;ach&egrave;terai des rentes</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears welled up to the wife&rsquo;s honest eyes,  tears not of gratitude, but of mortification. She knew this husband of hers  well enough to be very sure that every <em>sous</em> in those bank-notes would have dribbled out of the painter&rsquo;s pockets in a few  weeks; and that no one, least of all the squanderer himself, would know how it  had been spent, or in what respect he was the better for its expenditure.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter30"></a>Chapter 30<br>
  Waiting For His Doom</h2>
<p>Life for Dora Wyllard was more than ever melancholy  after Hilda&rsquo;s disappearance. The girl&rsquo;s companionship had been her only ray of  sunshine during this time of sorrow and anxiety. In her sympathy with Hilda&rsquo;s  joys and hopes she had been able to withdraw herself now and then from the  contemplation of her own misery. Now this distraction was gone, and she was  alone with her grief.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard had shown much greater anger at  Hilda&rsquo;s conduct than his wife had anticipated. He had taken the lovers under  his protection, he had been curiously eager for their marriage, had talked of  it, and had hurried it on with an almost feverish impatience. And now he would  not hear of any excuse for Hilda&rsquo;s conduct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has acted like a madwoman,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When  everything had been arranged to secure her future happiness with Bothwell, her  devoted slave, she allows herself to be driven away by the audacity of a  brazen-faced coquette. I have no patience with her. But if Bothwell has any brains,  he ought to be able to find her in a week, and bring her to her senses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Bothwell may not care about running after  her,&rdquo; speculated Dora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O, a man who is over head and ears in love will  endure any outrage. He is a slavish creature, and the more he is trampled upon  the better he loves his tyrant. It remains to be seen which of the two women  Bothwell would rather marry &mdash; Hilda, with her rustic simplicity, or the widow,  with her slightly damaged reputation and very handsome income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does not waver for a moment between them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that is all you know; but if he does not give  chase to Hilda, you may be sure it is because in his heart of hearts he hankers  after the widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell had gone back to Trevena, intending to pay  the builders for the work they had done, and suspend the carrying out of the  contract indefinitely.</p>
<p>He would have to give them some compensation, no  doubt, for delay; but they were good, honest, rustic fellows, and he was not  afraid of being severely mulcted.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard spoke of Bothwell and his love  affairs with the irritability of a chronic sufferer, and Dora listened and  sympathised, and soothed the sufferer as best she might. Her burden was very  heavy in these days. To see her beloved suffer and to be unable to lessen his  pain, that was indeed bitter. And in his case the palliating drugs which  deadened his agony seemed almost a worse evil than the pain itself. The  constant use of morphia and chloral was working its pernicious effect, and  there were times, when the sufferer&rsquo;s mind wandered. There were dreams which  seemed more agonising than wakeful hours of pain. Dora sat beside her husband&rsquo;s  couch and watched him as he slept under the influence of morphia. She listened  to his dull mutterings, in French for the most part. He rarely spoke any other  language in that troubled state of the brain between dreaming and delirium. It  was evident to her that his mind, in these intervals of wandering, habitually  harked back to the days of his residence in Paris, ten years ago. And his  hallucinations at this time seemed always of a ghastly character. The scenes he  looked upon were steeped in blood, doubtless a reminiscence of those hideous  days of the Commune, when Paris was given over to fire and carnage. She  shuddered as she saw the look of horror in his widely-opened yet sightless eyes  &mdash; sightless for reality, but seeing strange visions &mdash; shapes of dread. She  shuddered at the wild cry which broke from those white lips, the infinite pain  in the lines of the forehead, damp with the cold dews of anguish.</p>
<p>In his waking hours, when free from the influence  of chloral, the sufferer&rsquo;s brain was as clear as ever; but the irritation of  his nerves was intense. A sound, the slightest, agitated him. A footstep in the  corridor, a ring at the hall-door, startled him as if it had been a  thunder-clap. His senses seemed always on the alert. There was no middle state  between that intense activity of brain and the coma or semi-delirium which  resulted from opiates.</p>
<p>Sir William Spencer had been down to Penmorval  twice since the invalid&rsquo;s return, but his opinion had not been hopeful on  either occasion. On the second time of his coming he had seen a marked change  for the worse. The malady had made terrible progress in a short interval. And  now, on this dull gray autumn afternoon, within twenty-four hours of  Heathcote&rsquo;s visit to the Rue du Bac, the famous physician came to Penmorval for  the third time, and again could only bear witness to the progress of evil.</p>
<p>Wyllard insisted upon being alone with his physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir William, I want you to tell me the truth about  my case: the unsophisticated truth. There will be no end gained by your  withholding it; for I have read up the history of this disease of mine, and I  know pretty well what I have to expect. A gradual extinction, disfigurement and  distortion of every limb and every feature, beginning with this withered,  claw-shaped hand, and creeping on and on, till I lie like an idiot, sightless,  speechless, tasteless, with lolling tongue dribbling upon my pillow. And throughout  this dissolution of the body I may yet, if specially privileged, retain the  faculties of my mind. I may be to the last conscious of all that I have been  and all that I am. There is the redeeming feature. I shall perish molecule by  molecule, feeling my own death, able to appreciate every change, every stage in  the inevitable progress of corruption. That lingering process of annihilation  which other men suffer unconsciously underground I shall suffer consciously  above ground. That is the history of my case, I take it, Sir William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There have been such cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and mine is one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not say that. The fatal cases are certainly  in the majority; but there have been cures. Whatever medicine can do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will be done for me. Yes, I know that. But the  utmost you have been able to do so far has been to deaden pain, and that at the  cost of some of the most diabolical dreams that ever man dreamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope for the best, Mr. Wyllard,&rdquo; replied  the great physician, with that grave and kindly tone which had brought comfort  to so many doomed sufferers, the indescribable comfort which a sympathetic  nature can always impart. &ldquo;As your adviser, it is my duty to tell you that it  would be well your house were set in order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All has been done. I made my will after my  marriage. It gives all to my wife. She will deal with my fortune as the  incarnate spirit of justice and benevolence. I have supreme confidence in her  wisdom and in her goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well. Then there is no more to be said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the physician was being driven  back to the station, and Julian Wyllard was alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And Swift expires a driveller and a show,&rsquo;&rdquo; he  repeated, in a tone of suppressed agony. &ldquo;Yes, that is the horror. To become a  spectacle &mdash; a loathsome object from which even love would shrink away with  averted eyes. That is the sting. Facial an&aelig;sthesia &mdash; every muscle paralysed,  every feature distorted. O, for the doomsman to make a shorter end of it all!  The face has been spared so far &mdash; speech has hardly begun to falter. But it is  coming &mdash; it is coming. I found myself forgetting common words this morning when  I was talking to Dora. I caught myself babbling like a child that is just  beginning to speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took up a hand-mirror which he had asked his  wife to leave near him, and contemplated himself thoughtfully for some moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is no change yet in the face, except a  livid hue, like a corpse alive. The features are still in their right places,  the mouth not yet drawn to one side; the eyelids still firm. But each stage of  decay will follow in its course. And to know all the time that there is an  easier way out of it, if one could but take it, just at the right moment,  without being too much of a craven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced at the table by his sofa, a capacious  table, holding his books, his reading-lamp, and his dressing-case with its  elaborate appliances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did not want to know the issue of Heathcote&rsquo;s  inquiries! If &mdash; O, for some blow from the sledgehammer of Destiny, that would  put an end to all irresolution, take my fate out of my own hands! A blow that  would annihilate me, and yet spare her &mdash; if that could be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A loud ringing at the hall-door sounded like an  answer to an invocation. Julian Wyllard lifted his head a little way from the  silken-covered pillows, and turned his haggard eyes towards the door leading  into the corridor.</p>
<p>After an interval of some moments there came the  sounds of footsteps, the door was opened, and the servant announced,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Heathcote.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote stood near the threshold, hat in hand,  deadly pale, grave to solemnity, mute as death itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come back, Heathcote?&rdquo; asked the invalid,  with an off-hand air. &ldquo;Then I conclude you have accomplished your mission, or  reconciled yourself to failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have succeeded in my mission beyond my hopes,&rdquo;  answered Heathcote. &ldquo;But my success is as terrible to myself as it must needs  be to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed! Does that mean that you have solved the  mystery of the French girl&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means as much, and more than that. It means,  Julian Wyllard, that I have solved the mystery of <em>your life</em> &mdash; that double life which showed to the world the  character of a hard-headed financier, passionless, mechanical, while the real  nature of the man, passionate, jealous, vindictive, the lover and the slave of  a beautiful woman, was known to but a few chosen friends. It means that slowly,  patiently, link by link, detail after detail, I have put together the history  of your life in Paris &mdash; the secret door by which the financier left his lonely  office at nightfall, to drink the cup of pleasure with his mistress &mdash; or his  wife &mdash; and his boon companions. By the inevitable sequence of small facts, by  the agreement of dates, by a pencil sketch of the murderer&rsquo;s face, made from  memory, yet vivid as flesh and blood, I have been able to identify you, Julian  Wyllard, with the man who called himself Georges, who was known to a few  privileged Bohemians as the lover of Marie Pr&eacute;vol, and who disappeared from  Paris immediately after the murder, so completely as to baffle the police. The  murderer vanished utterly, before the crime was twelve hours old; yet he was  known to have visited the grave of his victim up to March &rsquo;74 &mdash; the exact  period at which you, Julian Wyllard, left Paris for ever. It means that in you,  the man who came between me and the happiness of my life, who stole my  betrothed &mdash; in you, the successful speculator, the honoured of all men, I have  found the murderer of L&eacute;onie Lemarque and of her aunt Marie Pr&eacute;vol, and of her  aunt&rsquo;s admirer, Maxime de Maucroix. A man must have a mind and heart of iron  who could carry the consciousness of three such murders with a calm front; who  could clasp his innocent wife to his breast, accept her caresses, her devotion,  her revering love &mdash; knowing himself the relentless devil that he is! Julian Wyllard,  thou art the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am!&rdquo; answered the white lips resolutely, while  the haggard eyes flashed defiance. &ldquo;I am that man. I have obeyed my destiny,  which was to love with a desperate love, and hate with a desperate hate. I have  gratified my love and my hatred. I have lived, Heathcote; lived as men of your  stamp know not how to live; lived with every drop of blood in my veins, with  every beat of my heart: and now I am content to rot in a dishonoured grave, the  abhorred of pettier sinners!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wail &mdash; a cry of agony from a despairing woman &mdash;  sounded in the utterance of that name.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter31"></a>Chapter 31<br>
  &ldquo;Alike Is Hell, Or Paradise, Or Heaven&rdquo;</h2>
<p>It was the despairing cry of a woman&rsquo;s breaking  heart that came with that low wailing sound from the curtained doorway. Dora  had been told of Heathcote&rsquo;s arrival, and had hurried from her dressing-room on  the further side of the bedchamber. She had reached the threshold of the  morning-room in time to hear Heathcote pronounce the dreadful word &ldquo;Murder,&rdquo;  and she had heard all that followed. She had heard her husband&rsquo;s proclaim  himself triply an assassin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my wife&rsquo;s voice,&rdquo; said Wyllard quietly. &ldquo;You  knew that she was there, perhaps. You wanted her to hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know she was there; but it would have  been my duty to tell her all I have discovered. She has lived under a delusion;  she has lived under the spell of your consummate hypocrisy. It is only right  that she should know the truth. Thank God, she has heard it from your own  lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not forgotten the day when we were rivals  for her love,&rdquo; said Wyllard, with a diabolical sneer. &ldquo;I won the race, heavily  handicapped; and now your turn has come. You have your revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote was silent. His eyes were fixed upon the  figure which appeared against the glowing darkness of the plush curtain, and  came slowly, totteringly forward to Wyllard&rsquo;s couch, and sank in a heap beside  it. The white, set face, with its look of agony, the widely-opened eyes, pale  with horror, haunted him for long after that awful hour. It was he who had  brought this agony upon her, he who had unearthed the buried skeleton, he who,  going forth from that house to do her bidding, her true knight, her champion,  her servant, had come back as the messenger of doom. Was he to blame that Fate  had imposed this hateful task upon him? He told himself that he was blameless;  but that she would never forgive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I congratulate you upon your perseverance and your  success,&rdquo; said Wyllard, after a pause. &ldquo;You have succeeded where all the police  of Paris had failed. Was it love for my wife, or hatred for me, that stood in  the place of training and experience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was neither. It was the hand of Fate, the  mysterious guiding of Providence, which took me from stage to stage of that  horrible story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it was my wife &mdash; my redeeming angel &mdash; who sent  you forth upon your mission, who appealed to your love of the past as a claim  on your devotion in the present. There is the irony of Fate in that part of the  business,&rdquo; said Wyllard mockingly.</p>
<p>He had always hated Edward Heathcote; he had hated  him even in the hour of his own triumph as Dora&rsquo;s accepted lover; hated him  because he had once possessed Dora&rsquo;s love, but most of all because he had been  worthy of it.</p>
<p>Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s head leaned forward upon his  folded arms, and for some minutes there was silence in the room, save for the  sound of suppressed sobbing from that kneeling figure by the sick man&rsquo;s couch.  The face of the husband and the face of the wife were alike hidden. Dora&rsquo;s head  had fallen across her husband&rsquo;s knees, her hands were clasped above the dark  coils of her hair, in the self-abandonment of her agony.</p>
<p>Heathcote stood a little way off, feeling as if he  were in the presence of the dead. The mystery of those two hidden faces  oppressed him. He almost hated himself for this thing which he had done. He  felt like an executioner &mdash; a man from whom the stern necessity of his craft had  exacted a revolting service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, is this true?&rdquo; murmured Dora, after a long  silence. &ldquo;Is all or any part of this dreadful story true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband looked up suddenly, as if vivified by  the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you think of me if it were all or any  of it true?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;Look up, Dora. Let me see your eyes as you  answer me. I want to know how I am to stand henceforth in the sight of the  woman who once loved me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted her head, and turned her deathlike face  towards him, tearless, but with a look of anguish deeper than he had ever seen  before on any human countenance.</p>
<p>That other look, that last look of L&eacute;onie Lemarque&rsquo;s,  which had haunted him waking or sleeping ever since the 5th of July, had been a  look of horrified surprise. But here there was the quiet anguish of a broken  heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who once loved you,&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Do you think  such love as mine can be thrown off like an old gown? Tell me the truth, Julian  &mdash; it can make no difference to my love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wyllard remained for some moments gazing dreamily  at the low wood fire opposite his couch, silent, as if looking into the pages  of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your story is put together very cleverly,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;and it is for the most part true. Yes, I am the murderer of Marie  Pr&eacute;vol. I am that jealous devil, who in an access of fury destroyed the life  that was dearer than his own. It was not that I believed her guilty. No, it was  the agonising knowledge that her love had gone from me, in spite of herself &mdash;  had gone to that younger, brighter, more fascinating lover. I saw the gradual  working of the change &mdash; saw coldness, dislike even, creeping over her who had  once tenderly rewarded my love &mdash; saw that my coming was unwelcome, my departure  a relief. She, who of old had followed me to the threshold, had hung upon me  with sweetest caresses at the moment of parting, now could scarcely conceal her  indifference, her growing aversion. I saw all this, and Satan took hold of me.  Again and again I was on the verge of unpremeditated murder. My eyes grew dim,  veiled by a cloud of blood; but I held my hand before the deed was done. I have  had my grip upon her throat &mdash; that milk-white throat, which was purer of tint  and lovelier of form than that of the Louvre Venus. I have seen the pleading  eyes looking into mine, asking me for mercy, and I have fallen at her feet and  sobbed like a child. But there came a time when this sullen devil of jealousy  and hatred took a firmer hold of me, and then I swore to myself that they  should both die. There was no help, no other cure. If she lived, she would  leave me for Maucroix. She, the wife I had honoured, would sink into the  mistress of a fop and a fribble, to be cast off when his fancy staled. I knew  that was inevitable, so I made up my mind, all of a sudden, when I got wind of  her intended jaunt to Saint-Germain, from the spy I had employed to watch her.  I put my revolver in my pocket, and followed her to the station, disguised by a  pair of dark spectacles and a style of dress in which she had never seen me. I  stood by the doorway of the waiting-room, and saw her sitting side by side with  her favoured lover, they two as happy and as absorbed in each other as children  at play in a garden. You know all the rest. Yes, it was I who watched in front  of the Henri Quatre, saw those two laughing together in the candle-light: it  was I who sprang out of the thicket in the forest and shot them down, one after  the other, left them lying there side by side, dead. I had a strange wild  feeling of happiness as I rushed away into the depths of the wood &mdash; a sense of  triumph. I had won my love from her new lover. She had been mine only; and she  would be mine now until the end. I had saved her from her own weakness &mdash; saved,  her from the dishonour which her folly must have made inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused for a few moments, but neither Dora nor  Heathcote spoke, and after the briefest silence he went on with his confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant to survive my victims, except just  so long as would be necessary to put my affairs in order, and to transfer my  securities to England, where those of my own flesh and blood might profit by my  fortune. In order to do this I got quietly back to Paris, and began to take up  the threads of my business life with a view to closing the book for ever. You  know enough of my character and my history to understand that I have always had  perfect command over my emotions, and you will therefore believe that I was  able to go about my daily business, to mix with my fellow-men, with as serene a  manner and countenance as if not a ripple of passion had crossed the stagnant  surface of my plodding nature. I had so trained myself that the man of passion  and emotions was one being, and the man of business another, a creature totally  apart. And now, for a while at least, the man of feeling was dead and buried,  and only the money-making automaton remained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It happened at that time that a cloud of disaster  swept over the Paris Bourse. Had I wound up my affairs at that period, I should  have been a heavy loser; and I, to whom the science of finance was a passion,  could not submit to losses which I knew how to avoid. So I delayed the  settlement of my affairs, and even allowed myself to be tempted into fresh  enterprises. Yet scarcely a night passed on which I did not look at my pistols  before I lay down to rest, and long for the time when I should feel myself free  to end my miserable life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in those days you went frequently to the  cemetery, to place your tribute of roses on your victim&rsquo;s grave,&rdquo; said  Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the only mark of affection I could show to  the woman my love had killed,&rdquo; answered Wyllard; &ldquo;the only token of respect for  my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your wife?&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Then Barbe Girot  was right in her supposition. You loved Marie Pr&eacute;vol well enough to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I loved her too well to degrade her,&rdquo; answered  Wyllard. &ldquo;It was in the flood-tide of my financial success, when I was almost  drunk with fortune, and had not one thought above money-making, that Marie  Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s face awakened me to a new life. That lovely face &mdash; so like yours, Dora  &mdash; yes, it was the likeness to my good angel of the past that drew me to you, my  good angel of the present, my comforter, my better-self. O, but for that second  unpremeditated crime, the evil work of a moment&rsquo;s savage passion, I might have  gone down to the grave in peace, believing that I had expiated that first  murder, atoned for that double bloodshed by the agonies that had gone before  and after it. But that last crime wrecked me. It revealed the blackness of my  diabolical nature &mdash; a nature in which the evil is inherent, the good only the  effect of education and surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was my wife, and I gave her all honour  and reverence due to a wife: though it was my caprice, my false pride perhaps,  to keep my relations with her a profound secret. I had won my reputation in  Paris as the stolid, unemotional Englishman; a man of iron, a creature without  passions or human weaknesses, a calculating machine. It was this reputation  which had helped most of all to bring me wealth. To be known all at once as the  lover and the husband of a beautiful actress would have been social, and might  have been financial, ruin. The men who had trusted me with their money to stake  on the speculator&rsquo;s wheel of fortune would have withdrawn their confidence. I  should have been left to fight single-handed on my own capital, and my own  capital, large as it was by this time, was not large enough for my schemes. The  Cr&eacute;dit Mauresque was then in the front rank of public favour, and it was  generally considered that I was the Cr&eacute;dit Mauresque. Any weakness on my part  and the bubble would have burst. So I planned for myself a dual existence. By  day I was the cool-headed financier; but when the stars were high and the lamps  lighted I was Georges, the American-Parisian, the Eccentric and Bohemian &mdash; the  friend and entertainer of a little band of choice spirits, journalists,  musicians, painters &mdash; the lover, husband, slave of Marie Pr&eacute;vol. Ah, Dora, for  the first two years of that midnight life there was compensation in it for all  the restraints of the day, for the anxiety, the fever, the fret of a  speculator&rsquo;s hazardous career.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, she was my wife. I married her in a village  church in the Lake country; a quiet little church half hidden among the hills  which encircle Derwentwater &mdash; a sweet spot. Do you remember once asking me to  take you to the English Lakes, Dora? I had to invent an excuse for refusing. I  could not revisit those scenes, even with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was silence, broken only by the sound  of Dora&rsquo;s weeping. She was still on her knees beside her husband&rsquo;s couch; her  hand still clasped his. Not all the horror that had been revealed to her could  change her love to hate or scorn. Deepest pity filled her breast. She, to whose  nature deeds of violence were altogether alien, could yet enter into and  sympathise with the feelings of this sinner, whose fatal passions had sunk him  in an abyss of crime. She pitied him, and clung to him, ready with words of  comfort whenever such words might be spoken. Even in her silence the very touch  of her hand told of consolation and of pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I married my love in that quiet village church &mdash;  married her under my assumed name of Gustave Georges; but the marriage was  sound enough in law, and for me it meant a life-long bond. I had found Marie  Pr&eacute;vol pure and innocent in the tainted atmosphere of a Parisian theatre, a  creature incapable of guile. I honoured her for that innate purity which was  independent of surroundings and circumstances, which had passed unscathed  through the fiery-furnace of Bohemian Paris. The first years of our wedded life  were full of happiness, steeped in a love which knew no change or diminution.  My darling seemed to me, day by day, more adorable, and it may be that the  secrecy of my double life, the long hours of severance, the narrow circle in  which Marie and I lived when we were together &mdash; it may be that these  circumstances, and the strangeness of our relations, intensified my passion,  lending to our wedded bliss all the charm of mystery and romance. Ah, how sweet  were our brief holidays at Biarritz or Pau, our wanderings in picturesque old  Spain, far away from the beaten tracks, choosing mostly those places to which  the world did not go! So far as it went, that life of ours was a perfect life;  and I was fool enough to think that it would last for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed, and sank for some moments into a dreamy  silence, his eyes fixed in a vision of that past existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife had an intense delight in the theatre, and  her successes there. She was never a famous actress; but her beauty had made  her the rage. She had a birdlike soprano voice, and a bewitching manner. She  was one of those adorable actresses who enchant their audience without ever  losing their own individuality. She was always Marie Pr&eacute;vol; but the public  wanted her to be nothing else. As I kept her entirely secluded from society for  my own reasons, I could not deny her the pleasure of pursuing her profession.  It pleased her to earn a handsome salary, to know that she was not entirely  dependent on me, to be able to help her mother, who was a harpy, continually  taking money from me. So she remained on the stage, to my destruction; for it  was there that Maucroix saw her; and it was because she was an actress that he  dared to pursue her with attentions which she at first repulsed, but which she  afterwards encouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dora, I will not dwell upon that hideous time,  those days and nights of madness and despair. I saw her love going from me. I  saw the subtle change from affection to indifference, from indifference to  fear, from fear to disgust, and then to horror. She was kind to me still, from  a sense of duty, meek, obedient, a gentle yielding wife. But I saw her shiver  at my approach; I felt her hand grow cold in mine; I found repulsion instead of  warm confiding love. Nor was I allowed long to remain in ignorance as to the  cause of the change. A kind friend of mine was also an acquaintance of  Maucroix. He informed me of the young man&rsquo;s passion for Marie, of his having  sworn to win her at any cost &mdash; yes, even at the cost of the coronet which he  had the power to bestow upon her. He was independent, rich, able to do as he  liked with his life. He was one of the handsomest young men in Paris, and was  said to be the most fascinating. And I was a hard-headed man of business,  anxious, brain-weary, long past the flush of hopeful youth. Could I wonder that  Marie turned from me to her young adorer? I gave her all credit for having struggled  against her infatuation, for having been true to her duty as a wife even to the  last; but she had ceased to love me, and the day was at hand when the barriers  would be broken, when that impassioned woman&rsquo;s heart of hers, that fond  impulsive nature, whose every pulse I knew, would yield at a breath, and she  whom I worshipped would fall to blackest depths of sin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, like Othello, I called this deed which I had  to do, a sacrifice, and not a murder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard the story of my crime from the lips  of your friend here. He has unravelled the tangled skein with a wonderful  ingenuity. Yes, it was I who laid those roses on my victim&rsquo;s grave. I stayed in  Paris long enough to save appearances, the man Georges being supposed to have  fled to the utmost ends of the earth. I went about among my fellow-men on the  Bourse and in the clubs, and heard them discuss the murder of Marie Pr&eacute;vol.  Once I was told, by a man who had met me as Georges, of my likeness to the  supposed murderer; but those few chosen friends who had known me as Georges  were not men to be met on the Bourse or in financial circles, and I had always  eschewed mixed society. My identity with the murderer was never suspected. I  saved my fortune, wound up my affairs, and left Paris, as I thought for ever,  went forth from that accursed city as I would have gone out of hell. I came  back to England with the brand of Cain, not upon my brow, but upon my heart. I  wandered in a purposeless fashion from place to place, possessed of a restless  devil. I had my office in London, where I tried to find a distraction in the  excitement of speculation, the financial strategy which had once been my  delight. Vain the effort. I was no happier in London than I had been in Paris,  within a few minutes walk of the house that had sheltered my wife, the secret  home in which I had been so happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haunted always by the same dark thoughts, seeing  only one image amidst every change of surroundings, I came at last to this  fag-end of England. The rugged scenery, the wild coast-line, the sparsely  populated moors and fells pleased me better than anything I had seen on this  side of the Channel. The landscape harmonised with my melancholy thoughts, and  exercised a soothing influence upon my mind. I became more reconciled to my  life. Conscience, as you, Dora, or you, Heathcote, may accept the word, had  troubled me but little. I had exercised what I held to be my right &mdash; my right  to slay the woman who had broken my heart, the man who had spoiled my life. I  was oppressed by no particular horror at the thought of blood-guiltiness. The  agony from which I suffered was the loss of Marie&rsquo;s love, the loss of the woman  who had once filled my life with happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I took kindly to your native soil, Dora. It might  be a foreshadowing of the love which was to gladden my latter days. My mind  grew clearer, the burden seemed to be lifted from me. And then in a happy hour  I met <em>you</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that first meeting, Dora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember,&rdquo; she said softly, her head  drooping upon her husband&rsquo;s pillow, her face hidden, an attitude of mourning,  like a marble figure bending over a funeral urn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in the picture-gallery at Tregony Manor. I  had been taken there as a stranger by the Rector of the parish, to see a famous  Wouvermans. Your mother received me in the friendliest spirit; and while we  were talking about her pictures you appeared at the other end of the gallery, a  girlish figure in a white gown, carrying your garden-hat in your hand,  surprised at seeing a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember how you started, how oddly you looked  at me,&rdquo; murmured his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was looking at a face out of the grave &mdash; the  face of Marie Pr&eacute;vol; younger, fresher, but not more innocent in its stainless  beauty than Marie&rsquo;s face when I first knew her. The likeness is but a vague  one, perhaps &mdash; a look, an air; but to me at that moment it struck home. My  heart went out to you at once. If my murdered wife had come back to me in some  angelic form, had offered me peace, and pardon, and the renewal of love, I  could not have surrendered myself more completely to that superhuman bliss than  I surrendered myself to you. I loved you from the first, and swore to myself  that you should be mine. I do not think I used any dishonourable arts in order  to win you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew that she was the betrothed of another man,  knew that your hands were stained with blood,&rdquo; said Heathcote, with suppressed  indignation. &ldquo;Was there no dishonour in tempting a pure-minded girl with your  love? You, whose heart must be as a charnel-house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had put every thought of that dark past behind  me before I entered Tregony Manor. Was I a different man, do you think, because  in one dark hour of my life I had sinned against the law of civilised society,  and revenged my own wrongs according to the universal law of unsophisticated  mankind? I loved my new love not the less dearly because of that crime. I loved  her as women are not often loved. Dora, speak to me; tell me if I have ever  failed in any duty which a husband owes to an idolised wife. Have I ever been  false to the promises of our betrothal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never; never, my beloved,&rdquo; murmured the low  mournful voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have lived happily to the end, perhaps,  had Fate been kinder. I had my dark dreams now and again, acted over my past  crime, my old agonies, in the helplessness of slumber; but this was only a  transient evil. My darling&rsquo;s influence could always soothe and restore me, even  in the darkest hour. All went well with me &mdash; better, perhaps, than life goes  with many a better man &mdash; until the fatal hour when I received a letter from  Marie Pr&eacute;vol&rsquo;s mother, written on her death-bed, asking me to find a home in  England for her orphan granddaughter, the child I had heard of in the Rue  Lafitte, and who had occasionally stayed there as Marie&rsquo;s pet and plaything,  but whom I had avoided at all times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I answered the letter promptly, in my character of  a friend of the missing Georges. It was in this character that I had contrived  from time to time to send money for the relief of Madame Lemarque&rsquo;s  necessities. I sent money to bring the girl to London, and arranged to meet her  at the railway-station. That was when I went ostensibly to buy the famous  Raffaelle, Dora. I was somewhat uncertain as to my plans for the girl&rsquo;s future;  but I meant kindly by her; I had no thought but of being kind to her. If she should  prove an amiable girl, with pleasing manners, my idea was to bring her to this  neighbourhood, to get her placed as a nursery governess somewhere within my  ken, to introduce her to you, and to secure your kindness and protection for  her. I had paid for her education at a convent in Brittany; and I had been  assured that she left the convent with an excellent character. She was the only  link remaining with the terrible past, the only witness of my crime; but I had  been told that after her illness all memory of that crime had left her. I had  been assured that I should run no risk in having her about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; said Dora, with a stifled sob,  recalling that summer evening when Julian Wyllard came out of the station, a  little paler than usual, but self-possessed and calm, telling her in measured  tones of the calamity upon the line &mdash; the strange death of a nameless girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met her at Charing Cross in the early summer  morning,&rdquo; he continued quietly. &ldquo;She was flurried and frightened &mdash; so  frightened by the strange faces and the strange language round about her, that  she forgot to tell me of the bag she had deposited in the waiting-room. But I  succeeded in putting her at her ease; and while she was taking breakfast with  me in a private room at the hotel, she told me all about her grandmother&rsquo;s  death, and her own education in the convent; what she could do in the way of  teaching. She was frank and gentle, and seemed a good girl, and I had no  thought but to do the utmost for her advantage. I could have pensioned her and  made her independent of all service; but I considered that for a friendless  girl there could be no better discipline than the necessity of earning a living  under reputable circumstances, and protected by powerful friends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We drove together to Paddington &mdash; as your cabman  informed you,&rdquo; continued Wyllard, addressing himself for an instant to  Heathcote, whom he for the most part ignored. &ldquo;At Paddington I took a  second-class ticket for Plymouth, not quite resolved as to whether I should  take the girl on at once to Bodmin, or leave her in the care of the wife of my  frame-maker at Plymouth, an honest creature, who would, I knew, be faithful to  any trust I reposed in her. I put my <em>prot&eacute;g&eacute;e</em> in a second-class carriage, in the care of some friendly people, and I rode  alone in a first-class compartment. I wanted to be free to think out the  situation, to decide on my line of conduct. I knew that she had a packet of my  letters &mdash; my early letters to Marie Pr&eacute;vol, written without reserve, out of the  fulness of my heart &mdash; letters identifying me with the man Georges. It was vital  that I should get these letters from her before she left the railway-carriage.  Yet, with a curious weakness, I delayed making the attempt till we came to  Plymouth. There would be fewer people in the carriages then, I thought. It  would be easier for me to be alone with L&eacute;onie. I had by this time decided upon  taking her on to Bodmin, and finding her a temporary home in my steward&rsquo;s  family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Plymouth I left my own compartment, intending  to go straight to the second-class carriage in which I had placed L&eacute;onie: but  on the platform I was met by people I knew, who detained me in conversation  till the train was within two minutes of starting. While I was talking to these  people I saw L&eacute;onie wandering up and down the platform in an aimless way,  perhaps looking for me. I had told her that I would let her know when she had  come to the end of her journey, and now she was mystified by the delay, and  feared that I had forgotten her. About one minute before the starting of the  train I escaped from my troublesome friends, and got into an empty  second-class, into which I beckoned L&eacute;onie as she came along the platform.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We crossed the bridge and came into Cornwall; and  now there was but the shortest time for me to explain my views as to the girl&rsquo;s  future, and to get from her those fatal letters, which told the history of my  love for Marie Pr&eacute;vol, my double life as her husband, and which, by the  evidence of my own handwriting, identified me with her murderer. I was  determined that L&eacute;onie should not leave the train with that packet in her  possession, but I anticipated no difficulty in getting it from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told her my views, promised her that I would be  to her as a guardian and friend, so long as she should deserve my protection,  assured her that the happiness and prosperity of her future life were  contingent only on her good conduct. And then I asked her for the packet which  Madame Lemarque had told her to deliver to me. But to my astonishment she  refused to give it to me. Her grandmother had told her that she was never to  part with those letters. She was to keep the packet unopened so long as I was  kind to her, so long as she was protected by my care; but if at any time I  withdrew my help from her, and she was in difficulty or want, she was then to  open the packet and read the letters. Her own good sense would tell her how to  act when she had read them. In a word, the letters were to remain in this  girl&rsquo;s possession as a sword to hang over my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried to make the girl understand the infamy of  such a line of conduct &mdash; tried to make her see that her grandmother had  schooled her in the vilest form of <em>chantage</em>.  &lsquo;You see me willing to help you freely, generously, for the sake of an old  friend,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;and surely you would not use these letters as a lever to  extort money from me.&rsquo; All my arguments were useless. The discipline of the  convent had taught the girl blind and implicit obedience to priests and  parents. She would not consider anything except the fact that certain  instructions had been given to her by her dying grandmother, and that her duty  was to obey those instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was patient at the beginning; but the unhappy  creature&rsquo;s dogged resistance made my blood boil. Passion got the better of me.  I caught her by the shoulder with one hand, while I snatched the packet from  her feeble grasp with the other. I was beside myself with rage. While I bent  over her, holding her as in a vice, she gave a sudden shriek, a shriek of  horrified surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The face in the wood,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;the murderer!  the murderer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hand relaxed its grip; she broke from me, and  dashed open the door of the carriage. &lsquo;I will tell people what you are!&rsquo; she  gasped, breathless with fury. &lsquo;You shall not escape. Yes, I remember your face  now &mdash; the face I saw in my dreams &mdash; the savage face in the wood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was on the footboard, clinging to the iron by  the window, muttering to herself like a mad thing. God alone knows what she  meant to do. She wanted to make my crime known, to bring the train to a  standstill, to have me arrested then and there. While she stood wavering on  that narrow ledge, her life hanging by a thread, the train rounded the curve  and passed on to the viaduct. The stony gorge was below, deep and narrow, like  an open grave &mdash; tempting me &mdash; tempting me as Satan tempts his own. One sudden  movement of my arm, and all was over. I had held her, for the first few  moments. I had tried to save her. Had she been reasonable, I would have saved  her. But there was no middle course. Ruin, unutterable ruin for me, or death  for her. One motion of my arm, and she was gone. Light as a feather, the frail  little figure fluttered down the gorge. Another minute, and the train stopped.  I had my railway-key ready before the stoppage, and did not lose an instant in  getting along the off-side of the line back to the compartment I had left.  Every head without exception was turned towards the side on which the girl had  fallen. The only witness of my crime had been destroyed, and my letters were  safe in my own keeping, to be burned at the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You burned them that night,&rdquo; said Dora. &ldquo;I  remember. And that tress of hair which you were looking at when I went into the  library&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was cut from Marie&rsquo;s head after death. The mother  had placed it amongst those fatal letters. That night, after an interval of  years, I touched the soft bright hair on which my hand had so often lingered in  adoring love &mdash; that lovely hair which my hand had stained with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no more to be told. An awful silence  followed, a silence in which even Dora&rsquo;s sobs no longer sounded. There was a  tearless agony which was deeper than that passion of tears.</p>
<p>She rose from her knees and turned towards  Heathcote, white to the lips, icy cold, looking at him as if he had been a  stranger, and as if she expected no more mercy from him than from a stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You have  come here alone; but perhaps there are people waiting outside &mdash; policemen, to  take my husband to prison. He cannot run away from them; your victim is quite  helpless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My victim? O Dora, how cruel that sounds from  you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; she said hurriedly. &ldquo;I asked you to  find out the mystery of that murder, and you have obeyed me. My husband &mdash; my  husband an assassin!&rdquo; she cried, flinging her clasped hands above her head in  an access of despair; &ldquo;my husband, whom I believed in as the noblest and best  of men. He was tempted to blackest sin &mdash; tempted by the madness of jealousy,  wrought upon afterwards by a sudden panic. He was not a despicable sinner &mdash; not  like the man who poisons his friend, or who kills the helpless for the sake of  money. It was an ungovernable passion which wrecked him &mdash; it was a fatal love  which led him to crime. Heathcote,&rdquo; falling at his feet with a wild cry of  appeal, &ldquo;have mercy on him; for my sake, have mercy. Think of his helplessness.  Remember how low he has been brought already &mdash; how heavily God&rsquo;s hand has been  laid upon him. Have mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heathcote lifted her from her knees, as he had done  once before in his life, when she pleaded to him for pardon for her own  falsehood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not hurt a snake if you loved it, Dora,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;Neither you nor your husband have anything to fear from me. Parisian  juries are very merciful; but I will not submit Mr. Wyllard to the  inconvenience of a trial. As for the episode upon the railway &mdash; we will try to  think <em>that</em> an accident, an unlucky  impulse, unpremeditated, falling considerably short of murder. No, Dora, I do  not intend to deliver up your husband to the law. The one person who has the  highest right to cry for vengeance has learnt the sublimity of submission to  the Divine Will. I have seen the widowed mother of Maxime de Maucroix; and from  her lips I have heard the reproof of my own revengeful feelings. But although I  am content to be silent, it would be well for Julian Wyllard, when he shall  feel the hand of death upon him, to write the admission of his guilt; since  that alone can thoroughly clear your cousin Bothwell before his fellow-men. So  dark a suspicion once engendered may hang over a man for a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will bear in mind your thoughtful suggestion,&rdquo;  said Wyllard. &ldquo;I thank you, Heathcote, for your mercy to a fallen foe. A wretch  so abject, so smitten by the hand of Fate, would be too mean a creature for  your revenge. You are not like the noble Achilles, and would hardly care to  drag a corpse at your chariot-wheel, and wreak your rage upon impotence. The  play is played out, the lights are down. Let the curtain fall in decency and  silence. For <em>her</em> sake be merciful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make your peace with your offended God, if you  can,&rdquo; answered Heathcote. &ldquo;You have nothing to fear from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved slowly towards the door, and at the last  turned and held out his hand to Dora. She hesitated for an instant, looking at  her husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him your hand, Dora,&rdquo; said Wyllard. &ldquo;I can  bear to see you clasp hands with the man who has read the riddle of L&eacute;onie  Lemarque&rsquo;s death. I have come to a stage at which life and death make but  little difference to me, and even shame is dead. Give him your hand. You may  need his friendship and protection some day when I am under ground, and when  people look at you with a morbid interest, as the murderer&rsquo;s widow. It will be  wise to shuffle off my tainted name as soon as you decently can. Change it for a  better name, Dora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julian, how can you be so cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was by his side again, with her hand in his,  forgetful of all things except her love for him, her pity for his pain. All her  natural horror at his guilt was not strong enough to extinguish her love, or to  lessen her compassion. As she had pitied him for his physical infirmity, so she  now pitied him for his mental infirmity &mdash; a mind swayed to crime by  undisciplined passions.</p>
<p>Heathcote left the room without another word. He  had come there as the messenger of Fate. He had no further business in that  house.</p>
<p>He had heard from the butler that Sir William  Spencer and the local physician had been in consultation together that  afternoon, and that the man had gathered from their talk as they left the house  that Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s illness was likely to end fatally, sooner than Sir William  had at first supposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me my sleeping draught, and then go, Dora,&rdquo;  said Wyllard, when he and his wife were alone.</p>
<p>She prepared to obey him. The nurse was taking her  rest at this hour, and it was the wife&rsquo;s privilege to attend upon her husband.  The morphia sleeping draughts had been administered with rigid care, Dora  herself watching the allotment of every bottle, lest the unhappy sufferer  should be tempted to take an overdose and end the tragedy of pain. Once, when  she had betrayed her anxiety by a word spoken unawares, she had seen a curious  smile upon her husband&rsquo;s pale lips, a smile that told her he had read her  thoughts; and now she felt the peril of suicide was a much nearer dread. What  had he to live for now &mdash; he who stood confessed a murderer, before the wife who  had revered him?</p>
<p>The sleeping draughts had been sent in from the  local doctor, half a dozen at a time, the patient taking two and sometimes  three in the course of the day and night. Dora kept them under lock and key in  the cabinet, where she kept her drawing materials, an old tulip-wood cabinet of  Dutch inlaid work that stood in a corner of the room, at some distance from the  sick man&rsquo;s sofa.</p>
<p>On the table by his side stood his dressing-case,  with its glittering array of silver-gilt-topped bottles &mdash; eau de cologne,  toilet vinegar, sal volatile. His medicine glass was on the same table.</p>
<p>And now, while Dora stood with her face towards the  cabinet, Wyllard&rsquo;s crippled hands were busied with one of those bottles in the  dressing-case. With a wonderful swiftness and dexterity, taking into account  the condition of his hands, he drew out one of the smallest bottles in the  case, and unscrewed the stopper. The bottle contained about half an ounce of a  clear white liquid.</p>
<p>Wyllard poured this liquid into a glass, which he  held ready for Dora when she brought him the sleeping draught. The colourless  liquid would have hardly showed in the bottom of the glass under any  circumstances, but Wyllard was careful to screen it with his hand.</p>
<p>Dora poured out the sleeping draught, looking at  him all the while in saddest silence. What could she say to him from whose  familiar face the mask had fallen? The husband she had loved and honoured was lost  to her for ever. The helpless wretch lying there was a stranger to her; a  sinner so begrimed with sin that only the infinite compassion of woman could  behold him without loathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink this to your future happiness, Dora,&rdquo; he  said solemnly, &ldquo;and remember that at my last hour I blessed you for your  goodness to a great sinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was that in his tone which warned her of his  purpose. She flung out her arms, trying to seize the hand that held the glass,  before he could drink. But the table was between them, and the glass was at his  lips when he finished speaking. He drained it to the last drop, gave one long  sigh, and fell back upon his pillow &mdash; dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hydrocyanic acid,&rdquo; said the local practitioner  when he came to look at the corpse, &ldquo;and a happy release into the bargain. I  should like to have given him an overdose of morphia myself, if the law of the  land would have allowed me; or to have operated on the base of his brain and  killed him tenderly in the interests of science, just to find out whether Cruveilhier  or Virchow was right in his theorising as to the seat of the malady. I go for  Virchow, backed by Gull.&rdquo;</p>

  &ldquo;Sweet Is Death For Evermore&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Dismal hours, dreary days of monotonous melancholy,  a hopeless lassitude of mind and body, followed for Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s widow  after that awful sudden death. Every one was very kind; every one was  considerate; even the law was more than usually indulgent. The horror of an  inquest was spared to that desolate mourner. Things were made very easy by Sir  William Spencer&rsquo;s recent visit, by the fact that he had been heard by the  servants to pronounce Mr. Wyllard&rsquo;s condition hopeless. Mr. Nicholls, the local  practitioner, registered the cause of death as muscular atrophy, and considered  himself justified in so doing, as to his mind suicide had been only a symptom  of the malady, a paroxysm of despair following quickly upon Sir William  Spencer&rsquo;s admission that the end was inevitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever a man had a right to take his own life,  that man had,&rdquo; said Mr. Nicholls, when he argued the matter with his own  conscience.</p>
<p>An inquest would have done good to nobody; but Mr.  Nicholls was very anxious for a post-mortem. He wanted to see if the muscles  were much wasted, if the medulla itself showed traces of disease &mdash; whether Cruveilhier  or Virchow had the best of the argument. But he was not allowed this privilege.</p>
<p>Those early stages of bereavement, while the house  was darkened &mdash; that sunless autumn day on which the funeral train wound slowly  over the moor to the distant burial-ground, the reading of the will, the coming  and going of friends and legal advisers, were as an evil dream to Dora Wyllard.  She took no part in anything. She affected no interest in anything. Just at the  last she was asked if she would not like to lay her offering upon the coffin &mdash;  one of those costly wreaths, those snow-white crosses of fairest exotics, which  had been sent in profusion to the wealthy dead &mdash; and she had shrunk from the  questioner with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flowers upon <em>that</em> coffin? No, no, no!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet at the last moment, when the dismal procession  was leaving the hall, she appeared suddenly in the midst of the mourners, pale  as the dead, and broke through the crowd, and placed her tribute on the  coffin-lid, a handful of wild violets gathered with her own hands in the  melancholy autumn shrubberies. She bent down and laid her face upon the coffin.  &ldquo;I loved you once!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;I loved you once!&rdquo; And then kind hands drew  her away, half-fainting, and led her back to her room.</p>
<p>The blow had quite unsettled poor Mrs. Wyllard&rsquo;s  mind, people said afterwards, recounting this episode, at second, third, or  fourth hand. No one was surprised when she left Penmorval within a week of the  funeral, and went on the Continent with her two old servants, Priscilla and Stodden.</p>
<p>Heathcote and Bothwell had planned everything for  her, both being agreed that she must be taken away from the scene of her sorrow  as speedily as the thing could be done; and she had obeyed them implicitly,  unquestioningly, like a little child.</p>
<p>What could it matter where she went, or what became  of her? That was the thought in her own mind when she assented so meekly to  every arrangement that was being made for her welfare. What grief that ever  widowed heart had to bear could be equal to her agony? It was not the loss of a  husband she had adored &mdash; that loss for this life which might have been balanced  by gain in a better life. It was the extinction of a beloved image for ever. It  was the knowledge that this man, to whom she had given the worship of her warm  young heart, the enthusiastic regard of inexperienced girlhood, had never been  worthy of her love; that he had come to her weary from the disappointment of a  more passionate love than life could ever again offer to woman &mdash; the first deep  love of a strong nature &mdash; a love that burns itself into heart and mind as  aquafortis into steel. He had come to her stained with blood-guiltiness &mdash; an  unconfessed assassin &mdash; holding his head high among his fellow-men, playing the  good citizen, the generous landlord, the patron, the benefactor &mdash; he who had  slain the widow&rsquo;s only son. He had lived a double life, hiding his pleasures,  lest his gains should be lessened by men&rsquo;s knowledge of his lighter hours. He,  who had seemed to her the very spirit of truth and honour, had been steeped to  the lips in falsehood &mdash; a creature of masks and semblances. This it was which  bowed her to the dust; this it was which weighed upon her spirits as no common  loss could have done.</p>
<p>With her own hands she explored her husband&rsquo;s desk  and despatch-boxes &mdash; the receptacles for all his more important papers &mdash; in  search of any written confession which should attest the dead man&rsquo;s guilt, and  for ever establish Bothwell&rsquo;s innocence. It would have been unutterable agony  to her to have made such a confession public &mdash; to have let the curious eyes of  the world peer in upon that story of guilt and shame; yet had any such document  existed, she would have deemed it her duty to make it public &mdash; her duty to her  kinsman, who had been made the scapegoat of another man&rsquo;s crimes. Happily for  her peace there was no such paper to be found &mdash; not a line, not a word which  hinted at the dead man&rsquo;s secret; and happily for Bothwell the cloud that had  hung over him had by this time dispersed. The steadiness with which he had held  his ground in the neighbourhood, the fact of his engagement to Miss Heathcote,  had weighed with his Bodmin traducers; and those who had been the first to hint  their suspicions were now the readiest to protest against the infamy of such an  idea. Had Bothwell emigrated immediately after the inquest at the Vital Spark,  these same people would have gone down to the grave convinced that he was the  murderer.</p>
<p>But before the end of that year there occurred an  event which was considered an all-sufficient proof of Bothwell&rsquo;s innocence, and  an easy solution of the mystery of the unknown girl&rsquo;s death. A miner entered a  solitary farmhouse between Bodmin and Lostwithiel, in the dim gray of a winter  evening, and killed two harmless women-folk &mdash; an old woman and a young one &mdash;  for the sake of a very small booty. He was caught red-handed, tried, convicted,  and hanged in Bodmin Gaol: but although he confessed nothing, and died a  hardened impenitent miner, it was believed by every one in the place that his  was the pitiless hand which had sent the French girl to her doom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a little bit o&rsquo;money about her, maybe,  poor lass, and he took it from her, and when she screamed he pushed her out of  the train. Such a man would think no more of doing it than of wringing the neck  of a chicken,&rdquo; said an honest, townsman of Bodmin.</p>
<p>Thus having identified somebody as the murderer,  Bodmin was content; and Bothwell Grahame was more popular than he had ever been  in the neighbourhood. He gave the county town but little of his society, notwithstanding  this restoration to local favour. He rarely played billiards at the inn, or  loitered to gossip in the High Street. He could not forget that people had once  looked coldly upon him, that he had suffered the shame of unjust suspicion. At  Trevena he was happy, for there no one had ever so wronged him; there he was a  favourite with everybody, from the rector to the humblest fisherman. At  Trevalga, too, and at Boscastle he had friends. He could afford to turn his  back upon the people who had been so ready to think evil of him.</p>
<p>One of Heathcote&rsquo;s first cares after the Penmorval  funeral had been to write to the Baronne de Maucroix. His letter was to the  following effect:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;It is my grave duty to inform you, Madame, that  the murderer of your son has confessed his crime, and also that he has escaped  from all earthly tribunals to answer for his sins before the Judge of all men.  A painful malady, from which he had been for some time a sufferer, ended  fatally on the evening of the 19th inst., within the hour in which he confessed  his guilt. His case had been pronounced hopeless by a distinguished physician;  but it is just possible the shock caused by the unexpected revelation of his  crime may have hastened his end.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Accept, Madame, my respectful homage, and permit  me also to express my admiration of that truly Christian spirit which you  evinced at our late interview.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;EDWARD HEATHCOTE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By return of post Heathcote received an answer to  his letter; but the answer was not in the handwriting of the Baronne de Maucroix.  That hand was at rest for ever. The letter was from the Baronne&rsquo;s friend and  confessor, the cur&eacute; of the village adjacent to her ch&acirc;teau.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Monsieur, &mdash; Under the sad circumstances prevailing  at the ch&acirc;teau, I have taken it upon myself, with the permission of the late  Baronne&rsquo;s legal representative, to reply to your polite communication, which  was never seen by the eyes of my lamented friend and benefactress, Madame de  Maucroix. Upon that very evening which you name in your letter as the date of  the murderer&rsquo;s death, I called at the ch&acirc;teau, soon after vespers, according to  my daily custom; being permitted at that period of the day&rsquo;s decline to enjoy  an hour&rsquo;s quiet conversation with that saintly woman who has now been taken  from us. I was ushered as usual into the <em>salon</em>,  where I quietly awaited Madame de Maucroix&rsquo;s appearance, having been told that  she was in her son&rsquo;s room, that apartment which she used as her oratory.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I knew that it was her custom to spend hours in  that chamber of her beloved dead, absorbed in spiritual meditations; so I  waited with patience, and without surprise, for more than an hour, musing by  the fire. Then, wondering at this unusual forgetfulness in one always so  considerate, I ventured to lift the <em>porti&egrave;re</em> and to pass through the intervening <em>salon</em>,  which was in darkness, to the bedchamber, where, through the half-open door, I  saw a lamp burning.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I pushed the door a little further open, and went  in. The Baronne was on her knees beside the bed, her clasped hands stretched  out straight before her upon the satin coverlet, her face leaning forward. I  should have withdrawn in respectful silence, but there was something stark and  rigid in the dear lady&rsquo;s attitude which filled me with fear. I wondered that  she had not been disturbed by the sound of my footsteps, for my heavy shoes had  creaked as I walked across the floor. I drew nearer to her. Not a breath, not a  movement.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I bent over her and touched the clasped hands.  They were still for ever in death. It was a peaceful, a blessed ending: such an  end as they who best loved that noble creature would have chosen for her.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Accept, Monsieur, the assurance of my high  consideration.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;PIERRE DUPLESSI.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter33"></a>Chapter 33<br>
&ldquo;Who Knows Not Circe?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>The Cornish Tors, those wild brown hills upon whose  dark foreheads time writes no wrinkles, were just one year older since Julian  Wyllard&rsquo;s death, and Bothwell Grahame was established in his house at Trevena  as an instructor of the embryo Engineer. Already two lads had gone forth from  Bothwell&rsquo;s house, after six months&rsquo; training, and had done well at Woolwich.  Other lads were coming to him &mdash; sons of men he had known in Bengal. He was on  the high road to reputation.</p>
<p>After that first passionate disgust with all  things, during which he had stopped the builders, and prepared to quash that  contract which he had signed with such delight, there had come a more tranquil  spirit; and Bothwell Grahame had faced his last unexpected trouble with a  resolute mind.</p>
<p>A conversation which he had with Edward Heathcote  soon after Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s death had given him his first gleam of light.  Heathcote spoke to him hopefully of the future, and urged him to wait quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your marriage will be so much the wiser, so much  the more likely to result in lasting happiness, for this delay,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If  you are as loyal and staunch as I believe you to be; if it is really my sister  you would like to many, and not this fascinating widow, who woos you with  fortune in one hand and social status in the other; if you are really bent upon  sacrificing these good things for Hilda&rsquo;s sake, be sure she will ultimately  accept your sacrifice. In the mean time be patient, and pursue your independent  course. A woman always respects a man who can live without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot,&rdquo; answered Bothwell. &ldquo;Life will be  less than life to me till Hilda and I are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her know that, if you mean to be master  of your fate in the future,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;Time can be the only test of your  truth. If when a year is past you have not married Lady Valeria Harborough, the  chances are that my sister will begin to have faith in you. I know that she  loves you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me where she is, that I may go to her &mdash; that  I may convince her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have promised to respect her secret,&rdquo; answered  Heathcote firmly.</p>
<p>Bothwell accepted this friendly counsel with a good  grace, went back to his old lodgings at Trevena, set the builders at work  again, spent his days in the open air and his nights in hard study, ate little,  slept less, and looked like the ghost of his former self.</p>
<p>He saw no more of Lady Valeria; but a society paper  informed him early in November that she had taken a villa at Monaco. He could  guess from what fount of consolation she was obtaining oblivion of her griefs.  Her grace, her charm of manner, were dwelt upon fondly by the paragraphist. She  was leading a life of absolute seclusion on account of her recent bereavement;  but she was the admired and observed of all wherever she appeared.</p>
<p>The succeeding paragraph told of Sir George  Varney&rsquo;s residence at one of the chief hotels. He was a distinguished figure at  the tables, had broken the bank on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>Bothwell smiled a cynical smile at the  juxtaposition of those two names.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the gentleman has forgotten his  beating,&rdquo; he said to himself.</p>
<p>It was an infinite relief to him to know that Lady  Valeria was on the other side of the Channel, that her pale face could not rise  before him ghostlike amidst the home which she had ruined. He worked on with  all the better will at that embryo home of his for the knowledge that this  dreaded siren was far away &mdash; worked with such energy that the builders were  whipped out of their customary jog-trot, and laid bricks as bricks were never  laid before. Bothwell watched every brick, with a three-foot rule in his hand,  and pointed out every flaw in the setting. He paid his builder promptly, as the  work progressed, and gave him every encouragement to be speedy.</p>
<p>The alterations and improvements in the old cottage  were all completed by the end of November, and the builders had finished the  brickwork of the new rooms. The old rooms were thoroughly dry and ready for  occupation before Christmas; and Bothwell spent his Christmas in his own house,  the first Christmas he had so spent, and a very dismal one. But he had his dog,  a devoted collie, the gift of Dora Wyllard; he had his pipe and his books; and  he made the best of his solitude. He had a couple of lads &mdash; his first pupils &mdash;  coming to him early in January, and he wanted to air the house in his own  person. He was a little proud of this first house of his own, even in the midst  of his sadness, as every man is proud of the thing that he has created. He  walked about the rooms, opening and shutting doors and window-sashes, to see  how they worked. Needless to say that some of them did not work at all, and  that he had various interviews with foremen and carpenters, by whom a good deal  of tinkering had to be done before everything was ship-shape. That was  Bothwell&rsquo;s favourite expression. He wanted things ship-shape. &ldquo;He ought to call  his house Ship-shape Hall,&rdquo; said the foreman.</p>
<p>Bothwell&rsquo;s chief delight was derived from his own  little inventions and contrivances, his shelves in odd corners, his pegs and  books, and ingenious little cupboards. These he gazed upon and examined daily  in silent rapture. When his two boys came to him &mdash; long-legged brawny youths,  with open countenances, grinning perpetually for very shyness &mdash; he took them to  see all the shelves and books, and expounded his theories in relation to those  conveniences. There was not to be a slovenly corner in the house; every article  was to have its peg or book, or shelf or cupboard. Tennis-balls, rackets,  foils, single-sticks, skates, whips, guns, boots, caps, and gloves. Everything  was to be classified, departmented. Organisation was to be the leading note.</p>
<p>Before a week was over, the boys had begun to adore  Bothwell. They were sporting, and could afford to keep horses; and Bothwell and  they hunted with fox-hounds and harriers all through that long winter, far into  the gladness of spring. The boys were always with their tutor. He had no  leisure in which to abandon himself to sadness; except when he shut himself up  in his study to write to his cousin Dora, who was living in Florence, attended  by the faithful Priscilla, who hated Italy as the stronghold of the Scarlet  Lady, and by Stodden, the old Penmorval butler. Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s widow was  living in absolute retirement, broken-hearted, seeing no one, seen by no one.  The society papers had nothing to say about <em>her</em>.</p>
<p>From Bothwell, Heathcote sometimes heard of her,  heard of her with an aching heart. No message of friendship, no line of  recognition had there ever been for him in any of those letters to Bothwell, of  which he was generally told, some of which had been read to him.</p>
<p>Hilda had been quietly pursuing her studies at the  Conservatoire all this time, seeing a good deal of Parisian life in a very  modest way &mdash; that inner life of struggling artists and men of letters, and  their homely industrious families, a life in which she found much that was  intellectual, blended with a pleasant simplicity, an absence of all pretence.  She liked the Tillet girls, and she liked her surroundings; while music, which  had always been a passion with her, now became the sole object of her  existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you will come back to The Spaniards some  day, and take care of the twins and me,&rdquo; her brother said to her when they met  for an hour in the August after Wyllard&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>He had stopped in Paris to see Hilda, on his way to  Switzerland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I shall go back to the old home &mdash; when  Bothwell is married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is rather hard lines for me, seeing that I  don&rsquo;t believe Bothwell has any idea of getting married to any one except you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda blushed, and then shook her head  despondingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can tell what he means to do?&rdquo; she said.  &ldquo;General Harborough died less than a year ago. Lady Valeria could scarcely  marry within the year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if Bothwell meant to marry Lady Valeria, he  would scarcely be grinding lads at Trevena,&rdquo; answered Heathcote. &ldquo;He has  behaved so well that I feel it my duty to plead for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda put her arms round her brother&rsquo;s neck and  kissed him, by way of answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me finish my studies at the Conservatoire; and  then, at the beginning of next winter, I will go back to The Spaniards, if you  still want me there. But perhaps you will have found another mistress for the  old house before that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean, Hilda,&rdquo; he answered gravely.  &ldquo;No, there is no hope of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, perhaps. It is too soon. Dora is too  loyal and true to forget easily. But the day will come when her heart will turn  to her first love. You have never ceased to care for her, have you, Edward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, dear; such a love as mine means once, and once  only. My wife was all goodness, and I was grateful to her, and fond of her &mdash;  but that affection was not like the old love, and it never extinguished the old  love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be sure your reward will come in due time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can afford to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to Switzerland, and from Switzerland  strayed into Italy, the St. Gotha route inviting him. He spent a month at  Florence, and he saw Dora Wyllard several times during that period, for half an  hour at a time. She had taken up her abode for the summer at an hotel &mdash; near  the Abbey of the Gray Monks, in the forest of Vallombrosa, a truly romantic  spot amidst wooded hills. Hither Edward Heathcote made his pilgrimage, deeming  himself richly rewarded by half an hour&rsquo;s interview; but there was little in  those interviews to stimulate hope. The widow was bowed down by the burden of  her sorrow. Her only feeling in relation to Edward Heathcote was that he alone  upon earth knew the story of her husband&rsquo;s life, and that he alone could fully  sympathise with her in her hopeless misery.</p>
<p>There are widows and widows. While Dora Wyllard was  living alone among the pines and chestnuts of the Apennines, seeing no one but  monks and occasional tourists, and religiously, avoiding the latter, Lady  Valeria Harborough was living up the Thames, in a neighbourhood which has of  late become so fashionable that it now ranks rather as an annexe to  West-End-London than as the country.</p>
<p>General Harborough&rsquo;s widow had hired one of the  prettiest villas at Marlow, a dainty bungalow, built by an artist, who soon  tired of his toy, and exchanged the villa for a house-boat, which was less  commodious and a good deal more unhealthy, but which possessed the charm of not  being rooted in the soil. The house had seemed perfect when Lady Valeria took  it, but she had sent down a West End upholsterer with a keen eye for the  beautiful to make all possible improvements; and the result was a nest which  might have satisfied a modern Cleopatra. But it did not quite satisfy Lady  Valeria, who found fault with a good many things, and informed the upholsterer  that although his taste was fairly good, and his colouring well chosen, there  was an absence of originality in his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen other houses almost as pretty,&rdquo; she  said, &ldquo;and I have seen drawing-rooms just like this, which is worse. I hate to  live in rooms like other people&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upholsterer murmured something about a royal  princess and a royal duchess, both of whom had condescended to express  themselves pleased at his decoration of their houses; but Lady Valeria froze  him with her look of scorn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t compare me with royal  princesses,&rdquo; she said contemptuously. &ldquo;They are accustomed to let other people  think for them, poor creatures, and they take anything they can get. No one  expects originality in a palace. I don&rsquo;t wish to grumble, Mr. Sherrendale, but  I am just a little disappointed in your work. It has no <em>cachet</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The upholsterer accepted his rebuke meekly, but  with an air of being wounded to the quick; and he took care to debit his  wounded feelings against Lady Valeria when he made out his bill.</p>
<p>That villa up the river in the lovely June and July  weather seemed to be in the midst of the world&rsquo;s fair. It was gayer than Park  Lane &mdash; a more concentrated gaiety. Pleasure wore her zone a little looser here  than in London. There was just a touch of Bohemianism. People dressed as they  liked, said what they liked, did as they liked. There were few stately  entertainments, few formal dinners, or smart dances; but every one kept open  house; there was a perpetual dropping in, or going and coming, which kept  carriages and horses at work all day between houses and stations. The river was  like a high-road, and half the population lived in white flannel, and smart  tennis frocks, and eccentric hats. It was a world apart &mdash; a bright glad summer  world in which there was no such thing as thought or care; a world of shining  blue water and green meadows, dipping willows, rushy eyots, and hanging woods;  a world in which there were hardly any regular meals, only a perpetual picnic,  the popping of champagne corks heard in every creek and backwater, while  humbler revellers rested on their oars to drink deep of shandygaff; a world  musical every evening with glees, and songs, and serenades, to an accompaniment  of feathering oars.</p>
<p>In such a world as this Lady Valeria Harborough  lived over again the same kind of life she had lived at Simla &mdash; but not quite  the same; for at Simla she had maintained her dignity as General Harborough&rsquo;s  wife; she had received the worship of her admirers as a queen in the old days  of chivalry might receive the homage of true knights. Now she had a different air;  and the homage that was offered was of a different quality. That winter of  widowhood at Monaco, with her staunch ally Sir George Varney in constant  attendance upon her, had made a curious change in Lady Valeria. It had  vulgarised her with that gratuitous vulgarity which has become of late years  one of the leading notes in English society &mdash; the affectation of clipped words  and slang phrases, the choice of vulgar ideas, the studious cultivation of  vulgar manners. Naturally this acquired vulgarity of Mayfair is not quite the  same as that of Brixton or Highbury. There is not the genuine ring about it.  The accent is the accent of Patricia, but the words are the words of Plebeia.  It is, however, all the more offensive, because of that blending of aristocratic  insolence &mdash; that Pall Mall swagger which gives <em>ton</em> to the idioms of Hoxton and Holloway.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria had fallen into the fashionable slang  and the current drivel. She had left off reading, and had taken to cigarettes.  Her court was less of a court than of old, and more of a smoke-room. People  came and went, and did and said what they liked in her presence. Sometimes in  the dreamy noontide, when the closed Venetians and the shadowy rooms recalled  the atmosphere of Simla, Lady Valeria reclined in her lounging chair, fanning  herself languidly, and half stupefied with chloral, a state which she described  as being &ldquo;a little low.&rdquo; Sometimes in the evening she was all fire and sparkle,  a vivacity which her enemies attributed to dry champagne. There was a great deal  of champagne consumed at that ideal villa, but with a perpetual dropping in of  visitors &mdash; a household conducted upon the laxest principles &mdash; who could tell  what became of the wine? The empty bottles were the only difficulty, since  there seems to be no use yet invented for empty champagne bottles; the very  outcasts, the rag and bone collectors, reject them.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria was going to the bad. That was the  general opinion among her nearest and dearest &mdash; the people who ate her dinners  and drank her wine, and smoked her cigarettes, and used her luxurious rooms as  if the villa had been a club. She had taken a horror of solitude, must have a  crowd about her always, be amused, cost what it might; and as she hated her own  family she would have none of them at any price. Hence the somewhat rowdy  following which made the house by the river notorious; known by those lighted  windows which shone late into the small hours, when all other casements were  dark; known by the sound of strident laughter and the rattle of dice.</p>
<p>Lady Valeria had been ruined by a winter at Monaco.  That was what some people said. Others ascribed her deterioration to the fact  of having escaped all control, and having too much money at her disposal.  Others shook their heads, and asked what could be expected of any woman whose  guide, philosopher, and friend was George Varney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he means to be her husband,&rdquo; added one shrewd  observer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Aubrey, she detests him,&rdquo; urged another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That makes no difference. He means to marry her. A  woman who takes chloral will marry any man who makes up his mind to have her.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="Chapter34"></a>Chapter 34<br>
  &ldquo;How Like A Winter Hath Thy Absence Been&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Perhaps, among all Valeria&rsquo;s friends and admirers,  Sir George Varney was the only man who had any inkling of the truth, who was  keen enough to discover the real cause of that moral decay which in its results  was obvious to every one. He had enjoyed more of Lady Valeria&rsquo;s confidence than  anybody else, and he had watched her closely, both before and after her  husband&rsquo;s death. She had tried to keep him at a distance when they first met at  Monaco; she had let him see that her resentment was as strong as ever; but at a  race-meeting in the neighbourhood he had contrived to make his peace with her.  The gambler&rsquo;s common instinct drew them together. She was alone in a strange  land &mdash; or in other words, she knew no one except Sir George Varney whose  counsel upon turf questions was worth sixpence; and she humiliated herself, and  forgot that burning wrong of the past, tried to forget that for her sake her dead  husband had beaten this man. She allowed Sir George to call upon her one  February afternoon, and tell her all about his book for the Craven and the  First Spring, across the dainty Moorish tea-tray, with its little brazen  tea-pot, and eggshell cups and saucers. After that they became staunch allies,  if not staunch friends. Valeria had now the command of ample funds, and could  bet as much as she liked. When she took Sir George&rsquo;s advice she was generally a  winner. She invariably lost when she followed her own inclinations. He  initiated her as to the mysteries of the tables at Monte Carlo, expounded the  whole theory of martingales, and showed her how she might beguile the tedium of  her days with the occult science of chance, as exemplified by pricking rows of  figures on a card.</p>
<p>They were a great deal together as the season wore  on, and, as a natural consequence, they were talked about a great deal by that  section of society whose chief conversation is of the follies and sins of its  own particular set.</p>
<p>Sir George felt that he was getting on; but in his  heart of hearts he knew perfectly well that Valeria did not care a straw for  him, and that she was never likely to care for him. He knew that she had  passionately loved Bothwell Grahame, and that despair at his abandonment was  the mainspring of all her conduct. She was reckless of herself and of her good  name &mdash; spent her money like water &mdash; ruined her health &mdash; indulged every caprice  of the moment &mdash; gave way to every fit of ill-temper &mdash; simply because, having  lost Bothwell Grahame, she had nothing in life worth living for, except such  things as could give her feverish excitement, and with that excitement  forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Knowing all this, knowing that the woman&rsquo;s heart  was like an empty sepulchre, George Varney was not the less determined to win  her for his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suit each other so well,&rdquo; he said modestly,  when his friends congratulated him, considerably in advance, after their  manner. &ldquo;No, we are not engaged. I only wish we were; but I daresay, if I am  good, it may run to that by and by. She is a very fine woman, and has a  remarkable head for the turf &mdash; remarkable, by Jove! She&rsquo;s always wrong; but the  mind is there, don&rsquo;t you know, a very remarkable mind. And she&rsquo;s a very fair  judge of a horse, too, or would be if she would only look at his legs, which  she never does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has plenty of lucre, eh, George? I think  that&rsquo;s the main point in your case, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sorry for myself, but can&rsquo;t do without the  filthy lucre. Couldn&rsquo;t afford to elope with Mrs. Menelaus, if she was a  pauper,&rdquo; answered Sir George, with cheery frankness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some idiot told me that her husband knocked you  down at the last party they ever gave at Fox Hill,&rdquo; said his friend, with a  half grin; &ldquo;that was a lie, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there is some truth &mdash; we had a little passage  at fisticuffs: and that&rsquo;s why I mean to marry his widow,&rdquo; answered Sir George  savagely. &ldquo;I meant to have the law of him; but as he bilked the beak by dying  before the hearing of the summons, I mean to have his money by way of consolation.  It will be a pleasanter remedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lady thrown in by way of make-weight,&rdquo;  grinned his friend.</p>
<p>The time came when Sir George thought he might  venture to advance his claim, in a purely business-like manner. Lady Valeria  and he had made a splendid book for the Derby, and the lady had won something  over five thousand pounds, graphically described by her coadjutor as a pot of  money. The money was of very little consequence to her nowadays, for she had  not yet succeeded in living beyond her income; but she was as eager to win as  she had been in the old time at Simla when losing meant difficulty, and might  mean ruin. She loved the sensation of success, the knowledge that her horse had  struggled to the front and kept there at the crucial moment.</p>
<p>Emboldened by this brilliant <em>coup</em>, Sir George reminded Valeria of his patience and devotion, and  asked her to accept him as her second husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect you to marry me just yet,&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only six months since the General died &mdash; and I know women are sticklers  for etiquette in these matters, though they are leaving off widow&rsquo;s caps, and a  good deal of humbug. But I should like to have your word for the future. I  don&rsquo;t want another fellow to cut in and win the cup after I&rsquo;ve made all the  running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Valeria looked at him in a leisurely way with  that contemptuous smile of hers, a smile that had crushed so many a gallant  admirer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought we understood each other too well for  this kind of thing to happen,&rdquo; she said, with perfect good temper and  placidity. &ldquo;We have been getting on remarkably well together &mdash; and I have even  taught myself to forget your impertinence that night at Fox Hill. As to  marriage, you may be almost sure of one thing, and quite sure of another &mdash;  first, that I shall never marry at all; secondly, that I shall never marry  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir George bowed, and said not another word. The  partnership on the turf and at baccarat was too profitable to be imperilled.  But he meant the alliance to become closer and more binding, before he and Lady  Valeria had done with each other.</p>
<p>And now in this lovely July weather, when the river  and the woods were at their fairest, Sir George Varney felt himself several  furlongs nearer the winning-post than he had been at Monaco. Lady Valeria had  become a more sensitive creature of late. The strings of the lyre were played  upon more easily. In other words, Valeria had taken to chloral. Sir George was  on excellent terms with her maid, and had received information of a character  which he himself called &ldquo;the straight tip&rdquo; from that astute damsel. Lady  Valeria had her good days and her bad days; and on the bad days she was sunk in  an abyss of despair, from which not even some great success in her racing  speculations could rouse her. It was in one of these fits of despondency that  Sir George Varney made his second proposal of marriage. But this time he did  not sue as her slave, nor did he adopt the calm and <em>d&eacute;bonnaire</em> tone of a business man advocating an advantageous  alliance. He approached her with a brutal energy, a coarse plainness of speech,  which shocked the shattered nerves, and frightened her into submission.</p>
<p>He told her the scandals that were rife about her &mdash;  told her how, if she did not rehabilitate her character by becoming his wife,  she would find herself cut by society as his mistress &mdash; laughed at her  half-indignant, half-hysterical protest &mdash; told her that the world was much too  wicked to believe in any innocent alliance between a beautiful woman and a man  of forty, whose past life had not been stainless; talked to her as no man had  ever dared to talk to her until that hour &mdash; talked till she sat trembling  before him, vanquished, subjugated by the strangeness of sheer brutality, she  who a year ago had been sheltered and defended from slander and insult by the protecting  love of a noble heart.</p>
<p>She sat cowering before him. Was the world so vile  as to suspect her &mdash; and of caring for this man, whom she loathed? She covered  her face with her hands and sobbed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one upon earth who would stir a foot  to protect me against their vile slanders; not one of my own kin who would  stand up for me,&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could you expect it,&rdquo; asked Sir George, &ldquo;when  you have kept all your people at arm&rsquo;s length? You may lay long odds not one of <em>that</em> lot will take our part. I would  give some of your traducers a sound horsewhipping to-morrow, but that would do  you more harm than good, unless you mean to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horsewhip them, and I <em>will</em> marry you,&rdquo; cried Valeria, rising and rushing from the room,  tremulous with rage.</p>
<p>Upon this hint Sir George promptly acted. He took  an early opportunity of leading on a harmless youth to say something uncivil of  Lady Valeria, and thereupon chastised him in his flannels before a select  audience. The scapegoat writhed under the strong gut riding-whip, could not  understand why he was so castigated, vowed vengeance, and sent a friend to Sir  George that evening, proposing an early meeting on the sands near Ostend; at  which message Sir George openly laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When boys are rude they must be punished,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t shoot boys. Tell your young friend I am sorry I lost my  temper; and that if he will write a nice little letter, apologising to my  future wife for his rashness of speech, I shall consider we are quits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was known next day along both banks of the river  that Lady Valeria was to marry Sir George Varney immediately on the expiry of  her mourning. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> possessed itself of the fact before the <em>Morning  Post</em>, and it was recorded in all the society papers of the following week.  Bothwell Grahame read of it a week later in the <em>United Service Gazette</em>, read and was thankful; for now this  restless spirit, which had wrought him so much evil, would be exorcised and  bound for ever in the thrall of matrimony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry she is to marry a scoundrel,&rdquo; he said  to himself; &ldquo;otherwise my feeling would be unalloyed gladness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now Bothwell dared to hope that the wandering  bird Hilda might be lured home to her nest &mdash; now that doubting heart might have  faith once more.</p>
<p>If he could but write to her, tell her of Valeria&rsquo;s  engagement, ask her if he had not proved himself faithful, if she could not  trust him henceforward with perfect trustfulness! She had believed in him when  his fellow-men pointed at him as a suspected murderer; she had fled from him  because an audacious woman claimed him for her lover. Strange inconsistency of  a woman&rsquo;s heart, so strong and yet so weak!</p>
<p>Heathcote was in Italy, and Heathcote was the only  channel of communication between Bothwell and his lost love. He saddled Glencoe  and rode over to The Spaniards, where he hoped to hear of Heathcote&rsquo;s speedy  return; but the Fr&auml;ulein was quite in the dark as to her employer&rsquo;s movements.  He wrote very seldom; he left everything in her hands. She had received a  little note from Florence nearly a fortnight ago. He had written not one word  as to the probable time of his return.</p>
<p>Bothwell talked about Hilda, and insidiously  questioned the Fr&auml;ulein, who might perchance know the girl&rsquo;s whereabouts. But  Miss Meyerstein was quite as dark upon the subject as Greek society in general  was about the adventures of Ariadne. All Miss Meyerstein could tell Bothwell  was that Hilda had Glossop with her, which preference of Glossop the mild  Fr&auml;ulein evidently regarded as something in the way of a slight to herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Glossop can be trusted to know where Hilda, is,  I think I might have been trusted,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder a frivolous person like Glossop has not  told the secret to half Bodmin before now,&rdquo; said Bothwell.</p>
<p>He wrote to Hilda that night, enclosing his letter  to Heathcote at Florence. It seemed a wearily roundabout way of reaching Hilda,  who might be in Scotland or in Scandinavia for all he knew; but it was his only  way, and it was just possible that she might be with her brother, and receive  his letter sooner than he dared hope. He wrote a few lines to Heathcote with  the enclosure, telling him about Lady Valeria&rsquo;s engagement. &ldquo;I suppose when  they two are married our banns may be put up in Bodmin Church,&rdquo; he wrote;  &ldquo;unless Hilda has any other objection to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He counted the days, the hours almost, while he  waited for a reply to his letter. He followed the letter in its journey, now  over sea, and then over land &mdash; halted with it at Calais, went southward with  it, skirted the Mediterranean, pierced the Alps, and then it was all darkness.  Who could tell where the letter might have to go after it reached Florence?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She may be hiding herself somewhere in England,  and that wretched letter may have to travel all the way back again,&rdquo; he told  himself ruefully.</p>
<p>He waited, and waited, and waited; bearing himself  with a brave front before his pupils all the while, teaching them, botanising  with them, boating, riding; shooting with them, and never once losing temper  with them on account of his own trouble. But he was suffering an agony of  impatience and suspense all the same, and one of the more thoughtful of his  lads saw that he was paler than usual, and worn and haggard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t work with us if you are ill, Mr.  Grahame,&rdquo; said the boy; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll get on with our work by ourselves for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear boy, I&rsquo;m not ill; I have not been  sleeping very well lately &mdash; that&rsquo;s all. &lsquo;Sleep that knits up the ravelled  sleave of care.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we can&rsquo;t get on without that beggar,&rdquo;  answered the boy. &ldquo;I know what it is to be awake all night with the toothache.  I&rsquo;ve often wondered that the nights should be so jolly short when one&rsquo;s asleep,  and so jolly long when one&rsquo;s awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At breakfast a few days later one of the lads, the  son of a brother officer of Bothwell&rsquo;s, looked up from the <em>Evening Standard</em> with an exclamation of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the widow of one of your old friends gone  and got married, Mr. Grahame,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&lsquo;At Galbraith Church, N.B., Sir George  Varney, Bart., of the Hop Poles, Maidstone, to Lady Valeria Harborough, of  Galbraith Castle, Perthshire, and Fox Hill, Plymouth.&rsquo; You saved the old  General&rsquo;s life up at the hills, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked the boy. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard my  father talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t worth talking about, Hector,&rdquo; answered  Bothwell. &ldquo;The General was a good friend to me, and I honour his memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than Lady Valeria does, or she wouldn&rsquo;t marry  such a cad as Varney. I&rsquo;ve heard my father say he is a cad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is safer not to repeat opinions of that kind,&rdquo;  said Bothwell.</p>
<p>He tried to play the schoolmaster while his heart  was beating furiously for very joy. She was married, that viper who had so  well-nigh spoiled his life; she was married to a scoundrel who would make her  life miserable, and he, Bothwell, was his own man again. Hilda could have no  further justification for distrust. He had held himself aloof from the siren,  he had demonstrated by his conduct that he had no hankering after her or her  fortune; and now that she was safely disposed of in second wedlock, Hilda could  have no excuse for delaying his happiness.</p>
<p>All things had gone well with him, except this one  thing. He had built and furnished his house, and laid out his garden; people  were full of praises for his taste and cleverness. He had been lucky with his  pupils, and he liked his work. He was able to save money, and before the year  was out he had laid aside the first hundred pounds towards the extinction of  his debt to his cousin. But Dora did not want the debt extinguished, and had  written him an indignant letter when he offered to pay the money into her  banking account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dare you pinch and scrape in order to pay me  off?&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;How do I know that you are not half-starving those poor lads,  in your desire to get out of my debt? It is your paltry pride which rebels at  an obligation even to your adopted sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To atone for the harshness of her letter she sent  him an old Florentine cabinet of ebony and ivory, a gem which glorified his  drawing-room, already enriched by her gifts; for she had sent him bronzes from  one place, and pottery from another, and glass from a third. She had made up  her mind that when the time came for Bothwell to lead his young wife home, the  home should be in some wise worthy of the wife.</p>
<p>And now there was an end of all uncertainties about  that first unhappy entanglement of Bothwell&rsquo;s; and nothing but caprice need  keep him and Hilda apart any longer.</p>
<p>A fortnight had gone since he had written to Hilda,  and there had been no sign. It was the fifth day after the announcement of Lady  Valeria&rsquo;s marriage in the London papers, and Bothwell started once more upon  that long ride by moorland and lane, across country from Trevena to Bodmin, and  thence to The Spaniards. He expected the smallest comfort at the end of his  journey; only a little talk with the Fr&auml;ulein, who might have had a recent  letter from Heathcote, and might be able to tell him something, were it ever so  little. She was always friendly and compassionate; and she was always ready to  talk to him about Hilda, and that was much. On one occasion she had gone so far  as to take him into Hilda&rsquo;s private sitting-room, and let him gloat over the  rows of prettily-bound books &mdash; Tennyson and Browning, and Dickens and Thackeray  &mdash; and the little tables, and manifold nicknacks, the mantelpiece border which  those dear hands had worked. There stood his own photograph, framed and  curtained with plush, as if it were too sacred for the common eye. He had given  her a smaller copy of the same photograph, and he hoped that she had taken that  with her, that she looked at it sometimes, among strange faces.</p>
<p>Miss Meyerstein expatiated on Hilda&rsquo;s abrupt  departure, and the little luggage with which she had provided herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only her dressing-bag and a small portmanteau,&rdquo;  said the Fr&auml;ulein. &ldquo;She left all her pretty frocks hanging in the wardrobe; all  her laces and ribbons, and gloves and ornaments in her drawers. She must have  had to buy everything new. And there is her wedding-gown, just as it came from  the dressmaker&rsquo;s the day after she left home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, at Bothwell&rsquo;s urgent, reiterated  entreaty, Miss Meyerstein went into the adjoining room, and came back, after a  rattling of keys, bringing with her a white object which looked like the  sheeted dead being carried away from a plague-stricken house.</p>
<p>It was only Hilda&rsquo;s wedding-gown, wrapped in  voluminous coverings of white linen.</p>
<p>Miss Meyerstein flung off the coverings, and shook  out the white satin gown, satin of so rich a fabric that it took all manner of  pearly and opal hues in the autumn light &mdash; a smart little frock, with a round skirt,  and just one big puff at the back of the waist, like a carelessly-tied sash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Short, for dancing,&rdquo; said Miss Meyerstein, as she  held out the frock at arm&rsquo;s length, dangling in the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she didn&rsquo;t expect to dance upon her  wedding-day!&rdquo; ejaculated Bothwell stupidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but afterwards. She would go to dances, and  she would be expected to appear as a bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; muttered Bothwell, wondering how many  dances &mdash; save the dances of pixies in a moonlit glen &mdash; might be expected to  occur within easy reach of Trevena.</p>
<p>He knelt and kissed the hem of the white satin  frock, and then turned away with a sigh that was almost a sob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a grain of dust has got to it,&rdquo; said Miss  Meyerstein. &ldquo;It will be ready when it is wanted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Bothwell. &ldquo;The gown will be ready  when it is wanted; but who can tell who the bridegroom will be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be nobody if he is not you,&rdquo; said Miss  Meyerstein. &ldquo;That poor child positively adores you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? It is nearly a year since you saw  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such love as that does not wear itself out in a  year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To-day Bothwell felt that he wanted even such poor  comfort as might be had from feminine twaddle of this kind. He felt that even a  romp with the twins would do him good. They were of her race, and she had loved  them, and they could prattle to him about her.</p>
<p>It was a rainy afternoon late in October, a dreary  day for that long ride over the hills. The Atlantic yonder had a look of  unspeakable melancholy; a great gray sea into which gray earth and sky melted.  It would be dark before Bothwell could get back to Trevena, and the ride was  not the pleasantest after nightfall; but a man who had ridden through Afghan  passes in his time was not to be scared by dark hills and narrow lanes.  Bothwell was in a mood to ride somewhere, were it only in the hope of riding  away from his own impatient thoughts. He had delayed starting till after  luncheon, having waited to give his boys the full benefit of a long morning&rsquo;s  work. It was between five and six when he came to the iron gates of The  Spaniards, and the sun was setting behind the hills yonder above Penmorval,  poor deserted Penmorval, where the pictured faces looked out upon empty floors,  and where the housekeeper sighed as she went from room to room, attending to  fires that warmed desolate hearths.</p>
<p>The Spaniards looked a little more cheerful than  when Bothwell had seen it last, for there were lights in many of the lower  windows, and those lamp-lit casements glowed brightly across the rainy dusk. He  would be able to get a good cup of tea from the Fr&auml;ulein, and to put up his  horse for an hour or two before he turned homewards again.</p>
<p>An empty carriage passed him in the drive, and  turned towards an opening in the shrubbery that led to the stable-yard. There  were visitors at The Spaniards, upon that wet evening! Bothwell wondered who  the guest, or guests, could be, in the absence of the master.</p>
<p>Or was it the master himself who had come back? His  heart beat faster at the thought. He dismounted and rang the bell. The door was  opened directly. There were a couple of servants in the hall and some luggage.  Yes, the master of the house had returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take my horse to the stables, like a good fellow,&rdquo;  said Bothwell to the man who had opened the door. &ldquo;Your master has come home, I  see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, ten minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bothwell waited to ask no further questions, did  not wait to be announced even, but walked straight to the library, Heathcote&rsquo;s  usual sitting-room, opened the door, and went in.</p>
<p>There was no lamp. The room was lighted only by the  fire-glow, which gleamed on bookshelves and old oak panelling, and on the  massive timbers of the ceiling. There was a tea-table in front of the wide old  fireplace &mdash; one of those vagabond tea-tables which can make themselves at home  anywhere &mdash; and the tea was being poured out by a girl who wore a neat little  black velvet toque and dark cloth jacket, a girl who looked as if she had just  come off a journey, while Heathcote reposed in his armchair on the other side  of the hearth.</p>
<p>No one but Hilda could have been so much at her  ease in that room, which was in some wise a sacred chamber, especially reserved  for the master of the house. No one but Hilda had such pretty hair, or such a  graceful bend of the head. The girl in the velvet toque was sitting with her  back to Bothwell; but he had not a moment&rsquo;s doubt as to her identity.</p>
<p>He went over to the hearth, gave his hand to  Heathcote silently, and then seated himself by Hilda&rsquo;s side, she looking up at  him dumbly the while, half in fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you to say to me, Hilda, after having  used me so ill?&rdquo; he asked, taking her hand in his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only that it was for your own sake I went away on  the eve of our marriage,&rdquo; she answered seriously. &ldquo;I did not want to stand  between you and happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it not have been wiser, and fairer to me, if  you had taken my views upon the matter before you ran away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would have been too generous to tell me the  truth; you would have sacrificed yourself to your sense of honour. How could I  tell you did not love Lady Valeria better than me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had read <em>Tom Jones</em> you would have had a very easy way of solving that  question. You would have had only to look in the glass, and there you would  have seen, as Sophia Western saw, the reason for a lover&rsquo;s devotion. You would  have seen purity and innocence, and fresh young beauty; and you would have  known that your lover could not falter in his truth to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think Tom&rsquo;s conduct was altogether  blameless, in spite of the looking-glass, eh, Bothwell?&rdquo; said Heathcote,  laughing at him. It is so hard to have to make love before a third person. &ldquo;You  have to thank me for bringing home your sweetheart. I read the advertisement of  Lady Valeria&rsquo;s marriage at Genoa three days ago, as I was on my way home; so I  stopped in Paris, and brought this young lady away from her musical studies at  an hour&rsquo;s notice. I suppose she was getting tired of the Conservatoire, for she  seemed uncommonly glad to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you were in Paris?&rdquo; cried Bothwell. &ldquo;So near!  If I had only known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There would have been nothing gained by following  her,&rdquo; said Heathcote. &ldquo;I never met with a more resolute young woman than this  sister of mine. When she was determined to have you, there was not the least  use in opposing her, and when she had made up her mind not to have you, she was  just as inflexible. But now that Lady Valeria has taken to herself a second  husband, and that you seem to bear the blow pretty cheerfully, perhaps Hilda  may be inclined to change her mind for the second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her wedding-gown is hanging in her wardrobe ready  for her,&rdquo; said Bothwell, drawing a little closer to his truant sweetheart, in  the sheltering dusk, that delicious hour for true and loving hearts,  blind-man&rsquo;s holiday, betwixt dog and wolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know that?&rdquo; asked Heathcote.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Fr&auml;ulein told me. She has been taking care of  your wedding-gown, Hilda. She knew that it would be wanted. You had better wear  it as soon as possible, dearest. It is a year old already; and it is going more  and more out of fashion every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall wear it before we are a month older,&rdquo;  said Heathcote. &ldquo;I have had too much trouble about this marriage already; and  I&rsquo;ll stand no more shilly-shallying. We&rsquo;ll put up the banns next Sunday; and in  less than a month from to-day you two foolish people shall be one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Heathcote kept his word, and the smart white  satin frock was worn one bright morning in November, worn by the prettiest  bride that had been seen in Bodmin Church for many a year, the townspeople said  &mdash; those townspeople who had now only praises and friendliest greetings for  Bothwell Grahame, albeit a year ago he had seemed to them as a possible  murderer.</p>
<p>A telegram had informed Dora Wyllard of the  wedding-day, so soon as ever the date had been fixed, but she had not  responded, as Hilda and her brother had hoped she would respond, to the  invitation to be present at the wedding. She could not bear to see the Cornish  hills yet awhile, she told Hilda, in her letter of congratulation. Years must  pass, in all probability, before she could endure to look upon that familiar  landscape again, or to see that roof-tree which had sheltered her when she was  Julian Wyllard&rsquo;s happy wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am rejoiced to know that you and Bothwell have  come to a safe haven at last,&rdquo; she wrote. &ldquo;I shall always be interested in  hearing of your welfare, cheered and comforted by the thought of your bright  home. I cannot blame you for having made Bothwell wait for his happiness,  Hilda; for I feel that you have acted wisely in making sure of his free choice.  There can now be no after-thought, no lurking suspicion to come between you and  your wedded love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my own part I am at peace here, and that is  much. I read a great deal, paint a little every day; and my picture, however  bad it may be, is a kind of companion to me, a thing that seems to live as it  grows under my hand. My models interest me, and through them I have become  acquainted with several humble households in Florence, and find a great deal to  interest me in this warmhearted, hot-headed race. Best of all, I am away from  old scenes, old associations; and sometimes, sitting dreaming in my sunny  balcony, with the blue waters of the Arno gliding past under my feet, I almost  believe that I am some new creature without a history, and not that Dora  Wyllard who was once mistress of Penmorval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you and Bothwell would take your honeymoon  holiday in the South, and spend a week or two here with me. There is plenty of  accommodation for you in these grand old apartments of mine &mdash; a first-floor of  a dozen rooms, all large and lofty. My old servants keep everything in  exquisite order, and are devoted in their attention to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a pleasure to me to see your brother when  he was staying in Florence. Tell him that I left Vallombrosa only a week ago,  and was very sorry to come away from wood and mountain even then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hilda and her husband accepted this friendly  invitation, and spent half their honeymoon on the road to Florence, and the  other half in that picturesque city. They found Dora the shadow of her former  self. She had a gentle air of resignation, a pensive placidity which was  inexpressibly touching. She never mentioned her dead husband. She was full of  thoughtfulness for others, and had made herself the adored benefactress of a  little colony of poor Florentines. She had furnished her rooms and established  herself in a manner which indicated the intention to make a permanent home in  the city; and here Bothwell and his wife left her, with deep regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you never come back to Cornwall, Dora?&rdquo; Hilda  asked piteously, in the last farewell moments at the railway-station.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never is a long word, dearest. I suppose I shall  see the old places again some day; but I must be a good deal older than I am  now &mdash; a good deal further away from my old sorrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora spoke without reckoning upon that Providence  which shapes our ends in spite of us; and happily for the cause of true love,  Providence found a way of bringing Dora Wyllard back to Cornwall much sooner  than she had intended to return.</p>
<p>A little more than a year after Bothwell and his  wife left Florence, the happy home at Trevena was darkened by the shadow of an  awful fear. A son had been born to Bothwell Grahame; and before the boy was a  week old the young mother was in imminent danger of death. Edward Heathcote was  in Italy, spending his autumn holiday, going over much of the same ground that  he had visited before, and loitering longer and later than the previous year. A  telegram from Bothwell told him of his sister&rsquo;s peril; and another telegram  reached Mrs. Wyllard from the same source. Moved by the same impulse, Dora and  Heathcote met at the station, each on the same errand, bent on starting by the  first train for Paris. They travelled together in sad and silent companionship,  each oppressed by the fear of a great calamity.</p>
<p>Heathcote had telegraphed before he started, asking  for a telegram to meet him at the Paris station, and here the message brought a  ray of comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little better. The doctors are more hopeful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxious days and nights followed Dora&rsquo;s arrival at  Trevena. Poor Bothwell suffered a suppressed agony of grief, which seemed to  have aged him at least ten years by the time the crisis was past, and the young  mother was able to smile upon her firstborn. Happily these markings of care are  soon erased from youthful faces; and before Christmas Bothwell was himself  again, and ready to receive a new batch of pupils, the old lot having been  disposed of triumphantly in the summer before his son&rsquo;s birth.</p>
<p>Dora stayed in Cornwall during that winter of &lsquo;83  and &lsquo;84, and she is in Cornwall still, but not at Penmorval. She has  established herself at her birth-place, Tregony Manor, near the Land&rsquo;s End; and  here old friends and neighbours flock round her, the people who knew her  mother, the friends of her childish days, of her happy girlhood. They bring  back sweet memories of the old time, and help to wean her from her gloomy  thoughts.</p>
<p>One of her old companions, a spinster of thirty  summers, is very often with her in the familiar home. They seem almost like the  girl-friends of the past, painting together, playing, singing, working. All the  old occupations have been resumed; as if the ten years intervening had hardly  made any break in the two lives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes I fancy it is all a dream, and that you  have never been away from Tregony,&rdquo; says Miss Beauchamp, one morning when they  are sitting at work. &ldquo;If we had but your dear good mother over there in her  favourite, chair by the fireplace, I should quite believe the last ten years to  be only a dream. But she is gone, dear soul, and that makes a sad difference.  Do you know, yesterday, when I looked out of the window, and saw you and Mr.  Heathcote walking on the terrace, I rubbed my eyes to make sure that I was  awake. You both looked exactly as you used to look ten years ago, when you were  engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dora went on with her work in placid silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dora, he is so good, so loyal, so devoted to you,&rdquo;  cried Miss Beauchamp, in her affectionate impulsive way. &ldquo;You cannot be so  cruel as to spoil his life for ever. Surely you will reward him some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; sang Dora softly, with her face bent  low over her work: and her story ends thus with the refrain of a popular  ballad.</p>
