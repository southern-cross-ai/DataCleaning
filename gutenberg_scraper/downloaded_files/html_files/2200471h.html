  &ldquo;We Play With Light Loves In The Portal&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Mabel  Burniston was Lady Burniston&rsquo;s youngest daughter&mdash; youngest and only unmarried  daughter; all the others&mdash;and there had been four of them&mdash;were satisfactorily  settled. That Mabel was Lady Burniston&rsquo;s daughter is said advisedly, for though  of course she was Sir John Burniston&rsquo;s daughter too, no one ever spoke of Sir  John as having anything or being anything. He was one of the many nobodies of  life. But his wife was far from being nobody. A woman who has brought up five  daughters, and married four of them off as each reached the age of nineteen,  certainly deserves to be considered somebody among English matrons: especially  when it is borne in mind that these four young ladies had not been remarkable  for good looks, neither had they any fortunes&mdash;at least, none worth speaking of.  Now it was Mabel&rsquo;s turn, and if the first four had done well, she was expected  by her mother to do still better; for, unlike her sisters, Mabel Burniston was  exceedingly pretty, so pretty that already she was acknowledged as the beauty  of the season. She was rather small and very fair; but her figure was as  perfect in shape as her face in color. Her hair was of that bright golden hue  which is still so uncommon, in spite of all that can be done by &ldquo;auriferous  fluid&rdquo; and other preparations. She wore this golden hair in a thick fringe on  her white forehead, coming down nearly to the delicately penciled eyebrows,  beneath which shone out a pair of the most lovely, dazzling blue eyes that ever  bewitched mortal man. Very young, very fond of pleasure, full of life and  spirits, and an acknowledged belle, it was no wonder, perhaps, that Mabel  should be a flirt. Still it was a pity, thought her mother, because it might  spoil her prospects; it was a pity, thought her cousin Douglas M&rsquo;Kenzie,  because it might break his heart.</p>
<p>It  was a warm afternoon in May, and Douglas, a dark, handsome, grave looking young  man, was sitting in his aunt&rsquo;s London drawing room, nursing his hat and stick,  and talking earnestly to Mabel, who was sometimes listening, sometimes teasing  her canary bird, whose gilt cage hung amid the flowers in the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now will you not allow that I had some reason for my ill-temper, and forgive  me, and let us be friends again?&rdquo; said Douglas, getting up and coming over to  Mabel, who was occupied with the canary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I like Captain Maudesley, and he waltzes divinely, and I mean to dance with him  as often as I like; and I don&rsquo;t allow that you have any right to lecture me  about it,&rdquo; spoke Mabel, carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  right! Do you mean that, Mabel?&rdquo; asked Douglas, tenderly and reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  Douglas, I do mean it, if I am to be bothered about every man I am the least  bit civil to, and taken to task about every round dance I give to any one  except yourself. It&rsquo;s a bore!&rdquo; exclaimed the spoiled beauty, pettishly.</p>
<p>A  sort of spasm passed over Douglas M&rsquo;Kenzie&rsquo;s dark, grave face as he said  bitterly, &ldquo;Then my love is &lsquo;a bore&rsquo; to you, Mabel, It has come to that already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealousy&rsquo;s  always a bore,&rdquo; answered his cousin, lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jealousy  is a part of love,&rdquo; said Douglas, sadly; &ldquo;and I must have been more than  human,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if I had not been jealous last night, when you not only  could not keep one dance for me, but had not even a word or a smile for me,  though there were plenty for those empty-headed fools you chose to flirt with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,  now you are getting angry,&rdquo; said Mabel, with provoking coolness, sinking down  as she spoke, with an air of pretended fatigue, on a low chair.</p>
<p>Then,  raising those lovely blue eyes slowly to her cousin&rsquo;s troubled face, she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you don&rsquo;t like my ways, Cousin Douglas, perhaps you had better not bother your  wise head any more about me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  like your ways! Oh, Mab, Mab, when you know how I worship you!&rdquo; cried Douglas,  suddenly dropping on his knees beside her, and covering her little hands with  kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Douglas; suppose mamma were to come in,&rdquo; said Mabel, with a look of gratified  vanity, but otherwise unmoved by the passionate outburst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish she would come in, and I would tell her the truth&mdash; tell her how I love  you, and that you have promised to be my wife. I wish you had let me tell her  before,&rdquo; Douglas said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you want everything between us to be at an end, you could not do better than  tell her at once,&rdquo; said Mabel, turning petulantly away; &ldquo;and, for my part, I  give you my permission to do it,&rdquo; she added carelessly, looking from the window  as she spoke.</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie&rsquo;s face turned very pale. &ldquo;Are you thinking of what you are saying,  Mabel?&rdquo; he asked very gravely,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I am; I never speak without thinking,&rdquo; she replied, with a little  affected laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O  God, Mabel! and I thought you loved me!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, with such a tone of  despair in his voice that it moved Mabel for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  I do,&rdquo; she said hastily, &ldquo;so I do, as my cousin; as my friend, if you like; but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  loved me in a different way once. It is the old love I want, the love you  promised me last year. If you are going to tell me that you can no longer be  mine, Heaven help me!&rdquo; He came close to her where she stood by the window, and  tried to look into her face, but the blue eyes were bent resolutely on the  ground, and she only answered nervously and hastily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do take things so strangely, Douglas, and use such strong expressions; I wish  you wouldn&rsquo;t; and it is no use talking about last year. I was almost a child  then, and things are so different now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Douglas&rsquo;s  dark, stern face grew darker and sterner,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  means,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that now you have experienced a few weeks of a London season,  and find that your beauty brings you admirers by the score, you think that you  can afford to throw away my honest love as a thing of no worth. My pain is  nothing to you. Mabel, upon my soul, I believe you are a heartless flirt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, Mr. M&rsquo;Kenzie, then perhaps you had better bid me &lsquo;Good-afternoon.&rsquo; It  would be a pity that you should waste any more of your valuable time talking to  such a worthless individual,&rdquo; his cousin said coolly, though her cheek reddened  with anger.</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie looked at her earnestly for a moment, but the pretty face wore a  mocking smile. There was no sign of feeling of any kind after that slight flush  of anger, and in silence he turned and left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  Douglas, he&rsquo;ll be dreadfully wretched now,&rdquo; comfortably observed Mabel to  herself when he was gone, &ldquo;and it is all his own fault. I didn&rsquo;t want to come  to a downright quarrel; but it is just as well perhaps. I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder but  he will come to-night and try to make it up, but I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t. It would be awkward  to have him always spooning after me just now;&rdquo; and Mabel tripped across the  room to a mirror and began trying the effect in her hair of various flowers  which she selected from a magnificent bouquet sent her that morning. Mabel was  very fond of looking in the glass. Much as she was admired, she had not perhaps  among all her adorers so ardent an admirer as herself.</p>
<p>That  evening there was a dance at the Burnistons&rsquo;; not a ball, but a quiet, friendly  affair. Lady Burniston was rather famous for this sort of entertainment, and  some ill-natured persons had been known to remark that those four daughters who  had been settled so well had been &ldquo;waltzed into matrimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie, gloomily eating his dinner by himself at his club, and drinking more  sherry than was good for him, decided not to go to this party; but almost as  soon as he had arrived at this decision, changed his mind, went to his  chambers, made an elaborate toilet, put himself into a hansom, and was driven  to his aunt&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Almost  the first object his eyes lighted on as he entered the drawing-room, which had  been partially cleared for dancing, was Mabel, exquisitely dressed, looking  distractingly pretty, being whirled round to the sweet strains of the &ldquo;Soldaten  Leider&rdquo; in the arms of a tall, fair man, the happy possessor of a quite  remarkable amber mustache and whiskers, and (so it was said) of about ten  thousand pounds per annum. People had begun already to notice that Hugh  Chatterton seemed <em>epris</em> with the  pretty Mabel, and to-night the flirtation was very obvious indeed. As they  waltzed, her head, with its marvelous golden coils, almost rested on his  shoulder, and her blue eyes were raised to his in a manner calculated to  deprive him in a very short time of any small bit of peace of mind he might  have left.</p>
<p>Douglas  frowned savagely as he stood for a few moments watching the pair. There was a  block in the doorway, and he had to wait for a pause in the dance before he  could make his way further into the room.</p>
<p>Presently  there came bustling up to him a little red-haired man in spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  M&rsquo;Kenzie, how do?&rdquo; said this individual, who was generally known as &ldquo;Tommy  Otway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Douglas  only vouchsafed a growl by way of answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something  up, it appears, between Chatterton there and your fair cousin,&rdquo; thereat  remarked Mr. Otway, glancing through his shining spectacles at the dancers;  &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the third time they have danced together already this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what does it matter to you with whom my cousin dances?&rdquo; asked Douglas, fiercely  turning round upon the little man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  nothing in the world, my dear fellow, nothing in the world! Only a man can&rsquo;t  help using his eyes, you know; and this is a free country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deuced  deal too free,&rdquo; muttered Douglas, as he moved away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me introduce you to a partner for the Lancers, Douglas,&rdquo; said Lady Burniston,  whom he encountered in his passage through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  thanks; sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t dance to-night,&rdquo; he answered shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiresome  savage!&rdquo; his aunt said to herself, as, smiling sweetly, she sailed on in her  brown velvet and guipure.</p>
<p>A  few paces further on Douglas was brought to a stand close behind an ottoman, on  which were seated two old ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shocking  little flirt!&rdquo; he heard one observe, looking after Mabel, who just then went by  on Chatterton&rsquo;s arm; &ldquo;shocking little flirt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  room was warm, and the lady addressed was stout, and it was in a very spiteful  tone that she replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flirt  indeed! The way that girl has been going on this evening is simply disgusting!  I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not her mother!&rdquo; and she fanned herself vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spiteful  old cats!&rdquo; thought Douglas as he moved on; but there was a sharp pain at his  heart. He was a man who hated the very name of flirt, and he loved his cousin  Mabel very dearly. In vain he tried to get speech of her that night: she would  not even see him, and there was generally a little crowd of men about her.</p>
<p>Sad  at heart, toward the end of the evening he sauntered into the conservatory, and  there he came suddenly upon Mabel and Chatterton. Mabel was giving her partner  a rose from her bouquet, and he, as he took it, kissed the hand that gave it,  and was not rebuked.</p>
<p>Only  three evenings ago she had given a flower to Captain Maudesley under precisely  similar circumstances; and yet ere he turned away Douglas heard Chatterton say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  so you don&rsquo;t like Maudesley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  Mabel replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  he is so very military, and I don&rsquo;t like army men as a rule.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  no doubt to-morrow she&rsquo;ll tell some other fellow just the contrary,&rdquo; thought  Douglas, bitterly: but he was right; she did, or she would, if it had suited  her to do so. Mabel pursued her own way, and soon became noted, not only as a  reckless flirt, but a most capricious and heartless coquette. Her cousin  Douglas was only one sufferer among many.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2<br>
  &ldquo;Some Say, Thy Fault Is Youth, Some Wantonness&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;I  call &rsquo;em the three victims,&rdquo; said Tommy Otway. He was seated in a luxurious  chair in the smoking-room of his club, and addressed himself to a small circle  of admiring listeners, mostly very young men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  are the three victims? let&rsquo;s hear,&rdquo; said another man, sauntering up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Chatterton, Maudesley, and Branston. That little Mabel has played the very  devil with them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  that she has,&rdquo; observed the new comer. &ldquo;Chatterton, in a fit of disgust, has  gone and proposed to the very plainest girl of the season, and, what&rsquo;s more to  the purpose, he is going to marry her. Maudesley has sold out, and is now  somewhere up in the north&mdash;has turned hermit or landscape-gardener, or something  of the sort; and Branston&mdash;well, that is a more serious affair. He blew his  brains out, poor fellow, and they say it was her fault. But I don&rsquo;t believe  that; he was always rather weak in the head, and I, for one, don&rsquo;t blame Mabel  in the affair.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;What!  has she bewitched you too, Cameron?&rdquo; asked Otway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, <em>tout au eontraire</em>&mdash;that is, quite  the reverse,&rdquo; drawled Cameron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  means you have bewitched her, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked one of the others; and as  Cameron was famed for his extreme ugliness, there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>The  subject of the merriment took it very good-temperedly; he was used to being  laughed at, and when there was silence again he observed coolly, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;d like  to hear a piece of news I&rsquo;ll tell you who&rsquo;s her last conquest, and that is  Frere Berkeley. Every one was noticing the affair last night at Lady  Wycherly&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frere Berkeley! has he come back?&rdquo; exclaimed two or three together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Frere&rsquo;s here, is he? Then the Elmers are in town,&rdquo; said Otway, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right  you are, Tommy; the Elmers are in town,&rdquo; replied Cameron,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;And how is <em>she</em> looking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t  seen her myself; but, I hear, lovelier than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m.  Supposing what you say about the little Mabel to be true, there are the  materials for a very pretty little comedy, or tragedy, as the case may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  say comedy. We don&rsquo;t go in for tragedy in these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  whichever it&rsquo;s going to be. I should like to see the drama played out. Pity the  season&rsquo;s so near over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was near the end of July when the conversation just reported took place in the  smoking-room of the not very exclusive club patronized by Mr. Otway. Early in  August the Burnistons left town, and the play the little inquisitive red-haired  man was interested in was not played out till the following November; but, as  it happened, he did witness the gradual unfolding of this drama in high life,  for he managed to get himself invited down to Fairbank, the Wycherlys&rsquo; place  in Hampshire. Lady Wycherly was Mabel&rsquo;s eldest sister; a plain, but lively and  attractive woman, who possessed the art of making her husband&rsquo;s house very  pleasant both to his friends and her own, so Fairbank was always full of  visitors. Among the guests on this occasion were Mabel Burniston, Douglas  McKenzie, Frere Berkeley, and Mr. and Mrs. Elmer&mdash;the <em>dramatis personae</em> of the play which Mr. Otway wished to see played  out.</p>
<p>Mr.  and Mrs. Elmer were one of those strikingly ill-matched pairs which it makes  one indignant to see. He was sour-looking, ugly, and old; she was young and  very lovely. In style she was a bright blonde, like Mabel Burniston, but she  was far more beautiful. A sweet, gentle creature, of a loving but timid and  yielding disposition, not very clever, wholly devoid of selfishness and vanity,  Lilian Elmer was a woman whose path in the world ought to have been made smooth  for her by kind and helping hands: but it had not been so. Her story was a sad  one. Three years ago she had loved Frere Berkeley, and would have married him,  but her father had interfered (for Frere was poor then), had sent her lover  away, and married her to the old man she now called husband. She did not love  him&mdash;she would have hated him had she not been of too gentle a nature for that  &mdash;and Frere Berkeley was always near her&mdash;Frere, handsome, young, and loving her  only too well. It was a sad story, and people talked, and wondered how it would  end. This had been going on now for about two years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course you know, dear, that there are stories about him and Mrs. Elmer?&rdquo; said  Lady Wycherly to Mabel Burniston. The two sisters were sitting before the fire  in Lady Wycherly&rsquo;s dressing-room, indulging in tea and talk before dinner.  Mabel had just arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  stories?&rdquo; asked Mabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  she was in love with him before she was married, you know, and he was awfully  in love with her, and has gone on being in love with her since, which he should  not have done of course, and wherever <em>they</em> go, he goes, and so people talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary,  I do think you are rather fond of scandal,&rdquo; said Mabel, impatiently. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  believe there is anything but friendship between him and Mrs. Elmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear! Did I say there was? I only wished to give you some idea of the sort of  man he is, or rather the sort of man people say he is, as he seems to have  taken your fancy, Mab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  told you he had taken my fancy?&rdquo; asked Mabel, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  mother did,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly, after an instant&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  mother has been writing about me! Now tell me what she said,&rdquo; Mabel cried,  imperiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  her letter was private and confidential,&rdquo; replied Lady Wycherly, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t matter. I dare say it was nothing complimentary,&rdquo; Mabel said  carelessly, as she went off to dress.</p>
<p>Lady  Wycherly, when she was alone, took from her pocket the letter which had been  alluded to, and read one passage in it over again: &ldquo;He is really <em>immensely</em> rich; I am told so by people  who <em>know</em> and whom I can <em>depend on</em>. I trust to you, dear Mary, to  manage the affair, for I am tied here by Sir John&rsquo;s gout, and goodness knows  when I shall be able to get away. Of course I know all about the <em>Mrs. Elmer story</em>; but there is not the  least doubt but that Mabel may have him <em>now</em> if she likes, and the old affair will soon be forgotten by everybody &rdquo;&mdash;so it  ran.</p>
<p>There  was more of it, but Mary Wycherly read no further; she folded the letter with a  half sigh, and murmured to herself something about &ldquo;Belgravian morality,&rdquo; but  she checked the words on her lips, for it was her own mother whom she was  judging.</p>
<p>There  was at Fairbank, as there is in many houses, a small room opening out of the  large drawing-room, a nondescript apartment, furnished in boudoir style, and  used largely for flirtations, but for little else. In this room, on that same  afternoon, there were two people talking earnestly together in the firelight,  which alone illumined the small apartment. It wanted quite three quarters of an  hour to dinner time; but both the lady and gentleman were in dinner dress. A  dark, handsome man, with a fine aristocratic face; a very beautiful woman, with  masses of golden curls piled high above her white neck. She looked very young,  but she had been married for three years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lilian,  in our position we cannot afford to indulge in small scruples,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  Frere, I know&mdash;oh, I know so well, that I can no longer talk of right and wrong:  they exist no more for me! Still, there seems a meanness in this that revolts  me,&rdquo; the woman exclaimed. &ldquo;Suppose she should get to love you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  loves no one but herself,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;You need not fear for her. A woman  without a heart can always take care of herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  spoke very coolly, and the fair woman made no further remonstrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frere,&rdquo;  she whispered presently, looking up at him with a frightened expression in her  lovely eyes, &ldquo;it gets worse and worse. He threatened to strike me to-day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curse  him, the miserable, cowardly scoundrel!&rdquo; said Frere, his face turning white  with rage. &ldquo;I wish I had been by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am very glad you were not, Frere. That is what I am more afraid of than  anything&mdash;you and he quarreling.&rdquo; And she lookod round nervously toward the door  as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?  He couldn&rsquo;t hurt me,&rdquo; said Berkeley, with a contemptuous laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no, but think what he might do to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  Heaven, if ever he touched a hair of your head&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  might do worse than that; he might take me away somewhere and shut me up in  some dreadful place. I am in his power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  shuddered and trembled violently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Lilian,&rdquo; broke out Frere, passionately; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t look like that. It makes me mad  to think I can&rsquo;t take you away now, this moment, safe out of his reach forever,  Lily, my own&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  rustle of a silk gown was heard; some one had entered the next room. The young  man quietly took up a wide-awake hat and overcoat which lay on a chair near,  and in five seconds had disappeared by the way he came, through one of the  French windows which opened on to the lawn. Lilian Elmer was alone, and the  next minute came forward with a perfectly calm air and a conventional smile, to  greet her hostess. Lady Wycherly looked rather surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  came almost like a ghost out of that little room,&rdquo; she said, laughingly. &ldquo;I did  not think any one would be down yet. But perhaps it is later than I thought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, you are not late, I think.&rdquo; said Mrs. Elmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  told Simpson not to put much light in that room, but it seems he misunderstood  me for he has put none,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  firelight is very nice; I have been sitting there,&rdquo; said Lilian Elmer, quietly.</p>
<p>People  began to come in. There was a little stir as Mabel appeared. She was generally  rather over-dressed, and to-night she wore a rich dead-white silk, with a  magnificent crimson rose in her hair, and was looking her best&mdash;a fact of which  she was fully aware. Her cousin Douglas went forward and greeted her eagerly.  He had not seen her for two months, and had now come down to Fairbank intending  to prosecute his old claims: for Mabel, by her treatment of them, had plainly  shown that she cared for none of her London adorers, and Douglas hoped that  this might be because she cared for him. He blamed himself now for having been  too hard upon her, and was prepared to be very humble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  seems an age since I saw you, Mab,&rdquo; he managed to say in the moment he was  beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  doesn&rsquo;t to me. But I&rsquo;m very glad to see you, Douglas,&rdquo; Mabel answered,  brightly; and that and the clasp of the hand she gave him made Douglas happy&mdash;for  an hour or so.</p>
<p>Frere  Berkeley was the last to make his appearance. He had kept them all waiting  quite five minutes after dinner was announced, but Frere was used to keep  people waiting. He apologized carelessly to Lady Wycherly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  rode over to Thornhill this afternoon, and have only just got back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather  a wet day for so long a ride,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Otway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;  said Berkeley, with a long, cool stare that caused the impertinent little man&rsquo;s  confidence to suddenly desert him, and made him very glad of the bustle of the  move toward the dining-room.</p>
<p>When  the women were in the drawing-room alone after dinner, Mrs. Elmer went and  seated herself by Mabel, and in rather a hesitating manner began to talk to  her. Mabel was inclined to be cold and repellent at first, but the evident  shyness and nervousness of the other woman soon disarmed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is a delightful house. I have never been here before,&rdquo; Mrs. Elmer said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  do you like the house?&rdquo; said Mabel; &ldquo;I do not care for it; it is so thoroughly  modern. I like an old rambling place better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you? I cannot endure those long, dark passages and haunted-looking galleries;  they make me so nervous,&rdquo; said Mrs. Elmer, with a slight shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  you turn white only at the thought of them,&rdquo; exclaimed Mabel, laughing a  little.</p>
<p>The  other laughed too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know I am very silly about such things, but I was always such a coward,&rdquo; she  said.</p>
<p>Mabel  went on talking to her very graciously, and all the time she was wondering what  Frere Berkeley could have seen in that nervous and seemingly silly woman to  charm him for so long. Mabel did not doubt but that the old bondage was now at  an end; for had not handsome, <em>insouciant</em> Frere become her own slave? She watched anxiously for his appearance in the  drawing-room; for she had not sat near him at dinner, and had not spoken to him  yet. When he did come in he caught sight of Mabel at once, and came straight  across to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  good it was of fate to bring me down here just now, Miss Burniston,&rdquo; he  observed, in the low tone he always used when addressing women.</p>
<p>He  had come to a stand behind Mabel, and leaned on the back of the sofa on which  she and Mrs. Elmer were seated, as he spoke.</p>
<p>Mabel  turned a little and looked up at him with a coquettish air which had become part  of her very self, and she answered saucily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  why are you so pleased with fate this evening, Mr. Berkeley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I have the opportunity of renewing, and I hope improving, my acquaintance with  Miss Burniston,&rdquo; said Frere.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sure that is a very small boon for which to thank fate,&rdquo; laughed Mabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  do not agree with you,&rdquo; he said, softly; and he looked into Mabel&rsquo;s blue eyes,  and Mabel blushed as well as smiled.</p>
<p>All  this time Frere had seemed quite oblivious of the presence of the lady who  still sat beside Miss Burniston. Mabel thought Mrs. Elmer was hurt by this, for  she looked pale and <em>distraite</em>, and  soon rose and moved away to another part of the room. Frere came round and  dropped into the vacated place.</p>
<p>No  one knew better how to make himself agreeable to a woman when he liked than  Frere Berkeley, and he liked now, and before the evening was over he had  managed to establish an excellent understanding between himself and Mabel  Burniston.</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie had been seized upon early in the evening by his host, Sir George, and  set down to whist with Mr. Elmer and two stout dowagers who were devoted to the  game. Douglas had one of the dowagers for a partner, and at his peril was  obliged to attend to his cards; yet through the back of his head he seemed to  see Mabel, and his quick ears caught much of what passed between her and her  new friend: and Douglas wondered miserably whether this were only the beginning  of another of Mabel&rsquo;s reckless flirtations, or whether this visit would see the  end of his own last chance. Sour-looking, hard-featured Mr. Elmer glanced now  and then at the two and seemed well satisfied.</p>
<p>The  days passed. Lady Wycherly&rsquo;s guests walked, rode, drove, and sometimes amused  and often bored each other, as people do at all country houses. Frere Berkeley  was devoted to Mabel, and Lady Wycherly, mindful of her mother&rsquo;s wishes in the  matter, did not interfere, except once, when she had thought it necessary to  give one little word of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Mab,&rdquo; she had then said, sweetly, &ldquo;are you engaged to Mr. Berkeley?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Mary; you know I am not,&rdquo; Mabel had answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,  dear, I don&rsquo;t think it quite the thing for you to be continually walking and  driving about with him alone. I don&rsquo;t think mother would approve of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes  she would: Frere Berkeley&rsquo;s <em>rich</em>, and  that is all mother wants in a son-in-law,&rdquo; Mabel answered, with a sneer that  was not pretty. </p>
<p>Not  noticing the sneer, her sister said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why does he not propose in form, if that is how it is to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you have a man propose before he has known a girl a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  but neither would I have a girl always walking and driving about alone with a  man to whom she is not engaged, especially a man bearing the character Frere  Berkeley does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncharitable  nonsense!&rdquo; Mabel had angrily cried at that; and so there had been no more said.</p>
<p>To  Mrs. Elmer Mabel had taken a great fancy, and was with her a good deal. Frankly  acknowledging, as Mabel did, Lilian Elmer&rsquo;s great beauty, the fact increased  her own sense of triumph, and she was ready to patronize Frere&rsquo;s old love, whom  he had deserted for <em>her</em>. Then her  triumph was such a perfectly legitimate one, for had she not religion,  morality, and society on her side, all of which were in danger of being  outraged till she had come to the rescue?</p>
<p>Mr.  Thomas Otway, behind his shining spectacles, watched the play, and for some  time he was puzzled; but he watched patiently, and after a while he made one or  two discoveries, and then performed the process known as &ldquo;putting two and two  together,&rdquo; and when he had done that he looked out for some one to whom he  could communicate the result.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3<br>
  &ldquo;Out Of My Sight, Thou Serpent!&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Nothing  was talked of now at Fairbank but the great steeple-chase which was shortly to  come off in the neighborhood. Barnston steeplechase was an established affair,  there was generally a cavalry regiment quartered at Barnston, and the officers  kept up the race. It came off regularly every autumn, and was taken a good deal  of notice of in the sporting world. It was this race which had brought Frere  Berkeley down to this part of the country now; he was to ride the favorite, a  horse named &ldquo;Moloch,&rdquo; belonging to Lord Streatfield, a friend of Frere&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Moloch&rsquo;s  safe to win; take my advice, Tommy, and put every penny you&rsquo;ve got on Moloch,&rdquo;  said Cornet Supple, an excessively military young man, whose mustache was  coming on fast, and who therefore considered himself at liberty to patronize  his elders to a large extent, his own commanding officer being excepted, of  course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks&mdash;advice  is a thing I have long given up taking,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Otway, dryly, without  removing the cigar from his mouth.</p>
<p>He  and the young cornet, with two or three other men, were standing out on the  steps of the house enjoying their after-breakfast tobacco in the sunshine,  which, though it was November, was bright and warm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t mind saying that I have backed Moloch pretty heavily too,&rdquo; said another  military man. &ldquo;I know what the horse can do; and for the rider, there&rsquo;s not one  of the others comes anywhere near Frere Berkeley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie had sauntered up, and had heard the last speaker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t  they saying something yesterday in Barnston about Moloch&rsquo;s temper?&rdquo; he asked,  moodily.</p>
<p>Douglas  had been very moody lately&mdash;ill-tempered, his friends called him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  they are always saying something in Barnston,&rdquo; cried young Supple. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you  believe it, there is nothing the matter with Moloch&rsquo;s temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if there were, Frere could manage him. There never was a horse beat Frere yet,&rdquo;  said the other young soldier, confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;Kenzie,&rdquo;  said Otway, suddenly, &ldquo;will you take a turn with me? I have a word to say to  you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Douglas  assented rather ungraciously, and they walked off together.</p>
<p>Mr.  Otway seemed undecided as to how he should open his communication: he took off  his hat and rumpled up his rich hair, put on his head-gear again, a good deal on  one side, pulled out his handkerchief and blew his nose, pulled his spectacles  upon his forehead and then took them off altogether, only to put them on again  directly, with various other proceedings indicative of embarrassment, and  looked so mysterious all the time that Douglas soon lost patience. &ldquo;Speak out,  man,&rdquo; be said, testily; &ldquo;what is it you have to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it is about your cousin,&rdquo; began Otway, looking nervously round, and speaking  almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  had much rather you did not speak of my cousin, Mr. Otway,&rdquo; said Douglas,  haughtily; and he would have turned away, but the other detained him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you have any regard for your cousin and wish to save her  from an unpleasant scrape, you&rsquo;d better listen to me. M&rsquo;Kenzie, that Berkeley is an infernal villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  the devil do you mean?&rdquo; asked M&rsquo;Kenzie, turning round upon his friend in a  sudden fury. Then, as Otway in a few rapid sentences told him what he meant,  Douglas listened in silence, only swearing an oath or two under his breath as  the tale went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is that old fool Elmer about?&rdquo; he asked, when he had heard all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  doesn&rsquo;t suspect anything, don&rsquo;t you see? That&rsquo;s what it has been done for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  an infernal conspiracy,&rdquo; muttered Douglas; and his hand was clinched hard as he  walked on in silence for a minute or so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  say, whatever you do in the matter&mdash;and I suppose something must be done&mdash;for  Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t go to Elmer. He would half kill <em>her</em>, and there would be an awful row,&rdquo; said Otway, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never thought of going to him. The man is a brute and a snob, and would be  certain to make a horrible scandal, through his want of self-control. All I&rsquo;ve  got to do is to get Mabel out of this hideous entanglement, if I can; as for  the rest of the affair, thank God it is not my business,&rdquo; in which thoroughly  English view of the matter Mr. Otway quite concurred.</p>
<p>The  next morning, as Mabel Burniston, dressed for walking was crossing the hall,  she was stopped by her cousin Douglas who had evidently been waiting to intercept  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel,  I must speak to you,&rdquo; he said, authoritatively. &ldquo;Come in here;&rdquo; and he opened  the door of the library.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a bore, Douglas! What can you have to say? I&rsquo;m in a hurry,&rdquo; spoke Mabel,  pettishly; but she followed him into the room.</p>
<p>Douglas  carefully shut the door. Mabel sat down, and went on putting on her gloves,  wondering what was coming.</p>
<p>Douglas  came and stood looking down at her. &ldquo;Mabel,&rdquo; he said, gently, &ldquo;you never had a  brother. I want you to let me be your brother for the time being. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  girl looked quickly at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sure you have something dreadfully disagreeable to say,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or you  would not have begun like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have something disagreeable to say, and I hardly know how to say it,&rdquo; replied  Douglas, looking, as he felt, extremely uncomfortable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  me straight out at once, that is the best way,&rdquo; said his cousin, lightly;  adding, in the same tone, &ldquo;only I warn you if it is anything about Frere  Berkeley I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t listen to it. I am tired  of hearing him abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  Douglas M&rsquo;Kenzie saw that what he had to say would be difficult indeed in the  saying, and he plunged desperately into the subject, not choosing his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  here, Mabel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are deceived in that man; he is behaving  disgracefully. He is making love to another man&rsquo;s wife, and is using his  flirtation with you as a blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  dare you say such things to me, Douglas?&rdquo; flashed Mabel, rising from her seat,  her face crimson with indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I would save you from being mixed up in a most disgraceful affair,&rdquo; said  Douglas, firmly. &ldquo;Mabel, take my word for it, and ask no further; but, for  Heaven&rsquo;s sake, have no more to do with that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  nonsense! I know what you mean&mdash;that stupid old story about Mrs. Elmer; but I  don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said Mabel.</p>
<p>She  spoke rather hesitatingly, for looking at Douglas she could not help seeing  that he was very much in earnest, and her heart sunk and her face paled, for  Mabel Burniston loved Frere Berkeley as well as it was in her to love  anybody&mdash;besides herself. She loved him. And now she was told by one whom she  could not but believe&mdash;for Douglas never lied&mdash;that this man had been playing  with her, making a tool of her. It was a heavy blow. Douglas saw that it was,  and when she said that she did not believe it he saw that she did, so he answered nothing, but  stood twirling his mustache nervously and thinking very uncharitable thoughts  of Frere Berkeley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; reiterated Mabel; and then suddenly she threw herself on the  sofa and burst into tears.</p>
<p>Douglas  was not prepared for this, and, as men do sometimes at the sight of a woman in  tears, he &ldquo;lost his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel,  dearest Mabel,&rdquo; he cried, falling on his knees beside her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t distress  yourself about this affair. I will take care that you shall no longer be  insulted by that fellow&rsquo;s attentions. Oh, if you would only give me the right  to protect you, Mab, my darling&mdash;if you would  promise to be my wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  head was turned from him and buried in the sofa cushions, but he had her two  hands in his. Mabel was sobbing, and hardly heard what he said at first, but at  the words, &ldquo;if you would promise to be my wife,&rdquo; the hands were suddenly  wrenched from Douglas&rsquo;s grasp, and the girl started to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I see it all now!&rdquo; she exclaimed, furiously. &ldquo;You come to me with this  scandalous story, thinking to advance your own cause by injuring him in my  estimation. You first tell me a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;  said Douglas, sternly. &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do know,&rdquo; Mabel went on, excitedly. &ldquo;I am saying that I do not believe you,  and I do not. I can see it is all a plot. You guessed that I cared for him, and  you invented that story, Douglas M&rsquo;Kenzie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not say any more,&rdquo; interrupted Douglas, very calmly, though his face was  white to the lips. &ldquo;A gentleman does not condescend to answer such accusations  as those except in one way, and when they come from a woman he cannot answer  them at all. Mabel, just now I asked you to be my wife. Now I tell you that  with my will I will never speak to you again!&rdquo; and before Mabel could answer he  was gone.</p>
<p>Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie meant what he said: to be accused of telling a deliberate lie was an  insult that he could never forgive. He went away desperately hurt and fearfully  angry, and yet when he became a little calmer he could not but see that it was  partly his own fault; he had brought it on himself by his bad management; and  the short time that passed between his unfortunate interview with his cousin  and his leaving Fairbank he spent partly in her service.</p>
<p>But  Mabel, as she thought of it, made no excuse for him. She only said complacently  to herself, as she rearranged her hair, and removed the traces of tears, alone  in her own room, &ldquo;I could not have believed it of Douglas; but it only shows  that men will do anything when they are jealous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  luncheon time she went down. There were not many assembled round the table, but  Frere Berkeley was there, and Mrs. Elmer and Mr. Otway. Douglas M&rsquo;Kenzie was  not to be seen, and Lady Wycherly looked oddly at Mabel when she came in, and  directly the meal was over rose and signed to her sister that she wished to  speak to her. But just then Frere Berkeley addressed Mabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Burniston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is a lovely afternoon for a drive, and I have ordered  my new dog-cart round after luncheon, You promised to try it some day; will you  come to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should like it very much,&rdquo; said Mabel, taking care not to look at Lady  Wycherly, who she knew was making signs vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  will you go and put on your hat, for I see the trap is at the door?&rdquo; said  Frere.</p>
<p>Mabel  went, and in a very few minutes reappeared, ready for the drive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you not almost afraid to trust yourself in that rather dangerous-looking  vehicle, Miss Burniston?&rdquo; asked Mr. Otway, who was standing by criticising the  new dog-cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I had not known that it was perfectly safe, do you think I should have asked  Miss Burniston so far to honor me?&rdquo; said Frere, haughtily, and with a look that  said very plainly, &ldquo;Mind your own business.&rdquo; To Mabel he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  horse is quite enough; you are not afraid?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  not with you,&rdquo; answered Mabel. Frere pressed her hand as he carefully helped  her up, but a momentary look of distress had crossed his face as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  safe return to you!&rdquo; cried Otway; and Frere scowled savagely at him as he  mounted to his place beside Mabel. The groom left the horse&rsquo;s head, and he  dashed away. At first the drive promised to be a silent one. Frere Berkeley&rsquo;s  quiet horse somehow gave him quite enough to do to manage, and Mabel was  thinking&mdash;thinking in spite of herself and against her will&mdash;of what Douglas had  told her in the morning, and she did not feel at her ease with her companion.  The feeling grew, and her answers when Frere began to talk to her were  constrained and cold. When they were nearing Fairbank on their return, Frere  said suddenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  manner has changed to me to-day, Mabel, especially since we have been alone  together. Why is it? What have I done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  nothing,&rdquo; said Mabel, confusedly; &ldquo;I did not know I was different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you are, and I think I know why. People have been warning you against me, and  you are half inclined to believe them; is not that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  dark, handsome eyes were steadily regarding her face, and Mabel was too much  confused to reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  need not speak,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I see&mdash;your face answers me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  then the horse half shied at a freshly painted white gate, and Frere was  occupied with his driving for a minute or two. When they were once more going  along quietly, he said, with another steady look into the blue eyes of the girl  beside him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel,  I am going to ask you to trust me. I want you to promise to believe nothing  that you may hear against me for the next four days. When the race is over it  shall all be explained. Will you trust me till then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mabel  thought she knew what he meant, and she said that she would trust him.</p>
<p>Frere  thanked her, and then they were at the gates of Fairbank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you mind walking up to the house?&rdquo; Berkeley asked his companion, as he drew up  at the lodge. &ldquo;I want to take this beast round to the stables myself, and there  is not much time before dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  Mabel walked up the long drive by herself, while Berkeley went rapidly round to  the stables. There he did not linger for a moment; but after a hasty glance at  his watch took his way to a part of the grounds called the &ldquo;Shrubbery,&rdquo; which  was near the house, but could be approached by a circuitous path from the  stables. He entered the Shrubbery, and coming to a small clear space where  there was an old rough garden-seat beneath a solitary laurel, which had grown  to an unusual height, he stopped and looked round, as if expecting some one. At  the same instant a woman glided from behind the great laurel and came forward.  It was Lilian Elmer. She was wrapped in a dark waterproof cloak, but the shapeless  garment could not quite hide the grace of her figure, and through her thick  black veil the whiteness of her fair face appeared. No greeting passed between  the two, but Frere took a small, white, trembling hand in his, and held it as  he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  is he going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  was the answer. &ldquo;And are you to remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is all right then, if only you can keep up your spirits and your strength,  Lilian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Frere, I am so wretched. I feel as if I never could go through with it,&rdquo; sobbed  the unhappy woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lilian,  you have promised me. There can be no going back now?&rdquo; said Berkeley sternly,  and his tone calmed her at once. Lilian Elmer feared many things, but most of  all she feared Frere Berkeley&rsquo;s displeasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish the race was to come off two days earlier,&rdquo; said Frere, meditatively, as  he walked back to the stables, while the slight, darkly wrapped figure sped  away toward the house, through the gloom of the November evening.</p>
<p>It  was all arranged. For nearly three years Lilian Elmer had borne the ill-humor  and the worse usage of a detested husband, and often during that wretched time  she had struggled hard against her love for him who was not her husband, but  she had given way at last. The next few days were to see the end of her  bondage. Mr. Elmer was to be away on business for nearly a week, and his young  wife was to be left behind; and on the day of the grand steeplechase she was to  make her escape. When the race was over, and the party from Fairbank had  returned, she was to slip out again. Berkeley&rsquo;s servant would be waiting with  the dog-cart at a little distance from the house. He would drive her into  Barnston, where she would meet Frere, and they would then travel together to  London. This was now the sixteenth, and the race would not come off till the  twentieth. Three long days had to be lived through yet; three days more of  hypocrisy and deceit, during which she would have to appear calm and  indifferent, while Frere must keep up his role as Mabel Burniston&rsquo;s favored  lover.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;Now Nothing Left To Love Or Hate&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>As  Mabel entered the house that evening she was met by her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  here directly, Mabel,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I want to speak to you in my own room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mabel  followed her up-stairs and into her dressing-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo;  said Lady Wycherly, after hastily shutting the door, &ldquo;now I should very much  like to know what you mean, Mabel, by going out driving with that man this  afternoon, after what Douglas told you this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  Douglas came to you with his absurd story did he?&rdquo; said Mabel, smiling and  calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel,  you must be crazy!&rdquo; cried Lady Wycherly. &ldquo;Here have I been in a state of agony  all this afternoon, knowing this dreadful thing, and unable to imagine what is  to be done, and now you talk calmly of an &lsquo;absurd story!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am not crazy, my dear Mary, but I think poor Douglas is. The fact is, the boy  is mad with jealousy. He was determined to make mischief between me and Frere,  and so he raked up this story. I saw it all directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is impossible,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly, &ldquo;quite impossible that Douglas should  behave in such a manner. He believed what he said, I am sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,  but that does not make it true,&rdquo; retorted Mabel. &ldquo;I tell you it is all  nonsense, Mary,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Frere Berkeley as good as proposed to me this  afternoon, and I consider myself engaged to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  looked so happy and confident as she spoke that her sister could only believe  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well.&rdquo;  said Lady Wycherly, resignedly, &ldquo;I give it all up. Douglas comes to me this  morning with a most extraordinary story, and implores me to send you home at  once, or your name will be compromised, and all sorts of dreadful things will  happen. And you come to me this afternoon and tell me that you are engaged to  the very man I was to save you from. I really don&rsquo;t know what to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave  me to manage my own affairs, and don&rsquo;t listen to slanderous stories,&rdquo; said  Mabel, lightly, and she walked over to a mirror and began admiring the effect  of a pretty new hat she wore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I hardly think that Douglas would have spoken as he did unless he thought that  he had good reason,&rdquo; began Lady Wycherly again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody  has furbished up the old story, then&mdash;the story you told me when I first  came&mdash;and has been entertaining Douglas with it,&rdquo; said Mabel, quietly, as she  continued to admire her pretty face in the glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it was not the old story. It was Mr. Otway, who, it seems, had heard or seen  something, and who told Douglas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otway!&rdquo;  exclaimed Mabel, in a tone of supreme contempt. &ldquo;That little red-haired,  mischief-making snob is always finding some new wonderment; but no one but a  simpleton like Douglas would believe a word he said!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  Mabel went off, leaving her sister just sufficiently in doubt to prevent her  interfering further in the matter.</p>
<p>In  the drawing-room, after dinner that evening, Mabel and Frere Berkeley were  playing bezique. Sir George came up to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand  I have to congratulate you, Berkeley,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and as Miss Mabel must be  congratulated too, I suppose, thought I&rsquo;d get it both done at once, you know,  ha, ha! Bless you, my children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mabel  colored violently, and Frere looked up rather surprised, but he did not lose  his presence of mind for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you, Sir George. Very kind of you, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; he said, coolly. &ldquo;Many thanks&mdash;for  self and partner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha,  ha! &lsquo;Self and partner!&rsquo; Yes, yes, very good, ha, ha!&rdquo; chuckled Sir George, with  whom a small joke went a long way; and, as he spoke very loud, every one in the  room heard, and before that evening was over Mabel and Berkeley had been  congratulated on all sides.</p>
<p>Mabel  was inclined to be vexed at first. &ldquo;Why did you not contradict Sir George?&rdquo; she  whispered to Berkeley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should I?&rdquo; he whispered back, with the look and the smile that before this had  conquered Mabel&rsquo;s foolish, vain little heart; and after that she accepted the  position and her friends&rsquo; congratulations without protest.</p>
<p>For  the next three days Frere Berkeley openly took the place of Mabel Burniston&rsquo;s  accepted lover, and Mabel took no pains to conceal her joy and triumph. She was  very much in love and very proud of her lover, and she let every one see it.  She seized every opportunity of patronizing Lilian Elmer, who accepted the  situation without the least show of resentment, yet was evidently pained by it,  and avoided Mabel us much as possible.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  Tommy Otway kept his spectacles on and watched the play.</p>
<p>The  day of the race came. The morning was cloudy and there was a threatening of  rain; but, whether it rained or not, the ladies from Fairbank must be at the  race, and at twelve o&rsquo;clock they were preparing to start.</p>
<p>Mabel,  came down, dressed to perfection in a coquettish costume of black velvet and  green satin. Black and green were Frere&rsquo;s colors. She looked charmingly pretty,  and the little flutter of anxiety and excitement she was in about the race made  her only more fascinating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  our horse is sure to win, isn&rsquo;t he, Mr. Supple?&rdquo; she said, turning the light of  her blue eyes upon that young gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain,  if it were only to please you,&rdquo; stammered the gallant cornet.</p>
<p>Mabel  smiled graciously at him. Then she turned to Sir George Wycherly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  George, I hope it is not going to rain,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoil  your fine bonnet if it does, eh?&rdquo; said Sir George, &ldquo;Good-morning, Mrs. Elmer: I  see you are wise, you are prepared for rain.&rdquo; And the fussy old baronet eyed  with approval Mrs. Elmer&rsquo;s toilet. Her gown was of some thick, dark material,  very plainly made, and her bonnet was chosen to suit the gown. She looked pale  and nervous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is a very gloomy morning,&rdquo; she answered, with a little shiver, as she moved to  the window, and looked out on the gray, banked-up clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  and you ladies would have been far more comfortable in closed carriages, as I  said; only nobody ever listens to me,&rdquo; grumbled Sir George.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it is too late now, my dear,&rdquo; said his wife; &ldquo;the break&rsquo;s at the door; and we  had better start at once if we are to be there by one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was past one when they arrived at the course, and the horses were already being  cantered up to the starting-point. There were five horses. The first that  appeared was ridden by a jockey in a scarlet jacket; the next was blue; then a  yellow and a pink passed slowly along; and then, after a few moments&rsquo; delay,  the favorite appeared, a large, fiery-looking black horse, ridden by a green jacket  and a black velvet cap. Frere looked very pale, but the way he managed the  animal he rode was grace and ease itself. There was a pretty general cheer from  the crowd as he took his place with the others, and Mabel, standing up in the  carriage, clapped her hands enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  green&rsquo;s your color, isn&rsquo;t it, Miss Burniston?&rdquo; said an officer of dragoons, who  just then sauntered up to the Fairbank break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I am sure he will win,&rdquo; cried Mabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  odds are six to one on him; take you at six to one in gloves, if you like,&rdquo;  said the dragoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am quite ready,&rdquo; laughed Mabel, and some other men came round, and she was busy  arranging small bets till the bell rang.</p>
<p>Lilian  Elmer sat very still and quiet in her corner of the carriage, only when she  heard the shout which told they were &ldquo;off&rdquo; she looked up eagerly for a moment  as the colors flashed past, and her fair face crimsoned, and then grew pale as  before.</p>
<p>The  start had been good, and for a few moments the five horses went almost in a  line, then three drew ahead&mdash;the green, the yellow, and the pink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  does he let those two keep so close to him?&rdquo; said Mabel, impatiently; &ldquo;he could  leave them behind in a minute, if he chose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait  a bit, wait a bit,&rdquo; said Sir George; &ldquo;we shall see what he can do presently,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  shall see no more from this point,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly: &ldquo;let us drive down to  the end of the course and see the finish,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir  George gave the order, and they drove down and took up a position near the last  jump, a breakneck-looking place, being an unpleasant combination of bank,  hedge, and ditch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure  to be some pretty tumbles here, and a broken arm or leg or two,&rdquo; remarked Mr.  Otway, with a pleasant grin at Mabel. Mabel was standing up again and looking  earnestly through her glass. She took not the slightest notice of Mr. Otway&rsquo;s  observation, but Lilian Elmer turned paler than ever, and clasped her hands  tightly on the rail in front of her.</p>
<p>They  come on, only three now&mdash;the scarlet, the yellow, and the green, the other two  far behind. Green was leading, but scarlet was very close, yellow at some  little distance; over another fence they came, still in the same order. Then  came the water jump! Moloch cleared it gallantly, but the horse ridden by the  scarlet jacket came to dreadful grief; he slipped on the bank and rolled into  the stream, carrying his unlucky rider with him. Frere&rsquo;s friends gave a cheer,  and Mabel clapped her hands with delight as the green jacket was now seen  flying on alone and rapidly nearing the last jump, just beyond which was the  winning-post. They reached the place, but the great black horse, instead of  clearing it at once as he had the other fences, suddenly swerved aside, and for  a moment was quite beyond his rider&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound  it,&rdquo; exclaimed one of the men standing near the carriage, &ldquo;the beast&rsquo;s temper  has broken out just at the last moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  fear; Berkeley will manage him,&rdquo; said another.</p>
<p>The  yellow jacket coming along steadily behind saw his chance, and put on a  tremendous spurt; he was quite close when at last the black horse rose at the  jump. He rose, but, as if purposely, he failed to clear it; his hind legs  dropped and entangled themselves in the hedge, and horse and man fell heavily  together, the horse in his struggles rolling over and over his rider; and while  an excited crowd gathered round, and with some difficulty the struggling animal  was removed, bringing to view Frere Berkeley&rsquo;s prostrate and motionless figure,  the yellow jacket quietly trotted in and won the race.</p>
<p>Mabel  had seen the dreadful fall, and, giving a piercing scream, was about to spring  from the carriage, but Lilian Elmer was before her. In a second she had darted  through the crowd, and was at the fallen man&rsquo;s side. Raising his head on her  lap, and while her tears rained down on the insensible face, the poor woman,  regardless of the wonder of the bystanders, poured forth wild and incoherent words  of love and grief over the dead body of him for whom she had been about to  sacrifice everything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak  to me once more; oh, Frere, my darling, speak to me,&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>A  doctor came up, and she gave place to him, The examination did not occupy more  than a moment. The doctor turned to the bystanders and said quietly: &ldquo;He will  never speak again; his neck is broken. Death must have been almost instantaneous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lilian  Elmer heard, and with a faint, despairing cry once more threw herself on her  knees beside the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is the lady?&rdquo; asked the doctor; &ldquo;wife, sister&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is not his sister, and she is somebody else&rsquo;s wife, and the girl he is engaged  to is sitting in that carriage there,&rdquo; whispered some one to the medical  gentleman, and somehow the story spread, and presently there was a staring  crowd round the Fairbank carriage, where Mabel sat slowly recovering from a  dead faint. When, thrusting her aside, Lilian Elmer had rushed to the scene of  the accident, Mabel, without having time to think or wonder, was about to  follow her, but Lady Wycherly laid a restraining hand on her sister&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me go to him, Mary,&rdquo; exclaimed Mabel. &ldquo;Look! she has his head on her lap, she  is taking my place. What does she mean by it?&mdash;what does it all mean?&rdquo; she  cried, astonished and indignant, and once more she made an attempt to leave the  carriage.</p>
<p>Her  sister caught her dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mabel,  for Heaven&rsquo;s sake control yourself,&rdquo; she said, earnestly. &ldquo;It is bad enough as  it is, but if you cannot keep calm it will be much worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  does it all mean?&rdquo; asked Mabel again, in a bewildered tone.</p>
<p>She  was very pale, and was supporting herself with difficulty by the side rail of  the carriage, as she still kept her eyes fixed on the group assembled close by  the fatal last fence.</p>
<p>No  one could look upon the frantic grief of the poor woman who was the center  figure of that group, and doubt what it all meant to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  poor Mab,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly, &ldquo;I am afraid it means that Douglas was right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  then Mabel fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  are all these dreadful people?&rdquo; she whispered, when she came to herself and saw  the mob round the carriage. &ldquo;Oh, Mary, take me away, take me home quick! don&rsquo;t  let any one see me!&rdquo; she said imploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear, directly. Supple has gone to see if he can get us a close  carriage.&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  any carriage, only let us get away this instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  then the young cornet came up with a brougham he had managed to borrow. With a  very serious face he helped the ladies in, shut the door, and gave the coachman  his orders. No wonder Cornet Supple looked grave. Not only was he in the midst  of a tragedy of real life, but he had lost a good deal of money.</p>
<p>During  the first part of that drive home Mabel seemed in a sort of stupor, but  presently she roused herself, and asked slowly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  he dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  poor fellow, he is dead,&rdquo; answered Mary Wycherly, gently.</p>
<p>Then  Mabel began to cry hysterically, and this lasted not only till they reached  home, but all the evening afterward. Lady Wycherly dismissed the maid, and  waited on her sister herself. She brought her some tea and sandwiches after she  had undressed her, and made her go to bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  Mabel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you must eat and drink, or you will be seriously ill, and I  shall have to bring the doctor to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  let any one come near me,&rdquo; cried Mabel, burying her face in the pillows; &ldquo;I  shall never be able to face any one again as long as I live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  nonsense! you have done nothing wrong,&rdquo; said her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to think that I should be treated so,&rdquo; sobbed the poor beauty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is the mortification she feels most,&rdquo; said Lady Wycherly to her husband that  night, when Mabel having at last fallen asleep, she had left her to the care of  her maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  that would be so,&rdquo; said Sir George, adding: &ldquo;By Heaven! I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t soon forget  the agony of that other woman. I can see her now, clinging to the body as they  put it on a stretcher to carry it away. It was awful!&rdquo; and the stout baronet,  who was not given to emotion, fairly shuddered.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was an awful affair, and caused some sensation at the time, I can tell you,&rdquo;  said Cornet, now Captain, Supple, telling the story two or three years  afterward; &ldquo;and what made it worse, as far as the talk went, was the way that  old fool Elmer behaved. Instead of keeping it quiet, you know, he told  everybody how his wife was about to elope with Berkeley the very day he was  killed, showed lots of people the letter the poor thing had left for him, and  which it seems he got a day earlier than was intended, for he happened to come  back from London that same day. All through he behaved like a cad as he is,  and, of course, that made it all the more unpleasant for Mabel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Served  her quite right,&rdquo; growled Otway, who was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; said Supple; &ldquo;but it cured her of flirting, at any  rate. She felt it very much, her mother took her abroad, and she only came back  a few months since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now she&rsquo;s married,&rdquo; remarked another man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  to an elderly widower with half a dozen children. Queer end for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  queerer than the end of some other &lsquo;belles of the season&rsquo; that I have known,&rdquo;  said Otway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  became of the other woman, did you say?&rdquo; asked another of Supple&rsquo;s listeners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  she died; poor thing; fell into a decline, and died in less than a year after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best  thing she could do,&rdquo; said Otway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter with you to-night, Tommy?&rdquo; asked Supple, pleasantly. &ldquo;You are more  spiteful even than usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going to a wedding to-morrow, perhaps that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said Otway, with a grin. </p>
<p>&ldquo;A  wedding!&mdash;whose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Douglas  M&rsquo;Kenzie&rsquo;s,&rdquo; replied Otway, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  yes,&rdquo; said Supple, &ldquo;remember now hearing he was about to take the fatal step.  Why didn&rsquo;t he marry his cousin after all, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t  such a fool,&rdquo; observed Mr. Otway, with much meaning; and the others laughed as  he walked off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&rsquo;TWAS  Christmas Eve, and the lamps were lit<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the snow fell thick and fast,<br>
  And the wayfarers in the London streets<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shivered as they went past;<br>
  And they thought of the cheery blaze at home<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the well-spread table there,<br>
  And the happy faces that make sweet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the homeliest fare.<br>
  She sat in a garret, pallid and wan,<br>
  And her face it was fair to look upon,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its patient loveliness.</p>
<p>She  had numbered but some twenty years,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the hair had streaks of gray,<br>
  And her face was furrowed with the tears<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had shed for many a day.<br>
  Poor girl! poor child! &rsquo;tis to many given<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To taste of life&rsquo;s sweet wine,<br>
  But we know&mdash;and so doth a pitying Heaven&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the dregs alone are thine.<br>
  Think of it, ye who have lands and gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet would grind the starving poor,<br>
  Who would care not if they be hungry and cold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But would turn them out at the door;<br>
  Think how they suffer, and how their lot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must ever a hard one be;<br>
  Think of it, think of it, give to them<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A trifling penny fee;<br>
  It will blessing bring to ye thus employed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Heaven wills thus its use;<br>
  It will bring ye twentyfold increase,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the oil in the widow&rsquo;s cruse.</p>
<p>The  seamstress sits with a yearning look<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On her face, and she sometimes sighs,<br>
  Yet never stays she from her work,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save to wipe the tears from her eyes.<br>
  Is she thinking now how her father died,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Struck down in his manhood&rsquo;s prime?<br>
  Does she live again in the dear old days<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of her childhood&rsquo;s happy time?<br>
  Is she thinking now of the rectory vines,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the roots of the old elm-tree,<br>
  Of the lilies white upon the porch?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, well! such things may be<br>
  Too dear, too sacred far for words,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those thoughts of the bygone years,<br>
  But the inmost depths of the heart they stir,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till it finds relief in tears.</p>
<p>The  snow fell fast, and the biting wind<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrestled, and blustered, and blew<br>
  In its spiteful wrath, till at last, with a gust,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open the casement flew.<br>
  Yet in spite of the wind and the falling snow<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were angels then abroad;<br>
  Angels, although of mortal clay,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True servants of their Lord.</p>
<p>There  was <em>one</em>, at least, who the weather  braved&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night, and who left her ease,<br>
  With a noble heart and a well-filled purse<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To &ldquo;minister unto these.&rdquo;<br>
  For she knew full well, did that gentle girl&mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That lady of high degree&mdash;<br>
  <em>Who</em> hath said, &ldquo;If ye do it unto  these,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye do it unto ME.&rdquo;<br>
  A light tap comes at the crazy door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the seamstress lifts her eyes;<br>
  Such a vision as that must surely be<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A vision from the skies!</p>
<p>Velvet  and sable and costly lace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satin and shimmering silk,<br>
  A face as fair as the rosy dawn,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a heart as white as milk.<br>
  They are sisters. Heaven, thy mysteries<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What human glass can show?<br>
  We  are brothers and sisters (or should be) all<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this pitiful world below.</p>
<p>Soft  and silvery, soft and low,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come the gentle, loving words,<br>
  In tones so mellow and clear and sweet<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That they might have been a bird&rsquo;s:<br>
  &ldquo;Poor girl! I have heard of your spirit brave,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of your soul, so steadfast and true;<br>
  I have come to cheer you, dear, with these words,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to help and succor you.<br>
  They tell me you are alone&mdash;alone:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take comfort, dear&mdash;not so;<br>
  If man fall off, there is always God<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who cares for us all below.<br>
  Take this&mdash;hush!&mdash;weep no more, my dear,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or I shall have spoken in vain;<br>
  Take this, take this. I will come to you<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a day or two again.&rdquo;<br>
  The fair girl bends, and her noble face<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You would think transfigured now,<br>
  As she pressed a kiss, with a sister&rsquo;s grace,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the poor young seamstress&rsquo; brow;<br>
  And something chinks in the starved girl&rsquo;s hand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And she rises quick from her seat;<br>
  So weak, so weak, she can scarcely stand,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the ground quakes under her feet,<br>
  But the &ldquo;Good Samaritan&rdquo; has gone,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the room seems lonely and drear,<br>
  Though it shone with a halo of light and love<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the while that she was here.<br>
  Then the seamstress raises her poor thin hands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the tears drop fast from her eyes;<br>
  On her knees she falls, and she kisses the spot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where stood one so good and wise.<br>
  Her head low bowed on her close-locked hands,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her face with the tear-dew wet;<br>
  She murmurs forth from her grateful heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;O God! there are angels yet!&rdquo;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="TheLongmoneyConspiracy"></a>The Longmoney Conspiracy</strong></h1>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1<br>
  Nurse Makes Up Her Mind</strong></h2>
<p>At Longmoney Hall, a handsome mansion on the borders of Middlesex and Herts, there  lived seven sisters. Not by themselves exactly, because they had a father and  mother, the former of whom was the owner of the house, and of the estate  belonging to it, who bore all the expenses of the establishment, and might  therefore be considered as its head. But in a sense they did live by  themselves, forming within the household a kind of free republic, owning a  certain allegiance to, but not amenable to, all the laws of the empire about  them.</p>
<p>The  eldest of these girls, and the head of the republic, was Mirabel, who was just  eighteen. The youngest was Amy, and she was only seven. Mirabel was tall and  lithe and fair, with auburn hair and brown eyes, and a sweet, expressive mouth.  She naturally assumed a kind of authority over her sisters, as she had been out  ever since last winter, and had even had a love affair, although it had not  developed itself satisfactorily. This was with young Dunwal Mellon, the eldest  son of a neighboring squire; and it had gone on very smoothly at first; indeed  in such a regular, humdrum way as slightly to incite the contempt of the  schoolroom. It appeared, however, by and by, that there was an obstacle in the  way, and then the result became delightfully interesting&mdash;all the more that only  the echoes of rumors reached the schoolroom, leaving a delightfully open scope  for surmise and conjecture. Even Mirabel did not fully know the reasons that  induced her father to forbid any continuance of the affair. There had been  interviews and discussions without end about it among the old people, as they  were called in the schoolroom, but it ended at last in this way: There were to  be no visits, no letters, no engagement, and Dunwal was going abroad for a  year.</p>
<p>The  two young people, however, declared that in spite of all this they should  consider themselves bound to each other. Which view of the matter was  pooh-poohed by the elders, who, however, as thought is proverbially free, were  unable to traverse it effectually, and could only say that the thing was quite  impossible, wrong, and very absurd.</p>
<p>That  was not the schoolroom opinion of the matter, you may be sure. There, Mirabel  took rank at once as a heroine; sympathy flowed freely for her, and her  influence over her sisters was much increased.</p>
<p>Marmaduke  Glossop, the father of these young people, was a man not quite fifty years old,  something of an invalid, and rather soured in temper. His wife was younger, but  still nearly forty, a healthy, placid woman, amiable and devout, with a fund of  natural cheerfulness that was pleasant to witness, but that hardly infected her  companions. She performed all her duties with praiseworthy regularity. Such a  time with the housekeeper, such a time in the schoolroom, so long for visits,  so many hours devoted to the poor. It was fortunate for Mrs. Glossop that she  had so great a power of arranging and making use of her time; else she would  have been fidgeted to death by her husband. He was a man of the highest  character, and of considerable attainments; but was principally known in his  household as a &ldquo;worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Mr. and Mrs. Glossop were only the nominal rulers of the house. The real acting  potentates were Nurse and Grundy. Nurse ruled through the wife, and Grundy by  means of the husband.</p>
<p>Grundy  had been in the house in Mr. Glossop&rsquo;s father&rsquo;s time, and was deeply attached  to the &ldquo;family.&rdquo; Nurse had come into the establishment with Mrs. Glossop, and  was devoted to the &ldquo;children.&rdquo; Grundy was short and slight, with a deeply  pockmarked face, and sunken, meaningless eyes. Nurse was a Cumberland woman,  tall and hard-featured, with something of a burr in her voice.</p>
<p>Marmaduke  Glossop had one brother, the rector of a parish in Kent. They were on tolerably  good terms, but they did not see much of one another, and there was no great  affection subsisting between them.</p>
<p>Picture  to yourself a large white house standing on a gentle slope, a wood behind it,  facing to the west. In front of it stretches a goodly park, well timbered, and  of pleasant contour. The front of the house is occupied by the apartments of  state. The schoolroom, nursery, and girls&rsquo; rooms are at the side facing to the  north. The south and sunny side is taken up by the private rooms of Mr. and  Mrs. Glossop; and here are the gardens and hothouses, and all the warmth and  color of the place.</p>
<p>Here  Mr. Glossop spent the most of his time. He sketched a little; he wrote a little  tolerable prose, and intolerable poetry; thought himself vastly superior to his  destiny, but had never seen his way to alter it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you know, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Glossop to his wife, one bright morning in June,  &ldquo;that I think it will be absolutely necessary for us to winter in Italy. I&rsquo;ve  written, in fact, to Hobegond to put the place into some agent&rsquo;s hands to let  for six months, or twelve, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; said Mrs. Glossop&mdash;with a rising color, and even the suspicion of  tartness in her voice; but you will observe that when excited her voice lowers  rather than rises in pitch&mdash;&ldquo;that you might have consulted <em>me</em> before you had taken any steps in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  I should, I dare say,&rdquo; said Glossop, &ldquo;but you weren&rsquo;t at home to consult: you  can&rsquo;t have things all ways, you know. You can&rsquo;t be going about visiting your  relations, and yet be consulted about things going on at home too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know very well, Marmaduke,&rdquo; said Mrs. Glossop, &ldquo;that it was only my sister&rsquo;s  illness&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, I don&rsquo;t say anything about that,&rdquo; interrupted Glossop. &ldquo;Sister or not  doesn&rsquo;t make any difference; there&rsquo;s the fact. Mind, I&rsquo;m not blaming you, or  casting any reflections. I only state a fact. You weren&rsquo;t at home, never mind  why,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  couldn&rsquo;t you have waited till I did come home?&rdquo; said Mrs. Glossop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  health,&rdquo; cried Mr. Glossop; &ldquo;consider my health. Grundy tells me he distinctly  hears an inspiratory murmur as he fastens my flannel waistcoat. I don&rsquo;t wish to  act unkindly, but there is one paramount consideration&mdash;health&mdash;my health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But <em>my</em> health, too, Marmaduke, requires a  little consideration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  looked at his wife an amazement. &ldquo;Isabella never has anything the matter with  her,&rdquo; he thought. Then a sudden idea seized him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  bless my soul! Is it so?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Glossop nodded, and blushed.</p>
<p>Marmaduke  presently made his way to the library and rang for Grundy, The orders were  countermanded for letting the house. The family would winter in England.</p>
<p>Nurse  was radiant when she heard this. She hated foreign parts, and she presently  waylaid her mistress to congratulate her on the decision. But after she had  seen Mrs. Glossop she wasn&rsquo;t nearly so well satisfied. She walked about the  nursery cracking her knuckles and groaning in great anguish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  my young leddies! oh, my young leddies! whatever will become of ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now  the expected event that had caused all this pother, was, as you may have  guessed, the probable arrival of either another heiress to the Longmoney  estate, or of a male heir to be the engrosser of it all.</p>
<p>Now,  the first possibility was not a disastrous one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was a very great bother beginning having babies when you&rsquo;d left off and  everything was comfortably settled,&rdquo; said nurse to herself.</p>
<p>But,  after all, whether you divide seven thousand a year by seven or eight, the  quotient is a very respectable sum for a girl. But if it were a boy, oh, then  it would be ruin for the girls and their prospects. Only five thousand pounds  could be raised, under the marriage settlements to portion off the girls; a sum  absolutely ridiculous, but that all the parties to the settlement were crazy on  the subject of keeping up the estate, except, indeed, the bride, who had been  brought up in almost conventual simplicity, and who thought that those who were  about her could do the best for the interest of all concerned, without her  being required to master the contents of those very crabbed and unpleasantly  outspoken law-papers.</p>
<p>So  that nobody realized but nurse what there really was depending on this event.</p>
<p>Nurse  knew very well why Mirabel had not been permitted to engage herself to young  Mellon. Squire Mellon had insisted that if the young people married a suitable  portion in land should be settled upon his daughter by Glossop. Mr. Glossop had  decidedly objected to entertain the proposal. At his death, he said, Mirabel  would be a co-heiress to the whole estate. He would not anticipate that event,  nor would he make any alteration in the settlement of the estate, even were it  in his power to do it.</p>
<p>Now  all this would come right in time if things went on as they had done. Every  year put the chances that the girls would eventually be the heiresses to the  estate on a better footing. But if now, at the last moment, a young heir came  into the world, and the girls were to find themselves almost portionless, what  chance would there be of their gaining good settlements among the proudest of  the land, as nurse had always secretly prophesied that they would?</p>
<p>There  was Grundy, too, so cock-a-hoop about it. There had always been pitched battles  between nurse and him on this very subject. Grundy was constantly vaunting the  dignity of the Glossops. What a fine family it had been! What a pity that it  should be lost among a lot of girls! Nurse had, on the contrary, constantly  upheld the superiority of girls over boys, and had gloried in the fact that all  her young ladies would have property of their own, and would eventually  distribute the Longmoney acres over half a dozen good families in the county.</p>
<p>Now,  nurse was almost driven to her wits&rsquo; end, and what made it harder to bear was  that master and that Grundy were so silly about it.</p>
<p>Mr.  Glossop, indeed, had found quite a new life in the excitement of the possible  advent of an heir. It had always been a trouble to him that his wife gave him  only daughters, a trouble which, as it did not interfere with his personal  comfort, he had borne meekly and with submission. But now he was elevated  beyond measure. That Providence was favorable to long-settled estates he had  not the slightest doubt. It was not likely that Providence would tantalize him  with newly awakened hope, merely to deceive him at last. No, he was certain  that he should have a son this time.</p>
<p>But  nurse was resolved that he shouldn&rsquo;t, if she could help it. She wouldn&rsquo;t see  those poor girls cheated out of their birthright for some puling little baby  that nobody knew anything about. &ldquo;It shouldn&rsquo;t be,&rdquo; she said to herself; but  how to help it she didn&rsquo;t know.</p>

  &ldquo;Nobody Can Find The Deed&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Henry  Glossop, the brother of Marmaduke, was the rector of Whetham, Kent. There is a  station called Whetham on the line, whether South-Eastern or London, Chatham,  and Dover does not matter. He was not a very clerical man: broad-shouldered,  rough, rather like a grazier or a wealthy cattle-dealer than a clergyman. He  had a moderately good living, a tiny wife, and seven huge sons, strapping  youths, with inordinate appetites, and small capacity for anything but mischief  and fun. Henry himself was only a grown-up boy, with nothing to play at. He had  some amiable qualities that would have made him agreeable as a country  gentleman with a good rent-roll. As a clergyman, struggling with circumstances,  and much behind-hand in the world, he felt that life was a failure; but he had  sufficient good-humor to prevent him from feeling it acutely. But in his darker  moods he often brooded discontentedly over the contrast betwixt his brother&rsquo;s  lot and his own. He felt, too, as if he had suffered a certain wrong in the  matter, and, indeed, from his point of view there was something to support that  idea. The Longmoney estate had always been settled strictly on the male line,  but on his brother&rsquo;s marriage the entail had been barred, so it was believed,  and the estate resettled on the issue of the marriage, to the eldest son, if  there were a son, or, failing male issue, equally among the females. Henry  Glossop had always called this a swindle. &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Marmaduke,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;who  comes in for this estate as the result of a certain mode of inheritance; he  takes advantage of it to collar all the estate, and then throws the principle  overboard and chouses me out of my rights. There&rsquo;s law for it, no doubt. But it  is not justice. Let us stick to the hereditary principle, but let us work it  fairly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry  felt too that the estate would fare much better in his hands than in his  brother&rsquo;s. Marmaduke was a poor, weak fellow, who enjoyed nothing, and would  bring the name of Glossop, as one belonging to the untitled aristocracy, to an  untimely end. There would still be Glossops, representatives of the family; &ldquo;but  they would be lawyers&rsquo; clerks, tradesmen, cab-drivers even, very likely,&rdquo; cried  Henry, bitterly. &ldquo;That is about all I can afford to make of them.&rdquo; And these  gathered-together acres, acquired to support the name of Glossop, would go to  increase the wealth and influence of other families.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here  am I,&rdquo; Henry would say, &ldquo;fond of field sports, of society, of country life,  with seven boys and seven hundred a year; and there&rsquo;s Marmaduke, with his head  always moping about his books, and his verses and faddle, who hasn&rsquo;t pluck  enough to cross a horse&rsquo;s back, with seven puling girls, and seven thousand a  year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Providence  was not just, although it was his official duty to make out that it was.</p>
<p>Henry  Glossop was a good deal in London. He often had business there, chiefly  connected with raising money. He loved to lounge about Tattersall&rsquo;s and the  smoking-room of his club; he delighted to throw off his clerical character, and  to wear a blue bird&rsquo;s-eye necktie and a white hat with a black band round it,  and clothes cut rather after the fashion of Newmarket than of the apostles. He  was very often at the offices of Hobegond &amp; Shortwater, the solicitors,  Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. Hobegonds had been the family lawyers for a long time, and old  Hobegond took sufficient interest in Henry to try to keep his affairs in some  kind of order. He would lend him money sometimes, taking care that Henry  insured his life for twice the amount of the principal borrowed; so that in  this way he had induced him to make quite a respectable provision for his  family; but there was terrible work to get the premiums paid, and altogether  Hobegond had an amount of trouble in the matter that he would not have taken  for anybody but a Glossop.</p>
<p>On  one occasion, when Henry was at Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, Hobegond produced a deed  engrossed on parchment, and placing it before Henry, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  a conveyance we want you to sign. It&rsquo;s of a plot of land wanted by the Midland,  and these railway people are so niggling in their requisitions that they  require everybody to join in these conveyances who in the remotest way might  ever have an interest in the matter. It&rsquo;s a mere matter of form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Henry Glossop pushed his chair away from the table, and refused the proffered  pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have always understood that my rights had been extinguished  altogether; and if that&rsquo;s the case there can be no possible reason why I should  sign this deed. And if it should turn out that I have any rights, it isn&rsquo;t  likely that I should sign &rsquo;em away for my brother&rsquo;s advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  very well,&rdquo; said Hobegond, carelessly. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter; we can do very well  without you;&rdquo; but he spoke very stiffly to Mr. Henry after that about sundry  outstanding liabilities, and the latter saw pretty clearly that Hobegond was  vexed at his refusal.</p>
<p>Henry  pondered over this a good deal. It gave him a feeling of hope and expectation  to imagine that there was some possible outlet for him&mdash;some prospect for the future.  Like most men who go lurching through the world with a grievance, he was not  very scrupulous in dealing with anybody whom he looked upon as having wronged  him. His brother Marmaduke wrote him a sharp letter on the subject of his  refusal to sign the formal deed, and Henry had replied with one equally  plain-spoken. &ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t owe the fellow anything.&rdquo; And that  was to be accounted for by the fact that Marmaduke had persistently refused to  lend him any money. It was a family principle, Marmaduke said on one occasion,  never to lend money to the younger branches.</p>
<p>Henry  Glossop had a faculty for investigation and detection which would probably have  raised him to a very high position in the police force had his fate assigned to  him that sphere of labor. He would rummage and ransack with indefatigable  perseverance till he found out what he wanted. He was entirely without personal  hauteur, and would talk and gossip with anybody, and was just as ready to smoke  a pipe with a costermonger as with a duke. And this habit of questioning  everybody and everything had given him a good deal of varied information,  mostly useless. He was not long, consequently, in finding out all about the  railway company and the Longmoney estate. They had wanted to purchase a large  plot of land to erect a depot, and their lawyer had made some objection to the  title, and that had led to his being asked to join in the conveyance.</p>
<p>Henry  was very popular with Hobegond&rsquo;s articled clerks, and with young Hobegond  himself, who was quite a different man from his father, and rather inclined to  be horsey. One of the young Glossops was articled at Hobegond&rsquo;s too, and when  Hobegond and Shortwater were out of the way, there were often high jinks going  on up-stairs. Pots of stout were smuggled up aloft, short pipes were smoked,  whist was even known to have been played. In these diversions Henry was often  affably disposed to join, and sometimes, when he was in funds, he would treat  these jolly young gentlemen in a very handsome manner.</p>
<p>On  one of these festive occasions Henry accidentally got the clew he wanted; he  found out who investigated the Longmoney title.</p>
<p>This  was a very clever, dissipated fellow, named Dewsbury, who was noted for his  capacity for getting through work, and was the right-hand man of the  high-pressure firm who did the legal business of the eminent contractors,  Plusby &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Henry  Glossop laid himself out to cultivate the friendship of this Mr. Dewsbury. He  found out the tavern he frequented, and took his glass there constantly when he  was in town, and making his acquaintance, apparently by accident, they found  each other&rsquo;s conversation so agreeable that Glossop invited him to spend the  following Sunday at the rectory. Dewsbury was a gentlemanly fellow, who had  taken high honors at Cambridge, but who had disgusted all his friends by his  intemperate habits. At Whetham, however, he was on his good behavior and made  himself very agreeable.</p>
<p>The  rector had good wine in his cellars, wine being a commodity it is not difficult  to get on credit, and after dinner they adjourned to the lawn to finish a  bottle of Madeira and smoke a cigar. And here the Rev. Mr. Glossop adroitly led  the conversation to legal topics, to matters of title, and so on. And Dewsbury,  whose tongue was loosened by the wine he had drunk, talked freely on the  matter. Among other things he told how adroitly he had put his finger on a blot  upon the title of a large estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was an investigation I undertook for Plusby &amp; Co., our great clients, and  was for the purchase of a considerable plot of land. But I&rsquo;m boring you with my  shoppy talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  at all,&rdquo; cried Henry, leaning eagerly forward, &ldquo;not in the least. I delight in  these stories of legal experience. Go on, pray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I forget the name of the people the estate belonged to, and I shouldn&rsquo;t tell  you, of course, if I knew; but the thing being upon a marriage settlement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hi!  Father!&rdquo; shouted a voice from the drawing-room window, &ldquo;mother wants you to  come and have some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!  we&rsquo;d better obey Mrs. Glossop&rsquo;s behests,&rdquo; cried Dewsbury, rising a little  unsteadily to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit,&rdquo; cried the rector. &ldquo;Sit down and finish the bottle; go on&mdash;it was a  marriage settlement, you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  I remember well, it would have been right enough if they&rsquo;d extinguished all the  interests first&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t; or, if they did, nobody can find the deed.  Here was the owner of an estate assigning a property he didn&rsquo;t possess, simply  because he hadn&rsquo;t &mdash; or his lawyer hadn&rsquo;t, rather &mdash;taken the simple precaution  to extinguish existing rights. Such lawyers ought to be hung, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  they ought,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  isn&rsquo;t likely that anybody will be the sufferer in this case; but suppose, for  instance, that a case occurs in which the original settlement revives, and  these poor creatures who&rsquo;ve been hugging themselves in the idea that they are  heiresses&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  poor creatures,&rdquo; said Mr. Glossop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  wouldn&rsquo;t it be pitiable that they should be ousted out of the property they&rsquo;ve  lived upon, and grown up to consider their own, all for some stupid lawyer&rsquo;s  blunder? Hang such lawyers, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  all my heart,&rdquo; cried Mr. Glossop. &ldquo;Hang &rsquo;em all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  from that time Mr. Glossop was an altered man. He seemed to have taken a new  lease of life. Troubles that had weighed him down before now fell from him like  water from a duck&rsquo;s back. These things were for a time, but at some time or  other he would be master of Longmoney Hall.</p>
<p>How  often he planned it all out. The rooms he would occupy at the Hall&mdash;the horses  he would keep&mdash;the yacht he would have. How he would restock all the streams  with trout, and make the Longmoney estate worth shooting over. There would be  good grousing, too, on the hills, if the place were properly looked after.</p>
<p>And  how much better for the estate it would be to have an energetic resident  proprietor, instead of being parceled out among a lot of girls. Of course, they  would be disappointed; but what of that! Women should be educated to bear  disappointments: they were their appointed lot in life.</p>
<p>Nothing  could be done, of course, till Marmaduke&rsquo;s death; but that could not be very  far off. His lungs were all gone to pieces; he owned himself that he had a hole  through one as big as a cheese-plate.</p>
<p>Henry  Glossop often heard news of the Longmoney household. Marmaduke&rsquo;s man, Grundy, and  Henry&rsquo;s factotum were friends and correspondents. The news of the expected  event at the Hall was not long before it found its way down to the rectory.</p>
<p>It  had a powerful effect upon Henry. To see all his dreams shattered, his chances  all gone, his forecastings of an enjoyable existence all falsified. Nothing  left for him but a sordid kind of struggle with genteel penury. He felt as if  the news would choke him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course, it&rsquo;ll be a boy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t be my luck if it weren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3<br>
  A Flaw In The Settlement</strong></h2>
<p>Mrs.  Glossop was one of the kindest-hearted souls breathing. There was nothing she  would not do for the sake of any one in trouble; and she hated nothing except  ill-will. It was a real grief to her that Marmaduke and his brother had  quarreled, She blamed herself for it, not knowing the rights of the case, for  Glossop never confided business matters to his wife. She had not been so  attentive to this Henry Glossop as she ought to have been; she ought to have  had the boys down, only they were so rough and troublesome. In some ways she  was in fault, and she could not rest till she had made it up.</p>
<p>Marmaduke  was very well contented to be on bad terms with Henry. He had come to an age  when, perhaps, the delight of a quarrel and a grievance outweighs the  disagreeable feeling that somebody thinks ill of you. He was very cold on the  subject.</p>
<p>But  Mrs. Glossop, who was very low and nervous, poor thing, would not let the  matter rest,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  mayn&rsquo;t be with you much longer, Marmaduke,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;let me see you  reconciled with Henry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  grumbled, but at last wrote a sort of friendly letter to his brother, asking  him to come down and have a few days&rsquo; shooting.</p>
<p>Henry  was about to write off a curt note of refusal, but he reconsidered the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  tell you what,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no villainy these people wouldn&rsquo;t be guilty  of to keep me out of my rights. I will go down there, and look after my own  interests, and see how the land lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>November  saw Henry Glossop on a visit at the Hall. Nobody enjoyed his society much. Even  the girls in the schoolroom, to whom their uncle&rsquo;s visit brought a half-holiday  or two, declared that they had rather be in the schoolroom than with Uncle  Henry.</p>
<p>The  only person in the house who seemed to get on with him was nurse; and that was  strange enough, for she had always disliked him. But now, when he came in from  shooting, he would stalk into the nursery in his leggings and moleskins, and  sit down by the nursery fire and chat with nurse. Nurse had that room pretty  much to herself now. The children were mostly in the schoolroom, and the elders  had a little sitting-room to themselves, leading out of it, so that the nursery  had come to be regarded as nurse&rsquo;s private chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a pity we can&rsquo;t change, nurse,&rdquo; he said, one night, &ldquo;my seven boys for your  seven girls. They&rsquo;re no use to me, and here they&rsquo;d be invaluable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  but no, Mr. Henry,&rdquo; nurse exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d a deal rather keep the young leddies,  God bless &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  creatures,&rdquo; said Henry; &ldquo;I feel for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what for, Mr. Henry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  laddie that&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;you  think so!&rdquo; she cried eagerly. &ldquo;Eh. but it makes my heart sore to think of it;  but it&rsquo;s coming, sure enow! What will we do, Mr. Henry? I&rsquo;d dee for the young  leddies if I could save them from this trouble!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  easy enough,&rdquo; said Henry, casting a glance around him, to assure himself there  was nobody in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean, Mr. Henry?&rdquo; cried nurse, turning pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  it&rsquo;s done every day&mdash;when great interests depend upon it. What&rsquo;s a baby? It  makes no difference to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;  cried nurse, aghast, as though some evil spirit were putting her unavowed  thoughts into words, &ldquo;ye dinna mean&mdash; murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!  nonsense, what are you thinking about?&rdquo; and Henry really staggered at the  thought that he should have been thus misunderstood. &ldquo;No, no, Heaven forbid.  But look here, nurse. There are lots of babies born every day, and girls as  well as boys, and one might be changed for the other. Bless you, it&rsquo;s done  every day. Mind, I wouldn&rsquo;t sanction such a thing for the world; but still it&rsquo;s  quite possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  how,&rdquo; cried nurse, &ldquo;how could it be done? That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been puzzling me so  sadly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  yet you north-country people are generally called clever,&rdquo; said Henry. &ldquo;By  Jove! Well now, look here, nurse, I&rsquo;ll just show you&mdash;just for fun&mdash;how, if  anybody were so kicked as to plan such a thing, they could carry it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry  drew his chair up close to nurse, and began to talk in a low tone, while she  listened with breathless attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything  can be done for money, you see,&rdquo; he said at last, in a loud, cheerful voice,  rising to go away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo;  cried nurse to herself, as he went out. &ldquo;Ay, it&rsquo;s well I&rsquo;ve laid by a bit of  siller. I&rsquo;ll spend it every penny for my darlings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just  as the dressing-bell rang a fly drove up to the door, and Hobegond the lawyer  sprung out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  your master at home?&rdquo; he cried to Grundy, who came to see who the new arrival  might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  it&rsquo;s Mr. Hobegond. Yes, he is, sir, and I&rsquo;ll tell him you&rsquo;re here. You&rsquo;ll stop  the night, sir, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so, Grundy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell your master it&rsquo;s nothing very  important, but still I want to see him alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo,  Hobegond!&rdquo; cried Marmaduke, who received him in his dressing-room, &ldquo;what brings  you here in such a hurry? You&rsquo;ll stay dinner, of course, and the night? Grundy,  ask Mrs. Brown if Mr. Hobegond can have his old room. Will your news keep till  after dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  just talk it over to you while you&rsquo;re dressing,&rdquo; said Hobegond, sitting down by  the fire and rubbing his hands. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t much, perhaps, but I thought it  better to see you than to write. It&rsquo;s that railway business again. I&rsquo;ve had a  notice that the company mean to take possession and bring the purchase-money  into court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,  take my land!&rdquo; cried Marmaduke, &ldquo;and before they&rsquo;ve paid me for it! There&rsquo;s no  law so base, notwithstanding these democratic, these infidel times; there can  be no law to sanction such&mdash;such immorality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am afraid they know what they&rsquo;re about. I&rsquo;m afraid the Land Clauses  Consolidation Acts give them that power. You see, they objected to our title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you said yourself the objection was frivolous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I&rsquo;ve been looking into the matter since, and I&rsquo;m rather afraid that they have  hit a blot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  infamous!&rdquo; cried Marmaduke, stalking about the room, &ldquo;infamous! These public  companies going about and peering into land-owners&rsquo; title-deeds; hang it,  Hobegond, it&rsquo;s worse than the Inquisition. Where are our liberties that your  radical friends are prating about? Eh, Hobegond?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  that&rsquo;s true; but what I want to know is, how we are to mend the matter. I can&rsquo;t  conceal from you that, at your death, which must in the course of nature occur  sooner or later&mdash;let&rsquo;s hope it may be a long while first&mdash;if your brother Henry  were by any means advised of the nature of the flaw in your settlement, he  might, very probably&mdash;I don&rsquo;t say necessarily&mdash;but he might upset it, and  establish the old settlement, under which he inherits after you, failing male  issue to you. It&rsquo;s a very nice case,&rdquo; cried the lawyer, with professional  ardor. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t say that the parties interested in the settlement mightn&rsquo;t be  held to be the purchasers for value&mdash;marriage, you know, Glossop, is a valuable  consideration&mdash;and, in that case, twenty years&rsquo; possession would make the title  good; at least, I think so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  good heavens! Hobegond, to hear you talking like that of a country gentleman&rsquo;s  ancestral estate&mdash;purchasers for value, marriage, and so on. It&rsquo;s horrible,  Hobegond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  we must meet it, my dear sir. Ah; why can&rsquo;t you change one of those girls of  yours for a boy? That would set the question at rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  birth of a boy would put an end to the difficulty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Completely,&rdquo;  cried the lawyer.</p>
<p>Mr.  Glossop whispered a few words into his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon  my word I congratulate you most heartily,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;I hope it will be  as you wish. I shall have more appetite for dinner; for, I assure you, the  matter was troubling me a good deal. Not that I had anything to do with the  blunder, as you know; but I&rsquo;ve a real interest in your affairs. Now I&rsquo;ll go and  pay my respects to the young ladies, and be ready for dinner, too; I don&rsquo;t take  as long as you country gentlemen do to put on a tail coat.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 4<br>
  &ldquo;I Am A Mere Cipher Here&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Marmaduke  Glossop was a very poor creature, and probably thought himself worse than he  really was. How his man Grundy had managed to put up with him for all these  years was a wonder to everybody. Grundy&rsquo;s duties were most harassing and  constant. He had to dress his master in the morning, and to rub him all over  with flannel, during which time Marmaduke would fire into him all the  discontent accumulated during the night. Whenever Marmaduke went out Grundy  must be in attendance, to see him properly wrapped up, and to carry out his  behests, on the drive or walk. In fine, he was nurse, valet, butler, and  general odd man. He was very much attached to the family, and that served him  in lieu of high wages; for Marmaduke was very stiff upon that point. He never  would encourage the feeling of greed in his servants, by increasing their wages  on account of length of service.</p>
<p>Grundy  was helping his master to dress for dinner after Mr. Hobegond had left him. He  was very awkward and preoccupied, and incurred a good deal of wrath from his  master in consequence of his clumsiness. For a nice mannered man, Marmaduke was  rather rough in his language. He never swore; that he would have deemed wrong.  Still, to call a man &ldquo;an infernal pig,&rdquo; even when that man is your own  body-servant, is irritating, one would think, to his feelings. Grundy was well  used to his master; but even he did not like the expression, and threw down the  hair-brushes he was wielding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you&rsquo;d call me a dog, sir, I shouldn&rsquo;t have minded, but a pig! Mr. Glossop, sir,  I wish you&rsquo;d suit yourself in a month, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  looked about him in blank amazement, tinged with a certain amount of fear.  These dreadful modern ideas had crept even into his very household. And he had  the bitterness of thinking that, after all, Grundy was far more necessary to  him than he to Grundy. There would be no difficulty for Grundy in getting a  place: it would be difficult, nay, impossible, for Marmaduke to obtain such  another devoted servant.</p>
<p>There  is very much, however, in habits of command and subordination. Mutiny is hardly  possible unless these have been somewhat relaxed. And Marmaduke reflected that,  although he unfortunately had not the power to compel his servant to continue  to serve him; although he could not order him so many blows with a stick, or to  be shut up and kept on bread and water till the man reflected, yet that he had  one very strong hold upon him&mdash;he need not give him a character, or might give  him a character for impertinence and insubordination. Not that he would have  done such a thing. He was at bottom a man of honor, and would have spoken the  truth about his servant. But the feeling that he had this irresponsible power gave  him a kind of ascendency over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  up those brushes,&rdquo; he cried, firmly, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t let me hear another word of  this. What! Grundy; you who have been nourished on my very hearth, as it were.  Go on, I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundy&rsquo;s  eyes filled with tears. The allusion to the family hearthstone, from which be  had drawn his early nutriment, affected him powerfully. &ldquo;Mr. Glossop, if you  knew, sir, what&rsquo;s; made me so occard this day, sir, you wouldn&rsquo;t call me pig,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was a <em>facon deparler</em>, Grundy,&rdquo; said  his master, mollified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that French, sir?&rdquo; said Grundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, next time you&rsquo;re in a temper, please to put it in French&mdash;it sounds much  pleasanter. <em>Faison deparly</em>&mdash;but that&rsquo;s  a very long word for a pig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  laughed silently, much pleased Grundy had given him an idea. A little  garnished, the man&rsquo;s mistake would serve him for a story for the next round of  dinner-parties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Grundy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and what has happened to put you out of your way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a plot, sir,&rdquo; cried Grundy, &ldquo;a plot against you and your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you, sir. I ain&rsquo;t given to heavesdropping, but it does so happen that  there&rsquo;s a brick out of the wall between my pantry and the nursery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  astonished, Grundy, I thought you knew better; let the brick be replaced, and  don&rsquo;t let me have any servants&rsquo; tattle.&rsquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;It  wasn&rsquo;t tattle, sir; it was talk, serious talk between Mr. Henry and nurse; and  you ought to know what it was. It concerns the estate, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  was silent. Mr. Hobegond&rsquo;s words had occurred to him. &ldquo;If your brother Henry  comes to know of the flaw.&rdquo; There could be nothing wrong in precaution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  what did my brother say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  said, sir (if you&rsquo;ll excuse my mentioning it), what a bad thing it would be for  the young ladies if anything happened as there was a heir, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!  And what did nurse say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  said it mustn&rsquo;t be so; and then they fell a-whispering, and that was all I  heard, except when he went away he says, says be, &lsquo;Money will do anything,  nurse.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  was somewhat staggered. It had occurred to him for the first time that the birth  of an heir would make a very serious difference to his daughters. He had never  thought of them before otherwise than as &ldquo;the children.&rdquo; He had never realized  the idea of their being persons having possible eventual rights and present  expectations. And then, again, he had not, up to this time, considered his  brother as having any possible interest in the &ldquo;estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These  suggestions came upon him suddenly, with possibilities of complications and  &ldquo;bother&rdquo; that set him all of a whirl. There was one comfort, Hobegond was at  hand, on to whom might throw the burden of action.</p>
<p>After  dinner he called Hobegond into the library, and told him what Grundy had  overheard.</p>
<p>Hobegond  wrinkled up his brows. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s rather too &mdash;well, ahem&mdash;too sensational a  plot for real life; in all probability there was mere idle talk between the  two. Still, in this life it&rsquo;s always well to be on guard. I don&rsquo;t see how your  brother could have found out anything about the title, except from that  unfortunate railway business. And a man wouldn&rsquo;t engage in a <em>dangerous</em> conspiracy of that kind <em>unless</em> he had some <em>sure</em> advantage to obtain. But be on your guard&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  how, my dear fellow, how can I undertake to be on guard? Consider my health, my  infirmities; how could I be dodging about the shrubbery on a wet night, for  instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t mean anything of that sort,&rdquo; said Hobegond, laughing; &ldquo;only this: I&rsquo;d  send nurse away for a holiday when the event was expected, and I&rsquo;d take care  that the nurse hired for the occasion was one perfectly trustworthy. The  doctor, I suppose, you can depend upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  far as integrity goes; but he&rsquo;s such a blear-eyed, dim kind of a fellow, that  any deceit might be practiced upon him with impunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;d have another. Get some smart young fellow from the hospital in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  good fellow,&rdquo; cried Marmaduke, &ldquo;do this and do that, it&rsquo;s all very well for you  to say; but do you know on whom all these arrangements depend? Not on me, I am  a mere cipher here; not on me, but on my wife and this very &lsquo;nurse,&rsquo; who is all  in all with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak  to Mrs. Glossop then; represent how important it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop  wrung his hands in despair. He had had some experience of speaking to Mrs.  Glossop about matters that were in her jurisdiction. She never interfered with  his department in any way, but on the one or two occasions when he had  attempted to extend the sphere of his sway over matters that concerned her, he  had been made to feel rather small. So he was mightily troubled at this advice  of Mr. Hobegond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t  you speak to her?&rdquo; he suggested at last, in a doleful, doubtful tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  indeed,&rdquo; said Hobegond, laughing. &ldquo;Why, I daren&rsquo;t speak to my own wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still,  Marmaduke felt there was a difference. Princes and people of distinction often  communicated their wishes to their wives by means of third persons, whereas, of  course, in a man of Hobegond&rsquo;s position the thing was absurd. He was a very  good fellow, Hobegond, but was just a <em>leetle</em> bit forgetful of his real position.</p>
<p>Well,  it was no use looking further to Hobegond. He did not seem alive to the  paramount importance of the thing. He would take the matter into his own hands.  It was an affair almost of state. He would apply to the Home Secretary to allow  a detective officer from Scotland Yard to guard the premises during the ensuing  month of December.</p>
<p>On  second thoughts he went to London himself and took certain precautions.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 5<br>
  &ldquo;Mrs. Glossop, Sir&mdash;A Daughter&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>Peccary  Court, the seat of Mr. Mellon, whose son Dunwal, you will remember, was the  sweetheart of Mirabel, had in its grounds a very large pond or small lake. This  was at the bottom of the slope on which the house stood, where a tiny stream  had been dammed up. When there was a long frost, Peccary Pond afforded the best  skating in the neighborhood, and almost all the country-side came there. This  particular winter happened to be a very severe one. The frost had been keen for  more than a week, and no snow had fallen, so that the ice was in capital  condition. Mr. Mellon always made a virtue of necessity, and permitted any  respectably dressed person to enter his grounds and skate on the big pond,  throwing open his gates for the sake of preserving his fences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls!&rdquo;  cried Mirabel, coming into the schoolroom at Longmoney, &ldquo;girls, you&rsquo;re all to  have a holiday! Papa has consented, at my solicitation, and we are all going to  Mr. Mellon&rsquo;s pond to skate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six  pairs of brows were unbent, six pairs of eyes began to sparkle according to  their several degrees of effulgence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s very jolly!&rdquo; cried one; &ldquo;and as mademoiselle leaves for her holiday  to-morrow, good-bye to work. Hurrah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mademoiselle,  too, smiled her gladness; and then there was an instant disruption of the bonds  of discipline. Books were hurled about, the covers flying in one direction, the  contents in another, and sundry slates &ldquo;shot madly from their spheres,&rdquo; ceasing  to connect themselves any longer with their frames, and becoming from that time  forward lost, wandering slates that nobody would own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Mais, mademoiselles</em>,&rdquo; ejaculated the  governess, &ldquo;<em>tenez, tenez, ce n&rsquo;est pas  gentil ce bruit la</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  we&rsquo;re not going to be <em>gentil</em> any more  till mademoiselle comes back again,&rdquo; cried Gertrude, aged eleven. &ldquo;Amy, make me  a back, and see me fly over you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  here Mirabel interfered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gertrude,  be quiet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Leapfrog is not a game that it is serviceable for girls  to acquire. Now,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;run and get your skates, all of you, and let us  see which are the wise and which the foolish virgins; who has got straps and  everything ready, and who has used up her straps for playing horses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mirabel  herself had a dainty pair of new skates hanging to her finger; but the others  were of the ordinary wooden sort, and rather old-fashioned in make. Marmaduke  had bought a dozen at the sale of a bankrupt iron-monger, and from that time  had caused his girls to practice whenever the ice was safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  for my part,&rdquo; cried Lucy, who was rather heavier in features than the rest, and  who delighted mostly in having her head in a book, &ldquo;for my part, I don&rsquo;t think  it&rsquo;s worth while going in for skating. To learn is such a painful process, and  it&rsquo;s only once in seven years or so that there really is ice fit to skate on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray,  for how many septennial periods does your experience extend?&rdquo; cried Mirabel,  with an air of superiority. &ldquo;The fact is, child, you are lazy, and had rather  have your head in a book. You will grow up yellow and unhappy if you persist in  such ways. We are all to go&mdash;every one of us. Papa says so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  there was a great rush to the nursery cupboard for skates. Of course, a great  many straps were deficient, and equally of course those girls who had lost  their straps had spent their pocket-money also, and wanted to borrow from the  others that they might call at the cobbler&rsquo;s, on their way to the pond, and be  refitted. But prudence and generosity are rather incompatible virtues, and some  tears were shed over missing heel-straps and other straps that could not be  replaced without money; till Mirabel solved the difficulty by promising to pay  for all straps that were wanted, the sum expended to be deducted from the next  quarter&rsquo;s allowance. After this, the foolish virgins had rather the best time  of it, for there was a good deal of interest in seeing the old cobbler cutting  out the straps, and after they were finished they had a glorious race down to  the pond; for Mirabel and the four wise virgins had gone on, and left the careless  ones to follow.</p>
<p>It  was a fine, bright day, and Marmaduke Glossop had ventured out also on the ice,  in a bath-chair propelled by the gardener, while Grundy was in attendance at  the side. Marmaduke was wrapped up to the nose in furs, and wore a respirator and  blue-gauze spectacles, so that it was difficult to catch the expression of his  features; but as far as you could judge from the nodding of his head and the  waving of his hands, he seemed in great good temper.</p>
<p>All  the country-side were on the ice. Rosy young farmers skidding along at their  top speed round and round; young lawyers and doctors from the market town  twirling about, attempting almost more dexterity than was compatible with  grace; the <em>jeunesse doree</em> of the  county, who, having nothing else to do but to practice all day long, and every  day, had many of them reached a pitch of perfection in standing on one leg in  all kinds of attitudes, cutting circles backward and forward, and executing  figures of wonderful intricacy and entanglement, that seemed to have neither  beginning, middle, nor end.</p>
<p>All  this artistic work was done on a square of well-swept ice, that by tacit  understanding was kept for skaters of high degree of proficiency. Some one of  the skidding young farmers burst through occasionally, and made a spread eagle  or two more than was included in the programme of the figures, but on the whole  the inclosure was well kept, and was surrounded by a line of lookers-on, many  of them mothers and sisters of the youths who were exhibiting within.</p>
<p>If  not an exciting, it was at least a solemn scene. The men went through their  evolutions with a gravity and seriousness that formed a strange contrast with  the lightness of their movements. The cold, gray sky, which the sun could not  warm, the frosty rim round the horizon, the smoke rising perpendicularly from  the chimneys of the big house, the network of twig and branch,</p>
<p align="center" class="note">&ldquo;Bare,  ruined choirs, where once the sweet birds sang,&rdquo;</p>
<p>the  rattle of the skates on the ice, the cracks and groans that rose up ever and  again from the chilly flooring, all these gave rise to a feeling of  despondency.</p>
<p>But  there came a change at last over the scene. A drag arrived on the bank, crowded  with scarlet uniforms. It was the band of the &mdash; Dragoons, which one of the  young Mellons, who was an officer in the regiment, had brought over. Now, music  at once relieves the oppression of these cold scenes. The band was established  on the bank, after having been plentifully supplied with mulled ale. It struck  up a lively air. Everybody began to move about freely, to smile and nod, and  beat time to the music.</p>
<p>Presently  a quadrille was called for, and a square of ice was cleared, and a dozen  couples were ready to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another  lady wanted,&rdquo; cried somebody who had constituted himself master of the ceremonies,  coming sweeping up to the chair in which Marmaduke Glossop sat, by the side of  which Mirabel was resting. &ldquo;Now, Miss Glossop, if you please. You&rsquo;re a good  hand. Come along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I&rsquo;d rather not, Captain Turner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  Mirabel, go,&rdquo; said her father; and Captain Turner, taking her hand, skated her  over to where a young gentleman was discontentedly standing, twirling on his  toes for mere melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Here&rsquo;s</em> a partner for you, Miss Glossop.  Now, Mellon, attention. Miss Glossop, Mr. Dunwal Mellon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think we&rsquo;ve met before,&rdquo; said Mirabel, demurely.</p>
<p>Dunwal  stood straight up and looked into Mirabel&rsquo;s eyes in ecstasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  you dear, good girl,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;how beautifully you have managed it. Oh! I  have a hundred things to say to you, each prettier than the last, and I can&rsquo;t  for the life of me think of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  talk nonsense, Dunwal,&rdquo; said Mirabel, severely. &ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t too much time  together that we should waste it in chaff. I didn&rsquo;t manage it at all; it was  quite an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mirabel,&rdquo;  said Dunwal, &ldquo;you never come now to the old tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa  said we were not to meet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  shouldn&rsquo;t meet if we kept the tree between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  would be Jesuitical, Dunwal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  would be very nice, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,  to have the tree between us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  see you there once more, Mirabel. You don&rsquo;t know how I hunger for a sight of  you&mdash;for a touch of your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  have the privilege of touching my hand as soon as the quadrille begins&mdash;but if  you are hungry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will give you my dogskin glove to gnaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will  you really? Well, I will have it then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,  Dunwal: people are looking at us.&rdquo; Mirabel was holding her right-hand glove in  her left hand, which hung down by her side, and Dunwal seized it, squeezing her  little finger in the process.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mamma  will scold me for losing my glove,&rdquo; said Mirabel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you shouldn&rsquo;t have tempted me to take it,&rdquo; cried Dunwal.</p>
<p>Then  the band struck up, and away they went. It would have been very nice if they  had not known that Father Glossop was glowering at them from one corner, and  Mother Mellon from the other, both looking as sour as possible. When they  finished one of the figures, and had time to look about them, they became  conscious of a sudden change. Glossop had disappeared, and Mrs. Mellon was  smiling blandly, and beckoning to Mirabel to come to her. Mirabel started over  to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo; she whispered in her ear, &ldquo;so glad&mdash;a sister, a new sister. Give my love  to mamma, and tell her I&rsquo;ll come as soon as it&rsquo;s proper; there, go back to your  dance, dear; how nicely you did that last twirl, you and Dunwal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mirabel  was a little bit upset. She didn&rsquo;t, after all, think it was quite right for  mamma to have a baby when she had daughters in the house almost grown up. They  didn&rsquo;t want any more of them at home. It was a kind of invasion of their  privileges, to add to their number without consulting the chiefs of the  republic. Mirabel thought she would be rather cool with mamma on the subject.  But why should Mrs. Mellon be so gracious and smiling about it?</p>
<p>Indeed  when the quadrille was over, she found everybody pleased and smiling in a  congratulatory mood. Everybody was very glad; everybody liked Mirabel; and  there was a general feeling of relief that the girls were not to be  disinherited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls  well-bred and with money are such a desideratum in these days, when all our  young men are going after the moneybags,&rdquo; said Mrs. Mellon to a friend.</p>
<p>But  to Marmaduke Glossop the news came as a great disappointment and disquietude.  When the footman had come up to him with a smiling face, and said: &ldquo;Mrs.  Glossop, sir&mdash;a daughter, all quite safely over,&rdquo; and almost expected a guerdon  for the news, Marmaduke felt as if he could knock him down.</p>
<p>He  was outwitted, he knew that; his vigilance, his precautions, had been  unavailing. He had been robbed of his son and heir.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 6<br>
  &ldquo;Five Hundred Pounds Reward&rdquo;</strong></h2>
<p>It  was only during the last month that Mr. Glossop had set up a hall porter.  People had rather laughed at him about it. Such a dignified functionary seemed  to be of small use in the unpretending establishment of Longmoney Hall. He was  a London man, this new servant, and his wife was a London woman. She had been  engaged as laundry maid, but there was no occasion at present for her services  in the laundry, and she had been put into the nursery to look after the younger  children. &ldquo;To look after<em> me</em>, I  think,&rdquo; nurse had said, with a shrug; &ldquo;for she hardly ever keeps her eyes off  me, the woman,&rdquo; </p>
<p>Mrs.  Glossop had been very indignant at this increase in the establishment. &ldquo;As if  we hadn&rsquo;t servants enough, Marmaduke, and the winter likely to be so hard for  the poor.&rdquo; But Marmaduke had his own way in the matter.</p>
<p>Mr.  Glossop, when he got home from the lake, immediately called the new servant to  him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  pretty fellow, indeed, you are, Wilsher, to keep a watch, and to see me cozened  under your very eyes. What does your wife say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  doesn&rsquo;t think it possible, sir, that such a thing should have been brought into  the house. It must have been done in the night if it was done at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night  or day, it was your business to have prevented its being done at all. What are  we to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, as we can&rsquo;t be positive as nothing was brought into the house, we must  take care as they take nothing out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  quite evident, sir, that if there&rsquo;s been any namby-pamby work with what you  think, sir&mdash;if they&rsquo;ve brought a hinfant into the house, there&rsquo;s one to go  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  true enough,&rdquo; said Marmaduke. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, we&rsquo;ll look after that sharp enough; there&rsquo;s me at watch here, and Hemma at  the back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  the side, good heavens! the side of the house; the nursery window looks out  there, and that&rsquo;s where the wicked woman would carry out her plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  iron bars there, sir; I tried &rsquo;em, and I sticks a screw into the sash to make  all safe; oh, don&rsquo;t you fear, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I do fear; I&rsquo;ll go and look myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  had been a slight settlement of rime in the night, which, at the north side of  the house, where the sun&rsquo;s rays did not reach, was still unmelted. Mr. Glossop  ran along the shrubbery till he came to the window of the nursery. Sure enough,  there were footsteps in the white rime going to and coming from the  window&mdash;heavy masculine footsteps.</p>
<p>Glossop  came back pale and excited. &ldquo;Go and look to the nursery window now. Here, pull  those things off; there&rsquo;s no occasion for disguise any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  man stripped off his livery coat and cape, and stood out as an evident police  officer in plain clothes.</p>
<p>He  went round to the nursery window and examined the ground. Then he tried the  window. It had been unfastened, and it opened easily. Then he tested each of the  bars, which were almost close together. Two of the bars had been unfastened at  the end, and could be removed so that an object of some size could be  introduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After  all, the old gent&rsquo;s not so mad as I thought he was. Well, if I&rsquo;d known as there  was anything really up, I&rsquo;d have been a deal sharper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  man&rsquo;s faculties were now roused; his pride was wounded at his having permitted  himself to be deceived. He tracked the footsteps over the hedge, and then,  after marking the place, he came back to Mr. Glossop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you think, Wilsher, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think we&rsquo;ve been done. But the chap, whoever it is, must be close at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think a man is concerned in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course there is, sir. Well, he couldn&rsquo;t come far with a young hinfant could he,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  he couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  where he&rsquo;s brought the one child from, there&rsquo;s the mother waiting to take the  other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  son, my poor little Marmaduke, to be perhaps brought up as a beggar&rsquo;s brat.  Wilsher, if you&rsquo;ll get me back my boy, you shall have a hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you, sir; not but what I&rsquo;d have worked it out without a reward, for the sake of  not being done; still it puts more spirit into one. Now, sir, I&rsquo;m off; all  you&rsquo;ve got to do is, keep an eye upon things, and don&rsquo;t let the nurse go out of  the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  hundred pounds,&rdquo; said Wilsher, as he started off on his quest; &ldquo;well, that&rsquo;s  worth having, and all for a baby boy as one could get hold of for a fiver. I  wish one of mine were young enough for the job. The old gent aren&rsquo;t the  sharpest of coves.&rdquo; Wilsher followed the footsteps, which led him over the  hill.</p>
<p>Presently  they brought him into a macadamized road where he lost the trail. However, the  footsteps, which were distinguishable on the green border of the road, pointed  toward the village of Longmoney.</p>
<p>Wilsher  made directly for the little village inn, and walked into the kitchen. &ldquo;Well,  Mrs. Davies,&rdquo; he said to the landlady, who was warming something over the fire,  &ldquo;the young person with the baby&mdash;up-stairs, is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  she&rsquo;s not,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  did she leave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout  five minutes gone; went off in a fly and pair; and the gentleman too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wilsher  ascertained where the post-chaise came from, and in which direction it went. He  made a guess that it had gone to a station on the Northwestern line, and he  found by consulting a &ldquo;Bradshaw&rdquo; that he had in his pocket, that, by cutting  across to the Great Western, if he drove hard, he would reach London by the  Great Western twenty minutes before the cross-country train would arrive at  Euston. He took his measures accordingly, ran back to Longmoney Hall, ordered a  dog-cart, and the best horse in the stables, and procured a supply of money  from Mr. Glossop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  not going to take your wife, too?&rdquo; cried Mr. Glossop, as he saw that lady get  into the back seat of the dog-cart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Wilsher, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no use watching here now the trick&rsquo;s done. We&rsquo;ve  got to nail &rsquo;em at the other end. I&rsquo;ll take the huniform coat and cape, too,  sir, if you&rsquo;ll allow me; they&rsquo;ll come in useful, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilsher!&rdquo;  cried Glossop, in still greater agitation, &ldquo;five hundred&mdash;recover my boy&mdash;five  hundred pounds on the spot; only bring back my boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  fear, sir; get your check ready, sir; I&rsquo;ll have him back again.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 7<br>
  At Euston Station</strong></h2>
<p>The  three great termini that cluster so closely together in that long, melancholy  road, where a man may perchance see sunning itself in the forecourt of one of  the dingy houses the very mortuary slab that is to commemorate his virtues and  untimely departure&mdash;in that road, sacred to statues and monuments, and uncouth  chimney-pots, and fragrant with the memory of the ever-blessed Morrison, these  three termini, which may be almost said to form the mighty heart of England,  serving as arteries to all the great seats of its manufacturing and mineral  wealth, curiously illustrate those phases of thought that have prevailed within  the last half-century. There is Euston, showing the last fading influences of  the Renaissance, classic, correct, and dull. There is King&rsquo;s Cross, of the era  of 1851, embodying powerful arts, the gospel of trade, glass, and iron, and  good-will to men. There is Pancras, rising grandly in all the butterfly hues of  the Gothic revival. Below them surges the great world; the world of omnibus and  hansom, and pot hats and silk umbrellas; of buying and selling, and chopping  and changing; of carriages and powdered flunkies, and seas voluminous of silk  and tarlatan; of gin-shops and wretchedness and vice; of civilized, self-glorifying  man, dwindling down to the type of the primitive savage, and lower; of a world  governed by greed, and unskillfully directed by policemen or peripatetic  philosophers. Yes, good sooth, you may moralize in Euston Road, only mind the  crossings, and do not miss your train.</p>
<p>The  platform of Euston, from which the trains depart, is much as other platforms,  but is rather brighter than most, as the carriages are white paneled and  cheerful-looking, retaining a little suspicion of the old-fashioned lively coaches.  Here they are, all drawn up in line, forming the express for the North; each  cluster of coaches the temporary dwelling-place of a community.</p>
<p>But  our traveler, who is quickly and yet quietly picking his way among the crowds  of passengers and piles of baggage, is not interested in the train just  departing, apparently, He is looking the other way, and making for the  first-class waiting-room. He peeps in at the door and nods his head, then he  makes an imperceptible sign to a woman who is following him, a person well  dressed in black silk, who looks like a housekeeper or upper nursemaid.</p>
<p>This  female enters the waiting-room in a sharp, decisive manner, and looks round.  Three women with babies in their arms, who, much to the disquietude of other  frequenters of the room, have been sitting on the side benches for the last  half-hour, rise in a sort of questioning way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  says the female, in a quiet, decisive tone, holding up her finger, &ldquo;you were to  meet Lady Brown here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  my lady,&rdquo; cry the three women simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  lady is not here yet, I am the head nurse, I am Mrs. Laker. You are sent here  by the matron of the West-End Hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  which of these children are girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo;  and &ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; cry two of the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, then, I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want you. Here is a shilling for each of you for your  trouble. Go back to Mrs. Crutch, and tell her I&rsquo;m suited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  women went away rather dejected and disappointed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  like your appearance,&rdquo; said Mrs. Laker to the one who remained. &ldquo;I think you will  do; my lady will be here directly. Let me see the infant&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman uncovered the face of a sleeping infant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  little fellow,&rdquo; said Mrs. Laker. &ldquo;But, my dear woman, what a dreadfully dirty  little bib; my lady mustn&rsquo;t see the baby in that state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t got another, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you must get one. Here, take this sovereign and run out into the Euston Road,  and buy a bib and some ribbon for baby. And you&rsquo;d better get a little comforter  or something of that sort. Don&rsquo;t spend more than ten shillings, and bring me  back the change. Here, I&rsquo;ll hold baby while you go. Quick, don&rsquo;t lose a minute,  for my lady will be very angry if you&rsquo;re not here when she comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman was overjoyed at having fallen in with such liberal people, and confided  her baby to the charge of Mrs. Laker.</p>
<p>As  she left the station the bell was ringing for the departure of the train. Mrs.  Laker, looking hastily round, ran out on the platform. A man whom we have seen  before holds open the door of a second-class carriage. Mrs. Laker jumps in with  baby, the man jumps in after her. A whistle sounds. They are off.</p>
<p>The  woman, returning in about ten minutes&rsquo; time, confused by all the intricacies of  the station&mdash;she had come there in the first instance with companions who knew  the way&mdash;became lost in the great hall, wandered into the booking-offices, went  on the platform, and, bewildered with the unaccustomed bustle of traffic,  seemed to lose her head altogether, and could only wander about, timidly asking  any disengaged persons she met if they had seen a lady in a black silk dress,  with her baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  were ye to meet her?&rdquo; cried a porter, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  I don&rsquo;t know, really; some room or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the first-class waiting-room?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  yes; that was it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  here&rsquo;s the first-class waiting-room; look round and see if you can see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is it!&rdquo; cried the woman, joyously; &ldquo;this is the place. Here it was where I was  sitting; but she isn&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  she&rsquo;ll be here presently, I dare say. She&rsquo;s got your baby, you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it isn&rsquo;t likely she&rsquo;ll run away with it; they ain&rsquo;t so vallyble as all that. I  wish some one would run away with one or two of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman sat down and waited patiently, but a little anxiously. As minute after  minute passed away and nobody came, she began to feel alarmed. But, then, Lady  Brown would be so angry if she made a disturbance, and perhaps she&rsquo;d lose a  good place through it. So she sat on, waiting in great misery, for half an  hour.</p>
<p>Then  she began to talk to the people about her, telling them in an incoherent kind  of way of what had happened to her; but everybody drew away from her. &ldquo;Yes,  indeed!&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; and went their ways. And this woman, with a great  trouble and fear in her heart, of what she hardly knew, and overwhelmed with a  sense of her own weakness and want of power of utterance, sank into a passion  of bitter weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  the matter, my good woman?&rdquo; said a sharp, incisive voice; and, looking up, she  saw a shrewd, kindly face looking down upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ve taken away my baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  ay! Poor creature!&rdquo; said the man, compassionately. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve lost your baby.  Well, well, you know we all have to endure losses. Where is your husband, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir! it isn&rsquo;t that; they&rsquo;ve stolen him from me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!  stolen, eh? That&rsquo;s a curious thing. Here, I&rsquo;ve got five minutes to spare, tell  me all about it. Gently, now, don&rsquo;t hurry yourself, and tell me as if you were  telling your husband. I&rsquo;m a married man; with a lot of babes of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  bless you, sir,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t much to tell. Me and two other  ladies was sent up here by the matron of the Lynin &rsquo;Ospital to meet a lady as  wanted a wet nurse. You see, sir, my husband ain&rsquo;t in work now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind all that; you met some one here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; and says she&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind what she said. What did she do? Did she take your baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; and says she, looking at the child&rsquo;s bib, as wasn&rsquo;t over clean p&rsquo;raps;  although you know, sir, with my &rsquo;usband being out of work&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut,  tut, what did she do with the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Well, sir, says she, giving me a suvrin, which I&rsquo;ve got the change of in my  hand, please sir, and I only spent seven and six&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll  do. She gave you a sovereign, and held the baby while you went to buy  something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; and the difficulty I has to find a shop where they sold babies&rsquo; things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, Well, when you came back she was gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman nodded, and began to weep again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  will do,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I am a lawyer; Mr. Hobegond. Come with me to the  station-master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  on his way he stopped. &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we shall only waste time. Now describe  the woman who took the baby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  was dressed very handsome&mdash;in black silk, with a black bonnet, and a little bit  of a white feather in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send  the platform inspector here,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hobegond to a porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  inspector, I&rsquo;m Mr. Hobegond, of Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. This person has lost a baby,  taken away by a woman in a black silk dress, black bonnet, and white feather.  How long since, my good woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About  three quarters of an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, a train went out at 10, at 10:10 A.M., and at 10:15. None since, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s  have the porters here who attended to those trains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  host of porters were soon gathered together. One of the men remembered seeing a  lady get into a carriage with a baby; and he had noticed that a man had held  the door open for her. A smart-looking man, something like a policeman, he  thought. That was by the 10 o&rsquo;clock express.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  train don&rsquo;t stop till Rugby, I think,&rdquo; said Mr. Hobegond, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir, it do now,&rdquo; cried a porter; &ldquo;it stops at Willesden Junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  to the booking-office with me,&rdquo; cried Mr. Hobegond to the inspector, &ldquo;and let  us see whether a man of that description took a couple of tickets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes,  the clerk recollected such a man, who took two second-class tickets to  Willesden Junction.</p>
<p>Mr.  Hobegond dropped his hands. &ldquo;They have got clean away; doubtless back to London  again, depend upon it. You&rsquo;d better go to a police magistrate and make a  complaint, and then the matter will get into the papers. Don&rsquo;t cry; you&rsquo;ll get  your baby back, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  this moment the inspector came back. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had a telegram from Willesden.  Nobody alighted from the express except two servants for Longmoney Hall, for  whom a carriage was waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  graciousl What an extraordinary coincidence!&rdquo; cried Hobegond. Pray, my good  woman, was your baby a male or a female?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  boy, if you please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear,  dear,&rdquo; said Hobegond, taking a turn or two along the platform, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s a pretty  go. I can&rsquo;t suspect my old friend Glossop, and yet&mdash;if it had been a girl they&rsquo;d  taken I should have known what it meant. What am I to do? It&rsquo;s no affair of  mine; and yet&mdash;no&mdash;I can&rsquo;t leave the woman in the lurch. Look here, I&rsquo;m going to  Willesden, my good woman, by the next train. Come along with me, and we&rsquo;ll look  for your baby.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 8<br>
  The Young Heir Of Longmoney</strong></h2>
<p>Marmaduke  Glossop felt at once that his position in his own house was a very awkward one.  He was in an attitude of momentary antagonism to all in the household; his only  allies had departed. Mrs. Glossop had sent several messages to him, desiring to  see him, and he knew not on what pretext to avoid a meeting. Now, to do him  justice, he had a very powerful affection for his wife, and his heart was torn  at the idea that she was ill and wanting to see him, and that he could not go  to her. But that he felt was impossible. He did not harbor the slightest  suspicion that his wife was implicated in the conspiracy to deceive him. She,  as well as himself, had been cajoled and cheated. But he could not go and visit  her, and receive and acknowledge, as he would be called upon to receive and  acknowledge, the changeling as his child. On the other hand, it would be  impossible to explain the matter now. Such an <em>eclaircissement</em> might be the death of his wife, in her present  condition. &ldquo;I must wait,&rdquo; said Marmaduke to himself, &ldquo;wait for the auspicious  moment when, with my own boy in my arms, I can restore him to the bosom of his  delighted mother. What a moment of joy that will be, compensating for all the  sufferings I have undergone&mdash;am still undergoing,&rdquo; said Marmaduke, with a sigh.</p>
<p>The  dressing-bell had rung for dinner, and Marmaduke was dreadfully hungry: the  keen air of winter had given him a wolfish appetite. He rang for Grundy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grundy,&rdquo;  he said, dolefully, to his man, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel well, and must retire to my own  room. Let me have some dry toast and gruel, and let a mounted messenger be in  readiness to take a telegram to the station. And wait, Grundy; let this note be  given to Mrs. Glossop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marmaduke  scrawled a hasty <em>billet</em></p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Dearest  Isabel,&rdquo; he wrote&mdash;&ldquo;How grieved I am I cannot see you. I am suffering from  incipient fever. I trust nothing serious, but <em>possibly</em> infectious; hence I dare not come near you or the  children, but will remain secluded in my own apartment.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Ever  your devoted husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear,&rdquo; cried Glossop, when his servant had gone, &ldquo;this playing of a double  part, how horrible it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  telegram he subsequently dispatched was to Mr. Hobegond, bidding him repair  without an instant&rsquo;s delay to Longmoney Hall.</p>
<p>Then  he took to his bed, and remained there till noon next day, when Grundy rushed  in and announced&mdash;but we must not anticipate matters.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Yes;  the moment of Mr. Glossop&rsquo;s triumph had arrived. He had received a telegram  from Wilsher that morning:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  boy secured! send a trap to Willesden Junction by 10.15, to make all square.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was a very long drive to Willesden Junction, and Mr. Glossop did not see why a  nearer station had not been selected; but he supposed Wilsher had his reasons.</p>
<p>Mr.  Glossop had listened anxiously for the sound of wheels as soon as, by any  possibility, the dog-cart might be thought due to return. There had been sundry  false alarms, but at last the moment had come; Grundy ran into his master&rsquo;s  room breathless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilsher  has come, sir, and his wife; and there&rsquo;s a baby with &rsquo;em, crying like mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring  him here,&rdquo; cried Glossop, who had been sitting brooding over the fire in his  dressing-gown. &ldquo;Thank Heaven, this suspense is over, and right and I am  triumphant.&rdquo; Big with this thought, he sat down and seized a pen, and wrote a  check for five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>A  dolorous wailing that at first was indistinct and muffled, now rose into a  perfect roar of sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong  lungs, strong lungs!&rdquo; cried Glossop, in ecstasy. &ldquo;Ah! he&rsquo;ll never suffer as his  poor father has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop  rose when the door opened&mdash;rose to receive his son.</p>
<p>Wilsher  entered in his robes as hall porter, carrying in his arms an infant, who roared  and screamed lustily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; said Wilsher, shouting through the tumult, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve got him; but a dreadful  job we had. Hunted &rsquo;em through all London, sir, but we&rsquo;ve got him! I&rsquo;ll go into  particulars shortly, sir; but you&rsquo;d like to take the child to his mother, sir,  now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  yes, Wilsher, and here&rsquo;s the check. Wait below till you&rsquo;re sent for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many  thanks, sir, for your munificence,&rdquo; said Wilsher, disappearing as quickly as he  could. He didn&rsquo;t wait in the hall, however, but jumped into the dog-cart that  had met them at Willesden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  for Uxbridge as hard as we can pelt. Sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t want you, John,&rdquo; he cried to the  groom who stood at the horse&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>John  stared, but did not venture to disobey a person of Wilsher&rsquo;s importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  Grundy,&rdquo; cried Mr. Glossop, &ldquo;get me that furred robe that&rsquo;s hanging up in my  room&mdash;the scarlet one with the sable round it. Half these things depend on first  impressions. The very sight of him must warm his mother&rsquo;s heart. There, there,  Grundy, wrap it round him. Come, come, my darling; this won&rsquo;t do, all this  screaming. I want you to look your very best. Grundy, this is <em>awful</em>. How shall we stop him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give  him something to suck, sir; a paper-knife, a penwiper, or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,  there, there, my pretty dearie. Grundy, there&rsquo;s a wonderful likeness to me;  don&rsquo;t you see? Oh, you&rsquo;ll hear by and by, Grundy, all about it. Thanks to you a  good deal, Grundy; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you please, sir,&rdquo; said nurse, appearing in the passage, &ldquo;missus sends her love,  and wants to know what all this screaming is about. It will wake <em>baby </em>up, she says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baby,  indeed, you wicked woman,&rdquo; said Glossop, hurrying past her, with a scowl, the  boy-baby wrapped up in the scarlet robe, like a young Caesar, lying in his  arms. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see directly-my good woman, the awful effects of your conduct.&rdquo;  So saying, he hurried away, followed by nurse and Grundy, to the gynecium, or  women&rsquo;s apartments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isabel,  Isabel!&rdquo; cried Mr. Glossop from the outer room, which was used for the new baby  and its nurse, a room where flannels were hanging to air, and where there was a  dainty <em>berceau</em> all hung with blue  ribbons, and with costly lace about it. &ldquo;Isabel, prepare for a joyful  surprise!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  the baby, sir, the baby; you&rsquo;ll wake the baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,  take that creature away,&rdquo; he cried, giving the basket a kick with his foot.</p>
<p>Nurse&mdash;the  monthly one&mdash;screamed violently, and ran toward her charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious  goodness,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the master&rsquo;s gone mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nurse,  nurse! what&rsquo;s all this noise about?&rdquo; cried a voice from the inner room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  that creature out of the basket, and let it be taken into the kitchen,&rdquo; cried  Glossop. &ldquo;And now tell Mrs. Glossop that I have brought her the real, her own,  her very own darling&mdash;the young heir of Longmoney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you want to kill my lady?&rdquo; screamed the nurse. &ldquo;Oh, thank Heaven, here&rsquo;s the  doctor! Do take the master away, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes; really, my patient <em>must</em> be kept  quiet,&rdquo; cried the doctor, taking Glossop by the arm, and thrusting him out,  baby and all, into the passage. He was a determined man, Jenkins, when he was  roused.</p>
<p>Glossop  tore his hair with rage. Oh, why had he no captain of the guard at hand to whom  he might cry, &ldquo;<em>A moil</em>&rdquo; and end the  dispute by main force? They would deny <em>him</em> next&mdash; him, the master of Longmoney Hall; would call him a lunatic, and try to  shut him up. Oh, the plot was diabolical. But there was Wilsher! Yes; why didn&rsquo;t  he think of him before. Wilsher was a tower of strength. Armed with the majesty  of the law, all the wiles of his enemies would go for naught. What a wonderful  piece of wisdom it had proved, his engaging an officer of the law to aid him in  unraveling this conspiracy. He would go down into the hall at once and summon  him; he wouldn&rsquo;t trust himself in his own room, he might be locked in; but let  him once communicate with Wilsher, and he was safe.</p>
<p>But  the baby was such an incumbrance; he was tired of holding it, his arms ached  till they were ready to drop off, and how it screamed and roared! surely it  would have a fit. From red it became scarlet, from scarlet purple, from purple  black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grundy!  Grundy!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;would you mind holding the baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grundy  shook his head. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t used to them, sir,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Yes,  even Grundy was deserting him; but if he could only reach the hall with his  burden he would be safe. Wilsher&rsquo;s wife understood babies; she would take him  for the moment, until he could be fairly reinstated in his proper position.</p>
<p>A  tall footman stood in the hall vacantly gazing about him, wondering what all  the hullabaloo was about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,  Fletcher!&rdquo; cried Glossop. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Wilsher and his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drove  off in the dog-cart, sir! didn&rsquo;t stop here five minutes, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop  groaned. Wilsher had gone to secure some of the culprits, no doubt; but it was  very wrong of him to leave without saying that he was going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fletcher,  would you mind holding the baby,&rdquo; cried Glossop; he was almost in despair and  at his wits&rsquo; end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather  not, sir,&rdquo; said Fletcher, drawing himself up; &ldquo;hadn&rsquo;t I better fetch the nurse,  sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I must put him on the floor. I shall pack all you insolent, disobedient people  out of the house to-morrow; but in the meantime I must put him on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  here the hall door was flung open, and Hobegond appeared, followed by a woman.  She, as soon as she caught sight of the infant, ran and snatched it from  Glossop&rsquo;s failing arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  my pretty popsy,&rdquo; she cried, folding it to her breast; &ldquo;oh, my little darling,  how could they be so cruel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  with me,&rdquo; cried Hobegond, seizing Glossop by the arm, &ldquo;come to the library.  Grundy, see this woman fed and attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  cries had now ceased; there was once more peace in the household.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  glad you&rsquo;ve come, Hobegond,&rdquo; said Glossop. &ldquo;I want your help to expose this  most infernal conspiracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop  told the whole story, as far as he knew it, in a confused, incoherent way.  Hobegond&rsquo;s face grew longer and longer as he listened; he shook his head  several times during his progress, and when it was finished, he rose and put  his hand on his friend&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  won&rsquo;t <em>do</em> my dear fellow, it won&rsquo;t <em>do</em>,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the story won&rsquo;t hold  water at all. I&rsquo;m sorry to speak so to an old friend, but I can&rsquo;t help it.  You&rsquo;re in a very dangerous position; take my advice, and get out of it as  quickly as possible. Give this poor woman a ten-pound note, and send her home  rejoicing with her brat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the last drop in poor Glossop&rsquo;s cup. Everybody had forsaken him. He fairly  wept. &ldquo;Gad, I didn&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;d join in it, Hobegond!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  look here, Glossop, it&rsquo;s no use carrying it off in that way. I&rsquo;ll tell you the  whole story my way, gainsay it if you can. You believed that it was of  paramount importance that you should have a son and heir. Nobody else knows of  the importance, mind you, but you and I. Well, you lay your plans; if a son is  born&mdash;and you almost make up your mind that you are sure to have one&mdash;well and  good; if a daughter, then you have your agents ready. One Wilsher, a detective,  who, I am informed, was dismissed from the force for malpractices, and set up  on his own account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  told me he was in the employment of the government, and specially reserved for  such services.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  that&rsquo;s as may be,&rdquo; said Hobegond, doubtfully; &ldquo;but here he is, at all events,  installed in your house on one pretext or another. Very well. The event occurs  for which you have been waiting, and does not carry out your hopes. There is a  girl instead of a boy. Instantly this agent of yours is dispatched to London.  He goes to a lying-in hospital, and requests that wet-nurses may be sent to  meet a fictitious person at Euston station. A male child is surreptitiously  abstracted from its mother, is brought down here, where your carriage is  waiting to receive it; and we next hear of your attempting to foist this child  off as the one just born. My dear friend, I&rsquo;m sorry to say it, but if you were  put on trial for that offense I&rsquo;d defend you as an old friend, although I&rsquo;m not  at all in that way; but the only line of defense that I could suggest would be  insanity. Why, the very fact of your having suborned this man at a high price  to procure you a male child would damn your case utterly. Now, can you deny  that to me, as a friend? Can you put your hand on your check-book and say, &lsquo;Not a penny have I paid for this purpose?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glossop  groaned. All the world had turned topsy-turvy, and was dancing about in hideous  confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t prove it,&rdquo; he cried at last; &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t prove it. The boy is  mine&mdash;mine, I tell you&mdash;I know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  this way,&rdquo; cried Hobegond. &ldquo;If you are capable of being reasoned with; come  this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  were told that the woman and the babe had been taken to the nursery, and there  they found them: the woman sitting in high contentment at a table, with a good  dinner before her, and a tankard of stout, and, moreover, a cradle on each side  of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you quite sure as to this being your boy, my good woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless  your eyes, sir, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. Why, sir, the vaccination marks is  enough to show that, sir, because it was done so young. &rsquo;Twas that made him so  fretful, poor dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman drew up the child s frock, and showed the marks on his arm.</p>
<p>Glossop  ground his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it&rsquo;s all right now, sir. The good lady has engaged me as wet nurse, sir; and  I&rsquo;m quite satisfied, sir; and I understand how it was my fault, sir, as was too  late for the train, and the young woman was obliged to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, all right,&rdquo; cried Hobegond, drawing Glossop away lest he should say  anything to disturb this excellent state of things. &ldquo;Come back to the library.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  you see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how wonderfully well you are out of this scrape. You ought  to go down on your hands and knees and thank Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo;  cried Mirabel, at this moment appearing in the library, &ldquo;mamma sends her love,  and thanks you so much for being so thoughtful about the nurse, and she&rsquo;s so  sorry she was so rude to you when you came to show her nurse&rsquo;s baby, such a  fine little fellow. And our baby takes to nurse wonderfully. Oh, I didn&rsquo;t see  there was anybody here,&rdquo; she said, drawing back in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  only Hobey, Old Hobey, as you used to call him,&rdquo; cried Hobegond, coming forward  and giving Mirabel a kiss. &ldquo;Goodness me, to think of a little dot of a thing I  used to jump about on my foot a grown young lady and presented at court; and  going to be married too, I dare say, in a jiffy, if one only knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s  Squire Mellon, sir, and Mr. Dunwal, wish to see you, sir,&rdquo; cried Fletcher,  coming to the library door. Mirabel vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great  powers!&rdquo; cried Glossop, looking wildly about him, &ldquo;is it all a delusion, then,  this Longmoney Conspiracy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  it was not so much of a delusion after all. Nurse confessed it at last on her  deathbed. She and Mr. Henry had laid a plan to change the boy for a girl, if one  were born. As it happened, a girl was born, and so the plot was needless.  Wilsher had caught Mr. Henry and his charge at the station, but finding that  the child that was with him was a female, he saw no chance of earning the  reward promised except by a little plot of his own.</p>
<p>After  all, the deed of release that had been wanting, and that had made Glossop&rsquo;s  marriage settlement invalid, was found in the muniment room at Longmoney, and  there is no doubt that the seven Misses Glossop will eventually come in for  their appropriate share of that handsome estate. There are still only seven  Misses Glossop, as Mirabel married young Mellon last year, on which occasion  there were great rejoicings all over the country-side.</p>
<p>Wilsher  made his way to America with his five hundred pounds, where, let us hope, he  found full scope for his peculiar talents.</p>

  Hope</strong></h2>
<p>Which  shall it be? The Rhine? Not again if I know it, as I do, every inch of the  journey, where I shall see fresh editions of every familiar group and  individual on the route, from St. Katherine&rsquo;s Dock to Strasbourg&mdash;from the  unhappy young children, who cause precipitate retreats from the well-supplied <em>table d&rsquo;hote</em> on board the steamer, by  ill-advised announcements that &ldquo;We are now upon the sea,&rdquo; to the majestic and  reserved family groups of Britons who percolate the fantastic ruins on the  banks of the Rhine. No, not the Rhine again. Mont Blanc? No, I thank you. I  admire the bravery of the guides, I wonder at the pluck of the Alpine climbers;  but I confess to no ambition to figure as a principal in a newspaper paragraph  headed &ldquo;Recent ascent of Monte Rosa&mdash;fatal accident to an English tourist;&rdquo; and  as the daily ascent to my chambers on the second floor in Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn Fields  is generally followed by temporary prostration of my vital powers, this  experience, as well as the mature prudence of forty years, suggests to my mind  some more level form of recreation.</p>
<p>Italy I can hardly embrace in the limit of time which  I can allow for relaxation, and I object to the unsatisfactory result of a  scampering tour, when all the memories of the varied scenes passed through  appear as viewed through a mental kaleidoscope. Norway is nearer, but that land  is fast losing its unsophisticated reputation. On every fiord, from Christiania  to Lofoden, you may meet with some adventurous Oxonian, abandoning his books,  his boating, and his billiards, for fishing-tackle and reindeer sledges; and  not being an enthusiastic sportsman, I do not consider that life, in a  temperature ever so much below zero, can be compensated for by splendid success  in the pursuit of salmon in the icy fiords, or the slaughter of the most  gigantic elk that ever trod the Norwegian &ldquo;fjeldes.&rdquo; There is left to me Spain.  I breathe hard at the words South of Spain. How it was that my excursive ideas  had not taken this direction before I cannot divine. Here, to a certain extent,  I am not in an over-beaten track; here, where railroads are not as yet (I am  speaking of nearly a score of years ago); where locomotion is facilitated by  the ass or mule with a dignity unknown to their British brethren; where the  orange can be plucked in its native grove, and where the olive is at home. The  South of Spain, of course. I have a week before me to study the details of my  route, and to post myself up in preliminary information.</p>
<p>I  heaved a deep sigh of relief as soon as I had formed my determination, and felt  that it would take a great deal of argument to dissuade me from my project.  Indeed, I would altogether avoid the necessity for argument by keeping my plans  entirely to myself until my traps were ready labeled for my departure; for I  had already had experience of that curious perversity in the human mind which  induces a friend, however much he may coincide with your views in the  generality of your actions, to uniformly suggest every objection that he can  muster upon the subject of the projected trip upon which you have set your  heart. That spot of your wishes is the worst that you could select. Low fever  is decimating the inhabitants. There the east winds have their fixed abode, or  the drainage is terribly defective. Why not go to Shingleton-on-the-Ooze? You  decide upon Shingleton. &ldquo;What!&rdquo; says another friend, to whom you have imparted  your change of journey; &ldquo;my dear fellow, you are mad! The poisonous effluvia  from the back-water is expelling visitors by the score; the malaria generated  is worse than the Campagna. Try Shellcliffe.&rdquo; And so you determine on the last,  only to encounter more dismal objections from the next partaker of your  confidence. In fact, no matter where be the spot upon which you have settled to  sojourn, ghosts of all horrors, possible and impossible, are conjured up to  warn you off. Knowing all this, I resolved to keep my schemes to myself.</p>
<p>In  a week&rsquo;s time I shall start, the interval being occupied in settling some  matters for clients, and giving instructions as to business to be got on with  in my absence, and to get forward with my work. I commence at once at my  papers, but somehow I cannot apply myself to my task. In vain I took up the  draft for Barbara Hookem&rsquo;s marriage settlement to examine; and equally  unavailable was my attempt to get into shape the fresh (tenth) codicil to  General Pepnerley&rsquo;s will. Visions of bullfights, Spanish gypsies, and the Court  of Lions in the Alhambra, formed a species of mental dissolving views quite incompatible  with the frame of mind which I should bring to bear upon matters of some legal  importance. I put aside the settlement and the general&rsquo;s codicil as not being  at present easy of tackling. These were only cases of mild despair; but an  attempt to frame the case for counsel&rsquo;s opinion in a complicated claim for  compensation, where Boker&rsquo;s pigs had broken through Foker&rsquo;s fences, and Foker&rsquo;s  cow-boy (of weak intellect) had cut off the tails of the aforesaid pigs, and  otherwise maimed and ill-treated them, completely floored me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  will never do,&rdquo; I groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  don&rsquo;t do it, old fellow,&rdquo; observed a voice at my elbow.</p>
<p>I  turned round and beheld my old chum, Charles Fawcett, whose entrance I had not  noticed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  remark is very just,&rdquo; I said, shaking him warmly by the hand. &ldquo;I must not allow  a poetical reverie to usurp the place of business reflections.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must possess a wonderful power for mental abstraction,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to  accomplish such a feat in this bower of musty papers and red tape. That array  of tin boxes, like japanned coffins in a family vault of dead clients, is  enough to check any attempted flight of fancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  took a chair in his easy way, and for a moment I thought he looked more  thoughtful than I had ever seen him before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want to bother you, Tom,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I have a little matter of  business which I should like to speak to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  idea of &ldquo;business&rdquo; in connection with Charley Fawcett seemed to me to present  such an incongruous combination that I evidenced my surprise in my countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  fact is,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you acted in relation to my poor father&rsquo;s affairs, and  are aware of the provision left for my mother&rsquo;s enjoyment&mdash;enjoyment, alas! such  as her infirmity permits. The annual sum which she receives I have been in the  habit of augmenting, as much as has lain in my power, out of the earnings from  my profession; and as the absence of this addition, in the event of my  predeceasing her, would necessitate the relinquishment of many little luxuries  to which she has been accustomed, I want you to give me your advice as to the  best means of securing her against the contingency to which I have referred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  showed him how, by payment down in full, or by an annual sum, he might secure  at some safe office an annuity for his mother&rsquo;s life in the event of his dying  before her; and from his age, and apparently excellent constitution, I  anticipated that no difficulty could possibly arise.</p>
<p>Charley  pondered a few minutes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  fact is,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am such a muff at matters of business that I should be  grateful if you would carry the matter through for me. Can it be done soon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  referred to the prospectus of an office with which I had had several  transactions of a similar nature, and saw that by starting at once we should  drop upon the medical examiner and get the proposition in train at once.</p>
<p>Charley  gave himself up to my guidance with an air of placid resignation, with the most  undefined idea of the processes for the furtherance of his filially  affectionate arrangement, and his hesitation in affording the necessary  information as to family history and other particulars usual in such cases  must, I fear, have proved very trying to the worthy secretary of the assurance  company, who was taking down his replies to the printed interrogatories. How  vividly the whole scene came back to me some weeks afterward! and how different  the memory of the event to the amused feelings which I could not help  experiencing when the scene was actually before me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  old was my father when he died? What complaint did he die of?&rdquo; he said,  repeating the secretary&rsquo;s inquiries. &ldquo;What on earth has that to do with me? I  was a child at the time I lost him. I believe that his illness was a short  one.&rdquo; At the question of insanity in the family (one of the ordinary queries),  he fairly laughed outright. His answer and its bearing on events to come rushed  burning upon my memory since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;My uncle was an oddity,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The  keen-eyed secretary wanted some information upon this point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was  he eccentric?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  was a retired naval captain,&rdquo; Charley answered; &ldquo;never would have a bell in his  house. Summonses to the servants were facilitated by a boatswain&rsquo;s whistle; but  my father&rsquo;s family were odd people, I have always heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  secretary jotted down a private memorandum, and after a few more questions were  asked and answered, rang in the messenger to conduct Charley to the medical  officer. On his return I saw from his manner that there was some sense of the  ridiculous, struggling with a suspicion of irritability, as if his  unsophisticated ideas upon a process taken as a matter of course by a business  man upon a similar transaction had received some shock, and I found that I was  correct in my impression when he detailed to me on our way back to my chambers  the interview between him and the worthy doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confound  it,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think he must have deemed me mad from the questions he asked  me. He said he noticed excitability. As if it could be otherwise when he spent  half his time ferreting out every incident relating to my father&rsquo;s family, not  leaving out the diseases of which my infant brothers and sisters died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  soon, however, showed him the necessity of the inquiries, which apparently  satisfied him; and he was about to leave me, when he suddenly said, &ldquo;Of course,  from this freak of mine, you guess why I am desirous of having one anxiety off  my mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have formed my own opinion upon the subject,&rdquo; I replied; &ldquo;and the conclusion at  which I have arrived is that you have seen Miss Eveleigh&rsquo;s father, and the interview  has been satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I am to see him to-morrow, Grace feeling with me that the  necessity for withholding the fact of our engagement exists no longer. The  income which I derive from my profession I think now will amply justify my  aspirations in the view of Mr. Eveleigh. I have, as you know, struggled hard  for a position in the foremost rank of art, and the brilliant reward which I  hoped would crown my efforts has been the main cause of my success, Grace has  been most true throughout. She was well aware that the old gentleman&rsquo;s pride of  wealth (represented, by the bye, in dock shares and warehouses) would revolt at  the idea of the union of his only daughter with a <em>painter</em> (who, I firmly believe, was associated in his mind with a glazier&rsquo;s  business), and agreed to bide the time until I should gain some success and  renown in my profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  success has been most well deserved,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;You have certainly been  lionized to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have felt my success the more,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;since it has introduced me into  circles where I have met Mr. Eveleigh, and with no sense of inferiority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley  was quite correct. He had been taken up unquestionably by the upper set, not  merely as a celebrity provided to add to the <em>eclat of conversazione</em>, and in the intervals of the reunions to be  unrecognized, but as a welcome and appreciated equal. His high talents were in  an eminent degree united with a refinement of mind and ease of manner, and,  above all, with a guilelessness and ease of bearing which added a peculiar  charm. Devoted to his art, in the pursuit of which he had attained such  eminence, so far from his success and the admiration which he had excited  having had any other effect upon his mind than that of a simple and honest  pride, he was always the first to notice his defects and to acknowledge just  criticisms which his friends would deem harsh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  both think,&rdquo; said Charley, &ldquo;that Mr. Eveleigh may now be a sharer in our  confidence. Whatever prejudices he may have entertained against my profession  may not operate harshly against me now. As regards my family, I do not  anticipate that a comparison of our ancestry would place my antecedents in an  unfavorable light. As to the mercenary part, I confess that it does seem audacity  in me to ask him to allow his dear girl to resign the splendor in which she has  reigned supreme, to share my fortune, which is insignificant in comparison, and  the continuance of which is dependent on the steadiness of my hand and an  undiminished vigor in my imaginative ideas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked just a trifle anxious as he spoke, but quickly recovered his usual  cheerful manner as he added, &ldquo;I will look in upon you here, and tell you the  result of my interview. I propose seeing Mr. Eveleigh at Wimbledon to-morrow  before he starts for town, for I could not give utterance to what I have to say  with the ceaseless, jarring sounds of commercial activity in my ears; with  everything around him to justify his views upon the sublimity of wealth which  they symbolize to him, and I without the rustle of a leaf or the twitter of a  bird to support me in my unsubstantialities. &rdquo;</p>
<p>He  spoke this with a kind of humor, but I could detect an under-current of anxiety  which he endeavored to suppress; and the laugh with which he left me, as I told  him that it would be his own fault if I had not to congratulate him upon the  result of his journey, had something of a shiver in it; but I thought no more  of the incident at present.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2<br>
  Despair</strong></h2>
<p>I thought  more of it the next day when the morning&rsquo;s post brought me two letters to my private  address&mdash;one an official-looking affair from the assurance office to me, in my  capacity of private referee of Charley on the subject of yesterday&rsquo;s business;  the other from Mr. Eveleigh (who was an old client of mine), inviting me to a <em>fete</em>, which he said his daughter&rsquo;s  programme had arranged should open with croquet and conclude with dancing,  intimating at the same time that a whist-table or two would be made up. This  invitation I felt it a duty as well as a pleasure to accept. There was a  current of high and honorable feeling in Mr. Eveleigh which I had always  experienced in my intercourse with him professionally and otherwise, and which  had greatly attracted me; and he had an ardent and genuine affection for his  only daughter which I could not but admire, contrasting as it did so much with  his strict, and, to casual acquaintances, absorbing devotion to mercantile  pursuits.</p>
<p>My  replies having been dispatched, I took my way from Hampstead (where I lived) to  my chambers, and got through a good deal of business in the day. Returning  home, I invested in a tourist&rsquo;s hand-book, which might prove profitable to me  in my intended trip&mdash;useful it might be, but amusing certainly not. The  selection of varied routes was an advantage, but the reading was hardly of the  description which might be called light.</p>
<p>There  were suggested excursions for the &ldquo;idler,&rdquo; the &ldquo;antiquarian,&rdquo; the &ldquo;invalid,&rdquo;  the &ldquo;military,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;artist&rdquo; traveler. I could not find out that I came  strictly into any one of these classes. I nodded over the &ldquo;general history&rdquo; of  the country. I had a few dozes over the &ldquo;hints to travelers,&rdquo; and fairly went  to sleep in a chaos of the relative values between English and Spanish weights,  distances, and measures. I think that it was in a dreamy and confused attempt  to remember that sixteen dollars, eight arrobas, or a hundredweight equaled one  English mile, that I finally snored, and had a horrid dream of a sensitive  Spanish muleteer, who was attempting to garrote me in an awful &ldquo;sierra,&rdquo;  because I refused a &ldquo;cigaretto,&rdquo; which he offered to me, telling him that his  tobacco was vile, and that his cloak would be the better for a washing. When I  awoke to the reality of a grip, not upon my throat, but upon my arm, the  disturber of my dream revealed itself to me in the person of Charley; but the  drearn-terror was trifling when compared with my waking sensation as I gazed  upon the altered, despairing countenance of my visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  Heaven&rsquo;s sake tell me what has happened?&rdquo; I exclaimed, as soon as I could  recover anything like self-possession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happened?&rdquo;  he repeated. &ldquo;Oh, Tom, I have hardly the power to tell you the miserable story.  Have you any wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  filled a tumbler half full of sherry, which he drank at one gulp, and then sat  trembling upon the sofa with his head between his hands. With an effort he  spoke again, but his voice had lost all its old careless, joyous tone; it was  husky and indistinct, as if his organs of speech had suffered some slight  paralysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  what has happened? Objections I might have combated, fancied difficulties,  financial or social, I could have surmounted; but rejection, absolute and  final, I never could have anticipated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  surely&mdash;&rdquo; I was about to elicit what was the cause assigned, and hesitated from  a feeling of delicacy. He divined the reason for my hesitation, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All  explanation was declined. I pleaded a justification of my hopes in my assurance  of his dear girl&rsquo;s affection for me; but with a result, if possible, more  crushing to my feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  turned round from the sofa and poured out some more sherry, drinking it as  before, in the same ravenous style, and then went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Eveleigh assured me that, however much I may have encouraged my own hopes, he  had the full concurrence of his daughter in the answer which he had given me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  me,&rdquo; I said, in utter astonishment, &ldquo;whom you have intrusted with your  confidence throughout, this is indeed inexplicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inexplicable!&rdquo;  he almost shouted out, and starting to his feet paced rapidly the limits of the  room. &ldquo;Do you know that it inspires me with a distrust and horror of myself?  Can my past, which seemed to me so happy&mdash;happy in its present, happy in its  bright hopes for the future&mdash;have been but a continued mental delusion? Have the  flattery and the approbation which have been lavished upon my endeavors for  success been but mockeries? Have I, in my deep devotion to Grace, which gave inspiration  to my efforts, misunderstood her feelings&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  stopped his hand as it was again stretched out toward the decanter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  more at present, Charley. Let us talk the matter over quietly, and see what we  can make of it. Are you satisfied that Mr. Eveleigh truly expresses Grace&rsquo;s  feelings upon the subject?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  said so,&rdquo; Charley replied; &ldquo;nay, more, that if I desired it he would furnish me  with her written rejection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  was up again, and pacing the room as before, when he stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you know what all this means?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It means the waste of a youth that has  promised more than it has yet performed. It means the blasting of a future  which held to view so bright a prospect of happiness. It means the destruction  of my mind. It means death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  was alarmed, but felt powerless in my wish to pacify him.</p>
<p>I  did my best, however, and actually dragged him to the sofa and forced him to  sit down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,  Charley, you are generally a sensible fellow. You have had enough to make you  miserable, and I cannot expect you to bear what you have gone through with  calmness; but try to think as little as you can upon your unhappiness to-night.  Although I am risking something in my desire for your comfort, I cannot credit  the assertion that Grace participates in the cruel course which her father has  chosen to adopt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  seized my hand and wrung it, with a glitter in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am  going,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;to Wimbledon to-morrow. I am in Mr. Eveleigh&rsquo;s  confidence, as you know; and if I see my opportunity of serving you in any way,  you may rely upon it that I will seize the occasion. Do nothing until you see  me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charley  pressed my hand, took his hat, and went to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is going on to-morrow?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  garden party of some kind,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>He  hesitated a moment, and compressed his ashy lips as if some painful thought was  passing through his mind, but he said no more; and as I lighted him out I was  pained to see the uncertain and feeble manner of his gait as he walked down the  path and pursued his way home.</p>
<p>I  turned into bed shortly afterward, and had a wretched night. If I slept for a  few minutes, it was only to awake with a sense of some overwhelming calamity  about to occur, so much was I attached to Charley, so keenly did I appreciate  the pangs which he had suffered.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3<br>
  A Mystery</strong></h2>
<p>The  next day, on my way to my chambers, the uncomfortable feelings which had so  much oppressed my mind after the departure of Charley came back upon me in  great force, and I reproached myself with not having given him a shake-down at  my lodgings, or at least having insisted upon accompanying him a part of the  way home, seeing, as I had too plainly seen, that he was so shaken, so  depressed, and despairing. After dispatching some pressing business, I took a  hasty lunch and was about to go out, when my clerk brought me a post letter. It  was from the assurance office to which I had introduced Charley, and I  concluded that it conveyed the decision of the directors upon his proposition.  It was addressed to him to my care (as he had directed), so I slipped it into  my pocket, and taking a hansom, was soon spinning along the Bayswater Road to  Charley&rsquo;s studio, where I felt sure I should meet him. The day was showery,  gusty, and altogether disagreeable, and the leaden-hued sky gave an  indescribable look of dreariness and desolation to every object around; perhaps  the depression of my spirits lent greater power to the atmospheric gloom. It  was with an uncomfortable feeling that I tapped at the door of the studio, and,  hearing no response, I opened it and looked in.</p>
<p>Charley  arose dreamily from a sofa, with the air of one who had undergone a long  night&rsquo;s unhappy vigil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have not been home, I fear, Charley,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.  I could not go. The shock had quite unmanned me. I was afraid to meet my  mother&rsquo;s look, with my sensation of disgrace and disappointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disappointment,  indeed, Charley; but no disgrace&mdash;at least, on your side.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he answered, vehemently. &ldquo;If I have, with the energy inspired by the purest and  most honest love God ever vouchsafed to human being, attained a position where  such a reward as I had sought was fairly won, and have had my prize denied me,  what is it but a bitter reflection upon me, a dismal reproof for my audacity?  Oh, Tom, a dark fear has come upon me that I must have had a double life; a  visionary existence, and a real but unknown one, which in its deformities must  have rendered me abhorrent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  showed an ugly and painful phase in the unquiet which had so disturbed his  nature. Heaven knows, when such analyses of the mind commence, what fatal  effect they may produce in a highly sensitive constitution.</p>
<p>I  hastened to distract his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you won&rsquo;t take my advice,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;to rest as calmly as you can to-day, and  wait patiently until I have seen Mr. Eveleigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  name seemed to send a shiver through his frame.</p>
<p>Again,  to distract him, I handed him the letter which I had received from the  assurance office. He took it, opened it dreamily, and had hardly cast his eyes  over it when his old mood returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  life is declined,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What can this conspiracy mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  truth, the surprise was equally mine. His life was considered hazardous; but  why so, the confidence of such societies of course precluded any enlightenment.  In my opinion he was the healthiest subject I could have selected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  can all this plot mean?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why, Tom, has not our long friendship taught  you to have acquainted me candidly with my delusive existence? I am despised  and rejected by all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will not hear you talk so,&rdquo; I answered. &ldquo;In this last matter I am as surprised  as yourself. Heaven knows that my testimony, as your referee, if relied upon,  had no share in this unexpected decision. Boards are capricious sometimes. I  have known cross countrymen, tandem-drivers, and rackety young noblemen  welcomed, and artists like yourself refused, as pursuing an unhealthy  occupation, the sapient chairman having noticed in some statistical work that  painters and plumbers exhibited a remarkable depreciation of life,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  was glad to see him (as I had intended) smile at this as he said hurriedly,  &ldquo;Well, well, remember your promise to see me after&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will, I assure you,&rdquo; I interrupted. &ldquo;I will leave early, and look in upon you  to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  do you assemble?&rdquo; he said in a tone, as I fancied, of assumed carelessness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall go down at six or seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking  up my hat to leave, I turned to his large easel, upon which was his new and  beautiful subject, &ldquo;Cymon and Iphigenia,&rdquo; which critics who had the privilege  of seeing the painting in progress prognosticated would eclipse all his former  efforts, </p>
<p>Charley  came by my side as I was admiring it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  will be the next bubble which will burst,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After the recent events I  expect it fully. The art world will brand me an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  this case,&rdquo; I observed, &ldquo;your very rivals in art have been enthusiastic in your  favor, or in the public papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  much the greater will be my fall,&rdquo; he said, with a look almost of horror in his  face, &ldquo;when the time for public estimate of my work arrives. No, Tom, I will  not exhibit. By heavens, as I look I see faults every where&mdash;the coloring and  composition are all false!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  look of horror was mingled now with one of intense pain.</p>
<p>I  had to force him away from the easel, and, having talked him into a calmer  frame of mind, made him promise that he would not touch his work until I came  back to him, nor see any visitors in the interval. This latter promise I made  secure by telling his servant to admit no one.</p>
<p>Heaven  knows I anticipated but scant amusement from the gathering at Wimbledon.  Croquet was quite out of my line, and out door amusements of every description  I have always regarded as delusions and snares under our unsettled skies. It  really grieved me to see the groups of elegant and lightly clad ladies, as the  evening drew on, energetically maintaining their ground upon a lawn moist with  the morning showers. I moved from one part to another in search of my host, and  after some time was fortunate enough to find him. He greeted me cordially, but  seemed out of spirits. He had a lady with him, to whom he introduced me; and  then sent us off to the orchard, where he said his nephew Rupert had taken  charge of some sports of an exciting nature, and there was a sly twinkle in Mr.  Eveleigh&rsquo;s eyes as he transferred his fair companion to me. Had he but known  the preoccupied condition of my mind, I think he would have appreciated the  full force of the infliction he imposed upon me.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Deyne was a &ldquo;<em>blas bleu</em>&rdquo; of the  deepest tint. In matters of theology she crushed her husband, a D.D. of some  repute, which was saying a good deal. For inferior mortals she was simply a  Nasymth&rsquo;s steam hammer, without its power of accommodation of force. She would  select her victim with the utmost refinement of art; she would lure him on to  touch upon some subject of mild and ordinary speculation. Rash mortal! In a few  minutes he finds himself plunged in a seething ocean of abstruse philosophy.  With the theories of all the sophists of antiquity permeating her veins, with  Platonic intricacies and Aristotelian ethics saturating her brain, she would  pound away until her unfortunate auditor was reduced, according to his  constitution, to a state of utter imbecility or temporary madness.</p>
<p>We  left the croquet players, entered a very tastefully arranged flower garden,  and, through a handsomely designed gate at the extremity, entered the orchard.  Shocking! Rupert had had the audacity to set up some Aunt Sallies, and was  superintending the game, which was joined in by a bevy of young ladies in the  most <em>recherche</em> toilets.</p>
<p>So  far from the exhibition shocking (as I hoped it would) the divine&rsquo;s wife, as  she gazed, a thoughtful smile spread itself over her countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  forcibly,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;comes to my mind the remark of the great philosopher,  when Pheseaedo&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  was well aimed, was it not?&rdquo; I interrupted, as a little beauty made a  successful hit; but I might have spoken to the wooden head of Aunt Sally with  equal chance of attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  true it is,&rdquo; she proceeded with the quotation, &ldquo;that objects perceived by the  senses induce a reflection upon things comprehended by the mind alone, and  which have no sensitive existence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  Heaven, here comes Florence to my rescue,&rdquo; I mentally ejaculated, as the lad&rsquo;s  sister came up with her pretty arms full of sticks for throwing at the figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t  you try your skill?&rdquo; she said to me.</p>
<p>I  gave a grateful look; but I was morally handcuffed by the learned woman, and  taken off in custody down a secluded walk that bounded the orchard; and I felt  like a human fly, in the web of this philosophic female spider.</p>
<p>Again  she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  giddy group which we have just left, the laughter which even now is ringing in  our ears, leads a reflecting mind to speculate whether, in these degenerate  days, we are gradually falling into the views of Gicero (in his academics),  that pleasure is the boundary of all good things; that the chief object in life  is to live agreeably,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse  me, Mrs. Devne,&rdquo; I again interrupted; &ldquo;but there is a caterpillar upon your  shawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; she said, as I flicked it off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Greeks have their &lsquo;telos&rsquo; to signify the highest and extremest aim&mdash;a good and  expressive word, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Affectingly  so,&rdquo; I answered, in a state of fast-approaching imbecility. On she went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  Epicurus considered pleasure not to be a mere transitory sensation, but a pure  mental enjoyment, far loftier, in his idea, than the Cyrenaics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely  that was a raindrop, Mrs. Deyne,&rdquo; I broke in; &ldquo;I must not let you run the risk  of remaining out here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  few drops had fallen, and the shower set in. I drew her arm within mine; we  retraced our steps, and entered the fernery.</p>
<p>Here  we found Grace; the fernery was her own peculiar charge. A very fair botanist,  she had collected the rarest and most beautiful of the English species, and had  arranged and labeled the specimens with infinite care.</p>
<p>I  watched her anxiously as she was directing the attention of the little group  around her to some peculiar plants. Her manner, usually expressive of supreme  repose, seemed nervous and hurried. She talked rapidly upon her subject, as if  she was bent upon an effort to occupy her mind with any matter rather than  leave an interval for the recurrence of some unpleasant thoughts, and (as it  seemed to me) she was tortured with a consciousness of a cruel wrong she had  done, and of a life of promise stricken through her fickleness.</p>
<p>I  shook hands with her, and I could feel how feverish was her touch. She knew  what a bosom friend I was of Charley&rsquo;s. She faltered out a reply to some  commonplace observation of mine, and turned to her other friends with an effort  to reassume her enforced liveliness.</p>
<p>I  felt quite shocked at her manner, knowing what a burden was upon my mind, what  a wreck I had left behind in London, and how utterly improbable it was that I  could do anything to revive the shattered hopes of my friend.</p>
<p>The  rain had now increased so much that a general stampede took place across the  lawn into the house. I observed Grace to linger behind, saying that she would  follow in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Much  as I longed for some signal to remain, in the hope that she might afford me  some clew to her strange conduct to Charley &mdash;some hope that I might be  intrusted with a message, precious to him&mdash;she gave no response to my glance.</p>
<p>Before  we reached the shelter of the house sounds of music told us that dancing was  going on, and my philosophic female, who had never left me, was, to my intense  relief, carried off by Mr. Eveleigh to complete a whist-table; and on Mr.  Eveleigh&rsquo;s return he thanked me heartily, with a wicked smile, for having taken  such care of Mrs. Devne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have certainly escaped with my life,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;My brain has received a shock,  but time may restore its equilibrium.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing  so good for that as a dance,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;as for me, I will just run into the  library for half an hour or so&mdash;you know we city men cannot always leave the  shop behind in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here  was my opportunity; I would give him a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s quiet, and then  make my way to his sanctum; but I never did. Hardly a minute had elapsed since  he left my side before a piercing shriek rang through the garden, and its tones  vibrated in the room. For an instant afterward a dead silence prevailed. The  music ceased instantly, and the dancers stood motionless. A lady near the piano  fainted, and then a movement was made toward the conservatory, which opened  from the drawing-room on to the lawn.</p>
<p>I  was the first to move, and led the way to the fernery, my brain impressed with  a dreadful conviction of some fearful catastrophe, knowing what I did. In the  tumult of thought aroused by the sudden cry, the unnatural calmness of  Charley&rsquo;s manner, when he asked me what time the <em>fete</em> was to commence, came into my mind. That he had made his way  hither I now felt assured; and in his frenzied state what might not have  happened?</p>
<p>We  reached the fernery and found Grace lying, a heap of white muslin across the  entrance. She was borne in-doors and carried to her own room. I only remained  to hear that she had recovered from her swoon, and, seizing my hat, left the  house. That Charley had been down was my mental conviction. I resolved to find  him, and try what I could do to restore the tone of that nature which had been  made so discordant; alas! how little I understood, how little the wisest of us  comprehend, the mysterious workings of a mind so wounded.</p>
<p>A  train was moving out as I dashed into the Wimbledon station, so that I had to  wait for the next one&mdash;a long time, it seemed to me; and, although a quick  train, the stoppages appeared to me more frequent and longer than ordinary, and  the hansom which bore me from the terminus to Bayswater seemed intolerably  slow.</p>
<p>At  his private house the servant said she had seen nothing of her master for two  whole days, so I took my way at once to the studio. The man who admitted me  looked scared and anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am so glad you have come, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Fawcett has been so strange ever  since you left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is  he within?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is in the painting-room; but he has been like a wild creature ever since he  came in, about an hour since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  expression, as applied to one who was the gentlest of beings, and the very  embodiment of an amiable and thoughtful nature, jarred harshly upon my  feelings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  God, he has at least got back,&rdquo; I mentally ejaculated, as I turned the handle  of the door.</p>
<p>Charley  seemed quiet enough now, as I beheld him in his old attitude, astride of a  chair before his large painting, the pendent lights being concentrated upon the  canvas.</p>
<p>His  eyes, however, were not scanning his handiwork; they seemed in their intense  gaze to pierce beyond the limits of the room into some dream-world.</p>
<p>I  laid my hand upon his shoulder, and roused him from his mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have seen her,&rdquo; were his first words, &ldquo;and all now is over &mdash;oh! that I could  only lay my memory in the grave, where my hopes are buried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time,  Charley,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;will make you think less bitterly upon this great wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have no bitter thoughts regarding her now,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she is free from me. Her  father&rsquo;s decision was her own choice. The idol is destroyed, and lies among the  ruins of my wrecked hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  some moments he was silent, but I observed his features working. He started up,  and thrusting his chair aside, glared upon his masterpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  now loath the very sight of this vile daub,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;By Heaven! I will not  let the public have a hand in any farther disgrace to me;&rdquo; and, seizing a knife  from a table near, he slashed the canvas across again and again, until his  beautiful work hung down in strips. I had no time to arrest his hand, and I  felt as if an act of sacrilege had been committed. The ruin was complete.</p>
<p>I  sat with him for two hours, and felt so convinced that an absolute change of  scene was necessary to him, that I proposed and urged, his accompanying me on  my holiday trip.</p>
<p>The  destruction of his handiwork was the last outbreak of feeling which I noticed  in him, and from the moment it was effected, he gradually calmed down, and  listened like a child to my plans.</p>
<p>He  fell in with them, in a listless manner, and assented to my scheme. I tried to  persuade him to take with him a portable case of his painting materials, but he  objected so strongly that I forbore to persist.</p>
<p>I  left him, then, upon his undertaking to go to his house to make the necessary  arrangements, and I agreed to meet him there on the morrow. As I was being let  out I told his servant to get Charley&rsquo;s traveling case of materials, and send  them on to my address.</p>
<p>I  had now strong hopes of seeing Charley the same Charley that he had been  before.</p>
<p>I  little knew, however, at that time, the extent of the injury he had suffered; I  knew little of the working of the wonderful machinery of hidden nature, even in  its normal state.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 4<br>
  What The Sketch Foretold</strong></h2>
<p>My  arrangements were soon completed, and I had plenty of time to see that Charley  was equally in traveling order. I was glad to see him back again at his house,  and with somewhat of his old cheerfulness. Perhaps this was assumed for the  sake of his mother, whom he loved devotedly; for his affectionate instinct was  intense, and it was only when we were about to leave, and he embraced the old  lady, that the scared look and the painful shiver told of the deep wound which  still rankled, and how much he had striven to stifle its pangs.</p>
<p>We  started, The day was uncommonly fine, and the bustle of the railway and the  confusion and hurry at Southampton assisted to divert thought from dwelling  upon unpleasant themes.</p>
<p>The  excellent arrangements of the P. and O. steamers are too well known to require  any additional testimony from me as to the comfort which we enjoyed in our  passage to Gibraltar, which we reached in eight days, and from which point we  felt that our real traveling commenced.</p>
<p>In  my determination to leave no time unoccupied for opportunity to Charley to  brood upon the past, I saw more than I otherwise should. From the garrison  library to the signal staff, on the summit of the rock; from O&rsquo;Hara&rsquo;s Tower and  the excavations, to the shore bastions and the Alameda, we were on the  perpetual tramp, and returned, tired enough, to our quarters at Griffith&rsquo;s  Hotel, where Charley soon retired to rest. I then sauntered into the  coffee-room, to pick up any hints that might serve us as to the best plan of  proceeding upon our trip, and was fortunate enough to meet with the son of an  American merchant long established in Gibraltar, and who had made frequent  excursions to Grenada. Ascertaining that we merely contemplated a pleasure  excursion, he advised us by all means to hire horses; and next morning he  selected our steeds, provided us with saddle-bags, and gave useful instructions  as to our halting-places. Following his plan, we took the bridle-road along the  coast to Malaga, and he accompanied us as far as Estepona, a good day&rsquo;s ride; a  guide went on with us from thence to Malaga, and there we dismissed him.</p>
<p>Beautiful  and romantic as was the scenery through which we passed, and entrancing as it  ought to have been to the eye of an artist, I was grieved at the indifference  and apathy exhibited by Charley. He behaved as if he was passively enduring a  set task. As for myself, every object had an interest, from the natural scenery  to the groups of peasants, the bronzed &ldquo;arrieros,&rdquo; and the well-fed priests.</p>
<p>By  an American friend&rsquo;s advice we put up at Malaga at the Cuatro Naciones, where  we met several of our countrymen, and I saw every prospect of our passing a few  agreeable days prior to our start for Grenada; but, alas! poor Charley, from  listlessness had now sunk down almost to lethargy. He shunned our excursions,  he avoided all intercourse with our chatty, pleasant fellow-guests, would have  all his meals in his own room, and all our efforts to arouse him to take an  interest in the place were unavailing. One day I purposely left Charley&rsquo;s box  of painting materials exposed in our sitting-room, and on my return from an  excursion to the beautiful little village of Torremolinos was gratified to  observe that it had disappeared, encouraging my hope that he had repented his  resolution to abandon his profession. Had then the glorious panorama of wild  nature, which I fancied had passed before him unheeded, exercised a benign  influence upon a mind so capable of appreciating its glories, and was the dawn  about to break of a reviving enthusiasm in his profession? Alas! like many  others my hopes were but the offspring of my heartfelt wishes.</p>
<p>I  took no notice of what I had seen until we were <em>en route</em> for Alhama, and then the poor fellow seemed cowed when I  alluded to the facilities which I had surreptitiously supplied him with for  preserving some memorials of his journey. I little knew then what fixed  determination was in his brain. I only fancied that some shame at his  irresolution had caused him pain. At Velez, Malaga, we breakfasted and baited  our animals, and in an hour or two after resuming our road reached the romantic  town of Alhama, where we put up for the night at the best &ldquo;posada.&rdquo; I cannot say  that we slept much, for the accommodation was of the worst class, and fully  bore out the description given of it by our Malaga acquaintances.</p>
<p>We  arose early the next morning to view the Baths, and to survey the picturesque  appearance of the town, and were off again on our descent toward Grenada:  through a deep gorge, through the little village of Corein, then an ascent to  La Mala, and we enter the Vega of Malaga, surrounded by the Sierra Nevada.</p>
<p>I  had provided myself with a note-book, in order that I might jot down such  scenes and incidents of the journey as I wished to preserve for reference upon  my return. The occurrences of strange travel have to me an interest beyond that  afforded by their immediate enjoyment, and the pleasure of musing upon  past-viewed scenery, the recalling of objects that have attracted me, has always  given me feelings of gratification; but, alas! the anxiety which I felt on my  dear friend&rsquo;s account occupied my mind too much to give me leisure to have  recourse to its pages &mdash;save to book my expenses, and to enter a few useful  sentences, in the Spanish language, which proved on several occasions of some  value.</p>
<p>As  I anticipated at least a week&rsquo;s stay in Grenada, we located ourselves at a good  hotel, La Armistad, and, after a slight repast, tired as I was and late the  hour, I could not resist sallying forth to glance around, while Charley lay  down upon the sofa completely done up.</p>
<p>I  found, even in the imperfect light, that all my anticipations were realized to  the fullest. I could have lingered for hours over the scenery; but anxious that  my friend should not be left too much alone, I returned soon to the hotel, and,  running up to our apartment, found Charley seated at the table with his  sketching materials before him, and a sheet of drawing-paper spread out, upon  which he was busily engaged. My entrance disturbed him, and he hastily rolled  up his sketch, and closed the tin case which held his colors.</p>
<p>Delighted  at the imagined success of my <em>ruse</em> in  my attempt to revive his old art-love, I was about to express my feelings, when  I noticed a change in his countenance which sent a cold chill to my heart. I am  utterly at a loss how to express this change, otherwise than by saying that his  physiognomy exhibited a painful alteration; the listlessness and apathy which I  had before noticed were now wanting, and the expression was that of cunning and  deceit.</p>
<p>Before  I had time to recover from the shock which this appearance caused me, he had,  without uttering a word, borne his work away, and I saw no more of him that  night.</p>
<p>Uneasy,  and with a vague, indefinable feeling of disappointment, I retired to my own  room, and, thinking over plans and schemes that might tend to restore poor  Charley to his normal condition, I fell asleep, my little oil-lamp still  burning upon a table at the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>I  fancy I must have slumbered for an hour when a slight creaking of the door  aroused me, no result following. I dozed again and awoke with an overpowering  sensation of trouble. The door was now wide open, and between it and where I  lay I saw Charley seated upon a chair assiduously engaged upon sketching me. As  my eyes fell upon him he arose silently and glided from the room.</p>
<p>This  seemed, indeed, mysterious to me. I had no more sleep that night, my brain was  so busy; in endeavoring to account for the strange proceeding morning came.  Charley evidently had not slept; I doubt much whether he had even undressed,  and the cunning air and cowed look were, if possible, even more painfully  obvious.</p>
<p>He  was another being; he was not the same Charley of our former days, and I felt  it a great relief when I started out alone, and devoted the entire day to the  Alhambra.</p>
<p>I  have not the heart to describe the glories of that visit; but in the midst of  the great trouble which I felt, that I can own to a day of wonder, that I  experienced sensations of the most absorbing interest, these sensations testify  to the attractions of a place viewed under the depression of anxious feelings,  and the sense of vague horror of some calamity, the signs of which loomed  oppressively in some not far-off distance. What shape it would assume I could  not even guess.</p>
<p>Charley  used to be devotedly fond of chess, and having mentioned the fact casually to  our host, Don Jose, he snapped him up immediately for a tournament with the  medico, Dr, Favargo, who lived next door. Charley, to my surprise, accepted the  offer, and I left the two in the patio at the doctor&rsquo;s house, Charley promising  to be home early, as we had to make our plans for the operations of the next  day.</p>
<p>I  was glad of this opportunity as a mental experiment for my poor friend, and  hoped that the combinations of thought in this game would be a beneficial  exercise to him. Jose and I smoked a cigar together in his sanctum, and, when  alone again, I drew out my note-book to enter up a few arrears of memoranda.  Involuntarily the recollection of the mysterious proceedings of the last night  came into my mind, and, with it, the old forebodings of calamity, which pressed  upon me so heavily that I made up my mind to go to Charley&rsquo;s room and endeavor  to satisfy myself as to the subject of his stealthy sketch.</p>
<p>His  saddle-bags lay upon the floor, quite empty; the few things that he had brought  with him lay upon a chair, the drawing upon which he had been engaged was  nowhere to be seen. Why should he carry it about with him? or, if he had  concealed it, what could be his reason for secrecy?</p>
<p>The  search in the room was a very simple matter, for the furniture, besides the  bed, consisted only of a rickety table, a walnut set of drawers, and three or  four cane-seated chairs. The drawers were quite empty. There were three framed  engravings upon the walls&mdash;a portrait of Queen Isabella, a scene from &ldquo;Don  Quixote,&rdquo; and a Spanish naval battle. This latter did not lie flat on the wall;  and taking hold of the lower portion of the frame to see what was the cause, a  rolled-up paper, hitherto confined by the pressure of the picture, fell to the  ground. &ldquo;Here was the mysterious sketch, I thought. In the act of unrolling it  a common table-knife fell out of it to the ground. I then had never in my life  experienced such a painful shock. Executed in colors, barely dried, was my own  likeness, but with the pallor of a corpse, and hideous with a cruel gash across  my throat.</p>
<p>Poor  fellow! it was not the work of my real Charley. With that mysterious instinct  of a disorganized reason which plots the destruction of those whom, in sane  moments, it most loves, his hand, with insane assiduity, had pictured the  realization of its mad infatuation.</p>
<p>This  was the secret of his stealthy work! Perhaps, in the wavering moods of his  tottering reason, he had been endeavoring to familiarize himself with the  likeness which his morbid feelings convinced himself I must soon assume.</p>
<p>I  felt fairly beaten down. My friend&rsquo;s disease had assumed so terrible, so  hopeless a shape. I leaned my head upon the mantelpiece and fairly wept. I  looked again at the ghastly painting, to see if any hope could be extracted,  and as I placed it before me, holding the oil-lamp to shed its light upon it, I  was sensible of a stealthy tread in the room, and a warm breath upon my neck.</p>
<p>I  turned round, and was face to face with the painter of this horror. His eyes  were dilated to their fullest extent. But one instant he faced me, and then,  with a shriek which even now seems to vibrate in my ears, he sprung from me, and,  dashing with all his force against the small-paned windows, burst them open,  and fell to the ground outside amid a shiver of glass.</p>
<p>I  rushed down-stairs and out of the hotel to the spot where I expected to find  his crushed body; but, to my unspeakable surprise, he was to be found nowhere.</p>
<p>Don  Jose, and a waiter or two, alarmed by the crash, had by this time joined me,  and we set out with speed, under the guidance of the don.</p>
<p>We  ran up the frightfully paved street, and, passing under a dark and frowning archway  within the precincts of the Alhambra, overtook two priests who were  gesticulating violently. From them we learned that the unhappy young man had  rushed furiously past them a minute or so since, and that the object of our  search was lost in the gloom, in advance of them. He was streaming with blood,  they said, and staggering in his run. As we continued our way, and almost  before Don Jose had finished his interpretation of their words, the foremost  priest, who accompanied us, stumbled over an object that lay in his path&mdash;the  body of my dear friend.</p>
<p>A  sad and weary procession we made back to the hotel. Returning life flickered  fitfully in the poor maimed body, under stimulants applied by Dr. Favargo, who  attended Charley immediately that we carried him to his room; and I heard him  indistinctly, as the unmistakable hue of death was falling like a veil upon his  features, murmur the name of &ldquo;Grace,&rdquo; as if the reason which his great love had  cost him reasserted its dominion one brief moment, ere his good and faithful  heart had ceased to beat.</p>
<p>Dr.  Favargo. who was a fair English scholar, told me, before he took his leave of  us, that it was perfectly marvelous how, with the mortal injuries which poor  Charley had received, he had accomplished such a flight.</p>
<p>Next  day, Don Jose, in the kindest manner, saw to the completion of various  documents relative to the unfortunate catastrophe; and under the painful ordeal  which I had to undergo before the local authorities. I had the kind sympathy  and support of two American travelers, who purposely delayed their journey to  Seville to render me all the assistance which their experience, derived from a  protracted tour in Spain, could afford; and the day after I started on my  return to Malaga, with the body of my poor friend, in a rough vehicle, the only  one which I could engage for the entire journey to carry such a burden.</p>
<p>Arrived  at Malaga, I placed the remains in the Protestant burial-ground.</p>
<p>I  had, in my dismal journey, thought of making such arrangements at Malaga that  my friend&rsquo;s body might be brought to England, should his many admirers feel a  wish to pay that posthumous respect and honor due to his eminent talents and  his estimable private virtues; but, upon reflection, I felt that such a course  might lead to a revelation of circumstances so saddening that I conceived the  course which I had adopted was the most judicious.</p>
<p>I  packed up the few things which we had brought with us, took a berth in one of  the steamers of Lopez &amp; Co., and, reaching Gibraltar, collected the heavier  effects which we had left there, and next day was on board a P. and O. steamer,  on my way back to England.</p>
<p>I  am again at home&mdash;a sad enough return to me. The task of breaking the terrible  news to Mrs. Fawcett should not be delayed. The shocking details I felt might  be passed over in silence. I never had been very intimate with that lady; I  believe that since her husband&rsquo;s death she had given herself up to a stern  melancholy, and I often used to think, when I saw her, that the exercise of her  rigid ideas upon religious duty might bear tempering somewhat with social  conciliations, with a more affectionate yearning toward a son who loved her so  devotedly.</p>
<p>She  bore the news like a Spartan matron, and her taciturnity spared me the  necessity of entering into painful details.</p>
<p>I  thought now of the last name uttered by Charley, and felt that before Mr.  Eveleigh or his daughter might learn the terrible news through a public  channel, it would be well for me to run down to Wimbledon and see him.</p>
<p>I  lost no time, and on my arrival went straight to his library.</p>
<p>He  arose, and shook me warmly by the hand. I inquired after Grace, and was grieved  to see the dejected look which fell upon him, as his eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  sad, sad business,&rdquo; he said, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &ldquo;but God knows I acted as  I deemed for the best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seriously,  I fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know the story,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;You are aware that I was poor Charley&rsquo;s dearest  friend; we were like brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  and a worthy good fellow he is. How does he bear the disappointment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is past all trouble now. He died in Grenada. Had he lived on we might, with the  memory of his lost, bright intellect, have mercifully wished him in the quiet  grave wherein I laid him at Malaga.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Eveleigh looked inexpressibly shocked at the news, and, laying his hand gently  on my arm, said, &ldquo;Was I not justified, in his interest, in the interest of my  dear Grace, in the interest of possible descendants, in my apparently harsh  treatment in rejecting his suit for her hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  looked anxiously at him. &ldquo;But it was that shock which caused the wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  so,&rdquo; said the old gentleman. &ldquo;The shock, which I strove by every means in my  power to soften, only served to develop the seeds of his malady. Perhaps you  never heard of the real facts of his father&rsquo;s death. He destroyed himself in a  fit of insanity. His uncle, kindly spoken of as an eccentric being, was a  dangerous lunatic, and for many of the later years of his life was under  restraint. A generation further back exhibited similar painful cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  certainly had never heard of these facts. Poor Charley never alluded to his  predecessors; and, as regards his father, I had only heard that he had died  suddenly, Charley being then but a boy. I had never, during my long, close  intimacy with my dear friend, noticed an act incompatible with the best-balanced mind.</p>
<p>I  felt, however, now that I had received the information from Mr. Eveleigh, how  true it was that a hereditary curse had clung to his race; that the disease  which had lain dormant only awaited some disturbing influence to develop  itself.</p>
<p>The  skillful eye of the medical gentleman, on the occasion of his contemplated  scheme for his mother&rsquo;s comfort, had detected some latent ill, confirmed, no  doubt, by information obtained in the usual course from the family doctor; and  hence the rejection of his life.</p>
<p>I  have little more to add. Grace recovered her health slowly, but she remained  single, and true to the memory of the foredoomed lover to whom she had given  her young heart.</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="HowWeMarry"></a>How We Marry</strong></h1>
<p>Christmas  at Belletowers, how she had looked forward for it! No wonder either,  considering what her life was. Nora&rsquo;s was not a family where love and harmony  softened the thorny point of poverty. A broken-down speculator, and a <em>ci-devant</em> beauty who had never been  anything but a beauty, are not promising materials for the manufacture of an  edifying elderly couple. A sister whose indifferent disposition had been made  detestable by bad bringing up, and by her failure at the competitive examination  by the beaux of the county to pass as a belle at the assize ball which it had  been settled was to decide her fate; two ne&rsquo;er-do-well loutish brothers; and,  to crown all, a young female demon in short frocks, who, being apparently the  only thing her parents loved, took unceasing delight in torturing with  precocious ingenuity all those whom they did not love; a houndish form of  gratitude&mdash;such were Nora Boynton&rsquo;s family. But she was god-daughter to her  second cousin, Lord Belletowers. That good-natured nobleman had long since been  cured of any interest he might have taken in the rest of the family. An un-intermittent  desire to borrow his money&mdash;borrow!&mdash;and, worse still, to wash their dirty linen  in his presence, had disgusted him with the impecunious brood. He and his wife,  however, had taken a fancy to the pretty Nora as a child, and still  occasionally sent her a five-pound note to buy herself a birthday or Christmas  present.</p>
<p>But  Belletowers is in Devon, and the Boyntons vegetate in Yorkshire; so that they  seldom or never met, save when his lordship paid his biennial visit to his  northern possessions, and then he would send over his housekeeper, some ten  miles, in a gig, to fetch the young damsel out for a treat, very coolly, but  not unjustifiably, ignoring the rest of the family. As Nora approached  womanhood, however, these jaunts well-nigh ceased.</p>
<p>The  welcome fivers, too, had become rarer and rarer; for his lordship, in common  with most of his noble <em>confreres</em>, was  a great sufferer by the hard times the farmers were having. He had, moreover, a  large family of his own, and he gradually told himself that justice forbade his  indulging to any serious degree in the luxury of a goddaughter whom he had  thought, under more affluent circumstances, of providing with a moderate dower.</p>
<p>It  had been arranged, however, that Nora was to visit her noble kinsman&rsquo;s roof in  Devon for the first time, in order to assist at the Christmas festivities,  which were expected to be more than usually brilliant that year. There was to  be a play in the house, in which she was to take a small part, her first  attempt in that line.</p>
<p>Whether  it was that the distant sunshine from the sponsorial towers had reached and  softened her, or that some long-dead progenitor had transmitted to her a  gentler nature than the rest, our heroine was certainly a very nice little girl  of eighteen; and so everybody thought as she joined the distinguished circle at  five-o&rsquo;clock tea on the day the long-looked-forward-to party assembled. She  came quite alone, to be under the chaperonage of Lady Belletowers. Her journey  was performed third-class, for, though a ten-pound note had been inclosed with  the invitation, for traveling expenses, every spare penny was required to put  her very modest wardrobe upon a war-footing; every girl, when she sets sail  from her native harbor, being, of course, more or less, on conquest bent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir  Paul, let me introduce you to my cousin, Miss Boynton,&rdquo; said the hostess, who  had kissed Nora quite as a matter of course on her arrival.</p>
<p>The  accolade and &ldquo;my cousin.&rdquo; the girl thought, gave her rank in the house at once,  and removed all dread of the poor-relation reception she had feared might await  her.</p>
<p>As  Sir Paul is only saying the most commonplace things&mdash; though no one says them  more pleasantly&mdash;we will look at him for a moment instead of listening. He is  one of those men to whom grayness is a godsend. There is a <em>distingue</em> twist about those temple locks which may not be quite  artless, but their decided gray accentuates, as nothing else could do, the freshness  and fine chiseling of a face which has at least seen five-and-forty summers.  His figure is elegance itself, and his light-drab traveling suit is of  faultless make.</p>
<p>Nora,  however, sees none of these perfections. The cursory and inexperienced glance of  youth had told her the baronet was an old fogy&mdash;forty is so old to eighteen&mdash;and  it was not to meet such that she had traveled third-class for all those miles  in cold December weather. Her family had bade her adieu with an implied, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  come back if you can help it,&rdquo; in every tone and gesture. Nor was it wonderful  that for once she should wish to comply with their behests.</p>
<p>There  is a golden-haired young stripling in black velvet, all a-sprawl upon the  ottoman, who has already caught her eye.</p>
<p>To  quote a real, live, young&mdash;very young&mdash;lady we heard say it, &ldquo;<em>he</em> is more the sort of looking man;&rdquo; and  with delightful impudence he is already telling her&mdash;though in full parley with  a rival beauty&mdash;that he loves her, with his eyes.</p>
<p>So  familiar are his smiling glances that Nora at first fancies she must have known  him somewhere, and is surprised into smiling back. Then she blushes at her  mistake; yet cannot, for the life of her, feel angry with him.</p>
<p>And  now she overhears an old dowager at her elbow, deliberately ordering her  granddaughter to make a dead set at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heir  to a barony, enormous rent-roll, his mother dying for him to marry. Babley, my  dear&mdash;B-a-b-l-e-y&mdash;eh! yes, I know, not a pretty name; stuff and nonsense. How  dare you giggle, miss? What do surnames matter, when you have a title like De  Porchington?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  was sitting very quietly sipping her tea in a corner near the fire. She was  tired from her long journey, moreover a little shy; but nevertheless she was  gleaning; and scraps of information from the sheaves of knowledge anent people  and things dropped here and there by different members of that aristocratic  house might prove very useful in the future.</p>
<p>She  looked once more across the room at the future Lord de Porchington, and smiled  as she thought, &ldquo;If he admires me now in my dusty traveling clothes, what will  he think of me presently in my white silk with the gladiolus flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Babley  took the smile directly for himself, and getting up from his half-recumbent  position beside Miss Chevenix he lounged to the fireplace; by this deliberate  act sowing the seeds of hatred in the Chevenix heart toward the fair intruder,  making Sir Paul mentally designate him &ldquo;an impertinent young puppy,&rdquo; and  awakening with intent in Nora&rsquo;s heart the beginning of her first romance.</p>
<p>Half  an hour afterward, when she has been shown her room, and with the assistance of  Lady Belletower&rsquo;s second maid she is unpacking the greatest wealth of earthly  possessions she has ever yet known, they already fade into comparative  littleness as she pictures to herself the wonderful toilets she may one day  display as the wife of the rich Lord de Porchington. But she cannot afford time  to build air-castles. She must don the white silk triumph of north-country art,  and be ready when Lady Belletowers sends for her, which she has promised to do,  in order that she may chaperone her into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Neither  Sir Paul nor Babley are in the room. Still some half-dozen or so of the party  have assembled, and Nora feels all her shyness come back when she finds herself  in a little knot of women who seem to depress her by the ease of their manners,  and their off-hand superiority. Her nervousness reaches its climax when she  distinctly hears Miss Chevenix remark to a very plain little Miss Despreaux&mdash;the  heiress of the party&mdash;&ldquo;that the new cousin is badly dressed, and wants style!&rdquo;  Badly dressed! poor Nora. What severer trial to a girl who has spent all her  money and energies for weeks on her toilets, even to not sleeping at nights, in  order to plan the dresses for Christmas, than to be told she is badly dressed?  Babley came in at this juncture. Miss Chevenix pounced upon him forthwith, with  a request that he would sing that divine ballad about &ldquo;The Curls of Jove&rdquo; to  them after dinner; but he cast an approving look at Nora, as though to say <em>he</em> thought she looked divine. The blood  rushed back to her heart, and she was happy: five seconds ago she felt so  wretched that she was contemplating flight under pretext of a headache.</p>
<p>Dinner  was announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir  Paul, will you take in my young cousin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  baronet seemed nothing loath. Nora looked at Babley presently when they were  all seated. He sat, however, a long way from her on the same side of the table;  she could not even see him during dinner, so she talked simply and pleasantly  to Sir Paul, who thought the new addition to the house-party a very charming  one.</p>
<p>The  theatricals were to take place on Christmas-eve, to which it still wanted a  week; but then every moment till then would be taken up in rehearsals,  discussions, trying on dresses, and a dozen other delightful modes of passing  time; and Nora, who had never of course been in such a whirl before, was in  ecstasies, as she confided to Sir Paul before dinner was half over. It never  would have occurred to Nora to fall in love with Sir Paul, but he seemed such a  nice, fatherly man, she felt she could tell him everything, and she chatted  away about all her hopes and fears in the most natural manner! He had declined  to take a part in the theatricals, but had promised to prompt and stage-manage,  and make himself generally useful. Of course he would look especially after  Nora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  then, you know, I shall feel quite safe; for it does make one very shy acting  for the first time, does it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sure you will prove the most charming <em>soubrette</em> imaginable. Miss Chevenix is to play.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Nora, a sort of cold feeling coming over her when she thought of Miss  Chevenix.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  Babley. He is an accomplished actor; quite an old stager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am so glad; then he will teach me. I am so horribly ignorant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted,  I should imagine:&rdquo; which was more than Sir Paul looked as he uttered the word.</p>
<p>He  was right, however, Babley was delighted; his eyes told it all too plainly,  even if his ready tongue had not expressed it, when Nora asked him rather  timorously in the drawing-room after dinner, if he would kindly teach her how  to act her part. What more legitimate flirting-ground than coaching a pretty  girl in amateur theatricals?</p>
<p>So  the week ebbed away, ebbed all too rapidly for Nora, who was perfectly,  entrancingly happy. Never before in her life had she even dreamed that such  utter happiness could be. Never, probably, again in her life would she taste  it. This first experience of young love was far too intoxicating to last. Yet  Nora imagined it would go on forever. No more monotonous, dull weeks in the  moldy north-country town. The whole future would be bright, like that genial,  enjoyable Devonshire Christmas. Babley was her slave, and so thoroughly did she  feel protected by his attentions that in less than two days she ceased to care  about Miss Chevenix&rsquo;s barbed arrows, sharp though their points undeniably were.</p>
<p>Lady  Belletowers noted the flirtation: how could she help it? but she said nothing.  She had no fault to find with her young charge, whose behavior was perfectly  dignified and maidenly; and if it came to nothing, which, perhaps, from having  seen Mr. Babley pass through the throes more than once, she rather expected,  yet Lady Belletowers was one of those women of the world who believe that a real  honest flirtation is not altogether disadvantageous to a girl&rsquo;s prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time <em>does</em> pass quickly when one is happy,&rdquo;  thought Nora; for Christmas-eve came much too soon, though she had been looking  forward to it for weeks. Anticipation in her case, however, did not prove the  keener part of pleasure; for was she not in the very seventh heaven? The  flowers, the lights, the stage, the music, the lovely bracelet Lord Belletowers  had given her for a Christmas-box, the quiet attention of Sir Paul, the adulation  of those in the house-party who preferred Miss Boynton to Miss Chevenix (and  they were many), above all the tremendous outpouring of Babley worship&mdash;if all  this was not enough to turn little Nora&rsquo;s head, unaccustomed as it was to a  whirl, it must indeed have been strong.</p>
<p>The  acting was a perfect success. Are not all amateur theatricals undeniable  successes? Although Miss Chevenix played the leading part, and received the  wreath of laurel, Babley himself presenting it on his bended knee, yet Nora was  quite satisfied with herself and with Babley&rsquo;s stray glances when no one was  looking. She was not in the least jealous of Miss Chevenix, and went to bed  early on Christmas morning perfectly happy, one only regret marring her bliss,  that &ldquo;those beautiful theatricals were over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  came down to breakfast on the day of the great festival looking very bright,  and when the whole party started for the village church, Nora&rsquo;s sonsie face,  under her little seal-skin hat, was generally voted the fairest there. She  walked to church with Sir Paul, and gushed to him of the happiness she had  derived from her visit to Belletowers, he listening to every word she uttered  with a half-amused, half-sorrowful expression, for which Nora, as she thought  of it by and by, when she ought to have been listening to the sermon, could not  wholly account.</p>
<p>She  walked back from church with Mr. Babley. For a minute or two they talked of  their histrionic triumphs on the previous evening; then they lapsed into a  tenderer strain; that is, Mr. Babley told her how pretty she had looked last  night in her little short <em>soubrette&rsquo;s</em> dress, but that she looked prettier far this morning, with the bright winter  sun falling on her face. There were so few faces, he said, that could meet the  glare of daylight and defy it.</p>
<p>And  then he told her that he loved her&mdash;with his eyes. They were dark-blue, speaking  eyes, and they frequently served him instead of speech, thus preventing him  from getting into the difficulties words sometimes entail. It was very pleasant  to be complimented by Mr. Babley, and to have his great expressive eyes staring  into your very soul. At least so Nora thought; but she began, nevertheless,  just to wonder whether he never meant to go any further. Time was slipping  away, and visions of that third-class railway carriage, and the wretched,  half-furnished, half-fed northern home would obtrude themselves. She had only  been invited for a fortnight; Lady Belletowers never gave long invitations; and  half of that halcyon time was gone.</p>
<p>Nora  was ruminating in some such strain, when Mr. Babley said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  frost looks as if it were going to yield. Thank goodness, we shall get some  hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you hunt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should think so&mdash;rather. It is the only thing in the world worth living for. All  the summer through I dream of hunting, and then when winter arrives there&rsquo;s a  horrid frost, and one is obliged to amuse one&rsquo;s self with theatricals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr. Babley, I thought you liked theatricals!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course I do, but I like hunting better. And so would you, had you ever tried  it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  included her, believing she would participate in his love of sport; but,  nevertheless, the statement that he loved hunting better than anything jarred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  shall you never give up hunting?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;never give up hunting? Is it the  only thing worth living for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  till I am too old for life to be worth living,&rdquo; he answered, with a laugh. &ldquo;You  should see Barley-sugar and Rosie, my two pet hunters. They are beauties, and  no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  gave a little &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; She was more jealous of the hunters than of any attentions  she had ever seen Mr. Babley pay to any human divinities.</p>
<p>Christmas-eve  she had been at the very flood-tide of happiness. Christmas-day the ebb seemed  to have set in. It was not that Babley was less assiduous in his attentions,  but Nora was growing tired of attentions which never got any further, and of  which she found Barley-sugar and Rosie had by far the greater share; for the  frost of the last ten days was succeeded by a rapid thaw, so that little was  seen of the heroes of the party, at least during the day. Nora was already  beginning to discover that Belletowers was not the Utopia she had believed it  to be, and that even in palaces, with riches to command, there were many dull  hours to be passed.</p>
<p>New-year&rsquo;s  night there was to be a ball. She had nearly danced her cheap shoes into holes  with the amount of dancing that had already been perpetrated; and as for her  new dresses, they sadly wanted a maid to furbish them up; but she devoted some  of her time to darning and renovating, and looked forward to the New Year being  inaugurated by another triumph. On the morrow the party was to disperse; and  Nora felt that if Mr. Babley did not come forward to-night she would have to go  back to her north-country home more utterly unfit to struggle with its  vicissitudes than ever she had been in her life before.</p>
<p>She  came out of her room looking lovely. Her deft fingers had done wonders for the  draggled <em>tulle</em>, and meeting the plain  heiress on the stairs, she hooked her arm in hers, and they went down into the  ball-room together. Sir Paul asked her for the first dance; Mr. Babley carried  off the heiress. This was not at all what Nora had intended, but she had no  doubt things would improve as the evening warmed, and she set herself to talk  amiably to Sir Paul, who asked her if she was sorry or glad to be going home so  soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,  very sorry,&rdquo; she answered, the tears brimming into her eyes; &ldquo;I have enjoyed  myself so much, and my home&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  stopped and colored up. She had become so used to make a confidant of Sir Paul  that she was on the verge of saying too much. He knew all about it, however. He  was the intimate friend of the house. Lady Belletowers had but few secrets from  Sir Paul. In fact, although he did not tell Nora this, he had danced with her  mother when she was accounted the belle of the county. He did not appear to  have noticed Nora&rsquo;s little mistake, but said kindly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps  Lady Belletowers will ask you to stay on after the rest of the party has gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  no, I am sure she will not; she was talking about my going home only yesterday.  Besides, papa says Lady Belletowers soon gets tired of people. She might get  tired of me if I were here all alone. It would not be very lively, would it.  Sir Paul smiled; but Nora was looking across the room at Mr. Babley, who at  that moment was bringing the full artillery of his eyes to bear on the heiress.  Enthusiast that he was about feminine beauty, he did not fail to admire it in  the coin of the realm.</p>
<p>Nora&rsquo;s  dance with Sir Paul being over, several young men came up to ask her to let  them put her name on their cards; but not Mr. Babley. He did not put in a claim  till very late, by which time Nora was almost in tears. Could it be possible  that he was only flirting, while she&mdash; The idea was almost too dreadful to be  thought of; so she called up all her bravery and shook the horrid thought away,  especially when at last he asked her for a waltz. At all events she would enjoy  herself now. Babley was to leave Belletowers on the morrow; she herself on the  following day. Once more dancing with Nora, the future Lord de Porchington  seemed to forget the heiress, the hunters, everything but Nora, and till far on  in the small hours, when the band played &ldquo;God Save the Queen,&rdquo; they lingered in  each other&rsquo;s society, made love, or flirted&mdash;and were happy; Sir Paul meanwhile  watching these unavowed lovers with more or less of a cynical smile lurking  about his well-cut mouth.</p>
<p>The  good-nights, or rather good-mornings, were said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am starting very early,&rdquo; whispered Babley; &ldquo;the meet is fifteen miles off. My  servant takes my things on to Lord Meresals&rsquo;s, where I dine. God bless you,  Miss Boynton. We shall meet again soon, I hope. At all events, I shall look  forward to finding you here next winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An  ardent look from those wonderful eyes. Nora is swept on by the crowd of ladies  hurrying up to bed, and the parting with Babley, so unexpected and so cold, is  over. It is nearly six when the disappointed girl is at last alone in her room,  but she does not feel in the least inclined to sleep. She pulls up the blind,  and looks for a gleam of color in the sky; but there is not even one break, so  she sits down in the arm-chair by the fire&mdash; not caring now whether her  ball-dress is tumbled or fresh&mdash;and begins to think, till from thinking she gets  to crying, and the large tear-drops fall all about the gauzy attire, bedewing  it with a portion of the sadness of which poor Nora&rsquo;s heart is so full.</p>
<p>It  is not that she is so desperately in love with Babley that she feels she can  never be happy without him. It is over her own blighted prospects she is  lamenting. That Christmas to which she had looked forward as to the  turning-point of life! It was all over. The day after to-morrow she must go  back to the North, and probably sooner or later she would have to go out as a  governess&mdash;her mother had said so; that this was her only chance. Oh, how she  had awaited it!</p>
<p>And  sobs succeeded sobs till Nora looked very pink about the eyes and very pale  about the cheeks, and moreover began to shiver and get very cold. So at last  she undressed and went to bed, just as the winter&rsquo;s sun peeped in through the  frosted panes. Nora looked at it, and blessed the frost, and wondered if Mr.  Babley would really go. After a while she fell asleep, and did not wake till  eleven o&rsquo;clock, when the maid came in to tell her breakfast would be at twelve.</p>
<p>Nora  got up wearily and dressed herself very slowly. Her tumbled finery was lying  all about the room in hopeless confusion, but she did not attempt to put things  straight. She kicked the ill-fated ball-dress, which had cost her so many hours  of thought in its arrangement, into a heap in a corner, and went down to  breakfast, looking so solemn that Miss Chevenix exclaimed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  late hours don&rsquo;t suit you, Miss Boynton. You do look pinched and ill this  morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Nora did not care what she said; she would soon be beyond the reach of her  darts now. She looked round the table. Babley was not there. Of course those  odious hunters had won him, so that was over.</p>
<p>Everybody  was taking of departure; Bradshaw, junctions, luggage were the key-words, till  Nora was heartily sick of them. The only complacent-looking individual was Sir  Paul. He seemed to be eating his breakfast with so much silent dignity and  composure that in the unreasonable state of her mind he irritated her by his <em>sang-froid</em> as much as the other people  did by their fussiness. To Nora this breakfast was the very longest meal she  had ever experienced at Belletowers; and she was truly thankful when it was  over and she was at liberty to return once more to the solitude of her own  room.</p>
<p>Oh,  that dreadful packing up! How joyfully she had gathered her war accouterments  together at the beginning of the campaign! but, like a defeated, heart-broken  soldier, she cared but little what became of them now. Marius weeping over the  ruins of Carthage could scarcely have looked more disconsolate than poor Nora  sitting among her open boxes and the ruins of her once glorious panoply.</p>
<p>For  an hour at least she had sat there, and no one came to help her. The maids had long  since discovered that Miss Boynton was a poor relation, and neglected her  accordingly.</p>
<p>A  knock, however, was heard at the door. Could some one really be coming to pack  those masses of things?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  Miss Boynton, will you go to her ladyship in the boudoir? Her ladyship wishes  to speak to you, and says never mind the packing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  sprung to her feet, and a sudden rush of feeling brought the blood back to her  heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will come directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babley&rdquo;  was the one word that rose to her lips as she paused for a moment before the  looking-glass to twist a rebellious curl into its place, and give her  immaculate linen collar just the least pretense at arrangement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  and sit down by me here on the sofa, my love,&rdquo; said Lady Belletowers very  kindly and gently (she was a woman with gentle manners, but a determined will),  when Nora, a second or two later, entered the room. &ldquo;I have a matter of a very  delicate and responsible nature to talk about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  kissed the girl, who was trembling all over, and then went on;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  the absence of your own mother, especially as she has confided you to me, I  feel, my dear child, that you will let me stand in her place. I will strive to  fill it honestly, and I hope discreetly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Lady Belletowers, you are more than kind;&rdquo; and Nora sought to hide her burning  cheeks half in the sofa cushion and half in the folds of Lady Belletower&rsquo;s  dress.</p>
<p>Her  ladyship stroked her hair affectionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  fact is, my dear little Nora, I have been selected as an embassadress to  propose to you a great alliance,&rdquo; she said, assuming a playful manner when she  saw the girl was really frightened. At this juncture Nora&rsquo;s face was entirely  concealed, only the tips of her very pink ears testified to the exceeding  confusion from which she was suffering. Lady Belletowers, however, gently  removed her hands from her burning cheeks, and went on: &ldquo;You are a very lucky  girl, my love, since you have won the devotion, not only of a very rich man,  holding a high position in the world, but of a kind and noble heart. There is  scarcely a girl in our society but would feel flattered at being asked to  become the wife of Sir Paul Statfield.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir  Paul Statfield!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  all the color forsook Nora&rsquo;s face, leaving it white and ashen in hue. This  testimony of her feelings was only what Lady Belletowers had expected. She did  not pretend to notice it, however, but said with a smile,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  may, indeed, be surprised to think that our poor little north-country Nora  should be going to make this great match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I cannot&mdash;I cannot. Oh, dear Lady Belletowers, I cannot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cannot!  I do not understand. Explain, child. What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know; I am so startled&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  do not excite yourself, my sweet girl. Compose your nerves, and let us discuss  the subject practically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  dear Lady Belletowers, if I do not love Sir Paul&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Nora, don&rsquo;t begin to talk such nonsense; it is too childish. Sir Paul  loves you; he is a man of wealth and position; a courteous, kind-hearted  gentleman; while you&mdash;do not think me unkind for speaking plainly&mdash;you have no  future, and a very indifferently comfortable home. You cannot afford to be  sentimental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  sat with clasped hands, looking fixedly at the carpet, but did not speak. &ldquo;If  it had only been Babley!&rdquo; she thought.</p>
<p>Lady  Belletowers continued, like a dexterous surgeon holding the knife with which  she meant to cut mischief out at the very root with a firm hand,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir  Paul is going to stay on here for a few weeks while some repairs at Statfield  Park are being done. I had hoped, my child, that you, too, would have remained  with us for a time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  color rose in Nora&rsquo;s face. Remain at Belletowers; not to have to go back to her  miserable home! Oh, it would be too delightful! But her joy fell once more to  zero when Lady Belletowers said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course, if you absolutely refuse Sir Paul this will be impossible, as daily  meeting a girl who has rejected him would be a painful ordeal, through which I  could not condemn him to pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor  Nora! what conflicting emotions were hers! How heavily she felt the weight of  poverty. The idea of the return home weighed upon her as a sort of nightmare.  Could she ever bear the taunts of her relations, especially if they learned  that she had received a proposal from Sir Paul Statfield. Should she marry him?  How could she, when she did not love him? What was she to do? She begged for a  reprieve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not tell him I will never marry him,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;but ask him to have a little  patience. Tell him I am so surprised&mdash;so&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  sentence finished in a sob on Lady Belletowers&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>Lady  Belletowers kissed and caressed her, begged her not to cry, told her she was a  brave little heart; and now, for the first time&mdash;wary <em>diplomate</em> that she was&mdash;alluded to the love-making with Mr. Babley.  She assured Nora that he was a heartless flirt, that he had never meant  anything beyond the amusement of the passing hour. &ldquo;In proof of which, my  dear,&rdquo; she concluded, &ldquo;he proposed and was accepted by Miss Despreaux last  night. She told me so herself this morning. She has a hundred thousand pounds,  you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  lifted her head from her cousin&rsquo;s shoulder, and dried her tears forthwith; but  her face was deadly pale. This fresh shock to her nerves was a sudden and  startling one. Through how many emotions was she to pass this Christmas-tide,  she wondered!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will leave you, my love, to recover yourself, while I go and speak to Sir Paul.  Here is some eau-de-cologne; bathe your face with it, and stay here for a  little while, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  promised, and was soon left to her meditations, which were scarcely more lively  than when she had sat among her open boxes, envying the very servants, because  they had not to leave Belletowers.</p>
<p>It  was Babley, not Belletowers, that had made her last week&rsquo;s sojourn there a  Paradise. She knew it full well now; in fact, she thought so much of Babley and  his defection, that she forgot all about Sir Paul. How could she be expected to  think of him, with her first love-dream lying shattered into a thousand atoms  at her feet?</p>
<p>While  she still lingers there, looking with sorrowful longing at the broken  fragments, the door opens quietly, and before she has time to utter even one  little cry, Sir Paul is standing before her. Had it been possible she would  have taken instant flight; but before she could make up her mind to do anything  Sir Paul is actually sitting beside her in the very place Lady Belletowers  quitted not half an hour before. He is looking at her very kindly with his  benevolent eyes; but Nora, even in her fright and perplexity, thinks his hair  looks more than usually gray, and wishes with all her heart that he were her  father or her uncle, and then he would never have asked her to marry him. Not a  very promising beginning to his suit, but then, fortunately, he could not read  her thoughts. </p>
<p>He  took her hand and held it in his own. She did not attempt to draw it away.  Since flight was impossible, she resolved to resign herself to circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Miss Boynton,&rdquo; he said, speaking in very low but very distinct tones,  &ldquo;Lady Belletowers tells me that you have kindly consented to stay on for a  little while at Belletowers, in order that we may become better acquainted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never promised anything; indeed I did not. I hope she has not misled you;&rdquo; and  Nora spoke very jerkily, half crying the while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you know, little one,&rdquo; he said, still holding her hand and patting it, &ldquo;if you  had accepted me at once, without any consideration, I should not love you half  so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo; asked Nora, opening her eyes very wide as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  I cannot expect a sweet little beauty like you to care for an old fellow such  as I am now, unless it is because you know that you are all he has in the world  to love, and that he means to devote his life to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  husbands always do that?&rdquo; asked Nora, ingenuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly  not, unless they marry for love; and I love you, sweet Nora, with all my heart.  I may call you Nora, may I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  if you like. I never was called anything else till I came to Belletowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  permission was not very encouraging, but Sir Paul only smiled. He evidently  either had an immense belief in his own power of making himself beloved, or  conjectured that the assumption of it would have the effect of carrying the  citadel he was besieging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well  then, Nora,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;you will answer me one very little question, will you  not? You will tell me that you do not hate me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate  you! no. Why should I hate you, Sir Paul? You have always been very kind to  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  long as you do not hate me, I am willing to say no more on the subject for the  present; for I see it is one that alarms you, if it is not altogether hateful  to you, sweet Nora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  night, only a <em>parti carre</em> sat down to  dinner at Lord Belletowers, and one of the guests was very silent, leaving all  the conversation to her host and hostess and Sir Paul.</p>
<p>In  the course of the evening Lady Belletowers asked Nora to sing. It was not  perhaps very kind of her under the circumstances; but Lady Belletowers had but  little patience with what she considered mere girlish whims. Nora had a sweet,  fresh, though uncultivated voice. However, it would have pleased her listeners,  who were not hypercritical, if she could only have succeeded in getting to the  end of her song; but something in the words&mdash;of course it was a  love-ditty&mdash;reminded her of what she was pleased to magnify into Babley&rsquo;s cool  desertion of her; a great gulp came in her throat; instead of a note a sob was  heard, and to Lady Belletowers&rsquo;s horror, for she hated a scene, this was  followed by an hysterical outburst, and Nora was sent off to bed in a sort of  silent disgrace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  shall go back to her family to-morrow,&rdquo; said Lady Belletowers, as the door  closed on her; &ldquo;this is too absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  Sir Paul pleaded: &ldquo;A week; just one week. If at the end of a week she still  says nay, then, Lady Belletowers, I will interfere no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady  Belletowers consented somewhat unwillingly, feeling rather provoked with a man  who could care to marry a girl showing so little regard for him and so little  spirit as Nora did.</p>
<p>She  failed entirely to see that it was the very ingenuousness and utter want of  worldly knowledge about Nora that, in Sir Paul&rsquo;s eyes, constituted her charm.</p>
<p>For  two days nothing of seeming importance occurred, but Nora was anything but  happy. Lady Belletowers took every possible opportunity of letting her see she  was angry with her, even to looking upon her refusal of Sir Paul as a personal  injury. As for Sir Paul himself, he but rarely spoke to her, and poor Nora  almost wished herself back in the third-class carriage, journeying to her  northern home. She was fully aware that she would be received there with gibes  and taunts: but still it was her home, and she had as much right to be there as  her overbearing, disagreeable sisters.</p>
<p>She  was lying in bed one morning brooding upon her unhappy lot; when the maid  brought her a letter in her mother&rsquo;s handwriting.</p>
<p>Nora  trembled as she opened it. She knew so well what it would contain. Mrs. Boynton  never wrote letters except thoroughly to the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hear from Lady Belletowers,&rdquo; the letter said, &ldquo;that you are throwing away the  opportunity of a splendid match. I insist upon your marrying Sir Paul  Statfield. If you come back here except as his affianced wife you will not find  your life so comfortable as it has hitherto been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Comfortable!&rdquo;  murmured Nora. &ldquo;If it is to be less comfortable now, what will it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  mother went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know full well how straitened are our means. I shall discharge our only  servant, and shall expect you to wait on me and your sisters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  fell back on her pillow after reading these lines,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Babley, Babley!&rdquo; she cried, as the tears coursed each other down her cheeks.</p>
<p>At  last, however, she composed herself, and got up and dressed.</p>
<p>It  was very luxurious and pleasant in the sunny little bedroom at Belletowers, and  her gracious surroundings seemed to shed a cheering influence over her while  she dawdled there.</p>
<p>Since  she had had this peep into a fair, beautiful world it would be very hard to go  back and play Cinderella, she thought.</p>
<p>After  she had twisted up her pretty hair, she pulled up the blind and looked out on  the park, where the sun was shining brightly on the hoar-frosted grass. She  watched the scene for a while as she compared it to that dull, close town where  she had passed so many miserable days.</p>
<p>While  she was thinking how horrible it would be to go back there, some one came  slowly through a tiny copse at the bottom of the lawn. It was Sir Paul.</p>
<p>He  was old, certainly, Nora thought, as she watched him; but he had a pleasant  face, and his slight, straight figure looked very young in his suit of  dark-blue serge: besides, he would not make a Cinderella of her. He was not  Babley, certainly; but then, Babley! Oh dear, oh dear! life was horribly hard  and crooked. Notwithstanding her misery, Nora took a piece of red geranium out  of a bouquet of hot-house flowers in a vase on the dressing-table and pinned it  coquettishly in her dark-blue frock; then she looked at herself two or three  times in the glass, twisting her brown hair into fascinating little curls; and  finally she went down into the hall, meeting Sir Paul at the bottom of the  stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,  Sir Paul,&rdquo; she said, very cordially. &ldquo;I hope you have enjoyed your walk. I saw  you from my window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is delightful out-of-doors to-day. Will you come for a stroll? Lady Belletowers  is on the terrace talking to the gardener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nora  consented, and was speedily wrapped in a large ulster which Sir Paul took down  from a peg close by, the hood being thrown over her head instead of a hat.</p>
<p>She  looked very bewitching as she stood there laughing; and so Sir Paul thought. He  was delighted, too, to see her laugh, for she had been nearer crying than  laughing for the last few days.</p>
<p>She  was going to marry Sir Paul. She had made up her mind. That word Cinderella had  decided it. So it was no use to cry any more, she supposed.</p>
<p>A  moment later, and they are strolling beside the frozen lake, on which the  defrauded ducks waddle awkwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he says, after a silence, and stooping down to her with a kindly, unembarrassed  smile, &ldquo;it is late days with me for pretty speeches, but I can&rsquo;t help comparing  you at this moment to some lovely flowery landscape, over which heavy  snow-clouds are suddenly gathered; I, with my gray hair, representing the  snow-cloud, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t seem at all wintry to me,&rdquo; she said, encouragingly; for she had made up  her mind that since she was to give herself to this man she would not spoil the  gift by want of graciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  feel young at heart, at any rate,&rdquo; he said, gratefully. &ldquo;Young at heart when I  gaze on you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  now she looked down and blushed, and really did for the moment forget his years  in the courteous charm of his words and manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  say, then,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;have you decided? Will you consent to be an old man&rsquo;s  darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she said, roguishly; &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo; Then, after a little pause, in which she  reveled, I am afraid, in the anxiety she was causing, she added, with a glad,  sunny laugh, &ldquo;I cannot; you are not old enough. But I will be your true and  loving wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  held up her face to him, and he stooped and kissed those tempting ripe, red  lips; nor could he refrain from thinking as he did so, &ldquo;How they err who  declare that rapture dies with youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  when they returned to the house, after wandering together for a while, Lord and  Lady Belletowers kissed Nora, and called her a dear little girl.</p>
<p>In  fact, every one seemed so pleased that Nora began to think she was pleased  herself. At all events, she was grateful that she should not have to go back to  her miserable home and play Cinderella after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="MrsBartersBequest"></a>Mrs.  Barter&rsquo;s Bequest</strong></h1>
<p>Rumors  having come to my ears of some unprecedented troubles that had afflicted the  placid-looking little old woman who had been living with her niece for several  years in our small Somerset village, and actuated by curiosity to hear her  experiences, I called one evening at her tidy cottage armed with an infallible  introduction to her confidence in the shape of a pound of tea of unimpeachable  character, during the discussion of the infusion of a portion of which I with  slight difficulty drew from her the following narrative:</p>
<p>I  did not wish to tell about it again to anybody, she commenced, for it has cost  me many years of trouble and anxiety, such as I hope may never fall to the lot  of any one person again. My poor dear sister married the captain of a merchant  vessel which traded at that time&mdash;(she hesitated here, and her niece Barbara,  seeing the old lady&rsquo;s forgetfulness, on this least eventful portion of her  story, added)&mdash;from St. Katharine&rsquo;s Docks to Singapore.</p>
<p>Ah!  well I remember the comforters which I made for her, the mittens and muff of  our dear mother which I presented to her toward her outfit; for she would  accompany her husband, although she knew that she would be the only woman on  board, and, apart from her husband, there were eight of the very  roughest-looking crew you could imagine.</p>
<p>It  was my sister&rsquo;s first voyage, and in opposition to the wish of both her husband  and myself. But poor Betty was superstitious: she would recollect any dreams  that she had: and then refer to her Book of Fate to learn their interpretation.  I will not say one way or the other as to my faith. (Which I thought rather an  evasive reply to my question as to the extent of her credulity in the matter  which elicited her remark.)</p>
<p>Betty&rsquo;s  resolve to go the voyage was suddenly taken, and in this manner: I had engaged  some nice and cheerful rooms in a lovely part of Horselydown, where we intended  to live together until the captain returned from his voyage, and into which I  had moved my little furniture. One night, after we had settled down  comfortably, we sat round the supper-table&mdash;Captain Barter, Betty, the mate, and  I, all as cheerful as possible. What with the songs of Betty, the captain, and  mate, riddles and fortune-telling (only by way of joke, ma&rsquo;am), the evening was  quickly spent. The mate left, and as the vessel was to leave the Docks on the  morrow, and Barter had to be up early to take final instructions from the  owners, we retired to bed immediately.</p>
<p>There  have been times when, I dare say, you have felt (without exactly knowing the  cause) that there is some trouble about to happen; you have a sensation of a  great weight upon your spirits, and the more you try to reason it away from  you, the more despondent you become. Such was my case as I lay restless upon my  bed until daylight. I used all my endeavors to arouse in me cheerful feelings.  I tried to think what a fine thing it would be when the time should come for  the return of Betty&rsquo;s husband, after a successful voyage, and of the happy  hours he would spend ashore with her. Perhaps, as I have known other merchant  captains do, he would bring home with him some pet things which he had  collected abroad for her&mdash;a parrot or a porcupine, maybe an opossum or kangaroo,  something that during his next trip she might cherish in her bosom, thinking of  the donor all the time until he came back to her again. I tried to think of  some inestimable pet that poor Betty might, perhaps, show to him, which would  make <em>him</em> look forward with a double  longing to his return from successive trips. I tried to divert myself with  reading, and taking up one of the &ldquo;Sisters&rsquo; tracts,&rdquo; a few of which I always  keep by my bedside in case of wakeful nights, I had read as far in the &ldquo;Converted  Cowboy&rdquo; as that part where, in his unregenerate days, he set his dog at a  district visitor, when I saw my door open slowly and admit Betty, looking as  white as a sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  Susan,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have had an awful dream&mdash;that David&rdquo; (that was Barter&rsquo;s  Christian name) &ldquo;had gone upon his voyage, which was a very short one, and he  returned quickly, looking hale and hearty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  then opened her little book, and showed that the dream portended a long voyage  and doubtful return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  words did he say in the dream?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can only remember.&rdquo; said Betty, &ldquo;that he intimated his next voyage would be a  shorter one still, and he would take it by himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  fresh reference to the little book gave a terrible interpretation; she knew  then that his present voyage would be a very protracted one, and that she must  not look for his return.</p>
<p>I  saw the poor thing was so overcome with her feelings that I threw on a few  clothes, and running down-stairs, brought up some of the Hollands which had  been left from our supper, and mixed her a glassful.</p>
<p>I  will not weary you with the serious chat which we had together, and which ended  in my agreeing with her that she should go out in the vessel with Barter.</p>
<p>The  captain, who had been away upon business since five o&rsquo;clock, came in to  breakfast about three hours afterward, and then Betty spoke out her resolve. He  tried to reason with her, but, seeing how much she took it to heart, how pale  and distressed she appeared, he gave way and determined to take her with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will have to rough it, Betty,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for our cargo is a miscellaneous one&mdash;woolen  goods, iron, copper, and tin, and a deck loading of hardware that will leave  very little gangway; and the Dart ain&rsquo;t quite what she used to be; but it&rsquo;ll be  my last trip in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was an unlucky speech, for Betty, full of the memory of her dream, looked paler  than before, seeing which, Barter added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  mean that after this trip she&rsquo;ll be put on for Hamburg, Rotterdam, and such  short voyages. However, I&rsquo;ll do the best to make you comfortable aboard, little  woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To  witness the happiness of Betty as we set to work collecting things for the  passage was a treat, and then came a slight reprieve, as she could join the  ship at Gravesend at noon, which was fortunate, as Barter, on looking over her  luggage, ordered in a manner which I thought peremptory that a beautiful lot of  bedding, father&rsquo;s easy-chair, a parrot in a cage, a washing-machine, and an  ironing-board, all to be unpacked and left behind.</p>
<p>The  next day I went with Betty to Gravesend, and left her on board looking well and  happy. The tug weighed anchor and moved off, leaving me to my loneliness.</p>
<p>I  felt far more lonely when I returned home, notwithstanding that my friends,  knowing how events had turned out, took it in turn to come and sit with me; and  among them our minister was unremitting in his calls, generally accompanied  with the &ldquo;Sisters&rsquo; Collecting Box,&rdquo; for he said, when a sister is in affliction  she can the more easily sympathize with others in distress.</p>
<p>News  came at last, after many weary months of waiting, and sad intelligence it was.  (Barbara, who doubtless had heard the narrative many times before, dived into  the recesses of an old bureau and produced a discolored and frayed letter,  which she read as follows):</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Singapore,&mdash;,  18&mdash;.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DEAR  SISTER,&mdash;After a much-delayed voyage, owing partly to contrary winds, and  partly, I fear, to the overloading of the brig, we reached Singapore. I was  very ill for several days after leaving England, recovery being delayed by the  unhealthy atmosphere created by the bilge-water, the pumps being out of order.  I am still far from well, the climate being so different to what I have been  used to; but if I can only escape the fever which is so very prevalent here  just now, I shall get on very well. I am too weak to give you an account of the  place, but must reserve that until we meet. Barter has just come on shore, for  the unloading is now completed, and he is busy with the consignees arranging  for a return cargo, He has been complaining of dizziness in his head, so I  shall keep him in-doors all day tomorrow, for on Saturdays hardly any business  is done here save what is connected with dispatch of mails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was then dying, ma&rsquo;am, of the fever, as you can see from the handwriting; for  what follows is hardly legible, and is penned in a weak and straggling manner.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;With  kisses to you, my dear sister.&rdquo; And on the other page, after a blank space: &ldquo;I  am receiving great attention from an Englishwoman, whose husband, a packer at a  merchant&rsquo;s, has just died. She is staying at our lodgings with her infant, born  here, she is far from well. The German doctor who visits me says she must go to  the English hospital. Again, good-bye until I see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor  Betty! she did write again, but the letter did not come by mail.</p>
<p>Several  months after receipt of her first communication I was sitting in my little  parlor, which I had kept so nice and tidy to welcome the absent ones on their  return, having just tied my bonnet-strings ready to start for chapel&mdash;for it was  a Wednesday evening&mdash;when there came a loud series of raps at the street door,  and on my opening it I saw a rough-looking individual in a pea-coat, who,  asking my name and being satisfied as to my identity, said: &ldquo;I have a letter  for you, ma&rsquo;am, and a&mdash;baby.&rdquo; I could not speak for my agitation, but, taking  him by the sleeve, led him into the room, when he handed me the letter, and  producing from the shelter of his coat a little morsel of a child, laid it  carefully on the sofa. He then passed his hand thoughtfully once or twice over  his mouth, and put on such a parched look in general that I approached the  bell-handle with a view to ordering some refreshment. &ldquo;As you&rsquo;re so obligin&rsquo;,  ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, observing my intention, &ldquo;I takes rum, and likes the water  cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  ran down into the kitchen, sent the girl out for a bottle of the spirit which  he indicated, and then perused the letter.</p>
<p>(Barbara  was now prepared with the second epistle, which ran thus, in weak, disjointed  sentences:)</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;DEAR  SISTER,&mdash;Do not grieve for me; Barty died two days ago; the mate survived him  only a few hours, and four of the crew have likewise succumbed to the fever; my  nurse, who I mentioned in my last (Mrs. Prebble), was obliged to go into the  hospital, left her child with me, was delirious from the time she got there  until her death, which, I am told, happened a day or two after admission.  Little Jacob will be brought to you by one of our old crew. Pray take charge of  him. He has no one belonging to him now alive. I can write no more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was evidently some feeble attempt to write some more words, and some blots, as  if caused by the pen falling from her dying hold of it; and on the fourth page,  in a different handwriting, I read as follows:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Ze  woman is dead of yellow fever. I zee de Gonzul&mdash;she had no booberdies or monies.  She died 2 hours before ze brig sdarded, and ze babe is bermidded to be zent  on. I write dis as a gumford to you, zeeing ze ledder oben.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;HAHNDAK,  Doc.-Med.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  hardly know how I had courage to read to the end: and when I had concluded I  sat for some minutes in a state of stupor. I felt that her first letter was  meant to break her impending fate to me. The end had now come, and my future  life would be a long sorrow. However, for her sake I would cherish my little  ward, knowing that its infant companionship had afforded some brief pleasure to  poor Betty. After remaining down-stairs some little time longer in order to  compose myself, I re-entered the parlor, and was shocked at beholding the rough  fellow who had brought me the sad news sitting in the very chair which Betty  had always used, and the girl equally at her ease in my arm-chair, both having  evidently partaken freely of the bottle, while the child was lying across the  lap of the latter, struggling and choking from the fumes of the strong tobacco  from a pipe in which the sailor was indulging. To snatch the little thing out  of the hands of the servant and dismiss her upon the spot was the work of a few  seconds; to hand five shillings to the man and hold open the door for him to go  was the next step; but he apparently liked his quarters too well, for he  reseated himself after pocketing the silver, and poured out the remainder of  the rum (which fortunately was small), which he began deliberately to sip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought you&rsquo;d like to hear the end on her, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She died  beautiful. The old Dutchman who doctored her hardly left her when she got bad.  She&rsquo;d got no nurse, for none could be had but Chinese, and they&rsquo;re wuss than  nothing. I nussed her at last, for every one that could make a bolt of it had  fled from an infected house. I assure you, ma&rsquo;am, I never felt so near cryin&rsquo;  in my life as when she bade me take charge of this young &rsquo;un and bring him over  to you. He&rsquo;ll make a fine sailor when he grows up, for he took to the sea  wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  man had now finished the last drop of spirits, and getting up to go, said  reflectively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rum  and baccy are fine things to stave off yellow Jack. Your poor sister wouldn&rsquo;t  touch either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  then left, and I was alone with the child. Perfectly unused to the management  of children, I was compelled to overlook my girl&rsquo;s behavior in reference to the  spirit-bottle, and took her into my confidence, knowing that she had formerly  been a nursemaid in the service of a tradesman at Hackney; and she very  willingly, in consideration of a small addition to her wages, undertook the  management of the little orphan.</p>
<p>With  this additional strain upon my slender resources, I was before long compelled  to give up the apartments to which I was so much attached, and to search for  humbler rooms, which I found at last at Deptford: and cheerful enough in their  way; for the landlord&rsquo;s son kept chickens in the back-yard; a lad living with  his father (a foreman in the dock-yard) had rabbits on the landing, which,  after running up and down the stairs, afforded great delight to Jacob; while the  occupier of the top room, a tailor&rsquo;s trotter, possessed some wonderful pigeons,  which were the delight and admiration of the neighborhood. Besides all these,  every organ-man in the place paid our street a visit, while Punch and Judy,  acrobats and negro minstrels made an agreeable variety.</p>
<p>Time  passed on, and little Jacob began to fill out wonderfully; his little frocks  had perpetually to be let out and lengthened, and at the age of three he had  all the appearance of a child of seven. Little did I then think that the pride  with which I received the congratulations of my neighbors would, ere long, be  replaced by feelings of anguish.</p>
<p>But  with his growth the liveliness of the child completely faded away; amusements  suitable to his years failed to draw a smile from him. In fact, all he did was  to sit sulkily alone and &mdash;grow, and so marvelously that it soon became the talk  of the neighborhood. Indeed, it was hard work to keep out the people, who would  almost force their way into the little back parlor and stare at him as he sat  moodily in the corner, while, if he went to the front room, no sooner was his  presence detected than the street boys clustered around the window and grimaced  at him through the panes. Matters went on this way until he was twelve years old.  He then far overtopped me; his voice was that of a man; his feet and hands of  an enormous size; and yet he was growing taller week after week, as I could  observe by the way in which his lower garments gradually receded from his  ankles. Reasoning from the rate at which Jacob was lengthening, the height to  which he would attain, should he reach the years of discretion, showed so  appalling a result that I was quite overpowered by the calculation, and  endeavored not to speculate any further upon the question.</p>
<p>Two  years later the boy could nearly look over our parlor door when it was open,  and still he showed no signs of having reached his limit.</p>
<p>I  could now only take him out in the dusk of the evening, and even then we were  frequently accompanied on our return by a mob, which cheered and played  practical jokes on the way.</p>
<p>The  news of the monstrous growth had now spread beyond our locality. A  picture-paper gave a paragraph concerning the Giant Boy of Deptford, giving a  short history of poor Jacob&rsquo;s birth and parentage&mdash;all a pack of falsehoods,  accompanied by a hideous engraving of him, which was equally untrue. I was  pestered with offers from circus people and agents for shows, desirous of  exhibiting him, and from public-houses and tea-gardens, wanting him as an  attraction for customers.</p>
<p>In  short, the worry, annoyance. and anxiety which I had been subjected to ended in  a nervous illness, which caused me to take to my bed.</p>
<p>An  old friend of mine, Mrs. Parminter, came to me and nursed me through a long  illness of five months, many days of which in my delirium I was engaged in  pursuing the mental calculation as to the ultimate length to which the boy  would attain, and which Mrs. Parminter has since assured me I generally settled  at two miles and a half.</p>
<p>My  kind nurse hardly left me, save to attend to Jacob, and with great  consideration excluded him from the room, fearing the effect upon me of the  presence of the predisposing cause of my illness. I well remember upon one  occasion, between lights, seeing Joanna (that is, Mrs. P.) very busily employed  upon some work which she evidently wished to conceal from my observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am only altering some things for Jacob,&rdquo; she said, seeing me look inquiringly  at her. &ldquo;It is no use attempting to deceive you,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Jacob has  outgrown his last fit. I have added pieces above and pieces below, until he  looks a perfect object; so I thought with a little management, these which  belonged to poor Parminter (he was a sergeant in the Life Guards) will, I  fancy, do well for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold  them up,&rdquo; I said, faintly.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Parminter was a short woman; and as she got upon her chair and unrolled those  trousers, until the bottoms reached the floor, I nearly had a relapse. It was  clear that Jacob had gone on growing vigorously during my illness.</p>
<p>A  few days after this shock I was about to express my wish to see the lad,  thinking that I was sufficiently strong for the interview, when a thick burst  of smoke came in at the bedroom door, and Joanna instantly dashed down-stairs.  At least an hour elapsed before her return, and when she came back she sat down  upon the bed, looking pale and exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  must tell you the truth,&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;Jacob is not the boy he was when I  first came here; a perfect change has come over him. Shortly after you took to  your bed, he became a very imp of mischief. This is the fourth time he has  tried to set the house on fire. Your parlor curtains have been consumed long  ago; your sofa-cover has been converted into tinder; two table-covers have been  made a bonfire of; the mischievous boy has sawn off the legs of four of your  chairs; and he has amused himself with shying your clogs at the chimney  ornaments, regardless of the mirror behind them, of which the frame only  remains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  on, Mrs. Parminter,&rdquo; I moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  he has turned out as cruel as he is mischievous; he has killed upward of a  dozen of the second-floor pigeons; and only a day or two ago I discovered six  of the rabbits on the landing stifled in the kitchen oven, where he had  deposited them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go  on,&rdquo; I repeated, faintly; &ldquo;let me know all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many  a time,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;have I caught him dropping hot cinders upon the  passers-by and sprinkling their clothes in wet weather from the upper window  with flour from the dredger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  there anything else?&rdquo; I asked, like one in a dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was but yesterday,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;that he plastered the head of the  washerwoman&rsquo;s little girl with your pomatum, and then emptied the contents of  your red tooth-powder over it, sending her into a fit, from which she is still  very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Parminter,&rdquo; I then said, &ldquo;send for my minister. He has always been a kind  friend to me, and will advise me what I am to do with the boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  next day Mr. Margetts came, sat down by my bedside, and drew forth his  prayer-book. Indeed, it was with some difficulty that I prevented him reading  the prayers appointed for those who are in a dying condition, for he evidently  concluded that from his hasty summons I was in that state. I then made him  acquainted with the facts as regarded the boy. He condoled with me, then  reflected a few minutes, and said that he would interview the culprit, and as  he returned very shortly, rubbing the back of his head with his hand, and with  a look of pain on his face, I have every reason to believe that my clogs, or a polishing-brush,  or some other hard but handy missile, coming into collision with his skull, had  curtailed his lecture considerably. Alas! what a Job&rsquo;s comforter Mr. Margetts  proved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you ever go to the waxworks, sister?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you may remember a model of the Russian Giant Looseskin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  tremendous figure came at once to my remembrance, although it was very many  years since I had visited Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sister, Master Jacob bids fair to surpass him. If I remember rightly, he was  eight feet and a half high when he died, and it was thought he had not attained  his full extent. Your friend who summoned me hither, adverting to the wondrous  progress of the lad down-stairs, induced me to buy a little book giving a  description of the most wonderful giants of modern times, and the extraordinary  development of your adopted child conforms remarkably with that of several  herein mentioned. Tony Payne, for example, at the age of twelve, was close upon  six feet without his shoes. At twenty-one he reached seven feet and a half. He  was very powerful, taking up a butcher at Taunton, who insulted him, and  throwing him a distance of fifteen feet, thereby dislocating his neck. A  gigantic boy at Willingham, above six feet in his fifteenth year, attained  seven feet eight inches at the age of eighteen. At an early age his voice was  deep and strong, like that of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  this point Jacob shouted up from the bottom of the stairs some impertinent  remarks directed at the minister, whom he evidently regarded as his personal  enemy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Voice, you perceive,&rdquo; continued Mr. Margetts, &ldquo;corresponds completely with the  description of the Willingham youth who, I see further on in the book, could  throw a blacksmith&rsquo;s hammer, weighing twenty pounds, a distance of sixty yards.  Now, from personal experience, I can tell you that your adopted child has  considerable muscular power in the propulsion of weights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  could listen to no further extracts, and snatching the book from the minister,  hid it beneath the bolster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  all due respect,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are giving me no advice as to how I am to act,  with the dreadful prospect before me of going to the grave in the constant  companionship of a mischievous giant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  now began to talk more sensibly, and after much discussion it was agreed that  Jacob should be sent down to Kent to a retired spot, where Mr. Margetts had a  friend who took charge of refractory pupils, with a view to their being trained  into docile characters; and, moreover, he volunteered to take charge of him  down, which was effected mainly by the bribe of a peashooter of great power,  the only compromise which Jacob&rsquo;s mischievous spirit would accept in the place  of a catapult, an implement, the possession of which by the tailor&rsquo;s trotter,  had excited his envy from its more destructive powers.</p>
<p>I  did not see the lad until the morning of his departure, and, although prepared  for a great change in him, his growth during the interval of my illness quite  appalled me. He stooped, nearly doubling himself, to kiss me, and I watched him  going down the street, pea-shooter in full play, at the cost of a dozen squares  of glass and a street lamp, which I had to pay for the next day.</p>
<p>As  you may imagine, his schooling was a great strain upon my income, but I was  able to make both ends meet by Mrs. Parminter coming to stay with me, and so  sharing with me the expenses of my rooms.</p>
<p>I  think, ma&rsquo;am, it will save your time if my niece were to read the two letters  which I received from the Master (and which she accordingly did, as follows):</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;MADAM,&mdash;Thanking  you for the remittance, I have to inform you that a further sum is due, as per  inclosed bill, for lesson books of his own, and those of his fellow-pupils  which he has destroyed; and also an account from a tailor, for he has completely  outgrown the clothes in which he came down here six months since. Although Mr.  Margetts, for whom I have the greatest respect, informed me of the nature of  Master Jacob&rsquo;s disposition, I was not prepared for such an excessive exhibition  of mischievous propensities as to have caused a perfect sensation; and I was  equally unprepared for such an enormous rapidity of growth, combined with a  most preposterous appetite. As regards the former, I am daily expecting demands  for compensation for broken windows, slaughtered pets, and other damages, laid,  I fear too truly, to his account; and as to appetite, by sheer terrorism he  extorts the shares of his companions at meal times, with the result that my  boys, who were once noticed by the congregation at the church which they attend  for their plump and healthy condition, now cast a reflection on my care  respecting their board by their attenuated forms. I have promised, however, to  try for another half year what can be done with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  second letter, five months later, ran thus:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  write immediately to inform you that Master Jacob has run away, and, in spite  of inquiries set on foot by the rural police, we have found no clew to his  whereabouts. A circumstance which occurred some time since pointed our search  in a particular direction. It was the occasion of a fair in the neighborhood to  which the boy had been attracted, and where he was found, surrounded by an  admiring crowd who took him for a Giant Boy at the fair whom they had an  opportunity of seeing gratis. Ere we got to him he was led by a man within the  canvas walls of one of the shows, and this person swore that the lad had  engaged to go with him on his rounds. Of course, since his disappearance this  time, all the fairs in the county have been searched, but it is believed that  he has been rapidly transferred to some distant place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Margetts was indefatigable in his endeavors to trace poor Jacob, but in spite  of advertisements and police inquiries, he met with no success.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding  the worry and anxiety which I had endured, I now only thought of the little  Jacob, who, when in his infancy, I hoped would grow up to be a prop and a  comfort to me in my old age, and many a cry I have had over the little clothes  in which he was first introduced to me, and which I had preserved up to the  time of his disappearance.</p>
<p>Years  passed on without any sign of the lad. My health began to fail; a temporary  change of air was recommended to me, and Mrs. Parminter, who still remained  with me, took me to Croydon, where her sister lives, in order to spend a few  weeks.</p>
<p>It  happened to be at the fair-time, and my friends, in order to distract my  thoughts, tried to persuade me to accompany them to the field in which the  shows were arranged; but I had not the heart for it, and they left me to brood  over my past troubles, wondering about the fate of poor Jacob, whether, as is  the habit with those of overgrowth, he had got to be weak at the knees; and  again, in my old way, calculating to what length he had at this time attained.</p>
<p>I  had not much time allowed for my reflections, for very shortly Mrs. Parminter  rushed up to the door in her impetuous way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  on your things quickly,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  obeyed mechanically, and in a short time we were at the field, and before a large  canvas structure on a platform, before which a repulsive-looking individual was  directing the attention of a small crowd to a painting of a gigantic negro  youth depicted in the act of making a meal of a huge boa-constrictor.</p>
<p>I  knew then, at once, why I had been brought there, and whom I should presently  see.</p>
<p>We  paid our admission money, and entered. A suspense of a minute or two, and after  a short harangue from the showman, there stepped forth from an opening in the  canvas, at the back, a black man of tremendous height, holding a  hideous-looking snake in either hand.</p>
<p>My  eyes were riveted upon the figure&mdash;a sight painful in the extreme&mdash;tremendous in  length, lamentably lean, and meager as to limb, weak and trembling to such an  extent that the showman kept close to his side, as much to support him as to  exhibit the contrast between the figures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  giant Mulatto, of Madagascar,&rdquo; as he was called, had to make a short speech,  and ere a sentence was concluded, I knew at once that it was our long-lost one.</p>
<p>Unable  to restrain my feelings, I sobbed out, &ldquo;Jacob, Jacob, have you forgotten me?&rdquo;  The lad recognized me at once, and tottered forward, but before he made a  couple of paces, his strength failed, and he fell heavily forward.</p>
<p>By  the aid of the few remaining spectators&mdash;the majority had made a rapid exit from  the place, accelerated greatly by the escape of the snakes from the giant&rsquo;s  grasp, and which wriggled under the benches&mdash;the recumbent form was carried to  the back, we accompanying him.</p>
<p>Now  that we had found him, my perplexity was how to get him away, and then what to  do with him.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Parminter again showed herself a tower of strength.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  nerves are shook,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;go home quietly. Calm yourself, and leave what is  to be done to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  went home as she told me, leaving her at the side of Jacob washing the black  off his face, heedless of the savage growling of the showman at this unexpected  and damaging interruption to his business.</p>
<p>At  a little before twelve at night came a gentle ring at the front door; there was  no need to guess the cause, for a face looked down upon me through the fanlight  over the door&mdash;it was that of my giant ward, who had to bend almost double to  pass into the small passage.</p>
<p>Weak  and exhausted, he lay upon the sofa in the parlor, which we extended by the  addition of three or four chairs; we gave him supper, which he devoured  ravenously, and with the aid of blankets made him comfortable for the night.</p>
<p>We  then left him, and I learned from Mrs. Parminter the account of his long  disappearance, and how she managed to procure his release.</p>
<p>The  lad had been decoyed away in the first instance by the man with whom, when at  school, he had been seen in communication, and was transferred by night to a  caravan, which was proceeding to a distant county. A year or two wore off his  novelty, and for a consideration he was made over from one owner to another,  until he fell into the hands of the man with whom we discovered him.</p>
<p>Half-starved,  his health and spirits broken, he admitted him to be a used up giant, and, if  he only got back the ten pounds which he had disbursed for the attraction, he  was willing to give him up; and the long interval which elapsed before Mrs. Parminter&rsquo;s  return was necessitated by her rapid flight back to London, to draw out the sum  required from her small savings, and so obviate the delay and uncertainty of  recourse to law for a delivery up of the lad.</p>
<p>Now  that we had Jacob back, the question was what to do with him. A giant in  ill-health upon our hands would be a sad trial, and being weak at the knees and  generally in a rickety condition, great trouble seemed to loom in the future.</p>
<p>To  make matters worse, the news of the affair quickly spread, and our house had a  greater crowd around it daily than poor Jacob ever attracted at the fair.</p>
<p>Men,  women, and children stormed the place, and made a perfect wreck of the front  garden in their efforts to obtain a glimpse of the prodigy; and fearing that  the excitement would be redoubled on the discontinuance of the  counter-attractions of the fair, we resolved to smuggle our patient into our  lodgings in London, and there tend upon him in peace. Mrs. Parminter  accordingly arranged with the proprietor of a furniture van, who was going to  London, to take him in it, covered over with a tarpaulin. So the next day he  was safely installed in a spare room which I was enabled to obtain in the house  where we lodged. Days went on, but I could see little improvement, although the  doctor, for our comfort, said that Jacob would get well, and that all his old mischief  would return with his increasing strength, and Mr. Margetts declared that he  was still growing, and that he was good for three feet more in height. All this  renewed the anxiety and trouble which I had almost forgotten while ministering  to Jacob in his illness.</p>
<p>Every  person, it is said, has some skeleton in his cupboard; but to have a living and  mischievous giant in a two-pair back seemed to me a far worse evil.</p>
<p>I  was sitting one evening meditating upon the future, when a violent pull at the  street door bell scattered all my thoughts. I gave admission to the visitor&mdash;a  tall, gaunt, and bronzed-faced woman, who passed me in an impetuous manner, and  strode into my little room.</p>
<p>I  heard her ask in a hurried and almost fierce way for Mrs. Barter&rsquo;s sister, and  I had barely time to own my identity, when the stranger flew at me and embraced  me. &ldquo;Excuse a mother&rsquo;s feelings,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but give me my little Jacob&mdash;my  long-lost little angel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Parminter soothed her in her quiet way, and the woman shortly told her story;  how that she, who was the widow of a packer (by the name of Prebble) in the  service of a merchant at Singapore, first lost her husband in the terrible  epidemic of 18&mdash;, and then was herself attacked, leaving her infant in the  charge of Mrs. Barter; how, when upon her recovery after an illness of many  months&rsquo; duration, for a long period of which she had been delirious, she heard  that the person with whom her child was left had died; how she could obtain no  clew as to how the child had been disposed of; how passenger lists (irregularly  kept during the season of visitation) led to no result: how, left without  resources, she took service in a family recently arrived, and with whom she  continued for several years, until her employer, having made his fortune, returned  to England; how that from the many friends she had made out abroad, she looked  upon the place as her second home, and entered into another period of service,  until the climate began to tell upon her powers, and the undefinable feeling of  home-sickness taking possession of her, she resolved to go back to England; how  with her savings she left the place which had been her home for so many years;  how a conversation with the captain of the merchantman, touching upon the time  of the great pestilence, elicited the fact that he took charge of an infant  found in possession of the widow of his old master Captain Barter of the Dart,  and brought the child over to England; to whom it was consigned, and to whose  house she bent her steps as soon as she was able after the arrival of the  vessel in England.</p>
<p>It  was indeed Jacob&rsquo;s mother who had called upon me on that eventful evening; but  sympathizing as I did with her upon her reunion with her offspring, I dreaded  to acquaint her with the facts of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  has grown very tall,&rdquo; I said, striving to break the news gradually&mdash; &ldquo;very tall  indeed;&rdquo; and I was pained to see the look of pride with which the poor woman  received the news. &ldquo;Taller,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;than you could possibly have  anticipated,&rdquo; and here I broke down, leaving her in the hands of Mrs.  Parminter.</p>
<p>The  latter silently motioned our visitor to follow her up-stairs, and, arrived at  the room in which her son lay, stretched upon a mattress on the floor (for no  bedstead would accommodate his length of limb), she opened the door just wide  enough to exhibit Jacob&rsquo;s enormous feet.</p>
<p>The  mother looked astonished. &ldquo;Now see his legs ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mrs. Parminter, as she  widened the opening.</p>
<p>There  was a faint scream from the mother as she sat down and placed the giant&rsquo;s head  in her lap.</p>
<p>It  was some time before Jacob realized the fact of the relationship, but when he  fully comprehended it he exhibited considerable emotion.</p>
<p>I  have little more to tell, save that the furniture van was again brought into  request, the doctor advising immediate change of air (a serious relapse having  occurred), and he was carried to a little cottage in the outskirts of London,  where, after lingering a few weeks, he died quietly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="AChristmasTragedy"></a>A Christmas  Tragedy</strong></h1>
<p>It  was Christmas-tide at Greystone Abbey, and a large party had assembled to keep  up the festive occasion; all friends and relations of the warm-hearted,  generous host, Squire Wintour, who was known and beloved through the county.  Among all classes of men he was a favorite; with those of his own rank in life  a stanch friend and jovial companion; while the poor never looked for help in  vain from his well-filled purse, nor for sound counsel and advice from his  keen, good sense, and shrewd, clear judgment. To women he was always courteous,  polished, and gentle. A conscientious landlord, a bold rider; loving the whinny  of his hunter and the voices of his hounds, as though they were his children. A  man of the old school was Sir Edmund Wintour, but though a baronet, it was  seldom his title was heard in Blankshire, and as &ldquo;Squire Wintour&rdquo; he was known  and spoken of by all. He preferred the simple cognomen, and discouraged the use  of the more sounding appellation, wishing to be among them, as his father had  been before him, an old English gentleman.</p>
<p>At  sixty-five years of age he was still hale and hearty, sustaining his position  as master of the fox-hounds with credit and pleasure; wherever he went faces  smiled and eyes brightened, his kind heart awakening responsive echoes; but no  lady reigned at Greystone Abbey, and none had ever so reigned.</p>
<p>Once  in the past, long ago, there had been a love-story in the life of Squire  Wintour, and it had been his only one. His love-dream had come to him in this  wise. Forty years ago he had met a young and beautiful woman: she was all he  could desire for a wife; the daughter of an earl, with a fortune which rendered  her independent of the handsome settlements which her eager young lover had  secured to her. If Lady Rosalind had a fault, it was pride; and upon this point  only were the minds of Sir Edmund and his lady-love not in unison.</p>
<p>The  Abbey had been prepared for the reception of the bride; nothing that affection  and devotion could dictate was wanting. The bells in the old square-towered  ivy-clad church of Greystone rang out clear and joyously in honor of the day  appointed for the wedding; but the marriage had taken place some twenty miles  away, at the residence of the Earl of Showborough, the father of the bride.</p>
<p>At  Showborough Towers there is a gay scene: the bells of that village church ring  out even more triumphantly than those of Greystone Abbey. Places often take  their coloring and manners from the leading people of the neighborhood. The  Earl of Showborough and his family never did things on a small scale: all was  imposing and grand about them; and upon the occasion of the marriage of the  eldest daughter (Lady Rosalind) there was to be a complete gala.</p>
<p>At  Greystone things were done more simply, with greater comfort, though far less  display.</p>
<p>Sir  Edmund had but lately lost his father, and he had begged that the wedding  should be a quiet one; but Lady Rosalind would not for a moment hear of such a  thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  your father has not been dead a year Edmund, we must wait until that time has  expired, if it is to interfere with our doing the thing properly. A month or  two one way or the other cannot make much difference to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  would make a great deal to me my darling,&rdquo; whispered the lover; &ldquo;but at any  time I should plead for a quiet wedding. It seems to me no fit day for  merry-making, but for serious thought. Then I should wish to take my bride <em>home</em> not abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will concede the latter point, Edmund,&rdquo; replied Lady Rosalind: &ldquo;we can travel  later; but the humdrum wedding is impossible. Papa would not hear of it, and  every one would say I am ashamed of my choice. I should not like it at all, and  you know the lady does as she pleases before marriage; the gentleman has no  voice in such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  Sir Edmund Wintour was silenced, though not convinced, and the arrangements for  the grand occasion went on.</p>
<p>The  day before the wedding Lady Rosalind said, &ldquo;You will have four horses of course  to take us home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dearest,&rdquo; he answered, playfully, &ldquo;that will be <em>after </em>marriage; and I have only arranged for a pair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you will change the order when you know I have set my heart upon a team,&rdquo; she  pleaded, raising her pretty eyes to his. &ldquo;You have plenty of horses, and you  will not refuse your wife her first request, I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  drew her to him, and kissing her white brow, promised that he would do his best  to please her, but told her that he had not at that time four horses which had  run together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put  two of your hunters as leaders,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;you are never short of those  animals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will have them tried this evening, Rosalind; and if they go well in harness,  you shall have your wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  horses went grandly through the quiet park and along the lanes of Greystone,  driven by their master himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  are as gentle as lambs,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;We will have them to bring us home  to-morrow, Simson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  stud-groom touched his hat, and the matter was settled. But it is one thing for  horses to go quietly where there is nothing to excite or alarm them, and quite  another when bells are ringing, a band playing, the voices of the villagers  cheering amid hundreds of waving hats, the fluttering of many-hued flags, the  incessant movement of a rustic crowd, eager to see all that is going on.</p>
<p>The  carriage was hemmed in by a living wall. Some thirty village maidens stood in  the front rank, with baskets on their arms, laden with spring flowers.</p>
<p>Every  one was waiting, still and expectant.</p>
<p>The  bride and bridegroom appeared under the massive stone portal of the Towers.</p>
<p>A  shout from the crowd made the untrained leaders plunge.</p>
<p>A  volley of flowers from the girls&rsquo; baskets did not add to their steadiness  Kisses and tears and smiles; smiles and tears and kisses.</p>
<p>The  bells clash out, the horses are becoming unmanageable; but the bride is safely  seated, and the bridegroom has followed her. The servants have taken their  places outside the handsome traveling carriage; the grooms have let go the  horses&rsquo; heads and are scrambling up behind like monkeys. They have started.</p>
<p>The  band crashes out the &ldquo;Wedding March.&rdquo; The people cheer. Hats and flags are  raised amid a surging sea of men, women, and children, and the sound of many  voices.</p>
<p>Shoes  strike the terrified animals on one side; on the other a storm of flowers. They  start with a rush; and at that unlucky moment the bride remembers some trifle  she has left behind. The horses are pulled on their haunches, and Sir Edmund,  at his wife&rsquo;s desire, jumps out, and runs back to do her bidding. It was only a  traveling cloak that he had to fetch, but it was not so easy to find as had  been expected.</p>
<p>The  bells clashed on; the drummer was energetic; the village folks thronged around  the carriage. There was a rush; a wild stampede; cries of horror rent the air.  The grooms had sprung from their places, but only to be hurled to the ground by  the terrified advancing horses. Even yet the driver could have guided them; but  Lady Rosalind, losing her presence of mind, jumped from the open carriage-door,  and falling heavily, lay there, motionless, upon the ground.</p>
<p>It  was her young husband for whom the frightened crowd fell back. He ran swiftly,  with a white, set face to the spot. Tenderly he lifted her, tenderly he bore  her in his arms to the home of her girlhood. It was the only one she would ever  know upon earth: for she was dead!</p>
<p>There  was no disfigurement upon the beautiful face, but her neck was broken, and  death had been instantaneous.</p>
<p>And  so she went back, and the voices which had cheered now mourned her. The bright  faces were now pale and awe-stricken; and a great silence accompanied the  lifeless bride as she was carried to the house. The waving hats were still, as  the men stood, with bent, uncovered heads, to let that sad burden go by. The  flags were lowered; the flowers lay crushed beneath their feet; the band was  mute: but the bells rang on!</p>
<p>Ah!  stop them, stop them! Bid them toll, toll softly and sadly, a passing knell!  For the bride has entered an unknown life, and set out on her last solemn  journey, alone. So Squire Wintour went back, a solitary man, to the home he had  prepared for his bride with such loving care; and for the sake of her who had  been his wife only for three short hours, he mourned a lifetime. No woman&rsquo;s  hand smoothed his path: no children&rsquo;s footsteps pattered through his home, nor  awoke its echoes with rippling laughter.</p>
<p>But  when the struggle was over, the squire took his place again among his  neighbors, and resumed the ancient customs which had ever been kept up in his  dear old home, within his memory, and long, long before.</p>
<p>Christmas-tide  always saw the Abbey filled with guests. The present Christmas was no exception  to the yearly institution.</p>
<p>The  carved oak of the dining-hall, which was well-nigh black with age, was  decorated with evergreens and bright-berried holly. Nor was the mistletoe  forgotten. And this work of garlanding was always done by the visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,&rdquo;  laughed a good-looking young man (whose great pleasure in life seemed to  consist in teasing everybody by turns), &ldquo;I thought you were a good church  woman! How can you go in for such heathenish customs? Do you not know that it  was the Druids who began the practice of decorating? They used to deck their  houses with greenery in the winter-time for the sylvan spirits to come and  shelter in, because it was too cold for the little darlings out-of-doors, with  no leaves on the trees in the charming groves. Fie upon you, my cousin, for  copying your pagan ancestors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see why I shouldn&rsquo;t, Reginald,&rdquo; replied the timid-eyed girl. &ldquo;It seems to  me that it was very kind of them to provide the poor little wood-sprites with a  home when they were in need of one. If there are any left in these days I hope  they will shelter here, I am sure. But even if they did, I am afraid they would  not be visible to us mortals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should they not be visible as well as ghosts, Maudie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ghosts! Who believes in them in the nineteenth century?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  every one with any sense does: the wonder is that so <em>few</em> spirits come back, not how many. Why, we are surrounded by  spirits, my dear girl; they are brushing against us every hour of the day. Do  you not feel a shiver run through you sometimes? Yes! I thought so; just as  though some cold water trickled down your back. That is when one of <em>ces messieurs la</em> touches you; the  contact with the immortals runs through you like electricity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish you would not talk like that, Reginald,&rdquo; answered the girl, turning very  pale. &ldquo;I suppose I am a little coward, but when people speak of such things I  tremble all over. See how I shake! And do you know I think I inherit it from  papa; for although he always pretends he does not fear anything or anybody, he  sleeps with a loaded revolver under his pillow. No one knows it, I suppose, but  he really does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now  Maud&rsquo;s father, Maurice Wintour, was the eldest nephew of Sir Edmund Wintour,  and therefore his heir-presumptive, both as regarded his title and his  property, which was entailed; whereas his great-nephew, Reginald Montague, was  the grandson of his youngest brother, who had gone before him over to the great  majority, having left a daughter (Mrs. Montague), Reginald&rsquo;s mother.</p>
<p>Maurice  Wintour had one child only, this fair young daughter, Maud. He was a man of  nearly forty years of age, with the same shrinking, large, dark eyes which we  have noticed in the daughter.</p>
<p>They  were somehow, in the man, not dependable eyes, and gave you the idea of  weakness, if not cowardice. For the rest Mr. Maurice Wintour was rather a  handsome man than otherwise, with a vast share of assurance of manner, which  amounted at times to braggadocio; especially when the gentleman in question  gave you an account of his own daring in the Indian jungles, where he professed  to have been after large game; and many a fine skin which decorated his rooms  was shown by him as the result of his own prowess; though there were people who  were unkind enough to say that the great naturalist in Wigmore Street could  tell a different story.</p>
<p>Nor  were these his only wonderful feats. He had volunteered for service under the  &ldquo;Stars and Stripes&rdquo; during the civil war in America, and had, according to his  own account, greatly distinguished himself. But there were those among his  friends who said he had not joined the army at all, and others who vowed he was  never seen after the first shots were fired.</p>
<p>One  is apt to take a grain of salt with all stories which have crossed the  Atlantic; and perhaps the narrations of his own doughty deeds were not more  highly colored by Mr. Maurice Wintour than are those of most other men  returning from the New World.</p>
<p>With  reference to his nephew and heir, the feelings of Squire Wintour were very  mixed. As the son of his brother, who, being only a year two his junior, had  been the friend and companion of his life, he loved him. But he was far from  pleased with the manners of the man.</p>
<p>The  blatant stories of his nephew&rsquo;s adventures by flood and field were repugnant to  the squire&rsquo;s nature, and it was with difficulty he could sit them through; but  he was really fond of little Maud, and partly for her sake, and partly for that  of his dead mother, Maurice was dear to him. Indeed, the man possessed many  good qualities, and the coating of boastfulness was in reality put on to cover  his want of courage; of which he was ashamed, but which he had not the strength  of mind to overcome.</p>
<p>Between  Maud and her cousin Reginald Montague there existed one of those boy and girl  affections which so often crop up between cousins in youth and ripen into love  in after-years, quarreling and making it up again being a large element in  their intercourse, and a vast amount of teasing on the part of the lad, which  too often ended in tears upon that of the girl. Reginald Montague had ever been  too fond of tormenting his acquaintances; it had been all his life the blot in  his character.</p>
<p>Playing  tricks upon people was the very breath of his nostrils, and the more annoyed or  irritated the victims of his jokes appeared, the more he enjoyed the fun.</p>
<p>Even  with those he really loved he carried on this foolish practice, taking a keen  pleasure in their vexation or fright; and poor little Maud herself was not  spared, though he cared more for her than for any one else in the world.</p>
<p>Upon  the present occasion she knew by the twinkle in his merry blue eyes that he was  bent on mischief, and shook her glossy head at him reprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reg,&rdquo;  she said, harshly, &ldquo;you are going to do something you ought not to; I see it in  your face. Come, confess now what it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Confess!  That&rsquo;s likely!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Why, you would tell every one in confidence all  round the house. I know what you girls are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maud  grew serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  must be something wrong if you will not tell me,&rdquo; she said, sadly. &ldquo;Oh, Reggie,  do give up playing tricks upon people. You don&rsquo;t mean any harm, I know, but one  can never tell how these pranks of yours will turn out. People would be much  fonder of you if you were less of a torment.&rdquo; And tears were very near the  surface of her tender, timid eyes.</p>
<p>The  young man seemed touched for a moment. He came closer to his cousin and patted  her with caressing fingers. A flush rose to his cheek, and he leaned over her,  and looked into her eyes.</p>
<p>He  was very fond of his cousin, but boyhood had so lately been left behind that he  scarcely knew his own mind for ten minutes consecutively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you care more for me, Maudie?&rdquo; he asked, tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think so, Reg,&rdquo; she replied, with her eyes cast down, twining a spray of  tendriled ivy in and out her slender fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;ll try,&rdquo; he began, but his sentence was cut short by the entrance of a  gentleman, who made straight toward them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,  my dear, have you not yet finished these decorations? It is time you dressed  for dinner. Remember, it is earlier than usual to-night, for the Mummers in the  evening. See, here comes the Yule log to cheer us; and the servants want to get  rid of you out of the hall that they may attend to their duties.&rdquo;</p>


<p>&ldquo;They  will not mind me, papa,&rdquo; answered the girl, with a smile. &ldquo;But I will be very  quick now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  cannot remain here, my dear, while the domestics are laying the cloth; the  squire might not like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I will answer for Uncle Edmund,&rdquo; interrupted Reginald.</p>
<p>But  Mr. Wintour ignored his remark, putting him aside with a slight wave of his  hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is a pity, my dear, that you should have wasted your time gossiping here with  your cousin: it would have been better had you set him to work and made him  useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reginald&rsquo;s  eyes flashed.</p>
<p>If  there was one person more than another who aroused the spirit of antagonism and  mischief in him it was his uncle Maurice.</p>
<p>And  Maud&rsquo;s words were forgotten.</p>
<p>That  night at dinner the conversation turned upon things ghostly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most  old houses have legends attached to them, I fancy, which are handed down from  generation to generation,&rdquo; said Sir Edmund, with his kindly smile. &ldquo;Not only  written ones, however, but tales that are told on Christmas-eve around the  blazing fire, and make one feel as if cold water were trickling down one&rsquo;s  spine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!  nonsense, my dear uncle,&rdquo; said Mr. Wintour. &ldquo;I cannot believe it of you. As for  myself, it must be a horrible story indeed to make me shiver, I can assure you.  A man who has been accustomed to walk among the slain on the field of battle  would scarcely mind childish stories told round a warm hearth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  much the better, my dear Maurice, as you have the haunted chamber,&rdquo; laughed the  Squire. &ldquo;Perhaps you were not aware that Greystone Abbey boasted its ghost; and  now I come to think of it, Christmas-eve is the very night the specter is said  to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It  did not escape the keen eyes of Reginald Montague that Mr. Wintour grew so  white as to look almost livid, or that he drained his glass before he replied,  or that the hand which lifted it trembled; and he chuckled over the discovery.  He determined to draw Sir Edmund out for the benefit of his uncle Maurice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am very thankful you did not select that room for me, sir,&rdquo; he said, solemnly;  &ldquo;for I have a perfect terror of ghosts. Is this a very horrible nocturnal  visitor, sir? Perhaps you will tell us the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  confess the truth, Reginald, I have never slept in that apartment, so cannot  speak from experience; but I have heard that those who have done so awake with  a curious feeling of oppression; their senses seem to be leaving them; they  fancy that they are chained to their bed; that they are not alone in the room.  Some speak of seeing a figure; others declare that the spirit cannot be seen,  only felt; that it rustles past them with a chill blast, as though the wind had  swept through the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Wintour&rsquo;s shifting dark eyes were dilated; he seemed scarcely to have power  even to keep up appearances, and his complexion became ashen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle  Maurice is in a blooming fright,&rdquo; whispered Reginald to his younger brother. &ldquo;Tom,  we&rsquo;ll have some fun out of this. Keep up the talk, pile on the agony, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom,  who during the dressing-time had heard about Mr. Wintour&rsquo;s pistol, now solemnly  stated that if he saw a ghost he should shoot him, which caused a great deal of  laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  what good would that do?&rdquo; said Reginald, affecting superior knowledge; &ldquo;a  bullet would not hurt a spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  I&rsquo;d put in two,&rdquo; cried the incorrigible Tom; which caused fresh merriment among  the guests; but Maud was gazing at her father with a saddened face.</p>
<p>The  Mummers came and performed their fooleries, the wassail-cup went round; &ldquo;Sir  Roger de Coverley&rdquo; had been danced; the &ldquo;Waits&rdquo; were singing their carols at  the door, and all within Greystone Abbey were clustering around the windows, or  gathered in the hall to listen. A hand crept into that of Reginald Montague as  he stood beside a heavy curtain, peering out into the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Maud, you are just the very person I was wishing to see,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am  I? That is well, for I want you,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I feel nervous to-night. I have  a weight upon my spirits. Oh! Reg, I know by your face you are going to do some  mischief; will you not tell me what it is? I am always afraid that you will get  into some terrible scrape, and it makes me miserable;&rdquo; and there was a catch in  the girl&rsquo;s voice which told of tears not far off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maudie,  my dear little cousin, don&rsquo;t be foolish. I am only going to get a rise out of a  magnificent fish; and you will forgive me for this once; you always do forgive  me, Maudie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  drew the girl toward him there in the darkness. They were not listening to the  Waits, those two; they were listening to the voice of young love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  I vex you very much, dear?&rdquo; asked the young man. &ldquo;Well, make it worth my while  to become a better sort of fellow, Maudie. Tell me you will be my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am  I not too young?&rdquo; inquired the girl, in a startled voice, yet clinging to him.  &ldquo;Oh! dear Reg, I am sure they will all say so. They will not let me marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  to-day, or to-morrow, little kitten; nor this day week, perhaps; but some day,  my Maud. Tell me it shall be&mdash;some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  some day, dear,&rdquo; answered the girl, with a sigh: &ldquo;that <em>some day</em> may never come; but I will promise you one thing&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  what is that, Maudie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will never marry any other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,  you are a darling: you are my darling,&rdquo; he cried, kissing her brow fondly. &ldquo;I  must see this bit of fun out. Then, for your sake, I will be as steady as old  Time. Kiss me just once, Maudie, and seal the compact.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * * *</p>
<p>It  was after midnight.</p>
<p>Two  figures crept furtively along the corridor leading to the chamber occupied by  Maurice Wintour.</p>
<p>One  was tall, and as the moon glittered on it from the old casement in the  deep-recessed wall, it looked more like a tenant of the ethereal world than of  the real. It was clad in white, and shone with a phosphorescent light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you sure you drew the charge?&rdquo; whispered the tall creature, stooping down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure  as eggs are eggs,&rdquo; answers the other; &ldquo;and by the same token that the bullets  are in my waistcoat pocket. Blest if he must not have been in a blue funk to  put in two!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give  them to me, Tom. I have an idea: when he fires, I&rsquo;ll roll them back at him. By  Jove! what a fright he will be in. He will tell every one how he has been shot  at by a ghost! He&rsquo;ll never laugh at the genii again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  chuckle arose from the smaller figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,  Tom; some one will hear you&mdash;h-u-s-h: now for it.&rdquo; Gently he turned the handle  of the door, but with no effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  he has locked himself in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible;  here is the key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well!  I can&rsquo;t open the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  must have barricaded it. What&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother  him! after all our trouble, too,&rdquo; complained the ghost. &ldquo;But no, I remember  something. I have not seen it for years, but I am sure there used to be a  secret entrance to that room. There&rsquo;s some wonderful story attached to it. One  of the Royalists was hidden there in the reign of Charles the First. It was his  wife who was murdered in that room, because she would not reveal her husband&rsquo;s  whereabouts to the Roundheads. Now, I come to think of it, I am personating  that royal lady. We must go back to our room and get a candle. I can&rsquo;t hit on the  spring in the dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  felt their way back to their chamber, and having armed themselves with a light,  the curious white figure led the way down a narrow passage. There was a door at  the end of it, bolted and barred. He did not attempt to open it, but holding  the candle above his head, he passed his disengaged hand along the wall, high  up. Presently he stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought so,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Now for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  time he stooped down, and close to the floor he came upon a tiny knob. He  pressed upon it, as he had done a similar one at the top. &ldquo;Open, Sesame!&rdquo; he  whispered, as a part of the wall slid quietly back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;That  beats Banagher!&rsquo;&rdquo; exclaimed the astonished boy, with his mouth open. &ldquo;Why, Reg,  you&rsquo;re a second Aladdin! Where&rsquo;s your wonderful lamp?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without  pausing to reply, his brother pushed on into a dark and gloomy passage, which  smelt cold and damp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I say, Reg, this is not a pleasant place!&rdquo; whispered Tom; but the other went  on. Again he searched the wall, and once more a way opened before him; and the  two stood in a small square apartment, which felt like a well. There was no  window, but a skylight in the roof; and looking up, they could see a glimmer of  the moon&rsquo;s rays even through the cobwebbed glass. There was an old oak table in  the room, decayed and worm-eaten, and a small oaken bedstead, upon which,  probably, the dainty Cavalier had rested when lying <em>perdu</em> from his enemies. Once more the phosphorescent figure felt  about the walls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here  is the last spring, Tom. Blow out the candle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  boy obeyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a lark!&rdquo; he muttered, as the panel slipped back, and they peeped into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  care he does not see you.&rdquo; whispered the white figure. &ldquo;Why, he actually burns  a night-light!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On glided  the supposed apparition, with a rustling sound, as it swept by the foot of the  bed, the phosphorus gleaming in the semidarkness.</p>
<p>The  man in the bed moved uneasily, hastily pushing the clothes from about his ears;  then his dark, terrified eyes rested on the moving figure. He sat up in bed,  his eyeballs starting from their sockets, his livid face white and corpse-like  in the dim light. Then, with an agonized gesture, he sought under his pillow,  and in another instant the flash and report of a pistol went through the room.  At the same moment the specter at the bed-foot raised its arm with a menacing  gesture, and from its hand rolled across the bed the two bullets which the  terrified man believed he had just discharged at the denizen of another world,  who, passing on unharmed, vanished through the wall of the room.</p>
<p>The  man watched its disappearance with straining eyes, and with a groan fell  forward upon the bed.</p>
<p>Gently  the panel was closed; quietly the two conspirators crept away.</p>
<p>The  man&rsquo;s terror seemed to have awed them, and neither of the two laughed or spoke  till they reached their own room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wish we had not done it, Tom,&rdquo; said Reginald, regretfully. &ldquo;Why, he looked like  a ghost himself in that glimmering light. He has given me the blues. There,  that&rsquo;s my last practical joke. Tom, I&rsquo;m going to marry Maud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  will her father say to that arrangement, after the trick you have played on him  to-night&mdash;eh, Reg?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never thought of that,&rdquo; replied the other, blankly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see how he is  to know that it was a trick; and if so, no one but you could inform him I was  the culprit; and I don&rsquo;t think you will blab, Tom, old boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  if they dragged me with wild horses,&rdquo; answered the lad, clasping his brother&rsquo;s  hand affectionately; &ldquo;and Maud is a jolly little girl, Reg. I wish you joy with  her, old fellow&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  the two bade each other good-night, and jumping into bed, slept soundly.</p>
<p>They  did not even hear the knock at their door in the early morning which announced  their hot water; nor did they awake until the roll of the time-mellowed gong  resounded through the house.</p>
<p>The  brothers exchanged a hearty greeting as they hastily took in their cans of  water, and tumbled into their baths.</p>
<p>They  were laughing and talking and dressing hastily, all at once, when a shadow  passed across Reginald&rsquo;s heart, and his face fell, as he said;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wonder how Uncle Maurice is this morning, Tom? What a blessed fright he was in  to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was mighty lucky Maud told you about the pistol, Reg, or he would have spotted  you, for a certainty,&rdquo; replied Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  it was fortunate you drew that double charge of his,&rdquo; said Reginald, with a  smile.</p>
<p>They  went down together, both feeling somewhat sheepish and guilty. Reginald, with a  sensation which he could hardly himself understand, that he would rather not  meet the timid, fawn-like eyes of his cousin Maud, his almost affianced wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  happy Christmas to you all,&rdquo; he cried, as he entered the breakfast-room, going  the round of the table, with a hearty shake of the hand to each.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,  this is quite a Christmas of the olden time, frost and snow outside, bright  faces and glowing logs within. Only look at those icicles hanging at the  windows. A foot long, if they are an inch. Where is Maud? Not down yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Maudie is never late, Master Reginald; she has had her breakfast. Look at home  for lazybones,&rdquo; answered the squire, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir, yes! I am afraid Tom and I overslept ourselves. We must apologize for not  being down earlier. But what has become of Maud?&rdquo; he continued, looking round  the room in search of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  has gone up to see after her father. Like yourself, he is late this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without  another word Reginald took his seat at the table, and there was an anxious look  upon his face as he and his brother exchanged glances.</p>
<p>In  a few seconds Maud entered the room, with a pale, scared countenance.</p>
<p>She  came straight up to Sir Edmund, and laid her hand upon his shoulder, as though  leaning upon him for strength.</p>
<p>She  looked very white, and her timid eyes were distended with fear; and as he gazed  at her, Reginald remembered her father&rsquo;s eyes of the night before; and a spasm  of regret shot through his heart, that he should have been led away by his  foolish love of mischief and teasing to do anything that could bring a cloud  upon the face of the girl he loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo;  she said. &ldquo;he will not let me in; he will not answer me. I have knocked again  and again. He must hear me, but he will not reply. Oh, uncle, he must be ill!  What shall I do? what shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  squire rose at once and took her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear little Maudie, there is nothing to frighten you. What could possibly be  the matter? Your father is sleeping soundly; that is all, you may be sure.  Perhaps the ghost disturbed his early slumbers, and he is making up for lost  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  face of Reginald Montague had turned very pale; he too feared that the absent  man was ill, remembering his look the night before, and as Sir Edmund and Maud  left the room together, he rose and followed them.</p>
<p>In  vain they knocked. There was no reply from within the closed door.</p>
<p>One  by one the guests came up into the old corridor, attracted there by anxiety or  curiosity. The idea that &ldquo;something was the matter&rdquo; had spread even among the  servants. Then the squire&rsquo;s voice was heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  cannot break open this door; it is too strong. Send for the blacksmith. The  lock must be picked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  door is not locked. I took away the key last night for a joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  all eyes were turned on Reginald Montague.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  Reggie, Reggie,&rdquo; cried his cousin Maud, with a scared look, &ldquo;what have you  done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  grant I may have done no harm,&rdquo; he answered, earnestly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reggie,&rdquo;  said the girl, with her white face set and rigid, &ldquo;if you have harmed my father  I will <em>never</em>, <em>never</em> forgive you!&rdquo; And for once the blue eyes which looked all men  so freely in the face fell before those of his cousin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  door must be barricaded,&rdquo; he said, addressing himself to the squire. &ldquo;Shall we  force it open, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young men of the party stepped forward at his words. One&mdash;two&mdash;three;  crash&mdash;crash&mdash;crash; and down went chairs, tables, and boxes; which had been  carefully piled against the woodwork; and into the wreck of fallen and broken  furniture stepped Maud Wintour&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the still figure, lying face downward upon the bed, neither stirred nor  answered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  papa! papa! speak to me!&rdquo; she cried, her words rising into a sob.</p>
<p>But  there was no voice nor any sound that replied to her piteous cry, as she stood  with her white hands clasped, and the horror increasing in her eyes; for they  had raised her father, and he was gazing back at her with glazed and distended  orbs, which told their own sad tale.</p>
<p>It  was Squire Wintour who led her away, white and stricken, with a firm but gentle  hand.</p>
<p>It  was Reginald Montague who fell upon his knees by the dead man&rsquo;s side with that  exceeding bitter cry: &ldquo;My God! I have murdered him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was his brother Tom who came and clasped his hand, and tried to comfort him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  Reg, it was I as much as you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon  the bed were two bullets.</p>
<p>In  the cold, stiff hand a pistol was grasped.</p>
<p>There  was no want of courage, either moral or physical, in Reginald Montague. He  begged all present to come down-stairs with him and hear the truth; and  silently they followed him into the presence of their host. Then, standing  before them, he confessed what he had done: he suppressed nothing, palliated  nothing.</p>
<p>The  whole story was summed up in a few words: he had played a practical joke, with  very serious results.</p>
<p>He  had personated a ghost, had apparently come through the wall and had frightened  a man&mdash;and that man his uncle&mdash;to death! And the pale faces of all who listened  condemned him.</p>
<p>And  the holly and the mistletoe were taken down, and the blinds were lowered, and  all went softly; for a dead man lay within those walls, and the living mourned  him. The inquest was over; the funeral had taken place; the saddened Christmas  was passed, and the New Year had come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo;  said Reginald, entering Sir Edmund&rsquo;s study, &ldquo;I have come to say good-bye. I can  bear this life no longer, and I must go away. How you must wish I had never  come under your roof! Nothing can undo what my folly has done; nothing can ever  bring Maud&rsquo;s father back to life, and I shall never regain her love! What is  there left for me to do but to take myself away, and hope that time may soften  her sorrow, and help her to forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  perhaps it will be better to do so for a little while, my dear boy; but you  must not let past mistakes unfit you for future duties. You do not yet realize  that your poor uncle&rsquo;s death has left you my heir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  sir, do not tell me that I am to benefit by my uncle&rsquo;s death; I could not bear  it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are my nearest male relative, and must take my name, and of course you will  inherit my estates. Except by a Royal warrant, the baronetcy would not be  yours, but I shall try and arrange that before I die. Reginald, I have no son;  you must be one to me. And, my boy, do not let poor Maurice&rsquo;s death dwell too  much on your mind. Remember, he was found to have heart disease to a serious  extent, and any sudden excitement or fright might have killed him. Travel for a  year, then come back to me, and I will teach you what we Wintours consider a  county squire should be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Veritable  tears rose to the young man&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;You are too good to me,&rdquo; he answered, in a  broken voice.</p>
<p>Then  in silence they clasped hands, and parted.</p>
<p>It  was five years after this conversation. Few who had been acquainted with  Reginald Montague would have known him again. The look of mischief has died out  of his eyes; they are now grave and earnest, with a touch of sadness in their  expression. The bright face has changed into one of serious intelligence. He  smiles sometimes, a sweet, quiet smile, but the ringing laugh lies on the other  side of Maurice Wintour&rsquo;s grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,&rdquo;  he said, as he leaned toward her with a yearning tenderness, &ldquo;will your answer  ever be the same?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever,&rdquo;  she replied. &ldquo;My father stands between us. Anything else I could put aside; but  not my father. Still, I will respect my promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  cousin, I give you back your promise. Marry whom you please; and may you be  happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  he rose to leave her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will never doubt how I have loved you?&rdquo; she asked, pitifully. &ldquo;Ah! Reg, Reg, it  is hard; but it cannot be.&rdquo; he held her cold hands; he looked into her eyes; he  stooped and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye,  good-bye, my wife!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;No other woman shall ever bear that name. May  God ever watch between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is all over, uncle,&rdquo; said Reginald Montague, sinking into a chair in his  uncle&rsquo;s study. &ldquo;Maud will not forgive me. I shall never marry now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,  my dear old boy!&rdquo; cried Tom&rsquo;s hearty voice; &ldquo;you have a happy life before you  yet; you could not be so punished for a boyish frolic. Go back; do not take No  for an answer. Believe me, Maud loves you, and is at this moment crying as  though her heart would break because you have left her. Strike while the iron  is hot, and good-luck to you!&rdquo; Saying which, Tom took his brother by both  shoulders and pushed him out of the room.</p>
<p>Reginald  walked slowly through the hall, and stood hesitating at the door of the  drawing-room, where he had left Maud.</p>
<p>Yes;  he too heard her sobs. Gently he turned the handle and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Reginald, my darling! it was the last time: you have gone from me forever!  Father! father! I have given up my happiness for your sake. Tell me, show me by  some sign whether I have done right. Oh! father, you know how I loved him. I  had told you that very night, and you smiled; you said he would be your heir,  and you would be glad, when I was older, to see me married to him. Then, when  that dreadful day came, I promised you in death that it should never be. I told  Reginald I would never forgive him. But, dear father, pardon me, I <em>have forgiven him</em>; and now, only for  that old promise sake, I have sent him from me forever&mdash;forever! Tell me, have I  done right? Show me some sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was pleading upon her knees, with her face upturned.</p>
<p>Had  her dead father indeed led him back to her? he wondered.</p>
<p>He  went gently to her, and clasping her cold hands in his, raised her up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,&rdquo;  he whispered, &ldquo;he has sent you a sign. I had left you forever; but I believe he  has drawn me back to you. I have heard your words, my darling. Let the mental  suffering I have endured for these five years atone for my sin, and let the  memory which I must carry through my life of what I have done be my punishment.  Believe me, Maud, it is, and will be no light one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  somehow to-day I feel that your poor father has forgiven me. Maud, I cannot  leave you. See how my hair, young as I am, is already sprinkled with silver. Do  not condemn me to a solitary life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  shall never have that, my dear old Reg,&rdquo; cried a voice at the door; &ldquo;I for one  will stick to you like a leech!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They  both started at the sound, and there before them, looking into the room, they  saw Tom and the squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maud,  my dear child,&rdquo; said the latter, kindly, &ldquo;Reginald has been punished  sufficiently; his looks tell you how he has suffered. See how five years of  sorrow have altered him. So long as he lives he will never cease to repent the  folly which ended so fatally. Be generous, Maud; let by-gones be by-gones. If  you still love him, be his wife; he needs a comforter, believe me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  dear uncle, I do indeed love him. But may I break a promise?&rdquo; she asked,  turning her timid eyes upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  foolish one is better honored in the breach than the observance,&rdquo; he answered;  &ldquo;and I am sure I am but echoing your father&rsquo;s wishes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  Reg,&rdquo; she cried, her tears falling fast, &ldquo;I have been so miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  Sir Edmund placed the hand he still held in that of Reginald Montague; and  passing his arm through Tom&rsquo;s, drew him from the room.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Austen, allow me to introduce Colonel Craven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  smile&mdash;a bow&mdash;and the speaker and his partner passed on, Colonel Craven resuming  his lounging attitude against the doorway.</p>
<p>A  few simple words&mdash;the ordinary commonplace words in an ordinary commonplace  ball-room, but resulting in the misery of two lives.</p>
<p>Oh!  if those words had never been spoken&mdash;if that introduction had never been made!  This is what we all feel when the blow has fallen&mdash;what a little would have  averted it, if we had only known!</p>
<p>The  scene is a military ball in the old garrison town of Pontham. A new regiment  had arrived the week before, and partly to welcome them, partly to return  hospitality freely offered, the 160th gave a ball to the principal inhabitants,  and several of the county families round&mdash;including the Austens of Beechwood  Park, some six miles off. (Pontham was a place where the military were &ldquo;<em>immensely appreciated</em>;&rdquo; balls, picnics,  all amusements were fixed with reference to the soldiers, and the soldiers returned  the compliment, many an officer voting Pontham a very jolly place&mdash;one of the  best quarters in England.)</p>
<p>If  ever a girl enjoyed a ball, it was Cicely Austen, the youngest daughter of the  Squire of Beechwood. The dancing, the absolute motion, was delightful to her,  still more delightful the talking, or as she expressed it, &ldquo;the fun of a  ball-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely  was in a certain way a flirt&mdash;what you might call an &ldquo;open flirt;&rdquo; she never  fell in love with her numerous admirers, or pretended to do so; still less did  she expect them to fall in love with her; but she liked talking to men in a frank,  half-cousinly way, frequently dancing half an evening with one partner, because  he was &ldquo;such a nice fellow,&rdquo; and amused her. She was the kind of a girl most  men like all their lives&mdash;make a firm friend and confidante of, but rarely fall  in love with: so now, at the age of twenty-one, she was &ldquo;fancy free.&rdquo; If, as  some assert, every true woman must love once in her life, Cicely Austen&rsquo;s time  had not come yet.</p>
<p>This  ball she was, as usual, enjoying immensely, and the evening was half over when,  coming from a small tea-room with her partner, who, though one of the newly-arrived  regiment, was a cousin, and had known her from childhood&mdash;he stopped at the door  to speak to a brother officer, and turning to Cicely, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow  me to introduce Colonel Craven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely  hardly heard the name&mdash;was conscious that a tall man bowed, as he made room for  her to pass, and never looked at him&mdash;only laughingly turned to George Read.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,  I suppose, is one of your people? Is that your way, to come to a ball, and lean  against the wall the whole time? Perhaps, like the celebrated 10th, <em>you don&rsquo;t dance</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel  Craven (he was only brevet-colonel, given the brevet with his Victoria Cross  for brave deeds during the Indian Mutiny) watched them for a few minutes,  thought, &ldquo;What a bright face; how she enjoys herself,&rdquo; then troubled himself no  more, till, a quarter of an hour later, his musings were interrupted by a  voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  say, Craven, I wish you would be more sociable. Why don&rsquo;t you make yourself  agreeable? I introduced you to the jolliest girl in these parts. She&rsquo;s a  first-rate dancer too; and I declare you never took the trouble to ask her. All  these people will vote us the slowest set alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a bore you are! Can&rsquo;t you leave a fellow alone? I tell you, Read, when you are  my age you&rsquo;ll think there&rsquo;s no greater nuisance than this kind of thing. I  don&rsquo;t know why I came. I hate it. I shall go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I say, don&rsquo;t. I swear the people will be offended. We sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t get an invite to  anything if we begin like this. You must stay; they don&rsquo;t get a Victoria Cross  man every day. Go and dance for the credit of the regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bother  the regiment! Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Read; go and do it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  he spoke, his eyes involuntarily followed a couple just opposite; and as they  moved, he was struck more and more with the peculiar fascination of the lady.  She was no regular beauty, had not even well-cut features; yet there were many  that thought the dark, expressive eyes, brilliant complexion, and abundant  hair&mdash;almost too abundant for the small head, so well set on the slender  neck&mdash;the well-proportioned figure, neither tall nor short, but looking taller  than its real height from a certain stately way of moving; above all, the  bright, charming manner, so unaffected, yet fully conscious of its own  charm&mdash;there were many that thought&mdash;and as he gazed Charles Craven fully  agreed&mdash;all these things made Cicely Austen far pleasanter to look upon than  many a faultless beauty.</p>
<p>Craven&rsquo;s  eyes followed her, till, the dance being over, she seated herself on a low sofa  at the upper end of the room. Then he suddenly left his place, crossed over,  and addressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Austen, if you are not tired, will you give me the next dance?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cicely  was just beginning a refusal (being engaged for the remaining dances) when she  looked up into the dark face&mdash;it was a dark, determined, plain, almost  disagreeable face&mdash;and a feeling came over her, &ldquo;I should like to dance with  him. I don&rsquo;t know why. I can make it all right with George; he won&rsquo;t mind  missing one dance.&rdquo; Some unaccountable impulse made her shape her words into a  smiling acceptance. She rose, and in a moment they were whirling round to the  music of a rattling galop.</p>
<p>In  spite of his eight-and-forty years, his six feet of height and broad shoulders,  Colonel Craven was a capital dancer, and could make himself very agreeable when  he liked. At first his habitual bitter discontent with things in general tinged  his words; but gradually Cicely&rsquo;s bright manner, the intense happiness showing  in every action, and the impossibility of making her believe he meant the  savage things he was saying&mdash;she took them as jokes, laughing merrily at his  bitterest sarcasm&mdash;so acted upon him that he seemed to shake off the dark cloud  that had settled on him for years, the effects of bitter trouble and  disappointment acting on a strong and violent temper, capable of much good, but  also of much&mdash;ay, fearful evil; and he became, for the time, a pleasanter&mdash;yes,  and a better man. Only every now and then a bitter jest betrayed the hardened  man of the world, disgusted with his share in this life, and caring nothing for  the life beyond.</p>
<p>Cicely,  meanwhile, felt a dreamy fascination stealing over her. A kind of fear, new to  her frank, rather daring nature, took possession of her mind. &ldquo;How different he  is from any one I have met before,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;more like the men one reads  of. He must have led a curious life. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s a good man; but I&rsquo;m  sure he&rsquo;s not so bad as he says; and he seems so unhappy. I wish I knew what  makes him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  were only three more dances before the Beechwood carriage was announced, and  Mr. Austen was in a great fuss to get his party away; but Cicely danced or sat  out these last three dances with Colonel Craven (getting into innumerable  scrapes with would-be partners, only promising to make up for it at another  ball all were going to next week); and as they two traversed the long corridor  to the door where the carriage was waiting, Craven said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many  thanks for the pleasantest evening I have spent for many a day. I have not  danced like this for years: your good spirits must be infectious. I shall go to  the ball next Thursday; no fool like an old fool, you know, Miss Austen.  Good-night.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>After  that first ball Cicely Austen and Colonel Craven met constantly. There were  many dances that summer in Pontham; and constant tennis and dinner parties at  Beechwood Park. Mr. Austen liked his daughters to have plenty of amusement, if  he had no trouble about it; the thought never entered his head how often Craven  and his youngest daughter were together. Young Read, the cousin, being in the  200th regiment it seemed natural to know his brother officers well.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Austen had been dead for years, and the widower&mdash;a thorough country gentleman,  devoted to amateur farming&mdash; never looked after his two remaining daughters (the  eldest had married three years before). Whenever they liked he chaperoned them  to balls, where he and two or three brother magistrates congregated in a  corner, discussing county affairs and experiments in farming, only expecting  his girls to be ready when the carriage was announced, so as not to keep the  horses waiting.</p>
<p>Those  tennis parties at Beechwood, ending with dinner and dancing, were dangerous  things, irresistibly impelling falling in love: not that Colonel Craven ever  took a racket in his hand, but he walked about talking to Cicely most of the  time, trying to persuade her the game was utterly irrational, yet coming day  after day to look on, hardly speaking to any other woman.</p>
<p>We  all know the fascination of a manner cold, almost contemptuous to every one  else, but gentle, tender, protecting to only one. Cicely felt this strongly. He  was never harsh with her. All the world might tell her, as many did, that he  was a bad, dissipated man; that he never went home to barracks till four  o&rsquo;clock in the morning, that he drank, that he gambled; but she felt from the  bottom of her heart that it was only because he had no one to care for&mdash;that he  lived much apart, making real friends with no one&mdash;that she could influence him  as no one else could&mdash;that with her he was different; and as it gradually dawned  upon her that he loved her, she felt with her he would lead a better life;  while for her any life with him would be happiness.</p>
<p>With  all the power of her strong, sensitive nature, with all the affection that had  never been frittered away, or divided among others, she loved him, the only man  she had ever given a thought to, the one she would care for to her dying day.</p>
<p>Alas!  there was no one to warn her. George Read, who might have done it, went on two  months&rsquo; leave almost immediately; one or two of the other officers tried to  hint that there were circumstances in Colonel Craven&rsquo;s life few people knew:  but Cicely drew herself proudly up, refusing to listen; and she was not a girl  men dared speak to against her will.</p>
<p>Craven  never said he loved her, but every word, every action implied it. He never  spoke of marriage, but he showed plainly she was all the world to him.</p>
<p>So  it went on till one day&mdash;how that day remained ever after stamped on Cicely&rsquo;s  mind!&mdash;there was a tennis party at Beechwood. Colonel Craven was not there; he  had gone on three days&rsquo; leave, but was to return the following day, and meet  the Austen party in the evening at a ball. A Captain and Mrs. Chalmers, of the  200th, came to Beechwood that day for the first time. He had only the week  before rejoined his regiment after four months&rsquo; sick leave: consequently the  Austens had only seen them once during a call.</p>
<p>Cicely  never knew whether, having heard some gossip, it was done out of kindness or  mischief, in hope of making a scene, or whether it was sheer accident; but, as  the party was lounging about the drawing-rooms, driven indoors by a shower, Mrs.  Chalmers said to her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a sad thing it is about Colonel Craven and his wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel  Craven and his wife! what did she mean? A stunned feeling came over Cicely; the  room seemed to whirl round; it was only for a moment, then she thought, &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t believe it;&rdquo; and she said gently,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is sad about Colonel Craven and his wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you not know? He has been married twenty years, and is separated from his  wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  it came in full force, she felt it was true&mdash;it must be true; but above all was  the thought, &ldquo;They shall never know he did not tell me; no one shall know.&rdquo; She  nerved herself with a strong effort, though an icy chill crept over her, a mist  was before her eyes, a shadowy feeling of something awful going to happen; but  through all this her face never paled, her voice was steady as ever, and she  smiled as she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes; but I thought you meant something new, not that old story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes,  all through that afternoon, till the guests had departed, Cicely Austen spoke  and moved as before, never faltering, never giving way, till she could go up to  her own room above. Then she realized her sorrow; then locking the door, she  sat upon the floor by the bedside, burying her face, feeling her misery,  feeling&mdash;ah! no words can describe how deeply she had loved, had trusted him;  and he had deceived her, had known all the time that she never could be  anything to him, that it was wrong her loving him as she did.</p>
<p>She  sat there, thinking it over and over again. Had he done it on purpose? He must  have known how she liked him. Did he really care for her? or had he been  amusing himself? She knew it was wrong; but again and again came the thought,  &ldquo;Does he care for me? I never doubted it before; but now&mdash; perhaps he never did,  and yet&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure he did, only the day before yesterday, when he wished me  good-bye. But ah! he knew he had a wife then: why didn&rsquo;t he tell me? If I had  only known at first we might have been such friends! How shall I meet him  to-morrow? I must go, or these people will talk. They will say he has behaved  dishonorably. They have no right to say so. They sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t say I look miserable.  Oh! how I wish I had never talked about him to Helena. She will be so angry  with him. But I felt so happy I could not help it. I wonder what his wife is  like? Does she care for him? She can&rsquo;t, or she would not have left him. Perhaps  she didn&rsquo;t. How confused I am getting: I think I must be going mad! Oh! there  is somebody at the door.&rdquo; Then, as the knock sounded again, she rose, went to  the looking-glass, hastily passed a sponge over her eyes, and opened the door.</p>
<p>Her  sister came in, put her arm round her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,  what are you doing? I am so sorry; I can hardly believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely  laid her head on her shoulder, whispering: &ldquo;Do you think it is true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.  dear; I am afraid it is. I don&rsquo;t see what Mrs. Chalmers said it for if it  wasn&rsquo;t. What a wretch that man must be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  sister instantly raised her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see that. I don&rsquo;t see why he should tell us; a man is not bound to tell  every one. Why should he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  but, Cicely, it was a shame; he did make you like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never made me; it was my own fault. He never said a single word all the  world might not have heard. You know he didn&rsquo;t. I made a goose of myself, but  he could not help that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  did not, my darling. Don&rsquo;t let us talk any more about it. Try and get ready for  dinner. Don&rsquo;t ring for Marian, I&rsquo;ll dress you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  I can&rsquo;t go down to dinner; say I have a headache. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s true; the sun  was so hot. Let me stay here; only, Helena, don&rsquo;t let papa fancy anything;  pray, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, dear. I hear the gong; I must go. You had better go to bed. Try to forget  it, dearest. Don&rsquo;t cry any more.&rdquo; And Miss Austen left the room.</p>
<p>All  the next day Helena tried to persuade her sister not to go to the ball. It was  in vain; Cicely was inexorable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  must go&mdash;indeed I must. You need not be afraid. Do you think I would make a  scene? But&mdash;&rdquo; And her voice sank low. &ldquo;I want to see him just once again. I  can&rsquo;t rest without. I shall be all right afterward; indeed, dear Helena, I  don&rsquo;t mean to go about broken-hearted, or anything of that sort. You know I  don&rsquo;t believe in broken hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  she tried to laugh. Finding argument useless, Helena gave up the point, and  both sisters went with their father.</p>
<p>Cicely  looked very well that night. Her dress, chosen some time before, in  anticipation of this ball, was particularly becoming; only Mr. Austen remarked  something wanting in her face, and asked if she was tired, and the more  observant Helena knew that the bright look of happiness&mdash;the look of vivid,  joyous life &mdash;had gone forever. Ordinary people noticed no difference, and many  thought the youngest Miss Austen the handsomest girl in the room; indeed,  Helena was the one who seemed nervous, trying hard to look unconcerned. She could  not banish a worried expression, and her eyes would follow Cicely with a  painful anxiety not to be avoided.</p>
<p>Colonel  Craven was not there when they arrived. An hour passed before he came. Cicely  was dancing when her sister saw a sort of shiver pass over her face, and,  looking across, she saw his tall figure in the doorway. He came toward her,  shook hands, then turned to talk to Mr. Austen.</p>
<p>How  Helena longed to strike him! She hated to hear his cool, sarcastic tones. A few  moments later Cicely and her partner came near. He stepped forward, and,  bending his head down, whispered, &ldquo;Give me the next,&rdquo; without any other  greeting. She bent her head and passed on.</p>
<p>He  stayed with Mr. Austen till, the music recommencing, she came back into the  ball-room. Then he drew her hand into his, and they began to dance. The smile  that never came but when speaking to her, was on his face, as he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am so glad to get back. How did the tennis go on? You had a showery afternoon;  at least there was rain where I was. I thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  he stopped, looked at her, and said abruptly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  something the matter with you. what is it? Are you tired? Come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  he led the way out of the ball-room, along a passage, to a small room used for  tea in the early part of the evening, but now deserted. He closed the door,  wheeled a low chair to the window for her, drew another close, sat down, and  spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now  tell me all about it. Something has worried you; I know it has. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am only rather tired,&rdquo; she began. Then looking in his face&mdash;she could not help  it (she was savage with herself afterward)&mdash;the tears would come into her eyes,  but she drove them back, giving a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have a headache that makes me stupid and look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  did not let her finish; he got up, clasped her in his arms, and kissed her  passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  darling, my darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  a moment she stayed&mdash;her face crimson, intense happiness in her eyes. Then a  shiver shook her from head to foot, she became deadly pale, and whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  had forgotten. Oh! don&rsquo;t! don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked astonished; then a savage frown contracted his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some  one has told you! Who did? Who dared?&rdquo; Then, seeing her look of fear, &ldquo;Cicely,  my darling, what did they tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be angry. I could not help hearing; besides&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  interrupted her, his tone bitterly sarcastic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  they told you I was married. Don&rsquo;t you congratulate me? Think how delightful to  have had a wife for twenty years &mdash;such a treasure, too. Doesn&rsquo;t some one say  women are angels? By Heaven, my wife was one. Do you know what she did? Left me  before we had been married six months; said I was too great a brute to live  with; told me to my face she only married me to spite some other fellow, who  wouldn&rsquo;t have her&mdash;not such a fool as I was! Now you&rsquo;ve heard it all. I suppose  you&rsquo;ll call me a brute, too. Don&rsquo;t mind telling me: don&rsquo;t you think my wife was  right?&rdquo; </p>
<p>And  his grasp tightened on her hand till he almost crushed the fingers.</p>
<p>Cicely  bent her head till her lips touched his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know I don&rsquo;t; you know I think there never was any one in the world like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cicely,  my own, do you love me! You will stay with me! Oh, you don&rsquo;t know what you are  to me. You won&rsquo;t turn from me because people speak against me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  his voice grew imploring. She raised her face; the large tears standing on her  eyelashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care what any one says: I know it&rsquo;s wrong and wicked; but I will say it&mdash;I  love you, oh, so much. I would kill myself for you just this minute, but,  darling, you must listen to me.&rdquo; She put her arm round his neck, drawing his  face close to hers. &ldquo;We must not do anything wicked; we must never talk like  this again; and, dear&rdquo;&mdash;here her voice sank to a whisper, he could scarcely  hear, close as he was&mdash;&ldquo;perhaps if we bear this well, and try to be good, we may  be happy at last. You know this life is not very long after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  you mean to give me up now, and talk about meeting in Heaven. That&rsquo;s the way  you good people all talk. Do you think there is much chance of my going to  Heaven? Do you call that love? Do you think, if we could change places, I  wouldn&rsquo;t go with you to the end of the world&mdash;to anywhere? Talk about being  friends! do you think I feel like a friend? What do you think will become of  me, if I never see you again? Oh, Cicely, if you want to give me a chance of  going to the Heaven you talk about, stay with me. I would do anything for  you&mdash;go to church&mdash;do anything. You might make me good: won&rsquo;t you try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t, I daren&rsquo;t. My being wicked could not make you good. Don&rsquo;t ask me. It is  so hard to help doing what you say. Don&rsquo;t make it harder; we must part&mdash;we must.  Wish me goodbye, now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  made one more effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you give me up now we shall never see each other again. Remember I shall go to  the bad, and it will be your fault;&rdquo; and his face grew dark and savage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t bear it. You should not say such things; you can&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  voice was cut short by sobs. He changed instantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darling,  I didn&rsquo;t mean it; don&rsquo;t look at me like that. There, I will do what you like. I  will go; only, Cicely, give me one kiss, and say once more you love me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  got up, put both her arms round his neck, kissed him once, a long, lingering  kiss, said, slowly and solemnly, &ldquo;I love you, my darling,&rdquo; then turned round,  putting her face close to the window. There she stood for about five minutes,  neither speaking; then he came to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me take you back to your sister.&rdquo; She put her hand on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  I look as if I had been crying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  said, gravely, &ldquo;No, I think not,&rdquo; and they walked back to the ball-room without  another word.</p>
<p>When  they reached the Austen party Colonel Craven spoke to Helena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have been telling your sister I am afraid I must bid goodbye to Pontham. I have  got my long leave, and start to-morrow. There are a good many things to arrange  to-night, so I must go back to Barracks at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  shook hands with her and Mr. Austen, then turned to Cicely, took her hand for  one instant, whispered, hoarsely, &ldquo;Cicely, good-bye;&rdquo; then walked across the  room and disappeared.</p>
<p>The  Austens stayed about a quarter of an hour longer, Then Miss Austen pleaded a  headache, and they went home.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></h2>
<p>A small  room, divided from one of the principal wards of a London hospital by a movable  partition; an iron bedstead, and on it the form of a tall, powerfully made man,  now helpless, horribly wounded in a street row; one arm broken, a ghastly cut across  the forehead; but, the worst, a fatal injury to the spine; only shown by the  expression of agony on the dark face, and a low moan of pain when no one was  there to hear. He had been found when the fray was ended, by the police,  unconscious, and had been carried to the nearest hospital, where he had lain  for four days, suffering dreadfully, but rarely speaking. Some loose silver, a  cigar case, and three cards bearing the name of &ldquo;Colonel Craven, late of the  200th regiment,&rdquo; were the only things found upon him.</p>
<p>Alas!  who would have recognized the dashing soldier, the well-born gentleman in that  form bearing the marks of low dissipation, a life spent in London&rsquo;s worst  haunts?</p>
<p>Charles  Craven had gone fearfully to the bad since he parted with Cicely Austen. He  left the army, and had lately subsisted by gambling, or languished upon the  small pittance still left him, as the last remnant of his once handsome  fortune.</p>
<p>Seeing  he was a gentleman, the hospital authorities put an account of his accident in  the <em>Times</em>, giving the name, but  hitherto with no result. They paid him every attention, but his case being  hopeless, the surgeons and nurses had too many cases that might be brought  round to do more than see that everything was done to alleviate his sufferings,  and leave him a good deal to himself.</p>
<p>He  had been lying one day for several hours scarcely moving, when, about three  o&rsquo;clock, the door of his room was half opened, and a voice was heard recalling  long past days&mdash;a voice whose low whisper, &ldquo;Let me go by myself, do, please!&rdquo;  sent the blood through every vein in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  can&rsquo;t be; I must be delirious,&rdquo; he thought; but a step advanced, hesitated,  advanced again, and Cicely Austen knelt by the bed, burying her face in her two  hands clasped over his unwounded arm as it lay on the counterpane.</p>
<p>Utter  astonishment, combined with physical weakness, choked Craven&rsquo;s voice. Only a  low moan escaped his lips, and his hand closed tightly over hers; but she  misunderstood him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  could not help it, indeed&mdash;indeed, I could not! I knew it was you. I made papa  bring me. Are you very much hurt, my darling? My darling, do speak! I ought not  to have come, but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  she raised her face, flushed with intense excitement, looking for the first  time full at him.</p>
<p>Slowly,  with a painful effort, every movement a fresh agony, he unclasped his arm, put  it round her, drew her to him till her head touched his shoulder, then, in a  low voice, said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cicely,  my Cicely! then you did care for me? I thought you had forgotten me, darling.  How I bless you for this! I am dying, but this makes death easy. I never  thought to see you again in this world; and we all know where I am going to in  the next&mdash;not much chance of meeting there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  a harsh laugh broke from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!  don&rsquo;t talk like that. You are not going to die. You will get better&mdash;I know you  will. A doctor must be able to cure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  she half rose, as if to call one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  go&mdash;don&rsquo;t call any one; no one can do any good, dear! All the doctors in the  world can&rsquo;t mend a broken back, and mine is broken. Stay with me! Give me one  kiss, darling&mdash;before any one comes, for you never gave me but one in the old  days. Do you remember? Give me another; it can do no harm now. Ah! if I had  only known you years ago&mdash;before&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  now&mdash;even now&mdash;the savage frown that the thought of his wife always brought on  his face convulsed the pallid brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  what&rsquo;s the good of looking back? Talk to me; tell me what you have been doing  since we parted. Don&rsquo;t ask about me; now I see you again, I hate to think of my  life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cicely  must have been there an hour&mdash;to those two it passed like five minutes&mdash;when a  knock came at the door; a moment&rsquo;s pause, and Mr. Austen, with one of the  nurses, entered the room.</p>
<p>There  was an expression of mingled pity and dislike on Mr. Austen&rsquo;s face. Loving his  daughter as he did, he felt a fierce indignation when he remembered how her  life had been wrecked by the man lying there; yet as he gazed, the lifeless  form, the pain-stricken face of that Charles Craven, whom he remembered  standing before him strong, powerful, daringly defying the world to blame or  condemn, above all the look of love for Cicely, melted the ice at the father&rsquo;s  heart. Yes, it was love &mdash;strong, enduring love; few men had behaved worse, few  had brought more misery on the woman they loved; few had more thoroughly  deserved condemnation, yet it was love&mdash;love that had endured through  everything, that would endure to the last moment of the life so fast ebbing  away.</p>
<p>Mr.  Austen felt all this; it came upon him irresistibly. He had always thought  Craven a great villain; he thought so still, but he wondered no longer at his  daughter&rsquo;s affection. He almost forgave him&mdash;almost&mdash;he could not quite forgive,  but pity softened his voice and manner as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to see you like this, Craven. Can nothing be done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing,  thank you. My time is nearly up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven&rsquo;s  voice was low and subdued; how unlike his usual haughty tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Austen, I do not ask you to forgive me, but shake hands with me once, and grant  the last thing I shall ever ask mortal man&mdash;leave Cicely here for half an hour.  I know she cannot stay longer. I have not forgotten&rdquo;&mdash; here the old sarcastic  tone came back&mdash; &ldquo;what the world might say; but it can do no harm; you will be  glad you have done it when you come to be, like me, on your death-bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Austen came to the bedside and took the dying man&rsquo;s hand in both his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God  help you, Craven!&rdquo; and left the room, motioning the nurse to follow.</p>
<p>I  cannot describe that half hour. Before it was ended Cicely looked more like  dying than he did. She spent most of the time persuading, begging him to try  and repent, to be sorry, to ask to be forgiven; and she felt, and will always  feel, that she succeeded; that he did repent, that he was sorry, that God&mdash;the  all-mighty, the all-merciful God&mdash;did forgive him.</p>
<p>At  last, as Mr. Austen&rsquo;s step sounded at the door, one long, long kiss, a whisper,</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  <em>will</em> meet me in Heaven&mdash;you will&mdash;I know you will; God bless you! my darling, my  darling! Good-bye;&rdquo; and Cicely Austen walked slowly but unfalteringly to the  door.</p>
<p>Mr.  Austen drew his daughter&rsquo;s hand in his without a word, led her to the carriage,  without once looking at her pale face.</p>
<p>It  may be very wrong&mdash;very unscriptural, as some people assert&mdash;to pray for the  dead; but there is never a day, hardly an hour, when a prayer for Charles  Craven does not rise to Cicely&rsquo;s lips. And I do not believe she will be judged  amiss for that sin at the great Judgment Day.</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="ForLoveOrGold"></a>For Love Or  Gold</strong></h1>
<p>Turning  over a multitude of papers the other day, I came suddenly upon a bundle of  letters, neatly tied up and evidently arranged with precision. I opened them,  and at the first line I read my memory returned, and I immediately recollected  the whole of the little story they contained. I give it to you now just as it  stands.</p>
<p>Frank  Ripton and I were what is generally termed bosom friends, had been so both at  Eton and Cambridge, where we followed each other systematically, and continued  to be so without any interval of separation, when Providence and our respective  relatives placed us in that station of life in which it was our fate that we  must &ldquo;go.&rdquo; There was very little &ldquo;going&rdquo; on my part, I confess; but Frank was  an artist born and bred, and soon showed signs of rising to the top of <em>his</em> ladder. He chose this line of work  more from taste than from compulsion, as on his father&rsquo;s death he had inherited  some small property, amounting when all was told to about &pound;1,000 per annum, and  as he was making about as much more at his profession was well content with the  life he was leading. I was a barrister, with few briefs and great aspirations,  living discontentedly enough on barely a quarter of my friend&rsquo;s income.</p>
<p>It  was July, warm and sultry, with scarcely a breath of wind to cool the great  London world. All who were worth knowing, so far as money goes, had left their  homes to enjoy cool mountain air and warmly nauseous spas in foreign lands. But  Frank and I toiled on persistently in our London rooms, deaf to the voice of  the charmer: he because his heart was bent on finishing a certain picture  destined to make his name a famous one some months later on, and I because I  could not help it.</p>
<p>While  sitting, then, half baked in my shirt-sleeves one morning, Ripton entered, and  lazily sinking into a chair, informed me that he was &ldquo;Thinking of leaving town  for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you?&rdquo; I answered, with a jealous feeling, born of my own intense but fruitless  desire to quit the great Babylon. &ldquo;And what in the meantime is to become of  your &lsquo;Santa Maria?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  must do without me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I have grown suddenly tired of her. In fact,  spite of all my stoicism, I verily believe that London in the dog-days is more  than I can stand. My clothes don&rsquo;t fit me; my hand shakes as though brandy was  my chief consoler while I hold my brush over the most important part of the  whole picture; I have grown weak and nervous. So as I have the chance, I shall  take myself off to the country for a little time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  your chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  this,&rdquo; he said, and held out to me a letter which I forthwith read. It was from  a Mr. Fontenoy, begging that Mr. Ripton, of whose artistic talent, etc., etc.,  he had heard, would do him the honor to spend some weeks at his house for the  purpose of painting his wife&rsquo;s portrait: he being most desirous to possess the  same, and she being far too great an invalid to undertake a journey to London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  that is what you call resting!&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Why, it is simply undertaking a  different labor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he answered; &ldquo;and for that very reason precisely it suits me down to the  ground. I could not be idle altogether, you know; and here I shall have just  what I require&mdash;good healthy air, a little work, and total absence from my &lsquo;Santa.&rsquo;  Besides, there is a little mystery connected with it that piques my curiosity.  I met Prior in the Park yesterday, and it appears he knows this Fontenoy and  the Grange where he lives well. A charming place, as he describes it, and  charming people, with an only daughter, who is, according to his statement, a  man-hater, a very Timon in petticoats, a woman&rsquo;s-righter for aught I know to  the contrary, and who possesses a fortune of &pound;100,000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,  not content with waiting for Fortune, you are going to take her by storm,&rdquo; I  said dryly. &ldquo;I scarcely expected to hear that. A hundred thousand pounds is a  good thing, but inseparably connected with a man-hater, I should rather fancy  it would be a dear bargain, even if you do succeed in overcoming the young  lady&rsquo;s prejudices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless  and notwithstanding, it is a very interesting sum of money,&rdquo; said my friend, &ldquo;and  not to be despised in this prosaic work-a-day world. However, to ease your  mind, if it should turn out that our modern Miss Kilmansegg squints, or has a  golden leg, or otherwise misconducts herself, I promise to give up the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you will write regularly, and let me know how you are getting on?&rdquo; I asked  eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I promise that also,&rdquo; said Ripton, lazily; &ldquo;so look forward to being done to  death with lovers&rsquo; raptures. Anything else I can do for you? if not&mdash; How  beastly hot this weather is! Got any sherry and seltzer?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;MY  DEAR STEYNE,&mdash;You will be glad to hear I feel better already. It is such a  comfortable thing to know that London, and all its smoke and fog, is far behind  me. I arrived here so late last night that I went to bed without making myself  known to the inhabitants of the household, and consequently slept more soundly,  having had no strange faces to agitate my dreams. When I awoke this morning it  was with the sound of singing birds and rippling streams dancing through my  brain. I rose, tubbed, and looking out beheld&mdash;Fairyland. It was broad daylight,  with the heavy glistening dew still lingering on leaf and grass, while far  before me stretched the park in all the glory of its summer robes. My next  picture I am determined shall be Overton Grange; I never knew a landscape  attract me so much. Whether it is my over-long sojourn in town this year, or my  own overheated imagination, I know not; but certainly it seems to me that never  until now have I thoroughly appreciated country scenery. Next year I shall  bring you down here to this village, whether you wish it or no, and give you  such a surfeit of beauty and fresh breezes as shall suffice to reanimate that  ancient body of thine for years to come.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When  I was dressed, and warned by a solemn gong that breakfast was ready, I went  down-stairs and into the morning-room, where I found my host and hostess, but  not the interesting enemy of all mankind. I was disappointed; my heart died  within me. I had almost given way to despair, thinking that perhaps she had  seen fit to quit the house on hearing of my arrival, when I was partially  revived by a sound outside the door. It was as though a person had sneezed  sonorously. Surely a woman interested in &lsquo;rights&rsquo; would learn to sneeze just so  undisguisedly! The door slowly opened. I glanced toward it cautiously, and  found myself eye to eye with a wheezy-looking butler.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;My  host is a tall, refined-looking man, with iron-gray hair. His wife is a rather  faded specimen of what might once have been termed beauty. Her delicacy  evidently consists of &lsquo;knitting on the brain,&rsquo; she never does anything else; at  least if I am to judge by the persistent manner in which she kept at her  needles all this day, &lsquo;from morn till dewy eve.&rsquo; She has it badly enough, poor  thing! but otherwise looks as healthy as her dearest friends could wish.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As  I have filled as much note-paper as I intended boring you with, I will  conclude. I hope my next will contain some news of the heiress. Until the  receipt of that, believe me ever yours,</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;I  have seen her. They say. &lsquo;See Naples, and die;&rsquo; but I have seen Miss  Fontenoy&mdash;the fairest creature on earth&mdash;and have <em>not</em> died. This is how it all happened. For the past two days, while  sketching in and preparing madam&rsquo;s portrait, it had been a matter of wonder to  me where the heiress could possibly be, and why I had never heard her name  mentioned. Well, this evening, I dressed for dinner, was going along the wide,  open corridor that leads to the broad stone staircase, when something came out  of a room beyond me that riveted my attention on the spot. It was she&mdash;Miss  Fontenoy&mdash;the possessor of unlimited gold and unaccountable dislikes, the object  of my thoughts for the past forty-eight hours. She was dressed in a demi-toilet  of pale azure, and without perceiving me would have gone on her way ignorant of  my anxiety to behold her face, had not a lucky nail (which the gods reward!)  caught in the end of her robe and detained her. I stooped and loosened the hem  of her garment, and then she turned and looked at me. At first I thought &lsquo;What  a sad little face! How solemn! how like a child&rsquo;s!&rsquo; But just then she smiled,  and I at once saw how beautiful she was.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Ripton, I think?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  have guessed correctly, madam,&rsquo; I answered, with a low bow.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  am Margaret Fontenoy,&rsquo; she then said, completing the introduction with pretty,  careless grace; and with a slight but gracious inclination of her small head,  passed out of my sight.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Such  a face, my dear Charlie, and such a fortune, to be joined with such unhappy  prejudices! Eheu! Eheu!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;Sunday,  18th.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;To-day  in church I saw her again. When I arrived&mdash;somewhat late, as is my wont&mdash;she was  sitting in the pew a little beyond her father, and neither raised her eyes nor  took the slightest notice of my coming. Indeed, I believe she was in complete  ignorance of my approach. But during the sermon she partly changed her position  and then for a moment her eyes encountered mine. Such eyes as they are, too: so  large, so dark such a heavenly blue. It seemed to me, looking at her then, that  I had done her but scant justice in my thoughts over-night. When our glances  met, I fancied perhaps she would show some recollection of our former meeting,  some slight confusion, connected with my unusual presence there. But no; her  countenance never altered. She gazed at me fairly for one short minute with the  calm, grave expression that characterizes her face, after which she turned her  thoughts once more to the preacher; and I am certain not for an instant again  during the service did any idea wander, or break loose from holy meditation.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Monday,  19th.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;See  how faithfully I keep to my promise! Scarcely has a day passed without my  writing to let you know of my proceedings. The fact is, old man, that at this  present time you are an <em>unspeakable</em> comfort to me (I give you my honor I did not mean to perpetrate anything so  gross as a pun), and without this lucky correspondence to assist me, I hardly  know how I should get rid of all the various overpowering sensations that have  seized hold upon me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;To-day&mdash;wonder  of wonders&mdash;Miss Fontenoy made her appearance at dinner-time. She wore the same  blue frock in which I had first seen her, while a soft, faint pink rose shone  amid the masses of her dark-brown hair. I had noticed it in the conservatory  about an hour before dinner, and oddly enough had imagined at the time how  charming it would appear in conjunction with her blue eyes. A similar rose, but  rather smaller in size, lay against her neck, at the opening of her bodice. As  she advanced under the wax-lights of the chandelier I could not help thinking  what a very rose of roses she was in herself.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Ripton&mdash;Miss Fontenoy,&rsquo; said her father. And I bowed studiously, feeling all the  time that the days when I had <em>not</em> known her had never been.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  are sure you are not making too free, darling?&rsquo; her mother asked, tenderly,  touching her hand as she passed her, while her father said,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Come  and sit here, Margaret; you will be out of all draughts in this quarter,&rsquo; and  drew a chair near to his own at the foot of the table. &lsquo;Your throat better, eh?  Feel no pain now?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;None,&rsquo;  she said. &lsquo;I think I am quite well again at last, and out of all doctors&rsquo; hands  for the present.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Forever,  I hope,&rsquo; put in her mother, with a sigh that taught me at once how that, even  before the knitting, her mother loves Margaret.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  fear I was rather irrelevant in my replies to Mr. Fontenoy&rsquo;s somewhat heavy remarks  during dinner, my thoughts being distracted all the time by the vision of  Margaret&rsquo;s face opposite to me, and with the knowledge I had acquired as to the  cause of her absence from the family circle during the first part of my stay  here. She has been ill&mdash;extremely ill for a long period, with constant colds,  sore throats, etc., and is only just now recovering. This also accounts for her  excessive pallor at times. I cannot fail to see, by the devotion betrayed in  their manner toward her, what an idol she has become to both her parents.  Indeed, one has but to look at her to know that she is made to be beloved. Ah!  Charlie; were it not for that confounded one hundred thousand pounds, what an  idol she might be to <em>me!</em> Yes; I may  as well confess it&mdash;I am hopelessly, idiotically, miserably in love with this  heiress, this abhorrer of men in general; and would give half I possess&mdash;nay,  all, every farthing I have owned or can own&mdash;to feel myself beloved in return.  But she is so daintily cold, so sweetly repellant in manner, that I cannot  solace myself with even the faintest hope. Why does she so persistently refuse  to converse with me? Why all yesterday after church did she keep so religiously  to her rooms? Why all this evening after dinner did she scarcely deign even to  glance in my direction, and show such distinct disinclination for friendship of  any sort? She is always gentle, obliging, well-bred in every way, but nothing  more. I almost begin to fancy that she dislikes me; that she has taken some  unaccountable ideas connected with me into her head&mdash;ideas that I shall never be  able, through ignorance of their nature, to successfully combat.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When  I had finished my wine, I went into the drawing-room, when I received a cup of  coffee from her hands. Presently, finding that Miss Fontenoy <em>would</em> not speak, and that her mother <em>could</em> not&mdash;being well gone on her journey  toward the Land of Nod&mdash;I began,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;What  a charming flower that is in your hair!&rsquo; I said, in about the same tone as one  should say, &lsquo;What a curious buffalo they have now in the Zoological Gardens!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  said, &lsquo;Yes, the contrast of pink and blue always pleases me. I have a fancy for  the color blue in particular, and I am fonder of this gown than of any other I  have yet possessed. Did you ever feel a sort of attachment for any one article  of dress above another?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  could not remember having ever felt spoony on my clothes, and so I told her.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  laughed.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;It  is only women, I suppose, indulge in such absurdities,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Will you  take some more coffee?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No,  thanks.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Talking  of roses, Mr.Ripton,&rsquo; broke in Mrs. Fontenoy, coming to life most unexpectedly,  &lsquo;did you see that bright yellow in the conservatory? I think it the loveliest I  have ever beheld. Now, to my taste, it would have become you, Margaret, much  more than that faded pink.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think it just a little too glaring?&rsquo; suggested Miss Fontenoy, mildly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Mamma  didn&rsquo;t seem to think so at all. &lsquo;Go and show it to Mr. Ripton,&rsquo; she said,  sleepily; &lsquo;let him decide: artists should be the best judges of coloring.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Would  you <em>care</em> to see it?&rsquo; Miss Fontenoy  asked, half turning toward me with a listlessness of manner by no means  flattering to my self-love. And I said &lsquo;Yes&rsquo; with alacrity, glad of any  opportunity, however ungraciously accorded, that should give me the chance of  becoming more intimately acquainted with her. You may see by this, old friend,  how utterly a victim I have fallen.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  led the way, and I followed her into a warm perfumed atmosphere, where among  many others bloomed the flower in question.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No;  it would not suit you,&rsquo; I said. And indeed the gaudy thing looked sadly out of  countenance when compared with the perfect lily standing before it. &lsquo;You are  too fair. An olive skin would set it off to more advantage.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes;  my face has always been a dead white,&rsquo; she answered, composedly by no means  overpowered by my compliment. &lsquo;Besides, I hate yellow: it is an ugly color, and  there is something unhealthy-looking about it to my mind. Have you ever seen  this double white geranium? See, it is slightly tinged with pink in the center.  A rarity, I am told.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,  I have seen it once or twice,&rsquo; I answered; &lsquo;but I am admiring this myrtle. It  is perfection. Such a pale white in such a dark green sea. Does it not remind  you of a wedding: of what ought to be the happiest of all events?&rsquo; </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  put in this last query, I confess, from absolute curiosity; as from all I had  heard about her from Prior, I was most anxious to hear what answer she would  make.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;It <em>ought</em> to be,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;but how  often is it quite the reverse? How many marriages do we hear of being &ldquo;made  up,&rdquo; without the slightest regard to the feelings of those concerned? How can a  marriage be a happy event with no love on one, or perhaps either side?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  are taking the dark view,&rsquo; I answered. &lsquo;Let us hope few such loveless unions  take place, And&mdash;forgive me&mdash;surely you are very young, and besides can have no  cause to speak so bitterly. At least once, if not oftener, in your life you  must have been beloved?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Far  from taking this rather <em>too</em> outspoken  speech of mine in bad part, she smiled, appeared rather amused for a moment,  during which time she was apparently occupied in conning over what I had said;  then, becoming suddenly grave again, she turned to me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo;  said she; &lsquo;there you have made a mistake. Never in all my life have I been  loved in the sense that you mean. I believe it is only the very unhappy, or&mdash;or  the very poor people who ever get much blessed in that way.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  uttered this extraordinary opinion with the most thoroughly convinced air in  the world,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;How  can you believe anything so monstrous?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Why, at that rate, you lay  down for every rich and happy individual the loneliest and most miserable of  existences. For, without love, what can all the riches in the universe profit a  man?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!  what indeed?&rsquo; she answered, with a sigh. &lsquo;And yet I hold to my first belief;  adversity is necessary to the perfecting of love. Shall we return to the  drawing-room? I always sing for father after dinner, and I see he has just  arrived. If you wish you can come and listen to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Of  course I wished. And she sang some little French songs with exquisite pathos,  and with that utter absence of <em>mauvaise  honte</em> which distinguishes all her actions. Soon after we all broke up and  went to our rooms, where I am writing this to you. Can it be possible she was  in earnest when she said no one has ever loved her? I cannot bring myself to  believe this. I ean see that she is morbidly sensitive on the subject of being  sought for her wealth, not for herself; and it appears she has been  strengthened in this sensitiveness by the conduct of some fellow who proposed  for her about a year ago. Ah! Charlie, could you but see her, you would know  how very lightly her money would weigh in comparison with her own sweet self.  Why has Providence placed such an unattainable treasure in my path?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;August  23d.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;It  appears a year at least, more or less, since last I wrote you a line. But  really so little has happened during the last month to disturb the even tenor  of my way that I scarcely thought it worth while to bore you with an account of  my prosy, every-day life. Mrs. Fontenoy&rsquo;s picture is fairly on the road toward  completion; and it is merely to record an incident that occurred this morning  which will have the effect of detaining me here much longer than I originally  intended, that I write at all. Last night I went to bed with the full certainty  of seeing you face to face in a week at the furthest; now I cannot well say <em>when</em> I shall have that pleasure. Well,  to return to my incident.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Sitting  in my studio to-day, at about one o&rsquo;clock, with Madame Fontenoy opposite to me,  I was thinking deeply of anything but the subject in hand, when a faint  rustling at the end of the room disturbed my meditations. I looked up, and  perceived Miss Fontenoy standing in the doorway. Such a lovely picture as she  made, framed in by the gilded <em>portail</em>,  dressed in some soft white floating drapery, with just a suspicion of  rose-color somewhere, but whether in her hair or under her chin, or fastened in  her waistband, I cannot tell, so entranced was I by the beauty of her face.  Never, I think, had I seen her look so charming&mdash;her complexion, as usual, very  pale, her lips deep rose and slightly parted, her blue eyes large and black in  the shadow where she stood.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mother,&rsquo;  she said, &lsquo;I want to have my portrait painted.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;My  dear!&rsquo; exclaimed her mother, evidently startled by this unlooked-for whim.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  want, to have my portrait painted,&rsquo; reiterated Miss Fontenoy very distinctly,  &lsquo;to hang it beside yours. Father says I may have it done, if I wish; and, if  Mr. Ripton will be kind enough to paint me&mdash;&rsquo; this last with a questioning  glance in my direction.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Of  course, darling, of course,&rsquo; said mamma, willingly</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;My  picture is almost finished, and when it is, you can speak to Mr. Ripton about  it yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Can</em> you spare me the time?&rsquo; she asked,  fixing her soft, clear eyes on me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.  I will give you my time,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;<em>gladly</em>.&rsquo;  As I pronounced the last word with emphasis, I fancied (was it <em>only</em> fancy, I wonder?) that she blushed  the very faintest blush conceivable.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank  you,&rsquo; she said, simply, and left the room,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;During  all these past five weeks she has taken so little notice of me that this sudden  determination on her part to have her beautiful face painted by my hand has  almost unsettled my reason. I have asked myself, over and over again, what it  can mean? but can come to no satisfactory conclusion on the matter. Is it  merely girlish vanity, or a certain curiosity to see her own eyes look back at  her out of the crowd of faces that adorn the picture gallery? or can it be&mdash; Ah!  Steyne, I dare not finish that sentence. Were I to give myself hope now, might  I not end in the direst despair? So cold she is, so far away&mdash;my pale, fair  Margaret.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note">&ldquo;September  2d.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;For  two whole days she has been my model. And now, listen. About two hours ago she  came to give me her usual sitting, and came alone. The first day, madame la  mere, acting in the character of chaperon, I presume, appeared on the scene;  but to-day Margaret came all by her own sweet self. When I had worked  assiduously for about ten minutes, during which time no word had been spoken by  either of us, she suddenly broke the silence.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;What  a bad thing it is to be rich,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;What  a bad thing it is to be poor, you mean,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No&mdash;<em>rich</em>. I believe it would be better for  every man and woman in the world to be born without money. For a man, because  he should make his own way without having it carved out for him. For a woman,  because&mdash;because then she would be quite sure of being loved for herself alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Might  not a rich woman be loved for herself alone?&rsquo; I asked. (&lsquo;Lower your chin  slightly. Thanks.&rsquo;)</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No;  it is <em>almost</em> impossible. See here, I  will give you an example. Take myself, for instance. I have, as you doubtless  have heard, &pound;100,000; and never in my life have I had a real lover, No one has  ever spoken to me as I feel sure they speak to other luckier women who possess  nothing in the world but their own sufficient attractions.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>How</em> do they speak to those other luckier  women?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo;  she said, gravely, with a sort of intense wistfulness that somehow made my  heart beat with an uncomfortable rapidity, &lsquo;I will be frank with you. When men  have proposed for me&mdash;and I tell you without vanity (nay, rather, indeed, with  shame) that many have done so&mdash;they never address me in any way but as &ldquo;Miss  Fontenoy, I hardly presume,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Miss Fontenoy, having spoken to your father  on a subject very dear to me,&rdquo; etc., instead of saying &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; or &ldquo;dearest,&rdquo;  or, perhaps, &ldquo;<em>darling</em>,&rdquo; as I have read  in novels that they generally do.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;All  this she said earnestly, and with such true <em>naivete</em> and innocence of expression, that I was touched to the heart.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;You  should not place too much reliance on novels,&rdquo; I said &ldquo;They are written to suit  the public mind. Real life is widely different at times. A man might love you  very dearly, and still shrink from addressing you in a manner so familiar. Will  you forgive me if I speak plainly to you, Miss Fontenoy, and tell you that I  think you let your thoughts dwell too much on the fact of your being an heiress?  It makes you unjust both to yourself and the rest of the world.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Perhaps  so,&rsquo; she answered, sadly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;And  out of all those you mention as having&mdash;admired you,&rsquo; I began, as indifferently  as I well could, &lsquo;was there no one among them you liked above the others? Were  you equally hard-hearted to all? (Raise your eyes a little, please: that will do.)  Was there not one for whom&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Not  one!&rsquo; she said, decisively, and then there was a pause.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  acknowledge to you, Charlie, that at that moment I had no more idea what I was  doing than you had, sitting so many miles away in your chambers. I could not  even have sworn (if put to it suddenly) whose face was growing before me on the  canvas.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Presently  Miss Fontenoy began again:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Were  you really serious about what you said a moment ago?&rsquo; she asked me, earnestly. &lsquo;Do  you believe it possible for a man thoroughly in love to address the object of  his affection in such measured language as I have described.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Men  differ,&rsquo; I said. Then, very slowly&mdash;&lsquo;but to put a case before you: if I were the  man in question, and you were the woman, I should simply say, &ldquo;<em>I love you</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!  exactly so,&rsquo; she murmured, quietly, and sighed, and turned away her head toward  the open window. Had she looked in my eyes they would, without doubt, have  betrayed me; but, as it was, the tone of my voice conveyed no impression of the  truth to her mind. I had played a trump card&mdash;one of my very best; would it  stand to me?</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  withdrew her gaze slowly from the outer world, and once more placed it upon me;  and as she did so she faltered, became first crimson, then deadly pale, and  finally, rising hastily, walked over to the window. When, a minute later, she  came back to her first position, it seemed to me there lingered on her long,  dark lashes faint traces of recent tears.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  think I will sit no longer to-day,&rsquo; she said, quietly. &lsquo;I feel tired. You will  excuse me? or, rather, be glad to get rid of me, as I fear I can give you  neither the required expression nor passiveness to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Say  rather you feel tired of me and of my company,&rsquo; I said, bitterly. I felt at the  moment hopeless&mdash;despairing.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Shall  I say what would be an untruth?&rsquo; she asked, reproachfully. &lsquo;Surely you would  not wish that. I am tired neither of you nor of your society, only&mdash;of myself.  It is possible to be bored even by one&rsquo;s self at times. I must go, and walk the  feeling far away from me. Good-bye for the present,&rsquo; and she held out her hand  as she spoke.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  became savagely rude on the spot. I would not see the little hand of kindness  placed just within mv reach. I turned away, and began busying myself among my  miserable paints.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Will</em> you not say &ldquo;good-bye&rdquo; to me?&rsquo; she  said, softly, and laid her hand on mine.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The  touch was more than I could bear.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Margaret,  Margaret!&rsquo; I cried, passionately, and caught her suddenly to my breast. I had  never dreamed how small, how fragile a creature she was until I had her in my  arms. She seemed to melt within my tender embrace, to grow slighter each moment  I held her to my heart. At that moment I was utterly, inexpressibly happy, and  even when I awoke to a sense of what I had done, I assure you, Steyne, it was  neither a feeling of fear nor shame that possessed me. On the contrary a  sensation of intense gladness stole over me. Surely, I thought, this  irresistible outburst of mine will convince her more than all the words that  could be spoken how irrevocably my heart and mind and being are wrapped up in  her</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;When  she withdrew herself from my arms, she appeared neither displeased nor  frightened&mdash;only a little surprised, and very, very pale.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Why  have you done this? she asked me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Because  I love you,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Do</em> you love me?&rsquo; she said, gazing  intently at me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.  Have you not seen it, Margaret? Must you ask me that question, being uncertain  of my reply? Surely your own heart must have told you long before this that you  are all the world to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;She  made no answer to this, but lowered her head a little, and left her hand in  mine.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  do not speak,&rsquo; I went on, gently, encouraged by the fact of her little fingers  lying passive, warm, and close within my clasp, no effort being used to  withdraw them.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;What  shall I say?&rsquo; she murmured.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Say  that you love me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  have not thought of this,&rsquo; she said, earnestly. &lsquo;The idea is new to me. I must  have time to think&mdash;and you also.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Time!&rsquo;  I interrupted, impatiently. &lsquo;I want none. From the time of our first meeting in  the corridor (you remember it) I knew my heart was yours, I can only tell you  in months, in years, nay, in all time to come, what I have told you now&mdash;I love  you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless,  I can give you no answer until three weeks have gone by,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;And do not  think this capricious or unkind, because&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Here  the door opened, and Mr. Fontenoy&rsquo;s face appeared on the scene. Naturally he  looked rather put out and disconcerted, not to say indignant, at the <em>tableau</em> before him, Miss Fontenoy and I  standing hand in hand, indulging in what must have appeared to an uninitiated  beholder a decidedly &lsquo;stormy debate.&rsquo; Margaret came bravely to the rescue.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Papa,&rsquo;  she said, &lsquo;this gentleman has just told me that he loves me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo;  said papa.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Just  so,&rsquo; continued Miss Fontenoy a little nervously: &lsquo;and I have just told him that  I can give him no answer until I have heard your wishes, and until three weeks  have gone over my head. But, in the meantime, you remember, papa, don&rsquo;t you,  the promise you once made me, never to interfere with any arrangement that  might lead to my happiness?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,  Margaret,&rsquo; returned her father, gravely; &lsquo;always provided it <em>did</em> tend toward your happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Thank  you, dear father,&rsquo; she said, and went over to him and kissed him in her own  sweet little way.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There  were tears in his eyes when next he looked at me.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&rsquo;  he said, &lsquo;you will do me the honor to spare me an hour in my study this  evening.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  bowed acquiescence, and he, having returned my salute with grave courtesy, went  out of the room.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Will  you not repent, Margaret?&rsquo; I asked, reproachfully, when we were once more  alone. &lsquo;Will you not make it <em>one </em>week&mdash;seven  long days&mdash;instead of your first determination? Remember how many weary hours  they will contain.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;petulantly;  &lsquo;I have said. Three weeks, no more, no less. Be content. Look back on this day  last month, and see how short a time it appears to be.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,  then,&rsquo; I said, with a sigh, &lsquo;I suppose I must rest&mdash; <em>dis</em>-satisfied.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo;  she replied.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Good-bye,&rsquo;  repeated I, and detained her hand. &lsquo;You will kiss me?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No&rsquo;&mdash;very  decidedly&mdash;&lsquo;<em>certainly</em> not.&rsquo; Then,  repenting, seeing how her manner saddened me&mdash;&lsquo;At least, not <em>yet.&rsquo;</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;September,  8th.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Nothing  new to communicate, beyond the fact that Margaret and I see less and less of  each other every day. This is all of her own contriving. My interview with her  father passed off better than could have been expected; but had I not been as  sincerely and faithfully in love with Margaret as I am, I could scarcely have  brought myself to demand an heiress of her father in the cool manner I did. He  received me kindly, but formally; and, after half an hour&rsquo;s conversation,  admitted my right to bestow my heart when and where it best pleased me. This  was at least something gained; and, on the strength of it, I gathered all my  remaining powers of persuasion together, and as the marble clock on the  mantelpiece chimed the full hour, I rose triumphantly, with free permission  from Mr. Fontenoy to win and wed his daughter, always provided that young lady  is willing to be won. At times I scarcely know what to think: she seldom now  appears in the mornings, and frequently, when we meet during the day, I can see  a disposition on her part to avoid me. Today, however, she honored us with her  sweet presence at breakfast hour, coming into the room quietly as usual, and  kissing her mother in silence. She is at times capricious. For instance, when  passing me, she reserved the gentle smile she is in the habit of bestowing on  me, and merely placed the tips of her dainty fingers in my hand by way of  compromise.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;What  will you take?&rsquo; I asked her when she was seated, alluding to the numerous  dishes on the table before her.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing,  thank you,&rsquo; she said, briefly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing!&rsquo;  reiterated her mother, concernedly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,  then, a very little toast, please,&rsquo; she said apostrophizing me; and, having  taken it, proceeded to play with it abstractedly.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  felt sure her mind was ill at ease. Mr. Fontenoy began to look unhappy, as he  always does when anything&mdash;no matter how small&mdash;goes wrong with his darling.  Seeing which, she made an effort worthy of the Dombeys, and swallowed half the  allowance I had given her.</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;&ldquo;Dear  me, Margaret!&rsquo; bleated Mamma Fontenoy, &lsquo;it seems to me that every day you only  eat less and less.&rsquo; At which complaint Miss Fontenoy laughed a little nervous  laugh, and made some jesting remark about gourmonds, the meaning; of which I  did not catch. I was lost in thought, preoccupied, watching the pretty fragile  fingers trifling with the breakfast before her, when the arrival of the post  aroused me from my day-dreams.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No  letter for you, Margaret,&rsquo; said her father. So she rose from her seat, and went  over to the window.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;There  is little ceremony here, and each one reads his or her letters on the spot. I  opened yours, and found the account of the &lsquo;bursting up&rsquo; of that mining company  (which, by the bye, will be no joke to our friend Jack Wilmot). I had heard Mr.  Fontenoy speak of this venture some days before; so I said,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;The  Smoleshire Lead Mine Company has gone to smash.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;&ldquo;Eh!  What?&rsquo; said Mr. Fontenoy. I repeated my intelligence. &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; said he, as  though thunderstruck, and then glanced meaningly at his wife.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  always <em>did</em> say those mining companies  were unsafe,&rsquo; she declared, with placid admiration of her own superior  judgment, and drew a long knitting-needle out of her work with a cautious  flourish.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Meanwhile  I was looking at Margaret. She had left off drawing designs on the damp  window-panes, and was turned toward us. There was a startled expression on her  face, which presently gave place to one of thoughtfulness, while a glance as of  sudden inspiration lit her eyes. She glanced at me earnestly for a moment.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Is  it very bad, papa?&rsquo; she asked, alluding to I knew not what. And he said,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Very  bad, indeed, I am afraid.&rsquo; Whereupon she instantly quitted the room.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Now  having put all this together, I have formed an idea. It is this. That probably,  in this precious mining company, some &mdash;a great deal&mdash;perhaps the whole of her  fortune has been invested, and is now lost to her forever. Oh! if it might be  so: if all were indeed gone, how much more thankfully, hopefully, could I look  forward to the end of this seemingly eternal three weeks. How thoroughly could  I then convince her of the depth and sincerity of my affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;September.  13th.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Well,  it is all over. And now attend to the last account in my small drama. This  morning nobody appeared at the breakfast-table except myself and Mr. Fontenoy.  My host steadily maintaining all through this unsociable meal a countenance at  once severe, uneasy, and miserable, I concluded that somehow or other he had  got out of his bed at the wrong side. I had very little time for conclusions,  however, as the instant he had finished his repast he rose from his chair and  said, gravely,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;May  I beg, Mr. Ripton, that you will meet me in the library at twelve o&rsquo;clock  to-day?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  said, &lsquo;certainly,&rsquo; with as much coolness as I could command. After which he  immediately went his way.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Left  to myself, all sorts of wild conjectures thronged through my brain. A second  interview&mdash;and <em>Mr</em>. Ripton&mdash;(Frank had  been my designation for the week past)&mdash;what could be the matter? Something cold  as ice fell heavily upon my heart. I could not think; I could imagine no just  cause for this line of conduct on the part of Mr. Fontenoy. Not even the  faintest idea of what might possibly be going to happen came to enlighten my  puzzled mind! Though all around me seemed to be written in letters of fire the  one word &lsquo;Margaret.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;At  twelve o&rsquo;clock to the minute I was at the library door. Opening it I found  myself in the presence of Mr., Mrs., and Miss Fontenoy. He&mdash;the father&mdash;was  seated at the center table, the same uneasy, unsettled expression in his face;  while his wife lounged near him in an arm-chair, serene as usual, the everlasting  knitting between her fingers. And Margaret&mdash;she stood at some distance from  them, so deep in the shadow of the heavy window-curtains that it was almost  impossible to mark the changes of her features from where I stood. It was a  somber day, as you may have noticed, but a bright fire burning in the grate  took away from the appearance of gloom that pervaded the out-of doors  landscape. Margaret was standing&mdash;oddly enough, I thought at the time&mdash;with her  hands clasped on the back of a velvet chair. The covering of the chair was  bright crimson, and so the fair white hands and pink nails came out in bold  relief on the top of it.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Pray,  sit down, Mr. Ripton,&rsquo; said my host, in a rather embarrassed tone.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  sat down.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;He  cleared his throat, ominously for <em>me</em>,  I began to think, when be spoke again.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  must beg you to remember,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;before I commence, that no binding  engagement existed at any time between you and my daughter&mdash;Miss Fontenoy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;It  is all up with me.&rsquo; thought I.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Mr.  Fontenoy,&rsquo; I began, despairingly, and with a quick glance in the direction of  the window-curtains, when he interrupted me peremptorily with a quick wave of  his hand.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  will please allow me to finish what I have to say without comment of any kind,&rsquo;  he said, hurriedly. &lsquo;I will not keep you long.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Here  he took a pinch of snuff. I felt I was going mad.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;About  a week ago,&rsquo; he went on, &lsquo;you received a letter from a friend of yours, I  think, in which was contained the news of the smash of the Smoleshire Lead Mine  Company. Well, sir, in that most iniquitous transaction my daughter&rsquo;s entire  fortune has been made away with.&rsquo; A dead pause. &lsquo;And so we think it only right  to tell you, that even had there been any engagement (which there was not)  between you and my daughter you are now released from it, and perfectly free.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;<em>Free!</em>&rsquo; I cried, passionately. &lsquo;<em>Free!</em> What a word to use! Nay, rather,  bound forever to unspeakable misery if you cast me off now. Ah! sir, perhaps  you think&mdash;her own fortune being now a thing of the past&mdash;that my income is not  sufficient to make her as happy and comfortable as she is here. But you are  mistaken. I will work. I will conquer all difficulties. I am rising in my  profession, and before next year may, perhaps, have doubled what I am at  present in the habit of making, if you will only trust her to me, if&mdash;if she  will only trust herself.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;As  I finished this disjointed speech, I looked appealingly toward Margaret&rsquo;s  hiding-place, but she uttered no word of encouragement, only I could see the  pink nails were no longer pink, they were snow white from the intensity with  which she clasped the chair on which she leaned.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;You  misunderstand me, sir,&rsquo; said her father; and I noticed how strangely shaken and  husky his voice was as he spoke. &lsquo;You misunderstand me completely. You have my  full consent to marry my daughter if she wishes it, but remember&rsquo; &mdash; he stopped  here and then went on slowly and impressively&mdash; &lsquo;if you take her you take a wife  without one penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  am taking my heart&rsquo;s love, if she will only come to me,&rsquo; I answered.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And  she <em>did</em> come to me. Out of the shadow  she came, my darling; her beautiful face pale, but with a light in her soft  eyes that all the Old-world painting could never have produced. It was the  light of love and happy satisfied content. She came and put her arms around my  neck.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Kiss  me,&rdquo; she said. And then with a long sigh: &lsquo;I am so happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Of  course, in spite of father and mother, I kissed her three times right heartily,  and out of the utter gladness of my heart.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;After  a moment she withdrew herself from my arms, and placing her hands very demurely  in mine said:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;And  now forgive me.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  asked, &lsquo;For what?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Because  I have deceived you,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;Because I have not lost my money at all.  Because I have behaved disgracefully.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  stared at her in amazement, and then looked to her father to give me a proper  explanation of her words. </p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;The  fact is, Frank,&rsquo; he began, rather shamefacedly, when his daughter interrupted  him.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;No,  papa, I will tell him,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;But first,&rsquo; turning to me, &lsquo;you are not angry  with me? Say you are not.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Of  course I said so; as equally of course I should have said the same had she done  all the world to injure me, with those wonderful eyes looking imploringly into  mine.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!  well then,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;it was not distrust of you, remember. It was not want  of love. It was only that I might satisfy myself how well you cared for me for  my own sake alone. And when you told us that morning of how the mining company  had failed in which Uncle John, father&rsquo;s brother, had invested (and has lost a  great deal of money), it occurred to me that here was a good opportunity of  testing the depth of your affection for me. So I persuaded papa to tell you the  little fib he told you just now, and which you believed, and which has quite  convinced me of your love, and made me happy. Are you angry now? Will you  forgive me now?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;I  laughed. I could not help it. I felt I ought to be dignified, and justly  indignant, but I could not.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,  I <em>am</em> angry now,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and I  won&rsquo;t forgive you unless you confess you are sorry for what you have done.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;How  can I,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;when I am not? Had I not committed this crime I should  never have known how unhappy it would make you to lose me. I found <em>that</em> out by the expression in your eyes  when father said something about our engagement coming to an end.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Forgive  me, Frank,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Fontenoy at this moment, &lsquo;and believe me when I say  that never for one instant did I entertain any doubts of your sincerity. But  this child has made me so entirely her slave ever since her birth that I know  not now how to refuse her anything,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Here  Madam Fontenoy rose to the occasion. She got up from her chair, and coming to  my side presented a fair though withered cheek for my salute. I saluted her.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;My  dear Frank,&rsquo; she said, with a sigh of satisfaction, &lsquo;I cannot say how really  glad I am that Margaret has chosen you, and not one of those horrid military  men. Ever since she has been a little girl I have been haunted with a  presentiment that some one or other would come and carry her off to India or  some such odious, uncivilized clime, And now at last my mind is set at rest.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Having  finished this little speech, which she evidently had been getting up for my  edification, with consummate skill, while seated in the arm-chair, she, with a  true touch of womanliness, put her hand upon her husband&rsquo;s arm and led him out  of the room.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Of  course when left alone, the first thing we did was to kiss each other again.  Then Margaret said,</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Are  you happy?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Perfectly.  Entirely. <em>More</em> than happy, my  darling!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Have  you nothing left to wish for?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Nothing.  I am utterly content. Is it the same with you?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.  Just the very same,&rsquo; she answered.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Margaret,&rsquo;  I said, &lsquo;do you know that up to this you have never yet said, &ldquo;I love you?&rdquo; &rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Have  I not? I suppose because I saw no necessity to say in formal words what must be  written in my eyes! Well, I will say it now: I love you.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;At  this sweet assurance, so sweetly given, what could I do but kiss the giver of  it again?</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Another  thing,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;Have you forgotten that those three miserable weeks have not  expired, and yet you have told me your love is mine, and you have kissed me  already?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah!  not <em>yet </em>gone by!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;To  me it has seemed a <em>long</em>, <em>long</em> month!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;And  to me a year; but yet it is not. And so, you have broken your word, oh, most  inconsistent of damsels!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;Well,  I will make up for it&rsquo;&mdash;archly&mdash;&lsquo;and I will let <em>six</em> weeks pass from this hour before I even smile upon you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;&lsquo;I  hope we shall be married before that,&rsquo; I answered; whereupon ensued a somewhat  lengthy discussion, the perusal of which I will spare you.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;And  that is all. We are to be married in three months; and you, of course, will be  my best man. However, I will give no more details in this, as I intend seeing  you shortly face to face, having to run up to town in a day or so to arrange  some few matters, and give a glance at my neglected picture. My pearl of pearls  is leaning over my shoulder as I write these last words, and desires her love  to my <em>Fidus Achates</em>.</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;Ever  yours,&mdash;F. R.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>And  that was all: except that the marriage was solemnized some three months later  with all the <em>eclat</em> that could be  given to it by a bishop and two other clergymen, and eight bride-maids, and a  very giant among wedding-cakes. I was best man, and supported my principal with  the entire assiduity of which I was capable. So that, altogether, the whole  thing passed off as well as such melancholy occasions are generally expected  to.</p>
<p>I  spent last month with the Riptons, and was so thoroughly impressed during my  visit with the serenity of married life, that I have <em>almost</em> made up my mind to offer my hand and heart to the bridemaid  with the hazel eyes&mdash;with whose beauty my whole being has been saturated ever  since that eventful wedding. Such is the force of good example.</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="OutOfTheDepths"></a>Out Of The  Depths</strong></h1>
<p>We  were a merry party, gathered together one bright winter&rsquo;s morning round the  breakfast-table at Everton Grange.</p>
<p>A  long, low, wainscoted room, with deep, bay-windows looking out on a smooth,  velvety lawn which sloped gradually away to, and was bounded by, a splendid  avenue of chestnuts leading to the lodge gates.</p>
<p>Although  the trees had lost their foliage and the ground was covered with hoar-frost,  everything looked cheerful and comfortable and redolent of genuine old English  hospitality, from the fat robin, now a mass of fluff and feathers, who was  lazily perched outside on the deep ledge of the window, having regaled himself  sufficiently on his daily meal of bread-crumbs, to the interior of the room,  the fire blazing in the wide, old-fashioned grate, before which the old  house-dog stretched himself, and occasionally summoned up sufficient energy to  rub his nose with his fore paw; while my aunt&rsquo;s bright face beamed on all as  she poured out the tea and at times joined in our lively chatter.</p>
<p>We  were, I remember, busily discussing the arrival of certain guests, who were  expected in the course of the following fortnight to visit the Grange, and the  conversation turned on a subject which then appeared trivial enough. Who was to  occupy the &ldquo;Red Room?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put <em>me</em> there. Aunt Eleanor,&rdquo; I said; &ldquo;no  one has a better right to my old play-room than I have myself; and you know I  was never afraid of bogies or ghosts, witches or warlocks; so it is not likely  I shall begin now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My  uncle looked up from his paper and gave me an approving smile as I said these  words. I knew he held in great contempt all foolish fears regarding the world  of spirits; but Aunt Eleanor, I thought, seemed rather grave; and she hesitated  for a moment before she answered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Nellie dear, like you, I am no believer in&mdash;or at any rate I have no dread of  ghosts; and when I first came here I often slept in that room without being  frightened or having my rest disturbed by supernatural visitors. People in  former times have complained, and the servants, as you know, are always talking  about it, so I have never liked to offer the room to any visitor. Indeed, it is  some years since we have had the house so full as to require it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well  now, auntie, the case is altered. I really wish to sleep there, and we shall be  such a large party. You will absolutely want my present apartment for some old  dowager or other; so let me have my own way, and I will try at any rate to  exist in the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;s quarters.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  well, dear,&rdquo; said my aunt; &ldquo;it shall be as you wish;&rsquo; and she added, laughing,  as she rose to leave the room. &ldquo;For the present, at any rate, you may consider  yourself mistress of the &lsquo;ghost&rsquo;s domain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie,  how can you be so foolish?&rdquo; said my cousin Edith, as soon as the door had  closed on her mother and the younger children, and Sir John having gone to  attend to some magesterial business in the neighboring town, we found ourselves  left to our own devices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never say much before mamma,&rdquo; continued Edith, &ldquo;because she only laughs and  tells me not to be superstitious; but do give up the idea of going to that  horrid part of the house, and share my room instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Edith,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;my mind is quite made up; besides, I have now a  character for bravery to uphold; and to tell you the truth, the spirit of  adventure has so completely seized upon me that I actually feel quite a longing  to take possession of my new abode.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My  cousin used every endeavor to persuade me to give up my purpose, but in vain. I  listened, it is true, to all her arguments, but being very young,  high-spirited, and, I fear, rather willful, I was determined to show myself no  coward by sleeping in the haunted room.</p>
<p>Before  I proceed further with my story I suppose I ought to give my readers a glance  at my <em>dramatis personae</em>.</p>
<p>First,  as to myself, Eleanor, or, as I was usually called, &ldquo;Nellie&rdquo; Charteris. I can  hardly imagine now that I am the same Nellie Charteris&mdash;the light-hearted, merry  girl of more than forty years ago.</p>
<p>It  seems rather as if I was writing the history of a dear friend, of one long  since dead. And, indeed, such is the case; the Nellie Charteris of those days <em>is</em> dead&mdash;has been dead many, many years;  and it is but the shadow of that bright face, but the faded resemblance of  those laughing hazel eyes I now see when I look in the glass and wonder to  myself, &ldquo;Did the events I am now about to relate ever really happen to me, and  can it be possible for one person to live as it were a <em>double</em> life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My  mother died when I was but a child, leaving no other children, and from the  time I left school I kept house for my father, who was a barrister. When he  went on circuit, or was obliged for any other reason to leave home, I used to  go and stay with my aunt and her husband at their house in Berkshire.</p>
<p>My  dear aunt Eleanor had been a mother to me in all but name ever since I could  remember. She was my father&rsquo;s youngest sister, and remained in our house after  my mother&rsquo;s death until Sir John Austen took her away to make another home as  bright and happy as she had made ours.</p>
<p>It  was a week after Christmas-day when I received a summons from her to join a  party of cousins who were all going to the Grange for some Christmas  festivities.</p>
<p>I  was going to my second home. The weather was real Christmas weather. There were  dances and other amusements without end in prospect, and better than all,  Charlie was to be there! I ought to have said before that Charlie was the one I  loved better than all the world, better even than my own dear father; for  Charlie Carruthers and I were engaged, and were to be married in about a year&rsquo;s  time.</p>
<p>I  was not quite twenty years of age, and he was a few years older, and a  lieutenant on board H. M. S. Hecla.</p>
<p>Charlie  had gone to spend a week with his father and mother in Scotland, and was to  join us at Everton Grange.</p>
<p>One  bright morning, therefore, my father and I left London on our way to Berkshire.  It was very, very cold, but the clear, piercing air only sent the young blood  dancing more merrily through my veins, until I felt I must sing for very joy,  and I was almost sorry when our journey drew to a close, and, driving up the  chestnut avenue, we saw the lights in the Grange windows, sparkling like  myriads of fire-flies, through the winter twilight.</p>
<p>It  was such a dear, cozy old house, partly built in the better years of Charles  the Second&rsquo;s reign, but added to, spoiled, and improved by successive  generations of the Austen family. It was built of gray stone, and was long and  low, with mullioned windows and solid-looking chimneys.</p>
<p>My  uncle always kept both house and grounds in perfect order, which prevented that  dreary &ldquo;moated grange&rdquo; look so many old places acquire if they are at all left  out of repair. One wing alone could be said to look at all ghostly, and this  wing contained the so-called &ldquo;haunted,&rdquo; or Red Room. It was in fact the oldest  part of the building, and its faded, time-stained walls had witnessed the  births and deaths of many generations of the Austen family. It was used as my  play-room when as a child I came to spend part of my holidays at the Grange,  and my toys, I remember, were always kept in a certain deep closet near the  old-fashioned fireplace. And oh! with what glee I used to rush up the stairs to  my favorite room, and still more favorite closet, and commence overhauling my  treasures, especially examining my dolls, to see that they were all in good  health, and had been well cared for during my absence.</p>
<p>I  made little histories and romances for myself out of my dolls and other toys;  in fact, I loved them with the love of an imaginative child who, from being  brought up with no brothers or sisters, and few companions of her own age, had  made a little world for herself among her wooden playmates. My baby cousins I  felt were far less clever than my dolls, and a certain Miss Elizabeth, a doll  who occupied the highest shelf in my cupboard, and who rejoiced in a broken  nose and various other defects, I believe I considered far superior to the  whole of the human race.</p>
<p>From  these familiar associations the room lost all its terrors for me, and though I  constantly heard the servants talking about the &ldquo;ghost,&rdquo; and though none of  them with the exception of the old nurse would venture near it after sundown, I  did not mind going there at all hours; and, as my aunt and uncle very wisely  took (or at any rate pretended to take) no heed of the superstition, I very  soon began to look upon the Red Room very much in the same light as I did any  other part of the house.</p>
<p>I  made nurse Alison tell me its history one night about a year previous to the  commencement of this story, when I was paying my usual visit to the Grange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Miss Nellie,&rdquo; began the old woman, as I sat on a low stool at her feet by the  fire in the children&rsquo;s nursery, &ldquo;now the little ones are gone to bed, I don&rsquo;t  mind telling you all I know about it. Sir John and my lady don&rsquo;t like it  mentioned before them, as it makes them &lsquo;timorsome&rsquo;-like after dark. My  grandmother, she used often to tell the tale how Sir Robert Austen brought home  a young wife from &lsquo;foreign parts.&rsquo; She remembered seeing them when she was a  child. He was a middle-aged man, she said, with lines across his brow, and dark  bushy eyebrows, which he had a way of knitting together while he was speaking.  She, poor lady, was a delicate-looking little fairy-like thing, barely your  age, my dear, when he first brought her here. Everything went smooth enough at  first; but he was a moody, ill-tempered man, jealous of everything she set eyes  on. Her mother forced the poor soul to marry Sir Robert, I&rsquo;ve been told, and  she had already given her heart away to some young Italian nobleman. Anyhow,  Sir Robert led her an awful life, and after her boy was born she had just pined  away like a shadow. Then one night (they had some words together, I believe,  not long before) she tried to escape through the little glass door which led  into the garden. Some said the young Italian lord was to meet her, and they had  planned to go away together. Anyhow, Sir Robert&mdash;who every one thought was away  from home&mdash;it seems, had his suspicions, for he followed, and stopped her just  as she was going down the pathway by the waterfall that leads to the park. The  servants heard the sound of a struggle, and a dull, heavy noise like a blow;  and when they came running to see what had happened, they found my lady lying  on the bed in the Red Room, looking so white and death-like, and her husband  kneeling beside her, chafing her hands. He only said their mistress had had a  fall; and they saw by his face they dared ask no more questions. She never  spoke a word of sense again, poor dear, but was quite mad till the day of her  death, which happened a year or two later. In that room she was kept, and up  and down she used to walk, whispering to herself sometimes in English, but  oftener in Italian, and looking over her shoulder from time to time in a  sudden, scared way, as if some one was following her; then she would walk a  great deal quicker, until at last her strength gave way, and she would sleep  from sheer exhaustion. There she remained, and there she ended her sad life.  Then Sir Robert left England and never returned. His little son was brought up  by his guardians until news came of his father&rsquo;s death, and he became heir to  the property. Ah, my dear, that blow killed the poor lady: anyhow, it destroyed  her reason, and after her death, people said whoever slept in that room had a  warning before they died, or before the death of any one they cared for. I  don&rsquo;t know what they saw, but footsteps were often heard, I&rsquo;ve been told,  though I can&rsquo;t say I was ever frightened by anything myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So  Nurse Alison finished her story; which certainly made some impression on me,  and gave me a sort of eerie sensation for a time, and as I passed the Red Room  during the next week or two I confess to feeling a dread of looking behind me,  and of rather quickening my steps, as I thought of poor, pale Beatrice Austen  and her young, sad life ended in such a fearful manner. Still, as I said before,  the poor old room had been so familiar to me in my childish days that I soon  again got the better of my terrors, and&mdash;to return to the commencement of this  story&mdash;I had become so completely indifferent to all the horror of nurse&rsquo;s  legend that, as I have already said, I was the first to propose myself as an  occupant of the ghost&rsquo;s domains, when Christmas time brought us all once more  together at Everton Grange. I felt no fear, no dread of evil. My happiness, I  suppose, helped to throw a glamour over everything: in fact, I was very young,  and very much in love. We had many happy parties during those few short  weeks&mdash;weeks so full of perfect bliss&mdash;and the Red Room at night looked cheerful  and unghostly enough with a bright fire and candles lighting up its old  red-painted walls and faded hangings, while a group of merry girls&mdash;myself the  merriest of the party&mdash;chattered and laughed in orthodox girlish fashion, as we  discussed the pleasure of the preceding days, and formed plans and made  arrangements for other pleasures in the future.</p>
<p>We  used to have such dances, too, and the rafters of the old Grange would ring  with the tread of many feet and the laughter of many voices. Then, better than  all, were the quiet talks Charlie and I often had together; especially during  that precious hour, the hour before the dinner-bell rang, when we generally  contrived to meet in my aunt&rsquo;s little sitting-room. There, free from fear of  all intruders, we would build such dazzling &ldquo;castles in the air,&rdquo; and arrange  such plans for the future, for those happy days in store for us which we had  promised to share together.</p>
<p>I  can see him now, my own dear love, the one figure standing out so bright and  clear among the misty shades&mdash;getting dimmer now as the years go on&mdash;of those I  knew and loved at that happy time.</p>
<p>I  can see him&mdash;oh, so plainly!&mdash;standing by my chair in Aunt Eleanor&rsquo;s little room;  his handsome head, with its short, wavy curls, looking golden in the flashes of  the firelight as he bends toward me, while I listen with a full heart to his  glowing words, as he pictures our happiness in the years that are to come.</p>
<p>He  was so good, so brave and true; far too good for me, I often thought: and then  I would wonder what he saw in me to make him love me so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is but a plain face,&rdquo; I used to say to myself at times when I looked in the  glass; but then Charlie did not think me plain, so what did I care?</p>
<p>And  so the days wore on, until the time was at last fixed for the breaking up of  our party, and for our return to town.</p>
<p>I  know my heart sank within me when I said good-bye to the friends and relations  with whom I had spent so many happy hours; and when the last morning actually  came, and I looked with a loving fondness round my dear old room, whose red  walls and queer corners had become so dear to me, and were so filled with happy  memories, I felt so completely and so unaccountably miserable that I had to  take myself seriously to task for what I then considered morbid feelings.</p>
<p>We  were all sitting round the breakfast-table on that morning, the last we were to  spend at the Grange, for at any rate another twelvemonth, when Charlie entered.  I, who knew so well every expression of his face, saw by the deep, dark look of  his blue eyes, and the nervous contraction of his lips, as he tried to smile  and make some apology for being so late, that something had happened.</p>
<p>However,  he took his accustomed place next to me, and talked and laughed apparently in  his usual manner until breakfast was over; then he drew me into Aunt Eleanor&rsquo;s  sitting-room, our dear old trysting-place, and throwing his arms round me, and  straining me with passionate force to his heart, he said, in a voice so husky I  hardly recognized it,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nellie,  my own darling, you must be brave: the Hecla has orders to sail immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  could not speak, my heart was too full: so I only put my head on his shoulder  and sobbed, while he kissed me and soothed me as a mother does her child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  will only be a short voyage, darling,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;and then I shall be with  you again, and we shall never more be separated, for you will be my own, my  dear little wife,&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  tried to cheer up and to be brave, but it was no use; the idea of losing him  even for a year or six months&mdash;to know he was far away where I could not go to  him&mdash;seemed to me more than I could bear, and in spite of my earnest endeavors  the tears would come, and even <em>his</em> voice seemed to have lost the power to rouse me from the feeling of despair  which made my heart turn cold within me. Charlie himself was completely  overcome at last, and then, womanlike, I became the consoler; and when our  carriage came to the door, and I felt inactivity to be no longer endurable, we  were both more resigned and more hopeful as regarded the future than either of  us had thought possible when the sad news first struck our hearts like the  dismal toll of some funeral bell.</p>
<p>I  was glad we had to travel on that day&mdash;glad to have to be busy, to be moving. I  felt quietly sitting still would be an impossibility. I could not even think.  Those words &ldquo;the Hecla has orders to sail.&rdquo; seemed to deaden everything else,  and to render every other idea a blank. Charlie was to go with us as far as  London, and afterward to join his ship at the port whence she was to sail.</p>
<p>I  cannot describe our parting: though it is now so many years ago, it is the one  event in my life I dare not dwell upon. </p>
<p>He  went, and I saw the vessel gradually recede from my sight, as I stood with my  father on the pier, and watched the cold mists of an early February morning  gather round the departing ship like a thick white shroud, and hide the huge  masts and spars from my aching eyes. Then my father took me home.</p>
<p>And  so I lived on in the old daily routine of life; living as so many others have  to do, as if I were in a dream, and devouring with eager haste all the shipping  news, to see whether the Hecla was mentioned. My patience was at length  rewarded, and when I at last heard of its safe arrival, and then when the long-expected  letter from Charlie made its appearance, I felt as if the whole world was now  nothing to me, and my heart went up in gratitude to God for having preserved  him.</p>
<p>I  paid a visit to the Grange again during the summer after Charlie&rsquo;s departure,  and again occupied the Red Room. It was called my room now, and even the  servants had got to look upon it with far less awe than formerly. I had, in  fact, broken the spell.</p>
<p>When  I left I promised to repeat my visit at Christmas. But ah! how different that  Christmas gathering would appear to the last!</p>
<p>News  had arrived in the spring that the Hecla was not to return to England until the  following year, in November or December: nearly eighteen long weary months  before I could see my darling. &ldquo;Will the time never go by?&rdquo; I used to cry in my  impatience; as if my longing and wearying could make the hands of Time&rsquo;s great  clock move faster. My only comfort was in my dear one&rsquo;s letters, which were  always with me, and which I literally knew by heart.</p>
<p>Summer  waned into autumn, autumn to winter; then to spring and summer again, and the  joyful news came at last.</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s  ship might be expected about the end of December; so, early in the month, I  went to spend a fortnight at the Grange, intending to return to town a week  before the Hecla was due. I had been there about a week, and was counting the  days in a state of feverish happiness as they passed slowly but surely by, and  the period of my happiness grew nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>It  was my birthday, I remember, and in a day or two after I was to leave town. We  had a merry party gathered together to celebrate the event, and many were the  presents I received, and many were the good wishes showered upon me that  evening as they all drunk my health at supper in the old dining-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  Nellie dear,&rdquo; said Uncle Austen, &ldquo;we must make the most of you now, for it is  the last Christmas you will spend as Miss Charteris, so we had better say  good-bye to you now forever, in that character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How  often since then have I recalled those words&mdash;words said in jest, but which were  to become so fraught with terrible meaning!</p>
<p>At  any rate they were true words: the Nellie Charteris of that night they indeed  said good-bye to forever.</p>
<p>My  aunt followed me up-stairs, as was her custom, in order that we might have one  of our usual conversations before retiring for the night.</p>
<p>We  talked longer that night than we had ever done before. I had so much to tell of  my future plans and the hopes I expected so soon to see fulfilled,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  comfortable it all looks,&rdquo; she remarked, as at length she rose from her chair.  &ldquo;You have certainly &lsquo;laid the ghost,&rsquo; Nellie dear, and we ought to be much  obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  we wished each other good night, and she left the room.. After the door had  closed upon my aunt, I still sat dreamily gazing into the fire. My spirits  appeared suddenly to sink, and I felt strangely cold, as if I had just heard  some terrible news. I tried to rouse myself by walking up and down the room. I  even laughed, and tried to hum a tune to shake off, as I hoped, my  unaccountable nervous feelings; but it was no good. My laughter sounded forced  and unnatural, and the song I suddenly recognized as one Charlie was always  whistling the last time we were together, and somehow that made me even more  dismal. Then I took out his letters and read them one by one&mdash;those dear letters  which never before failed to give me comfort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall soon see him; he will be here in less than a fortnight,&rdquo; I kept on  repeating to myself. But somehow the sense of the words did not seem to enter  my brain.</p>
<p>Then  I arose and went to the window. I drew aside the heavy crimson curtains, and  looked out.</p>
<p>The  moon was just at the full, and the ground sparkled with snow, while the trees  stretched their gaunt, snow-laden branches toward the sky, like frozen  skeletons in some wild German legend.</p>
<p>All  the earth looked so calm and still, bathed in the soft veil of moonlight; and  yet my heart was throbbing against my breast, and I alone felt out of harmony  with nature, and without peace.</p>
<p>I  waited, heedless of the cold, until I heard the bell of the little village  church strike the quarter to twelve, the chimes vibrating in the calm, still  air.</p>
<p>Then  those happy Christmas words: &ldquo;Glory be to God on high; and on earth, peace to  men of good-will,&rdquo; came into my heart with the chime of the bells, and I turned  from the window, and kneeling beside my bed, prayed earnestly&mdash;more earnestly  even than usual&mdash;for the safety of the one I loved best on earth.</p>
<p>I  lay awake some time, watching the firelight flickering on the walls, and  lingering more especially, it appeared to me, on my dear mother&rsquo;s picture,  which hung opposite my bed. Her sweet eyes seemed to smile at me as I fell  asleep.</p>
<p>How  long I remained so I have no idea; but I was awakened by what appeared to me to  be footsteps passing through my room, and the feeling as if some one were  stooping over me. Closer and yet closer, and then a cold breath passed across  my face, and I distinctly heard my name murmured, and then a quick, low,  gasping sigh.</p>
<p>Surely  it was Charlie&rsquo;s voice!</p>
<p>My  heart stood still; but I sat up in bed and listened, and again I heard that  voice calling me, but the tones were lower and more indistinct. I was not  dreaming.</p>
<p>Once  more my name was uttered in a stifled whisper, as of some one struggling for  breath, so close that it seemed in my very ear, and then&mdash;all was still.</p>
<p>Oh  God! those awful moments, never to be forgotten! I tried to call out, but could  not; to pray, but my tongue was unable to form the words. Again I struggled to  cry out with all my strength, and then, I suppose, I fainted.</p>
<p>Watson,  my aunt&rsquo;s maid, was beside me when I recovered, bathing my forehead with eau de  cologne, and trying to revive me by every means in her power. &ldquo;Miss Nellie  dear,&rdquo; she said, as soon as I was able to understand her, &ldquo;why did not you tell  me you were ill before? I heard you walking across the room about half an hour  ago; but as I thought you were only sitting up later than usual, I did not come  to you until I heard you scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  I knew it was no fancy of mine. Watson had also heard the footsteps. A film  seemed to close over my eyes, and again I fainted.</p>
<p>Shall  I ever forget that dismal morning, or, indeed, the weeks that followed?&mdash;weeks  of silent misery and the bitter anguish of suspense. Reason with myself as I  would, I felt convinced something had happened, some terrible misfortune was  impending. My dear father, my uncle and aunt Austen, all tried to persuade me  it was only a dream. I knew better, and I refused to be comforted.</p>
<p>Earnestly  I prayed to have strength and grace given me to bear whatever trial was in  store for me. And those prayers did strengthen my heart; for when the news came  at length, and they told me the Hecla had gone down, and all her crew had  perished, in sight of land, on the very night of my supposed dream, the  bitterness of death for me had passed, and I never shed a tear.</p>
<p>My  heart was withered within me. I only prayed God to let me die; to let me go to  him whose last thoughts had been for me, whose last breath I knew had gasped my  name.</p>
<p>But  God, in His mercy knew best. He let me live; live, I hope, to be less selfish,  less wrapped up in human love, than I had been before.</p>
<p>And  so now I am waiting for another meeting, which, unlike the last, I know is sure  to come. Then &ldquo;out of the depths&rdquo; of this world&rsquo;s troubles my spirit will go to  join him I love so well, where there is no parting; where &ldquo;the weary are at  rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  mother, I never thought to see you take so much trouble for a lodger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.  Mertoun is no common lodger, Prissy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Ray. &ldquo;I was famous for getting  up fine linen in my youth; and when the gentleman asked me if I could send for  Mrs. Bali to do him up a few things in a hurry, &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll just try  my hand at them myself,&rsquo; as it was only once in a way. You don&rsquo;t often see a  whiter shirt than <em>that</em>,&rdquo; added the  worthy woman, with pardonable pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  but, mother,&rdquo; urged Prissy, &ldquo;I remember you were vexed when Mrs. Lloyd bid me  ask you if you would take the Hall washing; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  is quite different, Prissy,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Ray, rather sharply. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m nobody&rsquo;s  laundress, nor going to be! As I have told you before, the Rays were once  gentlefolks, so your father said when he asked me to marry him. He said he  could take no common woman, and I felt I could take no common man, so, though  we were cousins, we got married, and we never had cause to rue it, either: but  I was going to say Mr. Mertoun seems to know that we&rsquo;re above the common sort;  and he respects us too. &lsquo;Mrs. Ray,&rsquo; he said to me yesterday, &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t hear  of <em>you</em> slaving yourself over the  wash-tub,&rsquo; or something like that. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to work for a gentleman like  him, Prissy, so it is. Then he gives no trouble, and finds no fault; and he  never has any one with him except his brother, Mr. Rupert&mdash;a nice, lively young  gentleman; and he takes such pains with the garden too. Hush! here be comes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Priscilla  Ray looked up with some curiosity to see the new inmate, who had taken up his  abode in her father&rsquo;s house during her absence. The Reverend Laurence Mertoun  had been recently appointed to the curacy of Everbury, and had chosen Farmer  Ray&rsquo;s house as the nearest to the parish church where lodgings could be  obtained.</p>
<p>On  passing the open kitchen door, Laurence exchanged a courteous &lsquo;Good-evening&rsquo;  with his landlady, and perceiving a second woman, concluded it must be the  delicate daughter who was expected home for a change of air, as Mrs. Ray had  informed him in the morning. Dull man that he was, he did not observe that she  was a singularly pretty girl, really of a refined style of beauty; unlike the  ideal farm-house maiden with her full rosy cheeks and plump, rounded figure.  Prissy, however, had made an accurate surrey of the curate as he passed the  door, and commented favorably on his appearance to her mother as soon as he was  supposed to be out of ear-shot. Indeed, the Reverend Laurence Mertoun&rsquo;s many  perfections, moral and personal, formed the chief topic of conversation at  Malby Farm that evening.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  the unconscious subject of these praises sat busily employed in his little  study up-stairs. Sometimes, indeed, he varied the monotony of his writing by  turning to the window and watching the effect of the glorious sunset on the  beautiful landscape outside. Then, having refreshed himself, he bent again over  the pile of papers on the table before him; ever and anon referring to some  ponderous-looking volumes at his side, and copying out deeply scored passages  selected as bearing upon his subject.</p>
<p>Everbury  was a small place, and the majority of its inhabitants were illiterate. A  quarter of Laurence Mertoun&rsquo;s time sufficed for his ministerial work, and the  remainder was devoted to literature. He was now engaged upon a &ldquo;History of  Western Creeds,&rdquo; a book projected in his college days, and now in a fair way  toward completion.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>Prissy  Ray had a lover; indeed, report said she had had her choice among all the young  men of Everbury; but the favored one was a keeper on the estate of Sir Baldwin  Blantyre, at Comerford. His name was Rolf Benson, and he was in every way  considered a suitable match for the pretty Prissy. His father was a substantial  farmer in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>Prissy  was a romantic damsel, and well read in sensation literature of a certain  class. One story which she had read of German Jagers (Jaggers she called them)  had taken her fancy particularly. The hero of this tale was called Rolf; and  Prissy&rsquo;s cousin and particular friend always held that Rolf Benson partly owed  his success with the village beauty to his very peculiar and un-English name.  True, this name was easily accounted for. It was merely an alteration of the  name Ralph, by which he had been baptized. In some districts the <em>l</em> is always sounded in the latter name.</p>
<p>Whatever  cause may be assigned for the remarkable fact, Prissy had been constant to Rolf  for a whole year, notwithstanding the admiration she called forth in the large  town of Grayminster, whither she had been sent to learn sewing-machine work and  dressmaking, and where close confinement had threatened materially to injure  her health.</p>
<p>Fresh  air and country living did much to restore the languid beauty. She was soon  able to bear her part in household business, and to resume some of her out-door  pursuits. By the time she had been six weeks at home, her languor was a thing  of the past, and except for a certain refinement in face and figure, no one  could tell that her health had ever given way.</p>
<p>Before  these six weeks were over, Laurence Mertoun had in all Everbury no more ardent  admirer than pretty Prissy Ray. She regarded him with a sort of veneration as a  being of a higher order. Her esteem, too, found vent in various substantial  benefits. A steady table with a commodious drawer appeared suddenly in his  room. His stiff arm-chair, suggestive of penance, was mysteriously furnished  with cushions. His room was continually kept supplied with sweet, fresh  flowers; whereas hitherto his sole floral decoration had consisted of a bouquet  every Saturday, which sometimes being left untouched for a week, was  consequently more conducive to discomfort than pleasure. Best of all, however,  while Laurence&rsquo;s study was systematically &ldquo;tidied,&rdquo; his papers were always left  untouched. Laurence, though by no means observant, was sensible of various  little improvements in his circumstances, but if he bestowed a thought upon the  agent, it was to the effect that little Ruth, the maid-of-all-work, was  superior to most farm servants. The idea of Miss Ray, with her coquettishly  bashful glances, long eyelashes, and creamy complexion, concerning herself  practically with his affairs never entered his mind.</p>
<p>One  evening, six or seven weeks after Prissy&rsquo;s return, Laurence stood moodily at  his window. His room, as usual, was covered with a student&rsquo;s litter. Some point  had arisen with regard to &ldquo;Western Creeds&rdquo; which puzzled him excessively. The  difficulty had haunted him while writing his sermon, and now that that duty was  ended, and he was at liberty for research again, perplexities seemed to  increase upon him, At last, impatiently pushing his books aside, he turned for  a moment to admire the lovely landscape, looking fresher and greener than usual  from the effects of a passing shower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  rain&rsquo;s over; it&rsquo;s going to be fine,&rdquo; a voice was saying below. Watching for the  speaker, Laurence saw Rolf Benson coming out, carrying a shawl over his arm. A  moment afterward Prissy joined him. There was some half-whispered conversation,  and. a little giggling, until finally Prissy took Rolf&rsquo;s arm, and they walked  away together, looking back now and then to nod to some one in the doorway  below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  that&rsquo;s the way the land lies, Mr. Rolf, is it?&rdquo; said Laurence to himself. &ldquo;That  accounts for my meeting that young man about here so constantly of late. Well,  they are a fine young couple, and I hope they may be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By  this time the lovers were out of sight, and the curate returned to his lonely  work with a sigh.</p>
<p>Poor  Laurence! His own love-affairs had not prospered, and he regarded himself as a  soured man. Those who knew his history best believed that he had little reason  to trust in the truth and fidelity of woman.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;You  can knead the cakes, Prissy; the oven will be heated against I come home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy,  like a dutiful daughter, set to work immediately. She established herself at  the table near the window, perhaps that she might smell the honeysuckles which  peeped in through the casement; or perhaps that she might see Mr. Mertoun go  out. She saw a more uncommon sight, however, in the arrival of visitors, a lady  and gentleman on horseback, attended by a mounted groom.</p>
<p>Prissy  knew the strangers well by appearance. They were a son and daughter of Sir  Baldwin Blantyre, of Comerford Hall, the owner of the greater portion of  Everbury parish. The Blantyre family generally spent two or three months each  year at the Hall; and as the country was rather destitute of gentry, young  Lewis Blantyre had heard with great pleasure that his old schoolfellow,  Laurence Mertoun, was established at Everbury. The young ladies, too, were glad  to hear of an addition to their country circle of gentlemen acquaintances. They  had met Laurence occasionally in his college days; and now soon after the  arrival of the family, Lewis had ridden down to call on his old friend.</p>
<p>Miss  Ethel remained discreetly outside, in charge of the groom, and Prissy, deeming  herself unseen, had taken an exact inventory of the lady&rsquo;s riding-dress, and  had mentally made some rather uncomplimentary remarks upon her appearance,  before the young men came down-stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss  Blantyre,&rsquo; Laurence began, &ldquo;I am really very sorry, but I had no idea you were  waiting out here all this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you, Mr. Mertoun,&rdquo; replied Ethel; &ldquo;I have been quite entertained admiring  your beautiful scenery. I never thought the Hall was such a lovely place as it  looks among the trees yonder. I have also been lost in admiration of the pretty  bakeress inside that trellised window; isn&rsquo;t she quite a picture, Lewis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>None  of this was overheard by Prissy, fortunately for her vanity. The guests were  just about to depart when Lewis Blantyre said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  the bye, Ethel, Mertoun has a specimen of &lsquo;Lady Lorton&rsquo; in full blow, much  better, I say, than Dunscombe&rsquo;s, that got the prize at the Show&mdash;at least,  judging from the blossom. Could you show us the plant, Mertoun? My sister is as  great &nbsp;a flower-fancier as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly;  that is, if Miss Blantyre would care to come into the garden.&rdquo; The plant is in  my little hot-bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy  saw Mr. Mertoun help Ethel to dismount, and directly afterward the group passed  the window. It occurred to the farmer&rsquo;s daughter that as far as appearance was  concerned Miss Blantyre would have done better had she remained on horseback.  There is about as much difference between a woman mounted in her habit and  walking in the same dress as there is between a swan on land and a swan on the  river. Ethel Blantyre, indeed, was no beauty at the best of times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  provoking!&rdquo; said Laurence. &ldquo;The padlock is on the garden gate. Wait a minute. I  must go back to the house for it. Mrs. Ray,&rdquo; he said, looking into the kitchen,  &ldquo;can you let us into the garden, please? The gate is fastened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Ray, however, was not present, and Prissy turned from her work to speak to him.  For the first time in his life Laurence was struck with her rare beauty, as,  missing the key from its accustomed nail, she ran out to get it from her father  in the stable. &ldquo;Ah, here comes the beauty,&rdquo; said Ethel to her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did  you ever see&mdash; She is not a bit like a farm-house girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  was distressed by the look of bold, unrestrained admiration which young  Blantyre cast upon Prissy, as with a little courtesy she came forward to open  the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a real beauty of a &lsquo;Lady Lorton&rsquo; so it is!&rdquo; cried Ethel, bending over the pale  pink geranium, the fashionable flower of the season. &ldquo;<em>So</em> rightly named, too, after the dear little woman! No, now, Mr.  Mertoun,&rdquo; she added, as she saw Laurence taking out his penknife, &ldquo;you  positively mustn&rsquo;t behead her ladyship for me&mdash;and then, perhaps, preach on  that&mdash;what is it?&mdash;Nathan&rsquo;s parable next Sunday! I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s quite capable of  it; isn&rsquo;t he, Lewis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  are plenty of buds,&rdquo; said Laurence, rather coldly, for he greatly disliked a  light allusion to his sacred office. As he spoke he cut the fullest blown  cluster with a leaf, and presented them to Miss Blantyre. She held them in her  hand, admiring them for a minute or two, and then drew them through a  buttonhole in her habit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunscombe  will lose his night&rsquo;s rest when he sees this,&rdquo; said she, tapping the pale  blossom. &ldquo;I must refer him to you, Mr. Mertoun, for some hints on gardening. I  hope you are disengaged on Friday,&rdquo; she continued, as Laurence helped her to  remount.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,  I have accepted Lady Blantyre&rsquo;s kind invitation,&rdquo; replied he, opening the gate  for them to ride out.</p>
<p>The  visitors were gone, Ethel rather lamenting to her brother that so clever a man  as the curate seemed to be should be buried in an out-of-the-way corner of the  world like Everbury. Lewis seemed rather sulky, and made no response. At last  his annoyance found vent in words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a starched prig that fellow Mertoun is! He sees a chap looking at a pretty  girl, and he scowls like a thundercloud! Why, everybody can&rsquo;t be as owlish as  himself.&rdquo; Laurence, meanwhile, had returned to his study, and was working with  redoubled diligence to make up for lost time lost this morning with his guests,  and to be lost on Friday at the dinner-party. He <em>was</em> certainly growing rather &ldquo;owlish&rdquo; in his solitude. If he  bestowed a thought upon the nineteenth century at all, it took the form of a  wish that no one might again disturb him at the study of the Eddas, in which he  was becoming much interested.</p>
<p>And  Prissy went back to her kneading, with a brief glance at the mirror, just to  convince herself that after all a short pink jacket, neatly made with half  sleeves, just displaying the elbow, was not a very unbecoming dress to a dark-eyed  lassie with round white arms. I have met possessors of handsome faces who could  look in the glass without seeming conscious that beauty was reflected there;  but Prissy was not one of these rare exceptions to the general rule; she was  fully alive to the fact of her beauty, and well aware of the influence it gave  her. When she had finished her household work, she took her sewing out under  the great elm-tree in front of the house, and there she sat persistently for  two hours or more until Mr. Mertoun came out; and when he passed with some  civil remark about the weather, she wondered to herself whether he thought her  prettier than Miss Ethel Blantyre.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></h2>
<p>It  seemed as if the Fates were against &ldquo;Western Creeds&rdquo; that week. On the day  following the Blantyres&rsquo; visit, Laurence was congratulating himself on wet  weather, which seemed likely to secure him an undisturbed forenoon, when a  light step was heard on the stairs, and a young man carrying a dripping  waterproof coat looked into the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha!  old bookworm, busy as ever. Not afraid of a damp stranger, I hope. You look as  if you hadn&rsquo;t stirred from that desk these three months. Didn&rsquo;t expect to see me,  eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Rupert,  old fellow, this is an unexpected pleasure. Why, I thought your regiment&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quartered  at Gray minster, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; replied the younger brother. &ldquo;I shall be just as  troublesome to you as I was in the spring, popping in on you on all occasions.  Though it was such a downpour of a morning, I took advantage of the first spare  minute to run down and see how you were getting on. I didn&rsquo;t write; I thought  to surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  so you did, most agreeably,&rdquo; replied Laurence, &ldquo;especially to-day, for if the  roads are passable at all, I have a long walk before me after dinner, and shall  be very glad of company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At  &lsquo;Western Creeds&rsquo; still, I suppose?&rdquo; said Rupert, glancing over the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  it is a great task, and still far from finished. However, I have taken up some  more immediately lucrative literary work lately, in writing for magazines. And  now that I have got into the way of it, you would be surprised how well it  pays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Writing  for magazines, eh? Poetry, Philosophy, Fiction, Theology?&mdash;what is your  particular branch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theology,  chiefly; but I have lately tried fiction. I was rather amused yesterday when  looking over the first chapters of my tale in the &lsquo;<em>Grayminster Monthly</em>&rsquo; (a new publication in whose success I am  interested), to think that some years ago I should have considered it unclerical  to read such an effusion, much less to write it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  we get enlarged ideas as we grow older,&rdquo; replied Rupert, sententiously. &ldquo;You  used to have queer, cramped notions on other subjects besides that; but just  proceed instantly to hand me the <em>Grayminster  Monthly</em> until I give you my invaluable opinion upon the production. Then I  won&rsquo;t disturb you, as I see you are busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Western  Creeds&rsquo; may have a holiday for to-day,&rdquo; said Laurence, replacing his papers in  the drawer. &ldquo;I have just one or two letters that must be written, but they will  not keep me long. Now that you have arrived, Rupert, added he, &ldquo;I hope you can  stay, for I dine to-morrow at Comerford; and I am sure the Blantyres will be  delighted to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t,  thank you,&rdquo; replied Rupert. &ldquo;I have my return ticket, and must go by the night  train. However, I am glad those people are at home, to give you a little  society in this &lsquo;up country&rsquo; settlement of yours. I hope you make yourself very  agreeable to the young ladies, Laurence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  winced. It was not a subject on which he approved of jesting. Rupert, however,  not being quick to take a hint, went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,  my dear boy, you ought to think seriously of matrimony. One of the Blantyre  girls, I am sure, would suit you nicely, and they have heaps of money too. Look  at the advantage you have here&mdash;a clear field and no rivals. Surely you are not  going to make a hermit of yourself because Helen&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<em>Please</em>, Rupert, say no more on the  subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  words were entreating, the tone was commanding. Rupert was silenced at once,  and spoke no more until Laurence introduced some indifferent topic.</p>
<p>The  unexpected arrival of Mr. Rupert created considerable excitement down-stairs,  though Prissy, having taken a side glance at the young ensign as he took off  his coat in the hall, concluded that he was nothing to compare to &ldquo;our&rdquo; Mr.  Mertoun.</p>
<p>Laurence  and his brother sat together after dinner, discussing the events of the three  months which had elapsed since they had met, when Prissy knocked at the door  with a dish of fresh raspberries which she had just gathered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother  thought, sir, you might like&mdash;&rdquo; she began, hesitatingly, for she was not in the  habit of acting waiting-maid to the curate: indeed, she had never before been  in his little dining-room while he was there.</p>
<p>Laurence,  perceiving her embarrassment, stood up, and took the dish from her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you, Miss Ray. How very kind and thoughtful! Please tell Mrs. Ray my  brother and I are much obliged. I am only sorry you had the trouble of coming  up. &rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scene  from &lsquo;Quentin Durward,&rsquo; I declare,&rdquo; said Rupert, as Laurence returned to the  table. &ldquo;Is that the style of beauties you have in this part of the world,  Laurence? Where did she come from? I never saw her before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is the daughter of the owner of the house, and was absent from home until  lately,&rdquo; replied Laurence, rather coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  wonder, indeed, you don&rsquo;t admire the Miss Blantyres or any of our fashionable  belles, if <em>that&rsquo;s</em> the style of thing  you see every day! How cross you look for nothing, Laurence! I think your  temper is getting spoiled by your hermit life, and you are turning into a very  St. Kevin. I declare,&rdquo; continued Rupert, changing his tone, as he rose and went  to the window, &ldquo;the rain is over, and there&rsquo;s Jacqueline herself out gathering  flowers or cabbages or something. I think I&rsquo;ll follow the example of a certain  industrious insect recommended as a pattern to young England by an eminent  divine and poet, and &lsquo;improve each shining hour&rsquo; by cultivating the  acquaintance of the fair creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rupert,&rdquo;  said Laurence, gravely, &ldquo;listen to me. I will have no nonsense carried on here  while I can prevent it. Miss Ray is a most estimable young woman, a  Sunday-school teacher, a member of the choir, and I have a very high opinion of  her. She is, moreover, engaged to be married to one of the worthiest young men  in the parish. She is extremely pretty&mdash;dangerously so, I think; and I believe  she is quite aware of the fact. Girls are often very silly and conceited, and I  do not know what nonsense you might put into her head, or what misery you might  bring about, if you were to go down and idle away half an hour now by talking  flattery and nonsense to her. You know you are always welcome in any home of  mine; but if I find you inclined to take any liberties with my landlady&rsquo;s  daughter, I must ask you to discontinue your visits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  think I wanted to take away the girl&rsquo;s character,&rdquo; muttered Rupert, sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  at all. I know you to be incapable of anything of the sort. Still, you are  aware that &lsquo;evil is wrought by want of thought as well as want of heart.&rsquo; If  you have this innocent, imaginative young girl looking out for you and thinking  you admire her, you may unsettle her mind; besides, I don&rsquo;t think Rolf Benson  would be too well pleased to think that his betrothed was receiving attention  from a gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe you are right, as usual,&rdquo; said Rupert, turning from the window. &ldquo;To  revert to the classic before quoted, the carrying out of my suggestion would be  more like the occupation found by a certain clever agent for hands destitute of  proper employment. Besides, if the beauty goes in for Sunday-school teaching  and all that sort of thing, she would be rather too good for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  smiled, and added, &ldquo;I am glad she is likely to be married soon. Her mother was  rather at a loss to know what to do with her. She tried dress-making, but it  injured her health. Mrs. Ray once seriously consulted me about an opening which  occurred for making the girl a bar-maid. Such infatuation!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  tell me where,&rdquo; said Rupert, the incorrigible, eagerly, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll frequent that  &lsquo;public.&rsquo; There, don&rsquo;t &lsquo;slaughter me with savage looks,&rsquo; as our friend Robert  Browning says. Really, Laurence, no one would think that, when I was at the  university, I was supposed to be nearly as great a bookworm as your studious  self. It&rsquo;s all our &lsquo;surroundings,&rsquo; believe me. Now, I never read a line except  the newspapers, or a chance novel, until I come into a &lsquo;booky&rsquo; atmosphere like  this; and then I feel the love of literature stir within me. There, write that  letter you threatened before dinner, while I inspect your shelves and upset  them for you; and then I think we can get out &rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 5</strong></h2>
<p>Time  rolled on, summer had passed, and autumn was drawing to a close. Laurence  remained at Everbury, working diligently at his studies and in his parish, the  monotony of his time being relieved by an occasional visit from Rupert, who was  still at Grayminster.</p>
<p>A  change, however, had passed over the family at Malby. It was chiefly  perceptible in Prissy, but anything which affected their only child distressed  and troubled her parents. The girl&rsquo;s lightness of heart appeared to have  forsaken her. She was nervous and low-spirited, and subject to long fits of  depression; her appetite failed, and her step lost its elasticity: her soft  color had nearly all faded away, yet her beauty was by no means diminished,  rather increased, Ethel Blantyre thought, by the extreme delicacy of her  appearance.</p>
<p>Poor  Prissy was very miserable. She could neither describe nor account for her state  of mind. She was conscious of a feeling of lassitude and distaste for all her  former occupations and pleasures. The idea of her marriage, naturally the  principal object of her thoughts, was now becoming hateful to her. Rolf was not  to her what he had been, though she could detect no change in him except an  increased solicitude for her welfare. She scarcely dared to confess to herself that  all her interest was concentrated upon one object&mdash;Mr. Mertoun. Yet, she sought  to argue with herself, she had admired him ever since she had known him, and  why this should make her unhappy she could not tell. He certainly had never  given her cause by word or look to imagine that he felt any particular regard  for her. Had she been well read in Shakespeare she might have applied to  herself the words of Helena:</p>
<p class="note">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Thus  Indian-like,<br>
  Religious in mine error, I adore<br>
  The sun, that looks upon his worshiper,<br>
But knows of him no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy,  however, was no Shakespearian, and thus had not the alleviation of quoting the  words of the immortal bard with reference to her own case. She went on hating  and reviling herself for her folly, yet feeling just as foolish as ever, till  health and spirits alike began to give way.</p>
<p>Of  course it was very silly, quite ridiculous, and Prissy knew this, and it made  her doubly secretive. Sometimes she thought she would ask her parents to send  her away, that she might forget her absurdity in strange scenes where she would  have to exert herself. Again, at the sound of Laurence&rsquo;s voice or step, it  would seem to her as if she never could leave home while he was there. Mr.  Mertoun was so kind, too, always inquiring after her health, and hoping she was  better. Prissy&rsquo;s sense of right bore testimony against her folly. Mr. Mertoun  was a gentleman, and she was only a poor girl. Oh, if the Rays had only  continued to be gentlefolks still, she thought; but then would they ever have  met?</p>
<p>All  this time poor Rolf got the worst of it, being subjected to all sorts of  capricious tempers. Sometimes Prissy appeared struck with remorse for the way  she was treating him, and suddenly became all kindness and affection. Again she  would burst into a fit of hysterical crying at his approach, and beg to be only  let alone, Mr. and Mrs. Ray were seriously alarmed about her, and spoke to the  village doctor. He suggested change of air and variety of occupation. So the  father and mother made arrangements for sending her to an aunt who lived at a  neighboring watering-place. Matters, however, were brought to a crisis by Rolf  Benson. A little farm was vacant, which his father wished to take for him. Rolf  himself was tired of game and poachers; and if Prissy would only consent to be  married immediately, the offer could easily be accepted. But Prissy, to the  amazement of everybody, burst into a fit of nervous sobbing when the marriage  was suggested, and with some incoherent words of refusal, rushed off to her own  room and bolted the door.</p>
<p>Reflection  followed upon excitement. What had she done? Thrown off good, honest Rolf for a  piece of folly which she would be ashamed to confess? It was not so bad as  this, however. Rolf was far too loyal and true to take a hasty rejection of  this kind as final, though his heart sank when he reflected upon many little  slights Prissy had lately offered him. How he puzzled his good, honest mind  about this change in his darling! Could she prefer any one else to him? He knew  she cared for none of the young men in the village. She had rejected one or two  good offers while in town for his sake; and latterly, so far as Rolf knew, she  had seen no one likely to attract her. He felt himself blush when he thought of  Mr. Mertoun. Of course <em>he</em> was a gentleman,  and a good man, and would never do or say anything to disturb Prissy&rsquo;s mind;  still, Rolf had often thought that he had rather such a very good-looking young  man did not live under the roof with his pretty sweetheart.</p>
<p>However,  when Rolf went back to Malby Farm in the evening, Mrs. Ray met him and told him  that Prissy was heartily ashamed of herself for the way in which sh had treated  him, and that she was very anxious for his forgiveness. The poor girl was not  well, Mrs. Ray said, and she couldn&rsquo;t quite help these crying fits.</p>
<p>So  Rolf was appeased; and when he saw Prissy sitting in her arm-chair by the fire,  and looking very pale and interesting, he wondered how he could ever be vexed  with such a lovely, gentle creature; and then to hear her ask his forgiveness  was almost more than he could bear. On one point, however, Prissy was firm. She  would not be married that autumn. Rolf could see, she said, how weak she was  and unfit to leave her own home.</p>
<p>Perhaps  in the spring&mdash; And here her voice faltered, and her faithful lover was forced  to be content with this vague promise.</p>
<p>Prissy  had her own serious doubts as to what she ought to do. At present the idea of  marriage at all was distasteful to her. Her father, she knew, could leave her a  good property, and first she thought she would live at Malby Farm all the rest  of her life, a sort of Lady Bountiful of a lower class. But when it seemed that  she had discarded Rolf forever, by her foolish outburst of passion, she felt  that her love for him was by no means extinct. &ldquo;Oh, if he should go off and  marry Mary Jenkins or some one else!&rdquo; was the thought that distressed her; and  the active presence of jealousy in her heart warned her that love was still  there.</p>
<p>What  would a heroine of romance have done in Prissy&rsquo;s place? Drowned herself,  perhaps, but that was far from being the intention of the belle of Everbury.  Despite her recent unhappiness, life was too precious to be recklessly flung  away.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 6</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  lass, we&rsquo;re likely to have a sick house. Mother&rsquo;s laid up with rheumatism, and  you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;m all right, father,&rdquo; answered Prissy. &ldquo;Going to the sea did me a great deal  of good, and I&rsquo;m quite well since I came home. I&rsquo;m so sorry about mother.&rdquo; And  she went to the invalid with a pang of self-reproach, feeling that perhaps the  illness was brought on by over-exertion, and might have been averted by a  little timely aid in household matters.</p>
<p>Prissy  was much better, both in mind and body, ever since her last reconciliation to  Rolf. Mrs. Ray&rsquo;s illness was short and not severe: still the exertion which it  required from Prissy was beneficial to her&mdash;keeping her from brooding and  castle-building by giving her occupation for her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope Mr. Mertoun does not want for anything when I&rsquo;m not able to get about as  usual,&rdquo; Mrs. Ray would say, anxiously; but her trouble was allayed by Laurence  himself, when he informed her that he had never been more comfortable during  all the pleasant months he had spent under her roof. This was understood as a  compliment to Prissy&rsquo;s housekeeping and repeated accordingly.</p>
<p>I  think Mr. Mertoun looks better than ever; he seems so happy, too.&rdquo; said Mrs.  Ray, one bright October morning, when she had ventured out for a short walk in  the sunshine. Prissy thought she divined the reason of these happy looks. She  had noticed that the curate had recently received several letters in a pretty  feminine hand; and coupling this with a short absence of his, she drew her own  conclusions. Not that any inmate of Malby Farm ever tampered with the lock of  Mr. Mertoun&rsquo;s postbag; but he, careless student that he was, would often leave  envelopes and pieces of letters scattered about his room. Once Prissy had seen  a letter lying on the table, beginning, &ldquo;My own dearest Laurence.&rdquo; Full of  shame at the idea of reading unbidden another person&rsquo;s correspondence, she  withdrew her eyes, all her suspicions confirmed. It may be remarked that Prissy  was quite wrong. The above is perhaps an uncommon address from a sister to a  brother; but then, Grace Mertoun was as sentimental as Prissy herself, and  fully concurred with the latter damsel in thinking the Reverend Laurence a  model of perfection. </p>
<p>Prissy  having built her little castle liked to live in it, and to speculate on what  sort of young lady the future Mrs. L. Mertoun would be. How she longed to peep  into the photographic album to try and find her out. This, however, she felt  would be too great a liberty. Prissy&rsquo;s fancy for the curate was gradually  becoming a thing of the past; Sometimes she almost felt inclined to laugh at  her folly; yet the idea of her approaching marriage with Rolf was not wholly  palatable.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 7</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Busy  as ever, Laurence; you certainly are a reproach to an idle wretch like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  never myself believed much in your love for literature, Rupert,&rdquo; replied  Laurence, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  well, I hold that is a thing of the past, existed once and died a natural  death, like many a better thing belonging to many a better man. But this isn&rsquo;t  anything about &lsquo;Western Creeds,&rsquo; is it? No; German, I declare. &lsquo;Egmont.&rsquo; Oh, I  remember reading that at school. What are you doing with it? Are you thinking  of a trip to the Continent, and trying to revive your knowledge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  replied Laurence. &ldquo;My friend Lyster, the publisher, is bringing out a  translation of Goethe&rsquo;s dramas, and has asked me to undertake some of them. I  was going to London about that when I wrote to see if you could come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  commend me to industry. I suppose you are making mints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,  I am very well paid for what is really a pleasure to me; and now, lest I forget  it, I want you to take charge of a parcel for me to Grayminster. Here it is.  You see it is directed to Hatchell &amp; Wing, my solicitors, in Weston Street,  There is some money with which to meet a payment, besides some important  papers, and also some sheets of &lsquo;Western Creeds,&rsquo; which Luke Hatchell has  promised to look over for me. You know he combines the attorney and literary  man. I&rsquo;ll write to him to send to you for them. You see how precious the parcel  is; and you won&rsquo;t let anything happen to it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll be careful, never fear,&rdquo; replied Rupert. &ldquo;By the bye, how is Dulcinea&mdash;I  mean Jacqueline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rupert,&rdquo;  said Laurence, seriously, &ldquo;that is a subject on which I wish very much to speak  to you. You remember the story of Egmont, I dare say: I suspect part of it is  being reacted here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?  Who&rsquo;s going to behead you?&rdquo; asked Rupert, looking up suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  a superficial view you take of things!&rdquo; said Laurence, pettishly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t  refer to the political part of the drama at all. It is the glimpse into private  life to which I wish to draw your attention. Clare has been happy with her  burgher, lover, Brackenburg, until Count Egmont comes upon the scene; then  there is some short-lived and spurious happiness, ending in despair and death,  Rupert, you cannot misunderstand me. Have you been acting the part or Egmont?  Have you been poisoning the mind of an innocent girl, and rendering her  dissatisfied with her humble lover, once the object of her choice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really,  Laurence,&rdquo; said Rupert, rising and pushing back his chair with such force that  it fell. &lsquo;It is just like the time when we were boys together, and everything  that was wrong was Rupert, Rupert, Rupert, over and over again! By some  extraordinary right you saw fit to constitute yourself my Mentor, or <em>tor</em>mentor rather; and I beg you will  remember that I am as much a man as yourself, and not to be twitted in this  way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sorry to see you so angry, Rupert,&rdquo; replied Laurence, calmly; &ldquo;and if I have  suspected you unjustly, I beg your pardon; but, recollect, you have not  answered my question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  then,&rdquo; said Rupert, whose passion was rapidly cooling, &ldquo;I give you my solemn  word, or my oath if you prefer it, that I never in my life addressed one  syllable to Miss Ray, except when you were by; and I believe I once said &lsquo;Thank  you&rsquo; to her, for which she repaid me with a smile, which&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am most relieved to hear you say so, Rupert,&rdquo; replied Laurence, interrupting  him. I am most thankful my brother is not to blame. Still I cannot but fear  that some one has been tampering with that poor girl. She is quite altered in  appearance lately. Her mother tells me she is subject to fretting, and will not  consent to appoint the time for her marriage. I have seen her about the house  more than usual lately, as Mrs. Ray has been ill, and I do observe a change in  her. Mrs. Ray, indeed, wanted me to speak to the girl, and try and bring her to  reason; but of course I could not interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  unless you set up the confessional. I say, Laurence, you might do worse. I&rsquo;d  like myself to know which of wicked little Blanche Blantyre&rsquo;s transgressions in  the heart-breaking line lie heavy on her conscience; but as to Ethel, I don&rsquo;t  think you could establish much pastoral influence over her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can  you not be serious on any subject, Rupert?&rdquo; asked Laurence, rather severely. &ldquo;As  I was saying, I wonder who is at the bottom of this business of Miss Ray&rsquo;s.  Perhaps Lewis Blantyre. He comes here pretty often, and I once saw him look at  her in a way I greatly disliked.&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  don&rsquo;t go and fly at <em>him</em> as you did at  me just now, I advise you,&rdquo; said Rupert; &ldquo;or, indeed, now that I think of it,  you may, provided you address him in exactly the same terms. I suppose his  ideas of Goethe&rsquo;s dramas are about as clear as my notion of the contents of the  Shasters, or those delectable-looking Eddas which I found you studying the  other day. But see, it&rsquo;s getting dark already, and I have an engagement in  town. I must aim for the half-past five train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rupert  had been gone about twenty minutes before Laurence perceived that he had  forgotten the important parcel. This was provoking, as it was rather precious  to trust to the post, and the payment fell due the next day but one. &ldquo;Careless  fellow,&rdquo; thought Laurence, &ldquo;when I kept it on purpose, knowing he would be here  to-day. I must take it up to Grayminster myself to-morrow, I suppose; yet I can&rsquo;t  very well, for I have my class and evening service, I shall have to go up by  the night train. It&rsquo;s very provoking!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly  a happy thought occurred to Laurence. He had heard Farmer Ray say that he was  going to Grayminster on Wednesday, The parcel would be quite safe with him, and  the solicitors could be directed by the night post to send to another address.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  going up to London, sir, for a few days,&rdquo; said the farmer, when questioned by  Laurence. &ldquo;But my lass here&mdash;I leave her at Grayminster until Saturday; she&rsquo;ll  take charge of anything for you, I&rsquo;m sure, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy  blushed and smiled, and signified her willingness; and Laurence, having taken  down her Grayminster address, and ascertained the train by which she was going,  told her he would give her the packet in the morning.</p>
<p>Certainly  if Laurence had ever been inclined to question the truth of his landlady&rsquo;s  assertion that &ldquo;the Rays were once gentlefolks,&rdquo; all his doubts would have been  dispelled when he saw Prissy in her new winter dress standing on the  gravel-walk that bright October morning. It was hard to realize that she was  only a farmer&rsquo;s daughter going out for a holiday. And Prissy&mdash;she liked to  believe that Mr. Mertoun was waiting and watching for her. He must have been  watching, for the moment the front door opened he came down, parcel in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,  Miss Ray,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a lovely day for your journey! I bring you this,  which you kindly undertook to convey for me. My careless brother forgot it  yesterday. I have told Mr. Hatchell your address, that he may send for the  parcel. It is rather valuable, so perhaps you can make room for it in your  hand-bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,  sir,&rdquo; and Prissy, growing very red, stuffed it in. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t let it out of my  sight till it&rsquo;s sent for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank  you,&rdquo; replied Laurence. &ldquo;I know it is safe with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  then he opened the gate for her as courteously as he had done for Ethel  Blantyre, while Prissy colored again with pleasure.</p>
<p>Turning  back to the house, Laurence thought that after all his papers would very likely  be safer with Prissy than with a heedless youth like Rupert, who was rather  famous for mislaying things.</p>
<p>Rolf  was waiting outside the gate. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s father?&rdquo; said Prissy, stopping short, as  she saw her lover alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  gone on; he bid me wait; what did parson want with you all this time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rolf  spoke rather impatiently, for the vague feeling of jealousy was stirring again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  gave me a very precious parcel to carry to town. Here, Rolf, what shall I do?  Wait a minute. It&rsquo;s coming out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  carry it. It&rsquo;s too big for the bag.&rdquo; said Rolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, no. I promised to keep it myself. There, hold the bag open for me,&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  Prissy squeezed the parcel in again, Rolf noticed that it was addressed to</p>
<p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Messrs.  Hatchell &amp; Wing,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Weston Street,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &ldquo;Grayminster&rdquo;</em></p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 8</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  Kate on the platform, Prissy,&rdquo; said Mr. Ray, as the train steamed into Grayminster;  and after an affectionate parting, Prissy was consigned to the care of her  cousin, Miss Kate Smithwick, superintendent of the millinery department of Messrs,  Bell &amp; Boyd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write  to mother and tell her you are safe,&rdquo; shouted Mr. Ray, as the train began to  move; and Prissy&rsquo;s first business on returning to the scene of her former  labors was to dispatch a note to Malby Farm.</p>
<p>About  eight o&rsquo;clock the next morning the usual messenger came up to the farm with Mr.  Mertoun&rsquo;s post-bag and Prissy&rsquo;s letter.</p>
<p>The  door was opened by Mrs. Whyte, Prissy&rsquo;s aunt, who had come in for a few days to  keep house for poor Mrs. Ray, still a sufferer from rheumatism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Mrs. Whyte,&rdquo; said Joe, the post-boy, turning over his handful of letters, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s  well, <em>I</em> say, Miss Ray had come home  before this terrible work!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Whyte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  didn&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; rejoined Joe, telling his tale with, that satisfaction too  often displayed by the bearers of evil tidings. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a terrible fire  last night at Bell &amp; Boyd&rsquo;s, where Miss Prissy was working at Easter. &lsquo;Fire  and rumored loss of life,&rsquo; they call it. It&rsquo;ll all be in parson&rsquo;s paper. He&rsquo;ll  show it you, I&rsquo;m sure. We were all saying down at the post this morning how  well it was Miss Prissy&mdash; But, Mrs. Whyte, ma&rsquo;am, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  hush&mdash;do hush; don&rsquo;t talk so loud,&rdquo; said the poor woman, with a distracted air.  &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Joe, don&rsquo;t say another word about it here. The poor child went to  Grayminster only yesterday. Oh, what will her mother do? I never could tell  her. Oh, I don&rsquo;t know what to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Laurence  sat at his breakfast-table about half an hour after the postman had gone.  Having looked over his letters, he unfolded his <em>Grayminster Journal</em> and glanced over the leading article. There was  nothing particular in it, so he turned to the second side, where the first  words that caught his eye were &ldquo;Destructive Fire and rumored loss of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  had nearly finished the paragraph relating the total destruction of the  premises of Messrs. Bell &amp; Boyd, Low Street, before a thought occurred to  him which caused him to start up in dismay. Was not this the very address to  which his solicitors were to send for his valuable packet? and were all &mdash; his money,  his family papers, and his manuscript destroyed in the conflagration?</p>
<p>Laurence  struck his hand over his forehead in despair. Why had he not foreseen this? Why  had he intrusted his valuables to any hand but his own? Hark! What was that  sound below? A wild, wailing cry, as of some one in intense agony. Some one  else was in as great distress as himself. Surely yes, selfish that he was, he  had forgotten for the moment the precious life which had probably been lost  with his property in the devouring flames.</p>
<p>Laurence  hurried down to the kitchen whence the sounds of sorrow proceeded. Here he  found Mrs. Ray sobbing hysterically, while her sister, Mrs. Whyte, vainly  trying to command her voice, knelt beside her, offering all sorts of  conjectural consolation. Rolf, too, was standing by the table. He had  apparently brought in the account, as he held a crushed copy of the <em>Journal</em> in his hand. Mrs. Whyte had not  ventured to tell her sister. Rolf was very pale, but calm and collected,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Mr. Mertoun, did you hear?&rdquo; sobbed the unhappy mother. &ldquo;My child, my poor  child. To think that I&rsquo;ll never see her again!&rdquo; and the sobs redoubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  trust, Mrs. Ray, it is not so bad as that,&rdquo; said Laurence, as calmly as he  could. &ldquo;This suspense is hard for you to bear. I have to go up to Grayminster  this morning, and I shall make all inquiries for you, and I do hope and trust  your fears may prove untrue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  if I could only go myself,&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Ray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you can&rsquo;t, Elizabeth,&rdquo; said her sister, and indeed the fact was evident, for,  although recovering, Mrs. Ray was still too weak to walk up-stairs without  help, and no one could tell what effect this shock might have upon her nerves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  my poor child&rsquo;s letter, and the father away, and the child writing to tell me  she was so safe and happy, and only the day before she said she wouldn&rsquo;t go  until I was better; and I made her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  could bear it no longer. His own loss still weighed heavily on his mind. No one  seemed to think of it but himself. How indeed should the others, when, for the  present at least, their own sorrow was incomparably greater? Still the girl <em>might</em> be safe, while there was scarcely  any chance for the packet. Who could think of such a thing in the hurry and  confusion of escaping from a fire? Still there was a shadow of hope. Luke  Hatchell might have sent to Low Street over-night. Then Laurence recollected  that he had explicitly said it was to be called for on Thursday morning. It  seemed as if his evil genius had been at his elbow prompting him. Although his  property was probably irretrievably lost, Laurence resolved to go to Grayminster,  at first rather from restlessness than any other motive. Now he would have an  object in inquiring for the poor girl, whose holiday had been marked by such a  disastrous event.</p>
<p>As  Laurence walked into the railway-station at about half-past ten, he was  surprised to see Rolf Benson there before him. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Going  to Grayminster, Rolf?&rdquo; he said, as the keeper touched his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; I couldn&rsquo;t bear to wait,&rdquo; said the young man, whose whole appearance  seemed changed by the shock of the morning. &ldquo;It was very good of you, Mr.  Mertoun, but I thought somebody nearer might be wanted, perhaps to identify&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  the speaker seemed on the point of breaking down,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  cheer up, my good fellow,&rdquo; said Laurence, in his most encouraging tone. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m  sure it won&rsquo;t be so bad as that. Very likely you will bring Miss Ray back with  you this evening, little the worse for her fright. I wish&mdash;&rdquo; my papers were as  safe, he was going to say, but realizing the utter heartlessness and  selfishness of the speech, he forbore to finish it.</p>
<p>At  this moment the train came up. Laurence ensconced himself comfortably in the  corner of a first-class carriage. By and by, he thought, he might have to  retrench in trifles, but he did not care to begin yet. Rolf was not sorry that  difference of rank separated him from the curate on the journey, short though  it was. The third-class, however, was very crowded, and the poor young man  would have been glad that morning to have traveled alone.</p>
<p>Laurence  was unaccustomed to come in contact with sorrow and suffering, save in a  strictly clerical capacity. He felt bewildered, and unable to speak as he  wished. He quite dreaded returning to Malby Farm in the evening, if all was not  well with Prissy. He puzzled himself, too, to think whether any steps could be  taken to repair his own loss, the precious MS. The money&mdash;well, it was gone, but  its equivalent might be gained anew. And then the irreparable loss of the legal  documents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  think no more of it until I consult with Hatchell,&rdquo; was his determination, as  he unfolded his newspaper and glanced over the remaining news of the day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benson  is here to make inquiries about the girl, so I can go to Weston Street first,&rdquo;  thought Laurence.</p>
<p>He  hurried off to his solicitors, rang the bell with a beating heart, and was  admitted into the office, where the first thing he saw was his own packet,  directed in his large, legible handwriting, to Messrs. Hatchell &amp; Wing, Weston  Street.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 9</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Mertoun, so there you are!&rdquo; said Mr. Luke Hatchell, as Laurence stopped for a  moment in astonishment. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mystery about this parcel of yours: I was  just going to telegraph to you about it, as soon as I had time to examine the  contents. It was left here a short time ago by a Mr.&mdash;Mr. Elliott, of Grosvenor  Buildings. He left his card and a memorandum about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show  me,&rdquo; said Laurence, and with some surprise he read:</p>
<p class="note">&ldquo;The  accompanying packet was put into my hands last night, at the great fire in Low  Street, by a young woman, who seemed much agitated, and had apparently escaped  from the burning house. I undertook to deliver it this morning at the office of  Messrs. Hatchell &amp; Wing.</p>
<p class="note">(Signed)  JOHN ELLIOTT&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m thankful to &lsquo;John Elliott,&rsquo; whoever he is,&rdquo; said Laurence, with a sigh of  relief. &ldquo;I sent the packet yesterday by a young woman, a parishioner of mine,  who was coming up to stay at that unfortunate shop. I&rsquo;m glad it&rsquo;s safe. I  thought it was certainly lost; and it would have been a serious matter to me. I  see Bell is largely insured. What about the loss of life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much  less than was commonly supposed. Those accounts are always exaggerated at  first. People have such a morbid relish for the horrible. The present opinion  is that no one was burned. Some of the work-girls are injured, but are expected  to recover. You saw by the newspaper that the sufferers were removed to the  Ellicott Hospital. So now come in to luncheon; it ought to be ready by this  time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While  Laurence was thus re-assured as to the safety of his papers, Rolf was devoting  all his energies to find out whether poor Prissy had survived the dreadful  night. The Ellicott Hospital was at the far end of the town from the  railway-station; and the way lay directly through Low Street, the scene of the  recent fire. Rolf had turned into the street before he was aware of the fact.  There was a large crowd gathered about the still smoking premises. A cord had  been drawn by the police to keep the by-standers from pressing into danger. The  house was completely gutted, and the front wall was hourly expected to fall.  The blistered paint on doors and windows at the opppsite side of the street  bore witness to the fierce heat of the flames. Rolf gazed and shuddered. As he  made his way slowly through the crowd, he heard a man who had seen it all,  giving a graphic description of the whole scene, adding, moreover, that it was  believed to be a mistake that any one had been burned alive. The rumor  originated in the fact that some young women had been in the kitchen, but it  seemed they knew of a way of escape, and had been but little injured. Every one  from up-stairs was supposed to be safe. This man had heard that Miss Smithwick  had been rescued, but he knew nothing of a Miss Ray.</p>
<p>And  Rolf went on, sick at heart, until he reached the Ellicott Hospital. Here he  met an important, bustling little doctor in the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ray?  No one of that name here, eh, porter?&rdquo; said the little man, taking snuff.</p>
<p>A  medical student standing by suggested something in an undertone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Identification?  ay, perhaps,&rdquo; said the doctor, turning to Rolf; &ldquo;but their friends have claimed  them all,&rdquo; added he to the student. &ldquo;No one seems to be missing, thank  Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except,  sir&rdquo;&mdash;and the student&rsquo;s words were again inaudible to the by-standers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay.  Exactly,&rdquo; replied the doctor. &ldquo;Quite so.&rdquo; Then addressing Rolf, &ldquo;What did you  call your friend, young man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Priscilla  Ray, sir,&rdquo; replied Rolf, with a sort of vague terror, lest she, the stranger in  the house, should have been missed by no one, and left to perish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ray?  I&rsquo;m afraid it won&rsquo;t do, But how do you spell it? W, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;R-a-y  in this family,&rdquo; replied Rolf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  yes, young man&mdash;then there is a person answering to this description here. &lsquo;P.  R.&rsquo; her linen is marked, the nurse tells me; but, I&rsquo;m sorry to say, for your  sake, she&rsquo;s the worst case from the fire. Not so much burned, indeed, but she&rsquo;s  in brain-fever, in a very precarious state indeed. You don&rsquo;t mind coming into  the fever ward I dare say? Under the circumstances, you can see her if you  like, though it&rsquo;s not generally allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mind  going into the fever-ward, indeed! Rolf would have rushed through the blazing  house itself for Prissy&rsquo;s sake. In anxious silence he followed the doctor.</p>
<p>Yes,  there she lay, on a low, open hospital bed. A good deal of her rich brown hair  had been cut away, and the nurse was bathing her head with some cooling lotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is quieter now,&rdquo; nurse said to the doctor.</p>
<p>Rolf  bent over her. Her eyes were open, but she evidently did not know him.</p>
<p>Suddenly  there was a clutching of the hands and a murmuring, and Prissy began to talk  volubly and incoherently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  was going on all the morning like that, off and on, sir,&rdquo; said the nurse.  &ldquo;Sometimes its nonsense no one could understand, and then it&rsquo;s about a packet  and some one that was to give it to some one else, and was it safe?  Listen&mdash;there it is again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No;  it was only a low wail. Something about mother, and the gentleman, and then  incoherency again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think,&rdquo; said the nurse to Rolf, after the doctor had gone, &ldquo;that packet is upon  her mind. Do you know anything about it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rolf  reflected. Could it be Mr. Mertoun&rsquo;s packet which he had given into her charge?  Nurse thought it likely, for the poor girl had used the name Mertoun over and  over again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  I could only think of the place where it was to go, I&rsquo;d try to find out about  it,&rdquo; said Rolf. &ldquo;I can do no good here,&rdquo; he added, sadly; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she  even knows me. Bird? was that the name? No. Wing&mdash;Wing in Weston Street. I have  it now, ma&rsquo;am. I&rsquo;ll go and ask about the parcel. But do you think the doctor  would let me come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are  you her brother, sir?&rdquo; asked nurse.</p>
<p>Cunning  woman; she guessed the state of affairs well enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  I&rsquo;m her&mdash; That is, I was to have been married to her &mdash;leastways, I was once; but  she wasn&rsquo;t so kind to me lately. However, if I could only see her well, I  wouldn&rsquo;t care so very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  pass, however, was easily procured for Rolf, and he started off to find Weston  Street, convinced, at the same time, that he was on a fruitless errand.  Anything, however, was better than forced inertion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Hatchell  &amp; Wing, Solicitors.&rsquo; This must be it,&rdquo; thought Rolf, as he rang at the  door.</p>
<p>To  his surprise he saw Laurence Mertoun. apparently in the highest spirits, coming  out of the door at the end of the hall which lead to the private house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Rolf,&rdquo; said the curate of Everbury, &ldquo;so it&rsquo;s all right? Miss Ray acted bravely  in saving my papers, and I hear she escaped last night, Did you find her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir; in the Ellicott Hospital, in brain fever,&rdquo; replied Rolf, in a tone of  undisguised contempt.</p>
<p>Papers,  indeed! What was it to save <em>papers?</em> Poor ignorant Rolf had little or no idea of  the value of MSS. of family documents. He might have had a little more respect  for checks or bank-notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brain  fever!&rdquo; cried Laurence, in real concern. &ldquo;I had no idea. Poor Girl! I was in  hopes we could have taken her home this evening.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 10</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Would  the doctor not think it advisable to remove her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  speaker was Laurence Mertoun. This was his first introduction to the interior  of an hospital, and it did not strike him at all pleasantly. The comfortless  look of the rooms, uncarpeted floors, uncurtained windows, low narrow beds, the  oppressive smell of ether, and an occasional groan from the lips of a sufferer,  struck a chill to his heart. He could not bear the idea of pretty, carefully  nurtured Prissy remaining there. Laurence had never been in the habit of  visiting the city poor in their homes, and therefore had no idea of the  inestimable blessing of such institutions. His prevalent feeling was that  Prissy must be got away as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  sir,&rdquo; said the resident pupil, in answer to Laurence&rsquo;s query, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t myself  think she would be fit to be moved for some time. However, if you wish, I can  ask Dr. Grubb when he comes this afternoon. He said he would look in again. It  seems to me that the chief things she wants are ventilation and careful  nursing. And she will probably have both better here than she would at home.  You see she hardly knows anything that is going on, and moving would certainly  be a risk, if not fatal. For my own part, if I was ill myself, I had far rather  be here than trust to willing but unskillful nursing from my own people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  felt that the student was right, and having promised to defray any extra  expense that might he thought desirable for the poor girl, he left the  hospital, feeling that he had done all that could be required of him. It seemed  to him that nurse and pupil were cold, almost indifferent in their manner. Yet  how, he asked himself, could it be otherwise? when poor Prissy was to them only  one of a multitude, to be tended a little while, and then forgotten.</p>
<p>Passing  through the hall, Laurence came upon Dr, Grubb in earnest conversation with  Rolf. The doctor would not hear of Prissy being stirred. &ldquo;If she was a princess  of the blood, sir, she should stay where she is for the present.&rdquo; The good man  did not seem in the least distressed at the idea that the girl&rsquo;s mother was ill  and could not come to her. &ldquo;Much better so,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t have my patients  fussed; people coming in and making them homesick and keeping them back. This  good fellow&rsquo;&rsquo;&mdash;turning to Rolf&mdash;&ldquo;will see her whenever he pleases, provided she  is fit to see him, and he can report progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do not then despair of her life, doctor?&rdquo; said Laurence, considerably relieved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  to her life or death, young man, that is in a higher Hand than either yours or  mine. All I can promise is care and attention. Rest assured that all that  medical skill can do for her shall be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laurence  left the hospital, feeling rather indignant at being addressed as &ldquo;young man,&rdquo;  and convinced that the attendants on the sick poor were the most unfeeling  people in the world. He would have retracted his harsh judgment had he seen Dr.  Grubb five minutes later by the bedside of the suffering girl adjusting her  bandages, and soothing her agitation with a skill and gentleness surpassing  that of any woman, the peculiar tenderness of a kind-hearted doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  burns are nothing at all,&rdquo; said he to the nurse, &ldquo;but there are symptoms about  her I don&rsquo;t like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was weeks before Laurence heard full particulars of the rescue of his precious  papers. The account was contained in a letter from Miss Smithwick to her aunt,  Mrs. Ray. It appeared that early hours were kept at Messrs. Bell and Boyd&rsquo;s and  nearly every one in the house was asleep when the fire broke out. It was  supposed to have originated below stairs; no one, of course, knew how. Prissy  shared her cousin&rsquo;s room, and she with Miss Smithwick and a few of the  work-girls who slept in the house, half dressed, were making the best of their  way down-stairs, when suddenly, with some exclamation about a packet, she  turned back, and was lost in a cloud of smoke. All gave her up for lost. It was  useless to follow her, and the party on the stairs reached the street with some  injuries&mdash;Miss Smithwick had a fall, and severely strained her right hand.  Fire-escapes were put up at the windows, and the firemen mounted to seek the  missing girls, and many of those who had in reality made their escape through  the lower back premises were supposed to have perished. At length, a few  minutes before the staircase fell in Prissy rushed out through the smoke into  the street. No one knew how she had escaped with her life. She seemed to have  lost all control over herself, and ran about wildly, brandishing a packet above  her head. Some policemen on the spot were endeavoring to keep order; they had  already taken most of the sufferers to the Ellicott Hospital, and seeing  Prissy&rsquo;s frantic gestures, one of them tried to restrain her, and bring her  gently to a place of safety. The poor girl screamed, and shrank away in terror,  appealing for protection to a gentleman in the crowd, whom she besought to  deliver the packet which she held at its address. He took it with kind soothing  words, promising to take charge of it, but even as he spoke the poor girl sank  back in a death-like swoon. When she rallied she was lying on a narrow bed in  the Ellicott Hospital, and the hand of fever was upon her.</p>
<p>Before  Miss Smithwick was able to write, however, Prissy&rsquo;s health was returning. She  was still in the hospital, for she was very weak, and had learned to rely so  much upon Dr. Grubb, that she felt she could not dispense with him. She was now  an inmate of the convalescent ward, and was surrounded by comforts provided by  thoughtful friends.</p>
<p>Now  that the fever was quite gone, Dr. Grubb encouraged visitors. Prissy&rsquo;s father  had been to see her several times, and Mrs. Ray had once accomplished the  journey; but the effort and excitement had proved too much for her strength,  and she was unable to repeat the visit. The Miss Blantyres had called two or  three times when they were in the town, bringing some of the choicest produce  of the Comerford hot-houses; for the escape of the village beauty had made  quite a sensation at Everbury, from the Hall downward. Good-natured Rupert  Mertoun had left more than one bouquet of hot-house flowers for Prissy, and the  nurse used to rally her often about the smart young officer who seemed so  concerned for her recovery. Prissy could smile at jokes of this kind now. She  felt in herself that her days of foolish romance were over, for during her  illness and tedious convalescence she had been learning a lesson which was to  have a practical effect upon her future life.</p>
<p>It  is needless to say that during Prissy&rsquo;s tedious hours of suffering Rolf was  constantly at her side. When it was believed she was dying. Sir Baldwin felt  for the poor youth, and gave orders that he should be exempted from duty, so  that he might be near her: and many a morning Rolf walked the ten miles between  Everbury and Grayminster.</p>
<p>There  is something very affecting in the tenderness of a strong, rough man to a child  or an invalid. The hospital nurse used to say it brought tears to her eyes to  see that big man and that poor weak girl, adding to one of her assistants,  &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my belief if she isn&rsquo;t kind to him, and won&rsquo;t have him, she doesn&rsquo;t know  what she&rsquo;s throwing away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When  Prissy could walk a few tottering steps, it was Rolfs strong arm that supported  her. Indeed, his constant attendance used to amuse the other patients in the  convalescent ward. But he was a prime favorite with the doctor, and could go in  and out as he pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  think he thought there was no one in the world but her,&rdquo; said a patient one day  to nurse, when Rolf and Prissy were sitting in the garden of the hospital.</p>
<p>Poor  girl, <em>she</em> had a lover, too, but he was far across the seas. Perhaps she thought  if he had been by her side recovery would have been quicker and pleasanter.</p>
<p>At  last the day came when Prissy was pronounced sufficiently well to return home.  Kindness followed her still. Sir Baldwin had sent a carriage to Grayminster for  repair, and, at the instigation of his daughters, he sent word to Farmer Ray  that he might have the use of it, when ready, to drive his daughter home. So  Prissy went back to Everbury in state, escorted by her father; and truly glad  she was to see Malby Farm again, though she parted with regret from her kind  friends at the hospital.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 11</strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  mother, Rolf was very good to me when I was in the hospital. I didn&rsquo;t deserve  it, I know, after the way I treated him; but he never said another word about  marrying, and&mdash;I&rsquo;m grown ugly now, and I feel worn out, and I don&rsquo;t think he  really cares about me, since I got better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was now poor Prissy&rsquo;s deliberate conviction, though it was not uttered without  some tears, for it was very painful to her. Rolf had completely won upon her by  his gentleness and generosity, but she did not yet fully understand him, or she  would have known that his silence on the subject that lay nearest his heart was  but another proof of his consideration, fearing a repetition of the distress  which he had caused her in the autumn. Prissy, however, was fanciful and foolish,  and still weak from recent illness. The fancied loss of her beauty, too, was a  cause of distress to her, for with the return of health she discovered that her  appearance was not quite a matter of indifference to her. &ldquo;What a fright!&rdquo; she  had said, pettishly, when she first saw her short hair and prominent  cheek-bones in the glass, turning away quite unconsoled by nurse&rsquo;s friendly  suggestion that her face was unmarked by the fire.</p>
<p>During  her time in the hospital, Prissy&rsquo;s feelings had undergone a thorough revulsion.  Her very vague and shadowy romance was now like a half-remembered dream; and  but for her conduct toward poor Rolf, she could have laughed aloud when she  thought of it. The idea of &ldquo;falling in love&rdquo; with Mr. Mertoun! It was too  absurd! When the subject of her late undefined imaginings came in to see her,  with his customary courtesy, hoping she was not too tired of her journey, and  expressing lifelong obligation to her, etc., etc., she blushed and looked down,  as if she feared he could read her foolish thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Douglas&rsquo;s  farm will be vacant about Christmas,&rdquo; said Rolf the next evening to Mrs. Ray. &ldquo;I  wonder whether Prissy would listen to me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try  her, my lad. and my blessing be with you,&rdquo; answered the mother; and Rolf did  try, and Prissy said a great deal which made the honest fellow feel very  awkward, and a great deal that made him very happy.</p>
<p>The  bargain was struck, and Douglas&rsquo;s farm was taken. However, when Christmas came  Prissy was still far from strong, though health was every day returning. Spring  was far advanced before all were agreed that she was sufficiently well to take  upon herself the onerous duties of housekeeper and farmer&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,  Laurence, I thought you would surely have been in Grayminster yesterday,&rdquo; said  Rupert, one April morning. &ldquo;There was the Bishop and all the big wigs and  little wigs, and St. Thomas&rsquo;s bells were chiming half the day. I don&rsquo;t think a  parson in the diocese was absent, except yourself, I thought perhaps you were  ill, so I just ran down to see, and find you up to the eyes in papers, as  usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know all about it,&rdquo; said Laurence, quietly, &ldquo;and I was sorry not to be in town  yesterday; but the fact is, it was the day of Miss Ray&rsquo;s wedding, and I had  promised to officiate, and could not break my appointment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  so Clare&rsquo;s married at last To Brackenburg, I hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  Brackenburg; that is Rolf Benson, and a good worthy-fellow he is too. They were  the first couple I ever married, though I&rsquo;ve been ten months in holy orders. I  sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t easily forget the wedding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you never discovered who played the part of Count Egmont?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,  Rupert,&rdquo; answered the unconscious Laurence. &ldquo;However, if he ever existed,  except in my own fancy, I think she has forgotten him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now, as we are on the all-absorbing subject of matrimony, may I ask, brother  mine, when do you intend to follow good examples?&rdquo; asked Rupert.</p>
<p>But  Laurence, for reply, pointed to the first sheets of &ldquo;Western Creed&rdquo; which lay,  fresh from the printer, on the table before him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h2>
<p>Five-and-twenty  years ago, Helmstone-by-the-Sea was almost as gay and as fashionable a resort  as it is now. It was the holiday ground&mdash;the lungs of London&mdash;just as it is now.  Of course it was not so big. The development of gay little Helmstone during the  last quarter of a century is in some wise phenomenal. It has grown a new pier,  a grand hotel, an aquarium, a colossal and splendid swimming-bath in place of a  small and shabby one. It has grown new churches, new streets, new terraces,  crescents, club-houses, rinks, concert-rooms, gardens, promenades, winter-drives.  All the good things that a sea-side resort can offer to resident or visitor are  duly provided by Helmstone. It boasts the prettiest shops, the cleverest  doctors and dentists, the keenest lawyers, the blandest riding-masters, the  most accomplished professors of music and art that all England can show.  Novelties and prettinesses come into being at Helmstone even before they are  seen in Bond Street. It is as if they were wafted across the Channel by some  magical power. From the Palais Royal to the Queen&rsquo;s Parade is but a step.</p>
<p>Yes,  Helmstone has doubled, trebled, quadrupled itself in wealth and splendor  since those old days when &ldquo;Pam&rdquo; was a power, and the Indian mutiny was still  fresh in the minds of men; when Macaulay&rsquo;s History and Tennyson&rsquo;s Idylls were  new books. It has swollen and spread itself over the face of the surrounding  country; it has swallowed up its own suburbs and green parks, like another  Saturn devouring his children; and elderly people look back upon that cozy  little Helmstone of a quarter of a century ago with a touch of fond regret.</p>
<p>What  a pleasant place it was in those days, with its sparkling parade and narrowest  of side streets, its shabby old baths, and (shabby old pier, and old-fashioned  hotels&mdash;not a <em>table-d&rsquo;hote</em> in the  whole town&mdash;private sitting-rooms, stately little dinners, and wax-candles, in  the good old Georgian manner&mdash;expensive, exclusive, dull. Helmstone had its own  Duke&mdash;its own resident Duke&mdash;in that corner mansion on the cliff at the east end  of the town. Helmstone had its single old-established club. Helmstone had still  a Royal flavor, as having been, thirty or forty years before, the chosen resort  of princes.</p>
<p>To  an old fogy it seems as if there were prettier girls marching up and down the  Queen&rsquo;s Parade in those days; better favored, grander-looking men. Every other  man one met between four and five on a November afternoon had the air of Life  Guards or Hussars. One seemed to hear the clink of spurs and the jingle of  sabretache as those tall mustached youths strode by, with golden lockets and  fusee-boxes flashing on their waistcoats, clad in peg-top trousers and rough  overcoats. All the girls had golden hair shining under pork-pie hats, and dainty  little seal-skin jackets, and flounced silk frocks, showing the neat little  boot and slender ankle, just revealing at windy corners that portion of the  feminine anatomy which French novelists describe as &ldquo;the birth of the leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was at this lesser Helmstone, at the old Theater Royal&mdash;a smaller, shabbier  building than the theater of to-day&mdash;that Miss Rosalie Morton appeared as  fairy-queen in the pantomime of &ldquo;Gulliver and the Golden Goose; or, Harlequin  Little Boy Blue, and Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow?&rdquo; in  the New Year of 1860.</p>
<p>Now  the <em>role</em> of queen of the fairies in a  Christmas pantomime is not the loftiest walk in the British drama. It does not  rank among the Portias and Juliets and Lady Teazles. The fairy-queen is apt to  be snubbed by the first singing chambermaid who plays &ldquo;Mary, Mary, quite  contrary,&rdquo; and even to be looked down upon by the <em>premiere danseuse</em>; but still there is a certain dignity about the  part which is respected by the gallery, and regarded kindly by boxes and pit.</p>
<p>Above  all, the fairy-queen should be young and pretty. A plain or an elderly queen  would be a blot upon any pantomime. The first dancer may be as old as she  likes, provided her legs are nimble and her petticoats well put on&mdash;it is for  her steps she is valued; but the queen of the fairies must be young and fair  and gracious-looking.</p>
<p>So  young, so fair, so gracious, was assuredly Miss Rosalie Morton, the queen of  that particular Christmas entertainment of Gulliver and Mary. She was not quite  eighteen years of age, and she had only been on the stage just six months. It  had been considered great promotion for her when, after trying her young wings,  as it were, and familiarizing herself with the glare of the footlights at the  little theater in the Isle of Wight, she had been engaged&mdash;for the sake of her  pretty face, <em>bien entendu</em>&mdash;by Mr. de  Courtenay, of the Theater Royal, Helmstone.</p>
<p>Mr.  de Courtenay was the kindest of men and of managers. His actors and actresses  adored him. He was so thoroughly good, so friendly, so honorable, so  conscientious, that it was impossible to grumble at anything he did; so as  actors and actresses must grumble, they all found fault with the stage-manager,  who was a good, honest soul, but not quite so cultivated a person as a stage-manager  ought to be, and who cast the pieces in a rough and ready way which was  intensely irritating to the artists whose talents and individual rights he so  often disregarded.</p>
<p>For  once in a way, however, Mr. Badger was right when he cast Rosalie Morton for  the part of fairy-queen in the pantomime. She had only about a hundred lines of  doggerel to pronounce, doggerel highly spiced with those local and topical  allusions which enhance the charm of such dialogue; but she had to occupy the  stage for a long time, and her beauty would be of value to the scenes in which  she appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is the prettiest face Courtenay has picked up for the last three years,&rdquo; said  the leader of the orchestra, who was a critic and connoisseur, and always gave  his opinion freely. &ldquo;She ought to have played Mary, instead of Miss Bolderby,  who is as old as the hills, and sings out of tune. I could have taught Miss  Morton to sing her half dozen songs in as many lessons. She has a pretty little  voice and a capital ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  can&rsquo;t act a bit,&rdquo; said Mr. Badger, &ldquo;and Bolderby is a roaring favorite with the  gallery. Morton will do very well for fairy-queen &rdquo;</p>
<p>So  Miss Morton played &ldquo;Cerulia, the queen of the azure fairies in the hyacinthe  dell&rdquo;&mdash;that is how she was described in the play-bill. The wardrobe-woman made  her a short frock of palest blue tulle, starred with silver, and a silver  tissue bodice, which fitted her willowy figure and girlish bust to perfection. She  had the prettiest legs and feet in the theater, and her satin shoes and sandals  became her to admiration. She had magnificent chestnut hair, with flashes of gold  in it, large hazel eyes, a Greek nose, and a mouth of loveliest mold. She was  delicately fashioned; of middle height, graceful, refined; altogether charming.  Mr. de Courtenay felt that he had secured a prize; and he raised her salary  from thirty shillings a week to five-and-thirty without being asked. Theatrical  salaries did not range quite so high in 1860 as they do nowadays. Under the  present liberal management of the Helmstone theater, so pretty a fairy as  Rosalie Morton would count her salary by guineas.</p>
<p>That  extra five shillings weekly was a godsend to Miss Morton and Miss Morton&rsquo;s  mamma. The mamma was a clergyman&rsquo;s widow, whose annual revenue was of the  smallest. She had a married daughter among the professional classes in  Bloomsbury; fairly, but not wealthily wedded. She had a son in Somerset House,  and another son in the colonies, working for their daily bread. And she had  this youngest of all her children&mdash; her rose of roses&mdash;who adored her, had never  been separated from her for more than a week, and who had found even a week&rsquo;s  visit to kindest friends a dreary exile from the beloved mother.</p>
<p>Rosalie  had cherished a childish passion for play-acting from the days of short frocks  and sky-blue sashes, when she had been taken to the York theater by an uncle  and aunt who lived in that cathedral city, and with whom she occasionally spent  a day and a night. The father&rsquo;s vicarage was in a rural village between York  and Beverley. Rosie had been to the theater about three times in all; but those  three nights of enchantment had made the strongest impression on her youthful  intelligence. She and her brothers acted plays in the old vicarage parlor, the  shabbiest room in the house, given over to the children, but a delightful room  for play-acting, since there were two closets and two doors, besides a  half-glass door opening into the garden. What tragedies and melodramas Rosalie  and her brothers acted in the long winter evenings! The elder sister was too  sensible and too busy to waste her time with them. She had an idea of going out  as a governess, and had her nose always in an Ollendorf.</p>
<p>Poor  little Rosie fancied herself a genius in those days. She mistook her love of  dramatic art for capacity, and thought she had only to walk on to a stage in  order to become a great actress, like the star she had seen at York. She did  not know that the star was five-and-thirty, and had worked laboriously for ten  years before audiences began to bow down to her. The vicar had been dead nearly  three years when Rosalie was seventeen, and the mother and daughter were  existing on a pittance in a dreary second floor in Guildford Street.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Melford&mdash;the girl&rsquo;s real name was Melford&mdash;was a lady by birth and education, and  had no more power of earning money than if she had been a humming-bird.</p>
<p>Rosalie  was panting to do something for the beloved mother; to bring home money and  shower it into the maternal lap. She had read of Edmund Kean&rsquo;s London <em>debut</em>, the startling success, the child  playing upon the floor of the actor&rsquo;s lodging, wallowing in gold, the guineas  having rolled in so fast that there was no one to pick them up; and she, poor  child, thought that she too was a genius, and could delight the town as Portia,  just as Kean had as Shylock. She did not recall that other tradition about the  great actor, which told how as a lad he had strutted and ranted in a booth,  learning the rudiments of his art in the rough and ready school of Richardson&rsquo;s  show, delighting the yokels at country fairs before he thrilled the <em>cognoscenti</em> at Drury Lane.</p>
<p>Much  pleading and many long discussions were needed before the mother would consent  to her child&rsquo;s appearance on the boards. The vicar&rsquo;s widow had heard terrible  stories of theaters, and she had to be reminded again and again of the glorious  examples of feminine virtue to be seen on the metropolitan stage; and that if  there were some shadows on the dramatic profession, there are also spots upon  the sun. And then they were very poor, those two, in their shabby London  lodging. They had drunk deep of the cup of genteel penury. And the mother could  but own that it would be a nice thing if her darling were earning from twenty  to thirty pounds a week at the Haymarket or the Lyceum. That dear Mr. Buckstone  would doubtless be delighted to secure this lovely young Rosalie for his  leading lady, in place of the somewhat mature personage who now filled that  position.</p>
<p>So  one morning Mrs. Melford gave her consent, and Rosalie tripped off at once to  the dramatic agent in Bow Street, and paid him five shillings by way of  entrance fee to the mysteries of the drama, and opened her heart to him. The  agent smiled at her blandly, with his eyes half shut, looking down at the toes  of his varnished boots; and then he swept away all her illusions in a sentence  or two. He told her that she would be lucky if she played Portia to a  metropolitan audience before she was forty; lucky if she got an engagement of  any kind in a London theater within the next ten years. What she had to do was  to go to some small country theater, and work hard. She would have to play  small parts for the first year or so; anything, everything, general utility;  nay, perhaps, at the first, she would have to <em>walk on</em>.</p>
<p>Rosalie  had not the least idea what the agent meant by &ldquo;walking on,&rdquo; but his manner  implied that it was something humiliating. All her high hopes had evaporated by  this time; but she was not the less eager to secure an engagement&mdash;yea, even to <em>walk on</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have a nice appearance,&rdquo; said the agent, who was too superior a person to be  rapturous about anything, and I dare say I can get you an engagement in the  country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie  had to tramp backward and forward between the Bloomsbury lodgings and Bow  Street a good many times before even this modest opening was achieved; but,  after some heart-sickening delays, the agent engaged her for the Theater Royal,  Ryde, at a salary of a pound a week. Oh, how happy poor little Rosie was when  she carried home the first pound after a week&rsquo;s drudgery! She had played a  round of the most humiliating parts in the British drama: Lady Capulet; a black  girl in &ldquo;Uncle Tom&rsquo;s Cabin;&rdquo; Maria, in the &ldquo;School for Scandal;&rdquo; she had <em>walked on</em> in a cluster of five or six  ballet-girls, supposed to represent a seething populace, or a dazzling assembly  in high life. But she had seen the footlights; she had heard the sound of her  own voice&mdash;which was more than the gallery had done &mdash;and she had earned a golden  sovereign.</p>
<p>It  must be owned that Rosalie in this state of her being was something of a stick;  but she spoke like a lady, and she was so pretty and graceful that the audience  were always pleased to see her. The good old manageress favored her, cast her  for parts that were beyond her capacity; and then came Mr. de Courtenay, of the  Helmstone theater, which ranked next best in fashion to a London house, and  Rosie was speedily transferred from the Isle of Wight to the full blaze of  Helmstone-by-the-Sea.</p>
<p>And  now all the Helmstone papers had praised the fairy Cerulia&rsquo;s beauty, and Miss  Rosalie Morton had a reception every night. It was not such a reception as  greeted Miss Bolderby, from her admirers the gods, when she came dancing on to  the stage as &ldquo;Mary, Mary, quite contrary,&rdquo; with a very short red petticoat  bedizened with silver bells, and a black velvet bodice garnished with  cockle-shells, and very <em>decolletee</em>.  Rosalie was the favorite of the stalls and the boxes. It was the young military  men from the barracks in the Brewis Road, or the Cavalry barracks in the  Castle, the Helmstone bucks, and dandies of all professions, who used to  applaud the fair girl with the brilliant hazel eyes and gentle girlish voice.  Miss Bolderby talked like a clown, and sang like a nigger minstrel.</p>
<p>There  was one young cavalry officer who used to occupy a stall at the Helmstone  theater night after night during the run of that eminently successful pantomime  of &ldquo;Gulliver and the Golden Goose.&rdquo; Miss Bolderby thought that he came  expressly to hear her sing her topical song, and see her dance her breakdown  with Mr. Powter, the low comedian who played Gulliver, afterward clown&mdash;the  clown being, of course, somebody else and not Mr. Powter. Powter thought it was  his gagging and comic singing which attracted cavalry and infantry alike, and  charmed and delighted the gallery. But Herr Hopenfeuer, the leader of the  orchestra, knew better than Powter and Bolderby, He knew that it was Rosie&rsquo;s  lovely face and sweet manner which held that nice, frank-looking young officer  spell-bound. A shrewd observer Herr Hopenfeuer, behind those blue spectacles of  his.</p>
<p>Yes,  it was Rosie whom Randolph Bosworth came night after night to see. He abhorred  Miss Bolderby and her nasal twang; he detested the irrepressible Powter. He  seemed only to live when that graceful form of the fairy-queen was before his  eyes. He drank in her smiles as if they had been wine. How sweetly she looked  as she waved her wand, with that graceful sweep of the round white arm&mdash;such a  lovely curve of the slim wrist, the drooping hand with its tapering fingers!  When she invoked the fairies to come forth from their coral caves and disport  upon the golden sands, she looked really the ethereal and immortal being she  represented&mdash;something too delicate to be of the earth, earthy. What a stalwart,  common herd the ballet-ladies looked as they came lumpily bounding from the  furthest wing, shaking the stage at every bound!</p>
<p>He  was only a lieutenant, very young, very simple-hearted, a thorough gentleman.  He was the only son of a wealthy father, and could afford to choose a wife  without reference to ways and means. He meant to marry Rosalie Morton, <em>alias</em> Melford, if she would accept him  as her husband. No other thought had ever entered his mind in relation to that  stage divinity. His mother and father would hardly like the idea of his choosing  a wife from the theater. His father was a Devonshire squire, and had all the  usual rustic prejudices, and would have liked him to marry a county heiress,  some Miss Sticktorights, whose land was conterminous with his own future  estate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  she is a good girl they will be easily reconciled to her,&rdquo; Randolph told  himself, and he contrived very soon to find out that Miss Morton was a good  girl, living with her widowed mother, as secluded as a cloistered nun.</p>
<p>Mother  and daughter went for afternoon walks in almost all weathers, but they never  appeared on the Queen&rsquo;s Parade, for the girl to be stared at or followed. They  always turned their faces to the country, and went roaming over the downs;  capital walkers both of them.</p>
<p>All  through that first month of the New Year Randolph was pining to get himself  introduced to his divinity, and knew not how to bring the matter about. If he  had been more of a man of the world he would have asked Mr. de Courtenay to  dinner and would have made an ally of the manager, who would have been glad to  help him, once assured that his views were strictly honorable. But Randolph was  only twenty-one, and was overpowered with shyness when he tried to speak of his  love. At last a happy accident seemed to favor him. He made the acquaintance of  a major in the line regiment then stationed in the Brewis Road&mdash;a mere casual  acquaintance initiated across a billiard-table. Major Disney was a man of the  world; had seen a good deal of foreign service; was nearer forty than thirty;  quite an old fogy Randolph thought him. But he was a tall, handsome fellow,  broad-shouldered, dashing, with a good manner and a fine sonorous voice:  altogether a very agreeable man. Mr. Bosworth asked him to dinner at the Old  Yacht Hotel, and they swore eternal friendship over a bottle of <em>Mouton</em>.</p>
<p>Soon  after eight o&rsquo;clock the younger man began to grow fidgety, looked at his watch,  played with his wine-glass, glanced uneasily at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  generally drop in at the little theater of an evening,&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re  doing a pantomime; not half a bad thing&mdash; almost up to a London pantomime;&rdquo; and  then, with a sudden fervor, blushing like a girl, he asked, &ldquo;Would you care to  go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,  if you like,&rdquo; answered the major, cheerily. &ldquo;Provincial pantomimes are rather  slow; in fact, I consider the whole breed of pantomimes ineffably stupid; but  one hears the children laugh, and one sees the jolly grinning shop-boys in the  pit: and that sort of thing is always refreshing. Let&rsquo;s go by all means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  kind of you!&rdquo; cried Randolph. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have liked to miss to-night.&rdquo; He  hurried on his coat, helped his friend into a heavy Inverness, and they went  off to the theater.</p>
<p>It  was a cold, snowy night, and the audience was thin. There were plenty of vacant  stalls when Randolph took his accustomed seat, just behind Herr Hopenfeuer.</p>
<p>The  major and he had not been seated five minutes before the band played the melody  to which the azure dell opened. &ldquo;Ever of thee I&rsquo;m fondly dreaming,&rdquo; and then  Rosalie came on with her pretty gliding step, and her waving arms, like a siren&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  devilish pretty girl,&rdquo; muttered the major; and the tone and the words sounded  like blasphemy in the ears of Randolph the devotee.</p>
<p>Later  on in the evening he spoke of the fairy-queen&rsquo;s beauty. &ldquo;She is like Heine&rsquo;s  Lorelei,&rdquo; he said, and then, looking at Randolph, he saw the adoring expression  in the frank blue eyes, and knew that this fisher&rsquo;s bark was in danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  speaks like a lady too,&rdquo; he went on, presently. &ldquo;Do you know who she is, and  where she comes from? She is not the common stamp of stage fairies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Randolph  imparted that information which he had gained laboriously from the stage-doorkeeper  at the cost of many half-crowns, and more than one half-sovereign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her  mother is a Mrs. Melford, you say, a Yorkshire parson&rsquo;s widow?&rdquo; exclaimed Major  Disney. &ldquo;Why, what a narrow little world this is in which we live! My eldest  sister went to school with that girls mother. Mrs. Melford was Rosa Vincent,  the daughter of old General Vincent, who died at Bath just ten years ago; a  splendid old fellow; all through the Peninsula with Wellesley, Burgoyne, and  the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know her mother?&rdquo; gasped Randolph, breathless with emotion: &ldquo;then you can  introduce me to them; you can take me to see them. I am dying to know them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to what end?&rdquo; asked the major, looking at him severely, with penetrating gray  eyes. &ldquo;She is a very pretty girl, and we both admire her. But do you think it  would be wise to carry the thing any further?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  adore her, and I mean to marry her&mdash;if she will have me,&rdquo; answered Randolph, all  in the same agitated whisper. &ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t introduce me to her I must find  some one else who will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you are sure that you mean all fair and square?&rdquo; asked the major, very  seriously. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t make love to her and propose to her, and then let your  people talk you over and persuade you to jilt her: that kind of thing has been  done, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jilt  her! not for worlds! If she will have me, I shall consider myself the luckiest  young man in England. I am an only son, you know, and I have some money of my  own, from an old aunt, that nobody can touch. I can afford to marry to-morrow,  with or without my father&rsquo;s leave. But I shall try to make things pleasant at  home; and as Miss Melford is a vicar&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;ll call upon Mrs. Melford to-morrow afternoon, and ask leave to present you  next day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  I go with you to-morrow?&rdquo; pleaded Randolph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. Remember it&rsquo;s altogether a critical business. I have to introduce myself  to the widow, whom I last saw seven-and-twenty years ago, when she was just  going to marry her parson, and when I was a mischievous young imp of eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  take her some hothouse flowers, some new books from me?&rdquo; entreated Randolph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take  them to the widow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  no&mdash;to Rosalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a fragment,&rdquo; said the stern major.</p>
<p>Poor  Randolph would have sent a truck-load of presents if he had been allowed. He  was pining to know the size of his darling&rsquo;s hand, that he might load her with  Jouvin&rsquo;s gloves. How he would have liked to buy her a seal-skin jacket, instead  of the poor little cloth garment he had seen her wear as she walked beside her  mother on the windy Downs.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Mr.  Bosworth had to languish for three dreary winter days before he was allowed to  cross the sirens threshold. Then, to his infinite delight, he was invited to  take tea with the widow and her daughter on Sunday evening. There was no such  institution as afternoon tea in that benighted age. Mrs. Melford invited the  two gentlemen to repair to her lodgings after their seven-o&rsquo;clock dinner, and  she regaled them with tea, and thin bread-and-butter, and sweet biscuits, at  half-past eight, in a neat little drawing-room within a stone&rsquo;s-throw of the  Castle, where the Enniskillens were stationed. Mr. Bosworth had not asked  permission of the severe major this time. He carried a large bouquet of  camellias and other hot-house flowers, such as those dark ages afforded, and he  offered them blushingly to the siren, so soon as he had been introduced to her.  He had the satisfaction of seeing the blossoms arranged in an old china bowl by  the fair hands of his beloved, but of speech he had but little from her; she, like  himself, being overpowered by shyness.</p>
<p>But  on the other hand, Mrs. Melford and Major Disney found plenty to say to each  other. The widow was delighted to talk of those unforgotten girlish days before  the shadow of care had crossed her horizon: her dearest friend Lucy Disney; the  finishing school in Lansdowne Crescent; the rapturous gayety of Bath &mdash;so  superior to any place she had ever known since her courtship; her last visit to  the Disneys&rsquo; fine old house in Wiltshire, when the major was a lively boy of  eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  ages ago!&rdquo; exclaimed the widow, &ldquo;and yet when I look back it seems as if it had  all happened yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  then with womanly tact, Mrs. Melford led the major on to talk of himself and of  his own career. He had not married! How strange! said the widow. He had been  through the Crimean War, and he had fought and marched under Havelock in India  the other day. In such a career there had been much that was striking, heroic  even; and without one word of self-laudation, the major told of many thrilling  adventures in which be had been concerned, while the others all hung on his  words and encouraged him by their evident interest.</p>
<p>It  was a cozy little party round the winter fire in the lodging-house  drawing-room. Rosalie sat in a corner by the fireplace, sheltered and shadowed  by her mother&rsquo;s portlier form; and from his seat on the opposite side of the  hearth, Randolph Bosworth was able to gaze at her unobserved, as she listened  almost breathlessly to the major&rsquo;s stories.</p>
<p>No,  there was no disenchantment in that nearer acquaintance with the &ldquo;Queen of the  azure dell.&rdquo; Rosalie was as lovely in this little room, between the glow of the  fire and the light of the candles, as ever she had seemed to him on the stage,  in the glare of the gas, and the glamour of the magnesium lamp. She was such a  perfect lady, too, he told himself with delight. No rouge or pearl powder  tainted the purity of her complexion. Her dark-brown merino frock and little  linen collar were exquisitely neat; her lovely tapering hands were as beautiful  as the hands in an old Italian picture. How proud he would be of her, by and  by, in the time to come! how delicious to present her to his people, to his  friends, and to say, &ldquo;This is the pearl I found unawares on the beach at  Helmstone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  heart beat high with joyous pride. He had no fear of failing in his suit, now  that he had once obtained an entrance to the siren&rsquo;s cave. He had hardly  exchanged half a dozen sentences with Miss Melford to-night, but he told  himself that he could come again to-morrow, and again and again, till he had  won her. And in the mean time he was pleased to see her hang upon Disney&rsquo;s  words: it was sweet to see a girl of nineteen so keenly interested in the  adventures of a battered old warrior.</p>
<p>He called  in Blenheim Place the next day, and the next, finding some fresh excuse for  each visit; a basket of hot-house grapes for the widow, at a season when grapes  were fourteen shillings a pound; flowers, books, music for Rosie. Mrs. Melford  protested against such lavish generosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you only knew how happy it makes me to come here&mdash;to be allowed,&rdquo; faltered the  young man; and the widow did know, and hoped that her Rosie would smile upon  the young soldier&rsquo;s suit.</p>
<p>The  major had told her all about his young friend&rsquo;s prospects, and they were both  agreed as to his goodness of heart, his high moral character, and that he would  be a splendid match for Rosie. The widow&rsquo;s heart thrilled at the thought that  her youngest and best beloved child might secure to herself such a happy  future. In her day-dreams she ruthlessly made away with old Squire Bosworth,  who had never done her any harm. She brushed him out of existence as if be had  been a withered leaf, so that Rosie should reign sole mistress of Bosworth  Manor.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Melford and the major put their heads together like a couple of hardened old  match-makers, and planned the marriage of the young people; the major with a  somewhat mournful air, as of a man who had known heart-wounds, whose part in  life was renunciation. Mrs. Melford thought him very kind, but regretted that  he was not more cheerful.</p>
<p>When  the time came for the mother to talk to her daughter, there was bitter  disappointment. Rosalie was as cold as ice at the mention of her lover&rsquo;s name.  She declared that she meant never to marry; at least she thought not. She was  quite happy with her mother; she liked her profession; in a word she did not  care a straw for Randolph Bosworth. She admitted his manifold virtues, his  kindness, his chivalry. The widow put forward his claims, item by item; those  grapes at fourteen shillings a pound; that lovely copy of the &ldquo;Idyls,&rdquo; bound in  vellum; the flowers that transformed their shabby lodging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you would have such things all your life, Rosie. You would have a grand old  country house, with twenty-two bedrooms&mdash;he admitted that there are twenty-two  bedrooms at the Manor, without counting servants&rsquo; rooms&mdash;and you would have  carriages and horses. I used to dream of such a life for my darling, but I  never thought to see my dream realized; so quickly too, while my pet is in the  first bloom of her beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  nonsense you talk, mother dear!&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;Captain Bosworth has never  asked me to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  love; but he has asked me, and he means positively to ask you, by and by, if  you will only give him a little encouragement. He adores you, Rosie, that dear  young man. He adored you at first sight. Don&rsquo;t make light of such a love, dear.  You are very pretty, and will have plenty of admirers as you go through life;  but true love is not a flower that grows in every hedge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  mother, it&rsquo;s no use talking,&rdquo; pleaded Rosie, half crying. &ldquo;I know how good  Captain Bosworth is, but&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t care for him, and you wouldn&rsquo;t have me  marry a man I don&rsquo;t love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try  to love him, Rosie,&rdquo; urged the mother. &ldquo;Only try, dear, and the love will  come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosalie  shook her head, and gave a low, long sigh; a sigh which might have told a great  deal to a shrewder woman than the widow; but Mrs. Melford had not a penetrating  mind.</p>
<p>To  please the match-making mother Rosalie was very polite and agreeable to the  young officer when he called at Blenheim Place. She was particularly grateful  for the lovely copy of the &ldquo;Idyls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is reading it day and night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Melford. &ldquo;I never knew a girl so  devoted to a book of poems. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Tennyson ought to be flattered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  would be if he knew,&rdquo; murmured Randolph, fatuously, gazing at Rosalie as if she  had been a saint.</p>
<p>He  asked her which character she most admired in the &ldquo;Idyls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  Launcelot,&rdquo; she answered, clasping her hands and looking up at an imaginary  knight, with just the same radiant enthusiasm as might have shone upon the face  of the Lily-maid when she worshiped the real Launcelot.</p>
<p>Major  Disney was announced at this moment, and the girl flushed crimson; no doubt  because he had broken the spell.</p>
<p>The  pantomime season was waning fast, and the Theater Royal, Helmstone, would  shortly close. There was a talk of Charles Mathews on a starring engagement  after the pantomime, and then the theater must inevitably be shut, and Rosalie would  have to earn her bread elsewhere. Lovely as she was, no eager London manager  had offered to engage her. Perhaps the London managers saw that Rosalie&rsquo;s gamut  hardly went beyond the fairy-queen line of business; and fairies are only  wanted at Christmas-tide. Rosalie&rsquo;s brightest prospect was an engagement at  Coketown, in the North, to play first walking lady, and that line of business  includes some of the most intolerable parts in the British drama&mdash;ay, even Lady  Capulet and Sheridan&rsquo;s Maria.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Melford began to be very anxious. Captain Bosworth had been all patience and  devotion. He had endured Rosalie&rsquo;s coldness; he had waited for the dawn of  hope. But patience cannot last forever, and the widow felt that this splendid  chance must soon be lost unless Rosie relented. She had all manner of little  schemes for bringing about <em>tete-a-tetes</em> between the lovers, but so far nothing had come of the <em>tete-a-tetes</em> so planned. She had come back to the little  drawing-room after a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s seemingly enforced absence to find  Rosalie and the soldier sitting on opposite sides of the hearth, as prim and as  cold as two china figures. There are some young men who cannot propose in cold  blood.</p>
<p>One  afternoon&mdash;a bleak February afternoon, the earth iron-bound with a black frost,  the sky leaden, the sea a livid hue&mdash; Mrs. Melford proposed a long walk on the  Downs. Rosie had been complaining of a headache, she said&mdash;nothing so good as a  walk to cure a headache. Perhaps Captain Bosworth would like to join them.</p>
<p>Captain  Bosworth would have liked to go to Siberia under the same conditions. He  snapped at the offer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  adore those Downs,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>But  Rosalie did not want to walk. She was tired; she had the third volume of a  novel that she was dying to finish. She made at least half a dozen excuses.  Major Disney was announced just at that moment, and the mother appealed to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  not a long walk the very best thing for Rosie&rsquo;s headache?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course it is,&rdquo; answered the major, &ldquo;and Miss Melford must obey her mother. We will  all go. I have been writing letters all the morning, and am sadly in want of  oxygen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosie  went off to put on her hat and jacket as meekly as a lamb. It was nearly three  o&rsquo;clock when they started, two and two, Randolph and Rosie in the van, Mrs.  Melford and the major in the rear. Just on the opposite side of the gardens in  front of Blenheim Place there is a narrow little street almost as steep as the  side of a house&mdash;a shabby ragamuffin of a street, but it leads straight up to  the purity and freshness of the Downs, just as Jacob&rsquo;s ladder led to heaven.</p>
<p>Randolph  and Rosie tripped lightly up that Mont Blanc of Helmstone, but they found very  little to say to each other on the way. The major and the widow followed at a  good pace, she lamenting Rosalie&rsquo;s folly, and pouring her maternal griefs into  the bosom of her friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is certainly very strange that she should not care for him,&rdquo; admitted the  major, &ldquo;for he really is a capital fellow&mdash;handsome, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  young, and rich,&rdquo; urged the widow. &ldquo;It is absolute perversity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  you think there is any one else she cares for?&rdquo; inquired the major, after a  pause.</p>
<p>He  spoke with some hesitation, almost falteringly, as if he hardly dared to shape  the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear major, who else should there be? Think what a child Rosalie is! We were  buried alive for the three years after her father&rsquo;s death, and she never saw a  mortal except my son-in-law, Mr. Bignell, who is about as plain a young man as  I ever met. And since she went on the stage the only gentlemen who have crossed  our threshold are yourself and Captain Bosworth. I call it sheer perversity,&rdquo;  concluded the widow, with an aggrieved air.</p>
<p>The  Downs were delightful on that keen winter afternoon. Such bracing air&mdash;bracing  yet not too bitter; the breath of the sea seemed to temper the north-easter.  And how glorious the sea looked from that airy height; and how white and clean  and glittering that dear old Helmstone, which everybody loves&mdash;ay, even those  who pretend to loathe it.</p>
<p>Rosie&rsquo;s  spirits rose as she tripped over the turf and let the wind buffet her. There  was no more walking two and two. Major Disney was at her side now, and he and  she were talking gayly enough. Her spirits grew almost wild with delight in the  wind and sea. &ldquo;Let us have a race,&rdquo; she cried, and flew off like Atalanta, the  two officers running on either side of her, careful to adjust their pace to  hers, till she stopped breathless and laughing at her own folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  lovely it is up here!&rdquo; she said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  we&rsquo;re not careful we may have to stay here all night!&rdquo; cried the major; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  a sea-fog coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  was right. Drifting across from the ocean there came a great white cloud, which  began to wrap them round like a dense veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We  had better get back as quickly as we can,&rdquo; said the major. &ldquo;Take my arm, Miss  Melford, and double quick march.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  Rosalie took his arm without a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run  on and look after Mrs. Melford,&rdquo; said the major; and Randolph obeyed, hastening  to rejoin the distant figure in the midst of the white cloud. He thought it was  not a little unkind of his friend to order him off upon outpost duty, when he  might have turned the sea-fog and the lonely height to such good account with  his divinity. He felt that he should have had pluck enough to propose to her  under cover of that sea-fog. He was still very far from understanding how the  land really lay.</p>
<p>He  steered Mrs. Melford homeward very skillfully; but Rosie and her guide were an hour  later in their return, and Mrs. Melford was devoured by two several  apprehensions. First, that her darling should be lost altogether&mdash;frozen to  death on those windy Downs, or crushed at the bottom of a chalk-pit; secondly,  that she should not be home in time to play her part in &ldquo;Harlequin Gulliver and  the Goose with the Golden Eggs.&rdquo; She and Captain Bosworth sat staring at the  little clock on the chimney-piece and counting the minutes till a cab dashed up  to the door, and she heard her child&rsquo;s voice, silver-sweet, in the hall below.</p>
<p>Yes,  Rosie and the major had lost themselves upon the misty Downs; they had lost  themselves, and had found bliss unspeakable, the beginning of a new life, the  threshold of an earthly paradise, as it seemed to both. They had wandered ever  so far from Helmstone in that dream of bliss, and had found their way back to  the furthest end of the East Cliff, where they luckily encountered a strolling  fly, which rattled them gayly to Blenheim Place.</p>
<p>Rosie  threw herself into her mother&rsquo;s arms in the little passage and sobbed out her  bliss:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  mother, I am so proud, so happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  a new&rsquo; light dawned upon Mrs. Melford as she saw the major&rsquo;s radiant smile. She  gave him her hand without a word. It was a very poor match for Rosie compared  with that other marriage which the girl might have made. But George Disney was  a soldier and a gentleman&mdash;almost a hero&mdash;and Mrs. Melford liked him.</p>
<p>Randolph  Bosworth accepted his defeat nobly, although he was very hard hit&mdash;as near  broken-hearted as a man well can be. He bade Rosie and her mother good-bye next  morning, and in his brief interview with the girl he told her how he had loved  her from the first moment in which her beauty shone upon him across the  Helmstone foot-lights; how he should cherish her image until the end of his  life; how he never could care for any one else. And then tenderly, gently,  bravely, he bade her goodbye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me kiss you once,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let me have something to remember when I am far  away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  turned her face to him without a word, as simply as a child to a father, and he  kissed the pure young brow. It was the kiss of chivalry and high feeling, the  pledge of a life-long devotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  ever you need a friend in the days to come, remember me,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;to the last  coin in my purse, to the last drop of my blood, I am your servant&mdash;your slave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  so they parted, Rosalie deeply moved by his devotion. He contrived to get away  on leave a few days afterward, and went to Ireland to shoot wild-duck, and  before Rosalie&rsquo;s wedding-day he and the Enniskillens had sailed for India, one  of the first regiments to be ordered there under the new dispensation.</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h2>
<p>It  was the Christmas-tide of 1880, and dear old Helmstone had become Helmstone the  new, Helmstone the smart, Helmstone in a state of daily and hourly development.  The new pier, the aquarium, the tramway, the monster hotel, the colossal  club-house, the new theater were all established facts. The Helmstone of &rsquo;58  and &rsquo;59, the Helmstone which Thackeray praised and Leech and Doyle drew, was a  place to be remembered by old fogies and regretted by middle-aged matrons, who  had spent the gayest, brightest hours of their girlhood prancing up and down  the Queen&rsquo;s Parade.</p>
<p>Among  those fogies who regretted the days that were gone was a military-looking man  who sat at his solitary meal in one of the bow-windows of the Old Yacht Hotel,  there where the wind-lashed surges seemed almost to break against the doorstep,  so high rose the waves above the sea-wall. It was a blusterous evening just  after Christmas, and the soldierly person yonder had only arrived at Helmstone  by the four o&rsquo;clock express from Victoria.</p>
<p>He  was bronzed by tropical skies, and he had the look of a man who had been long  upon foreign service. He was about forty, tall, broad-shouldered, good-looking,  with frank blue eyes, and a kindly smile when he spoke. But the expression of  his face in repose was grave almost to sadness. He sighed as he glanced round  the old-fashioned coffee-room, where three or four solitary diners, like  himself, were dotted about at the neat little tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  house is very little changed within the last twenty years,&rdquo; he said to the  waiter, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  sir; we are an old-fashioned house, sir. I don&rsquo;t think any of our friends would  like to see anything altered here. Our house is about the only thing in  Helmstone that has not changed during the last twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed.  I thought, as I drove from the station, that the town looked much larger. But  you seem to have increased in a perpendicular direction. All your houses and  streets have gone up into the skies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  we are limited in space, sir, we mount,&rdquo; said the head-waiter, who was a  superior personage, quite equal to any discussion; &ldquo;but when you go westward  to-morrow, you will see how we can spread. You will find a city of palaces  where there used to be a cricket-field.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  said the soldier, with an absent air.</p>
<p>His  eyes had wandered to a play-bill hanging against the wall by the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have your theater, still, I see,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the same old theater, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  dear no, sir; we have had a new theater for the last ten years. Very fine  theater, sir. Very well patronized. Pantomime just out. Very good pantomime.  Harlequin Robinson Crusoe. Old Mother Shipton, and the Little Old Woman who  Lived in a Shoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  soldier sighed, as if at some sad memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  usual kind of thing, no doubt,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and there are fairies, I suppose, and  dances, and a fairy queen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes, sir, there is a first-class fairy scene. The Ruby Glade in the Sunset  Glen, and there is a fairy queen, and a very pretty girl she is too. I don&rsquo;t  remember ever seeing a prettier girl on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  sighed the officer, &ldquo;perhaps you were not in Helmstone twenty years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No  sir,&rdquo; replied the waiter, with a superior smile, which implied that he was  hardly out of his mother&rsquo;s arms at that period.</p>
<p>The  waiter whisked the last crumb off the table-cloth and left the soldier in  silent contemplation of a dish of walnuts and a claret jug.</p>
<p>So  there was a pantomime being acted in these latter days, thought Colonel  Bosworth, and there were fairies, and dances, and tinseled groves, and sham water-falls,  and the glamour of colored lights, and gay music, just as there had been twenty  years ago, when he was a young man, and lost his heart in that little theater  at Helmstone&mdash;a youngster, an untried soldier, almost a boy&mdash;and yet very  steadfast, very certain of himself, in that first real passion of his life.</p>
<p>He  had not overestimated his constancy in those days. When he told Rosalie Melford  that he could never care for any other woman, he had made an assertion which  after-events had warranted. He had seen much of life since that time. He had  seen hard service in India, had marched with Napier in Abyssinia, and had  fought with Wolseley in Ashante. He had been courted and thought much of in  London society during his brief intervals of foreign service; hunted by  match-making mothers, who knew the number of his acres and the excellence of  his moral character; but not once during those twenty years had Randolph  Bosworth yielded to the fascinations of the fair sex. The one beautiful face  which had been the star of his youth was his only ideal of womanly loveliness.  He had never met any woman who resembled Rosalie Melford; and he told himself  that until he should meet such a one he was secure from all the pains and  perils which spring of womankind. He was like a man under a spell.</p>
<p>And  in all those years he had heard hardly anything of his lost love. The major had  married her directly after Easter, and had carried her off to Canada with his  regiment. Six years afterward Disney was stationed at the Cape, and no doubt  Rosalie was with him there; and then Randolph heard that he had retired on  half-pay, and that he was living with his wife and family in some  out-of-the-way Welsh village, a rustic nook hidden among the hills. Randolph  would have given much to know more about his darling&rsquo;s fate&mdash;whether she was  happy: whether the major was comfortably off&mdash;but he had a delicacy in intruding  himself upon them in any manner; and then so much of his own life was spent far  away. He thought that if Rosalie were in need of a friend&rsquo;s help, she would be  sure to appeal to him.</p>
<p>He  sat and sipped his claret for half an hour or so in a dreamy mood, the very  sound of the surges recalling old thoughts, old fancies, the old hopes which  had been so cruelly disappointed, and then he got up and put on his hat and  overcoat, and went to the theater.</p>
<p>He  was courting the tender, half sweet, half painful memories which beset him in  this familiar place. Yes, he would go to the theater. It was not the same  theater, but it stood on the same spot; and the lights, and the music, and the  girlish faces would help to recall those old feelings which were to him as a  cherished dream.</p>
<p>The  new theater was much larger and handsomer than the funny little old house with  its stage doors, and its old-fashioned proscenium, audits suggestions of Mr. Vincent  Crummies and Miss Snevellicci It had a more metropolitan air, and was better  filled than the old house. The pantomime had begun when the bronzed and bearded  soldier took his seat in a corner of the stalls. There had been a dark scene in  which Mother Shipton and a congress of witches had been interviewed by Crusoe;  and now that bold mariner was tossing on the southern ocean in imminent danger  of shipwreck from the huge canvas waves which were flapping against his wicker  keel, and raising more dust than one would expect to meet with in mid-ocean;  and the next scene, as per bill, would be the Ruby Glade in the Sunset Glen,  and Diaphanosia, the queen of the water-nymphs, would appear with her fairy  court; and Senora Nina Ninez, of the Theater Royal, Covent Garden, would dance  her renowned <em>caehuca</em>.</p>
<p>Colonel  Bosworth wondered what kind of prettiness that would be which the head-waiter  at the Yacht had praised. A vulgar, trivial beauty, no doubt; as different from  Rosalie Melford&rsquo;s poetic loveliness as a double dahlia from a wild rose.</p>
<p>The  scene representing a dark, storm-tossed ocean was rolled slowly upward,  revealing the Sunset Glen, a glow of rosy light, and sparkling coral, and  golden sand, and a background of ultra-marine wavelets. The band played a  tender melody&mdash;not that old, old ballad, &ldquo;Ever of thee,&rdquo; which the soldier  remembered so well. It was a newer strain by Sullivan, a song with a waltz  refrain, &ldquo;Sweethearts.&rdquo; And to the rhythm of the waltz some fifteen or twenty  water-nymphs came gliding on to the stage, and after the water-nymphs their  queen, with a single star shining on her fair young brow.</p>
<p>Was  he mad or dreaming? Was his trip to Helmstone, this scene in the theater, all a  foolish dream, and would he awake presently in his bedroom at the British  Hotel, and hear the London cabs and &rsquo;buses grinding over the stones of Cockspur  Street? This was what Randolph Bosworth asked himself as Diaphanosia came  slowly forward in the rosy glow, waving her wand with slim round arm, whose  graceful curve he remembered so well.</p>
<p>Surely  it must be a dream: or time in Helmstone had been standing still for the last  twenty years. The fairy of to-night was the fairy of twenty years ago, Rosalie  Melford, unchanged, as it seemed to him, since the hour in which his boyish  heart first went out to her. And now he was a grave, middle-aged man; yet, as  he gazed at the sweet face, with its classic outline and alabaster purity of  tint, his heart beat as passionately as it had beaten twenty years ago.</p>
<p>He  looked at his programme, tried to collect his senses, to convince himself that  he was not dreaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diaphanosia:  Miss R. Morton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes;  it was the old name even. And, it was she herself, the woman he had loved for  twenty years of his life&mdash;for half his lifetime. He knew every tone of that  voice which had been as music in the days gone by. He remembered every movement  of the graceful figure, the carriage of the head&mdash;every turn, every look.</p>
<p>He  sat gazing at her, breathless almost, with all his soul in his eyes. But she  gave no sign of having seen or recognized him. She went through her part  graciously, with a refined elegance which was altogether charming, and which  just suited the colorless, passionless character. So might Titania herself have  looked and moved, an ethereal being, free from all taint and stain of human  nature. He stayed till the transformation scene, patiently enduring the  buffooneries of Crusoe, and the street-boy twang of the lady who played  Crusoe&rsquo;s young woman, and who was evidently the idol of the gallery, just as  Miss Bolderby had been twenty years before. He waited and watched, greedily  expectant of Diaphanosia&rsquo;s reappearances, which were of the briefest, and it  was not until she had changed Crusoe into clown, and condemned a villainous  sailor to the expiatory infamy of pantaloon; it was not until the golden temple  and the peacock throne of dazzling gems had been abruptly extinguished by a  pork-butcher&rsquo;s shop in the front grooves, that the colonel rose from his seat,  and left the auditorium.</p>
<p>He  did not go back to the Old Yacht, but he groped his way along a dark passage  which he had known of old, and planted himself close beside the stage door.  There was a little stone yard of about ten feet square at the end of the  passage, and here he could lurk unobserved.</p>
<p>He  had lurked on that spot many a night in that winter of I860, and had waited  patiently, just for the brief joy of seeing his beloved go swiftly past him by  her mother&rsquo;s side, two dark figures, thickly shawled and closely veiled,  obscure as phantoms in the somber passage.</p>
<p>To-night  he was bolder, and meant to accost his old love when she came out of the stage  door, to claim the privilege of friendship, and to learn what sad reverses had  brought her back to that stage. He did not for a moment believe that it was  idle vanity which had impelled her to such a reappearance.</p>
<p>She  came out of the door sooner than he had hoped, a tall, slim figure, neatly  dressed in black. She wore a cloth jacket, such as he remembered her wearing  twenty years before, and a small black straw hat, which fitted close to her  head, and left the delicate profile unshadowed.</p>
<p>He  came forward bareheaded to greet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope you have not forgotten me in all these years, Mrs. Disney,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My  name is Bosworth&mdash;Randolph Bosworth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten  you! no, indeed! How could I forget any one who was so kind to my dear mother  and me?&rdquo; she faltered: and he knew from the tone in which she spoke her  mother&rsquo;s name that Mrs. Melford was dead. &ldquo;I have never forgotten you. Only I  should hardly have known you just at first, and in this dark passage, if you  had not told me your name. You are much altered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you not at all,&rdquo; he answered, tenderly. &ldquo;It seems miraculous to me to find you  after twenty years, as young, as beautiful as when I saw you first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do not know what you are talking about,&rdquo; she answered, laughing a little at his  enthusiasm. &ldquo;You have only seen me across the foot-lights. I shall be  nine-and-thirty next week, and I am very old for my age. I have seen so much  trouble in the last six years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have had trouble, and you never told me. Then you forgot my parting prayer,&rdquo;  said Randolph, reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  I did not forget those kind words of yours. But my chief sorrow was beyond  human aid. My dear husband&rsquo;s health broke down; mental and bodily health both  gave way. I nursed him for three years, and in all that time he only knew me  once &mdash;for the last few minutes before he died. Till just that last ray of light  his mind had been a blank. It was a sunstroke which he got at the Cape. We  brought him home an invalid, and settled in a little out-of-the-way nook in  Wales, He was fitful and strange in those days, but we hoped that he was  gradually recovering. But he grew worse as time went on, and the doctors  discovered that the brain was fatally injured. The last three years were  terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  gave a stifled sob at the recollection, and Colonel Bosworth could find no word  of comfort for such a grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo;  she said, offering him her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  me see you home,&rdquo; he pleaded; &ldquo;I want to know more. Let me walk as far as your  lodgings. Are they in the old place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  we are not in such a nice neighborhood as Blenheim place; and it is further  from the theater. I am afraid I shall be taking you too far out of your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know that I would walk with you to the end of the world,&rdquo; he said, quietly; and  she made no further objection.</p>
<p>It  was such a new thing to her to hear a friend&rsquo;s voice, and this was a voice out  of the old time, when she had been young and happy.</p>
<p>They  had walked away from the theater, and the cabs, and lights, and the crowd by  this time; and they were in a wide, dark street leading to Prince&rsquo;s Square, and  the sea, and the old-fashioned hotels: stately old houses still extant in this  older part of Helmstone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  spoke just now as if you were not alone here,&rdquo; hazarded Colonel Bosworth,  presently; &ldquo;have you any of&mdash;of&mdash;your family with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  spoke in fear and trembling. He had seen the announcement of a child&rsquo;s birth  long ago in the <em>Times</em>, but the child  might have died an infant for all he knew. Mrs. Disney might be a childless  widow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have them both with me. My boy and girl are both here,&rdquo; she answered frankly. &ldquo;It  is a dull life for them, poor children, but they are such a comfort to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you mind telling me what train of circumstances led to your coming back to  Helmstone to act?&rdquo; he asked, presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is easily told,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;When my dear husband died we were left very  poor. His terrible illness had swallowed up all our money. There was nothing  but my small pension, and I had my two children to provide for. People advised  me to go out as a governess, but I am not accomplished enough to earn a large  salary in these days when everybody is so clever; and I could not bear the idea  of parting from my children. I tried to get employment as a morning governess,  and after waiting a long time and spending two or three pounds on  advertisements, a lady at Kensington was kind enough to engage me to teach her  five children, from half-past nine to half-past one, for a guinea a week. I  believe she considered it a rather handsome salary, as I could only teach  English, French, Italian, music, singing, and drawing, while what she most  wanted for her children was German, the only thing I could not teach them. So I  was only a <em>pis aller</em>, you see. It was  very hard work, and I was getting dreadfully tired of it last November, when I  happened to meet Mrs. de Courtenay, the widow of my former manager. She  recognized me directly&mdash;I believe I have altered rather less in twenty years  than people usually do&mdash;and she asked me what I was doing. She is the kindest  woman in the world, and when she heard how I had toiled for a guinea a week,  she declared she must find me something better than that, and a few days afterward  I received a letter from her asking me to play my old part of fairy queen at a  salary of four guineas a week. My darlings and I were so rejoiced at this good  fortune. It seemed like finding a gold mine. We hurried down here directly my  Kensington lady set me free; and my children and I have been as happy as birds  in this dear old place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am deeply wounded to find how slight a value you put upon friendship, Mrs.  Disney,&rdquo; said Colonel Bosworth, gravely. &ldquo;If you had ever considered me your  friend, surely you would have let me come to your aid when your natural  protector was taken from you. You knew that I was rich, alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  would you have thought of a woman who could take advantage of a boyish fancy&mdash;a  dream of twenty years old?&rdquo; murmured Rosalie. &ldquo;I had my own battle to fight, my  children to work for. I was not afraid of poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was ungenerous to deprive me of the happiness I should have felt in being  useful to you&mdash;and to your children,&rdquo; replied Bosworth, earnestly.</p>
<p>His  tones faltered a little when he came to speak of her children. He could not  picture her to himself as a widow and a mother. To him she was still the fairy  of his youth&mdash;his &ldquo;phantom of delight&rdquo;&mdash;the ethereal vision, the ideal of his  boyish dream. They had crossed Prince&rsquo;s Square, and they were on the broad  parade that ascends the East Cliff. A full moon was shining on the sea and the  town, steeping all things in a clear and silvery light, and in this soft light  Rosalie&rsquo;s beauty seemed to have lost none of its youthful charm. There were  lines perhaps; the gazelle-like eyes were hollower, the oval of the cheek was  pinched a little toward the delicately rounded chin. There must needs have been  some markings of advancing years in the face of this woman whose nine-and-thirtieth  birthday was so near. But to Randolph Bosworth the face was as beautiful as of  old&mdash;the woman was no less dear than of old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is not a dream of twenty years old,&rdquo; he said, after a long pause, repeating her  own words. &ldquo;My love for you was a reality then, and is a reality now. It has  been the one great reality of my life. Give me some reward for my  steadfastness, Rosalie. I claim no other merit; but I have at least been  steadfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  cannot be in earnest, she said. &ldquo;I am an old woman. The last ten years of my  life count double, they have been so full of sorrow. All my hopes of happiness  are centered in my children. I live for them, and for them alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Rosalie, you are too young for all womanly feeling, all personal ambition to be  extinguished in you. Twenty years ago I was at your feet&mdash;young, prosperous,  devoted to you. I thought then that I could have made your life happy; your  mother thought so too. But it was not to be. You chose an older and a poorer  man. Granted that he was worthy of your love&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  was more than worthy,&rdquo; interjected Rosalie; &ldquo;I am proud of having loved him. I  was his fond and happy wife till calamity came upon us. I was his loving wife  till death parted us. I have never regretted my choice, Colonel Bosworth. If I  had to live my life over again I would be George Disney&rsquo;s wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will not be jealous of his shade,&rdquo; said Bosworth. &ldquo;Providence has dealt  strangely with us both, Rosalie. Fate has parted us for twenty years only to  bring us together again, both free, both lonely. Why should I not win the prize  now which I lost then? I could make your fate, and the fate of your children,  happier than it is. I could indeed. Rosalie, Houses and lands are gross and  sordid things perhaps, but some part of man&rsquo;s happiness depends upon them.  Bosworth Manor is still waiting for its mistress. It shall wait until you go  there. Do you remember that picture of the old house which I brought you one  day, and which your mother admired so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  poor mother, yes, she was so fond of you. No, Colonel Bosworth, no, it cannot  be. I should be the weakest of women if I were to accept your generous offer. I  honor you for having made such an offer; I feel myself honored by it. But I am  an old woman. It is all very well for me to play fairy-queen, and to pretend to  be a girl again, in order to earn four guineas a week. That means bread for my children;  and if there is anything ridiculous in the business, I can afford to ignore it  for their sakes. But I cannot forget that I am twenty years older than when you  first knew me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  am I not twenty years older, Rosalie?&rdquo; asked her lover eagerly. &ldquo;Do you suppose  that time has been kinder to me than it has to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Age  does not count with a man. You may find a girl of nineteen who will worship  you, just as I worshiped George Disney, loving him for his heroic acts, for the  charm of his conversation, for so many qualities which had nothing to do with  his age. Why should you choose an old and faded woman, a widow, the mother of  grown-up children?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only  because she is the one woman upon earth whom I love,&rdquo; answered Bosworth. &ldquo;Come,  Rosalie, I will not be too importunate. I will not ask you to accept me  to-night. I come back to you after twenty years almost as a stranger. Let me be  your friend, let me come and see you now and then, as I used in Blenheim Place;  and by the time the pantomime season is over you will have discovered whether I  am worthy to be loved, whether I am an impostor when I pretend that I can make  your life happier than it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  all my heart,&rdquo; said Rosalie, with a sigh of relief; &ldquo;Heaven knows we have need  of a friend, my children and I. We are quite alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Anxious  though he was to please her, Colonel Bosworth could not bring himself to speak  of her children yet awhile. Struggle as he might against a feeling which he  deemed unworthy, the idea jarred upon him; there was an instinctive repugnance  to the thought of Rosalie&rsquo;s love for George Disney&rsquo;s children.</p>
<p>They  had arrived at the street in which Mrs. Disney lived. It was the narrowest  street in the East Cliff, an old, old street, built in those remote ages when  Helmstone began to develop from a fishing village to a fashionable watering-place.  The old bow-fronted houses were very small and rather shabby; but that in which  Mrs. Disney had taken up her abode was neat and clean-looking, and there were  some tamarisk plants in front of the parlor window by way of decoration.</p>
<p>Colonel  Bosworth and the widow shook hands on the doorstep. The door was opened before  Mrs. Disney had time to knock or ring, and a bright, frank-faced lad welcomed  the mother&rsquo;s return. The colonel walked slowly away as the door closed upon  mother and son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  nice gentleman-like boy,&rdquo; he thought, beginning to reconcile himself to his  future position as this bright-eyed lad&rsquo;s stepfather: and then, after five  minutes&rsquo; musing, he said to himself, &ldquo;No doubt I could get him an Indian  appointment through General So-and-so. I wonder if he has any taste for  forestry?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * *</p>
<p>Colonel  Bosworth spent a sleepless night in his cozy bedchamber at the Old Yacht. He  lay broad awake, listening to the sad sea waves, which had nothing better to do  all that night than to talk about Rosalie. Yes, it was a strange fatality which  had brought him back to that place to find his old love there. How beautiful  she had looked in the moonlight! Her countenance was more pensive; but it was  even lovelier than of yore&mdash; spiritualized; the expression more thoughtful, more  intense.</p>
<p>He  counted the hours next day until it would be decent to call, and at three  o&rsquo;clock he turned the corner of the narrow street and knocked at Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s  door. He had employed part of his morning in choosing new books and hot-house  flowers to send to his divinity. When the door was opened, the house smelt of  hyacinths and jonquils. A neat little slavey admitted him and ushered him into  the front parlor immediately, feebly murmuring her own particular reading of  his name&mdash; Colonel Gosswith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosalie!&rdquo;  he exclaimed, bending over the girlish figure that rose hastily from a seat in  front of the window. &ldquo;No, the moonlight did not deceive me. You are lovelier,  younger looking than when we first met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  sweet face&mdash;Rosalie&rsquo;s face, and yet not quite Rosalie&rsquo;s&mdash; looked at him with a  bewildered air; fair girlish cheeks crimsoned beneath his ardent gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think you mistake me for my mother, Colonel Bosworth,&rdquo; faltered those lovely  lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am Rosa; mother is Rosalie. She looks so wonderfully young that we are often  mistaken for sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  was it you whom I saw at the theater last night?&rdquo; exclaimed the colonel,  beginning to lose his balance altogether, feeling that he must be going mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No;  that was mother,&rdquo; answered the girl, simply. &ldquo;She will be here directly. She  has been helping my brother with his French. He is capital for Greek and Latin,  you know,&rdquo; which the colonel did not, &ldquo;but he is not so good at French, and  mother helps him. How kind of you to send us those exquisite flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was a great pleasure to me to send them. I knew your mother twenty years ago,  Miss Disney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh  yes; we feel as if you were quite an old friend. Mother has so often talked  about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  she had cared a jot for me she would never have breathed my name,&rdquo; thought the  colonel.</p>
<p>He  felt humiliated by the idea that he had been trotted out for the amusement of  these children, in the character of a rejected swain. And then he looked at Rosa  Disney and tried to reconcile himself with the idea of her as his  step-daughter. Surely there could be nothing nicer in the way of step-daughter.</p>
<p>Yes,  it was a lovely face, lovelier even than Rosalie&rsquo;s in her bloom of youth, if  there could be lovelier than the loveliest. Colonel Bosworth wanted a new form  of superlative to express this younger beauty.</p>
<p>There  was a higher intellectuality in the face, he thought&mdash;a touch, too, of patrician  loftiness, which came from the larger mind, the older lineage of the father. A  most interesting girl, and so meekly unconscious of her own charms.</p>
<p>One  of the new books was lying open on the table, Browning&rsquo;s last poem; Rosa had  been devouring it, and she and the colonel were discussing it in a very  animated way, unconscious that they had been talking nearly half an hour, when  Mrs. Disney came into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  silly servant has only just told me you were here,&rdquo; said the widow. &ldquo;I see you  have made friends with Rosa already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  had need make friends with her if she is to be my stepdaughter,&rdquo; thought  Colonel Bosworth, ruefully.</p>
<p>He  looked at his old love gently, tenderly, in the cold, prosaic light of a  December afternoon! Yes, time had been lenient, very lenient, to the fair and  classic beauty. The delicate Grecian nose, the perfect modeling of mouth and  chin, these were as lovely as of old. But ah! how wide was the gulf between  Rosa in the bloom of her girlish freshness and Rosalie after her twenty years  of changes and chances, joys and sorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  was right,&rdquo; thought Randolph; &ldquo;time and sorrow must always tell their tale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  visit was a long one, for he stayed to take tea with the little household. He  made friends with his future step-son&mdash;talked about India and forestry, and he  escorted Mrs. Disney to the stage door before he went to his dinner. He asked  permission to see her home after the performance; but this was refused.</p>
<p>He  did not go to the theater that night. He told himself that he did not want to  vulgarize his impressions of the Fairy Diaphanosia. He wished to cherish her  image as it had flashed upon him last night, a sweet surprise.</p>
<p>He  sat by the cozy fire at the Old Yacht, reading Browning and thinking of Rosa;  he wanted to accustom himself to the idea of a step-daughter.</p>
<p>Next  day was bright and sunny, and Colonel Bosworth went for a walk on the new pier,  where he met George and Rosa, his future step-children. They did the pier  thoroughly together, and at George&rsquo;s instigation went to see a Pink  Tortoise-shell Cat, the Industrious Fleas, and a cockle-shell boat, which had  brought some adventurous souls across the Atlantic, each of these wonders being  severally on view at threepence a head. The colonel vowed that it was the  pleasantest morning he had spent for years. He was charmed with the pink cat,  though its pinkness was only in the proportion of about five per cent, of its  normal hue.</p>
<p>Although  Colonel Bosworth only parted from his future stepchildren at the corner of the  narrow street on the East Cliff at half-past one, he was at Mrs. Disney&rsquo;s door  soon after three, and again he spent the afternoon in the little bow-windowed  parlor, talking with Rosa and her brother, while the widow sat by the fire  working a grand design in crewels on a sage-green curtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  that to be hung up at Bosworth Manor by and by?&rdquo; asked Randolph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you like,&rdquo; she answered, sweetly; and it seemed to him that in those simple  words there was an acceptance of his offer. The threads of their two lives were  to be interwoven, like the woof and warp of that curtain.</p>
<p>He  was not so elated at his victory as he would have felt the night before last,  when he pleaded his cause on the Cliff in the glamour of the moonlight. He was  sober as became a man with new responsibilities, a man who was so soon to be a  step-father. He stayed to tea as before, and escorted the fairy to the theater.  Their talk on the way there was hardly lovers&rsquo; talk. It was serious and  friendly rather. Mrs. Disney told him of her married life, and how she had  brought up her children. He seemed to have a greedy ear for all early traits of  character in his future step-daughter. &ldquo;And had she really shown such an ear  for music at two and a half? And did she really rescue a puppy from drowning at  the risk of spoiling her pinafore? Heroic child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  next day he bought a splendid half-hoop of diamonds in Prince&rsquo;s Square, and  offered it to his affianced wife by way of engagement-ring; but to his surprise  she declined it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have an idea that engagement rings are unlucky,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You shall give me  nothing but flowers and books till after your marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;wish  you would let me buy a seal-skin jacket for Rosa,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She is to be my  step-daughter so soon that it can&rsquo;t matter. I thought she looked cold yesterday  morning on the pier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs.  Disney thanked him for his thoughtfulness, and consented to this fatherly gift.  So the next day they all went to Bannington&rsquo;s, and Colonel Bosworth bought the  handsomest seal-skin coat which the establishment could produce. He would be  satisfied with nothing less than the very finest. It clothed Rosa from her chin  to her ankles, and she looked lovely in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall feel so wicked every time I pass a poor little beggar girl shivering in  her ragged frock,&rdquo; said Rosa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never  mind how you feel,&rdquo; said George; &ldquo;you look like an Esquimau princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel  Bosworth suggested that his betrothed should close her engagement at the  Theater Royal before the pantomime was withdrawn from the bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,  break faith with Mrs. De Courtenay, who was so kind to me!&rdquo; cried Rosalie. &ldquo;Not  for worlds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  colonel had urged her to name the day for their wedding. The sooner it should  take place the happier he would be. He was getting restless and out of spirits.  He had left off walking on the pier of a morning, and had lost all interest in  pink cats.</p>
<p>Mrs.  Disney hung back a little about the wedding. It could not be until after Lent,  she said. It was to be a very quiet wedding. They could decide upon the date at  any time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you think it would be an advantage to Rosa to spend a year or two at a  first-rate finishing school in Paris, or even with a private family?&rdquo; said the  colonel, rather abruptly, one evening, as he was escorting his betrothed to the  theater.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  why?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Disney.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;oh,  only for improvement. She told me she wanted to improve herself in French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  you would exile my child at the very outset,&rdquo; exclaimed Rosalie, with deepest  reproach. &ldquo;What a cruel step-father you are going to make!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  week after this the pantomime came to an end, and Lent began. The widow and her  old lover were walking on the East Cliff together after the last performance.  The moon was at the full again, just as it had been on that first night they  two had walked together. The tall white houses, the wide dark sea, were shining  in that silvery light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now, Rosalie,&rdquo; said Randolph, gently, with a gravity of manner that had been  growing upon him of late, &ldquo;it is time that you and I should come to some  definite arrangement about our wedding. When is it to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  she answered, sweetly, sadly, proudly, looking at him with a steadfast gaze. &ldquo;You  have been good and true, Randolph&mdash;true to the shadow of an old dream. You have  offered me a fair and happy future&mdash; yes, I feel that the life you offer would  be full of brightness and delight for me, who have tasted very few of the joys  of life. But I am not base enough to take advantage of the generous impulse  which prompted you to offer to a widow of nine-and-thirty the love you once  gave to a girl of nineteen. It cannot be, dear friend. In years we may be  fairly equal, but in heart and mind I am ages older than you; my cares and  sorrows should all count for years. You have asked me for bread, and I must not  give you a stone. You are still a young man. Your heart is as fresh as when you  asked me to be your wife twenty years ago; and only a young fresh heart can  give you such love as you desire. Randolph, I know of one young heart, pure,  innocent, and childlike in its simple trust, and I think that heart has gone  out to you unawares. Can you reciprocate that innocent, half-unconscious love?  Will you accept the daughter instead of the mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Would  he? His heart was beating so violently that he could not answer. He clutched  the iron railing with his broad, strong hand; he heard the roaring of the sea  vaguely, as if it had been a tumultuous noise in his own overcharged brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have guessed my secret,&rdquo; he said, hoarsely, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly  a month ago. I saw how it would be from the beginning. Don&rsquo;t apologize,  Randolph. I am so proud, so happy, for my darling&rsquo;s sake. I have nothing to  regret. Good-night. No, no, pray do not come any further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  snatched her hand from his, and walked swiftly to the little street which was  not far off. Randolph Bosworth went back to the Old Yacht like a man walking  upon air. Oh, what an earthly paradise the world seemed! The mother had not  been deceived. Yes, Rosa loved him&mdash;this soldier of forty years old &mdash;loved him  just as fondly as Rosalie had loved her hero in the days gone by. The colonel  met his darling on the pier in the breezy winter morning, and they had a happy  talk together amid the fresh wind and the briny spray. And in Easter week there  was a quiet wedding in one of the smaller churches of Helmstone, and Randolph  Bosworth carried his fair young bride to Rome to see the eternal city in its Easter  glory, while Mrs. Disney repaired to the Manor to set the house in order for  her daughter&rsquo;s coming.</p>
