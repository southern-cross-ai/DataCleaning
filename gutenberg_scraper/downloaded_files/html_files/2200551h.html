<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>Chapter 1. Lottery Ticket No.
514</h2>

<p>On the eighth day of last December, Mon. Gerbois, professor of
mathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old
curiosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which
pleased him very much on account of the multiplicity of its
drawers.</p>

<p>"Just the thing for Suzanne's birthday present," thought he. And
as he always tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his
daughter, consistent with his modest income, he enquired the price,
and, after some keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five
francs. As he was giving his address to the shopkeeper, a young
man, dressed with elegance and taste, who had been exploring the
stock of antiques, caught sight of the writing-desk, and
immediately enquired its price.</p>

<p>"It is sold," replied the shopkeeper.</p>

<p>"Ah! to this gentleman, I presume?"</p>

<p>Monsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be
the possessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a
gentleman of quality. But he had not taken a dozen steps in the
street, when he was overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and
in a tone of perfect courtesy, thus addressed him:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question
that you may deem impertinent. It is this: Did you have any special
object in view when you bought that writing-desk?"</p>

<p>"No, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy."</p>

<p>"But you do not care for it particularly?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall keep it&mdash;that is all."</p>

<p>"Because it is an antique, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No; because it is convenient," declared Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>"In that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk
that would be quite as convenient and in better condition?"</p>

<p>"Oh! this one is in good condition, and I see no object in
making an exchange."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper.
So he replied, testily:</p>

<p>"I beg of you, monsieur, do not insist."</p>

<p>But the young man firmly held his ground.</p>

<p>"I don't know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer
you double."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Three times the amount."</p>

<p>"Oh! that will do," exclaimed the professor, impatiently; "I
don't wish to sell it."</p>

<p>The young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon.
Gerbois would not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly
away.</p>

<p>An hour later, the desk was delivered at the professor's house
on the Viroflay road. He called his daughter, and said:</p>

<p>"Here is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it."</p>

<p>Suzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature.
She threw her arms around her father's neck and kissed him
rapturously. To her, the desk had all the semblance of a royal
gift. That evening, assisted by Hortense, the servant, she placed
the desk in her room; then she dusted it, cleaned the drawers and
pigeonholes, and carefully arranged within it her papers, writing
material, correspondence, a collection of postcards, and some
souvenirs of her cousin Philippe that she kept in secret.</p>

<p>Next morning, at half past seven, Mon. Gerbois went to the
college. At ten o'clock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne
went to meet him, and it was a great pleasure for him to see her
slender figure and childish smile waiting for him at the college
gate. They returned home together.</p>

<p>"And your writing desk&mdash;how is it this morning?"</p>

<p>"Marvellous! Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings
until they look like gold."</p>

<p>"So you are pleased with it?"</p>

<p>"Pleased with it! Why, I don't see how I managed to get on
without it for such a long time."</p>

<p>As they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon. Gerbois
said:</p>

<p>"Shall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, that's a splendid idea!"</p>

<p>She ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at
the door of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" stammered Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>"The writing-desk is gone!"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>When the police were called in, they were astonished at the
admirable simplicity of the means employed by the thief. During
Suzanne's absence, the servant had gone to market, and while the
house was thus left unguarded, a drayman, wearing a
badge&mdash;some of the neighbors saw it&mdash;stopped his cart in
front of the house and rang twice. Not knowing that Hortense was
absent, the neighbors were not suspicious; consequently, the man
carried on his work in peace and tranquility.</p>

<p>Apart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been
disturbed. Even Suzanne's purse, which she had left upon the
writing-desk, was found upon an adjacent table with its contents
untouched. It was obvious that the thief had come with a set
purpose, which rendered the crime even more mysterious; because,
why did he assume so great a risk for such a trifling object?</p>

<p>The only clue the professor could furnish was the strange
incident of the preceding evening. He declared:</p>

<p>"The young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an
idea that he threatened me as he went away."</p>

<p>But the clue was a vague one. The shopkeeper could not throw any
light on the affair. He did not know either of the gentlemen. As to
the desk itself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an
executor's sale at Chevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its
fair value. The police investigation disclosed nothing more.</p>

<p>But Mon. Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an
enormous loss. There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret
drawer, and that was the reason the young man had resorted to
crime.</p>

<p>"My poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?"
asked Suzanne.</p>

<p>"My child! with such a fortune, you could make a most
advantageous marriage."</p>

<p>Suzanne sighed bitterly. Her aspirations soared no higher than
her cousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object. And
life, in the little house at Versailles, was not so happy and
contented as of yore.</p>

<p>Two months passed away. Then came a succession of startling
events, a strange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!</p>

<p>On the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon. Gerbois
entered the house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on
his spectacles, and commenced to read. As politics did not interest
him, he turned to the inside of the paper. Immediately his
attention was attracted by an article entitled:</p>

<p>"Third Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.</p>

<p>"No. 514, series 23, draws a million."</p>

<p>The newspaper slipped from his fingers. The walls swam before
his eyes, and his heart ceased to beat. He held No. 514, series 23.
He had purchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any
thought of success, and behold, it was the lucky number!</p>

<p>Quickly, he took out his memorandum-book. Yes, he was quite
right. The No. 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of
the cover. But the ticket?</p>

<p>He rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had
placed the precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it
suddenly occurred to him that it had not been there for several
weeks. He heard footsteps on the gravel walk leading from the
street.</p>

<p>He called:</p>

<p>"Suzanne! Suzanne!"</p>

<p>She was returning from a walk. She entered hastily. He
stammered, in a choking voice:</p>

<p>"Suzanne...the box...the box of envelopes?"</p>

<p>"What box?"</p>

<p>"The one I bought at the Louvre...one Saturday...it was at the
end of that table."</p>

<p>"Don't you remember, father, we put all those things away
together."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"The evening...you know...the same evening..."</p>

<p>"But where?...Tell me, quick!...Where?"</p>

<p>"Where? Why, in the writing-desk."</p>

<p>"In the writing-desk that was stolen?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i>...In the stolen desk!"</p>

<p>He uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of
stupor. Then he seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he
said:</p>

<p>"It contained a million, my child."</p>

<p>"Ah! father, why didn't you tell me?" she murmured, naively.</p>

<p>"A million!" he repeated. "It contained the ticket that drew the
grand prize in the Press Lottery."</p>

<p>The colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and
for a long time they maintained a silence that they feared to
break. At last, Suzanne said:</p>

<p>"But, father, they will pay you just the same."</p>

<p>"How? On what proof?"</p>

<p>"Must you have proof?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"And you haven't any?"</p>

<p>"It was in the box."</p>

<p>"In the box that has disappeared."</p>

<p>"Yes; and now the thief will get the money."</p>

<p>"Oh! that would be terrible, father. You must prevent it."</p>

<p>For a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he
leaped up, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"No, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it!
Why should he have it? Ah! clever as he is, he can do nothing. If
he goes to claim the money, they will arrest him. Ah! now, we will
see, my fine fellow!"</p>

<p>"What will you do, father?"</p>

<p>"Defend our just rights, whatever happens! And we will succeed.
The million francs belong to me, and I intend to have them."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, he sent this telegram:</p>

<p class="letter">Governor Crédit Foncier<br>
rue Capucines, Paris.<br>
Am holder of No. 514, series 23. Oppose by all legal means any
other claimant.<br>
<br>
Gerbois.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, the Crédit Foncier received the
following telegram:</p>

<p class="letter">No. 514, series 23, is in my possession.<br>
<br>
Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Every time I undertake to relate one of the many extraordinary
adventures that mark the life of Arsène Lupin, I experience a
feeling of embarrassment, as it seems to me that the most
commonplace of those adventures is already well known to my
readers. In fact, there is not a movement of our "national thief,"
as he has been so aptly described, that has not been given the
widest publicity, not an exploit that has not been studied in all
its phases, not an action that has not been discussed with that
particularity usually reserved for the recital of heroic deeds.</p>

<p>For instance, who does not know the strange history of "The
Blonde Lady," with those curious episodes which were proclaimed by
the newspapers with heavy black headlines, as follows:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Lottery Ticket No. 514!"..."The Crime on the
Avenue Henri-Martin!"..."The Blue Diamond!"...The interest created
by the intervention of the celebrated English detective, Herlock
Sholmes! The excitement aroused by the various vicissitudes which
marked the struggle between those famous artists! And what a
commotion on the boulevards, the day on which the newsboys
announced: "Arrest of Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>My excuse for repeating these stories at this time is the fact
that I produce the key to the enigma. Those adventures have always
been enveloped in a certain degree of obscurity, which I now
remove. I reproduce old newspaper articles, I relate old-time
interviews, I present ancient letters; but I have arranged and
classified all that material and reduced it to the exact truth. My
collaborators in this work have been Arsène Lupin himself, and also
the ineffable Wilson, the friend and confidant of Herlock
Sholmes.</p>

<p>Everyone will recall the tremendous burst of laughter which
greeted the publication of those two telegrams. The name "Arsène
Lupin" was in itself a stimulus to curiosity, a promise of
amusement for the gallery. And, in this case, the gallery means the
entire world.</p>

<p>An investigation was immediately commenced by the Crédit
Foncier, which established these facts: That ticket No. 514, series
23, had been sold by the Versailles branch office of the Lottery to
an artillery officer named Bessy, who was afterward killed by a
fall from his horse. Some time before his death, he informed some
of his comrades that he had transferred his ticket to a friend.</p>

<p>"And I am that friend," affirmed Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>"Prove it," replied the governor of the Crédit Foncier.</p>

<p>"Of course I can prove it. Twenty people can tell you that I was
an intimate friend of Monsieur Bessy, and that we frequently met at
the Café de la Place-d'Armes. It was there, one day, I purchased
the ticket from him for twenty francs&mdash;simply as an
accommodation to him."</p>

<p>"Have you any witnesses to that transaction?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, how do you expect to prove it?"</p>

<p>"By a letter he wrote to me."</p>

<p>"What letter?"</p>

<p>"A letter that was pinned to the ticket."</p>

<p>"Produce it."</p>

<p>"It was stolen at the same time as the ticket."</p>

<p>"Well, you must find it."</p>

<p>It was soon learned that Arsène Lupin had the letter. A short
paragraph appeared in the <i>Echo de France</i>&mdash;which has the
honor to be his official organ, and of which, it is said, he is one
of the principal shareholders&mdash;the paragraph announced that
Arsène Lupin had placed in the hands of Monsieur Detinan, his
advocate and legal adviser, the letter that Monsieur Bessy had
written to him&mdash;to him personally.</p>

<p>This announcement provoked an outburst of laughter. Arsène Lupin
had engaged a lawyer! Arsène Lupin, conforming to the rules and
customs of modern society, had appointed a legal representative in
the person of a well-known member of the Parisian bar!</p>

<p>Mon. Detinan had never enjoyed the pleasure of meeting Arsène
Lupin&mdash;a fact he deeply regretted&mdash;but he had actually
been retained by that mysterious gentleman and felt greatly honored
by the choice. He was prepared to defend the interests of his
client to the best of his ability. He was pleased, even proud, to
exhibit the letter of Mon. Bessy, but, although it proved the
transfer of the ticket, it did not mention the name of the
purchaser. It was simply addressed to "My Dear Friend."</p>

<p>"My Dear Friend! that is I," added Arsène Lupin, in a note
attached to Mon. Bessy's letter. "And the best proof of that fact
is that I hold the letter."</p>

<p>The swarm of reporters immediately rushed to see Mon. Gerbois,
who could only repeat:</p>

<p>"My Dear Friend! that is I...Arsène Lupin stole the letter with
the lottery ticket."</p>

<p>"Let him prove it!" retorted Lupin to the reporters.</p>

<p>"He must have done it, because he stole the writing-desk!"
exclaimed Mon. Gerbois before the same reporters.</p>

<p>"Let him prove it!" replied Lupin.</p>

<p>Such was the entertaining comedy enacted by the two claimants of
ticket No. 514; and the calm demeanor of Arsène Lupin contrasted
strangely with the nervous perturbation of poor Mon. Gerbois. The
newspapers were filled with the lamentations of that unhappy man.
He announced his misfortune with pathetic candor.</p>

<p>"Understand, gentlemen, it was Suzanne's dowry that the rascal
stole! Personally, I don't care a straw for it,...but for Suzanne!
Just think of it, a whole million! Ten times one hundred thousand
francs! Ah! I knew very well that the desk contained a
treasure!"</p>

<p>It was in vain to tell him that his adversary, when stealing the
desk, was unaware that the lottery ticket was in it, and that, in
any event, he could not foresee that the ticket would draw the
grand prize. He would reply:</p>

<p>"Nonsense! of course, he knew it...else why would he take the
trouble to steal a poor, miserable desk?"</p>

<p>"For some unknown reason; but certainly not for a small scrap of
paper which was then worth only twenty francs."</p>

<p>"A million francs! He knew it;...he knows everything! Ah! you do
not know him&mdash;the scoundrel!...He hasn't robbed you of a
million francs!"</p>

<p>The controversy would have lasted for a much longer time, but,
on the twelfth day, Mon. Gerbois received from Arsène Lupin a
letter, marked "confidential," which read as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">Monsieur, the gallery is being amused at our
expense. Do you not think it is time for us to be serious? The
situation is this: I possess a ticket to which I have no legal
right, and you have the legal right to a ticket you do not possess.
Neither of us can do anything. You will not relinquish your rights
to me; I will not deliver the ticket to you. Now, what is to be
done?<br>
<br>
I see only one way out of the difficulty: Let us divide the spoils.
A half-million for you; a half-million for me. Is not that a fair
division? In my opinion, it is an equitable solution, and an
immediate one. I will give you three days' time to consider the
proposition. On Thursday morning I shall expect to read in the
personal column of the <i>Echo de France</i> a discreet message
addressed to <i>M. Ars. Lup.</i>, expressing in veiled terms your
consent to my offer. By so doing you will recover immediate
possession of the ticket; then you can collect the money and send
me half a million in a manner that I will describe to you
later.<br>
<br>
In case of your refusal, I shall resort to other measures to
accomplish the same result. But, apart from the very serious
annoyances that such obstinacy on your part will cause you, it will
cost you twenty-five thousand francs for supplementary
expenses.<br>
<br>
Believe me, monsieur,<br>
I remain your devoted servant, Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>In a fit of exasperation Mon. Gerbois committed the grave
mistake of showing that letter and allowing a copy of it to be
taken. His indignation overcame his discretion.</p>

<p>"Nothing! He shall have nothing!" he exclaimed, before a crowd
of reporters. "To divide my property with him? Never! Let him tear
up the ticket if he wishes!"</p>

<p>"Yet five hundred thousand francs is better than nothing."</p>

<p>"That is not the question. It is a question of my just right,
and that right I will establish before the courts."</p>

<p>"What! attack Arsène Lupin? That would be amusing."</p>

<p>"No; but the Crédit Foncier. They must pay me the million
francs."</p>

<p>"Without producing the ticket, or, at least, without proving
that you bought it?"</p>

<p>"That proof exists, since Arsène Lupin admits that he stole the
writing-desk."</p>

<p>"But would the word of Arsène Lupin carry any weight with the
court?"</p>

<p>"No matter; I will fight it out."</p>

<p>The gallery shouted with glee; and wagers were freely made upon
the result with the odds in favor of Lupin. On the following
Thursday the personal column in the <i>Echo de France</i> was
eagerly perused by the expectant public, but it contained nothing
addressed to <i>M. Ars. Lup.</i> Mon. Gerbois had not replied to
Arsène Lupin's letter. That was the declaration of war.</p>

<p>That evening the newspapers announced the abduction of Mlle.
Suzanne Gerbois.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The most entertaining feature in what might be called the Arsène
Lupin dramas is the comic attitude displayed by the Parisian
police. Arsène Lupin talks, plans, writes, commands, threatens and
executes as if the police did not exist. They never figure in his
calculations.</p>

<p>And yet the police do their utmost. But what can they do against
such a foe&mdash;a foe that scorns and ignores them?</p>

<p>Suzanne had left the house at twenty minutes to ten; such was
the testimony of the servant. On leaving the college, at five
minutes past ten, her father did not find her at the place she was
accustomed to wait for him. Consequently, whatever had happened
must have occurred during the course of Suzanne's walk from the
house to the college. Two neighbors had met her about three hundred
yards from the house. A lady had seen, on the avenue, a young girl
corresponding to Suzanne's description. No one else had seen
her.</p>

<p>Inquiries were made in all directions; the employees of the
railways and streetcar lines were questioned, but none of them had
seen anything of the missing girl. However, at Ville-d'Avray, they
found a shopkeeper who had furnished gasoline to an automobile that
had come from Paris on the day of the abduction. It was occupied by
a blonde woman&mdash;extremely blonde, said the witness. An hour
later, the automobile again passed through Ville-d'Avray on its way
from Versailles to Paris. The shopkeeper declared that the
automobile now contained a second woman who was heavily veiled. No
doubt, it was Suzanne Gerbois.</p>

<p>The abduction must have taken place in broad daylight, on a
frequented street, in the very heart of the town. How? And at what
spot? Not a cry was heard; not a suspicious action had been seen.
The shopkeeper described the automobile as a royal-blue limousine
of twenty-four horsepower made by the firm of Peugeon &amp; Co.
Inquiries were then made at the Grand-Garage, managed by Madame
Bob-Walthour, who made a specialty of abductions by automobile. It
was learned that she had rented a Peugeon limousine on that day to
a blonde woman whom she had never seen before nor since.</p>

<p>"Who was the chauffeur?"</p>

<p>"A young man named Ernest, whom I had engaged only the day
before. He came well recommended."</p>

<p>"Is he here now?"</p>

<p>"No. He brought back the machine, but I haven't seen him since,"
said Madame Bob-Walthour.</p>

<p>"Do you know where we can find him?"</p>

<p>"You might see the people who recommended him to me. Here are
the names."</p>

<p>Upon inquiry, it was learned that none of these people knew the
man called Ernest. The recommendations were forged.</p>

<p>Such was the fate of every clue followed by the police. It ended
nowhere. The mystery remained unsolved.</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois had not the strength or courage to wage such an
unequal battle. The disappearance of his daughter crushed him; he
capitulated to the enemy. A short announcement in the <i>Echo de
France</i> proclaimed his unconditional surrender.</p>

<p>Two days later, Mon. Gerbois visited the office of the Crédit
Foncier and handed lottery ticket number 514, series 23, to the
governor, who exclaimed, with surprise:</p>

<p>"Ah! you have it! He has returned it to you!"</p>

<p>"It was mislaid. That was all," replied Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>"But you pretended that it had been stolen."</p>

<p>"At first, I thought it had...but here it is."</p>

<p>"We will require some evidence to establish your right to the
ticket."</p>

<p>"Will the letter of the purchaser, Monsieur Bessy, be
sufficient!"</p>

<p>"Yes, that will do."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Mon. Gerbois, producing the letter.</p>

<p>"Very well. Leave these papers with us. The rules of the lottery
allow us fifteen days' time to investigate your claim. I will let
you know when to call for your money. I presume you desire, as much
as I do, that this affair should be closed without further
publicity."</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois and the governor henceforth maintained a discreet
silence. But the secret was revealed in some way, for it was soon
commonly known that Arsène Lupin had returned the lottery ticket to
Mon. Gerbois. The public received the news with astonishment and
admiration. Certainly, he was a bold gamester who thus threw upon
the table a trump card of such importance as the precious ticket.
But, it was true, he still retained a trump card of equal
importance. However, if the young girl should escape? If the
hostage held by Arsène Lupin should be rescued?</p>

<p>The police thought they had discovered the weak spot of the
enemy, and now redoubled their efforts. Arsène Lupin disarmed by
his own act, crushed by the wheels of his own machination, deprived
of every sou of the coveted million...public interest now centered
in the camp of his adversary.</p>

<p>But it was necessary to find Suzanne. And they did not find her,
nor did she escape. Consequently, it must be admitted, Arsène Lupin
had won the first hand. But the game was not yet decided. The most
difficult point remained. Mlle. Gerbois is in his possession, and
he will hold her until he receives five hundred thousand francs.
But how and where will such an exchange be made? For that purpose,
a meeting must be arranged, and then what will prevent Mon. Gerbois
from warning the police and, in that way, effecting the rescue of
his daughter and, at the same time, keeping his money? The
professor was interviewed, but he was extremely reticent. His
answer was:</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say."</p>

<p>"And Mlle. Gerbois?"</p>

<p>"The search is being continued."</p>

<p>"But Arsène Lupin has written to you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do you swear to that?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then it is true. What are his instructions?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say."</p>

<p>Then the interviewers attacked Mon. Detinan, and found him
equally discreet.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin is my client, and I cannot discuss his affairs,"
he replied, with an affected air of gravity.</p>

<p>These mysteries served to irritate the gallery. Obviously, some
secret negotiations were in progress. Arsène Lupin had arranged and
tightened the meshes of his net, while the police maintained a
close watch, day and night, over Mon. Gerbois. And the three and
only possible dénouements&mdash;the arrest, the triumph, or the
ridiculous and pitiful abortion&mdash;were freely discussed; but
the curiosity of the public was only partially satisfied, and it
was reserved for these pages to reveal the exact truth of the
affair.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>On Monday, March 12th, Mon. Gerbois received a notice from the
Crédit Foncier. On Wednesday, he took the one o'clock train for
Paris. At two o'clock, a thousand banknotes of one thousand francs
each were delivered to him. Whilst he was counting them, one by
one, in a state of nervous agitation&mdash;that money, which
represented Suzanne's ransom&mdash;a carriage containing two men
stopped at the curb a short distance from the bank. One of the men
had grey hair and an unusually shrewd expression which formed a
striking contrast to his shabby makeup. It was Detective Ganimard,
the relentless enemy of Arsène Lupin. Ganimard said to his
companion, Folenfant:</p>

<p>"In five minutes, we will see our clever friend Lupin. Is
everything ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How many men have we?"</p>

<p>"Eight&mdash;two of them on bicycles."</p>

<p>"Enough, but not too many. On no account, must Gerbois escape
us; if he does, it is all up. He will meet Lupin at the appointed
place, give half a million in exchange for the girl, and the game
will be over."</p>

<p>"But why doesn't Gerbois work with us? That would be the better
way, and he could keep all the money himself."</p>

<p>"Yes, but he is afraid that if he deceives the other, he will
not get his daughter."</p>

<p>"What other?"</p>

<p>"Lupin."</p>

<p>Ganimard pronounced the word in a solemn tone, somewhat timidly,
as if he were speaking of some supernatural creature whose claws he
already felt.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," remarked Folenfant, judiciously, "that we
are obliged to protect this gentleman contrary to his own
wishes."</p>

<p>"Yes, but Lupin always turns the world upside down," said
Ganimard, mournfully.</p>

<p>A moment later, Mon. Gerbois appeared, and started up the
street. At the end of the rue des Capucines, he turned into the
boulevards, walking slowly, and stopping frequently to gaze at the
shopwindows.</p>

<p>"Much too calm, too self-possessed," said Ganimard. "A man with
a million in his pocket would not have that air of
tranquillity."</p>

<p>"What is he doing?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing, evidently...But I have a suspicion that it is
Lupin&mdash;yes, Lupin!"</p>

<p>At that moment, Mon. Gerbois stopped at a newsstand, purchased a
paper, unfolded it and commenced to read it as he walked slowly
away. A moment later, he gave a sudden bound into an automobile
that was standing at the curb. Apparently, the machine had been
waiting for him, as it started away rapidly, turned at the
Madeleine and disappeared.</p>

<p>"<i>Nom de nom!</i>" cried Ganimard, "that's one of his old
tricks!"</p>

<p>Ganimard hastened after the automobile around the Madeleine.
Then, he burst into laughter. At the entrance to the Boulevard
Malesherbes, the automobile had stopped and Mon. Gerbois had
alighted.</p>

<p>"Quick, Folenfant, the chauffeur! It may be the man Ernest."</p>

<p>Folenfant interviewed the chauffeur. His name was Gaston; he was
an employee of the automobile cab company; ten minutes ago, a
gentleman had engaged him and told him to wait near the newsstand
for another gentleman.</p>

<p>"And the second man&mdash;what address did he give?" asked
Folenfant.</p>

<p>"No address. 'Boulevard Malesherbes...avenue de
Messine...<i>double pourboire</i>.' That is all."</p>

<p>But, during this time, Mon. Gerbois had leaped into the first
passing carriage.</p>

<p>"To the Concorde station, Metropolitan," he said to the
driver.</p>

<p>He left the underground at the Place du Palais-Royal, ran to
another carriage and ordered it to go to the Place de la Bourse.
Then a second journey by the underground to the Avenue de Villiers,
followed by a third carriage drive to number 25 rue Clapeyron.</p>

<p>Number 25 rue Clapeyron is separated from the Boulevard des
Batignolles by the house which occupies the angle formed by the two
streets. He ascended to the first floor and rang. A gentleman
opened the door.</p>

<p>"Does Monsieur Detinan live here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my name. Are you Monsieur Gerbois?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I was expecting you. Step in."</p>

<p>As Mon. Gerbois entered the lawyer's office, the clock struck
three. He said:</p>

<p>"I am prompt to the minute. Is he here?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois took a seat, wiped his forehead, looked at his
watch as if he did not know the time, and inquired, anxiously:</p>

<p>"Will he come?"</p>

<p>"Well, monsieur," replied the lawyer, "that I do not know, but I
am quite as anxious and impatient as you are to find out. If he
comes, he will run a great risk, as this house has been closely
watched for the last two weeks. They distrust me."</p>

<p>"They suspect me, too. I am not sure whether the detectives lost
sight of me or not on my way here."</p>

<p>"But you were&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be my fault," cried the professor, quickly. "You
cannot reproach me. I promised to obey his orders, and I followed
them to the very letter. I drew the money at the time fixed by him,
and I came here in the manner directed by him. I have faithfully
performed my part of the agreement&mdash;let him do his!"</p>

<p>After a short silence, he asked, anxiously:</p>

<p>"He will bring my daughter, won't he?"</p>

<p>"I expect so."</p>

<p>"But...you have seen him?"</p>

<p>"I? No, not yet. He made the appointment by letter, saying both
of you would be here, and asking me to dismiss my servants before
three o'clock and admit no one while you were here. If I would not
consent to that arrangement, I was to notify him by a few words in
the <i>Echo de France</i>. But I am only too happy to oblige Mon.
Lupin, and so I consented."</p>

<p>"Ah! how will this end?" moaned Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>He took the banknotes from his pocket, placed them on the table
and divided them into two equal parts. Then the two men sat there
in silence. From time to time, Mon. Gerbois would listen. Did
someone ring?...His nervousness increased every minute, and
Monsieur Detinan also displayed considerable anxiety. At last, the
lawyer lost his patience. He rose abruptly, and said:</p>

<p>"He will not come...We shouldn't expect it. It would be folly
on his part. He would run too great a risk."</p>

<p>And Mon. Gerbois, despondent, his hands resting on the
banknotes, stammered:</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>Mon Dieu!</i> I hope he will come. I would give the
whole of that money to see my daughter again."</p>

<p>The door opened.</p>

<p>"Half of it will be sufficient, Monsieur Gerbois."</p>

<p>These words were spoken by a well-dressed young man who now
entered the room and was immediately recognized by Mon. Gerbois as
the person who had wished to buy the desk from him at Versailles.
He rushed toward him.</p>

<p>"Where is my daughter&mdash;my Suzanne?"</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin carefully closed the door, and, while slowly
removing his gloves, said to the lawyer:</p>

<p>"My dear maître, I am indebted to you very much for your
kindness in consenting to defend my interests. I shall not forget
it."</p>

<p>Mon. Detinan murmured:</p>

<p>"But you did not ring. I did not hear the door&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Doors and bells are things that should work without being
heard. I am here, and that is the important point."</p>

<p>"My daughter! Suzanne! Where is she!" repeated the
professor.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, monsieur," said Lupin, "what's your hurry?
Your daughter will be here in a moment."</p>

<p>Lupin walked to and fro for a minute, then, with the pompous air
of an orator, he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Gerbois, I congratulate you on the clever way in which
you made the journey to this place."</p>

<p>Then, perceiving the two piles of banknotes, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! I see! the million is here. We will not lose any time.
Permit me."</p>

<p>"One moment," said the lawyer, placing himself before the table.
"Mlle. Gerbois has not yet arrived."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Is not her presence indispensable?"</p>

<p>"I understand! I understand! Arsène Lupin inspires only a
limited confidence. He might pocket the half-million and not
restore the hostage. Ah! monsieur, people do not understand me.
Because I have been obliged, by force of circumstances, to commit
certain actions a little...out of the ordinary, my good faith is
impugned...I, who have always observed the utmost scrupulosity and
delicacy in business affairs. Besides, my dear monsieur if you have
any fear, open the window and call. There are at least a dozen
detectives in the street."</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin raised the curtain.</p>

<p>"I think that Monsieur Gerbois could not throw Ganimard off the
scent...What did I tell you? There he is now."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed the professor. "But I swear to
you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That you have not betrayed me?...I do not doubt you, but those
fellows are clever&mdash;sometimes. Ah! I can see Folenfant, and
Greaume, and Dieuzy&mdash;all good friends of mine!"</p>

<p>Mon. Detinan looked at Lupin in amazement. What assurance! He
laughed as merrily as if engaged in some childish sport, as if no
danger threatened him. This unconcern reassured the lawyer more
than the presence of the detectives. He left the table on which the
banknotes were lying. Arsène Lupin picked up one pile of bills
after the other, took from each of them twenty-five banknotes which
he offered to Mon. Detinan, saying:</p>

<p>"The reward of your services to Monsieur Gerbois and Arsène
Lupin. You well deserve it."</p>

<p>"You owe me nothing," replied the lawyer.</p>

<p>"What! After all the trouble we have caused you!"</p>

<p>"And all the pleasure you have given me!"</p>

<p>"That means, my dear monsieur, that you do not wish to accept
anything from Arsène Lupin. See what it is to have a bad
reputation."</p>

<p>He then offered the fifty thousand francs to Mon. Gerbois,
saying:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, in memory of our pleasant interview, permit me to
return you this as a wedding-gift to Mlle. Gerbois."</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois took the money, but said:</p>

<p>"My daughter will not marry."</p>

<p>"She will not marry if you refuse your consent; but she wishes
to marry."</p>

<p>"What do you know about it?"</p>

<p>"I know that young girls often dream of such things unknown to
their parents. Fortunately, there are sometimes good genii like
Arsène Lupin who discover their little secrets in the drawers of
their writing desks."</p>

<p>"Did you find anything else?" asked the lawyer. "I confess I am
curious to know why you took so much trouble to get possession of
that desk."</p>

<p>"On account of its historic interest, my friend. Although
despite the opinion of Monsieur Gerbois, the desk contained no
treasure except the lottery ticket&mdash;and that was unknown to
me&mdash;I had been seeking it for a long time. That writing-desk
of yew and mahogany was discovered in the little house in which
Marie Walêwska once lived in Boulogne, and, on one of the drawers
there is this inscription:</p>

<p>"'<i>Dedicated to Napoleon I, Emperor of the French, by his very
faithful servant, Mancion.</i>'</p>

<p>"And above it, these words, engraved with the point of a knife:
'To you, Marie.' Afterwards, Napoleon had a similar desk made for
the Empress Josephine; so that the secretary that was so much
admired at the Malmaison was only an imperfect copy of the one that
will henceforth form part of my collection."</p>

<p>"Ah! if I had known, when in the shop, I would gladly have given
it up to you," said the professor.</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin smiled, as he replied:</p>

<p>"And you would have had the advantage of keeping for your own
use lottery ticket number 514."</p>

<p>"And you would not have found it necessary to abduct my
daughter."</p>

<p>"Abduct your daughter?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"My dear monsieur, you are mistaken. Mlle. Gerbois was not
abducted."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Abduction means force or violence. And I assure
you that she served as hostage of her own free will."</p>

<p>"Of her own free will!" repeated Mon. Gerbois, in amazement.</p>

<p>"In fact, she almost asked to be taken. Why, do you suppose that
an intelligent young girl like Mlle. Gerbois, and who, moreover,
nourishes an unacknowledged passion, would hesitate to do what was
necessary to secure her dowry. Ah! I swear to you it was not
difficult to make her understand that it was the only way to
overcome your obstinacy."</p>

<p>Mon. Detinan was greatly amused. He replied to Lupin:</p>

<p>"But I should think it was more difficult to get her to listen
to you. How did you approach her?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I didn't approach her myself. I have not the honor of her
acquaintance. A friend of mine, a lady, carried on the
negotiations."</p>

<p>"The blonde woman in the automobile, no doubt."</p>

<p>"Precisely. All arrangements were made at the first interview
near the college. Since then, Mlle. Gerbois and her new friend have
been travelling in Belgium and Holland in a manner that should
prove most pleasing and instructive to a young girl. She will tell
you all about it herself&mdash;"</p>

<p>The bell of the vestibule door rang, three rings in quick
succession, followed by two isolated rings.</p>

<p>"It is she," said Lupin. "Monsieur Detinan, if you will be so
kind&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lawyer hastened to the door.</p>

<p>Two young women entered. One of them threw herself into the arms
of Mon. Gerbois. The other approached Lupin. The latter was a tall
woman of a good figure, very pale complexion, and with blond hair,
parted over her forehead in undulating waves, that glistened and
shone like the setting sun. She was dressed in black, with no
display of jewelled ornaments; but, on the contrary, her appearance
indicated good taste and refined elegance. Arsène Lupin spoke a few
words to her; then, bowing to Mlle. Gerbois, he said:</p>

<p>"I owe you an apology, mademoiselle, for all your troubles, but
I hope you have not been too unhappy&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unhappy! Why, I should have been very happy, indeed, if it
hadn't been for leaving my poor father."</p>

<p>"Then all is for the best. Kiss him again, and take advantage of
the opportunity&mdash;it is an excellent one&mdash;to speak to him
about your cousin."</p>

<p>"My cousin! What do you mean? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Of course, you understand. Your cousin Philippe. The young man
whose letters you kept so carefully."</p>

<p>Suzanne blushed; but, following Lupin's advice, she again threw
herself into her father's arms. Lupin gazed upon them with a tender
look.</p>

<p>"Ah! Such is my reward for a virtuous act! What a touching
picture! A happy father and a happy daughter! And to know that
their joy is your work, Lupin! Hereafter these people will bless
you, and reverently transmit your name unto their descendants, even
unto the fourth generation. What a glorious reward, Lupin, for one
act of kindness!"</p>

<p>He walked to the window.</p>

<p>"Is dear old Ganimard still waiting?...He would like very much
to be present at this charming domestic scene!...Ah! he is not
there...Nor any of the others...I don't see anyone. The deuce!
The situation is becoming serious. I dare say they are already
under the porte-cochère...talking to the concierge, perhaps...or,
even, ascending the stairs!"</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois made a sudden movement. Now, that his daughter had
been restored to him, he saw the situation in a different light. To
him, the arrest of his adversary meant half-a-million francs.
Instinctively, he made a step forward. As if by chance, Lupin stood
in his way.</p>

<p>"Where are you going, Monsieur Gerbois? To defend me against
them? That is very kind of you, but I assure you it is not
necessary. They are more worried than I."</p>

<p>Then he continued to speak, with calm deliberation:</p>

<p>"But, really, what do they know? That you are here, and,
perhaps, that Mlle. Gerbois is here, for they may have seen her
arrive with an unknown lady. But they do not imagine that I am
here. How is it possible that I could be in a house that they
ransacked from cellar to garret this morning? They suppose that the
unknown lady was sent by me to make the exchange, and they will be
ready to arrest her when she goes out&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment, the bell rang. With a brusque movement, Lupin
seized Mon. Gerbois, and said to him, in an imperious tone:</p>

<p>"Do not move! Remember your daughter, and be
prudent&mdash;otherwise&mdash;As to you, Monsieur Detinan, I have
your promise."</p>

<p>Mon. Gerbois was rooted to the spot. The lawyer did not stir.
Without the least sign of haste, Lupin picked up his hat and
brushed the dust from off it with his sleeve.</p>

<p>"My dear Monsieur Detinan, if I can ever be of service to
you...My best wishes, Mademoiselle Suzanne, and my kind regards to
Monsieur Philippe."</p>

<p>He drew a heavy gold watch from his pocket.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Gerbois, it is now forty-two minutes past three. At
forty-six minutes past three, I give you permission to leave this
room. Not one minute sooner than forty-six minutes past three."</p>

<p>"But they will force an entrance," suggested Mon. Detinan.</p>

<p>"You forget the law, my dear monsieur! Ganimard would never
venture to violate the privacy of a French citizen. But, pardon me,
time flies, and you are all slightly nervous."</p>

<p>He placed his watch on the table, opened the door of the room
and addressing the blonde lady he said:</p>

<p>"Are you ready my dear?"</p>

<p>He drew back to let her pass, bowed respectfully to Mlle.
Gerbois, and went out, closing the door behind him. Then they heard
him in the vestibule, speaking, in a loud voice: "Good day,
Ganimard, how goes it? Remember me to Madame Ganimard. One of these
days, I shall invite her to breakfast. Au revoir, Ganimard."</p>

<p>The bell rang violently, followed by repeated rings, and voices
on the landing.</p>

<p>"Forty-five minutes," muttered Mon. Gerbois.</p>

<p>After a few seconds, he left the room and stepped into the
vestibule. Arsène Lupin and the blonde lady had gone.</p>

<p>"Papa!...you mustn't! Wait!" cried Suzanne.</p>

<p>"Wait! you are foolish!...No quarter for that rascal!...And the
half-million?"</p>

<p>He opened the outer door. Ganimard rushed in.</p>

<p>"That woman&mdash;where is she? And Lupin?"</p>

<p>"He was here...he is here."</p>

<p>Ganimard uttered a cry of triumph.</p>

<p>"We have him. The house is surrounded."</p>

<p>"But the servant's stairway?" suggested Mon. Detinan.</p>

<p>"It leads to the court," said Ganimard. "There is only one
exit&mdash;the street-door. Ten men are guarding it."</p>

<p>"But he didn't come in by the street-door, and he will not go
out that way."</p>

<p>"What way, then?" asked Ganimard. "Through the air?"</p>

<p>He drew aside a curtain and exposed a long corridor leading to
the kitchen. Ganimard ran along it and tried the door of the
servants' stairway. It was locked. From the window he called to one
of his assistants:</p>

<p>"Seen anyone?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then they are still in the house!" he exclaimed. "They are
hiding in one of the rooms! They cannot have escaped. Ah! Lupin,
you fooled me before, but, this time, I get my revenge."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At seven o'clock in the evening, Mon. Dudonis, chief of the
detective service, astonished at not receiving any news, visited
the rue Clapeyron. He questioned the detectives who were guarding
the house, then ascended to Mon. Detinan's apartment. The lawyer
led him into his room. There, Mon. Dudonis beheld a man, or rather
two legs kicking in the air, while the body to which they belonged
was hidden in the depths of the chimney.</p>

<p>"<i>Ohé!...Ohé!</i>" gasped a stifled voice. And a more distant
voice, from on high, replied:</p>

<p>"<i>Ohé!...Ohé!</i>"</p>

<p>Mon. Dudonis laughed, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Here! Ganimard, have you turned chimney-sweep?"</p>

<p>The detective crawled out of the chimney. With his blackened
face, his sooty clothes, and his feverish eyes, he was quite
unrecognizable.</p>

<p>"I am looking for <i>him</i>," he growled.</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin...and his friend."</p>

<p>"Well, do you suppose they are hiding in the chimney?"</p>

<p>Ganimard arose, laid his sooty hand on the sleeve of his
superior officer's coat, and exclaimed, angrily:</p>

<p>"Where do you think they are, chief? They must be somewhere!
They are flesh and blood like you and me, and can't fade away like
smoke."</p>

<p>"No, but they have faded away just the same."</p>

<p>"But how? How? The house is surrounded by our men&mdash;even on
the roof."</p>

<p>"What about the adjoining house?"</p>

<p>"There's no communication with it."</p>

<p>"And the apartments on the other floors?"</p>

<p>"I know all the tenants. They have not seen anyone."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you know all of them?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The concierge answers for them. Besides, as an extra
precaution, I have placed a man in each apartment. They can't
escape. If I don't get them tonight, I will get them tomorrow. I
shall sleep here."</p>

<p>He slept there that night and the two following nights. Three
days and nights passed away without the discovery of the
irrepressible Lupin or his female companion; more than that,
Ganimard did not unearth the slightest clue on which to base a
theory to explain their escape. For that reason, he adhered to his
first opinion.</p>

<p>"There is no trace of their escape; therefore, they are
here."</p>

<p>It may be that, at the bottom of his heart, his conviction was
less firmly established, but he would not confess it. No, a
thousand times, no! A man and a woman could not vanish like the
evil spirits in a fairy tale. And, without losing his courage, he
continued his searches, as if he expected to find the fugitives
concealed in some impenetrable retreat, or embodied in the stone
walls of the house.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>Chapter 2. The Blue Diamonds</h2>

<p>On the evening of March 27, at number 134 avenue Henri-Martin,
in the house that he had inherited from his brother six months
before, the old general Baron d'Hautrec, ambassador at Berlin under
the second Empire, was asleep in a comfortable armchair, while his
secretary was reading to him, and the Sister Auguste was warming
his bed and preparing the night-lamp. At eleven o'clock, the
Sister, who was obliged to return to the convent of her order at
that hour, said to the secretary:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Antoinette, my work is finished; I am going."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sister."</p>

<p>"Do not forget that the cook is away, and that you are alone in
the house with the servant."</p>

<p>"Have no fear for the Baron. I sleep in the adjoining room and
always leave the door open."</p>

<p>The Sister left the house. A few moments later, Charles, the
servant, came to receive his orders. The Baron was now awake, and
spoke for himself.</p>

<p>"The usual orders, Charles: see that the electric bell rings in
your room, and, at the first alarm, run for the doctor. Now,
Mademoiselle Antoinette, how far did we get in our reading?"</p>

<p>"Is Monsieur not going to bed now?"</p>

<p>"No, no, I will go later. Besides, I don't need anyone."</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, he was sleeping again, and Antoinette
crept away on tiptoe. At that moment, Charles was closing the
shutters on the lower floor. In the kitchen, he bolted the door
leading to the garden, and, in the vestibule, he not only locked
the door but hooked the chain as well. Then he ascended to his room
on the third floor, went to bed, and was soon asleep.</p>

<p>Probably an hour had passed, when he leaped from his bed in
alarm. The bell was ringing. It rang for some time, seven or eight
seconds perhaps, without intermission.</p>

<p>"Well!" muttered Charles, recovering his wits, "another of the
Baron's whims."</p>

<p>He dressed himself quickly, descended the stairs, stopped in
front of the door, and rapped, according to his custom. He received
no reply. He opened the door and entered.</p>

<p>"Ah! no light," he murmured. "What is that for?"</p>

<p>Then, in a low voice, he called:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>No reply.</p>

<p>"Are you there, mademoiselle? What's the matter? Is Monsieur le
Baron ill?"</p>

<p>No reply. Nothing but a profound silence that soon became
depressing. He took two steps forward; his foot struck a chair,
and, having touched it, he noticed that it was overturned. Then,
with his hand, he discovered other objects on the floor&mdash;a
small table and a screen. Anxiously, he approached the wall, felt
for the electric button, and turned on the light.</p>

<p>In the centre of the room, between the table and dressing-case,
lay the body of his master, the Baron d'Hautrec.</p>

<p>"What!...It can't be possible!" he stammered.</p>

<p>He could not move. He stood there, with bulging eyes, gazing
stupidly at the terrible disorder, the overturned chairs, a large
crystal candelabra shattered in a thousand pieces, the clock lying
on the marble hearthstone, all evidence of a fearful and desperate
struggle. The handle of a stiletto glittered, not far from the
corpse; the blade was stained with blood. A handkerchief, marked
with red spots, was lying on the edge of the bed.</p>

<p>Charles recoiled with horror: the body lying at his feet
extended itself for a moment, then shrunk up again; two or three
tremors, and that was the end.</p>

<p>He stooped over the body. There was a clean-cut wound on the
neck from which the blood was flowing and then congealing in a
black pool on the carpet. The face retained an expression of
extreme terror.</p>

<p>"Someone has killed him!" he muttered, "someone has killed
him!"</p>

<p>Then he shuddered at the thought that there might be another
dreadful crime. Did not the baron's secretary sleep in the
adjoining room? Had not the assassin killed her also? He opened the
door; the room was empty. He concluded that Antoinette had been
abducted, or else she had gone away before the crime. He returned
to the baron's chamber, his glance falling on the secretary, he
noticed that that article of furniture remained intact. Then, he
saw upon a table, beside a bunch of keys and a pocketbook that the
baron placed there every night, a handful of golden <i>louis</i>.
Charles seized the pocketbook, opened it, and found some banknotes.
He counted them; there were thirteen notes of one hundred francs
each.</p>

<p>Instinctively, mechanically, he put the banknotes in his pocket,
rushed down the stairs, drew the bolt, unhooked the chain, closed
the door behind him, and fled to the street.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Charles was an honest man. He had scarcely left the gate, when,
cooled by the night air and the rain, he came to a sudden halt.
Now, he saw his action in its true light, and it filled him with
horror. He hailed a passing cab, and said to the driver:</p>

<p>"Go to the police-office, and bring the commissary. Hurry! There
has been a murder in that house."</p>

<p>The cabdriver whipped his horse. Charles wished to return to the
house, but found the gate locked. He had closed it himself when he
came out, and it could not be opened from the outside. On the other
hand, it was useless to ring, as there was no one in the house.</p>

<p>It was almost an hour before the arrival of the police. When
they came, Charles told his story and handed the banknotes to the
commissary. A locksmith was summoned, and, after considerable
difficulty, he succeeded in forcing open the garden gate and the
vestibule door. The commissary of police entered the room first,
but, immediately, turned to Charles and said:</p>

<p>"You told me that the room was in the greatest disorder."</p>

<p>Charles stood at the door, amazed, bewildered; all the furniture
had been restored to its accustomed place. The small table was
standing between the two windows, the chairs were upright, and the
clock was on the centre of the mantel. The debris of the candelabra
had been removed.</p>

<p>"Where is...Monsieur le Baron?" stammered Charles.</p>

<p>"That's so!" exclaimed the officer, "where is the victim?"</p>

<p>He approached the bed, and drew aside a large sheet, under which
reposed the Baron d'Hautrec, formerly French Ambassador at Berlin.
Over him, lay his military coat, adorned with the Cross of Honor.
His features were calm. His eyes were closed.</p>

<p>"Someone has been here," said Charles.</p>

<p>"How did they get in?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, but someone has been here during my absence.
There was a stiletto on the floor&mdash;there! And a handkerchief,
stained with blood, on the bed. They are not here now. They have
been carried away. And someone has put the room in order."</p>

<p>"Who would do that?"</p>

<p>"The assassin."</p>

<p>"But we found all the doors locked."</p>

<p>"He must have remained in the house."</p>

<p>"Then he must be here yet, as you were in front of the house all
the time."</p>

<p>Charles reflected a moment, then said, slowly:</p>

<p>"Yes...of course...I didn't go away from the gate."</p>

<p>"Who was the last person you saw with the baron?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Antoinette, his secretary."</p>

<p>"What has become of her?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Her bed wasn't occupied, so she must have gone
out. I am not surprised at that, as she is young and pretty."</p>

<p>"But how could she leave the house?"</p>

<p>"By the door," said Charles.</p>

<p>"But you had bolted and chained it."</p>

<p>"Yes, but she must have left before that."</p>

<p>"And the crime was committed after her departure?"</p>

<p>"Of course," said the servant.</p>

<p>The house was searched from cellar to garret, but the assassin
had fled. How? And when? Was it he or an accomplice who had
returned to the scene of the crime and removed everything that
might furnish a clue to his identity? Such were the questions the
police were called upon to solve.</p>

<p>The coroner came at seven o'clock; and, at eight o'clock, Mon.
Dudouis, the head of the detective service, arrived on the scene.
They were followed by the Procureur of the Republic and the
investigating magistrate. In addition to these officials, the house
was overrun with policemen, detectives, newspaper reporters,
photographers, and relatives and acquaintances of the murdered
man.</p>

<p>A thorough search was made; they studied out the position of the
corpse according to the information furnished by Charles; they
questioned Sister Auguste when she arrived; but they discovered
nothing new. Sister Auguste was astonished to learn of the
disappearance of Antoinette Bréhat. She had engaged the young girl
twelve days before, on excellent recommendations, and refused to
believe that she would neglect her duty by leaving the house during
the night.</p>

<p>"But, you see, she hasn't returned yet," said the magistrate,
"and we are still confronted with the question: What has become of
her?"</p>

<p>"I think she was abducted by the assassin," said Charles.</p>

<p>The theory was plausible, and was borne out by certain facts.
Mon. Dudouis agreed with it. He said:</p>

<p>"Abducted? <i>ma foi!</i> that is not improbable."</p>

<p>"Not only improbable," said a voice, "but absolutely opposed to
the facts. There is not a particle of evidence to support such a
theory."</p>

<p>The voice was harsh, the accent sharp, and no one was surprised
to learn that the speaker was Ganimard. In no one else, would they
tolerate such a domineering tone.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is you, Ganimard!" exclaimed Mon. Dudouis. "I had not
seen you before."</p>

<p>"I have been here since two o'clock."</p>

<p>"So you are interested in some things outside of lottery ticket
number 514, the affair of the rue Clapeyron, the blonde lady and
Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"Ha-ha!" laughed the veteran detective. "I would not say that
Lupin is a stranger to the present case. But let us forget the
affair of the lottery ticket for a few moments, and try to unravel
this new mystery."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Ganimard is not one of those celebrated detectives whose methods
will create a school, or whose name will be immortalized in the
criminal annals of his country. He is devoid of those flashes of
genius which characterize the work of Dupin, Lecoq and Sherlock
Holmes. Yet, it must be admitted, he possesses superior qualities
of observation, sagacity, perseverance and even intuition. His
merit lies in his absolute independence. Nothing troubles or
influences him, except, perhaps, a sort of fascination that Arsène
Lupin holds over him. However that may be, there is no doubt that
his position on that morning, in the house of the late Baron
d'Hautrec, was one of undoubted superiority, and his collaboration
in the case was appreciated and desired by the investigating
magistrate.</p>

<p>"In the first place," said Ganimard, "I will ask Monsieur
Charles to be very particular on one point: He says that, on the
occasion of his first visit to the room, various articles of
furniture were overturned and strewn about the place; now, I ask
him whether, on his second visit to the room, he found all those
articles restored to their accustomed places&mdash;I mean, of
course, correctly placed."</p>

<p>"Yes, all in their proper places," replied Charles.</p>

<p>"It is obvious, then, that the person who replaced them must
have been familiar with the location of those articles."</p>

<p>The logic of this remark was apparent to his hearers. Ganimard
continued:</p>

<p>"One more question, Monsieur Charles. You were awakened by the
ringing of your bell. Now, who, do you think, rang it?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur le baron, of course."</p>

<p>"When could he ring it?"</p>

<p>"After the struggle...when he was dying."</p>

<p>"Impossible; because you found him lying, unconscious, at a
point more than four metres from the bell-button."</p>

<p>"Then he must have rung during the struggle."</p>

<p>"Impossible," declared Ganimard, "since the ringing, as you have
said, was continuous and uninterrupted, and lasted seven or eight
seconds. Do you think his antagonist would have permitted him to
ring the bell in that leisurely manner?"</p>

<p>"Well, then, it was before the attack."</p>

<p>"Also, quite impossible, since you have told us that the lapse
of time between the ringing of the bell and your entrance to the
room was not more than three minutes. Therefore, if the baron rang
before the attack, we are forced to the conclusion that the
struggle, the murder and the flight of the assassin, all occurred
within the short space of three minutes. I repeat: that is
impossible."</p>

<p>"And yet," said the magistrate, "someone rang. If it were not
the baron, who was it?"</p>

<p>"The murderer."</p>

<p>"For what purpose?"</p>

<p>"I do not know. But the fact that he did ring proves that he
knew that the bell communicated with the servant's room. Now, who
would know that, except an inmate of the house?"</p>

<p>Ganimard was drawing the meshes of his net closer and tighter.
In a few clear and logical sentences, he had unfolded and defined
his theory of the crime, so that it seemed quite natural when the
magistrate said:</p>

<p>"As I understand it, Ganimard, you suspect the girl Antoinette
Bréhat?"</p>

<p>"I do not suspect her; I accuse her."</p>

<p>"You accuse her of being an accomplice?"</p>

<p>"I accuse her of having killed Baron d'Hautrec."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! What proof have you?"</p>

<p>"The handful of hair I found in the right hand of the
victim."</p>

<p>He produced the hair; it was of a beautiful blond color, and
glittered like threads of gold. Charles looked at it, and said:</p>

<p>"That is Mademoiselle Antoinette's hair. There can be no doubt
of it. And, then, there is another thing. I believe that the knife,
which I saw on my first visit to the room, belonged to her. She
used it to cut the leaves of books."</p>

<p>A long, dreadful silence followed, as if the crime had acquired
an additional horror by reason of having been committed by a woman.
At last, the magistrate said:</p>

<p>"Let us assume, until we are better informed, that the baron was
killed by Antoinette Bréhat. We have yet to learn where she
concealed herself after the crime, how she managed to return after
Charles left the house, and how she made her escape after the
arrival of the police. Have you formed any opinion on those points
Ganimard?"</p>

<p>"None."</p>

<p>"Well, then, where do we stand?"</p>

<p>Ganimard was embarrassed. Finally, with a visible effort, he
said:</p>

<p>"All I can say is that I find in this case the same method of
procedure as we found in the affair of the lottery ticket number
514; the same phenomena, which might be termed the faculty of
disappearing. Antoinette Bréhat has appeared and disappeared in
this house as mysteriously as Arsène Lupin entered the house of
Monsieur Detinan and escaped therefrom in the company of the blonde
lady."</p>

<p>"Does that signify anything?"</p>

<p>"It does to me. I can see a probable connection between those
two strange incidents. Antoinette Bréhat was hired by Sister
Auguste twelve days ago, that is to say, on the day after the
blonde Lady so cleverly slipped through my fingers. In the second
place, the hair of the blonde Lady was exactly of the same
brilliant golden hue as the hair found in this case."</p>

<p>"So that, in your opinion, Antoinette Bréhat&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is the blonde Lady&mdash;precisely."</p>

<p>"And that Lupin had a hand in both cases?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that is my opinion."</p>

<p>This statement was greeted with an outburst of laughter. It came
from Mon. Dudouis.</p>

<p>"Lupin! always Lupin! Lupin is into everything; Lupin is
everywhere!"</p>

<p>"Yes, Lupin is into everything of any consequence," replied
Ganimard, vexed at the ridicule of his superior.</p>

<p>"Well, so far as I see," observed Mon. Dudouis, "you have not
discovered any motive for this crime. The secretary was not broken
into, nor the pocketbook carried away. Even, a pile of gold was
left upon the table."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is so," exclaimed Ganimard, "but the famous
diamond?"</p>

<p>"What diamond?"</p>

<p>"The blue diamond! The celebrated diamond which formed part of
the royal crown of France, and which was given by the Duke d'Aumale
to Leonide Lebrun, and, at the death of Leonide Lebrun, was
purchased by the Baron d'Hautrec as a souvenir of the charming
comedienne that he had loved so well. That is one of those things
that an old Parisian, like I, does not forget."</p>

<p>"It is obvious that if the blue diamond is not found, the motive
for the crime is disclosed," said the magistrate. "But where should
we search for it?"</p>

<p>"On the baron's finger," replied Charles. "He always wore the
blue diamond on his left hand."</p>

<p>"I saw that hand, and there was only a plain gold ring on it,"
said Ganimard, as he approached the corpse.</p>

<p>"Look in the palm of the hand," replied the servant.</p>

<p>Ganimard opened the stiffened hand. The bezel was turned inward,
and, in the centre of that bezel, the blue diamond shone with all
its glorious splendor.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" muttered Ganimard, absolutely amazed, "I don't
understand it."</p>

<p>"You will now apologize to Lupin for having suspected him, eh?"
said Mon. Dudouis, laughing.</p>

<p>Ganimard paused for a moment's reflection, and then replied,
sententiously:</p>

<p>"It is only when I do not understand things that I suspect
Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>Such were the facts established by the police on the day after
the commission of that mysterious crime. Facts that were vague and
incoherent in themselves, and which were not explained by any
subsequent discoveries. The movements of Antoinette Bréhat remained
as inexplicable as those of the blonde Lady, and the police
discovered no trace of that mysterious creature with the golden
hair who had killed Baron d'Hautrec and had failed to take from his
finger the famous diamond that had once shone in the royal crown of
France.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The heirs of the Baron d'Hautrec could not fail to benefit by
such notoriety. They established in the house an exhibition of the
furniture and other objects which were to be sold at the auction
rooms of Drouot &amp; Co. Modern furniture of indifferent taste,
various objects of no artistic value...but, in the centre of the
room, in a case of purple velvet, protected by a glass globe, and
guarded by two officers, was the famous blue diamond ring.</p>

<p>A large magnificent diamond of incomparable purity, and of that
indefinite blue which the clear water receives from an unclouded
sky, of that blue which can be detected in the whiteness of linen.
Some admired, some enthused...and some looked with horror on the
chamber of the victim, on the spot where the corpse had lain, on
the floor divested of its bloodstained carpet, and especially the
walls, the unsurmountable walls over which the criminal must have
passed. Some assured themselves that the marble mantel did not
move, others imagined gaping holes, mouths of tunnels, secret
connections with the sewers, and the catacombs&mdash;</p>

<p>The sale of the blue diamond took place at the salesroom of
Drouot &amp; Co. The place was crowded to suffocation, and the
bidding was carried to the verge of folly. The sale was attended by
all those who usually appear at similar events in Paris; those who
buy, and those who make a pretense of being able to buy; bankers,
brokers, artists, women of all classes, two cabinet ministers, an
Italian tenor, an exiled king who, in order to maintain his credit,
bid, with much ostentation, and in a loud voice, as high as one
hundred thousand francs. One hundred thousand francs! He could
offer that sum without any danger of his bid being accepted. The
Italian tenor risked one hundred and fifty thousand, and a member
of the Comédie-Française bid one hundred and seventy-five thousand
francs.</p>

<p>When the bidding reached two hundred thousand francs, the
smaller competitors fell out of the race. At two hundred and fifty
thousand, only two bidders remained in the field: Herschmann, the
well-known capitalist, the king of gold mines; and the Countess de
Crozon, the wealthy American, whose collection of diamonds and
precious stones is famed throughout the world.</p>

<p>"Two hundred and sixty thousand...two hundred and seventy
thousand...seventy-five...eighty..." exclaimed the auctioneer, as
he glanced at the two competitors in succession. "Two hundred and
eighty thousand for madame...Do I hear any more?"</p>

<p>"Three hundred thousand," said Herschmann.</p>

<p>There was a short silence. The countess was standing, smiling,
but pale from excitement. She was leaning against the back of the
chair in front of her. She knew, and so did everyone present, that
the issue of the duel was certain; logically, inevitably, it must
terminate to the advantage of the capitalist, who had untold
millions with which to indulge his caprices. However, the countess
made another bid:</p>

<p>"Three hundred and five thousand."</p>

<p>Another silence. All eyes were now directed to the capitalist in
the expectation that he would raise the bidding. But Herschmann was
not paying any attention to the sale; his eyes were fixed on a
sheet of paper which he held in his right hand, while the other
hand held a torn envelope.</p>

<p>"Three hundred and five thousand," repeated the auctioneer.
"Once!...Twice!...For the last time...Do I hear any
more?...Once!...Twice!...Am I offered any more? Last
chance!..."</p>

<p>Herschmann did not move.</p>

<p>"Third and last time!...Sold!" exclaimed the auctioneer, as his
hammer fell.</p>

<p>"Four hundred thousand," cried Herschman, starting up, as if the
sound of the hammer had roused him from his stupor.</p>

<p>Too late; the auctioneer's decision was irrevocable. Some of
Herschmann's acquaintances pressed around him. What was the matter?
Why did he not speak sooner? He laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"<i>Ma foi!</i> I simply forgot&mdash;in a moment of
abstraction."</p>

<p>"That is strange."</p>

<p>"You see, I just received a letter."</p>

<p>"And that letter was sufficient&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To distract my attention? Yes, for a moment."</p>

<p>Ganimard was there. He had come to witness the sale of the ring.
He stopped one of the attendants of the auction room, and said:</p>

<p>"Was it you who carried the letter to Monsieur Herschmann?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who gave it to you?"</p>

<p>"A lady."</p>

<p>"Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Where is she?...She was sitting down there...the lady who wore
a thick veil."</p>

<p>"She has gone?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just this moment."</p>

<p>Ganimard hastened to the door, and saw the lady descending the
stairs. He ran after her. A crush of people delayed him at the
entrance. When he reached the sidewalk, she had disappeared. He
returned to the auction room, accosted Herschmann, introduced
himself, and enquired about the letter. Herschmann handed it to
him. It was carelessly scribbled in pencil, in a handwriting
unknown to the capitalist, and contained these few words:</p>

<p class="letter">"The blue diamond brings misfortune. Remember the
Baron d'Hautrec."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The vicissitudes of the blue diamond were not yet at an end.
Although it had become well-known through the murder of the Baron
d'Hautrec and the incidents at the auction-rooms, it was six months
later that it attained even greater celebrity. During the following
summer, the Countess de Crozon was robbed of the famous jewel she
had taken so much trouble to acquire.</p>

<p>Let me recall that strange affair, of which the exciting and
dramatic incidents sent a thrill through all of us, and over which
I am now permitted to throw some light.</p>

<p>On the evening of August 10, the guests of the Count and
Countess de Crozon were assembled in the drawing-room of the
magnificent château which overlooks the Bay de Somme. To entertain
her friends, the countess seated herself at the piano to play for
them, after first placing her jewels on a small table near the
piano, and, amongst them, was the ring of the Baron d'Hautrec.</p>

<p>An hour later, the count and the majority of the guests retired,
including his two cousins and Madame de Réal, an intimate friend of
the countess. The latter remained in the drawing-room with Herr
Bleichen, the Austrian consul, and his wife.</p>

<p>They conversed for a time, and then the countess extinguished
the large lamp that stood on a table in the centre of the room. At
the same moment, Herr Bleichen extinguished the two piano lamps.
There was a momentary darkness; then the consul lighted a candle,
and the three of them retired to their rooms. But, as soon as she
reached her apartment, the countess remembered her jewels and sent
her maid to get them. When the maid returned with the jewels, she
placed them on the mantel without the countess looking at them.
Next day, Madame de Crozon found that one of her rings was missing;
it was the blue diamond ring.</p>

<p>She informed her husband, and, after talking it over, they
reached the conclusion that the maid was above suspicion, and that
the guilty party must be Herr Bleichen.</p>

<p>The count notified the commissary of police at Amiens, who
commenced an investigation and, discreetly, exercised a strict
surveillance over the Austrian consul to prevent his disposing of
the ring.</p>

<p>The château was surrounded by detectives day and night. Two
weeks passed without incident. Then Herr Bleichen announced his
intended departure. That day, a formal complaint was entered
against him. The police made an official examination of his
luggage. In a small satchel, the key to which was always carried by
the consul himself, they found a bottle of dentifrice, and in that
bottle they found the ring.</p>

<p>Madame Bleichen fainted. Her husband was placed under
arrest.</p>

<p>Everyone will remember the line of defense adopted by the
accused man. He declared that the ring must have been placed there
by the Count de Crozen as an act of revenge. He said:</p>

<p>"The count is brutal and makes his wife very unhappy. She
consulted me, and I advised her to get a divorce. The count heard
of it in some way, and, to be revenged on me, he took the ring and
placed it in my satchel."</p>

<p>The count and countess persisted in pressing the charge. Between
the explanation which they gave and that of the consul, both
equally possible and equally probable, the public had to choose. No
new fact was discovered to turn the scale in either direction. A
month of gossip, conjectures and investigations failed to produce a
single ray of light.</p>

<p>Wearied of the excitement and notoriety, and incapable of
securing the evidence necessary to sustain their charge against the
consul, the count and countess at last sent to Paris for a
detective competent to unravel the tangled threads of this
mysterious skein. This brought Ganimard into the case.</p>

<p>For four days, the veteran detective searched the house from top
to bottom, examined every foot of the ground, had long conferences
with the maid, the chauffeur, the gardeners, the employees in the
neighboring post-offices, visited the rooms that had been occupied
by the various guests. Then, one morning, he disappeared without
taking leave of his host or hostess. But a week later, they
received this telegram:</p>

<p class="letter">"Please come to the Japanese Tearoom, rue Boissy-d'Anglas,
tomorrow, Friday, evening at five o'clock. Ganimard."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At five o'clock, Friday evening, their automobile stopped in
front of number nine rue Boissy-d'Anglas. The old detective was
standing on the sidewalk, waiting for them. Without a word, he
conducted them to the first floor of the Japanese Tearoom. In one
of the rooms, they met two men, whom Ganimard introduced in these
words:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Gerbois, professor in the College of Versailles, from
whom, you will remember, Arsène Lupin stole half a million;
Monsieur Léonce d'Hautrec, nephew and sole legatee of the Baron
d'Hautrec."</p>

<p>A few minutes later, another man arrived. It was Mon. Dudouis,
head of the detective service, and he appeared to be in a
particularly bad temper. He bowed, and then said:</p>

<p>"What's the trouble now, Ganimard? I received your telephone
message asking me to come here. Is it anything of consequence?"</p>

<p>"Yes, chief, it is a very important matter. Within an hour, the
last two cases to which I was assigned will have their dénouement
here. It seemed to me that your presence was indispensable."</p>

<p>"And also the presence of Dieuzy and Folenfant, whom I noticed
standing near the door as I came in?"</p>

<p>"Yes, chief."</p>

<p>"For what? Are you going to make an arrest, and you wish to do
it with a flourish? Come, Ganimard, I am anxious to hear about
it."</p>

<p>Ganimard hesitated a moment, then spoke with the obvious
intention of making an impression on his hearers:</p>

<p>"In the first place, I wish to state that Herr Bleichen had
nothing to do with the theft of the ring."</p>

<p>"Oh! oh!" exclaimed Mon. Dudouis, "that is a bold statement and
a very serious one."</p>

<p>"And is that all you have discovered?" asked the Count de
Crozon.</p>

<p>"Not at all. On the second day after the theft, three of your
guests went on an automobile trip as far as Crécy. Two of them
visited the famous battlefield; and, while they were there, the
third party paid a hasty visit to the post-office, and mailed a
small box, tied and sealed according to the regulations, and
declared its value to be one hundred francs."</p>

<p>"I see nothing strange in that," said the count.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you will see something strange in it when I tell you
that this person, in place of giving her true name, sent the box
under the name of Rousseau, and the person to whom it was
addressed, a certain Monsieur Beloux of Paris, moved his place of
residence immediately after receiving the box, in other words, the
ring."</p>

<p>"I presume you refer to one of my cousins d'Andelle?"</p>

<p>"No," replied Ganimard.</p>

<p>"Madame de Réal, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You accuse my friend, Madam de Réal?" cried the countess,
shocked and amazed.</p>

<p>"I wish to ask you one question, madame," said Ganimard. "Was
Madam de Réal present when you purchased the ring?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but we did not go there together."</p>

<p>"Did she advise you to buy the ring?"</p>

<p>The countess considered for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she mentioned it first&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, madame. Your answer establishes the fact that it was
Madame de Réal who was the first to mention the ring, and it was
she who advised you to buy it."</p>

<p>"But, I consider my friend is quite incapable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, countess, when I remind you that Madame de Réal is
only a casual acquaintance and not your intimate friend, as the
newspapers have announced. It was only last winter that you met her
for the first time. Now, I can prove that everything she has told
you about herself, her past life, and her relatives, is absolutely
false; that Madame Blanche de Réal had no actual existence before
she met you, and she has now ceased to exist."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well?" replied Ganimard.</p>

<p>"Your story is a very strange one," said the countess, "but it
has no application to our case. If Madame de Réal had taken the
ring, how do you explain the fact that it was found in Herr
Bleichen's tooth-powder? Anyone who would take the risk and trouble
of stealing the blue diamond would certainly keep it. What do you
say to that?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;nothing&mdash;but Madame de Réal will answer it."</p>

<p>"Oh! she does exist, then?"</p>

<p>"She does&mdash;and does not. I will explain in a few words.
Three days ago, while reading a newspaper, I glanced over the list
of hotel arrivals at Trouville, and there I read: 'Hôtel
Beaurivage&mdash;Madame de Réal, etc.'</p>

<p>"I went to Trouville immediately, and interviewed the proprietor
of the hotel. From the description and other information I received
from him, I concluded that she was the very Madame de Réal that I
was seeking; but she had left the hotel, giving her address in
Paris as number three rue de Colisée. The day before yesterday I
went to that address, and learned that there was no person there
called Madame de Réal, but there was a Madame Réal, living on the
second floor, who acted as a diamond broker and was frequently away
from home. She had returned from a journey on the preceding
evening. Yesterday, I called on her and, under an assumed name, I
offered to act as an intermedium in the sale of some diamonds to
certain wealthy friends of mine. She is to meet me here today to
carry out that arrangement."</p>

<p>"What! You expect her to come here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, at half-past five."</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is she?"</p>

<p>"Madame de Réal of the Château de Crozon? Certainly. I have
convincing evidence of that fact. But...listen!...I hear
Folenfant's signal."</p>

<p>It was a whistle. Ganimard arose quickly.</p>

<p>"There is no time to lose. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, will
you be kind enough to go into the next room. You also, Monsieur
d'Hautrec, and you, Monsieur Gerbois. The door will remain open,
and when I give the signal, you will come out. Of course, Chief,
you will remain here."</p>

<p>"We may be disturbed by other people," said Mon. Dudouis.</p>

<p>"No. This is a new establishment, and the proprietor is one of
my friends. He will not let anyone disturb us&mdash;except the
blonde Lady."</p>

<p>"The blonde Lady! What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the blonde Lady herself, chief; the friend and accomplice
of Arsène Lupin, the mysterious blonde Lady against whom I hold
convincing evidence; but, in addition to that, I wish to confront
her with all the people she has robbed."</p>

<p>He looked through the window.</p>

<p>"I see her. She is coming in the door now. She can't escape:
Folenfant and Dieuzy are guarding the door...The blonde Lady is
captured at last, Chief!"</p>

<p>A moment later a woman appeared at the door; she was tall and
slender, with a very pale complexion and bright golden hair.
Ganimard trembled with excitement; he could not move, nor utter a
word. She was there, in front of him, at his mercy! What a victory
over Arsène Lupin! And what a revenge! And, at the same time, the
victory was such an easy one that he asked himself if the blonde
Lady would not yet slip through his fingers by one of those
miracles that usually terminated the exploits of Arsène Lupin. She
remained standing near the door, surprised at the silence, and
looked about her without any display of suspicion or fear.</p>

<p>"She will get away! She will disappear!" thought Ganimard.</p>

<p>Then he managed to get between her and the door. She turned to
go out.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said. "Why are you going away?"</p>

<p>"Really, monsieur, I do not understand what this means. Allow
me&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There is no reason why you should go, madame, and very good
reasons why you should remain."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It is useless, madame. You cannot go."</p>

<p>Trembling, she sat on a chair, and stammered:</p>

<p>"What is it you want?"</p>

<p>Ganimard had won the battle and captured the blonde Lady. He
said to her:</p>

<p>"Allow me to present the friend I mentioned, who desires to
purchase some diamonds. Have you procured the stones you promised
to bring?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;I don't know. I don't remember."</p>

<p>"Come! Jog your memory! A person of your acquaintance intended
to send you a tinted stone...'Something like the blue diamond,' I
said, laughing; and you replied: 'Exactly, I expect to have just
what you want.' Do you remember?"</p>

<p>She made no reply. A small satchel fell from her hand. She
picked it up quickly, and held it securely. Her hands trembled
slightly.</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ganimard, "I see you have no confidence in us,
Madame de Réal. I shall set you a good example by showing you what
I have."</p>

<p>He took from his pocketbook a paper which he unfolded, and
disclosed a lock of hair.</p>

<p>"These are a few hairs torn from the head of Antoinette Bréhat
by the Baron d'Hautrec, which I found clasped in his dead hand. I
have shown them to Mlle. Gerbois, who declares they are of the
exact color of the hair of the blonde Lady. Besides, they are
exactly the color of your hair&mdash;the identical color."</p>

<p>Madame Réal looked at him in bewilderment, as if she did not
understand his meaning. He continued:</p>

<p>"And here are two perfume bottles, without labels, it is true,
and empty, but still sufficiently impregnated with their odor to
enable Mlle. Gerbois to recognize in them the perfume used by that
blonde Lady who was her traveling companion for two weeks. Now, one
of these bottles was found in the room that Madame de Réal occupied
at the Château de Crozon, and the other in the room that you
occupied at the Hôtel Beaurivage."</p>

<p>"What do you say?...The blonde Lady...the Château de
Crozon..."</p>

<p>The detective did not reply. He took from his pocket and placed
on the table, side by side, four small sheets of paper. Then he
said:</p>

<p>"I have, on these four pieces of paper, various specimens of
handwriting; the first is the writing of Antoinette Bréhat; the
second was written by the woman who sent the note to Baron
Herschmann at the auction sale of the blue diamond; the third is
that of Madame de Réal, written while she was stopping at the
Château de Crozon; and the fourth is your handwriting, madame...it
is your name and address, which you gave to the porter of the Hôtel
Beaurivage at Trouville. Now, compare the four handwritings. They
are identical."</p>

<p>"What absurdity is this? really, monsieur, I do not understand.
What does it mean?"</p>

<p>"It means, madame," exclaimed Ganimard, "that the blonde Lady,
the friend and accomplice of Arsène Lupin, is none other than you,
Madame Réal."</p>

<p>Ganimard went to the adjoining room and returned with Mon.
Gerbois, whom he placed in front of Madame Réal, as he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Gerbois, is this the person who abducted your
daughter, the woman you saw at the house of Monsieur Detinan?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ganimard was so surprised that he could not speak for a moment;
finally, he said: "No?...You must be mistaken..."</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken. Madame is blonde, it is true, and in that
respect resembles the blonde Lady; but, in all other respects, she
is totally different."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it. You must be mistaken."</p>

<p>Ganimard called in his other witnesses.</p>

<p>"Monsieur d'Hautrec," he said, "do you recognize Antoinette
Bréhat?"</p>

<p>"No, this is not the person I saw at my uncle's house."</p>

<p>"This woman is not Madame de Réal," declared the Count de
Crozon.</p>

<p>That was the finishing touch. Ganimard was crushed. He was
buried beneath the ruins of the structure he had erected with so
much care and assurance. His pride was humbled, his spirit was
broken, by the force of this unexpected blow.</p>

<p>Mon. Dudouis arose, and said:</p>

<p>"We owe you an apology, madame, for this unfortunate mistake.
But, since your arrival here, I have noticed your nervous
agitation. Something troubles you; may I ask what it is?"</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, monsieur, I was afraid. My satchel contains
diamonds to the value of a hundred thousand francs, and the conduct
of your friend was rather suspicious."</p>

<p>"But you were frequently absent from Paris. How do you explain
that?"</p>

<p>"I make frequent journeys to other cities in the course of my
business. That is all."</p>

<p>Mon. Dudouis had nothing more to ask. He turned to his
subordinate, and said:</p>

<p>"Your investigation has been very superficial, Ganimard, and
your conduct toward this lady is really deplorable. You will come
to my office tomorrow and explain it."</p>

<p>The interview was at an end, and Mon. Dudouis was about to leave
the room when a most annoying incident occurred. Madame Réal turned
to Ganimard, and said:</p>

<p>"I understand that you are Monsieur Ganimard. Am I right?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then, this letter must be for you. I received it this morning.
It was addressed to 'Mon. Justin Ganimard, care of Madame Réal.' I
thought it was a joke, because I did not know you under that name,
but it appears that your unknown correspondent knew of our
rendezvous."</p>

<p>Ganimard was inclined to put the letter in his pocket unread,
but he dared not do so in the presence of his superior, so he
opened the envelope and read the letter aloud, in an almost
inaudible tone:</p>

<p class="letter">Once upon a time, there were a blonde Lady, a
Lupin, and a Ganimard. Now, the wicked Ganimard had evil designs on
the pretty blonde Lady, and the good Lupin was her friend and
protector. When the good Lupin wished the blonde Lady to become the
friend of the Countess de Crozon, he caused her to assume the name
of Madame de Réal, which is a close resemblance to the name of a
certain diamond broker, a woman with a pale complexion and golden
hair. And the good Lupin said to himself: If ever the wicked
Ganimard gets upon the track of the blonde Lady, how useful it will
be to me if he should be diverted to the track of the honest
diamond broker. A wise precaution that has borne good fruit. A
little note sent to the newspaper read by the wicked Ganimard, a
perfume bottle intentionally forgotten by the genuine blonde Lady
at the Hôtel Beaurivage, the name and address of Madame Réal
written on the hotel register by the genuine blonde Lady, and the
trick is played. What do you think of it, Ganimard? I wished to
tell you the true story of this affair, knowing that you would be
the first to laugh over it. Really, it is quite amusing, and I have
enjoyed it very much.<br>
<br>
Accept my best wishes, dear friend, and give my kind regards to the
worthy Mon. Dudouis.<br>
<br>
Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"He knows everything," muttered Ganimard, but he did not see the
humor of the situation as Lupin had predicted. "He knows some
things I have never mentioned to anyone. How could he find out that
I was going to invite you here, chief? How could he know that I had
found the first perfume bottle? How could he find out those
things?"</p>

<p>He stamped his feet and tore his hair&mdash;a prey to the most
tragic despair. Mon. Dudouis felt sorry for him, and said:</p>

<p>"Come, Ganimard, never mind; try to do better next time."</p>

<p>And Mon. Dudouis left the room, accompanied by Madame Réal.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>During the next ten minutes, Ganimard read and reread the letter
of Arsène Lupin. Monsieur and Madame de Crozon, Monsieur d'Hautrec
and Monsieur Gerbois were holding an animated discussion in a
corner of the room. At last, the count approached the detective,
and said:</p>

<p>"My dear monsieur, after your investigation, we are no nearer
the truth than we were before."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, but my investigation has established these facts:
that the blonde Lady is the mysterious heroine of these exploits,
and that Arsène Lupin directed them."</p>

<p>"Those facts do not solve the mystery; in fact, they render it
more obscure. The blonde Lady commits a murder in order to steal
the blue diamond, and yet she does not steal it. Afterward she
steals it and gets rid of it by secretly giving it to another
person. How do you explain her strange conduct?"</p>

<p>"I cannot explain it."</p>

<p>"Of course; but, perhaps, someone else can."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>The Count hesitated, so the Countess replied, frankly:</p>

<p>"There is only one man besides yourself who is competent to
enter the arena with Arsène Lupin and overcome him. Have you any
objection to our engaging the services of Herlock Sholmes in this
case?"</p>

<p>Ganimard was vexed at the question, but stammered a reply:</p>

<p>"No...but...I do not understand what&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Let me explain. All this mystery annoys me. I wish to have it
cleared up. Monsieur Gerbois and Monsieur d'Hautrec have the same
desire, and we have agreed to send for the celebrated English
detective."</p>

<p>"You are right, madame," replied the detective, with a loyalty
that did him credit, "you are right. Old Ganimard is not able to
overcome Arsène Lupin. But will Herlock Sholmes succeed? I hope so,
as I have the greatest admiration for him. But...it is
improbable."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that he will not succeed?"</p>

<p>"That is my opinion. I can foresee the result of a duel between
Herlock Sholmes and Arsène Lupin. The Englishman will be
defeated."</p>

<p>"But, in any event, can we count on your assistance?"</p>

<p>"Quite so, madame. I shall be pleased to render Monsieur Sholmes
all possible assistance."</p>

<p>"Do you know his address?"</p>

<p>"Yes; 219 Parker street."</p>

<p>That evening Monsieur and Madame de Crozon withdrew the charge
they had made against Herr Bleichen, and a joint letter was
addressed to Herlock Sholmes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>Chapter 3. Herlock Sholmes Opens
Hostilities</h2>

<p>"What does monsieur wish?"</p>

<p>"Anything," replied Arsène Lupin, like a man who never worries
over the details of a meal; "anything you like, but no meat or
alcohol."</p>

<p>The waiter walked away, disdainfully.</p>

<p>"What! still a vegetarian?" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>"More so than ever," replied Lupin.</p>

<p>"Through taste, faith, or habit?"</p>

<p>"Hygiene."</p>

<p>"And do you never fall from grace?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes...when I am dining out...and wish to avoid being
considered eccentric."</p>

<p>We were dining near the Northern Railway station, in a little
restaurant to which Arsène Lupin had invited me. Frequently he
would send me a telegram asking me to meet him in some obscure
restaurant, where we could enjoy a quiet dinner, well served, and
which was always made interesting to me by his recital of some
startling adventure theretofore unknown to me.</p>

<p>On that particular evening he appeared to be in a more lively
mood than usual. He laughed and joked with careless animation, and
with that delicate sarcasm that was habitual with him&mdash;a light
and spontaneous sarcasm that was quite free from any tinge of
malice. It was a pleasure to find him in that jovial mood, and I
could not resist the desire to tell him so.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," he exclaimed, "there are days in which I find life as
bright and gay as a spring morning; then life seems to be an
infinite treasure which I can never exhaust. And yet God knows I
lead a careless existence!"</p>

<p>"Too much so, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Ah! but I tell you, the treasure is infinite. I can spend it
with a lavish hand. I can cast my youth and strength to the four
winds of Heaven, and it is replaced by a still younger and greater
force. Besides, my life is so pleasant!...If I wished to do so, I
might become&mdash;what shall I say?...An orator, a manufacturer, a
politician...But, I assure you, I shall never have such a desire.
Arsène Lupin, I am; Arsène Lupin, I shall remain. I have made a
vain search in history to find a career comparable to mine; a life
better filled or more intense...Napoleon? Yes, perhaps...But
Napoleon, toward the close of his career, when all Europe was
trying to crush him, asked himself on the eve of each battle if it
would not be his last."</p>

<p>Was he serious? Or was he joking? He became more animated as he
proceeded:</p>

<p>"That is everything, do you understand, the danger! The
continuous feeling of danger! To breathe it as you breathe the air,
to scent it in every breath of wind, to detect it in every unusual
sound...And, in the midst of the tempest, to remain calm...and not
to stumble! Otherwise, you are lost. There is only one sensation
equal to it: that of the chauffeur in an automobile race. But that
race lasts only a few hours; my race continues until death!"</p>

<p>"What fantasy!" I exclaimed. "And you wish me to believe that
you have no particular motive for your adoption of that exciting
life?"</p>

<p>"Come," he said, with a smile, "you are a clever psychologist.
Work it out for yourself."</p>

<p>He poured himself a glass of water, drank it, and said:</p>

<p>"Did you read <i>Le Temps</i> today?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Herlock Sholmes crossed the Channel this afternoon, and arrived
in Paris about six o'clock."</p>

<p>"The deuce! What is he coming for?"</p>

<p>"A little journey he has undertaken at the request of the Count
and Countess of Crozon, Monsieur Gerbois, and the nephew of Baron
d'Hautrec. They met him at the Northern Railway station, took him
to meet Ganimard, and, at this moment, the six of them are holding
a consultation."</p>

<p>Despite a strong temptation to do so, I had never ventured to
question Arsène Lupin concerning any action of his private life,
unless he had first mentioned the subject to me. Up to that moment
his name had not been mentioned, at least officially, in connection
with the blue diamond. Consequently, I consumed my curiosity in
patience. He continued:</p>

<p>"There is also in <i>Le Temps</i> an interview with my old
friend Ganimard, according to whom a certain blonde lady, who
should be my friend, must have murdered the Baron d'Hautrec and
tried to rob Madame de Crozon of her famous ring. And&mdash;what do
you think?&mdash;he accuses me of being the instigator of those
crimes."</p>

<p>I could not suppress a slight shudder. Was this true? Must I
believe that his career of theft, his mode of existence, the
logical result of such a life, had drawn that man into more serious
crimes, including murder? I looked at him. He was so calm, and his
eyes had such a frank expression! I observed his hands: they had
been formed from a model of exceeding delicacy, long and slender;
inoffensive, truly; and the hands of an artist...</p>

<p>"Ganimard has pipe-dreams," I said.</p>

<p>"No, no!" protested Lupin. "Ganimard has some cleverness; and,
at times, almost inspiration."</p>

<p>"Inspiration!"</p>

<p>"Yes. For instance, that interview is a masterstroke. In the
first place, he announces the coming of his English rival in order
to put me on my guard, and make his task more difficult. In the
second place, he indicates the exact point to which he has
conducted the affair in order that Sholmes will not get credit for
the work already done by Ganimard. That is good warfare."</p>

<p>"Whatever it may be, you have two adversaries to deal with, and
such adversaries!"</p>

<p>"Oh! one of them doesn't count."</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"Sholmes? Oh! I confess he is a worthy foe; and that explains my
present good humor. In the first place, it is a question of
self-esteem; I am pleased to know that they consider me a subject
worthy the attention of the celebrated English detective. In the
next place, just imagine the pleasure a man, such as I, must
experience in the thought of a duel with Herlock Sholmes. But I
shall be obliged to strain every muscle; he is a clever fellow, and
will contest every inch of the ground."</p>

<p>"Then you consider him a strong opponent?"</p>

<p>"I do. As a detective, I believe, he has never had an equal. But
I have one advantage over him; he is making the attack and I am
simply defending myself. My role is the easier one. Besides, I am
familiar with his method of warfare, and he does not know mine. I
am prepared to show him a few new tricks that will give him
something to think about."</p>

<p>He tapped the table with his fingers as he uttered the following
sentences, with an air of keen delight:</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin against Herlock Sholmes...France against
England...Trafalgar will be revenged at last...Ah! the
rascal...he doesn't suspect that I am prepared...and a Lupin
warned&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, seized with a fit of coughing, and hid his
face in his napkin, as if something had stuck in his throat.</p>

<p>"A bit of bread?" I inquired. "Drink some water."</p>

<p>"No, it isn't that," he replied, in a stifled voice.</p>

<p>"Then, what is it?"</p>

<p>"The want of air."</p>

<p>"Do you wish a window opened?"</p>

<p>"No, I shall go out. Give me my hat and overcoat, quick! I must
go."</p>

<p>"What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"The two gentlemen who came in just now...Look at the taller
one...now, when we go out, keep to my left, so he will not see
me."</p>

<p>"The one who is sitting behind you?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I will explain it to you, outside."</p>

<p>"Who is it?"</p>

<p>"Herlock Sholmes."</p>

<p>He made a desperate effort to control himself, as if he were
ashamed of his emotion, replaced his napkin, drank a glass of
water, and, quite recovered, said to me, smiling:</p>

<p>"It is strange, <i>hein</i>, that I should be affected so
easily, but that unexpected sight&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What have you to fear, since no one can recognize you, on
account of your many transformations? Every time I see you it seems
to me your face is changed; it's not at all familiar. I don't know
why."</p>

<p>"But he would recognize me," said Lupin. "He has seen me only
once; but, at that time, he made a mental photograph of
me&mdash;not of my external appearance but of my very
soul&mdash;not what I appear to be but just what I am. Do you
understand? And then...and then...I did not expect to meet him
here...Such a strange encounter!...in this little
restaurant..."</p>

<p>"Well, shall we go out?"</p>

<p>"No, not now," said Lupin.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"The better way is to act frankly...to have confidence in
him&mdash;trust him..."</p>

<p>"You will not speak to him?"</p>

<p>"Why not? It will be to my advantage to do so, and find out what
he knows, and, perhaps, what he thinks. At present I have the
feeling that his gaze is on my neck and shoulders, and that he is
trying to remember where he has seen them before."</p>

<p>He reflected a moment. I observed a malicious smile at the
corner of his mouth; then, obedient, I think, to a whim of his
impulsive nature, and not to the necessities of the situation, he
arose, turned around, and, with a bow and a joyous air, he
said:</p>

<p>"By what lucky chance? Ah! I am delighted to see you. Permit me
to introduce a friend of mine."</p>

<p>For a moment the Englishman was disconcerted; then he made a
movement as if he would seize Arsène Lupin. The latter shook his
head, and said:</p>

<p>"That would not be fair; besides, the movement would be an
awkward one and...quite useless."</p>

<p>The Englishman looked about him, as if in search of
assistance.</p>

<p>"No use," said Lupin. "Besides, are you quite sure you can place
your hand on me? Come, now, show me that you are a real Englishman
and, therefore, a good sport."</p>

<p>This advice seemed to commend itself to the detective, for he
partially rose and said, very formally:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Wilson, my friend and assistant&mdash;Monsieur Arsène
Lupin."</p>

<p>Wilson's amazement evoked a laugh. With bulging eyes and gaping
mouth, he looked from one to the other, as if unable to comprehend
the situation. Herlock Sholmes laughed and said:</p>

<p>"Wilson, you should conceal your astonishment at an incident
which is one of the most natural in the world."</p>

<p>"Why do you not arrest him?" stammered Wilson.</p>

<p>"Have you not observed, Wilson, that the gentleman is between me
and the door, and only a few steps from the door. By the time I
could move my little finger he would be outside."</p>

<p>"Don't let that make any difference," said Lupin, who now walked
around the table and seated himself so that the Englishman was
between him and the door&mdash;thus placing himself at the mercy of
the foreigner.</p>

<p>Wilson looked at Sholmes to find out if he had the right to
admire this act of wanton courage. The Englishman's face was
impenetrable; but, a moment later, he called:</p>

<p>"Waiter!"</p>

<p>When the waiter came he ordered soda, beer and whisky. The
treaty of peace was signed&mdash;until further orders. In a few
moments the four men were conversing in an apparently friendly
manner.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes is a man such as you might meet every day in the
business world. He is about fifty years of age, and looks as if he
might have passed his life in an office, adding up columns of dull
figures or writing out formal statements of business accounts.
There was nothing to distinguish him from the average citizen of
London, except the appearance of his eyes, his terribly keen and
penetrating eyes.</p>

<p>But then he is Herlock Sholmes&mdash;which means that he is a
wonderful combination of intuition, observation, clairvoyance and
ingenuity. One could readily believe that nature had been pleased
to take the two most extraordinary detectives that the imagination
of man has hitherto conceived, the Dupin of Edgar Allen Poe and the
Lecoq of Emile Gaboriau, and, out of that material, constructed a
new detective, more extraordinary and supernatural than either of
them. And when a person reads the history of his exploits, which
have made him famous throughout the entire world, he asks himself
whether Herlock Sholmes is not a mythical personage, a fictitious
hero born in the brain of a great novelist&mdash;Conan Doyle, for
instance.</p>

<p>When Arsène Lupin questioned him in regard to the length of his
sojourn in France he turned the conversation into its proper
channel by saying:</p>

<p>"That depends on you, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed Lupin, laughing, "if it depends on me you can
return to England tonight."</p>

<p>"That is a little too soon, but I expect to return in the course
of eight or nine days&mdash;ten at the outside."</p>

<p>"Are you in such a hurry?"</p>

<p>"I have many cases to attend to; such as the robbery of the
Anglo-Chinese Bank, the abduction of Lady Eccleston...But, don't
you think, Monsieur Lupin, that I can finish my business in Paris
within a week?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, if you confine your efforts to the case of the blue
diamond. It is, moreover, the length of time that I require to make
preparations for my safety in case the solution of that affair
should give you certain dangerous advantages over me."</p>

<p>"And yet," said the Englishman, "I expect to close the business
in eight or ten days."</p>

<p>"And arrest me on the eleventh, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"No, the tenth is my limit."</p>

<p>Lupin shook his head thoughtfully, as he said:</p>

<p>"That will be difficult&mdash;very difficult."</p>

<p>"Difficult, perhaps, but possible, therefore certain&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Absolutely certain," said Wilson, as if he had clearly worked
out the long series of operations which would conduct his
collaborator to the desired result.</p>

<p>"Of course," said Herlock Sholmes, "I do not hold all the trump
cards, as these cases are already several months old, and I lack
certain information and clues upon which I am accustomed to base my
investigations."</p>

<p>"Such as spots of mud and cigarette ashes," said Wilson, with an
air of importance.</p>

<p>"In addition to the remarkable conclusions formed by Monsieur
Ganimard, I have obtained all the articles written on the subject,
and have formed a few deductions of my own."</p>

<p>"Some ideas which were suggested to us by analysis or
hypothesis," added Wilson, sententiously.</p>

<p>"I wish to enquire," said Arsène Lupin, in that deferential tone
which he employed in speaking to Sholmes, "would I be indiscreet if
I were to ask you what opinion you have formed about the case?"</p>

<p>Really, it was a most exciting situation to see those two men
facing each other across the table, engaged in an earnest
discussion as if they were obliged to solve some abstruse problem
or come to an agreement upon some controverted fact. Wilson was in
the seventh heaven of delight. Herlock Sholmes filled his pipe
slowly, lighted it, and said:</p>

<p>"This affair is much simpler than it appeared to be at first
sight."</p>

<p>"Much simpler," said Wilson, as a faithful echo.</p>

<p>"I say 'this affair,' for, in my opinion, there is only one,"
said Sholmes. "The death of the Baron d'Hautrec, the story of the
ring, and, let us not forget, the mystery of lottery ticket number
514, are only different phases of what one might call the mystery
of the blonde Lady. Now, according to my view, it is simply a
question of discovering the bond that unites those three episodes
in the same story&mdash;the fact which proves the unity of the
three events. Ganimard, whose judgment is rather superficial, finds
that unity in the faculty of disappearance; that is, in the power
of coming and going unseen and unheard. That theory does not
satisfy me."</p>

<p>"Well, what is your idea?" asked Lupin.</p>

<p>"In my opinion," said Sholmes, "the characteristic feature of
the three episodes is your design and purpose of leading the affair
into a certain channel previously chosen by you. It is, on your
part, more than a plan; it is a necessity, an indispensable
condition of success."</p>

<p>"Can you furnish any details of your theory?"</p>

<p>"Certainly. For example, from the beginning of your conflict
with Monsieur Gerbois, is it not evident that the apartment of
Monsieur Detinan is the place selected by you, the inevitable spot
where all the parties must meet? In your opinion, it was the only
safe place, and you arranged a rendezvous there, publicly, one
might say, for the blonde Lady and Mademoiselle Gerbois."</p>

<p>"The professor's daughter," added Wilson.</p>

<p>"Now, let us consider the case of the blue diamond. Did you try
to appropriate it while the Baron d'Hautrec possessed it? No. But
the baron takes his brother's house. Six months later we have the
intervention of Antoinette Bréhat and the first attempt. The
diamond escapes you, and the sale is widely advertised to take
place at the Drouot auction-rooms. Will it be a free and open sale?
Is the richest amateur sure to carry off the jewel? No. Just as the
banker Herschmann is on the point of buying the ring, a lady sends
him a letter of warning, and it is the Countess de Crozon, prepared
and influenced by the same lady, who becomes the purchaser of the
diamond. Will the ring disappear at once? No; you lack the
opportunity. Therefore, you must wait. At last the Countess goes to
her château. That is what you were waiting for. The ring
disappears."</p>

<p>"To reappear again in the tooth-powder of Herr Bleichen,"
remarked Lupin.</p>

<p>"Oh! such nonsense!" exclaimed Sholmes, striking the table with
his fist, "don't tell me such a fairy tale. I am too old a fox to
be led away by a false scent."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"What do I mean?" said Sholmes, then paused a moment as if he
wished to arrange his effect. At last he said:</p>

<p>"The blue diamond that was found in the tooth-powder was false.
You kept the genuine stone."</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin remained silent for a moment; then, with his eyes
fixed on the Englishman, he replied, calmly:</p>

<p>"You are impertinent, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Impertinent, indeed!" repeated Wilson, beaming with
admiration.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lupin, "and, yet, to do you credit, you have thrown
a strong light on a very mysterious subject. Not a magistrate, not
a special reporter, who has been engaged on this case, has come so
near the truth. It is a marvellous display of intuition and
logic."</p>

<p>"Oh! a person has simply to use his brains," said Herlock
Sholmes, nattered at the homage of the expert criminal.</p>

<p>"And so few have any brains to use," replied Lupin. "And, now,
that the field of conjectures has been narrowed down, and the
rubbish cleared away&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, now, I have simply to discover why the three episodes
were enacted at 25 rue Clapeyron, 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and
within the walls of the Château de Crozon and my work will be
finished. What remains will be child's play. Don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you are right."</p>

<p>"In that case, Monsieur Lupin, am I wrong in saying that my
business will be finished in ten days?"</p>

<p>"In ten days you will know the whole truth," said Lupin.</p>

<p>"And you will be arrested."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No?"</p>

<p>"In order that I may be arrested there must occur such a series
of improbable and unexpected misfortunes that I cannot admit the
possibility of such an event."</p>

<p>"We have a saying in England that 'the unexpected always
happens.'"</p>

<p>They looked at each other for a moment calmly and fearlessly,
without any display of bravado or malice. They met as equals in a
contest of wit and skill. And this meeting was the formal crossing
of swords, preliminary to the duel.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lupin, "at last I shall have an adversary worthy
of the name&mdash;one whose defeat will be the proudest achievement
in my career."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid!" asked Wilson.</p>

<p>"Almost, Monsieur Wilson," replied Lupin, rising from his chair,
"and the proof is that I am about to make a hasty retreat. Then, we
will say ten days, Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ten days. This is Sunday. A week from next Wednesday, at
eight o'clock in the evening, it will be all over."</p>

<p>"And I shall be in prison?"</p>

<p>"No doubt of it."</p>

<p>"Ha! not a pleasant outlook for a man who gets so much enjoyment
out of life as I do. No cares, a lively interest in the affairs of
the world, a justifiable contempt for the police, and the consoling
sympathy of numerous friends and admirers. And now, behold, all
that is about to be changed! It is the reverse side of the medal.
After sunshine comes the rain. It is no longer a laughing matter.
Adieu!"</p>

<p>"Hurry up!" said Wilson, full of solicitude for a person in whom
Herlock Sholmes had inspired so much respect, "do not lose a
minute."</p>

<p>"Not a minute, Monsieur Wilson; but I wish to express my
pleasure at having met you, and to tell you how much I envy the
master in having such a valuable assistant as you seem to be."</p>

<p>Then, after they had courteously saluted each other, like
adversaries in a duel who entertain no feeling of malice but are
obliged to fight by force of circumstances, Lupin seized me by the
arm and drew me outside.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it, dear boy? The strange events of this
evening will form an interesting chapter in the memoirs you are now
preparing for me."</p>

<p>He closed the door of the restaurant behind us, and, after
taking a few steps, he stopped and said:</p>

<p>"Do you smoke?"</p>

<p>"No. Nor do you, it seems to me."</p>

<p>"You are right, I don't."</p>

<p>He lighted a cigarette with a wax-match, which he shook several
times in an effort to extinguish it. But he threw away the
cigarette immediately, ran across the street, and joined two men
who emerged from the shadows as if called by a signal. He conversed
with them for a few minutes on the opposite sidewalk, and then
returned to me.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but I fear that cursed Sholmes is going to
give me trouble. But, I assure you, he is not yet through with
Arsène Lupin. He will find out what kind of fuel I use to warm my
blood. And now&mdash;au revoir! The genial Wilson is right; there
is not a moment to lose."</p>

<p>He walked away rapidly.</p>

<p>Thus ended the events of that exciting evening, or, at least,
that part of them in which I was a participant. Subsequently,
during the course of the evening, other stirring incidents occurred
which have come to my knowledge through the courtesy of other
members of that unique dinner-party.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the very moment in which Lupin left me, Herlock Sholmes rose
from the table, and looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Twenty minutes to nine. At nine o'clock I am to meet the Count
and Countess at the railway station."</p>

<p>"Then, we must be off!" exclaimed Wilson, between two drinks of
whisky.</p>

<p>They left the restaurant.</p>

<p>"Wilson, don't look behind. We may be followed, and, in that
case, let us act as if we did not care. Wilson, I want your
opinion: why was Lupin in that restaurant?"</p>

<p>"To get something to eat," replied Wilson, quickly.</p>

<p>"Wilson, I must congratulate you on the accuracy of your
deduction. I couldn't have done better myself."</p>

<p>Wilson blushed with pleasure, and Sholmes continued:</p>

<p>"To get something to eat. Very well, and, after that, probably,
to assure himself whether I am going to the Château de Crozon, as
announced by Ganimard in his interview. I must go in order not to
disappoint him. But, in order to gain time on him, I shall not
go."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Wilson, nonplussed.</p>

<p>"You, my friend, will walk down this street, take a carriage,
two, three carriages. Return later and get the valises that we left
at the station, and make for the &Egrave;lysée-Palace at a
galop."</p>

<p>"And when I reach the &Egrave;lysée-Palace?"</p>

<p>"Engage a room, go to sleep, and await my orders."</p>

<p>Quite proud of the important role assigned to him, Wilson set
out to perform his task. Herlock Sholmes proceeded to the railway
station, bought a ticket, and repaired to the Amiens' express in
which the Count and Countess de Crozon were already installed. He
bowed to them, lighted his pipe, and had a quiet smoke in the
corridor. The train started. Ten minutes later he took a seat
beside the Countess, and said to her:</p>

<p>"Have you the ring here, madame?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Will you kindly let me see it?"</p>

<p>He took it, and examined it closely.</p>

<p>"Just as I suspected: it is a manufactured diamond."</p>

<p>"A manufactured diamond?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a new process which consists in submitting diamond dust to
a tremendous heat until it melts and is then molded into a single
stone."</p>

<p>"But my diamond is genuine."</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>your</i> diamond is; but this is not yours."</p>

<p>"Where is mine?"</p>

<p>"It is held by Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"And this stone?"</p>

<p>"Was substituted for yours, and slipped into Herr Bleichen's
tooth-powder, where it was afterwards found."</p>

<p>"Then you think this is false?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely false."</p>

<p>The Countess was overwhelmed with surprise and grief, while her
husband scrutinized the diamond with an incredulous air. Finally
she stammered:</p>

<p>"Is it possible? And why did they not merely steal it and be
done with it? And how did they steal it?"</p>

<p>"That is exactly what I am going to find out."</p>

<p>"At the Château de Crozon?"</p>

<p>"No. I shall leave the train at Creil and return to Paris. It is
there the game between me and Arsène Lupin must be played. In fact,
the game has commenced already, and Lupin thinks I am on my way to
the château."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does it matter to you, madame? The essential thing is your
diamond, is it not?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, don't worry. I have just undertaken a much more difficult
task than that. You have my promise that I will restore the true
diamond to you within ten days."</p>

<p>The train slackened its speed. He put the false diamond in his
pocket and opened the door. The Count cried out:</p>

<p>"That is the wrong side of the train. You are getting out on the
tracks."</p>

<p>"That is my intention. If Lupin has anyone on my track, he will
lose sight of me now. Adieu."</p>

<p>An employee protested in vain. After the departure of the train,
the Englishman sought the stationmaster's office. Forty minutes
later he leaped into a train that landed him in Paris shortly
before midnight. He ran across the platform, entered the lunchroom,
made his exit at another door, and jumped into a cab.</p>

<p>"Driver&mdash;rue Clapeyron."</p>

<p>Having reached the conclusion that he was not followed, he
stopped the carriage at the end of the street, and proceeded to
make a careful examination of Monsieur Detinan's house and the two
adjoining houses. He made measurements of certain distances and
entered the figures in his notebook.</p>

<p>"Driver&mdash;avenue Henri-Martin."</p>

<p>At the corner of the avenue and the rue de la Pompe, he
dismissed the carriage, walked down the street to number 134, and
performed the same operations in front of the house of the late
Baron d'Hautrec and the two adjoining houses, measuring the width
of the respective façades and calculating the depth of the little
gardens that stood in front of them.</p>

<p>The avenue was deserted, and was very dark under its four rows
of trees, between which, at considerable intervals, a few gas-lamps
struggled in vain to light the deep shadows. One of them threw a
dim light over a portion of the house, and Sholmes perceived the
"To-let" sign posted on the gate, the neglected walks which
encircled the small lawn, and the large bare windows of the vacant
house.</p>

<p>"I suppose," he said to himself, "the house has been unoccupied
since the death of the baron...Ah! if I could only get in and view
the scene of the murder!"</p>

<p>No sooner did the idea occur to him than he sought to put it in
execution. But how could he manage it? He could not climb over the
gate; it was too high. So he took from his pocket an electric
lantern and a skeleton key which he always carried. Then, to his
great surprise, he discovered that the gate was not locked; in
fact, it was open about three or four inches. He entered the
garden, and was careful to leave the gate as he had found
it&mdash;partly open. But he had not taken many steps from the gate
when he stopped. He had seen a light pass one of the windows on the
second floor.</p>

<p>He saw the light pass a second window and a third, but he saw
nothing else, except a silhouette outlined on the walls of the
rooms. The light descended to the first floor, and, for a long
time, wandered from room to room.</p>

<p>"Who the deuce is walking, at one o'clock in the morning,
through the house in which the Baron d'Hautrec was killed?" Herlock
Sholmes asked himself, deeply interested.</p>

<p>There was only one way to find out, and that was to enter the
house himself. He did not hesitate, but started for the door of the
house. However, at the moment when he crossed the streak of
gaslight that came from the street-lamp, the man must have seen
him, for the light in the house was suddenly extinguished and
Herlock Sholmes did not see it again. Softly, he tried the door. It
was open, also. Hearing no sound, he advanced through the hallway,
encountered the foot of the stairs, and ascended to the first
floor. Here there was the same silence, the same darkness.</p>

<p>He entered, one of the rooms and approached a window through
which came a feeble light from the outside. On looking through the
window he saw the man, who had no doubt descended by another
stairway and escaped by another door. The man was threading his way
through the shrubbery which bordered the wall that separated the
two gardens.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" exclaimed Sholmes, "he is going to escape."</p>

<p>He hastened down the stairs and leaped over the steps in his
eagerness to cut off the man's retreat. But he did not see anyone,
and, owing to the darkness, it was several seconds before he was
able to distinguish a bulky form moving through the shrubbery. This
gave the Englishman food for reflection. Why had the man not made
his escape, which he could have done so easily? Had he remained in
order to watch the movements of the intruder who had disturbed him
in his mysterious work?</p>

<p>"At all events," concluded Sholmes, "it is not Lupin; he would
be more adroit. It may be one of his men."</p>

<p>For several minutes Herlock Sholmes remained motionless, with
his gaze fixed on the adversary who, in his turn was watching the
detective. But as that adversary had become passive, and as the
Englishman was not one to consume his time in idle waiting, he
examined his revolver to see if it was in good working order,
removed his knife from its sheath, and walked toward the enemy with
that cool effrontery and scorn of danger for which he had become
famous.</p>

<p>He heard a clicking sound; it was his adversary preparing his
revolver. Herlock Sholmes dashed boldly into the thicket, and
grappled with his foe. There was a sharp, desperate struggle, in
the course of which Sholmes suspected that the man was trying to
draw a knife. But the Englishman, believing his antagonist to be an
accomplice of Arsène Lupin and anxious to win the first trick in
the game with that redoubtable foe, fought with unusual strength
and determination. He hurled his adversary to the ground, held him
there with the weight of his body, and, gripping him by the throat
with one hand, he used his free hand to take out his electric
lantern, press the button, and throw the light over the face of his
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Wilson!" he exclaimed, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Herlock Sholmes!" stammered a weak, stifled voice.</p>

<p>For a long time they remained silent, astounded, foolish. The
shriek of an automobile rent the air. A slight breeze stirred the
leaves. Suddenly, Herlock Sholmes seized his friend by the
shoulders and shook him violently, as he cried:</p>

<p>"What are you doing here? Tell me...What?...Did I tell you to
hide in the bushes and spy on me?"</p>

<p>"Spy on you!" muttered Wilson, "why, I didn't know it was
you."</p>

<p>"But what are you doing here? You ought to be in bed."</p>

<p>"I was in bed."</p>

<p>"You ought to be asleep."</p>

<p>"I was asleep."</p>

<p>"Well, what brought you here?" asked Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Your letter."</p>

<p>"My letter? I don't understand."</p>

<p>"Yes, a messenger brought it to me at the hotel."</p>

<p>"From me? Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"It is true&mdash;I swear it."</p>

<p>"Where is the letter?"</p>

<p>Wilson handed him a sheet of paper, which he read by the light
of his lantern. It was as follows:</p>

<p class="letter">"Wilson, come at once to avenue Henri-Martin. The house is
empty. Inspect the whole place and make an exact plan. Then return
to hotel.&mdash;Herlock Sholmes."</p>

<p>"I was measuring the rooms," said Wilson, "when I saw a shadow
in the garden. I had only one idea&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was to seize the shadow...The idea was excellent...But
remember this, Wilson, whenever you receive a letter from me, be
sure it is my handwriting and not a forgery."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Wilson, as the truth dawned on him, "then the
letter wasn't from you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Who sent it, then?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"Why? For what purpose?" asked Wilson.</p>

<p>"I don't know, and that's what worries me. I don't understand
why he took the trouble to disturb you. Of course, if he had sent
me on such a foolish errand I wouldn't be surprised; but what was
his object in disturbing you?"</p>

<p>"I must hurry back to the hotel."</p>

<p>"So must I, Wilson."</p>

<p>They arrived at the gate. Wilson, who was ahead, took hold of it
and pulled.</p>

<p>"Ah! you closed it?" he said.</p>

<p>"No, I left it partly open."</p>

<p>Sholmes tried the gate; then, alarmed, he examined the lock. An
oath escaped him:</p>

<p>"Good God! it is locked! locked with a key!"</p>

<p>He shook the gate with all his strength; then, realizing the
futility of his efforts, he dropped his arms, discouraged, and
muttered, in a jerky manner:</p>

<p>"I can see it all now&mdash;it is Lupin. He foresaw that I would
leave the train at Creil, and he prepared this neat little trap for
me in case I should commence my investigation this evening.
Moreover, he was kind enough to send me a companion to share my
captivity. All done to make me lose a day, and, perhaps, also, to
teach me to mind my own business."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say we are prisoners?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. Herlock Sholmes and Wilson are the prisoners of Arsène
Lupin. It's a bad beginning; but he laughs best who laughs
last."</p>

<p>Wilson seized Sholmes' arm, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Look!...Look up there!...A light..."</p>

<p>A light shone through one of the windows of the first floor.
Both of them ran to the house, and each ascended by the stairs he
had used on coming out a short time before, and they met again at
the entrance to the lighted chamber. A small piece of a candle was
burning in the center of the room. Beside it there was a basket
containing a bottle, a roasted chicken, and a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>Sholmes was greatly amused, and laughed heartily.</p>

<p>"Wonderful! we are invited to supper. It is really an enchanted
place, a genuine fairyland. Come, Wilson, cheer up! this is not a
funeral. It's all very funny."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure it is so very funny?" asked Wilson, in a
lugubrious tone.</p>

<p>"Am I sure?" exclaimed Sholmes, with a gaiety that was too
boisterous to be natural, "why, to tell the truth, it's the
funniest thing I ever saw. It's a jolly good comedy! What a master
of sarcasm this Arsène Lupin is! He makes a fool of you with the
utmost grace and delicacy. I wouldn't miss this feast for all the
money in the Bank of England. Come, Wilson, you grieve me. You
should display that nobility of character which rises superior to
misfortune. I don't see that you have any cause for complaint,
really, I don't."</p>

<p>After a time, by dint of good humor and sarcasm, he managed to
restore Wilson to his normal mood, and make him swallow a morsel of
chicken and a glass of wine. But when the candle went out and they
prepared to spend the night there, with the bare floor for a
mattress and the hard wall for a pillow, the harsh and ridiculous
side of the situation was impressed upon them. That particular
incident will not form a pleasant page in the memoirs of the famous
detective.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>Next morning Wilson awoke, stiff and cold. A slight noise
attracted his attention: Herlock Sholmes was kneeling on the floor,
critically examining some grains of sand and studying some
chalk-marks, now almost effaced, which formed certain figures and
numbers, which figures he entered in his notebook.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Wilson, who was deeply interested in the work, he
examined each room, and found similar chalk-marks in two other
apartments. He noticed, also, two circles on the oaken panels, an
arrow on a wainscot, and four figures on four steps of the stairs.
At the end of an hour Wilson said:</p>

<p>"The figures are correct, aren't they?"</p>

<p>"I don't know; but, at all events, they mean something," replied
Sholmes, who had forgotten the discomforts of the night in the joy
created by his new discoveries.</p>

<p>"It is quite obvious," said Wilson, "they represent the number
of pieces in the floor."</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>"Yes. And the two circles indicate that the panels are false, as
you can readily ascertain, and the arrow points in the direction in
which the panels move."</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes looked at Wilson, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ah! my dear friend, how do you know all that? Your clairvoyance
makes my poor ability in that direction look quite
insignificant."</p>

<p>"Oh! it is very simple," said Wilson, inflated with pride; "I
examined those marks last night, according to your instructions,
or, rather, according to the instructions of Arsène Lupin, since he
wrote the letter you sent to me."</p>

<p>At that moment Wilson faced a greater danger than he had during
his struggle in the garden with Herlock Sholmes. The latter now
felt a furious desire to strangle him. But, dominating his
feelings, Sholmes made a grimace which was intended for a smile,
and said:</p>

<p>"Quite so, Wilson, you have done well, and your work shows
commendable progress. But, tell me, have you exercised your powers
of observation and analysis on any other points? I might profit by
your deductions."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, I went no farther."</p>

<p>"That's a pity. Your début was such a promising one. But, since
that is all, we may as well go."</p>

<p>"Go! but how can we get out?"</p>

<p>"The way all honest people go out: through the gate."</p>

<p>"But it is locked."</p>

<p>"It will be opened."</p>

<p>"By whom?"</p>

<p>"Please call the two policemen who are strolling down the
avenue."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"It is very humiliating. What will be said when it becomes known
that Herlock Sholmes and Wilson were the prisoners of Arsène
Lupin?"</p>

<p>"Of course, I understand they will roar with laughter," replied
Herlock Sholmes, in a dry voice and with frowning features, "but we
can't set up housekeeping in this place."</p>

<p>"And you will not try to find another way out?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"But the man who brought us the basket of provisions did not
cross the garden, coming or going. There is some other way out. Let
us look for it, and not bother with the police."</p>

<p>"Your argument is sound, but you forget that all the detectives
in Paris have been trying to find it for the last six months, and
that I searched the house from top to bottom while you were asleep.
Ah! my dear Wilson, we have not been accustomed to pursue such game
as Arsène Lupin. He leaves no trail behind him."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock, Herlock Sholmes and Wilson were liberated,
and conducted to the nearest police station, where the commissary,
after subjecting them to a severe examination, released them with
an affectation of goodwill that was quite exasperating.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, messieurs, that this unfortunate incident has
occurred. You will have a very poor opinion of French hospitality.
<i>Mon Dieu!</i> what a night you must have passed! Ah! that
rascally Lupin is no respecter of persons."</p>

<p>They took a carriage to their hotel. At the office Wilson asked
for the key of his room.</p>

<p>After some search the clerk replied, much astonished:</p>

<p>"But, monsieur, you have given up the room."</p>

<p>"I gave it up? When?"</p>

<p>"This morning, by the letter your friend brought here."</p>

<p>"What friend?"</p>

<p>"The gentleman who brought your letter...Ah! your card is still
attached to the letter. Here they are."</p>

<p>Wilson looked at them. Certainly, it was one of his cards, and
the letter was in his handwriting.</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" he muttered, "this is another of his tricks," and
he added, aloud: "Where is my luggage?"</p>

<p>"Your friend took it."</p>

<p>"Ah!...and you gave it to him?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; on the strength of your letter and card."</p>

<p>"Of course...of course."</p>

<p>They left the hotel and walked, slowly and thoughtfully, through
the Champs-&Egrave;lysées. The avenue was bright and cheerful
beneath a clear autumn sun; the air was mild and pleasant.</p>

<p>At Rond-Point, Herlock Sholmes lighted his pipe. Then Wilson
spoke:</p>

<p>"I can't understand you, Sholmes. You are so calm and unruffled.
They play with you as a cat plays with a mouse, and yet you do not
say a word."</p>

<p>Sholmes stopped, as he replied:</p>

<p>"Wilson, I was thinking of your card."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"The point is this: here is a man who, in view of a possible
struggle with us, procures specimens of our handwriting, and who
holds, in his possession, one or more of your cards. Now, have you
considered how much precaution and skill those facts
represent?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, Wilson, to overcome an enemy so well prepared and so
thoroughly equipped requires the infinite shrewdness of...of a
Herlock Sholmes. And yet, as you have seen, Wilson, I have lost the
first round."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At six o'clock the <i>Echo de France</i> published the following
article in its evening edition:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"This morning Mon. Thenard, commissary of
police in the sixteenth district, released Herlock Sholmes and his
friend Wilson, both of whom had been locked in the house of the
late Baron d'Hautrec, where they spent a very pleasant
night&mdash;thanks to the thoughtful care and attention of Arsène
Lupin.<br>
<br>
"In addition to their other troubles, these gentlemen have been
robbed of their valises, and, in consequence thereof, they have
entered a formal complaint against Arsène Lupin.<br>
<br>
"Arsène Lupin, satisfied that he has given them a mild reproof,
hopes these gentlemen will not force him to resort to more
stringent measures."</p>

<p>"Bah!" exclaimed Herlock Sholmes, crushing the paper in his
hands, "that is only child's play! And that is the only criticism I
have to make of Arsène Lupin: he plays to the gallery. There is
that much of the fakir in him."</p>

<p>"Ah! Sholmes, you are a wonderful man! You have such a command
over your temper. Nothing ever disturbs you."</p>

<p>"No, nothing disturbs me," replied Sholmes, in a voice that
trembled from rage; "besides, what's the use of losing my
temper?...I am quite confident of the final result; I shall have
the last word."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>Chapter 4. Light in the
Darkness</h2>

<p>However well-tempered a man's character may be&mdash;and Herlock
Sholmes is one of those men over whom ill-fortune has little or no
hold&mdash;there are circumstances wherein the most courageous
combatant feels the necessity of marshaling his forces before
risking the chances of a battle.</p>

<p>"I shall take a vacation today," said Sholmes.</p>

<p>"And what shall I do?" asked Wilson.</p>

<p>"You, Wilson&mdash;let me see! You can buy some underwear and
linen to replenish our wardrobe, while I take a rest."</p>

<p>"Very well, Sholmes, I will watch while you sleep."</p>

<p>Wilson uttered these words with all the importance of a sentinel
on guard at the outpost, and therefore exposed to the greatest
danger. His chest was expanded; his muscles were tense. Assuming a
shrewd look, he scrutinized, officially, the little room in which
they had fixed their abode.</p>

<p>"Very well, Wilson, you can watch. I shall occupy myself in the
preparation of a line of attack more appropriate to the methods of
the enemy we are called upon to meet. Do you see, Wilson, we have
been deceived in this fellow Lupin. My opinion is that we must
commence at the very beginning of this affair."</p>

<p>"And even before that, if possible. But have we sufficient
time?"</p>

<p>"Nine days, dear boy. That is five too many."</p>

<p>The Englishman spent the entire afternoon in smoking and
sleeping. He did not enter upon his new plan of attack until the
following day. Then he said:</p>

<p>"Wilson, I am ready. Let us attack the enemy."</p>

<p>"Lead on, Macduff!" exclaimed Wilson, full of martial ardor. "I
wish to fight in the front rank. Oh! have no fear. I shall do
credit to my King and country, for I am an Englishman."</p>

<p>In the first place, Sholmes had three long and important
interviews: With Monsieur Detinan, whose rooms he examined with the
greatest care and precision; with Suzanne Gerbois, whom he
questioned in regard to the blonde Lady; and with Sister Auguste,
who had retired to the convent of the Visitandines since the murder
of Baron d'Hautrec.</p>

<p>At each of these interviews Wilson had remained outside; and
each time he asked:</p>

<p>"Satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>"I was sure we were on the right track."</p>

<p>They paid a visit to the two houses adjoining that of the late
Baron d'Hautrec in the avenue Henri-Martin; then they visited the
rue Clapeyron, and, while he was examining the front of number 25,
Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"All these houses must be connected by secret passages, but I
can't find them."</p>

<p>For the first time in his life, Wilson doubted the omnipotence
of his famous associate. Why did he now talk so much and accomplish
so little?</p>

<p>"Why?" exclaimed Sholmes, in answer to Wilson's secret thought,
"because, with this fellow Lupin, a person has to work in the dark,
and, instead of deducting the truth from established facts, a man
must extract it from his own brain, and afterward learn if it is
supported by the facts in the case."</p>

<p>"But what about the secret passages?"</p>

<p>"They must exist. But even though I should discover them, and
thus learn how Arsène Lupin made his entrance to the lawyer's house
and how the blonde Lady escaped from the house of Baron d'Hautrec
after the murder, what good would it do? How would it help me?
Would it furnish me with a weapon of attack?"</p>

<p>"Let us attack him just the same," exclaimed Wilson, who had
scarcely uttered these words when he jumped back with a cry of
alarm. Something had fallen at their feet; it was a bag filled with
sand which might have caused them serious injury if it had struck
them.</p>

<p>Sholmes looked up. Some men were working on a scaffolding
attached to the balcony at the fifth floor of the house. He
said:</p>

<p>"We were lucky; one step more, and that heavy bag would have
fallen on our heads. I wonder if&mdash;"</p>

<p>Moved by a sudden impulse, he rushed into the house, up the five
flights of stairs, rang the bell, pushed his way into the apartment
to the great surprise and alarm of the servant who came to the
door, and made his way to the balcony in front of the house. But
there was no one there.</p>

<p>"Where are the workmen who were here a moment ago?" he asked the
servant.</p>

<p>"They have just gone."</p>

<p>"Which way did they go?"</p>

<p>"By the servants' stairs."</p>

<p>Sholmes leaned out of the window. He saw two men leaving the
house, carrying bicycles. They mounted them and quickly disappeared
around the corner.</p>

<p>"How long have they been working on this scaffolding?"</p>

<p>"Those men?...only since this morning. It's their first
day."</p>

<p>Sholmes returned to the street, and joined Wilson. Together they
returned to the hotel, and thus the second day ended in a mournful
silence.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *

<p>On the following day their programme was almost similar. They
sat together on a bench in the avenue Henri-Martin, much to
Wilson's disgust, who did not find it amusing to spend long hours
watching the house in which the tragedy had occurred.</p>

<p>"What do you expect, Sholmes? That Arsène Lupin will walk out of
the house?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"That the blonde Lady will make her appearance?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I am looking for something to occur; some slight incident that
will furnish me with a clue to work on."</p>

<p>"And if it does not occur?"</p>

<p>"Then I must, myself, create the spark that will set fire to the
powder."</p>

<p>A solitary incident&mdash;and that of a disagreeable
nature&mdash;broke the monotony of the forenoon.</p>

<p>A gentleman was riding along the avenue when his horse suddenly
turned aside in such a manner that it ran against the bench on
which they were sitting, and struck Sholmes a slight blow on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed Sholmes, "a little more and I would have had a
broken shoulder."</p>

<p>The gentleman struggled with his horse. The Englishman drew his
revolver and pointed it; but Wilson seized his arm, and said:</p>

<p>"Don't be foolish! What are you going to do? Kill the man?"</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, Wilson! Let go!"</p>

<p>During the brief struggle between Sholmes and Wilson the
stranger rode away.</p>

<p>"Now, you can shoot," said Wilson, triumphantly, when the
horseman was at some distance.</p>

<p>"Wilson, you're an idiot! Don't you understand that the man is
an accomplice of Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>Sholmes was trembling from rage. Wilson stammered pitifully:</p>

<p>"What!...that man...an accomplice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the same as the workmen who tried to drop the bag of sand
on us yesterday."</p>

<p>"It can't be possible!"</p>

<p>"Possible or not, there was only one way to prove it."</p>

<p>"By killing the man?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;by killing the horse. If you hadn't grabbed my arm, I
should have captured one of Lupin's accomplices. Now, do you
understand the folly of your act?"</p>

<p>Throughout the afternoon both men were morose. They did not
speak a word to each other. At five o'clock they visited the rue
Clapeyron, but were careful to keep at a safe distance from the
houses. However, three young men who were passing through the
street, arm in arm, singing, ran against Sholmes and Wilson and
refused to let them pass. Sholmes, who was in an ill humor,
contested the right of way with them. After a brief struggle,
Sholmes resorted to his fists. He struck one of the men a hard blow
on the chest, another a blow in the face, and thus subdued two of
his adversaries. Thereupon the three of them took to their heels
and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Sholmes, "that does me good. I needed a little
exercise."</p>

<p>But Wilson was leaning against the wall. Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, old chap? You're quite pale."</p>

<p>Wilson pointed to his left arm, which hung inert, and
stammered:</p>

<p>"I don't know what it is. My arm pains me."</p>

<p>"Very much?...Is it serious?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am afraid so."</p>

<p>He tried to raise his arm, but it was helpless. Sholmes felt it,
gently at first, then in a rougher way, "to see how badly it was
hurt," he said. He concluded that Wilson was really hurt, so he led
him to a neighboring pharmacy, where a closer examination revealed
the fact that the arm was broken and that Wilson was a candidate
for the hospital. In the meantime they bared his arm and applied
some remedies to ease his suffering.</p>

<p>"Come, come, old chap, cheer up!" said Sholmes, who was holding
Wilson's arm, "in five or six weeks you will be all right again.
But I will pay them back...the rascals! Especially Lupin, for this
is his work...no doubt of that. I swear to you if ever&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, dropped the arm&mdash;which caused Wilson
such an access of pain that he almost fainted&mdash;and, striking
his forehead, Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"Wilson, I have an idea. You know, I have one occasionally."</p>

<p>He stood for a moment, silent, with staring eyes, and then
muttered, in short, sharp phrases:</p>

<p>"Yes, that's it...that will explain all...right at my feet...and
I didn't see it...ah, <i>parbleu</i>! I should have thought of it
before...Wilson, I shall have good news for you."</p>

<p>Abruptly leaving his old friend, Sholmes ran into the street and
went directly to the house known as number 25. On one of the
stones, to the right of the door, he read this inscription:
"Destange, architect, 1875."</p>

<p>There was a similar inscription on the house numbered 23.</p>

<p>Of course, there was nothing unusual in that. But what might be
read on the houses in the avenue Henri-Martin?</p>

<p>A carriage was passing. He engaged it and directed the driver to
take him to No. 134 avenue Henri-Martin. He was roused to a high
pitch of excitement. He stood up in the carriage and urged the
horse to greater speed. He offered extra <i>pourboires</i> to the
driver. Quicker! Quicker!</p>

<p>How great was his anxiety as they turned from the rue de la
Pompe! Had he caught a glimpse of the truth at last?</p>

<p>On one of the stones of the late Baron's house he read the
words: "Destange, architect, 1874." And a similar inscription
appeared on the two adjoining houses.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The reaction was such that he settled down in the seat of the
carriage, trembling from joy. At last, a tiny ray of light had
penetrated the dark shadows which encompassed these mysterious
crimes! In the vast sombre forest wherein a thousand pathways
crossed and re-crossed, he had discovered the first clue to the
track followed by the enemy!</p>

<p>He entered a branch postoffice and obtained telephonic
connection with the château de Crozon. The Countess answered the
telephone call.</p>

<p>"Hello!...Is that you, madame?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sholmes, isn't it? Everything going all right?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, but I wish to ask you one question...Hello!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I hear you."</p>

<p>"Tell me, when was the château de Crozon built?"</p>

<p>"It was destroyed by fire and rebuilt about thirty years
ago."</p>

<p>"Who built it, and in what year?"</p>

<p>"There is an inscription on the front of the house which reads:
'Lucien Destange, architect, 1877.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you, madame, that is all. Goodbye."</p>

<p>He went away, murmuring: "Destange...Lucien Destange...that name
has a familiar sound."</p>

<p>He noticed a public reading-room, entered, consulted a
dictionary of modern biography, and copied the following
information: "Lucien Destange, born 1840, Grand-Prix de Rome,
officer of the Legion of Honor, author of several valuable books on
architecture, etc..."</p>

<p>Then he returned to the pharmacy and found that Wilson had been
taken to the hospital. There Sholmes found him with his arm in
splints, and shivering with fever.</p>

<p>"Victory! Victory!" cried Sholmes. "I hold one end of the
thread."</p>

<p>"Of what thread?"</p>

<p>"The one that leads to victory. I shall now be walking on solid
ground, where there will be footprints, clues..."</p>

<p>"Cigarette ashes?" asked Wilson, whose curiosity had overcome
his pain.</p>

<p>"And many other things! Just think, Wilson, I have found the
mysterious link which unites the different adventures in which the
blonde Lady played a part. Why did Lupin select those three houses
for the scenes of his exploits?"</p>

<p>"Yes, why?"</p>

<p>"Because those three houses were built by the same architect.
That was an easy problem, eh? Of course...but who would have
thought of it?"</p>

<p>"No one but you."</p>

<p>"And who, except I, knows that the same architect, by the use of
analogous plans, has rendered it possible for a person to execute
three distinct acts which, though miraculous in appearance, are, in
reality, quite simple and easy?"</p>

<p>"That was a stroke of good luck."</p>

<p>"And it was time, dear boy, as I was becoming very impatient.
You know, this is our fourth day."</p>

<p>"Out of ten."</p>

<p>"Oh! after this&mdash;"</p>

<p>Sholmes was excited, delighted, and gayer than usual.</p>

<p>"And when I think that these rascals might have attacked me in
the street and broken my arm just as they did yours! Isn't that so,
Wilson?"</p>

<p>Wilson simply shivered at the horrible thought. Sholmes
continued:</p>

<p>"We must profit by the lesson. I can see, Wilson, that we were
wrong to try and fight Lupin in the open, and leave ourselves
exposed to his attacks."</p>

<p>"I can see it, and feel it, too, in my broken arm," said
Wilson.</p>

<p>"You have one consolation, Wilson; that is, that I escaped. Now,
I must be doubly cautious. In an open fight he will defeat me; but
if I can work in the dark, unseen by him, I have the advantage, no
matter how strong his forces may be."</p>

<p>"Ganimard might be of some assistance."</p>

<p>"Never! On the day that I can truly say: Arsène Lupin is there;
I show you the quarry, and how to catch it; I shall go and see
Ganimard at one of the two addresses that he gave me&mdash;his
residence in the rue Pergolese, or at the Suisse tavern in the
Place du Châtelet. But, until that time, I shall work alone."</p>

<p>He approached the bed, placed his hand on Wilson's
shoulder&mdash;on the sore one, of course&mdash;and said to
him:</p>

<p>"Take care of yourself, old fellow. Henceforth your role will be
to keep two or three of Arsène Lupin's men busy watching here in
vain for my return to enquire about your health. It is a secret
mission for you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and I shall do my best to fulfil it conscientiously. Then
you do not expect to come here any more?"</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Sholmes.</p>

<p>"I don't know...of course...I am getting on as well as
possible. But, Herlock, do me a last service: give me a drink."</p>

<p>"A drink?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am dying of thirst; and with my fever&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To be sure&mdash;directly&mdash;"</p>

<p>He made a pretense of getting some water, perceived a package of
tobacco, lighted his pipe, and then, as if he had not heard his
friend's request, he went away, whilst Wilson uttered a mute prayer
for the inaccessible water.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>"Monsieur Destange!"</p>

<p>The servant eyed from head to foot the person to whom he had
opened the door of the house&mdash;the magnificent house that stood
at the corner of the Place Malesherbes and the rue
Montchanin&mdash;and at the sight of the man with gray hairs, badly
shaved, dressed in a shabby black coat, with a body as ill-formed
and ungracious as his face, he replied with the disdain which he
thought the occasion warranted:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Destange may or may not be at home. That depends. Has
monsieur a card?"</p>

<p>Monsieur did not have a card, but he had a letter of
introduction and, after the servant had taken the letter to Mon.
Destange, he was conducted into the presence of that gentleman who
was sitting in a large circular room or rotunda which occupied one
of the wings of the house. It was a library, and contained a
profusion of books and architectural drawings. When the stranger
entered, the architect said to him:</p>

<p>"You are Monsieur Stickmann?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"My secretary tells me that he is ill, and has sent you to
continue the general catalogue of the books which he commenced
under my direction, and, more particularly, the catalogue of German
books. Are you familiar with that kind of work?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, quite so," he replied, with a strong German
accent.</p>

<p>Under those circumstances the bargain was soon concluded, and
Mon. Destange commenced work with his new secretary.</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes had gained access to the house.</p>

<p>In order to escape the vigilance of Arsène Lupin and gain
admittance to the house occupied by Lucien Destange and his
daughter Clotilde, the famous detective had been compelled to
resort to a number of stratagems, and, under a variety of names, to
ingratiate himself into the good graces and confidence of a number
of persons&mdash;in short, to live, during forty-eight hours, a
most complicated life. During that time he had acquired the
following information: Mon. Destange, having retired from active
business on account of his failing health, now lived amongst the
many books he had accumulated on the subject of architecture. He
derived infinite pleasure in viewing and handling those dusty old
volumes.</p>

<p>His daughter Clotilde was considered eccentric. She passed her
time in another part of the house, and never went out.</p>

<p>"Of course," Sholmes said to himself, as he wrote in a register
the titles of the books which Mon. Destange dictated to him, "all
that is vague and incomplete, but it is quite a long step in
advance. I shall surely solve one of these absorbing problems: Is
Mon. Destange associated with Arsène Lupin? Does he continue to see
him? Are the papers relating to the construction of the three
houses still in existence? Will those papers not furnish me with
the location of other houses of similar construction which Arsène
Lupin and his associates will plunder in the future?</p>

<p>"Monsieur Destange, an accomplice of Arsène Lupin! That
venerable man, an officer of the Legion of Honor, working in league
with a burglar&mdash;such an idea was absurd! Besides, if we
concede that such a complicity exists, how could Mon. Destange,
thirty years ago, have possibly foreseen the thefts of Arsène
Lupin, who was then an infant?"</p>

<p>No matter! The Englishman was implacable. With his marvellous
scent, and that instinct which never fails him, he felt that he was
in the heart of some strange mystery. Ever since he first entered
the house, he had been under the influence of that impression, and
yet he could not define the grounds on which he based his
suspicions.</p>

<p>Up to the morning of the second day he had not made any
significant discovery. At two o'clock of that day he saw Clotilde
Destange for the first time; she came to the library in search of a
book. She was about thirty years of age, a brunette, slow and
silent in her movements, with features imbued with that expression
of indifference which is characteristic of people who live a
secluded life. She exchanged a few words with her father, and then
retired, without even looking at Sholmes.</p>

<p>The afternoon dragged along monotonously. At five o'clock Mon.
Destange announced his intention to go out. Sholmes was alone on
the circular gallery that was constructed about ten feet above the
floor of the rotunda. It was almost dark. He was on the point of
going out, when he heard a slight sound and, at the same time,
experienced the feeling that there was someone in the room. Several
minutes passed before he saw or heard anything more. Then he
shuddered; a shadowy form emerged from the gloom, quite close to
him, upon the balcony. It seemed incredible. How long had this
mysterious visitor been there? Whence did he come?</p>

<p>The strange man descended the steps and went directly to a large
oaken cupboard. Sholmes was a keen observer of the man's movements.
He watched him searching amongst the papers with which the cupboard
was filled. What was he looking for?</p>

<p>Then the door opened and Mlle. Destange entered, speaking to
someone who was following her:</p>

<p>"So you have decided not to go out, father?...Then I will make a
light...one second...do not move..."</p>

<p>The strange man closed the cupboard and hid in the embrasure of
a large window, drawing the curtains together. Did Mlle. Destange
not see him? Did she not hear him? Calmly she turned on the
electric lights; she and her father sat down close to each other.
She opened a book she had brought with her, and commenced to read.
After the lapse of a few minutes she said:</p>

<p>"Your secretary has gone."</p>

<p>"Yes, I don't see him."</p>

<p>"Do you like him as well as you did at first?" she asked, as if
she were not aware of the illness of the real secretary and his
replacement by Stickmann.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes."</p>

<p>Monsieur Destange's head bobbed from one side to the other. He
was asleep. The girl resumed her reading. A moment later one of the
window curtains was pushed back, and the strange man emerged and
glided along the wall toward the door, which obliged him to pass
behind Mon. Destange but in front of Clotilde, and brought him into
the light so that Herlock Sholmes obtained a good view of the man's
face. It was Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>The Englishman was delighted. His forecast was verified; he had
penetrated to the very heart of the mystery, and found Arsène Lupin
to be the moving spirit in it.</p>

<p>Clotilde had not yet displayed any knowledge of his presence,
although it was quite improbable that any movement of the intruder
had escaped her notice. Lupin had almost reached the door and, in
fact, his hand was already seeking the doorknob, when his coat
brushed against a small table and knocked something to the floor.
Monsieur Destange awoke with a start. Arsène Lupin was already
standing in front of him, hat in hand, smiling.</p>

<p>"Maxime Bermond," exclaimed Mon. Destange, joyfully. "My dear
Maxime, what lucky chance brings you here?"</p>

<p>"The wish to see you and Mademoiselle Destange."</p>

<p>"When did you return from your journey?"</p>

<p>"Yesterday."</p>

<p>"You must stay to dinner."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, I am sorry, but I have an appointment to dine
with some friends at a restaurant."</p>

<p>"Come, tomorrow, then, Clotilde, you must urge him to come
tomorrow. Ah! my dear Maxime...I thought of you many times during
your absence."</p>

<p>"Really?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I went through all my old papers in that cupboard, and
found our last statement of account."</p>

<p>"What account?"</p>

<p>"Relating to the avenue Henri-Martin."</p>

<p>"Ah! do you keep such papers? What for?"</p>

<p>Then the three of them left the room, and continued their
conversation in a small parlor which adjoined the library.</p>

<p>"Is it Lupin?" Sholmes asked himself, in a sudden access of
doubt. Certainly, from all appearances, it was he; and yet it was
also someone else who resembled Arsène Lupin in certain respects,
and who still maintained his own individuality, features, and color
of hair. Sholmes could hear Lupin's voice in the adjoining room. He
was relating some stories at which Mon. Destange laughed heartily,
and which even brought a smile to the lips of the melancholy
Clotilde. And each of those smiles appeared to be the reward which
Arsène Lupin was seeking, and which he was delighted to have
secured. His success caused him to redouble his efforts and,
insensibly, at the sound of that clear and happy voice, Clotilde's
face brightened and lost that cold and listless expression which
usually pervaded it.</p>

<p>"They love each other," thought Sholmes, "but what the deuce can
there be in common between Clotilde Destange and Maxime Bermond?
Does she know that Maxime is none other than Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>Until seven o'clock Sholmes was an anxious listener, seeking to
profit by the conversation. Then, with infinite precaution, he
descended from the gallery, crept along the side of the room to the
door in such a manner that the people in the adjoining room did not
see him.</p>

<p>When he reached the street Sholmes satisfied himself that there
was neither an automobile nor a cab waiting there; then he slowly
limped along the boulevard Malesherbes. He turned into an adjacent
street, donned the overcoat which he had carried on his arm,
altered the shape of his hat, assumed an upright carriage, and,
thus transformed, returned to a place whence he could watch the
door of Mon. Destange's house.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Arsène Lupin came out, and proceeded to walk
toward the center of Paris by way of the rues de Constantinople and
London. Herlock Sholmes followed at a distance of a hundred
paces.</p>

<p>Exciting moments for the Englishman! He sniffed the air,
eagerly, like a hound following a fresh scent. It seemed to him a
delightful thing thus to follow his adversary. It was no longer
Herlock Sholmes who was being watched, but Arsène Lupin, the
invisible Arsène Lupin. He held him, so to speak, within the grasp
of his eye, by an imperceptible bond that nothing could break. And
he was pleased to think that the quarry belonged to him.</p>

<p>But he soon observed a suspicious circumstance. In the
intervening space between him and Arsène Lupin he noticed several
people traveling in the same direction, particularly two husky
fellows in slouch hats on the left side of the street, and two
others on the right wearing caps and smoking cigarettes. Of course,
their presence in that vicinity may have been the result of chance,
but Sholmes was more astonished when he observed that the four men
stopped when Lupin entered a tobacco shop; and still more surprised
when the four men started again after Lupin emerged from the shop,
each keeping to his own side of the street.</p>

<p>"Curse it!" muttered Sholmes; "he is being followed."</p>

<p>He was annoyed at the idea that others were on the trail of
Arsène Lupin; that someone might deprive him, not of the
glory&mdash;he cared little for that&mdash;but of the immense
pleasure of capturing, single-handed, the most formidable enemy he
had ever met. And he felt that he was not mistaken; the men
presented to Sholmes' experienced eye the appearance and manner of
those who, while regulating their gait to that of another, wish to
present a careless and natural air.</p>

<p>"Is this some of Ganimard's work?" muttered Sholmes. "Is he
playing me false?"</p>

<p>He felt inclined to speak to one of the men with a view of
acting in concert with him; but as they were now approaching the
boulevard the crowd was becoming denser, and he was afraid he might
lose sight of Lupin. So he quickened his pace and turned into the
boulevard just in time to see Lupin ascending the steps of the
Hungarian restaurant at the corner of the rue du Helder. The door
of the restaurant was open, so that Sholmes, while sitting on a
bench on the other side of the boulevard, could see Lupin take a
seat at a table, luxuriously appointed and decorated with flowers,
at which three gentlemen and two ladies of elegant appearance were
already seated and who extended to Lupin a hearty greeting.</p>

<p>Sholmes now looked about for the four men and perceived them
amongst a crowd of people who were listening to a gipsy orchestra
that was playing in a neighboring café. It was a curious thing that
they were paying no attention to Arsène Lupin, but seemed to be
friendly with the people around them. One of them took a cigarette
from his pocket and approached a gentleman who wore a frock coat
and silk hat. The gentleman offered the other his cigar for a
light, and Sholmes had the impression that they talked to each
other much longer than the occasion demanded. Finally the gentleman
approached the Hungarian restaurant, entered and looked around.
When he caught sight of Lupin he advanced and spoke to him for a
moment, then took a seat at an adjoining table. Sholmes now
recognized this gentleman as the horseman who had tried to run him
down in the avenue Henri-Martin.</p>

<p>Then Sholmes understood that these men were not tracking Arsène
Lupin; they were a part of his band. They were watching over his
safety. They were his bodyguard, his satellites, his vigilant
escort. Wherever danger threatened Lupin, these confederates were
at hand to avert it, ready to defend him. The four men were
accomplices. The gentleman in the frock coat was an accomplice.
These facts furnished the Englishman with food for reflection.
Would he ever succeed in capturing that inaccessible individual?
What unlimited power was possessed by such an organization,
directed by such a chief!</p>

<p>He tore a leaf from his notebook, wrote a few lines in pencil,
which he placed in an envelope, and said to a boy about fifteen
years of age who was sitting on the bench beside him:</p>

<p>"Here, my boy; take a carriage and deliver this letter to the
cashier of the Suisse tavern, Place du Châtelet. Be quick!"</p>

<p>He gave him a five-franc piece. The boy disappeared.</p>

<p>A half hour passed away. The crowd had grown larger, and Sholmes
perceived only at intervals the accomplices of Arsène Lupin. Then
someone brushed against him and whispered in his ear:</p>

<p>"Well! what is it, Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"Ah! it is you, Ganimard?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I received your note at the tavern. What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>"He is there."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There...in the restaurant. Lean to the right...Do you see him
now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He is pouring a glass of champagne for the lady."</p>

<p>"That is not Lupin."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is."</p>

<p>"But I tell you...Ah! yet, it may be. It looks a great deal
like him," said Ganimard, naively. "And the
others&mdash;accomplices?"</p>

<p>"No; the lady sitting beside him is Lady Cliveden; the other is
the Duchess de Cleath. The gentleman sitting opposite Lupin is the
Spanish Ambassador to London."</p>

<p>Ganimard took a step forward. Sholmes retained him.</p>

<p>"Be prudent. You are alone."</p>

<p>"So is he."</p>

<p>"No, he has a number of men on the boulevard mounting guard. And
inside the restaurant that gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I, when I take Arsène Lupin by the collar and announce his
name, I shall have the entire room on my side and all the
waiters."</p>

<p>"I should prefer to have a few policemen."</p>

<p>"But, Monsieur Sholmes, we have no choice. We must catch him
when we can."</p>

<p>He was right; Sholmes knew it. It was better to take advantage
of the opportunity and make the attempt. Sholmes simply gave this
advice to Ganimard:</p>

<p>"Conceal your identity as long as possible."</p>

<p>Sholmes glided behind a newspaper kiosk, whence he could still
watch Lupin, who was leaning toward Lady Cliveden, talking and
smiling.</p>

<p>Ganimard crossed the street, hands in his pockets, as if he were
going down the boulevard, but when he reached the opposite sidewalk
he turned quickly and bounded up the steps of the restaurant. There
was a shrill whistle. Ganimard ran against the head waiter, who had
suddenly planted himself in the doorway and now pushed Ganimard
back with a show of indignation, as if he were an intruder whose
presence would bring disgrace upon the restaurant. Ganimard was
surprised. At the same moment the gentleman in the frock coat came
out. He took the part of the detective and entered into an exciting
argument with the waiter; both of them hung on to Ganimard, one
pushing him in, the other pushing him out in such a manner that,
despite all his efforts and despite his furious protestations, the
unfortunate detective soon found himself on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The struggling men were surrounded by a crowd. Two policemen,
attracted by the noise, tried to force their way through the crowd,
but encountered a mysterious resistance and could make no headway
through the opposing backs and pressing shoulders of the mob.</p>

<p>But suddenly, as if by magic, the crowd parted and the passage
to the restaurant was clear. The head waiter, recognizing his
mistake, was profuse in his apologies; the gentleman in the frock
coat ceased his efforts on behalf of the detective, the crowd
dispersed, the policemen passed on, and Ganimard hastened to the
table at which the six guests were sitting. But now there were only
five! He looked around...The only exit was the door.</p>

<p>"The person who was sitting here!" he cried to the five
astonished guests. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Destro?"</p>

<p>"No; Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>A waiter approached and said:</p>

<p>"The gentleman went upstairs."</p>

<p>Ganimard rushed up in the hope of finding him. The upper floor
of the restaurant contained private dining-rooms and had a private
stairway leading to the boulevard.</p>

<p>"No use looking for him now," muttered Ganimard. "He is far away
by this time."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>He was not far away&mdash;two hundred yards at most&mdash;in the
Madeleine-Bastille omnibus, which was rolling along very peacefully
with its three horses across the Place de l'Opéra toward the
Boulevard des Capucines. Two sturdy fellows were talking together
on the platform. On the roof of the omnibus near the stairs an old
fellow was sleeping; it was Herlock Sholmes.</p>

<p>With bobbing head, rocked by the movement of the vehicle, the
Englishman said to himself:</p>

<p>"If Wilson could see me now, how proud he would be of his
collaborator!...Bah! It was easy to foresee that the game was lost,
as soon as the man whistled; nothing could be done but watch the
exits and see that our man did not escape. Really, Lupin makes life
exciting and interesting."</p>

<p>At the terminal point Herlock Sholmes, by leaning over, saw
Arsène Lupin leaving the omnibus, and as he passed in front of the
men who formed his bodyguard Sholmes heard him say: "A
l'Etoile."</p>

<p>"A l'Etoile, exactly, a rendezvous. I shall be there," thought
Sholmes. "I will follow the two men."</p>

<p>Lupin took an automobile; but the men walked the entire
distance, followed by Sholmes. They stopped at a narrow house, No.
40 rue Chalgrin, and rang the bell. Sholmes took his position in
the shadow of a doorway, whence he could watch the house in
question. A man opened one of the windows of the ground floor and
closed the shutters. But the shutters did not reach to the top of
the window. The impost was clear.</p>

<p>At the end of ten minutes a gentleman rang at the same door and
a few minutes later another man came. A short time afterward an
automobile stopped in front of the house, bringing two passengers:
Arsène Lupin and a lady concealed beneath a large cloak and a thick
veil.</p>

<p>"The blonde Lady, no doubt," said Sholmes to himself, as the
automobile drove away.</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes now approached the house, climbed to the
window-ledge and, by standing on tiptoe, he was able to see through
the window above the shutters. What did he see?</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin, leaning against the mantel, was speaking with
considerable animation. The others were grouped around him,
listening to him attentively. Amongst them Sholmes easily
recognized the gentleman in the frock coat and he thought one of
the other men resembled the headwaiter of the restaurant. As to the
blonde Lady, she was seated in an armchair with her back to the
window.</p>

<p>"They are holding a consultation," thought Sholmes. "They are
worried over the incident at the restaurant and are holding a
council of war. Ah! what a master stroke it would be to capture all
of them at one fell stroke!"</p>

<p>One of them, having moved toward the door, Sholmes leaped to the
ground and concealed himself in the shadow. The gentleman in the
frock coat and the headwaiter left the house. A moment later a
light appeared at the windows of the first floor, but the shutters
were closed immediately and the upper part of the house was dark as
well as the lower.</p>

<p>"Lupin and the woman are on the ground floor; the two
confederates live on the upper floor," said Sholmes.</p>

<p>Sholmes remained there the greater part of the night, fearing
that if he went away Arsène Lupin might leave during his absence.
At four o'clock, seeing two policemen at the end of the street, he
approached them, explained the situation and left them to watch the
house. He went to Ganimard's residence in the rue Pergolese and
wakened him.</p>

<p>"I have him yet," said Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"If you haven't got any better hold on him than you had a while
ago, I might as well go back to bed. But we may as well go to the
station-house."</p>

<p>They went to the police station in the rue Mesnil and from there
to the residence of the commissary, Mon. Decointre. Then,
accompanied by half a dozen policemen, they went to the rue
Chalgrin.</p>

<p>"Anything new?" asked Sholmes, addressing the two policemen.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>It was just breaking day when, after taking necessary measures
to prevent escape, the commissary rang the bell and commenced to
question the concierge. The woman was greatly frightened at this
early morning invasion, and she trembled as she replied that there
were no tenants on the ground floor.</p>

<p>"What! not a tenant?" exclaimed Ganimard.</p>

<p>"No; but on the first floor there are two men named Leroux. They
have furnished the apartment on the ground floor for some country
relations."</p>

<p>"A gentleman and lady."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Who came here last night."</p>

<p>"Perhaps...but I don't know...I was asleep. But I don't think
so, for the key is here. They did not ask for it."</p>

<p>With that key the commissary opened the door of the ground-floor
apartment. It comprised only two rooms and they were empty.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" exclaimed Sholmes. "I saw both of them in this
room."</p>

<p>"I don't doubt your word," said the commissary; "but they are
not here now."</p>

<p>"Let us go to the first floor. They must be there."</p>

<p>"The first floor is occupied by two men named Leroux."</p>

<p>"We will examine the Messieurs Leroux."</p>

<p>They all ascended the stairs and the commissary rang. At the
second ring a man opened the door; he was in his shirtsleeves.
Sholmes recognized him as one of Lupin's bodyguard. The man assumed
a furious air:</p>

<p>"What do you mean by making such a row at this hour of the
morning...waking people up..."</p>

<p>But he stopped suddenly, astounded.</p>

<p>"God forgive me!...really, gentlemen, I didn't notice who it
was. Why, it is Monsieur Decointre!...and you, Monsieur Ganimard.
What can I do for you!"</p>

<p>Ganimard burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter, which
caused him to bend double and turn black in the face.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is you, Leroux," he stammered. "Oh! this is too funny!
Leroux, an accomplice of Arsène Lupin! Oh, I shall die! and your
brother, Leroux, where is he?"</p>

<p>"Edmond!" called the man. "It is Ganimard, who has come to visit
us."</p>

<p>Another man appeared and at sight of him Ganimard's mirth
redoubled.</p>

<p>"Oh! oh! we had no idea of this! Ah! my friends, you are in a
bad fix now. Who would have ever suspected it?"</p>

<p>Turning to Sholmes, Ganimard introduced the man:</p>

<p>"Victor Leroux, a detective from our office, one of the best men
in the iron brigade...Edmond Leroux, chief clerk in the
anthropometric service."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>Chapter 5. An Abduction</h2>

<p>Herlock Sholmes said nothing. To protest? To accuse the two men?
That would be useless. In the absence of evidence which he did not
possess and had no time to seek, no one would believe him.
Moreover, he was stifled with rage, but would not display his
feelings before the triumphant Ganimard. So he bowed respectfully
to the brothers Leroux, guardians of society, and retired.</p>

<p>In the vestibule he turned toward a low door which looked like
the entrance to a cellar, and picked up a small red stone; it was a
garnet. When he reached the street he turned and read on the front
of the house this inscription: "Lucien Destange, architect,
1877."</p>

<p>The adjoining house, No. 42, bore the same inscription.</p>

<p>"Always the double passage&mdash;numbers 40 and 42 have a secret
means of communication. Why didn't I think of that? I should have
remained with the two policemen."</p>

<p>He met the policemen near the corner and said to them:</p>

<p>"Two people came out of house No. 42 during my absence, didn't
they?"</p>

<p>"Yes; a gentleman and lady."</p>

<p>Ganimard approached. Sholmes took his arm, and as they walked
down the street he said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Ganimard, you have had a good laugh and will no doubt
forgive me for the trouble I have caused you."</p>

<p>"Oh! there's no harm done; but it was a good joke."</p>

<p>"I admit that; but the best jokes have only a short life, and
this one can't last much longer."</p>

<p>"I hope not."</p>

<p>"This is now the seventh day, and I can remain only three days
more. Then I must return to London."</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"I wish to ask you to be in readiness, as I may call on you at
any hour on Tuesday or Wednesday night."</p>

<p>"For an expedition of the same kind as we had tonight?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur, the very same."</p>

<p>"With what result?"</p>

<p>"The capture of Arsène Lupin," replied Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?"</p>

<p>"I swear it, on my honor, monsieur."</p>

<p>Sholmes bade Ganimard goodbye and went to the nearest hotel for
a few hours' sleep; after which, refreshed and with renewed
confidence in himself, he returned to the rue Chalgrin, slipped two
<i>louis</i> into the hand of the concierge, assured himself that
the brothers Leroux had gone out, learned that the house belonged
to a Monsieur Harmingeat, and, provided with a candle, descended to
the cellar through the low door near which he had found the garnet.
At the bottom of the stairs he found another exactly like it.</p>

<p>"I am not mistaken," he thought; "this is the means of
communication. Let me see if my skeleton-key will open the cellar
reserved for the tenant of the ground floor. Yes; it will. Now, I
will examine those cases of wine...oh! oh! here are some places
where the dust has been cleared away...and some footprints on the
ground..."</p>

<p>A slight noise caused him to listen attentively. Quickly he
pushed the door shut, blew out his candle and hid behind a pile of
empty wine cases. After a few seconds he noticed that a portion of
the wall swung on a pivot, the light of a lantern was thrown into
the cellar, an arm appeared, then a man entered.</p>

<p>He was bent over, as if he were searching for something. He felt
in the dust with his fingers and several times he threw something
into a cardboard box that he carried in his left hand. Afterward he
obliterated the traces of his footsteps, as well as the footprints
left by Lupin and the blonde lady, and he was about to leave the
cellar by the same way as he had entered, when he uttered a harsh
cry and fell to the ground. Sholmes had leaped upon him. It was the
work of a moment, and in the simplest manner in the world the man
found himself stretched on the ground, bound and handcuffed. The
Englishman leaned over him and said:</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say?...To tell what you know?"</p>

<p>The man replied by such an ironical smile that Sholmes realized
the futility of questioning him. So he contented himself by
exploring the pockets of his captive, but he found only a bunch of
keys, a handkerchief and the small cardboard box which contained a
dozen garnets similar to those which Sholmes had found.</p>

<p>Then what was he to do with the man? Wait until his friends came
to his help and deliver all of them to the police? What good would
that do? What advantage would that give him over Lupin?</p>

<p>He hesitated; but an examination of the box decided the
question. The box bore this name and address: "Leonard, jeweler,
rue de la Paix."</p>

<p>He resolved to abandon the man to his fate. He locked the cellar
and left the house. At a branch postoffice he sent a telegram to
Monsieur Destange, saying that he could not come that day. Then he
went to see the jeweler and, handing him the garnets, said:</p>

<p>"Madame sent me with these stones. She wishes to have them
reset."</p>

<p>Sholmes had struck the right key. The jeweler replied:</p>

<p>"Certainly; the lady telephoned to me. She said she would be
here today."</p>

<p>Sholmes established himself on the sidewalk to wait for the
lady, but it was five o'clock when he saw a heavily-veiled lady
approach and enter the store. Through the window he saw her place
on the counter a piece of antique jewelry set with garnets.</p>

<p>She went away almost immediately, walking quickly and passed
through streets that were unknown to the Englishman. As it was now
almost dark, he walked close behind her and followed her into a
five-story house of double flats and, therefore, occupied by
numerous tenants. At the second floor she stopped and entered. Two
minutes later the Englishman commenced to try the keys on the bunch
he had taken from the man in the rue Chalgrin. The fourth key
fitted the lock.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the darkness of the rooms, he perceived that
they were absolutely empty, as if unoccupied, and the various doors
were standing open so that he could see all the apartments. At the
end of a corridor he perceived a ray of light and, by approaching
on tiptoe and looking through the glass door, he saw the veiled
lady who had removed her hat and dress and was now wearing a velvet
dressing-gown. The discarded garments were lying on the only chair
in the room and a lighted lamp stood on the mantel.</p>

<p>Then he saw her approach the fireplace and press what appeared
to be the button of an electric bell. Immediately the panel to the
right of the fireplace moved and slowly glided behind the adjoining
panel, thus disclosing an opening large enough for a person to pass
through. The lady disappeared through this opening, taking the lamp
with her.</p>

<p>The operation was a very simple one. Sholmes adopted it and
followed the lady. He found himself in total darkness and
immediately he felt his face brushed by some soft articles. He
lighted a match and found that he was in a very small room
completely filled with cloaks and dresses suspended on hangers. He
picked his way through until he reached a door that was draped with
a portiere. He peeped through and, behold, the blonde lady was
there, under his eyes, and almost within reach of his hand.</p>

<p>She extinguished the lamp and turned on the electric lights.
Then for the first time Herlock Sholmes obtained a good look at her
face. He was amazed. The woman, whom he had overtaken after so much
trouble and after so many tricks and manoeuvres, was none other
than Clotilde Destange.</p>

<p>Clotilde Destange, the assassin of the Baron d'Hautrec and the
thief who stole the blue diamond! Clotilde Destange, the mysterious
friend of Arsène Lupin! And the blonde lady!</p>

<p>"Yes, I am only a stupid ass," thought Herlock Sholmes at that
moment. "Because Lupin's friend was a blonde and Clotilde is a
brunette, I never dreamed that they were the same person. But how
could the blonde lady remain a blonde after the murder of the baron
and the theft of the diamond?"</p>

<p>Sholmes could see a portion of the room; it was a boudoir,
furnished with the most delightful luxury and exquisite taste, and
adorned with beautiful tapestries and costly ornaments. A mahogany
couch, upholstered in silk, was located on the side of the room
opposite the door at which Sholmes was standing. Clotilde was
sitting on this couch, motionless, her face covered by her hands.
Then he perceived that she was weeping. Great tears rolled down her
pale cheeks and fell, drop by drop, on the velvet corsage. The
tears came thick and fast, as if their source were
inexhaustible.</p>

<p>A door silently opened behind her and Arsène Lupin entered. He
looked at her for a long time without making his presence known;
then he approached her, knelt at her feet, pressed her head to his
breast, folded her in his arms, and his actions indicated an
infinite measure of love and sympathy. For a time not a word was
uttered, but her tears became less abundant.</p>

<p>"I was so anxious to make you happy," he murmured.</p>

<p>"I am happy."</p>

<p>"No; you are crying...Your tears break my heart, Clotilde."</p>

<p>The caressing and sympathetic tone of his voice soothed her, and
she listened to him with an eager desire for hope and happiness.
Her features were softened by a smile, and yet how sad a smile! He
continued to speak in a tone of tender entreaty:</p>

<p>"You should not be unhappy, Clotilde; you have no cause to
be."</p>

<p>She displayed her delicate white hands and said, solemnly:</p>

<p>"Yes, Maxime; so long as I see those hands I shall be sad."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"They are stained with blood."</p>

<p>"Hush! Do not think of that!" exclaimed Lupin. "The dead is past
and gone. Do not resurrect it."</p>

<p>And he kissed the long, delicate hand, while she regarded him
with a brighter smile as if each kiss effaced a portion of that
dreadful memory.</p>

<p>"You must love me, Maxime; you must&mdash;because no woman will
ever love you as I do. For your sake, I have done many things, not
at your order or request, but in obedience to your secret desires.
I have done things at which my will and conscience revolted, but
there was some unknown power that I could not resist. What I did I
did involuntarily, mechanically, because it helped you, because you
wished it...and I am ready to do it again tomorrow...and
always."</p>

<p>"Ah, Clotilde," he said, bitterly, "why did I draw you into my
adventurous life? I should have remained the Maxime Bermond that
you loved five years ago, and not have let you know the...other man
that I am."</p>

<p>She replied in a low voice:</p>

<p>"I love the other man, also, and I have nothing to regret."</p>

<p>"Yes, you regret your past life&mdash;the free and happy life
you once enjoyed."</p>

<p>"I have no regrets when you are here," she said, passionately.
"All faults and crimes disappear when I see you. When you are away
I may suffer, and weep, and be horrified at what I have done; but
when you come it is all forgotten. Your love wipes it all away. And
I am happy again...But you must love me!"</p>

<p>"I do not love you on compulsion, Clotilde. I love you simply
because...I love you."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"I am just as sure of my own love as I am of yours. Only my life
is a very active and exciting one, and I cannot spend as much time
with you as I would like&mdash;just now."</p>

<p>"What is it? Some new danger? Tell me!"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing serious. Only..."</p>

<p>"Only what?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Well, he is on our track."</p>

<p>"Who? Herlock Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was he who dragged Ganimard into that affair at the
Hungarian restaurant. It was he who instructed the two policemen to
watch the house in the rue Chalgrin. I have proof of it. Ganimard
searched the house this morning and Sholmes was with him.
Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides? What?"</p>

<p>"Well, there is another thing. One of our men is missing."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"Jeanniot."</p>

<p>"The concierge?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why, I sent him to the rue Chalgrin this morning to pick up the
garnets that fell out of my brooch."</p>

<p>"There is no doubt, then, that Sholmes caught him."</p>

<p>"No; the garnets were delivered to the jeweler in the rue de la
Paix."</p>

<p>"Then, what has become of him?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Maxime, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"There is nothing to be afraid of, but I confess the situation
is very serious. What does he know? Where does he hide himself? His
isolation is his strong card. I cannot reach him."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"Act with extreme prudence, Clotilde. Some time ago I decided to
change my residence to a safer place, and Sholmes' appearance on
the scene has prompted me to do so at once. When a man like that is
on your track, you must be prepared for the worst. Well, I am
making my preparations. Day after tomorrow, Wednesday, I shall
move. At noon it will be finished. At two o'clock I shall leave the
place, after removing the last trace of our residence there, which
will be no small matter. Until then&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Until then we must not see each other and no one must see you,
Clotilde. Do not go out. I have no fear for myself, but I have for
you."</p>

<p>"That Englishman cannot possibly reach me."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that. He is a dangerous man. Yesterday I
came here to search the cupboard that contains all of Monsieur
Destange's old papers and records. There is danger there. There is
danger everywhere. I feel that he is watching us&mdash;that he is
drawing his net around us closer and closer. It is one of those
intuitions which never deceive me."</p>

<p>"In that case, Maxime, go, and think no more of my tears. I
shall be brave, and wait patiently until the danger is past. Adieu,
Maxime."</p>

<p>They held one another for some time in a last fond embrace. And
it was she that gently pushed him outside. Sholmes could hear the
sound of their voices in the distance.</p>

<p>Emboldened by the necessities of the situation and the urgent
need of bringing his investigation to a speedy termination, Sholmes
proceeded to make an examination of the house in which he now found
himself. He passed through Clotilde's boudoir into a corridor, at
the end of which there was a stairway leading to the lower floor;
he was about to descend this stairway when he heard voices below,
which caused him to change his route. He followed the corridor,
which was a circular one, and discovered another stairway, which he
descended and found himself amidst surroundings that bore a
familiar appearance. He passed through a door that stood partly
open and entered a large circular room. It was Monsieur Destange's
library.</p>

<p>"Ah! splendid!" he exclaimed. "Now I understand everything. The
boudoir of Mademoiselle Clotilde&mdash;the blonde
Lady&mdash;communicates with a room in the adjoining house, and
that house does not front on the Place Malesherbes, but upon an
adjacent street, the rue Montchanin, if I remember the name
correctly...And I now understand how Clotilde Destange can meet
her lover and at the same time create the impression that she never
leaves the house; and I understand also how Arsène Lupin was
enabled to make his mysterious entrance to the gallery last night.
Ah! there must be another connection between the library and the
adjoining room. One more house full of ways that are dark! And no
doubt Lucien Destange was the architect, as usual!...I should take
advantage of this opportunity to examine the contents of the
cupboard and perhaps learn the location of other houses with secret
passages constructed by Monsieur Destange."</p>

<p>Sholmes ascended to the gallery and concealed himself behind
some draperies, where he remained until late in the evening. At
last a servant came and turned off the electric lights. An hour
later the Englishman, by the light of his lantern, made his way to
the cupboard. As he had surmised, it contained the architect's old
papers, plans, specifications and books of account. It also
contained a series of registers, arranged according to date, and
Sholmes, having selected those of the most recent dates, searched
in the indexes for the name "Harmingeat." He found it in one of the
registers with a reference to page 63. Turning to that page, he
read:</p>

<p>"Harmingeat, 40 rue Chalgrin."</p>

<p>This was followed by a detailed account of the work done in and
about the installation of a furnace in the house. And in the margin
of the book someone had written these words: "See account M.
B."</p>

<p>"Ah! I thought so!" said Sholmes; "the account M. B. is the one
I want. I shall learn from it the actual residence of Monsieur
Lupin."</p>

<p>It was morning before he found that important account. It
comprised sixteen pages, one of which was a copy of the page on
which was described the work done for Mon. Harmingeat of the rue
Chalgrin. Another page described the work performed for Mon.
Vatinel as owner of the house at No. 25 rue Clapeyron. Another page
was reserved for the Baron d'Hautrec, 134 avenue Henri-Martin;
another was devoted to the Château de Crozon, and the eleven other
pages to various owners of houses in Paris.</p>

<p>Sholmes made a list of those eleven names and addresses; after
which he returned the books to their proper places, opened a
window, jumped out onto the deserted street and closed the shutters
behind him.</p>

<p>When he reached his room at the hotel he lighted his pipe with
all the solemnity with which he was wont to characterize that act,
and amidst clouds of smoke he studied the deductions that might be
drawn from the account of M. B., or rather, from the account of
Maxime Bermond alias Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock he sent the following message to Ganimard:</p>

<p class="letter">"I expect to pass through the rue Pergolese this forenoon and
will inform you of a person whose arrest is of the highest
importance. In any event, be at home tonight and tomorrow until
noon and have at least thirty men at your service."</p>

<p>Then he engaged an automobile at the stand on the boulevard,
choosing one whose chauffeur looked good-natured but dull-witted,
and instructed him to drive to the Place Malesherbes, where he
stopped him about one hundred feet from Monsieur Destange's
house.</p>

<p>"My boy, close your carriage," he said to the chauffeur; "turn
up the collar of your coat, for the wind is cold, and wait
patiently. At the end of an hour and a half, crank up your machine.
When I return we will go to the rue Pergolese."</p>

<p>As he was ascending the steps leading to the door a doubt
entered his mind. Was it not a mistake on his part to be spending
his time on the affairs of the blonde Lady, while Arsène Lupin was
preparing to move? Would he not be better engaged in trying to find
the abode of his adversary amongst the eleven houses on his
list?</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "when the blonde Lady becomes my prisoner, I
shall be master of the situation."</p>

<p>And he rang the bell.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Monsieur Destange was already in the library. They had been
working only a few minutes, when Clotilde entered, bade her father
good morning, entered the adjoining parlor and sat down to write.
From his place Sholmes could see her leaning over the table and
from time to time absorbed in deep meditation. After a short time
he picked up a book and said to Monsieur Destange:</p>

<p>"Here is a book that Mademoiselle Destange asked me to bring to
her when I found it."</p>

<p>He went into the little parlor, stood before Clotilde in such a
manner that her father could not see her, and said:</p>

<p>"I am Monsieur Stickmann, your father's new secretary."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Clotilde, without moving, "my father has changed his
secretary? I didn't know it."</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle, and I desire to speak with you."</p>

<p>"Kindly take a seat, monsieur; I have finished."</p>

<p>She added a few words to her letter, signed it, enclosed it in
the envelope, sealed it, pushed her writing material away, rang the
telephone, got in communication with her dressmaker, asked the
latter to hasten the completion of a traveling dress, as she
required it at once, and then, turning to Sholmes, she said:</p>

<p>"I am at your service, monsieur. But do you wish to speak before
my father? Would not that be better?"</p>

<p>"No, mademoiselle; and I beg of you, do not raise your voice. It
is better that Monsieur Destange should not hear us."</p>

<p>"For whose sake is it better?"</p>

<p>"Yours, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"I cannot agree to hold any conversation with you that my father
may not hear."</p>

<p>"But you must agree to this. It is imperative."</p>

<p>Both of them arose, eye to eye. She said:</p>

<p>"Speak, monsieur."</p>

<p>Still standing, he commenced:</p>

<p>"You will be so good as to pardon me if I am mistaken on certain
points of secondary importance. I will guarantee, however, the
general accuracy of my statements."</p>

<p>"Can we not dispense with these preliminaries, monsieur? Or are
they necessary?"</p>

<p>Sholmes felt the young woman was on her guard, so he
replied:</p>

<p>"Very well; I will come to the point. Five years ago your father
made the acquaintance of a certain young man called Maxime Bermond,
who was introduced as a contractor or an architect, I am not sure
which it was; but it was one or the other. Monsieur Destange took a
liking to the young man, and as the state of his health compelled
him to retire from active business, he entrusted to Monsieur
Bermond the execution of certain orders he had received from some
of his old customers and which seemed to come within the scope of
Monsieur Bermond's ability."</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes stopped. It seemed to him that the girl's pallor
had increased. Yet there was not the slightest tremor in her voice
when she said:</p>

<p>"I know nothing about the circumstances to which you refer,
monsieur, and I do not see in what way they can interest me."</p>

<p>"In this way, mademoiselle: You know, as well as I, that Maxime
Bermond is also known by the name of Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>She laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Arsène Lupin? Maxime Bermond is Arsène Lupin? Oh! no!
It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"I have the honor to inform you of that fact, and since you
refuse to understand my meaning, I will add that Arsène Lupin has
found in this house a friend&mdash;more than a friend&mdash;and
accomplice, blindly and passionately devoted to him."</p>

<p>Without emotion, or at least with so little emotion that Sholmes
was astonished at her self-control, she declared:</p>

<p>"I do not understand your object, monsieur, and I do not care
to; but I command you to say no more and leave this house."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of forcing my presence on you," replied
Sholmes, with equal sangfroid, "but I shall not leave this house
alone."</p>

<p>"And who will accompany you, monsieur?"</p>

<p>"You will."</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle, we will leave this house together, and you
will follow me without one word of protest."</p>

<p>The strange feature of the foregoing interview was the absolute
coolness of the two adversaries. It bore no resemblance to an
implacable duel between two powerful wills; but, judging solely
from their attitude and the tone of their voices, an onlooker would
have supposed their conversation to be nothing more serious than a
courteous argument over some impersonal subject.</p>

<p>Clotilde resumed her seat without deigning to reply to the last
remark of Herlock Sholmes, except by a shrug of her shoulders.
Sholmes looked at his watch and said:</p>

<p>"It is half-past ten. We will leave here in five minutes."</p>

<p>"Perhaps."</p>

<p>"If not, I shall go to Monsieur Destange, and tell
him&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The truth. I will tell him of the vicious life of Maxime
Bermond, and I will tell him of the double life of his
accomplice."</p>

<p>"Of his accomplice?"</p>

<p>"Yes, of the woman known as the blonde Lady, of the woman who
was blonde."</p>

<p>"What proofs will you give him?"</p>

<p>"I will take him to the rue Chalgrin, and show him the secret
passage made by Arsène Lupin's workmen&mdash;while doing the work
of which he had the control&mdash;between the houses numbered 40
and 42; the passage which you and he used two nights ago."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I will then take Monsieur Destange to the house of Monsieur
Detinan; we will descend the servant's stairway which was used by
you and Arsène Lupin when you escaped from Ganimard, and we will
search together the means of communication with the adjoining
house, which fronts on the Boulevard des Batignolles, and not upon
the rue Clapeyron."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I will take Monsieur Destange to the château de Crozon, and it
will be easy for him, who knows the nature of the work performed by
Arsène Lupin in the restoration of the Château, to discover the
secret passages constructed there by his workmen. It will thus be
established that those passages allowed the blonde Lady to make a
nocturnal visit to the Countess' room and take the blue diamond
from the mantel; and, two weeks later, by similar means, to enter
the room of Herr Bleichen and conceal the blue diamond in his
tooth-powder&mdash;a strange action, I confess; a woman's revenge,
perhaps; but I don't know, and I don't care."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"After that," said Herlock Sholmes, in a more serious tone, "I
will take Monsieur Destange to 134 avenue Henri-Martin, and we will
learn how the Baron d'Hautrec&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, keep quiet," stammered the girl, struck with a sudden
terror, "I forbid you!...you dare to say that it was I...you accuse
me?..."</p>

<p>"I accuse you of having killed the Baron d'Hautrec."</p>

<p>"No, no, it is a lie."</p>

<p>"You killed the Baron d'Hautrec, mademoiselle. You entered his
service under the name of Antoinette Bréhat, for the purpose of
stealing the blue diamond and you killed him."</p>

<p>"Keep quiet, monsieur," she implored him. "Since you know so
much, you must know that I did not murder the baron."</p>

<p>"I did not say that you murdered him, mademoiselle. Baron
d'Hautrec was subject to fits of insanity that only Sister Auguste
could control. She told me so herself. In her absence, he must have
attacked you, and in the course of the struggle you struck him in
order to save your own life. Frightened at your awful situation,
you rang the bell, and fled without even taking the blue diamond
from the finger of your victim. A few minutes later you returned
with one of Arsène Lupin's accomplices, who was a servant in the
adjoining house, you placed the baron on the bed, you put the room
in order, but you were afraid to take the blue diamond. Now, I have
told you what happened on that night. I repeat, you did not murder
the baron, and yet it was your hand that struck the blow."</p>

<p>She had crossed them over her forehead&mdash;those long delicate
white hands&mdash;and kept them thus for a long time. At last,
loosening her fingers, she said, in a voice rent by anguish:</p>

<p>"And do you intend to tell all that to my father?"</p>

<p>"Yes; and I will tell him that I have secured as witnesses:
Mademoiselle Gerbois, who will recognize the blonde Lady; Sister
Auguste, who will recognize Antoinette Bréhat; and the Countess de
Crozon, who will recognize Madame de Réal. That is what I shall
tell him."</p>

<p>"You will not dare," she said, recovering her self-possession in
the face of an immediate peril.</p>

<p>He arose, and made a step toward the library. Clotilde stopped
him:</p>

<p>"One moment, monsieur."</p>

<p>She paused, reflected a moment, and then, perfect mistress of
herself, said:</p>

<p>"You are Herlock Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>"What do I want? I am fighting a duel with Arsène Lupin, and I
must win. The contest is now drawing to a climax, and I have an
idea that a hostage as precious as you will give me an important
advantage over my adversary. Therefore, you will follow me,
mademoiselle; I will entrust you to one of my friends. As soon as
the duel is ended, you will be set at liberty."</p>

<p>"Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That is all. I do not belong to the police service of this
country, and, consequently, I do not consider that I am under any
obligation...to cause your arrest."</p>

<p>She appeared to have come to a decision...yet she required a
momentary respite. She closed her eyes, the better to concentrate
her thoughts. Sholmes looked at her in surprise; she was now so
tranquil and, apparently, indifferent to the dangers which
threatened her. Sholmes thought: Does she believe that she is in
danger? Probably not&mdash;since Lupin protects her. She has
confidence in him. She believes that Lupin is omnipotent, and
infallible.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "I told you that we would leave here in
five minutes. That time has almost expired."</p>

<p>"Will you permit me to go to my room, monsieur, to get some
necessary articles?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, mademoiselle; and I will wait for you in the rue
Montchanin. Jeanniot, the concierge, is a friend of mine."</p>

<p>"Ah! you know..." she said, visibly alarmed.</p>

<p>"I know many things."</p>

<p>"Very well. I will ring for the maid."</p>

<p>The maid brought her hat and jacket. Then Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"You must give Monsieur Destange some reason for our departure,
and, if possible, let your excuse serve for an absence of several
days."</p>

<p>"That shall not be necessary. I shall be back very soon."</p>

<p>They exchanged defiant glances and an ironic smile.</p>

<p>"What faith you have in him!" said Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Absolute."</p>

<p>"He does everything well, doesn't he? He succeeds in everything
he undertakes. And whatever he does receives your approval and
cooperation."</p>

<p>"I love him," she said, with a touch of passion in her
voice.</p>

<p>"And you think that he will save you?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders, and, approaching her father, she
said:</p>

<p>"I am going to deprive you of Monsieur Stickmann. We are going
to the National Library."</p>

<p>"You will return for luncheon?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps...no, I think not...but don't be uneasy."</p>

<p>Then she said to Sholmes, in a firm voice:</p>

<p>"I am at your service, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Absolutely?"</p>

<p>"Quite so."</p>

<p>"I warn you that if you attempt to escape, I shall call the
police and have you arrested. Do not forget that the blonde Lady is
on parole."</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honor that I shall not attempt to
escape."</p>

<p>"I believe you. Now, let us go."</p>

<p>They left the house together, as he had predicted.</p>

<p>The automobile was standing where Sholmes had left it. As they
approached it, Sholmes could hear the rumbling of the motor. He
opened the door, asked Clotilde to enter, and took a seat beside
her. The machine started at once, gained the exterior boulevards,
the avenue Hoche and the avenue de la Grande-Armée. Sholmes was
considering his plans. He thought:</p>

<p>"Ganimard is at home. I will leave the girl in his care. Shall I
tell him who she is? No, he would take her to prison at once, and
that would spoil everything. When I am alone, I can consult my list
of addresses taken from the 'account M. B.,' and run them down.
Tonight, or tomorrow morning at the latest, I shall go to Ganimard,
as I agreed, and deliver into his hands Arsène Lupin and all his
band."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hand, gleefully, at the thought that his duel with
Lupin was drawing to a close, and he could not see any serious
obstacle in the way of his success. And, yielding to an
irrepressible desire to give vent to his feelings&mdash;an unusual
desire on his part&mdash;he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, mademoiselle, if I am unable to conceal my
satisfaction and delight. The battle has been a difficult one, and
my success is, therefore, more enjoyable."</p>

<p>"A legitimate success, monsieur, of which you have a just right
to be proud."</p>

<p>"Thank you. But where are we going? The chauffeur must have
misunderstood my directions."</p>

<p>At that moment they were leaving Paris by the gate de Neuilly.
That was strange, as the rue Pergolese is not outside the
fortifications. Sholmes lowered the glass, and said:</p>

<p>"Chauffeur, you have made a mistake...Rue Pergolese!"</p>

<p>The man made no reply. Sholmes repeated, in a louder voice:</p>

<p>"I told you to go to the rue Pergolese."</p>

<p>Still the man did not reply.</p>

<p>"Ah! but you are deaf, my friend. Or is he doing it on purpose?
We are very much out of our way...Rue Pergolese!...Turn back at
once!...Rue Pergolese!"</p>

<p>The chauffeur made no sign of having heard the order. The
Englishman fretted with impatience. He looked at Clotilde; a
mysterious smile played upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Why do you laugh?" he said. "It is an awkward mistake, but it
won't help you."</p>

<p>"Of course not," she replied.</p>

<p>Then an idea occurred to him. He rose and made a careful
scrutiny of the chauffeur. His shoulders were not so broad; his
bearing was not so stiff and mechanical. A cold perspiration
covered his forehead and his hands clenched with sudden fear, as
his mind was seized with the conviction that the chauffeur was
Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"Well, Monsieur Sholmes, what do you think of our little
ride?"</p>

<p>"Delightful, monsieur, really delightful," replied Sholmes.</p>

<p>Never in his life had he experienced so much difficulty in
uttering a few simple words without a tremor, or without betraying
his feelings in his voice. But quickly, by a sort of reaction, a
flood of hatred and rage burst its bounds, overcame his
self-control, and, brusquely drawing his revolver, he pointed it at
Mademoiselle Destange.</p>

<p>"Lupin, stop, this minute, this second, or I fire at
mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"I advise you to aim at the cheek if you wish to hit the
temple," replied Lupin, without turning his head.</p>

<p>"Maxime, don't go so fast," said Clotilde, "the pavement is
slippery and I am very timid."</p>

<p>She was smiling; her eyes were fixed on the pavement, over which
the carriage was traveling at enormous speed.</p>

<p>"Let him stop! Let him stop!" said Sholmes to her, wild with
rage, "I warn you that I am desperate."</p>

<p>The barrel of the revolver brushed the waving locks of her hair.
She replied, calmly:</p>

<p>"Maxime is so imprudent. He is going so fast, I am really afraid
of some accident."</p>

<p>Sholmes returned the weapon to his pocket and seized the handle
of the door, as if to alight, despite the absurdity of such an act.
Clotilde said to him:</p>

<p>"Be careful, monsieur, there is an automobile behind us."</p>

<p>He leaned over. There was an automobile close behind; a large
machine of formidable aspect with its sharp prow and blood-red
body, and holding four men clad in fur coats.</p>

<p>"Ah! I am well guarded," thought Sholmes. "I may as well be
patient."</p>

<p>He folded his arms across his chest with that proud air of
submission so frequently assumed by heroes when fate has turned
against them. And while they crossed the river Seine and rushed
through Suresnes, Rueil and Chatou, motionless and resigned,
controlling his actions and his passions, he tried to explain to
his own satisfaction by what miracle Arsène Lupin had substituted
himself for the chauffeur. It was quite improbable that the
honest-looking fellow he had selected on the boulevard that morning
was an accomplice placed there in advance. And yet Arsène Lupin had
received a warning in some way, and it must have been after he,
Sholmes, had approached Clotilde in the house, because no one could
have suspected his project prior to that time. Since then, Sholmes
had not allowed Clotilde out of his sight.</p>

<p>Then an idea struck him: the telephone communication desired by
Clotilde and her conversation with the dressmaker. Now, it was all
quite clear to him. Even before he had spoken to her, simply upon
his request to speak to her as the new secretary of Monsieur
Destange, she had scented the danger, surmised the name and purpose
of the visitor, and, calmly, naturally, as if she were performing a
commonplace action of her everyday life, she had called Arsène
Lupin to her assistance by some preconcerted signal.</p>

<p>How Arsène Lupin had come and caused himself to be substituted
for the chauffeur were matters of trifling importance. That which
affected Sholmes, even to the point of appeasing his fury, was the
recollection of that incident whereby an ordinary woman, a
sweetheart it is true, mastering her nerves, controlling her
features, and subjugating the expression of her eyes, had
completely deceived the astute detective Herlock Sholmes. How
difficult to overcome an adversary who is aided by such
confederates, and who, by the mere force of his authority, inspires
in a woman so much courage and strength!</p>

<p>They crossed the Seine and climbed the hill at Saint-Germain;
but, some five hundred metres beyond that town, the automobile
slackened its speed. The other automobile advanced, and the two
stopped, side by side. There was no one else in the
neighborhood.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sholmes," said Lupin, "kindly exchange to the other
machine. Ours is really a very slow one."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said Sholmes, calmly, convinced that he had no
choice.</p>

<p>"Also, permit me to loan you a fur coat, as we will travel quite
fast and the air is cool. And accept a couple of sandwiches, as we
cannot tell when we will dine."</p>

<p>The four men alighted from the other automobile. One of them
approached, and, as he raised his goggles, Sholmes recognized in
him the gentleman in the frock coat that he had seen at the
Hungarian restaurant. Lupin said to him:</p>

<p>"You will return this machine to the chauffeur from whom I hired
it. He is waiting in the first wine-shop to the right as you go up
the rue Legendre. You will give him the balance of the thousand
francs I promised him...Ah! yes, kindly give your goggles to
Monsieur Sholmes."</p>

<p>He talked to Mlle. Destange for a moment, then took his place at
the wheel and started, with Sholmes at his side and one of his men
behind him. Lupin had not exaggerated when he said "we will travel
quite fast." From the beginning he set a breakneck pace. The
horizon rushed to meet them, as if attracted by some mysterious
force, and disappeared instantly as though swallowed up in an
abyss, into which many other things, such as trees, houses, fields
and forests, were hurled with the tumultuous fury and haste of a
torrent as it approached the cataract.</p>

<p>Sholmes and Lupin did not exchange a word. Above their heads the
leaves of the poplars made a great noise like the waves of the sea,
rhythmically arranged by the regular spacing of the trees. And the
towns swept by like spectres: Manteo, Vernon, Gaillon. From one
hill to the other, from Bon-Secours to Canteleu, Rouen, its
suburbs, its harbor, its miles of wharves, Rouen seemed like the
straggling street of a country village. And this was Duclair,
Caudebec, the country of Caux which they skimmed over in their
terrific flight, and Lillebonne, and Quillebeuf. Then, suddenly,
they found themselves on the banks of the Seine, at the extremity
of a little wharf, beside which lay a staunch seagoing yacht that
emitted great volumes of black smoke from its funnel.</p>

<p>The automobile stopped. In two hours they had traveled over
forty leagues.</p>

<p>A man, wearing a blue uniform and a goldlaced cap, came forward
and saluted. Lupin said to him:</p>

<p>"All ready, captain? Did you receive my telegram?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I got it."</p>

<p>"Is <i>The Swallow</i> ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes, monsieur."</p>

<p>"Come, Monsieur Sholmes."</p>

<p>The Englishman looked around, saw a group of people on the
terrace in front of a café, hesitated a moment, then, realizing
that before he could secure any assistance he would be seized,
carried aboard and placed in the bottom of the hold, he crossed the
gangplank and followed Lupin into the captain's cabin. It was quite
a large room, scrupulously clean, and presented a cheerful
appearance with its varnished woodwork and polished brass. Lupin
closed the door and addressed Sholmes abruptly, and almost rudely,
as he said:</p>

<p>"Well, what do you know?"</p>

<p>"Everything."</p>

<p>"Everything? Come, be precise."</p>

<p>His voice contained no longer that polite, if ironical, tone,
which he had affected when speaking to the Englishman. Now, his
voice had the imperious tone of a master accustomed to command and
accustomed to be obeyed&mdash;even by a Herlock Sholmes. They
measured each other by their looks, enemies now&mdash;open and
implacable foes. Lupin spoke again, but in a milder tone:</p>

<p>"I have grown weary of your pursuit, and do not intend to waste
any more time in avoiding the traps you lay for me. I warn you that
my treatment of you will depend on your reply. Now, what do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Everything, monsieur."</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin controlled his temper and said, in a jerky
manner:</p>

<p>"I will tell you what you know. You know that, under the name of
Maxime Bermond, I have...<i>improved</i> fifteen houses that were
originally constructed by Monsieur Destange."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of those fifteen houses, you have seen four."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have a list of the other eleven."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You made that list at Monsieur Destange's house on that night,
no doubt."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you have an idea that, amongst those eleven houses, there
is one that I have kept for the use of myself and my friends, and
you have entrusted to Ganimard the task of finding my retreat."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What does that signify?"</p>

<p>"It signifies that I choose to act alone, and do not want his
help."</p>

<p>"Then I have nothing to fear, since you are in my hands."</p>

<p>"You have nothing to fear as long as I remain in your
hands."</p>

<p>"You mean that you will not remain?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Arsène Lupin approached the Englishman and, placing his hand on
the latter's shoulder, said:</p>

<p>"Listen, monsieur; I am not in a humor to argue with you, and,
unfortunately for you, you are not in a position to choose. So let
us finish our business."</p>

<p>"Very well."</p>

<p>"You are going to give me your word of honor that you will not
try to escape from this boat until you arrive in English
waters."</p>

<p>"I give you my word of honor that I shall escape if I have an
opportunity," replied the indomitable Sholmes.</p>

<p>"But, <i>sapristi</i>! you know quite well that at a word from
me you would soon be rendered helpless. All these men will obey me
blindly. At a sign from me they would place you in
irons&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Irons can be broken."</p>

<p>"And throw you overboard ten miles from shore."</p>

<p>"I can swim."</p>

<p>"I hadn't thought of that," said Lupin, with a laugh. "Excuse
me, master...and let us finish. You will agree that I must take the
measures necessary to protect myself and my friends."</p>

<p>"Certainly; but they will be useless."</p>

<p>"And yet you do not wish me to take them."</p>

<p>"It is your duty."</p>

<p>"Very well, then."</p>

<p>Lupin opened the door and called the captain and two sailors.
The latter seized the Englishman, bound him hand and foot, and tied
him to the captain's bunk.</p>

<p>"That will do," said Lupin. "It was only on account of your
obstinacy and the unusual gravity of the situation, that I ventured
to offer you this indignity."</p>

<p>The sailors retired. Lupin said to the captain:</p>

<p>"Let one of the crew remain here to look after Monsieur Sholmes,
and you can give him as much of your own company as possible. Treat
him with all due respect and consideration. He is not a prisoner,
but a guest. What time have you, captain?"</p>

<p>"Five minutes after two."</p>

<p>Lupin consulted his watch, then looked at the clock that was
attached to the wall of the cabin.</p>

<p>"Five minutes past two is right. How long will it take you to
reach Southampton?"</p>

<p>"Nine hours, easy going."</p>

<p>"Make it eleven. You must not land there until after the
departure of the midnight boat, which reaches Havre at eight
o'clock in the morning. Do you understand, captain? Let me repeat:
As it would be very dangerous for all of us to permit Monsieur to
return to France by that boat, you must not reach Southampton
before one o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p>"I understand."</p>

<p>"Au revoir, master; next year, in this world or in the
next."</p>

<p>"Until tomorrow," replied Sholmes.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Sholmes heard the automobile going away, and
at the same time the steam puffed violently in the depths of <i>The
Swallow</i>. The boat had started for England. About three o'clock
the vessel left the mouth of the river and plunged into the open
sea. At that moment Sholmes was lying on the captain's bunk, sound
asleep.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Next morning&mdash;it being the tenth and last day of the duel
between Sholmes and Lupin&mdash;the <i>Echo de France</i> published
this interesting bit of news:</p>

<p class="newspaper">"Yesterday a judgment of ejectment was entered in the case of
Arsène Lupin against Herlock Sholmes, the English detective.
Although signed at noon, the judgment was executed the same day. At
one o'clock this morning Sholmes was landed at Southampton."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>Chapter 6. Second Arrest of Arsène
Lupin</h2>

<p>Since eight o'clock a dozen moving-vans had encumbered the rue
Crevaux between the avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne and the avenue
Bugeaud. Mon. Felix Davey was leaving the apartment in which he
lived on the fourth floor of No. 8; and Mon. Dubreuil, who had
united into a single apartment the fifth floor of the same house
and the fifth floor of the two adjoining houses, was moving on the
same day&mdash;a mere coincidence, since the gentlemen were unknown
to each other&mdash;the vast collection of furniture regarding
which so many foreign agents visited him every day.</p>

<p>A circumstance which had been noticed by some of the neighbors,
but was not spoken of until later, was this: None of the twelve
vans bore the name and address of the owner, and none of the men
accompanying them visited the neighboring wine shops. They worked
so diligently that the furniture was all out by eleven o'clock.
Nothing remained but those scraps of papers and rags that are
always left behind in the corners of the empty rooms.</p>

<p>Mon. Felix Davey, an elegant young man, dressed in the latest
fashion, carried in his hand a walking-stick, the weight of which
indicated that its owner possessed extraordinary biceps&mdash;Mon.
Felix Davey walked calmly away and took a seat on a bench in the
avenue du Bois-de-Boulogne facing the rue Pergolese. Close to him a
woman, dressed in a neat but inexpensive costume, was reading a
newspaper, whilst a child was playing with a shovel in a heap of
sand.</p>

<p>After a few minutes Felix Davey spoke to the woman, without
turning his head:</p>

<p>"Ganimard?"</p>

<p>"Went out at nine o'clock this morning."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"To police headquarters."</p>

<p>"Alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"No telegram during the night?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Do they suspect you in the house?"</p>

<p>"No; I do some little things for Madame Ganimard, and she tells
me everything her husband does. I have been with her all
morning."</p>

<p>"Very well. Until further orders come here every day at eleven
o'clock."</p>

<p>He rose and walked away in the direction of the Dauphine gate,
stopping at the Chinese pavilion, where he partook of a frugal
repast consisting of two eggs, with some fruit and vegetables. Then
he returned to the rue Crevaux and said to the concierge:</p>

<p>"I will just glance through the rooms and then give you the
keys."</p>

<p>He finished his inspection of the room that he had used as a
library; then he seized the end of a gas-pipe, which hung down the
side of the chimney. The pipe was bent and a hole made in the
elbow. To this hole he fitted a small instrument in the form of an
ear-trumpet and blew into it. A slight whistling sound came by way
of reply. Placing the trumpet to his mouth, he said:</p>

<p>"Anyone around, Dubreuil?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"May I come up?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He returned the pipe to its place, saying to himself:</p>

<p>"How progressive we are! Our century abounds with little
inventions which render life really charming and picturesque. And
so amusing!...especially when a person knows how to enjoy life as I
do."</p>

<p>He turned one of the marble mouldings of the mantel, and the
entire half of the mantel moved, and the mirror above it glided in
invisible grooves, disclosing an opening and the lower steps of a
stairs built in the very body of the chimney; all very clean and
complete&mdash;the stairs were constructed of polished metal and
the walls of white tiles. He ascended the steps, and at the fifth
floor there was the same opening in the chimney. Mon. Dubreuil was
waiting for him.</p>

<p>"Have you finished in your rooms?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Everything cleared out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And the people?"</p>

<p>"Only the three men on guard."</p>

<p>"Very well; come on."</p>

<p>They ascended to the upper floor by the same means, one after
the other, and there found three men, one of whom was looking
through the window.</p>

<p>"Anything new?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, governor."</p>

<p>"All quiet in the street?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In ten minutes I will be ready to leave. You will go also. But
in the meantime if you see the least suspicious movement in the
street, warn me."</p>

<p>"I have my finger on the alarm-bell all the time."</p>

<p>"Dubreuil, did you tell the moving men not to touch the wire of
that bell?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; it is working all right."</p>

<p>"That is all I want to know."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen then descended to the apartment of Felix Davey
and the latter, after adjusting the marble mantel, exclaimed,
joyfully:</p>

<p>"Dubreuil, I should like to see the man who is able to discover
all the ingenious devices, warning bells, networks of electric
wires and acoustic tubes, invisible passages, moving floors and
hidden stairways. A real fairyland!"</p>

<p>"What fame for Arsène Lupin!"</p>

<p>"Fame I could well dispense with. It's a pity to be compelled to
leave a place so well equipped, and commence all over again,
Dubreuil...and on a new model, of course, for it would never do to
duplicate this. Curse Herlock Sholmes!"</p>

<p>"Has he returned to Paris?"</p>

<p>"How could he? There has been only one boat come from
Southampton and it left there at midnight; only one train from
Havre, leaving there at eight o'clock this morning and due in Paris
at eleven fifteen. As he could not catch the midnight boat at
Southampton&mdash;and the instructions to the captain on that point
were explicit&mdash;he cannot reach France until this evening via
Newhaven and Dieppe."</p>

<p>"Do you think he will come back?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he never gives up. He will return to Paris; but it will be
too late. We will be far away."</p>

<p>"And Mademoiselle Destange?"</p>

<p>"I am to see her in an hour."</p>

<p>"At her house?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no; she will not return there for several days. But you,
Dubreuil, you must hurry. The loading of our goods will take a long
time and you should be there to look after them."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that we are not being watched?"</p>

<p>"By whom? I am not afraid of anyone but Sholmes."</p>

<p>Dubreuil retired. Felix Davey made a last tour of the apartment,
picked up two or three torn letters, then, noticing a piece of
chalk, he took it and, on the dark paper of the drawing-room, drew
a large frame and wrote within it the following:</p>

<p class="letter"><i>"Arsène Lupin, gentleman-burglar, lived here
for five years at the beginning of the twentieth century."</i>
</p>

<p>This little pleasantry seemed to please him very much. He looked
at it for a moment, whistling a lively air, then said to
himself:</p>

<p>"Now that I have placed myself in touch with the historians of
future generations, I can go. You must hurry, Herlock Sholmes, as I
shall leave my present abode in three minutes, and your defeat will
be an accomplished fact...Two minutes more! you are keeping me
waiting, Monsieur Sholmes...One minute more! Are you not coming?
Well, then, I proclaim your downfall and my apotheosis. And now I
make my escape. Farewell, kingdom of Arsène Lupin! I shall never
see you again. Farewell to the fifty-five rooms of the six
apartments over which I reigned! Farewell, my own royal bed
chamber!"</p>

<p>His outburst of joy was interrupted by the sharp ringing of a
bell, which stopped twice, started again and then ceased. It was
the alarm bell.</p>

<p>What was wrong? What unforeseen danger? Ganimard? No; that
wasn't possible!</p>

<p>He was on the point of returning to his library and making his
escape. But, first, he went to the window. There was no one in the
street. Was the enemy already in the house? He listened and thought
he could discern certain confused sounds. He hesitated no longer.
He ran to his library, and as he crossed the threshold he heard the
noise of a key being inserted in the lock of the vestibule
door.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" he murmured; "I have no time to lose. The house may
be surrounded. The servants' stairway&mdash;impossible!
Fortunately, there is the chimney."</p>

<p>He pushed the moulding; it did not move. He made a greater
effort&mdash;still it refused to move. At the same time he had the
impression that the door below opened and that he could hear
footsteps.</p>

<p>"Good God!" he cried; "I am lost if this cursed
mechanism&mdash;"</p>

<p>He pushed with all his strength. Nothing moved&mdash;nothing! By
some incredible accident, by some evil stroke of fortune, the
mechanism, which had worked only a few moments ago, would not work
now.</p>

<p>He was furious. The block of marble remained immovable. He
uttered frightful imprecations on the senseless stone. Was his
escape to be prevented by that stupid obstacle? He struck the
marble wildly, madly; he hammered it, he cursed it.</p>

<p>"Ah! what's the matter, Monsieur Lupin? You seem to be
displeased about something."</p>

<p>Lupin turned around. Herlock Sholmes stood before him!</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes!...Lupin gazed at him with squinting eyes as if
his sight were defective and misleading. Herlock Sholmes in Paris!
Herlock Sholmes, whom he had shipped to England only the day before
as a dangerous person, now stood before him free and
victorious!...Ah! such a thing was nothing less than a miracle; it
was contrary to all natural laws; it was the culmination of all
that is illogical and abnormal...Herlock Sholmes here&mdash;before
his face!</p>

<p>And when the Englishman spoke his words were tinged with that
keen sarcasm and mocking politeness with which his adversary had so
often lashed him. He said:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin, in the first place I have the honor to inform
you that at this time and place I blot from my memory forever all
thoughts of the miserable night that you forced me to endure in the
house of Baron d'Hautrec, of the injury done to my friend Wilson,
of my abduction in the automobile, and of the voyage I took
yesterday under your orders, bound to a very uncomfortable couch.
But the joy of this moment effaces all those bitter memories. I
forgive everything. I forget everything&mdash;I wipe out the debt.
I am paid&mdash;and royally paid."</p>

<p>Lupin made no reply. So the Englishman continued:</p>

<p>"Don't you think so yourself?"</p>

<p>He appeared to insist as if demanding an acquiescence, as a sort
of receipt in regard to the part.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, during which the Englishman felt
that he was scrutinized to the very depth of his soul, Lupin
declared:</p>

<p>"I presume, monsieur, that your conduct is based upon serious
motives?"</p>

<p>"Very serious."</p>

<p>"The fact that you have escaped from my captain and his crew is
only a secondary incident of our struggle. But the fact that you
are here before me alone&mdash;understand, alone&mdash;face to face
with Arsène Lupin, leads me to think that your revenge is as
complete as possible."</p>

<p>"As complete as possible."</p>

<p>"This house?"</p>

<p>"Surrounded."</p>

<p>"The two adjoining houses?"</p>

<p>"Surrounded."</p>

<p>"The apartment above this?"</p>

<p>"The <i>three</i> apartments on the fifth floor that were
formerly occupied by Monsieur Dubreuil are surrounded."</p>

<p>"So that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So that you are captured, Monsieur Lupin&mdash;absolutely
captured."</p>

<p>The feelings that Sholmes had experienced during his trip in the
automobile were now suffered by Lupin, the same concentrated fury,
the same revolt, and also, let us admit, the same loyalty of
submission to force of circumstances. Equally brave in victory or
defeat.</p>

<p>"Our accounts are squared, monsieur," said Lupin, frankly.</p>

<p>The Englishman was pleased with that confession. After a short
silence Lupin, now quite self-possessed, said smiling:</p>

<p>"And I am not sorry! It becomes monotonous to win all the time.
Yesterday I had only to stretch out my hand to finish you forever.
Today I belong to you. The game is yours." Lupin laughed heartily
and then continued: "At last the gallery will be entertained! Lupin
in prison! How will he get out? In prison!...What an
adventure!...Ah! Sholmes, life is just one damn thing after
another!"</p>

<p>He pressed his closed hands to his temples as if to suppress the
tumultuous joy that surged within him, and his actions indicated
that he was moved by an uncontrollable mirth. At last, when he had
recovered his self-possession, he approached the detective and
said:</p>

<p>"And now what are you waiting for?"</p>

<p>"What am I waiting for?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Ganimard is here with his men&mdash;why don't they come
in?"</p>

<p>"I asked him not to."</p>

<p>"And he consented?"</p>

<p>"I accepted his services on condition that he would be guided by
me. Besides, he thinks that Felix Davey is only an accomplice of
Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"Then I will repeat my question in another form. Why did you
come in alone?"</p>

<p>"Because I wished to speak to you alone."</p>

<p>"Ah! ah! you have something to say to me."</p>

<p>That idea seemed to please Lupin immensely. There are certain
circumstances in which words are preferable to deeds.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sholmes, I am sorry I cannot offer you an easy chair.
How would you like that broken box? Or perhaps you would prefer the
window ledge? I am sure a glass of beer would be welcome...light or
dark?...But sit down, please."</p>

<p>"Thank you; we can talk as well standing up."</p>

<p>"Very well&mdash;proceed."</p>

<p>"I will be brief. The object of my sojourn in France was not to
accomplish your arrest. If I have been led to pursue you, it was
because I saw no other way to achieve my real object."</p>

<p>"Which was?"</p>

<p>"To recover the blue diamond."</p>

<p>"The blue diamond!"</p>

<p>"Certainly; since the one found in Herr Bleichen's tooth-powder
was only an imitation."</p>

<p>"Quite right; the genuine diamond was taken by the blonde Lady.
I made an exact duplicate of it and then, as I had designs on other
jewels belonging to the Countess and as the Consul Herr Bleichen
was already under suspicion, the aforesaid blonde Lady, in order to
avert suspicion, slipped the false stone into the aforesaid
Consul's luggage."</p>

<p>"While you kept the genuine diamond?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"That diamond&mdash;I want it."</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, but it is impossible."</p>

<p>"I have promised it to the Countess de Crozon. I must have
it."</p>

<p>"How will you get it, since it is in my possession?"</p>

<p>"That is precisely the reason&mdash;because it is in your
possession."</p>

<p>"Oh! I am to give it to you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Voluntarily?"</p>

<p>"I will buy it."</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Lupin, in an access of mirth, "you are certainly
an Englishman. You treat this as a matter of business."</p>

<p>"It is a matter of business."</p>

<p>"Well! what is your offer?"</p>

<p>"The liberty of Mademoiselle Destange."</p>

<p>"Her liberty?...I didn't know she was under arrest."</p>

<p>"I will give Monsieur Ganimard the necessary information. When
deprived of your protection, she can readily be taken."</p>

<p>Lupin laughed again, and said:</p>

<p>"My dear monsieur, you are offering me something you do not
possess. Mademoiselle Destange is in a place of safety, and has
nothing to fear. You must make me another offer."</p>

<p>The Englishman hesitated, visibly embarrassed and vexed. Then,
placing his hand on the shoulder of his adversary, he said:</p>

<p>"And if I should propose to you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My liberty?"</p>

<p>"No...but I can leave the room to consult with Ganimard."</p>

<p>"And leave me alone?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah! <i>mon Dieu</i>, what good would that be? The cursed
mechanism will not work," said Lupin, at the same time savagely
pushing the moulding of the mantel. He stifled a cry of surprise;
this time fortune favored him&mdash;the block of marble moved. It
was his salvation; his hope of escape. In that event, why submit to
the conditions imposed by Sholmes? He paced up and down the room,
as if he were considering his reply. Then, in his turn, he placed
his hand on the shoulder of his adversary, and said:</p>

<p>"All things considered, Monsieur Sholmes, I prefer to do my own
business in my own way."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, I don't require anyone's assistance."</p>

<p>"When Ganimard gets his hand on you, it will be all over. You
can't escape from them."</p>

<p>"Who knows?"</p>

<p>"Come, that is foolish. Every door and window is guarded."</p>

<p>"Except one."</p>

<p>"Which?"</p>

<p>"<i>The one I will choose.</i>"</p>

<p>"Mere words! Your arrest is as good as made."</p>

<p>"Oh! no&mdash;not at all."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I shall keep the blue diamond."</p>

<p>Sholmes looked at his watch, and said:</p>

<p>"It is now ten minutes to three. At three o'clock I shall call
Ganimard."</p>

<p>"Well, then, we have ten minutes to chat. And to satisfy my
curiosity, Monsieur Sholmes, I should like to know how you procured
my address and my name of Felix Davey?"</p>

<p>Although his adversary's easy manner caused Sholmes some
anxiety, he was willing to give Lupin the desired information since
it reflected credit on his professional astuteness; so he
replied:</p>

<p>"Your address? I got it from the blonde Lady."</p>

<p>"Clotilde!"</p>

<p>"Herself. Do you remember, yesterday morning, when I wished to
take her away in the automobile, she telephoned to her
dressmaker."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well, I understood, later, that you were the dressmaker. And
last night, on the boat, by exercising my memory&mdash;and my
memory is something I have good reason to be proud of&mdash;I was
able to recollect the last two figures of your telephone
number&mdash;73. Then, as I possessed a list of the houses you had
'improved,' it was an easy matter, on my arrival in Paris at eleven
o'clock this morning, to search in the telephone directory and find
there the name and address of Felix Davey. Having obtained that
information, I asked the aid of Monsieur Ganimard."</p>

<p>"Admirable! I congratulate you. But how did you manage to catch
the eight o'clock train at Havre? How did you escape from <i>The
Swallow</i>?"</p>

<p>"I did not escape."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You ordered the captain not to reach Southampton before one
o'clock. He landed me there at midnight. I was able to catch the
twelve o'clock boat for Havre."</p>

<p>"Did the captain betray me? I can't believe it."</p>

<p>"No, he did not betray you."</p>

<p>"Well, what then?"</p>

<p>"It was his watch."</p>

<p>"His watch?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I put it ahead one hour."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"In the usual way, by turning the hands. We were sitting side by
side, talking, and I was telling him some funny stories...Why! he
never saw me do it."</p>

<p>"Bravo! a very clever trick. I shall not forget it. But the
clock that was hanging on the wall of the cabin?"</p>

<p>"Ah! the clock was a more difficult matter, as my feet were
tied, but the sailor, who guarded me during the captain's absence,
was kind enough to turn the hands for me."</p>

<p>"He? Nonsense! He wouldn't do it."</p>

<p>"Oh! but he didn't know the importance of his act. I told him I
must catch the first train for London, at any price, and...he
allowed himself to be persuaded&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By means of&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By means of a slight gift, which the excellent fellow, loyal
and true to his master, intends to send to you."</p>

<p>"What was it?"</p>

<p>"A mere trifle."</p>

<p>"But what?"</p>

<p>"The blue diamond."</p>

<p>"The blue diamond!"</p>

<p>"Yes, the false stone that you substituted for the Countess'
diamond. She gave it to me."</p>

<p>There was a sudden explosion of violent laughter. Lupin laughed
until the tears started in his eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, but it is funny! My false diamond palmed off
on my innocent sailor! And the captain's watch! And the hands of
the clock!"</p>

<p>Sholmes felt that the duel between him and Lupin was keener than
ever. His marvellous instinct warned him that, behind his
adversary's display of mirth, there was a shrewd intellect debating
the ways and means to escape. Gradually Lupin approached the
Englishman, who recoiled, and, unconsciously, slipped his hand into
his watch-pocket.</p>

<p>"It is three o'clock, Monsieur Lupin."</p>

<p>"Three o'clock, already? What a pity! We were enjoying our chat
so much."</p>

<p>"I am waiting for your answer."</p>

<p>"My answer? <i>Mon Dieu!</i> but you are particular!...And so
this is the last move in our little game&mdash;and the stake is my
liberty!"</p>

<p>"Or the blue diamond."</p>

<p>"Very well. It's your play. What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"I play the king," said Sholmes, as he fired his revolver.</p>

<p>"And I the ace," replied Lupin, as he struck at Sholmes with his
fist.</p>

<p>Sholmes had fired into the air, as a signal to Ganimard, whose
assistance he required. But Lupin's fist had caught Sholmes in the
stomach, and caused him to double up with pain. Lupin rushed to the
fireplace and set the marble slab in motion...Too late! The door
opened.</p>

<p>"Surrender, Lupin, or I fire!"</p>

<p>Ganimard, doubtless stationed closer than Lupin had thought,
Ganimard was there, with his revolver turned on Lupin. And behind
Ganimard there were twenty men, strong and ruthless fellows, who
would beat him like a dog at the least sign of resistance.</p>

<p>"Hands down! I surrender!" said Lupin, calmly; and he folded his
arms across his breast.</p>

<p>Everyone was amazed. In the room, divested of its furniture and
hangings, Arsène Lupin's words sounded like an echo..."I
surrender!"...It seemed incredible. No one would have been
astonished if he had suddenly vanished through a trap, or if a
section of the wall had rolled away and allowed him to escape. But
he surrendered!</p>

<p>Ganimard advanced, nervously, and with all the gravity that the
importance of the occasion demanded, he placed his hand on the
shoulder of his adversary, and had the infinite pleasure of
saying:</p>

<p>"I arrest you, Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"Brrr!" said Lupin, "you make me shiver, my dear Ganimard. What
a lugubrious face! One would imagine you were speaking over the
grave of a friend. For Heaven's sake, don't assume such a funereal
air."</p>

<p>"I arrest you."</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you! In the name of the law, of which he
is a well-deserving pillar, Ganimard, the celebrated Parisian
detective, arrests the wicked Arsène Lupin. An historic event, of
which you will appreciate the true importance...And it is the
second time that it has happened. Bravo, Ganimard, you are sure of
advancement in your chosen profession!"</p>

<p>And he held out his wrists for the handcuffs. Ganimard adjusted
them in a most solemn manner. The numerous policemen, despite their
customary presumption and the bitterness of their feelings toward
Lupin, conducted themselves with becoming modesty, astonished at
being permitted to gaze upon that mysterious and intangible
creature.</p>

<p>"My poor Lupin," sighed our hero, "what would your aristocratic
friends say if they should see you in this humiliating
position?"</p>

<p>He pulled his wrists apart with all his strength. The veins in
his forehead expanded. The links of the chain cut into his flesh.
The chain fell off&mdash;broken.</p>

<p>"Another, comrades, that one was useless."</p>

<p>They placed two on him this time.</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said. "You cannot be too careful."</p>

<p>Then, counting the detectives and policemen, he said:</p>

<p>"How many are you, my friends? Twenty-five? Thirty? That's too
many. I can't do anything. Ah! if there had been only fifteen!"</p>

<p>There was something fascinating about Lupin; it was the
fascination of the great actor who plays his role with spirit and
understanding, combined with assurance and ease. Sholmes regarded
him as one might regard a beautiful painting with a due
appreciation of all its perfection in coloring and technique. And
he really thought that it was an equal struggle between those
thirty men on one side, armed as they were with all the strength
and majesty of the law, and, on the other side, that solitary
individual, unarmed and handcuffed. Yes, the two sides were
well-matched.</p>

<p>"Well, master," said Lupin to the Englishman, "this is your
work. Thanks to you, Lupin is going to rot on the damp straw of a
dungeon. Confess that your conscience pricks you a little, and that
your soul is filled with remorse."</p>

<p>In spite of himself, Sholmes shrugged his shoulders, as if to
say: "It's your own fault."</p>

<p>"Never! never!" exclaimed Lupin. "Give you the blue diamond? Oh!
no, it has cost me too much trouble. I intend to keep it. On my
occasion of my first visit to you in London&mdash;which will
probably be next month&mdash;I will tell you my reasons. But will
you be in London next month? Or do you prefer Vienna? Or Saint
Petersburg?"</p>

<p>Then Lupin received a surprise. A bell commenced to ring. It was
not the alarm-bell, but the bell of the telephone which was located
between the two windows of the room and had not yet been
removed.</p>

<p>The telephone! Ah! Who could it be? Who was about to fall into
this unfortunate trap? Arsène Lupin exhibited an access of rage
against the unlucky instrument as if he would like to break it into
a thousand pieces and thus stifle the mysterious voice that was
calling for him. But it was Ganimard who took down the receiver,
and said:</p>

<p>"Hello!...Hello!...number 648.73...yes, this is it."</p>

<p>Then Sholmes stepped up, and, with an air of authority, pushed
Ganimard aside, took the receiver, and covered the transmitter with
his handkerchief in order to obscure the tone of his voice. At that
moment he glanced toward Lupin, and the look which they exchanged
indicated that the same idea had occurred to each of them, and that
they foresaw the ultimate result of that theory: it was the blonde
Lady who was telephoning. She wished to telephone to Felix Davey,
or rather to Maxime Bermond, and it was to Sholmes she was about to
speak. The Englishman said:</p>

<p>"Hello...Hello!"</p>

<p>Then, after a silence, he said:</p>

<p>"Yes, it is I, Maxime."</p>

<p>The drama had commenced and was progressing with tragic
precision. Lupin, the irrepressible and nonchalant Lupin, did not
attempt to conceal his anxiety, and he strained every nerve in a
desire to hear or, at least, to divine the purport of the
conversation. And Sholmes continued, in reply to the mysterious
voice:</p>

<p>"Hello!...Hello!...Yes, everything has been moved, and I am just
ready to leave here and meet you as we agreed...Where?...Where you
are now...Don't believe that he is here yet!..."</p>

<p>Sholmes stopped, seeking for words. It was clear that he was
trying to question the girl without betraying himself, and that he
was ignorant of her whereabouts. Moreover, Ganimard's presence
seemed to embarrass him...Ah! if some miracle would only interrupt
that cursed conversation! Lupin prayed for it with all his
strength, with all the intensity of his incited nerves! After a
momentary pause, Sholmes continued:</p>

<p>"Hello!...Hello!...Do you hear me?...I can't hear you very
well...Can scarcely make out what you say...Are you listening?
Well, I think you had better return home...No danger now...But he
is in England! I have received a telegram from Southampton
announcing his arrival."</p>

<p>The sarcasm of those words! Sholmes uttered them with an
inexpressible comfort. And he added:</p>

<p>"Very well, don't lose any time. I will meet you there."</p>

<p>He hung up the receiver.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Ganimard, can you furnish me with three men?"</p>

<p>"For the blonde Lady, eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You know who she is, and where she is?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Good! That settles Monsieur Lupin...Folenfant, take two men,
and go with Monsieur Sholmes."</p>

<p>The Englishman departed, accompanied by the three men.</p>

<p>The game was ended. The blonde Lady was, also, about to fall
into the hands of the Englishman. Thanks to his commendable
persistence and to a combination of fortuitous circumstances, the
battle had resulted in a victory for the detective, and in
irreparable disaster for Lupin.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sholmes!"</p>

<p>The Englishman stopped.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin?"</p>

<p>Lupin was clearly shattered by this final blow. His forehead was
marked by deep wrinkles. He was sullen and dejected. However, he
pulled himself together, and, notwithstanding his defeat, he
exclaimed, in a cheerful tone:</p>

<p>"You will concede that fate has been against me. A few minutes
ago, it prevented my escape through that chimney, and delivered me
into your hands. Now, by means of the telephone, it presents you
with the blonde Lady. I submit to its decrees."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I am ready to reopen our negotiation."</p>

<p>Sholmes took Ganimard aside and asked, in a manner that did not
permit a reply, the authority to exchange a few words with the
prisoner. Then he approached Lupin, and said, in a sharp, nervous
tone:</p>

<p>"What do you want?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Destange's liberty."</p>

<p>"You know the price."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you accept?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I accept your terms."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Englishman, in surprise, "but...you refused...for
yourself&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can look out for myself, Monsieur Sholmes, but now the
question concerns a young woman...and a woman I love. In France,
understand, we have very decided ideas about such things. And Lupin
has the same feelings as other people."</p>

<p>He spoke with simplicity and candor. Sholmes replied by an
almost imperceptible inclination of his head, and murmured:</p>

<p>"Very well, the blue diamond."</p>

<p>"Take my cane, there, at the end of the mantel. Press on the
head of the cane with one hand, and, with the other, turn the iron
ferrule at the bottom."</p>

<p>Holmes took the cane and followed the directions. As he did so,
the head of the cane divided and disclosed a cavity which contained
a small ball of wax which, in turn, enclosed a diamond. He examined
it. It was the blue diamond.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin, Mademoiselle Destange is free."</p>

<p>"Is her future safety assured? Has she nothing to fear from
you?"</p>

<p>"Neither from me, nor anyone else."</p>

<p>"How can you manage it?"</p>

<p>"Quite easily. I have forgotten her name and address."</p>

<p>"Thank you. And au revoir&mdash;for I will see you again,
sometime, Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it."</p>

<p>Then followed an animated conversation between Sholmes and
Ganimard, which was abruptly terminated by the Englishman, who
said:</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, Monsieur Ganimard, that we cannot agree on
that point, but I have no time to waste trying to convince you. I
leave for England within an hour."</p>

<p>"But...the blonde Lady?"</p>

<p>"I do not know such a person."</p>

<p>"And yet, a moment ago&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You must take the affair as it stands. I have delivered Arsène
Lupin into your hands. Here is the blue diamond, which you will
have the pleasure of returning to the Countess de Crozon. What more
do you want?"</p>

<p>"The blonde Lady."</p>

<p>"Find her."</p>

<p>Sholmes pulled his cap down over his forehead and walked rapidly
away, like a man who is accustomed to go as soon as his business is
finished.</p>

<p>"Bon voyage, monsieur," cried Lupin, "and, believe me, I shall
never forget the friendly way in which our little business affairs
have been arranged. My regards to Monsieur Wilson."</p>

<p>Not receiving any reply, Lupin added, sneeringly:</p>

<p>"That is what is called 'taking British leave.' Ah! their
insular dignity lacks the flower of courtesy by which we are
distinguished. Consider for a moment, Ganimard, what a charming
exit a Frenchman would have made under similar circumstances! With
what exquisite courtesy he would have masked his triumph!...But,
God bless me, Ganimard, what are you doing? Making a search? Come,
what's the use? There is nothing left&mdash;not even a scrap of
paper. I assure you my archives are in a safe place."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that," replied Ganimard. "I must search
everything."</p>

<p>Lupin submitted to the operation. Held by two detectives and
surrounded by the others, he patiently endured the proceedings for
twenty minutes, then he said:</p>

<p>"Hurry up, Ganimard, and finish!"</p>

<p>"You are in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Of course I am. An important appointment."</p>

<p>"At the police station?"</p>

<p>"No; in the city."</p>

<p>"Ah! at what time?"</p>

<p>"Two o'clock."</p>

<p>"It is three o'clock now."</p>

<p>"Just so; I will be late. And punctuality is one of my
virtues."</p>

<p>"Well, give me five minutes."</p>

<p>"Not a second more," said Lupin.</p>

<p>"I am doing my best to expedite&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh! don't talk so much...Still searching that cupboard? It is
empty."</p>

<p>"Here are some letters."</p>

<p>"Old invoices, I presume!"</p>

<p>"No; a packet tied with a ribbon."</p>

<p>"A red ribbon? Oh! Ganimard, for God's sake, don't untie
it!"</p>

<p>"From a woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"A woman of the world?"</p>

<p>"The best in the world."</p>

<p>"Her name?"</p>

<p>"Madame Ganimard."</p>

<p>"Very funny! very funny!" exclaimed the detective.</p>

<p>At that moment the men, who had been sent to search the other
rooms, returned and announced their failure to find anything. Lupin
laughed and said:</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> Did you expect to find my visiting list, or
evidence of my business relations with the Emperor of Germany? But
I can tell you what you should investigate, Ganimard: All the
little mysteries of this apartment. For instance, that gas-pipe is
a speaking tube. That chimney contains a stairway. That wall is
hollow. And the marvellous system of bells! Ah! Ganimard, just
press that button!"</p>

<p>Ganimard obeyed.</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything?" asked Lupin.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Neither did I. And yet you notified my aeronaut to prepare the
dirigible balloon which will soon carry us into the clouds."</p>

<p>"Come!" said Ganimard, who had completed his search; "we've had
enough nonsense&mdash;let's be off."</p>

<p>He started away, followed by his men. Lupin did not move. His
guardians pushed him in vain.</p>

<p>"Well," said Ganimard, "do you refuse to go?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. But it depends."</p>

<p>"On what?"</p>

<p>"Where you want to take me."</p>

<p>"To the station-house, of course."</p>

<p>"Then I refuse to go. I have no business there."</p>

<p>"Are you crazy?"</p>

<p>"Did I not tell you that I had an important appointment?"</p>

<p>"Lupin!"</p>

<p>"Why, Ganimard, I have an appointment with the blonde Lady, and
do you suppose I would be so discourteous as to cause her a
moment's anxiety? That would be very ungentlemanly."</p>

<p>"Listen, Lupin," said the detective, who was becoming annoyed by
this persiflage; "I have been very patient with you, but I will
endure no more. Follow me."</p>

<p>"Impossible; I have an appointment and I shall keep it."</p>

<p>"For the last time&mdash;follow me!"</p>

<p>"Im-pos-sible!"</p>

<p>At a sign from Ganimard two men seized Lupin by the arms; but
they released him at once, uttering cries of pain. Lupin had thrust
two long needles into them. The other men now rushed at Lupin with
cries of rage and hatred, eager to avenge their comrades and to
avenge themselves for the many affronts he had heaped upon them;
and now they struck and beat him to their heart's desire. A violent
blow on the temple felled Lupin to the floor.</p>

<p>"If you hurt him you will answer to me," growled Ganimard, in a
rage.</p>

<p>He leaned over Lupin to ascertain his condition. Then, learning
that he was breathing freely, Ganimard ordered his men to carry the
prisoner by the head and feet, while he himself supported the
body.</p>

<p>"Go gently, now!...Don't jolt him. Ah! the brutes would have
killed him...Well, Lupin, how goes it?"</p>

<p>"None too well, Ganimard...you let them knock me out."</p>

<p>"It was your own fault; you were so obstinate," replied
Ganimard. "But I hope they didn't hurt you."</p>

<p>They had left the apartment and were now on the landing. Lupin
groaned and stammered:</p>

<p>"Ganimard...the elevator...they are breaking my bones."</p>

<p>"A good idea, an excellent idea," replied Ganimard. "Besides,
the stairway is too narrow."</p>

<p>He summoned the elevator. They placed Lupin on the seat with the
greatest care. Ganimard took his place beside him and said to his
men:</p>

<p>"Go down the stairs and wait for me below. Understand?"</p>

<p>Ganimard closed the door of the elevator. Suddenly the elevator
shot upward like a balloon released from its cable. Lupin burst
into a fit of sardonic laughter.</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried Ganimard, as he made a frantic search in the
dark for the button of descent. Having found it, he cried:</p>

<p>"The fifth floor! Watch the door of the fifth floor."</p>

<p>His assistants clambered up the stairs, two and three steps at a
time. But this strange circumstance happened: The elevator seemed
to break through the ceiling of the last floor, disappeared from
the sight of Ganimard's assistants, suddenly made its appearance on
the upper floor&mdash;the servants' floor&mdash;and stopped. Three
men were there waiting for it. They opened the door. Two of them
seized Ganimard, who, astonished at the sudden attack, scarcely
made any defence. The other man carried off Lupin.</p>

<p>"I warned you, Ganimard...about the dirigible balloon. Another
time, don't be so tenderhearted. And, moreover, remember that
Arsène Lupin doesn't allow himself to be struck and knocked down
without sufficient reason. Adieu."</p>

<p>The door of the elevator was already closed on Ganimard, and the
machine began to descend; and it all happened so quickly that the
old detective reached the ground floor as soon as his assistants.
Without exchanging a word they crossed the court and ascended the
servants' stairway, which was the only way to reach the servants'
floor through which the escape had been made.</p>

<p>A long corridor with several turns and bordered with little
numbered rooms led to a door that was not locked. On the other side
of this door and, therefore, in another house there was another
corridor with similar turns and similar rooms, and at the end of it
a servants' stairway. Ganimard descended it, crossed a court and a
vestibule and found himself in the rue Picot. Then he understood
the situation: the two houses, built the entire depth of the lots,
touched at the rear, while the fronts of the houses faced upon two
streets that ran parallel to each other at a distance of more than
sixty metres apart.</p>

<p>He found the concierge and, showing his card, enquired:</p>

<p>"Did four men pass here just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes; the two servants from the fourth and fifth floors, with
two friends."</p>

<p>"Who lives on the fourth and fifth floors?"</p>

<p>"Two men named Fauvel and their cousins, whose name is Provost.
They moved today, leaving the two servants, who went away just
now."</p>

<p>"Ah!" thought Ganimard; "what a grand opportunity we have
missed! The entire band lived in these houses."</p>

<p>And he sank down on a chair in despair.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Forty minutes later two gentlemen were driven up to the station
of the Northern Railway and hurried to the Calais express, followed
by a porter who carried their valises. One of them had his arm in a
sling, and the pallor of his face denoted some illness. The other
man was in a jovial mood.</p>

<p>"We must hurry, Wilson, or we will miss the train...Ah! Wilson,
I shall never forget these ten days."</p>

<p>"Neither will I."</p>

<p>"Ah! it was a great struggle!"</p>

<p>"Superb!"</p>

<p>"A few repulses, here and there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of no consequence."</p>

<p>"And, at last, victory all along the line. Lupin arrested! The
blue diamond recovered!"</p>

<p>"My arm broken!"</p>

<p>"What does a broken arm count for in such a victory as
that?"</p>

<p>"Especially when it is my arm."</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, don't you remember, Wilson, that it was at the very
time you were in the pharmacy, suffering like a hero, that I
discovered the clue to the whole mystery?"</p>

<p>"How lucky!"</p>

<p>The doors of the carriages were being closed.</p>

<p>"All aboard. Hurry up, gentlemen!"</p>

<p>The porter climbed into an empty compartment and placed their
valises in the rack, whilst Sholmes assisted the unfortunate
Wilson.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Wilson? You're not done up, are you? Come,
pull your nerves together."</p>

<p>"My nerves are all right."</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, then?"</p>

<p>"I have only one hand."</p>

<p>"What of it?" exclaimed Sholmes, cheerfully. "You are not the
only one who has had a broken arm. Cheer up!"</p>

<p>Sholmes handed the porter a piece of fifty centimes.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Monsieur Sholmes," said the porter.</p>

<p>The Englishman looked at him; it was Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"You!...you!" he stammered, absolutely astounded.</p>

<p>And Wilson brandished his sound arm in the manner of a man who
demonstrates a fact as he said:</p>

<p>"You! you! but you were arrested! Sholmes told me so. When he
left you Ganimard and thirty men had you in charge."</p>

<p>Lupin folded his arms and said, with an air of indignation:</p>

<p>"Did you suppose I would let you go away without bidding you
adieu? After the very friendly relations that have always existed
between us! That would be discourteous and ungrateful on my
part."</p>

<p>The train whistled. Lupin continued:</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, but have you everything you need? Tobacco
and matches...yes...and the evening papers? You will find in them
an account of my arrest&mdash;your last exploit, Monsieur Sholmes.
And now, au revoir. Am delighted to have made your acquaintance.
And if ever I can be of any service to you, I shall be only too
happy..." He leaped to the platform and closed the door.</p>

<p>"Adieu," he repeated, waving his handkerchief. "Adieu...I shall
write to you...You will write also, eh? And your arm broken,
Wilson...I am truly sorry...I shall expect to hear from both of
you. A postal card, now and then, simply address: Lupin, Paris.
That is sufficient...Adieu...See you soon."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>Chapter 7. The Jewish Lamp</h2>

<p>Herlock Sholmes and Wilson were sitting in front of the
fireplace, in comfortable armchairs, with the feet extended toward
the grateful warmth of a glowing coke fire.</p>

<p>Sholmes' pipe, a short brier with a silver band, had gone out.
He knocked out the ashes, filled it, lighted it, pulled the skirts
of his dressing-gown over his knees, and drew from his pipe great
puffs of smoke, which ascended toward the ceiling in scores of
shadow rings.</p>

<p>Wilson gazed at him, as a dog lying curled up on a rug before
the fire might look at his master, with great round eyes which have
no hope other than to obey the least gesture of his owner. Was the
master going to break the silence? Would he reveal to Wilson the
subject of his reverie and admit his satellite into the charmed
realm of his thoughts?</p>

<p>When Sholmes had maintained his silent attitude for some time,
Wilson ventured to speak:</p>

<p>"Everything seems quiet now. Not the shadow of a case to occupy
our leisure moments."</p>

<p>Sholmes did not reply, but the rings of smoke emitted by Sholmes
were better formed, and Wilson observed that his companion drew
considerable pleasure from that trifling fact&mdash;an indication
that the great man was not absorbed in any serious meditation.
Wilson, discouraged, arose and went to the window.</p>

<p>The lonely street extended between the gloomy façades of grimy
houses, unusually gloomy this morning by reason of a heavy downfall
of rain. A cab passed; then another. Wilson made an entry of their
numbers in his memorandum-book. One never knows!</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "the postman."</p>

<p>The man entered, shown in by the servant.</p>

<p>"Two registered letters, sir...if you will sign, please?"</p>

<p>Sholmes signed the receipts, accompanied the man to the door,
and was opening one of the letters as he returned.</p>

<p>"It seems to please you," remarked Wilson, after a moment's
silence.</p>

<p>"This letter contains a very interesting proposition. You are
anxious for a case&mdash;here's one. Read&mdash;"</p>

<p>Wilson read:</p>

<p class="letter">Monsieur,<br>
<br>
I desire the benefit of your services and experience. I have been
the victim of a serious theft, and the investigation has as yet
been unsuccessful. I am sending to you by this mail a number of
newspapers which will inform you of the affair, and if you will
undertake the case, I will place my house at your disposal and ask
you to fill in the enclosed check, signed by me, for whatever sum
you require for your expenses.<br>
<br>
Kindly reply by telegraph, and much oblige,<br>
<br>
Your humble servant,<br>
Baron Victor d'Imblevalle,<br>
18 rue Murillo, Paris.</p>

<p>"Ah!" exclaimed Sholmes, "that sounds good...a little trip to
Paris...and why not, Wilson? Since my famous duel with Arsène
Lupin, I have not had an excuse to go there. I should be pleased to
visit the capital of the world under less strenuous
conditions."</p>

<p>He tore the check into four pieces and, while Wilson, whose arm
had not yet regained its former strength, uttered bitter words
against Paris and the Parisians, Sholmes opened the second
envelope. Immediately, he made a gesture of annoyance, and a
wrinkle appeared on his forehead during the reading of the letter;
then, crushing the paper into a ball, he threw it, angrily, on the
floor.</p>

<p>"Well! What's the matter?" asked Wilson, anxiously.</p>

<p>He picked up the ball of paper, unfolded it, and read, with
increasing amazement:</p>

<p class="letter">My Dear Monsieur:<br>
<br>
You know full well the admiration I have for you and the interest I
take in your renown. Well, believe me, when I warn you to have
nothing whatever to do with the case on which you have just now
been called to Paris. Your intervention will cause much harm; your
efforts will produce a most lamentable result; and you will be
obliged to make a public confession of your defeat.<br>
<br>
Having a sincere desire to spare you such humiliation, I implore
you, in the name of the friendship that unites us, to remain
peacefully reposing at your own fireside.<br>
<br>
My best wishes to Monsieur Wilson, and, for yourself, the sincere
regards of your devoted<br>
Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin!" repeated Wilson, astounded.</p>

<p>Sholmes struck the table with his fist, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Ah! he is pestering me already, the fool! He laughs at me as if
I were a schoolboy! The public confession of my defeat! Didn't I
force him to disgorge the blue diamond?"</p>

<p>"I tell you&mdash;he's afraid," suggested Wilson.</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Arsène Lupin is not afraid, and this taunting letter
proves it."</p>

<p>"But how did he know that the Baron d'Imblevalle had written to
you?"</p>

<p>"What do I know about it? You do ask some stupid questions, my
boy."</p>

<p>"I thought...I supposed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? That I am a clairvoyant? Or a sorcerer?"</p>

<p>"No, but I have seen you do some marvellous things."</p>

<p>"No person can perform marvellous things. I no more than you. I
reflect, I deduct, I conclude&mdash;that is all; but I do not
divine. Only fools divine."</p>

<p>Wilson assumed the attitude of a whipped cur, and resolved not
to make a fool of himself by trying to divine why Sholmes paced the
room with quick, nervous strides. But when Sholmes rang for the
servant and ordered his valise, Wilson thought that he was in
possession of a material fact which gave him the right to reflect,
deduct and conclude that his associate was about to take a journey.
The same mental operation permitted him to assert, with almost
mathematical exactness:</p>

<p>"Sholmes, you are going to Paris."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"And Lupin's affront impels you to go, rather than the desire to
assist the Baron d'Imblevalle."</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"Sholmes, I shall go with you."</p>

<p>"Ah; ah! my old friend," exclaimed Sholmes, interrupting his
walking, "you are not afraid that your right arm will meet the same
fate as your left?"</p>

<p>"What can happen to me? You will be there."</p>

<p>"That's the way to talk, Wilson. We will show that clever
Frenchman that he made a mistake when he threw his glove in our
faces. Be quick, Wilson, we must catch the first train."</p>

<p>"Without waiting for the papers the baron has sent you?"</p>

<p>"What good are they?"</p>

<p>"I will send a telegram."</p>

<p>"No; if you do that, Arsène Lupin will know of my arrival. I
wish to avoid that. This time, Wilson, we must fight under
cover."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That afternoon, the two friends embarked at Dover. The passage
was a delightful one. In the train from Calais to Paris, Sholmes
had three hours sound sleep, while Wilson guarded the door of the
compartment.</p>

<p>Sholmes awoke in good spirits. He was delighted at the idea of
another duel with Arsène Lupin, and he rubbed his hands with the
satisfied air of a man who looks forward to a pleasant
vacation.</p>

<p>"At last!" exclaimed Wilson, "we are getting to work again."</p>

<p>And he rubbed his hands with the same satisfied air.</p>

<p>At the station, Sholmes took the wraps and, followed by Wilson,
who carried the valises, he gave up his tickets and started off
briskly.</p>

<p>"Fine weather, Wilson...Blue sky and sunshine! Paris is giving
us a royal reception."</p>

<p>"Yes, but what a crowd!"</p>

<p>"So much the better, Wilson, we will pass unnoticed. No one will
recognize us in such a crowd."</p>

<p>"Is this Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>He stopped, somewhat puzzled. Who the deuce could thus address
him by his name? A woman stood beside him; a young girl whose
simple dress outlined her slender form and whose pretty face had a
sad and anxious expression. She repeated her enquiry:</p>

<p>"You are Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>As he still remained silent, as much from confusion as from a
habit of prudence, the girl asked a third time:</p>

<p>"Have I the honor of addressing Monsieur Sholmes?"</p>

<p>"What do you want?" he replied, testily, considering the
incident a suspicious one.</p>

<p>"You must listen to me, Monsieur Sholmes, as it is a serious
matter. I know that you are going to the rue Murillo."</p>

<p>"What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I know...I know...rue Murillo...number 18. Well, you must not
go...no, you must not. I assure you that you will regret it. Do not
think that I have any interest in the matter. I do it because it is
right...because my conscience tells me to do it."</p>

<p>Sholmes tried to get away, but she persisted:</p>

<p>"Oh! I beg of you, don't neglect my advice...Ah! if I only knew
how to convince you! Look at me! Look into my eyes! They are
sincere...they speak the truth."</p>

<p>She gazed at Sholmes, fearlessly but innocently, with those
beautiful eyes, serious and clear, in which her very soul seemed to
be reflected.</p>

<p>Wilson nodded his head, as he said:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle looks honest."</p>

<p>"Yes," she implored, "and you must have confidence&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I have confidence in you, mademoiselle," replied Wilson.</p>

<p>"Oh, how happy you make me! And so has your friend? I feel
it...I am sure of it! What happiness! Everything will be all right
now!...What a good idea of mine!...Ah! yes, there is a train for
Calais in twenty minutes. You will take it...Quick, follow
me...you must come this way...there is just time."</p>

<p>She tried to drag them along. Sholmes seized her arm, and in as
gentle a voice as he could assume, said to her:</p>

<p>"Excuse me, mademoiselle, if I cannot yield to your wishes, but
I never abandon a task that I have once undertaken."</p>

<p>"I beseech you...I implore you...Ah if you could only
understand!"</p>

<p>Sholmes passed outside and walked away at a quick pace. Wilson
said to the girl:</p>

<p>"Have no fear...he will be in at the finish. He never failed
yet."</p>

<p>And he ran to overtake Sholmes.</p>

<p class="cpb">HERLOCK SHOLMES&mdash;ARS&Egrave;NE LUPIN.</p>

<p>These words, in great black letters, met their gaze as soon as
they left the railway station. A number of sandwich-men were
parading through the street, one behind the other, carrying heavy
canes with iron ferrules with which they struck the pavement in
harmony, and, on their backs, they carried large posters, on which
one could read the following notice:</p>

<p class="poem">The Match Between Herlock Sholmes and Arsène Lupin.
Arrival of the English Champion. The Great Detective Attacks the
Mystery of the rue Murillo. Read the Details in the "Echo de
France".</p>

<p>Wilson shook his head, and said:</p>

<p>"Look at that, Sholmes, and we thought we were traveling
incognito! I shouldn't be surprised to find the republican guard
waiting for us at the rue Murillo to give us an official reception
with toasts and champagne."</p>

<p>"Wilson, when you get funny, you get beastly funny," growled
Sholmes.</p>

<p>Then he approached one of the sandwich-men with the obvious
intention of seizing him in his powerful grip and crushing him,
together with his infernal signboard. There was quite a crowd
gathered about the men, reading the notices, and joking and
laughing.</p>

<p>Repressing a furious access of rage, Sholmes said to the
man:</p>

<p>"When did they hire you?"</p>

<p>"This morning."</p>

<p>"How long have you been parading?"</p>

<p>"About an hour."</p>

<p>"But the boards were ready before that?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, they were ready when we went to the agency this
morning."</p>

<p>So then it appears that Arsène Lupin had foreseen that he,
Sholmes, would accept the challenge. More than that, the letter
written by Lupin showed that he was eager for the fray and that he
was prepared to measure swords once more with his formidable rival.
Why? What motive could Arsène Lupin have in renewing the
struggle?</p>

<p>Sholmes hesitated for a moment. Lupin must be very confident of
his success to show so much insolence in advance; and was not he,
Sholmes, falling into a trap by rushing into the battle at the
first call for help?</p>

<p>However, he called a carriage.</p>

<p>"Come, Wilson!...Driver, 18 rue Murillo!" he exclaimed, with an
outburst of his accustomed energy. With distended veins and
clenched fists, as if he were about to engage in a boxing bout, he
jumped into the carriage.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The rue Murillo is bordered with magnificent private residences,
the rear of which overlook the Parc Monceau. One of the most
pretentious of these houses is number 18, owned and occupied by the
Baron d'Imblevalle and furnished in a luxurious manner consistent
with the owner's taste and wealth. There was a courtyard in front
of the house, and, in the rear, a garden well filled with trees
whose branches mingle with those of the park.</p>

<p>After ringing the bell, the two Englishmen were admitted,
crossed the courtyard, and were received at the door by a footman
who showed them into a small parlor facing the garden in the rear
of the house. They sat down and, glancing about, made a rapid
inspection of the many valuable objects with which the room was
filled.</p>

<p>"Everything very choice," murmured Wilson, "and in the best of
taste. It is a safe deduction to make that those who had the
leisure to collect these articles must now be at least fifty years
of age."</p>

<p>The door opened, and the Baron d'Imblevalle entered, followed by
his wife. Contrary to the deduction made by Wilson, they were both
quite young, of elegant appearance, and vivacious in speech and
action. They were profuse in their expressions of gratitude.</p>

<p>"So kind of you to come! Sorry to have caused you so much
trouble! The theft now seems of little consequence, since it has
procured us this pleasure."</p>

<p>"How charming these French people are!" thought Wilson, evolving
one of his commonplace deductions.</p>

<p>"But time is money," exclaimed the baron, "especially your time,
Monsieur Sholmes. So I will come to the point. Now, what do you
think of the affair? Do you think you can succeed in it?"</p>

<p>"Before I can answer that I must know what it is about."</p>

<p>"I thought you knew."</p>

<p>"No; so I must ask you for full particulars, even to the
smallest detail. First, what is the nature of the case?"</p>

<p>"A theft."</p>

<p>"When did it take place?"</p>

<p>"Last Saturday," replied the baron, "or, at least, some time
during Saturday night or Sunday morning."</p>

<p>"That was six days ago. Now, you can tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"In the first place, monsieur, I must tell you that my wife and
I, conforming to the manner of life that our position demands, go
out very little. The education of our children, a few receptions,
and the care and decoration of our house&mdash;such constitutes our
life; and nearly all our evenings are spent in this little room,
which is my wife's boudoir, and in which we have gathered a few
artistic objects. Last Saturday night, about eleven o'clock, I
turned off the electric lights, and my wife and I retired, as
usual, to our room."</p>

<p>"Where is your room?"</p>

<p>"It adjoins this. That is the door. Next morning, that is to
say, Sunday morning, I arose quite early. As Suzanne, my wife, was
still asleep, I passed into the boudoir as quietly as possible so
as not to wake her. What was my astonishment when I found that
window open&mdash;as we had left it closed the evening before!"</p>

<p>"A servant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No one enters here in the morning until we ring. Besides, I
always take the precaution to bolt the second door which
communicates with the antechamber. Therefore, the window must have
been opened from the outside. Besides, I have some evidence of
that: the second pane of glass from the right&mdash;close to the
fastening&mdash;had been cut."</p>

<p>"And what does that window overlook?"</p>

<p>"As you can see for yourself, it opens on a little balcony,
surrounded by a stone railing. Here, we are on the first floor, and
you can see the garden behind the house and the iron fence which
separates it from the Parc Monceau. It is quite certain that the
thief came through the park, climbed the fence by the aid of a
ladder, and thus reached the terrace below the window."</p>

<p>"That is quite certain, you say?"</p>

<p>"Well, in the soft earth on either side of the fence, they found
the two holes made by the bottom of the ladder, and two similar
holes can be seen below the window. And the stone railing of the
balcony shows two scratches which were doubtless made by the
contact of the ladder."</p>

<p>"Is the Parc Monceau closed at night?"</p>

<p>"No; but if it were, there is a house in course of erection at
number 14, and a person could enter that way."</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes reflected for a few minutes, and then said:</p>

<p>"Let us come down to the theft. It must have been committed in
this room?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there was here, between that twelfth century Virgin and
that tabernacle of chased silver, a small Jewish lamp. It has
disappeared."</p>

<p>"And is that all?"</p>

<p>"That is all."</p>

<p>"Ah!...And what is a Jewish lamp?"</p>

<p>"One of those copper lamps used by the ancient Jews, consisting
of a standard which supported a bowl containing the oil, and from
this bowl projected several burners intended for the wicks."</p>

<p>"Upon the whole, an object of small value."</p>

<p>"No great value, of course. But this one contained a secret
hiding-place in which we were accustomed to place a magnificent
jewel, a chimera in gold, set with rubies and emeralds, which was
of great value."</p>

<p>"Why did you hide it there?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I can't give any reason, monsieur, unless it was an odd
fancy to utilize a hiding-place of that kind."</p>

<p>"Did anyone know it?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"No one&mdash;except the thief," said Sholmes. "Otherwise he
would not have taken the trouble to steal the lamp."</p>

<p>"Of course. But how could he know it, as it was only by accident
that the secret mechanism of the lamp was revealed to us."</p>

<p>"A similar accident has revealed it to someone else...a
servant...or an acquaintance. But let us proceed: I suppose the
police have been notified?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The examining magistrate has completed his investigation.
The reporter-detectives attached to the leading newspapers have
also made their investigations. But, as I wrote to you, it seems to
me the mystery will never be solved."</p>

<p>Sholmes arose, went to the window, examined the casement, the
balcony, the terrace, studied the scratches on the stone railing
with his magnifying-glass, and then requested Mon. d'Imblevalle to
show him the garden.</p>

<p>Outside, Sholmes sat down in a rattan chair and gazed at the
roof of the house in a dreamy way. Then he walked over to the two
little wooden boxes with which they had covered the holes made in
the ground by the bottom of the ladder with a view of preserving
them intact. He raised the boxes, kneeled on the ground,
scrutinized the holes and made some measurements. After making a
similar examination of the holes near the fence, he and the baron
returned to the boudoir where Madame d'Imblevalle was waiting for
them. After a short silence Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"At the very outset of your story, baron, I was surprised at the
very simple methods employed by the thief. To raise a ladder, cut a
windowpane, select a valuable article, and walk out again&mdash;no,
that is not the way such things are done. All that is too plain,
too simple."</p>

<p>"Well, what do you think?"</p>

<p>"That the Jewish lamp was stolen under the direction of Arsène
Lupin."</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin!" exclaimed the baron.</p>

<p>"Yes, but he did not do it himself, as no one came from the
outside. Perhaps a servant descended from the upper floor by means
of a waterspout that I noticed when I was in the garden."</p>

<p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin would not leave this room empty-handed."</p>

<p>"Empty-handed! But he had the lamp."</p>

<p>"But that would not have prevented his taking that snuffbox, set
with diamonds, or that opal necklace. When he leaves anything, it
is because he can't carry it away."</p>

<p>"But the marks of the ladder outside?"</p>

<p>"A false scent. Placed there simply to avert suspicion."</p>

<p>"And the scratches on the balustrade?"</p>

<p>"A farce! They were made with a piece of sandpaper. See, here
are scraps of the paper that I picked up in the garden."</p>

<p>"And what about the marks made by the bottom of the ladder?"</p>

<p>"Counterfeit! Examine the two rectangular holes below the
window, and the two holes near the fence. They are of a similar
form, but I find that the two holes near the house are closer to
each other than the two holes near the fence. What does that fact
suggest? To me, it suggested that the four holes were made by a
piece of wood prepared for the purpose."</p>

<p>"The better proof would be the piece of wood itself."</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Sholmes, "I found it in the garden, under the
box of a laurel tree."</p>

<p>The baron bowed to Sholmes in recognition of his skill. Only
forty minutes had elapsed since the Englishman had entered the
house, and he had already exploded all the theories theretofore
formed, and which had been based on what appeared to be obvious and
undeniable facts. But what now appeared to be the real facts of the
case rested upon a more solid foundation, to-wit, the astute
reasoning of a Herlock Sholmes.</p>

<p>"The accusation which you make against one of our household is a
very serious matter," said the baroness. "Our servants have been
with us a long time and none of them would betray our trust."</p>

<p>"If none of them has betrayed you, how can you explain the fact
that I received this letter on the same day and by the same mail as
the letter you wrote to me?"</p>

<p>He handed to the baroness the letter that he had received from
Arsène Lupin. She exclaimed, in amazement:</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin! How could he know?"</p>

<p>"Did you tell anyone that you had written to me?"</p>

<p>"No one," replied the baron. "The idea occurred to us the other
evening at the dinner-table."</p>

<p>"Before the servants?"</p>

<p>"No, only our two children. Oh, no...Sophie and Henriette had
left the table, hadn't they, Suzanne?"</p>

<p>Madame d'Imblevalle, after a moment's reflection, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, they had gone to Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle?" queried Sholmes.</p>

<p>"The governess, Mademoiselle Alice Demun."</p>

<p>"Does she take her meals with you?"</p>

<p>"No. Her meals are served in her room."</p>

<p>Wilson had an idea. He said:</p>

<p>"The letter written to my friend Herlock Sholmes was
posted?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Who posted it?"</p>

<p>"Dominique, who has been my valet for twenty years," replied the
baron. "Any search in that direction would be a waste of time."</p>

<p>"One never wastes his time when engaged in a search," said
Wilson, sententiously.</p>

<p>This preliminary investigation now ended, and Sholmes asked
permission to retire.</p>

<p>At dinner, an hour later, he saw Sophie and Henriette, the two
children of the family, one was six and the other eight years of
age. There was very little conversation at the table. Sholmes
responded to the friendly advances of his hosts in such a curt
manner that they were soon reduced to silence. When the coffee was
served, Sholmes swallowed the contents of his cup, and rose to take
his leave.</p>

<p>At that moment, a servant entered with a telephone message
addressed to Sholmes. He opened it, and read:</p>

<p class="letter">You have my enthusiastic admiration. The results
attained by you in so short a time are simply marvellous. I am
dismayed.<br>
<br>
Arsène Lupin.</p>

<p>Sholmes made a gesture of indignation and handed the message to
the baron, saying:</p>

<p>"What do you think now, monsieur? Are the walls of your house
furnished with eyes and ears?"</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said the baron, in amazement.</p>

<p>"Nor do I; but I do understand that Lupin has knowledge of
everything that occurs in this house. He knows every movement,
every word. There is no doubt of it. But how does he get his
information? That is the first mystery I have to solve, and when I
know that I will know everything."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>That night, Wilson retired with the clear conscience of a man
who has performed his whole duty and thus acquired an undoubted
right to sleep and repose. So he fell asleep very quickly, and was
soon enjoying the most delightful dreams in which he pursued Lupin
and captured him single-handed; and the sensation was so vivid and
exciting that it woke him from his sleep. Someone was standing at
his bedside. He seized his revolver, and cried:</p>

<p>"Don't move, Lupin, or I'll fire."</p>

<p>"The deuce! Wilson, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it is you, Sholmes. Do you want me?"</p>

<p>"I want to show you something. Get up."</p>

<p>Sholmes led him to the window, and said:</p>

<p>"Look!...on the other side of the fence..."</p>

<p>"In the park?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you see?"</p>

<p>"I don't see anything."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do see something."</p>

<p>"Ah! of course, a shadow...two of them."</p>

<p>"Yes, close to the fence. See, they are moving. Come,
quick!"</p>

<p>Quickly they descended the stairs, and reached a room which
opened into the garden. Through the glass door they could see the
two shadowy forms in the same place.</p>

<p>"It is very strange," said Sholmes, "but it seems to me I can
hear a noise inside the house."</p>

<p>"Inside the house? Impossible! Everybody is asleep."</p>

<p>"Well, listen&mdash;"</p>

<p>At that moment a low whistle came from the other side of the
fence, and they perceived a dim light which appeared to come from
the house.</p>

<p>"The baron must have turned on the light in his room. It is just
above us."</p>

<p>"That must have been the noise you heard," said Wilson. "Perhaps
they are watching the fence also."</p>

<p>Then there was a second whistle, softer than before.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it; I don't understand," said Sholmes,
irritably.</p>

<p>"No more do I," confessed Wilson.</p>

<p>Sholmes turned the key, drew the bolt, and quietly opened the
door. A third whistle, louder than before, and modulated to another
form. And the noise above their heads became more pronounced.
Sholmes said:</p>

<p>"It seems to be on the balcony outside the boudoir window."</p>

<p>He put his head through the half-opened door, but immediately
recoiled, with a stifled oath. Then Wilson looked. Quite close to
them there was a ladder, the upper end of which was resting on the
balcony.</p>

<p>"The deuce!" said Sholmes, "there is someone in the boudoir.
That is what we heard. Quick, let us remove the ladder."</p>

<p>But at that instant a man slid down the ladder and ran toward
the spot where his accomplices were waiting for him outside the
fence. He carried the ladder with him. Sholmes and Wilson pursued
the man and overtook him just as he was placing the ladder against
the fence. From the other side of the fence two shots were
fired.</p>

<p>"Wounded?" cried Sholmes.</p>

<p>"No," replied Wilson.</p>

<p>Wilson seized the man by the body and tried to hold him, but the
man turned and plunged a knife into Wilson's breast. He uttered a
groan, staggered and fell.</p>

<p>"Damnation!" muttered Sholmes, "if they have killed him I will
kill them."</p>

<p>He laid Wilson on the grass and rushed toward the ladder. Too
late&mdash;the man had climbed the fence and, accompanied by his
confederates, had fled through the bushes.</p>

<p>"Wilson, Wilson, it is not serious, <i>hein</i>? Merely a
scratch."</p>

<p>The house door opened, and Monsieur d'Imblevalle appeared,
followed by the servants, carrying candles.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked the baron. "Is Monsieur Wilson
wounded?"</p>

<p>"Oh! it's nothing&mdash;a mere scratch," repeated Sholmes,
trying to deceive himself.</p>

<p>The blood was flowing profusely, and Wilson's face was livid.
Twenty minutes later the doctor ascertained that the point of the
knife had penetrated to within an inch and a half of the heart.</p>

<p>"An inch and a half of the heart! Wilson always was lucky!" said
Sholmes, in an envious tone.</p>

<p>"Lucky...lucky..." muttered the doctor.</p>

<p>"Of course! Why, with his robust constitution he will soon be
out again."</p>

<p>"Six weeks in bed and two months of convalescence."</p>

<p>"Not more?"</p>

<p>"No, unless complications set in."</p>

<p>"Oh! the devil! what does he want complications for?"</p>

<p>Fully reassured, Sholmes joined the baron in the boudoir. This
time the mysterious visitor had not exercised the same restraint.
Ruthlessly, he had laid his vicious hand upon the diamond snuffbox,
upon the opal necklace, and, in a general way, upon everything that
could find a place in the greedy pockets of an enterprising
burglar.</p>

<p>The window was still open; one of the windowpanes had been
neatly cut; and, in the morning, a summary investigation showed
that the ladder belonged to the house then in course of
construction.</p>

<p>"Now, you can see," said Mon. d'Imblevalle, with a touch of
irony, "it is an exact repetition of the affair of the Jewish
lamp."</p>

<p>"Yes, if we accept the first theory adopted by the police."</p>

<p>"Haven't you adopted it yet? Doesn't this second theft shatter
your theory in regard to the first?"</p>

<p>"It only confirms it, monsieur."</p>

<p>"That is incredible! You have positive evidence that last
night's theft was committed by an outsider, and yet you adhere to
your theory that the Jewish lamp was stolen by someone in the
house."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am sure of it."</p>

<p>"How do you explain it?"</p>

<p>"I do not explain anything, monsieur; I have established two
facts which do not appear to have any relation to each other, and
yet I am seeking the missing link that connects them."</p>

<p>His conviction seemed to be so earnest and positive that the
baron submitted to it, and said:</p>

<p>"Very well, we will notify the police&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not at all!" exclaimed the Englishman, quickly, "not at all! I
intend to ask for their assistance when I need it&mdash;but not
before."</p>

<p>"But the attack on your friend?"</p>

<p>"That's of no consequence. He is only wounded. Secure the
license of the doctor. I shall be responsible for the legal side of
the affair."</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The next two days proved uneventful. Yet Sholmes was
investigating the case with a minute care, and with a sense of
wounded pride resulting from that audacious theft, committed under
his nose, in spite of his presence and beyond his power to prevent
it. He made a thorough investigation of the house and garden,
interviewed the servants, and paid lengthy visits to the kitchen
and stables. And, although his efforts were fruitless, he did not
despair.</p>

<p>"I will succeed," he thought, "and the solution must be sought
within the walls of this house. This affair is quite different from
that of the blonde Lady, where I had to work in the dark, on
unknown ground. This time I am on the battlefield itself. The enemy
is not the elusive and invisible Lupin, but the accomplice, in
flesh and blood, who lives and moves within the confines of this
house. Let me secure the slightest clue and the game is mine!"</p>

<p>That clue was furnished to him by accident.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day, when he entered a room
located above the boudoir, which served as a study for the
children, he found Henriette, the younger of the two sisters. She
was looking for her scissors.</p>

<p>"You know," she said to Sholmes, "I make papers like that you
received the other evening."</p>

<p>"The other evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes, just as dinner was over, you received a paper with marks
on it...you know, a telegram...Well, I make them, too."</p>

<p>She left the room. To anyone else these words would seem to be
nothing more than the insignificant remark of a child, and Sholmes
himself listened to them with a distracted air and continued his
investigation. But, suddenly, he ran after the child, and overtook
her at the head of the stairs. He said to her:</p>

<p>"So you paste stamps and marks on papers?"</p>

<p>Henriette, very proudly, replied:</p>

<p>"Yes, I cut them out and paste them on."</p>

<p>"Who taught you that little game?"</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle...my governess...I have seen her do it often. She
takes words out of the newspapers and pastes them&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What does she make out of them?"</p>

<p>"Telegrams and letters that she sends away."</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes returned to the study, greatly puzzled by the
information and seeking to draw from it a logical deduction. There
was a pile of newspapers on the mantel. He opened them and found
that many words and, in some places, entire lines had been cut out.
But, after reading a few of the word's which preceded or followed,
he decided that the missing words had been cut out at
random&mdash;probably by the child. It was possible that one of the
newspapers had been cut by mademoiselle; but how could he assure
himself that such was the case?</p>

<p>Mechanically, Sholmes turned over the schoolbooks on the table;
then others which were lying on the shelf of a bookcase. Suddenly
he uttered a cry of joy. In a corner of the bookcase, under a pile
of old exercise books, he found a child's alphabet-book, in which
the letters were ornamented with pictures, and on one of the pages
of that book he discovered a place where a word had been removed.
He examined it. It was a list of the days of the week. Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. The word "Saturday" was missing. Now, the
theft of the Jewish lamp had occurred on a Saturday night.</p>

<p>Sholmes experienced that slight fluttering of the heart which
always announced to him, in the clearest manner, that he had
discovered the road which leads to victory. That ray of truth, that
feeling of certainty, never deceived him.</p>

<p>With nervous fingers he hastened to examine the balance of the
book. Very soon he made another discovery. It was a page composed
of capital letters, followed by a line of figures. Nine of those
letters and three of those figures had been carefully cut out.
Sholmes made a list of the missing letters and figures in his
memorandum book, in alphabetical and numerical order, and obtained
the following result:</p>

<p class="cp">CDEHNOPRZ&mdash;237.</p>

<p>"Well! at first sight, it is a rather formidable puzzle," he
murmured, "but, by transposing the letters and using all of them,
is it possible to form one, two or three complete words?"</p>

<p>Sholmes tried it, in vain.</p>

<p>Only one solution seemed possible; it constantly appeared before
him, no matter which way he tried to juggle the letters, until, at
length, he was satisfied it was the true solution, since it
harmonized with the logic of the facts and the general
circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>As that page of the book did not contain any duplicate letters
it was probable, in fact quite certain, that the words he could
form from those letters would be incomplete, and that the original
words had been completed with letters taken from other pages. Under
those conditions he obtained the following solution, errors and
omissions excepted:</p>

<p class="cp">REPOND Z&mdash;CH&mdash;237.</p>

<p>The first word was quite clear: <i>répondez</i> [reply], a
letter E is missing because it occurs twice in the word, and the
book furnished only one letter of each kind.</p>

<p>As to the second incomplete word, no doubt it formed, with the
aid of the number 237, an address to which the reply was to be
sent. They appointed Saturday as the time, and requested a reply to
be sent to the address CH. 237.</p>

<p>Or, perhaps, CH. 237 was an address for a letter to be sent to
the "general delivery" of some postoffice, or, again, they might
form a part of some incomplete word. Sholmes searched the book once
more, but did not discover that any other letters had been removed.
Therefore, until further orders, he decided to adhere to the
foregoing interpretation.</p>

<p>Henriette returned and observed what he was doing.</p>

<p>"Amusing, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very amusing," he replied. "But, have you any other
papers?...Or, rather, words already cut out that I can paste?"</p>

<p>"Papers?...No...And Mademoiselle wouldn't like it."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she has scolded me already."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I have told you some things...and she says that a
person should never tell things about those they love."</p>

<p>"You are quite right."</p>

<p>Henriette was delighted to receive his approbation, in fact so
highly pleased that she took from a little silk bag that was pinned
to her dress some scraps of cloth, three buttons, two cubes of
sugar and, lastly, a piece of paper which she handed to
Sholmes.</p>

<p>"See, I give it to you just the same."</p>

<p>It was the number of a cab&mdash;8,279.</p>

<p>"Where did this number come from?"</p>

<p>"It fell out of her pocketbook."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"Sunday, at mass, when she was taking out some sous for the
collection."</p>

<p>"Exactly! And now I shall tell you how to keep from being
scolded again. Do not tell Mademoiselle that you saw me."</p>

<p>Sholmes then went to Mon. d'Imblevalle and questioned him in
regard to Mademoiselle. The baron replied, indignantly:</p>

<p>"Alice Demun! How can you imagine such a thing? It is utterly
impossible!"</p>

<p>"How long has she been in your service?"</p>

<p>"Only a year, but there is no one in the house in whom I have
greater confidence."</p>

<p>"Why have I not seen her yet?"</p>

<p>"She has been away for a few days."</p>

<p>"But she is here now."</p>

<p>"Yes; since her return she has been watching at the bedside of
your friend. She has all the qualities of a
nurse...gentle...thoughtful...Monsieur Wilson seems much
pleased..."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Sholmes, who had completely neglected to inquire
about his friend. After a moment's reflection he asked:</p>

<p>"Did she go out on Sunday morning?"</p>

<p>"The day after the theft?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The baron called his wife and asked her. She replied:</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle went to the eleven o'clock mass with the children,
as usual."</p>

<p>"But before that?"</p>

<p>"Before that? No...Let me see!...I was so upset by the
theft...but I remember now that, on the evening before, she asked
permission to go out on Sunday morning...to see a cousin who was
passing through Paris, I think. But, surely, you don't suspect
her?"</p>

<p>"Of course not...but I would like to see her."</p>

<p>He went to Wilson's room. A woman dressed in a gray cloth dress,
as in the hospitals, was bending over the invalid, giving him a
drink. When she turned her face Sholmes recognized her as the young
girl who had accosted him at the railway station.</p>

<p>Alice Demun smiled sweetly; her great serious, innocent eyes
showed no sign of embarrassment. The Englishman tried to speak,
muttered a few syllables, and stopped. Then she resumed her work,
acting quite naturally under Sholmes' astonished gaze, moved the
bottles, unrolled and rolled cotton bandages, and again regarded
Sholmes with her charming smile of pure innocence.</p>

<p>He turned on his heels, descended the stairs, noticed Mon.
d'Imblevalle's automobile in the courtyard, jumped into it, and
went to Levallois, to the office of the cab company whose address
was printed on the paper he had received from Henriette. The man
who had driven carriage number 8,279 on Sunday morning not being
there, Sholmes dismissed the automobile and waited for the man's
return. He told Sholmes that he had picked up a woman in the
vicinity of the Parc Monceau, a young woman dressed in black,
wearing a heavy veil, and, apparently, quite nervous.</p>

<p>"Did she have a package?"</p>

<p>"Yes, quite a long package."</p>

<p>"Where did you take her?"</p>

<p>"Avenue des Ternes, corner of the Place Saint-Ferdinand. She
remained there about ten minutes, and then returned to the Parc
Monceau."</p>

<p>"Could you recognize the house in the avenue des Ternes?"</p>

<p>"<i>Parbleu!</i> Shall I take you there?"</p>

<p>"Presently. First take me to 36 quai des Orfèvres."</p>

<p>At the police office he saw Detective Ganimard.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Ganimard, are you at liberty?"</p>

<p>"If it has anything to do with Lupin&mdash;no!"</p>

<p>"It has something to do with Lupin."</p>

<p>"Then I do not go."</p>

<p>"What! you surrender&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I bow to the inevitable. I am tired of the unequal struggle, in
which we are sure to be defeated. Lupin is stronger than I
am&mdash;stronger than the two of us; therefore, we must
surrender."</p>

<p>"I will not surrender."</p>

<p>"He will make you, as he has all others."</p>

<p>"And you would be pleased to see it&mdash;eh, Ganimard?"</p>

<p>"At all events, it is true," said Ganimard, frankly. "And since
you are determined to pursue the game, I will go with you."</p>

<p>Together they entered the carriage and were driven to the avenue
des Ternes. Upon their order the carriage stopped on the other side
of the street, at some distance from the house, in front of a
little café, on the terrace of which the two men took seats amongst
the shrubbery. It was commencing to grow dark.</p>

<p>"Waiter," said Sholmes, "some writing material."</p>

<p>He wrote a note, recalled the waiter and gave him the letter
with instructions to deliver it to the concierge of the house which
he pointed out.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the concierge stood before them. Sholmes asked
him if, on the Sunday morning, he had seen a young woman dressed in
black.</p>

<p>"In black? Yes, about nine o'clock. She went to the second
floor."</p>

<p>"Have you seen her often?"</p>

<p>"No, but for some time&mdash;well, during the last few weeks, I
have seen her almost every day."</p>

<p>"And since Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Only once...until today."</p>

<p>"What! Did she come today?"</p>

<p>"She is here now."</p>

<p>"Here now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she came about ten minutes ago. Her carriage is standing
in the Place Saint-Ferdinand, as usual. I met her at the door."</p>

<p>"Who is the occupant of the second floor?"</p>

<p>"There are two: a modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais, and a
gentleman who rented two furnished rooms a month ago under the name
of Bresson."</p>

<p>"Why do you say 'under the name'?"</p>

<p>"Because I have an idea that it is an assumed name. My wife
takes care of his rooms, and...well, there are not two shirts there
with the same initials."</p>

<p>"Is he there much of the time?"</p>

<p>"No; he is nearly always out. He has not been here for three
days."</p>

<p>"Was he here on Saturday night?"</p>

<p>"Saturday night?...Let me think...Yes, Saturday night, he came
in and stayed all night."</p>

<p>"What sort of a man is he?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can scarcely answer that. He is so changeable. He is,
by turns, big, little, fat, thin...dark and light. I do not always
recognize him."</p>

<p>Ganimard and Sholmes exchanged looks.</p>

<p>"That is he, all right," said Ganimard.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the concierge, "there is the girl now."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle had just emerged from the house and was walking
toward her carriage in the Place Saint-Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"And there is Monsieur Bresson."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Bresson? Which is he?"</p>

<p>"The man with the parcel under his arm."</p>

<p>"But he is not looking after the girl. She is going to her
carriage alone."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have never seen them together."</p>

<p>The two detectives had arisen. By the light of the street-lamps
they recognized the form of Arsène Lupin, who had started off in a
direction opposite to that taken by the girl.</p>

<p>"Which will you follow?" asked Ganimard.</p>

<p>"I will follow him, of course. He's the biggest game."</p>

<p>"Then I will follow the girl," proposed Ganimard.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Sholmes, quickly, who did not wish to disclose
the girl's identity to Ganimard, "I know where to find her. Come
with me."</p>

<p>They followed Lupin at a safe distance, taking care to conceal
themselves as well as possible amongst the moving throng and behind
the newspaper kiosks. They found the pursuit an easy one, as he
walked steadily forward without turning to the right or left, but
with a slight limp in the right leg, so slight as to require the
keen eye of a professional observer to detect it. Ganimard observed
it, and said:</p>

<p>"He is pretending to be lame. Ah! if we could only collect two
or three policemen and pounce on our man! We run a chance to lose
him."</p>

<p>But they did not meet any policemen before they reached the
Porte des Ternes, and, having passed the fortifications, there was
no prospect of receiving any assistance.</p>

<p>"We had better separate," said Sholmes, "as there are so few
people on the street."</p>

<p>They were now on the Boulevard Victor-Hugo. They walked one on
each side of the street, and kept well in the shadow of the trees.
They continued thus for twenty minutes, when Lupin turned to the
left and followed the Seine. Very soon they saw him descend to the
edge of the river. He remained there only a few seconds, but they
could not observe his movements. Then Lupin retraced his steps. His
pursuers concealed themselves in the shadow of a gateway. Lupin
passed in front of them. His parcel had disappeared. And as he
walked away another man emerged from the shelter of a house and
glided amongst the trees.</p>

<p>"He seems to be following him also," said Sholmes, in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The pursuit continued, but was now embarrassed by the presence
of the third man. Lupin returned the same way, passed through the
Porte des Ternes, and re-entered the house in the avenue des
Ternes.</p>

<p>The concierge was closing the house for the night when Ganimard
presented himself.</p>

<p>"Did you see him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the concierge, "I was putting out the gas on the
landing when he closed and bolted his door."</p>

<p>"Is there any person with him?"</p>

<p>"No; he has no servant. He never eats here."</p>

<p>"Is there a servants' stairway?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Ganimard said to Sholmes:</p>

<p>"I had better stand at the door of his room while you go for the
commissary of police in the rue Demours."</p>

<p>"And if he should escape during that time?" said Sholmes.</p>

<p>"While I am here! He can't escape."</p>

<p>"One to one, with Lupin, is not an even chance for you."</p>

<p>"Well, I can't force the door. I have no right to do that,
especially at night."</p>

<p>Sholmes shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>

<p>"When you arrest Lupin no one will question the methods by which
you made the arrest. However, let us go up and ring, and see what
happens then."</p>

<p>They ascended to the second floor. There was a double door at
the left of the landing. Ganimard rang the bell. No reply. He rang
again. Still no reply.</p>

<p>"Let us go in," said Sholmes.</p>

<p>"All right, come on," replied Ganimard.</p>

<p>Yet, they stood still, irresolute. Like people who hesitate when
they ought to accomplish a decisive action they feared to move, and
it seemed to them impossible that Arsène Lupin was there, so close
to them, on the other side of that fragile door that could be
broken down by one blow of the fist. But they knew Lupin too well
to suppose that he would allow himself to be trapped in that stupid
manner. No, no&mdash;a thousand times, no&mdash;Lupin was no longer
there. Through the adjoining houses, over the roofs, by some
conveniently prepared exit, he must have already made his escape,
and, once more, it would only be Lupin's shadow that they would
seize.</p>

<p>They shuddered as a slight noise, coming from the other side of
the door, reached their ears. Then they had the impression,
amounting almost to a certainty, that he was there, separated from
them by that frail wooden door, and that he was listening to them,
that he could hear them.</p>

<p>What was to be done? The situation was a serious one. In spite
of their vast experience as detectives, they were so nervous and
excited that they thought they could hear the beating of their own
hearts. Ganimard questioned Sholmes by a look. Then he struck the
door a violent blow with his fist. Immediately they heard the sound
of footsteps, concerning which there was no attempt at
concealment.</p>

<p>Ganimard shook the door. Then he and Sholmes, uniting their
efforts, rushed at the door, and burst it open with their
shoulders. Then they stood still, in surprise. A shot had been
fired in the adjoining room. Another shot, and the sound of a
falling body.</p>

<p>When they entered they saw the man lying on the floor with his
face toward the marble mantel. His revolver had fallen from his
hand. Ganimard stooped and turned the man's head. The face was
covered with blood, which was flowing from two wounds, one in the
cheek, the other in the temple.</p>

<p>"You can't recognize him for blood."</p>

<p>"No matter!" said Sholmes. "It is not Lupin."</p>

<p>"How do you know? You haven't even looked at him."</p>

<p>"Do you think that Arsène Lupin is the kind of a man that would
kill himself?" asked Sholmes, with a sneer.</p>

<p>"But we thought we recognized him outside."</p>

<p>"We thought so, because the wish was father to the thought. That
man has us bewitched."</p>

<p>"Then it must be one of his accomplices."</p>

<p>"The accomplices of Arsène Lupin do not kill themselves."</p>

<p>"Well, then, who is it?"</p>

<p>They searched the corpse. In one pocket Herlock Sholmes found an
empty pocketbook; in another Ganimard found several <i>louis</i>.
There were no marks of identification on any part of his clothing.
In a trunk and two valises they found nothing but wearing apparel.
On the mantel there was a pile of newspapers. Ganimard opened them.
All of them contained articles referring to the theft of the Jewish
lamp.</p>

<p>An hour later, when Ganimard and Sholmes left the house, they
had acquired no further knowledge of the strange individual who had
been driven to suicide by their untimely visit.</p>

<p>Who was he? Why had he killed himself? What was his connection
with the affair of the Jewish lamp? Who had followed him on his
return from the river? The situation involved many complex
questions&mdash;many mysteries&mdash;</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes went to bed in a very bad humor. Early next
morning he received the following telephonic message:</p>

<p class="letter">"Arsène Lupin has the honor to inform you of his tragic death in
the person of Monsieur Bresson, and requests the honor of your
presence at the funeral service and burial, which will be held at
the public expense on Thursday, 25 June."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>Chapter 8. The Shipwreck</h2>

<p>"That's what I don't like, Wilson," said Herlock Sholmes, after
he had read Arsène Lupin's message; "that is what exasperates me in
this affair&mdash;to feel that the cunning, mocking eye of that
fellow follows me everywhere. He sees everything; he knows
everything; he reads my inmost thoughts; he even foresees my
slightest movement. Ah! he is possessed of a marvellous intuition,
far surpassing that of the most instinctive woman, yes, surpassing
even that of Herlock Sholmes himself. Nothing escapes him. I
resemble an actor whose every step and movement are directed by a
stage-manager; who says this and does that in obedience to a
superior will. That is my position. Do you understand, Wilson?"</p>

<p>Certainly Wilson would have understood if his faculties had not
been deadened by the profound slumber of a man whose temperature
varies between one hundred and one hundred and three degrees. But
whether he heard or not was a matter of no consequence to Herlock
Sholmes, who continued:</p>

<p>"I have to concentrate all my energy and bring all my resources
into action in order to make the slightest progress. And,
fortunately for me, those petty annoyances are like so many pricks
from a needle and serve only to stimulate me. As soon as the heat
of the wound is appeased and the shock to my vanity has subsided I
say to myself: 'Amuse yourself, my dear fellow, but remember that
he who laughs last laughs best. Sooner or later you will betray
yourself.' For you know, Wilson, it was Lupin himself, who, by his
first dispatch and the observation that it suggested to little
Henriette, disclosed to me the secret of his correspondence with
Alice Hemun. Have you forgotten that circumstance, dear boy?"</p>

<p>But Wilson was asleep; and Sholmes, pacing to and fro, resumed
his speech:</p>

<p>"And, now, things are not in a bad shape; a little obscure,
perhaps, but the light is creeping in. In the first place, I must
learn all about Monsieur Bresson. Ganimard and I will visit the
bank of the river, at the spot where Bresson threw away the
package, and the particular role of that gentleman will be known to
me. After that the game will be played between me and Alice Demun.
Rather a lightweight opponent, <i>hein</i>, Wilson? And do you not
think that I will soon know the phrase represented by the letters
clipped from the alphabet-book, and what the isolated
letters&mdash;the 'C' and the 'H'&mdash;mean? That is all I want to
know, Wilson."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle entered at that moment, and, observing Sholmes
gesticulating, she said, in her sweetest manner:</p>

<p>"Monsieur Sholmes, I must scold you if you waken my patient. It
isn't nice of you to disturb him. The doctor has ordered absolute
rest."</p>

<p>He looked at her in silence, astonished, as on their first
meeting, at her wonderful self-possession.</p>

<p>"Why do you look at me so, Monsieur Sholmes?...You seem to be
trying to read my thoughts...No?...Then what is it?"</p>

<p>She questioned him with the most innocent expression on her
pretty face and in her frank blue eyes. A smile played upon her
lips; and she displayed so much unaffected candor that the
Englishman almost lost his temper. He approached her and said, in a
low voice:</p>

<p>"Bresson killed himself last night."</p>

<p>She affected not to understand him; so he repeated:</p>

<p>"Bresson killed himself yesterday..."</p>

<p>She did not show the slightest emotion; she acted as if the
matter did not concern or interest her in any way.</p>

<p>"You have been informed," said Sholmes, displaying his
annoyance. "Otherwise, the news would have caused you to start, at
least. Ah! you are stronger than I expected. But what's the use of
your trying to conceal anything from me?"</p>

<p>He picked up the alphabet-book, which he had placed on a
convenient table, and, opening it at the mutilated page, said:</p>

<p>"Will you tell me the order in which the missing letters should
be arranged in order to express the exact wording of the message
you sent to Bresson four days before the theft of the Jewish
lamp?"</p>

<p>"The order?...Bresson?...the theft of the Jewish lamp?"</p>

<p>She repeated the words slowly, as if trying to grasp their
meaning. He continued:</p>

<p>"Yes. Here are the letters employed...on this bit of
paper...What did you say to Bresson?"</p>

<p>"The letters employed...what did I say..."</p>

<p>Suddenly she burst into laughter:</p>

<p>"Ah! that is it! I understand! I am an accomplice in the crime!
There is a Monsieur Bresson who stole the Jewish lamp and who has
now committed suicide. And I am the friend of that gentleman. Oh!
how absurd you are!"</p>

<p>"Whom did you go to see last night on the second floor of a
house in the avenue des Ternes?"</p>

<p>"Who? My modiste, Mademoiselle Langeais. Do you suppose that my
modiste and my friend Monsieur Bresson are the same person?"</p>

<p>Despite all he knew, Sholmes was now in doubt. A person can
feign terror, joy, anxiety, in fact all emotions; but a person
cannot feign absolute indifference or light, careless laughter. Yet
he continued to question her:</p>

<p>"Why did you accost me the other evening at the Northern Railway
station? And why did you entreat me to leave Paris immediately
without investigating this theft?"</p>

<p>"Ah! you are too inquisitive, Monsieur Sholmes," she replied,
still laughing in the most natural manner. "To punish you I will
tell you nothing, and, besides, you must watch the patient while I
go to the pharmacy on an urgent message. Au revoir."</p>

<p>She left the room.</p>

<p>"I am beaten...by a girl," muttered Sholmes. "Not only did I get
nothing out of her but I exposed my hand and put her on her
guard."</p>

<p>And he recalled the affair of the blue diamond and his first
interview with Clotilde Destange. Had not the blonde Lady met his
question with the same unruffled serenity, and was he not once more
face to face with one of those creatures who, under the protection
and influence of Arsène Lupin, maintain the utmost coolness in the
face of a terrible danger?</p>

<p>"Sholmes...Sholmes..."</p>

<p>It was Wilson who called him. Sholmes approached the bed, and,
leaning over, said:</p>

<p>"What's the matter, Wilson? Does your wound pain you?"</p>

<p>Wilson's lips moved, but he could not speak. At last, with a
great effort, he stammered:</p>

<p>"No...Sholmes...it is not she...that is impossible&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, Wilson, what do you know about it? I tell you that it is
she! It is only when I meet one of Lupin's creatures, prepared and
instructed by him, that I lose my head and make a fool of
myself...I bet you that within an hour Lupin will know all about
our interview. Within an hour? What am I saying?...Why, he may know
already. The visit to the pharmacy...urgent message. All
nonsense!...She has gone to telephone to Lupin."</p>

<p>Sholmes left the house hurriedly, went down the avenue de
Messine, and was just in time to see Mademoiselle enter a pharmacy.
Ten minutes later she emerged from the shop carrying some small
packages and a bottle wrapped in white paper. But she had not
proceeded far, when she was accosted by a man who, with hat in hand
and an obsequious air, appeared to be asking for charity. She
stopped, gave him something, and proceeded on her way.</p>

<p>"She spoke to him," said the Englishman to himself.</p>

<p>If not a certainty, it was at least an intuition, and quite
sufficient to cause him to change his tactics. Leaving the girl to
pursue her own course, he followed the suspected mendicant, who
walked slowly to the avenue des Ternes and lingered for a long time
around the house in which Bresson had lived, sometimes raising his
eyes to the windows of the second floor and watching the people who
entered the house.</p>

<p>At the end of an hour he climbed to the top of a tramcar going
in the direction of Neuilly. Sholmes followed and took a seat
behind the man, and beside a gentleman who was concealed behind the
pages of a newspaper. At the fortifications the gentleman lowered
the paper, and Sholmes recognized Ganimard, who thereupon
whispered, as he pointed to the man in front:</p>

<p>"It is the man who followed Bresson last night. He has been
watching the house for an hour."</p>

<p>"Anything new in regard to Bresson?" asked Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Yes, a letter came to his address this morning."</p>

<p>"This morning? Then it was posted yesterday before the sender
could know of Bresson's death."</p>

<p>"Exactly. It is now in the possession of the examining
magistrate. But I read it. It says:</p>

<p class="letter">"'He will not accept any compromise. He wants
everything&mdash;the first thing as well as those of the second
affair. Otherwise he will proceed.'"</p>

<p>"There is no signature," added Ganimard. "It seems to me those
few lines won't help us much."</p>

<p>"I don't agree with you, Monsieur Ganimard. To me those few
lines are very interesting."</p>

<p>"Why so? I can't see it."</p>

<p>"For reasons that are personal to me," replied Sholmes, with the
indifference that he frequently displayed toward his colleague.</p>

<p>The tramcar stopped at the rue de Château, which was the
terminus. The man descended and walked away quietly. Sholmes
followed at so short a distance that Ganimard protested,
saying:</p>

<p>"If he should turn around he will suspect us."</p>

<p>"He will not turn around."</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"He is an accomplice of Arsène Lupin, and the fact that he walks
in that manner, with his hands in his pockets, proves, in the first
place, that he knows he is being followed and, in the second place,
that he is not afraid."</p>

<p>"But I think we are keeping too close to him."</p>

<p>"Not too close to prevent his slipping through our fingers. He
is too sure of himself."</p>

<p>"Ah! Look there! In front of that café there are two of the
bicycle police. If I summon them to our assistance, how can the man
slip through our fingers?"</p>

<p>"Well, our friend doesn't seem to be worried about it. In fact,
he is asking for their assistance himself."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i>" exclaimed Ganimard, "he has a nerve."</p>

<p>The man approached the two policemen just as they were mounting
their bicycles. After a few words with them he leaped on a third
bicycle, which was leaning against the wall of the café, and rode
away at a fast pace, accompanied by the two policemen.</p>

<p>"<i>Hein!</i> one, two, three and away!" growled Sholmes. "And
through, whose agency, Monsieur Ganimard? Two of your
colleagues...Ah! but Arsène Lupin has a wonderful organization!
Bicycle policemen in his service!...I told you our man was too
calm, too sure of himself."</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Ganimard, quite vexed, "what are we to do
now? It is easy enough to laugh! Anyone can do that."</p>

<p>"Come, come, don't lose your temper! We will get our revenge.
But, in the meantime, we need reinforcements."</p>

<p>"Folenfant is waiting for me at the end of the avenue de
Neuilly."</p>

<p>"Well, go and get him and join me later. I will follow our
fugitive."</p>

<p>Sholmes followed the bicycle tracks, which were plainly visible
in the dust of the road as two of the machines were furnished with
striated tires. Very soon he ascertained that the tracks were
leading him to the edge of the Seine, and that the three men had
turned in the direction taken by Bresson on the preceding evening.
Thus he arrived at the gateway where he and Ganimard had concealed
themselves, and, a little farther on, he discovered a mingling of
the bicycle tracks which showed that the men had halted at that
spot. Directly opposite there was a little point of land which
projected into the river and, at the extremity thereof, an old boat
was moored.</p>

<p>It was there that Bresson had thrown away the package, or,
rather, had dropped it. Sholmes descended the bank and saw that the
declivity was not steep and the water quite shallow, so it would be
quite easy to recover the package, provided the three men had not
forestalled him.</p>

<p>"No, that can't be," he thought, "they have not had time. A
quarter of an hour at the most. And yet, why did they come this
way?"</p>

<p>A fisherman was seated on the old boat. Sholmes asked him:</p>

<p>"Did you see three men on bicycles a few minutes ago?"</p>

<p>The fisherman made a negative gesture. But Sholmes insisted:</p>

<p>"Three men who stopped on the road just on top of the bank?"</p>

<p>The fisherman rested his pole under his arm, took a memorandum
book from his pocket, wrote on one of the pages, tore it out, and
handed it to Sholmes. The Englishman gave a start of surprise. In
the middle of the paper which he held in his hand he saw the series
of letters cut from the alphabet-book:</p>

<p class="cp">CDEHNOPRZEO&mdash;237.</p>

<p>The man resumed his fishing, sheltered from the sun by a large
straw hat, with his coat and vest lying beside him. He was intently
watching the cork attached to his line as it floated on the surface
of the water.</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence&mdash;solemn and terrible.</p>

<p>"Is it he?" conjectured Sholmes, with an anxiety that was almost
pitiful. Then the truth burst upon him:</p>

<p>"It is he! It is he! No one else could remain there so calmly,
without the slightest display of anxiety, without the least fear of
what might happen. And who else would know the story of those
mysterious letters? Alice had warned him by means of her
messenger."</p>

<p>Suddenly the Englishman felt that his hand&mdash;that his own
hand had involuntarily seized the handle of his revolver, and that
his eyes were fixed on the man's back, a little below the neck. One
movement, and the drama would be finished; the life of the strange
adventurer would come to a miserable end.</p>

<p>The fisherman did not stir.</p>

<p>Sholmes nervously toyed with his revolver, and experienced a
wild desire to fire it and end everything; but the horror of such
an act was repugnant to his nature. Death would be certain and
would end all.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he thought, "let him get up and defend himself. If he
doesn't, so much the worse for him. One second more...and I
fire..."</p>

<p>But a sound of footsteps behind him caused him to turn his head.
It was Ganimard coming with some assistants.</p>

<p>Then, quickly changing his plans, Sholmes leaped into the boat,
which was broken from its moorings by his sudden action; he pounced
upon the man and seized him around the body. They rolled to the
bottom of the boat together.</p>

<p>"Well, now!" exclaimed Lupin, struggling to free himself, "what
does this mean? When one of us has conquered the other, what good
will it do? You will not know what to do with me, nor I with you.
We will remain here like two idiots."</p>

<p>The two oars slipped into the water. The boat drifted into the
stream.</p>

<p>"Good Lord, what a fuss you make! A man of your age ought to
know better! You act like a child."</p>

<p>Lupin succeeded in freeing himself from the grasp of the
detective, who, thoroughly exasperated and ready to kill, put his
hand in his pocket. He uttered an oath: Lupin had taken his
revolver. Then he knelt down and tried to capture one of the lost
oars in order to regain the shore, while Lupin was trying to
capture the other oar in order to drive the boat down the
river.</p>

<p>"It's gone! I can't reach it," said Lupin. "But it's of no
consequence. If you get your oar I can prevent your using it. And
you could do the same to me. But, you see, that is the way in this
world, we act without any purpose or reason, as our efforts are in
vain since Fate decides everything. Now, don't you see, Fate is on
the side of his friend Lupin. The game is mine! The current favors
me!"</p>

<p>The boat was slowly drifting down the river.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Lupin, quickly.</p>

<p>Someone on the bank was pointing a revolver. Lupin stooped, a
shot was fired; it struck the water beyond the boat. Lupin burst
into laughter.</p>

<p>"God bless me! It's my friend Ganimard! But it was very wrong of
you to do that, Ganimard. You have no right to shoot except in
self-defense. Does poor Lupin worry you so much that you forget
yourself?...Now, be good, and don't shoot again!...If you do you
will hit our English friend."</p>

<p>He stood behind Sholmes, facing Ganimard, and said:</p>

<p>"Now, Ganimard, I am ready! Aim for his heart!...Higher!...A
little to the left...Ah! you missed that time...deuced bad
shot...Try again...Your hand shakes, Ganimard...Now, once
more...one, two, three, fire!...Missed!...<i>Parbleu!</i> the
authorities furnish you with toy-pistols."</p>

<p>Lupin drew a long revolver and fired without taking aim.
Ganimard put his hand to his hat: the bullet had passed through
it.</p>

<p>"What do you think of that, Ganimard! Ah! that's a real
revolver! A genuine English bulldog. It belongs to my friend,
Herlock Sholmes."</p>

<p>And, with a laugh, he threw the revolver to the shore, where it
landed at Ganimard's feet.</p>

<p>Sholmes could not withhold a smile of admiration. What a torrent
of youthful spirits! And how he seemed to enjoy himself! It
appeared as if the sensation of peril caused him a physical
pleasure; and this extraordinary man had no other purpose in life
than to seek for dangers simply for the amusement it afforded him
in avoiding them.</p>

<p>Many people had now gathered on the banks of the river, and
Ganimard and his men followed the boat as it slowly floated down
the stream. Lupin's capture was a mathematical certainty.</p>

<p>"Confess, old fellow," said Lupin, turning to the Englishman,
"that you would not exchange your present position for all the gold
in the Transvaal! You are now in the first row of the orchestra
chairs! But, in the first place, we must have the prologue...after
which we can leap, at one bound, to the fifth act of the drama,
which will represent the capture or escape of Arsène Lupin.
Therefore, I am going to ask you a plain question, to which I
request a plain answer&mdash;a simple yes or no. Will you renounce
this affair? At present I can repair the damage you have done;
later it will be beyond my power. Is it a bargain?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Lupin's face showed his disappointment and annoyance. He
continued:</p>

<p>"I insist. More for your sake than my own, I insist, because I
am certain you will be the first to regret your intervention. For
the last time, yes or no?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Lupin stooped down, removed one of the boards in the bottom of
the boat, and, for some minutes, was engaged in a work the nature
of which Sholmes could not discern. Then he arose, seated himself
beside the Englishman, and said:</p>

<p>"I believe, monsieur, that we came to the river today for the
same purpose: to recover the object which Bresson threw away. For
my part I had invited a few friends to join me here, and I was on
the point of making an examination of the bed of the river when my
friends announced your approach. I confess that the news did not
surprise me, as I have been notified every hour concerning the
progress of your investigation. That was an easy matter. Whenever
anything occurred in the rue Murillo that might interest me, simply
a ring on the telephone and I was informed."</p>

<p>He stopped. The board that he had displaced in the bottom of the
boat was rising and water was working into the boat all around
it.</p>

<p>"The deuce! I didn't know how to fix it. I was afraid this old
boat would leak. You are not afraid, monsieur?"</p>

<p>Sholmes shrugged his shoulders. Lupin continued:</p>

<p>"You will understand then, in those circumstances, and knowing
in advance that you would be more eager to seek a battle than I
would be to avoid it, I assure you I was not entirely displeased to
enter into a contest of which the issue is quite certain, since I
hold all the trump cards in my hand. And I desired that our meeting
should be given the widest publicity in order that your defeat may
be universally known, so that another Countess de Crozon or another
Baron d'Imblevalle may not be tempted to solicit your aid against
me. Besides, my dear monsieur&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped again and, using his half-closed hands as a
lorgnette, he scanned the banks of the river.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> they have chartered a superb boat, a real
war-vessel, and see how they are rowing. In five minutes they will
be alongside, and I am lost. Monsieur Sholmes, a word of advice;
you seize me, bind me and deliver me to the officers of the law.
Does that programme please you?...Unless, in the meantime, we are
shipwrecked, in which event we can do nothing but prepare our
wills. What do you think?"</p>

<p>They exchanged looks. Sholmes now understood Lupin's scheme: he
had scuttled the boat. And the water was rising. It had reached the
soles of their boots. Then it covered their feet; but they did not
move. It was halfway to their knees. The Englishman took out his
tobacco, rolled a cigarette, and lighted it. Lupin continued to
talk:</p>

<p>"But do not regard that offer as a confession of my weakness. I
surrender to you in a battle in which I can achieve a victory in
order to avoid a struggle upon a field not of my own choosing. In
so doing I recognize the fact that Sholmes is the only enemy I
fear, and announce my anxiety that Sholmes will not be diverted
from my track. I take this opportunity to tell you these things
since fate has accorded me the honor of a conversation with you. I
have only one regret; it is that our conversation should have
occurred while we are taking a foot-bath...a situation that is
lacking in dignity, I must confess...What did I say? A foot-bath?
It is worse than that."</p>

<p>The water had reached the board on which they were sitting, and
the boat was gradually sinking.</p>

<p>Sholmes, smoking his cigarette, appeared to be calmly admiring
the scenery. For nothing in the world, while face to face with that
man who, while threatened by dangers, surrounded by a crowd,
followed by a posse of police, maintained his equanimity and good
humor, for nothing in the world would he, Sholmes, display the
slightest sign of nervousness.</p>

<p>Each of them looked as if he might say: Should a person be
disturbed by such trifles? Are not people drowned in a river every
day? Is it such an unusual event as to deserve special attention?
One chatted, whilst the other dreamed; both concealing their
wounded pride beneath a mask of indifference.</p>

<p>One minute more and the boat will sink. Lupin continued his
chatter:</p>

<p>"The important thing to know is whether we will sink before or
after the arrival of the champions of the law. That is the main
question. As to our shipwreck, that is a foregone conclusion. Now,
monsieur, the hour has come in which we must make our wills. I
give, devise and bequeath all my property to Herlock Sholmes, a
citizen of England, for his own use and benefit. But, <i>mon
Dieu</i>, how quickly the champions of the law are approaching! Ah!
the brave fellows! It is a pleasure to watch them. Observe the
precision of the oars! Ah! is it you, Brigadier Folenfant? Bravo!
The idea of a war-vessel is an excellent one. I commend you to your
superiors, Brigadier Folenfant...Do you wish a medal? You shall
have it. And your comrade Dieuzy, where is he?...Ah! yes, I think I
see him on the left bank of the river at the head of a hundred
natives. So that, if I escape shipwreck, I shall be captured on the
left by Dieuzy and his natives, or, on the right, by Ganimard and
the populace of Neuilly. An embarrassing dilemma!"</p>

<p>The boat entered an eddy; it swung around and Sholmes caught
hold of the oarlocks. Lupin said to him:</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you should remove your coat. You will find it easier
to swim without a coat. No? You refuse? Then I shall put on my
own."</p>

<p>He donned his coat, buttoned it closely, the same as Sholmes,
and said:</p>

<p>"What a discourteous man you are! And what a pity that you
should be so stubborn in this affair, in which, of course, you
display your strength, but, oh! so vainly! really, you mar your
genius&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin," interrupted Sholmes, emerging from his
silence, "you talk too much, and you frequently err through excess
of confidence and through your frivolity."</p>

<p>"That is a severe reproach."</p>

<p>"Thus, without knowing it, you furnished me, only a moment ago,
with the information I required."</p>

<p>"What! you required some information and you didn't tell
me?"</p>

<p>"I had no occasion to ask you for it&mdash;you volunteered it.
Within three hours I can deliver the key of the mystery to Monsieur
d'Imblevalle. That is the only reply&mdash;"</p>

<p>He did not finish the sentence. The boat suddenly sank, taking
both of the men down with it. It emerged immediately, with its keel
in the air. Shouts were heard on either bank, succeeded by an
anxious moment of silence. Then the shouts were renewed: one of the
shipwrecked party had come to the surface.</p>

<p>It was Herlock Sholmes. He was an excellent swimmer, and struck
out, with powerful strokes, for Folenfant's boat.</p>

<p>"Courage, Monsieur Sholmes," shouted Folenfant; "we are here.
Keep it up...we will get you...a little more, Monsieur
Sholmes...catch the rope."</p>

<p>The Englishman seized the rope they had thrown to him. But,
while they were hauling him into the boat, he heard a voice behind
him, saying:</p>

<p>"The key of the mystery, monsieur, yes, you shall have it. I am
astonished that you haven't got it already. What then? What good
will it do you? By that time you will have lost the battle..."</p>

<p>Now comfortably installed astride the keel of the boat, Lupin
continued his speech with solemn gestures, as if he hoped to
convince his adversary.</p>

<p>"You must understand, my dear Sholmes, there is nothing to be
done, absolutely nothing. You find yourself in the deplorable
position of a gentleman&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surrender, Lupin!" shouted Folenfant.</p>

<p>"You are an ill-bred fellow, Folenfant, to interrupt me in the
middle of a sentence. I was saying&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Surrender, Lupin!"</p>

<p>"Oh! <i>parbleu!</i> Brigadier Folenfant, a man surrenders only
when he is in danger. Surely, you do not pretend to say that I am
in any danger."</p>

<p>"For the last time, Lupin, I call on you to surrender."</p>

<p>"Brigadier Folenfant, you have no intention of killing me; you
may wish to wound me since you are afraid I may escape. But if by
chance the wound prove mortal? Just think of your remorse! It would
embitter your old age."</p>

<p>The shot was fired.</p>

<p>Lupin staggered, clutched at the keel of the boat for a moment,
then let go and disappeared.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>It was exactly three o'clock when the foregoing events
transpired. Precisely at six o'clock, as he had foretold, Herlock
Sholmes, dressed in trousers that were too short and a coat that
was too small, which he had borrowed from an innkeeper at Neuilly,
wearing a cap and a flannel shirt, entered the boudoir in the Rue
Murillo, after having sent word to Monsieur and Madame d'Imblevalle
that he desired an interview.</p>

<p>They found him walking up and down the room. And he looked so
ludicrous in his strange costume that they could scarcely suppress
their mirth. With pensive air and stooped shoulders, he walked like
an automaton from the window to the door and from the door to the
window, taking each time the same number of steps, and turning each
time in the same manner.</p>

<p>He stopped, picked up a small ornament, examined it
mechanically, and resumed his walk. At last, planting himself
before them, he asked:</p>

<p>"Is Mademoiselle here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is in the garden with the children."</p>

<p>"I wish Mademoiselle to be present at this interview."</p>

<p>"Is it necessary&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have a little patience, monsieur. From the facts I am going to
present to you, you will see the necessity for her presence
here."</p>

<p>"Very well. Suzanne, will you call her?"</p>

<p>Madame d'Imblevalle arose, went out, and returned almost
immediately, accompanied by Alice Demun. Mademoiselle, who was a
trifle paler than usual, remained standing, leaning against a
table, and without even asking why she had been called. Sholmes did
not look at her, but, suddenly turning toward Monsieur
d'Imblevalle, he said, in a tone which did not admit of a
reply:</p>

<p>"After several days' investigation, monsieur, I must repeat what
I told you when I first came here: the Jewish lamp was stolen by
someone living in the house."</p>

<p>"The name of the guilty party?"</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Your proof?"</p>

<p>"I have sufficient to establish that fact."</p>

<p>"But we require more than that. We desire the restoration of the
stolen goods."</p>

<p>"The Jewish lamp? It is in my possession."</p>

<p>"The opal necklace? The snuffbox?"</p>

<p>"The opal necklace, the snuffbox, and all the goods stolen on
the second occasion are in my possession."</p>

<p>Sholmes delighted in these dramatic dialogues, and it pleased
him to announce his victories in that curt manner. The baron and
his wife were amazed, and looked at Sholmes with a silent
curiosity, which was the highest praise.</p>

<p>He related to them, very minutely, what he had done during those
three days. He told of his discovery of the alphabet book, wrote
upon a sheet of paper the sentence formed by the missing letters,
then related the journey of Bresson to the bank of the river and
the suicide of the adventurer, and, finally, his struggle with
Lupin, the shipwreck, and the disappearance of Lupin. When he had
finished, the baron said, in a low voice:</p>

<p>"Now, you have told us everything except the name of the guilty
party. Whom do you accuse?"</p>

<p>"I accuse the person who cut the letters from the alphabet book,
and communicated with Arsène Lupin by means of those letters."</p>

<p>"How do you know that such correspondence was carried on with
Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"My information comes from Lupin himself."</p>

<p>He produced a piece of paper that was wet and crumpled. It was
the page which Lupin had torn from his memorandum-book, and upon
which he had written the phrase.</p>

<p>"And you will notice," said Sholmes, with satisfaction, "that he
was not obliged to give me that sheet of paper, and, in that way,
disclose his identity. Simple childishness on his part, and yet it
gave me exactly the information I desired."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked the baron. "I don't understand."</p>

<p>Sholmes took a pencil and made a fresh copy of the letters and
figures.</p>

<p class="cp">"CDEHNOPRZEO&mdash;237."</p>

<p>"Well?" said the baron; "it is the formula you showed me
yourself."</p>

<p>"No. If you had turned and returned that formula in every way,
as I have done, you would have seen at first glance that this
formula is not like the first one."</p>

<p>"In what respect do they differ?"</p>

<p>"This one has two more letters&mdash;an E and an O."</p>

<p>"Really; I hadn't noticed that."</p>

<p>"Join those two letters to the C and the H which remained after
forming the word <i>respondez</i>, and you will agree with me that
the only possible word is ECHO."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?"</p>

<p>"It refers to the <i>Echo de France</i>, Lupin's newspaper, his
official organ, the one in which he publishes his communications.
Reply in the <i>Echo de France</i>, in the personal advertisements,
under number 237. That is the key to the mystery, and Arsène Lupin
was kind enough to furnish it to me. I went to the newspaper
office."</p>

<p>"What did you find there?"</p>

<p>"I found the entire story of the relations between Arsène Lupin
and his accomplice."</p>

<p>Sholmes produced seven newspapers which he opened at the fourth
page and pointed to the following lines:</p>

<p class="newspaper">1. Ars. Lup. Lady implores protection.
540.<br>
2. 540. Awaiting particulars. A. L.<br>
3. A. L. Under domin. enemy. Lost.<br>
4. 540. Write address. Will make investigation.<br>
5. A. L. Murillo.<br>
6. 540. Park three o'clock. Violets.<br>
7. 237. Understand. Sat. Will be Sun. morn. park.</p>

<p>"And you call that the whole story!" exclaimed the baron.</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you will listen to me for a few minutes, I think I
can convince you. In the first place, a lady who signs herself 540
implores the protection of Arsène Lupin, who replies by asking for
particulars. The lady replies that she is under the domination of
an enemy&mdash;who is Bresson, no doubt&mdash;and that she is lost
if someone does not come to her assistance. Lupin is suspicious and
does not yet venture to appoint an interview with the unknown
woman, demands the address and proposes to make an investigation.
The lady hesitates for four days&mdash;look at the
dates&mdash;finally, under stress of circumstances and influenced
by Bresson's threats, she gives the name of the
street&mdash;Murillo. Next day, Arsène Lupin announces that he will
be in the Park Monceau at three o'clock, and asks his unknown
correspondent to wear a bouquet of violets as a means of
identification. Then there is a lapse of eight days in the
correspondence. Arsène Lupin and the lady do not require to
correspond through the newspaper now, as they see each other or
write directly. The scheme is arranged in this way: in order to
satisfy Bresson's demands, the lady is to carry off the Jewish
lamp. The date is not yet fixed. The lady who, as a matter of
prudence, corresponds by means of letters cut out of a book,
decides on Saturday and adds: <i>Reply Echo 237</i>. Lupin replies
that it is understood and that he will be in the park on Sunday
morning. Sunday morning, the theft takes place."</p>

<p>"Really, that is an excellent chain of circumstantial evidence
and every link is complete," said the baron.</p>

<p>"The theft has taken place," continued Sholmes. "The lady goes
out on Sunday morning, tells Lupin what she has done, and carries
the Jewish lamp to Bresson. Everything occurs then exactly as Lupin
had foreseen. The officers of the law, deceived by an open window,
four holes in the ground and two scratches on the balcony railing,
immediately advance the theory that the theft was committed by a
burglar. The lady is safe."</p>

<p>"Yes, I confess the theory was a logical one," said the baron.
"But the second theft&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The second theft was provoked by the first. The newspapers
having related how the Jewish lamp had disappeared, someone
conceived the idea of repeating the crime and carrying away what
had been left. This time, it was not a simulated theft, but a real
one, a genuine burglary, with ladders and other
paraphernalia&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lupin, of course&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No. Lupin does not act so stupidly. He doesn't fire at people
for trifling reasons."</p>

<p>"Then, who was it?"</p>

<p>"Bresson, no doubt, and unknown to the lady whom he had menaced.
It was Bresson who entered here; it was Bresson that I pursued; it
was Bresson who wounded poor Wilson."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of it?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. One of Bresson's accomplices wrote to him
yesterday, before his suicide, a letter which proves that
negotiations were pending between this accomplice and Lupin for the
restitution of all the articles stolen from your house. Lupin
demanded everything, '<i>the first thing</i> (that is, the Jewish
lamp) <i>as well as those of the second affair</i>.' Moreover, he
was watching Bresson. When the latter returned from the river last
night, one of Lupin's men followed him as well as we."</p>

<p>"What was Bresson doing at the river?"</p>

<p>"Having been warned of the progress of my
investigations&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Warned! by whom?"</p>

<p>"By the same lady, who justly feared that the discovery of the
Jewish lamp would lead to the discovery of her own adventure.
Thereupon, Bresson, having been warned, made into a package all the
things that could compromise him and threw them into a place where
he thought he could get them again when the danger was past. It was
after his return, tracked by Ganimard and myself, having, no doubt,
other sins on his conscience, that he lost his head and killed
himself."</p>

<p>"But what did the package contain?"</p>

<p>"The Jewish lamp and your other ornaments."</p>

<p>"Then, they are not in your possession?"</p>

<p>"Immediately after Lupin's disappearance, I profited by the bath
he had forced upon me, went to the spot selected by Bresson, where
I found the stolen articles wrapped in some soiled linen. They are
there, on the table."</p>

<p>Without a word, the baron cut the cord, tore open the wet linen,
picked out the lamp, turned a screw in the foot, then divided the
bowl of the lamp which opened in two equal parts and there he found
the golden chimera, set with rubies and emeralds.</p>

<p>It was intact.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>There was in that scene, so natural in appearance and which
consisted of a simple exposition of facts, something which rendered
it frightfully tragic&mdash;it was the formal, direct, irrefutable
accusation that Sholmes launched in each of his words against
Mademoiselle. And it was also the impressive silence of Alice
Demun.</p>

<p>During that long, cruel accumulation of accusing circumstances
heaped one upon another, not a muscle of her face had moved, not a
trace of revolt or fear had marred the serenity of her limpid eyes.
What were her thoughts. And, especially, what was she going to say
at the solemn moment when it would become necessary for her to
speak and defend herself in order to break the chain of evidence
that Herlock Sholmes had so cleverly woven around her?</p>

<p>That moment had come, but the girl was silent.</p>

<p>"Speak! Speak!" cried Mon. d'Imblevalle.</p>

<p>She did not speak. So he insisted:</p>

<p>"One word will clear you. One word of denial, and I will believe
you."</p>

<p>That word, she would not utter.</p>

<p>The baron paced to and fro in his excitement; then, addressing
Sholmes, he said:</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, I cannot believe it, I do not believe it. There
are impossible crimes! and this is opposed to all I know and to all
that I have seen during the past year. No, I cannot believe
it."</p>

<p>He placed his hand on the Englishman's shoulder, and said:</p>

<p>"But you yourself, monsieur, are you absolutely certain that you
are right?"</p>

<p>Sholmes hesitated, like a man on whom a sudden demand is made
and cannot frame an immediate reply. Then he smiled, and said:</p>

<p>"Only the person whom I accuse, by reason of her situation in
your house, could know that the Jewish lamp contained that
magnificent jewel."</p>

<p>"I cannot believe it," repeated the baron.</p>

<p>"Ask her."</p>

<p>It was, really, the very thing he would not have done, blinded
by the confidence the girl had inspired in him. But he could no
longer refrain from doing it. He approached her and, looking into
her eyes, said:</p>

<p>"Was it you, mademoiselle? Was it you who took the jewel? Was it
you who corresponded with Arsène Lupin and committed the
theft?"</p>

<p>"It was I, monsieur," she replied.</p>

<p>She did not drop her head. Her face displayed no sign of shame
or fear.</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" murmured Mon. d'Imblevalle. "I would never
have believed it...You are the last person in the world that I
would have suspected. How did you do it?"</p>

<p>"I did it exactly as Monsieur Sholmes has told it. On Saturday
night I came to the boudoir, took the lamp, and, in the morning I
carried it...to that man."</p>

<p>"No," said the baron; "what you pretend to have done is
impossible."</p>

<p>"Impossible&mdash;why?"</p>

<p>"Because, in the morning I found the door of the boudoir
bolted."</p>

<p>She blushed, and looked at Sholmes as if seeking his counsel.
Sholmes was astonished at her embarrassment. Had she nothing to
say? Did the confessions, which had corroborated the report that
he, Sholmes, had made concerning the theft of the Jewish lamp,
merely serve to mask a lie? Was she misleading them by a false
confession?</p>

<p>The baron continued:</p>

<p>"That door was locked. I found the door exactly as I had left it
the night before. If you entered by that door, as you pretend,
someone must have opened it from the interior&mdash;that is to say,
from the boudoir or from our chamber. Now, there was no one inside
these two rooms...there was no one except my wife and myself."</p>

<p>Sholmes bowed his head and covered his face with his hands in
order to conceal his emotion. A sudden light had entered his mind,
that startled him and made him exceedingly uncomfortable.
Everything was revealed to him, like the sudden lifting of a fog
from the morning landscape. He was annoyed as well as ashamed,
because his deductions were fallacious and his entire theory was
wrong.</p>

<p>Alice Demun was innocent!</p>

<p>Alice Demun was innocent. That proposition explained the
embarrassment he had experienced from the beginning in directing
the terrible accusation against that young girl. Now, he saw the
truth; he knew it. After a few seconds, he raised his head, and
looked at Madame d'Imblevalle as naturally as he could. She was
pale&mdash;with that unusual pallor which invades us in the
relentless moments of our lives. Her hands, which she endeavored to
conceal, were trembling as if stricken with palsy.</p>

<p>"One minute more," thought Sholmes, "and she will betray
herself."</p>

<p>He placed himself between her and her husband in the desire to
avert the awful danger which, through his fault, now threatened
that man and woman. But, at sight of the baron, he was shocked to
the very centre of his soul. The same dreadful idea had entered the
mind of Monsieur d'Imblevalle. The same thought was at work in the
brain of the husband. He understood, also! He saw the truth!</p>

<p>In desperation, Alice Demun hurled herself against the
implacable truth, saying:</p>

<p>"You are right, monsieur. I made a mistake. I did not enter by
this door. I came through the garden and the vestibule...by aid of
a ladder&mdash;"</p>

<p>It was a supreme effort of true devotion. But a useless effort!
The words rang false. The voice did not carry conviction, and the
poor girl no longer displayed those clear, fearless eyes and that
natural air of innocence which had served her so well. Now, she
bowed her head&mdash;vanquished.</p>

<p>The silence became painful. Madame d'Imblevalle was waiting for
her husband's next move, overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. The
baron appeared to be struggling against the dreadful suspicion, as
if he would not submit to the overthrow of his happiness. Finally,
he said to his wife:</p>

<p>"Speak! Explain!"</p>

<p>"I have nothing to tell you," she replied, in a very low voice,
and with features drawn by anguish.</p>

<p>"So, then...Mademoiselle..."</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle saved me...through devotion...through
affection...and accused herself..."</p>

<p>"Saved you from what? From whom?"</p>

<p>"From that man."</p>

<p>"Bresson?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it was I whom he held in fear by threats...I met him at
one of my friends'...and I was foolish enough to listen to him. Oh!
there was nothing that you cannot pardon. But I wrote him two
letters...letters which you will see...I had to buy them
back...you know how...Oh! have pity on me!...I have suffered so
much!"</p>

<p>"You! You! Suzanne!"</p>

<p>He raised his clenched fists, ready to strike her, ready to kill
her. But he dropped his arms, and murmured:</p>

<p>"You, Suzanne...You!...Is it possible?"</p>

<p>By short detached sentences, she related the heartrending story,
her dreadful awakening to the infamy of the man, her remorse, her
fear, and she also told of Alice's devotion; how the young girl
divined the sorrow of her mistress, wormed a confession out of her,
wrote to Lupin, and devised the scheme of the theft in order to
save her from Bresson.</p>

<p>"You, Suzanne, you," repeated Monsieur d'Imblevalle, bowed with
grief and shame..."How could you?"</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>On the same evening, the steamer <i>City of London</i>, which
plies between Calais and Dover, was gliding slowly over the smooth
sea. The night was dark; the wind was fainter than a zephyr. The
majority of the passengers had retired to their cabins; but a few,
more intrepid, were promenading on the deck or sleeping in large
rocking-chairs, wrapped in their travelling-rugs. One could see,
here and there, the light of a cigar, and one could hear, mingled
with the soft murmur of the breeze, the faint sound of voices which
were carefully subdued to harmonize with the deep silence of the
night.</p>

<p>One of the passengers, who had been pacing to and fro upon the
deck, stopped before a woman who was lying on a bench, scrutinized
her, and, when she moved a little, he said:</p>

<p>"I thought you were asleep, Mademoiselle Alice."</p>

<p>"No, Monsieur Sholmes, I am not sleepy. I was thinking."</p>

<p>"Of what? If I may be so bold as to inquire?"</p>

<p>"I was thinking of Madame d'Imblevalle. She must be very
unhappy. Her life is ruined."</p>

<p>"Oh! no, no," he replied quickly. "Her mistake was not a serious
one. Monsieur d'Imblevalle will forgive and forget it. Why, even
before we left, his manner toward her had softened."</p>

<p>"Perhaps...but he will remember it for a long time...and she
will suffer a great deal."</p>

<p>"You love her?"</p>

<p>"Very much. It was my love for her that gave me strength to
smile when I was trembling from fear, that gave me courage to look
in your face when I desired to hide from your sight."</p>

<p>"And you are sorry to leave her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, very sorry. I have no relatives, no friends&mdash;but
her."</p>

<p>"You will have friends," said the Englishman, who was affected
by her sorrow. "I have promised that. I have relatives...and some
influence. I assure you that you will have no cause to regret
coming to England."</p>

<p>"That may be, monsieur, but Madame d'Imblevalle will not be
there."</p>

<p>Herlock Sholmes resumed his promenade upon the deck. After a few
minutes, he took a seat near his travelling companion, filled his
pipe, and struck four matches in a vain effort to light it. Then,
as he had no more matches, he arose and said to a gentleman who was
sitting near him:</p>

<p>"May I trouble you for a match?"</p>

<p>The gentleman opened a box of matches and struck one. The flame
lighted up his face. Sholmes recognized him&mdash;it was Arsène
Lupin.</p>

<p>If the Englishman had not given an almost imperceptible movement
of surprise, Lupin would have supposed that his presence on board
had been known to Sholmes, so well did he control his feelings and
so natural was the easy manner in which he extended his hand to his
adversary.</p>

<p>"How's the good health, Monsieur Lupin?"</p>

<p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Lupin, who could not repress a cry of
admiration at the Englishman's sangfroid.</p>

<p>"Bravo? and why?"</p>

<p>"Why? Because I appear before you like a ghost, only a few hours
after you saw me drowned in the Seine; and through pride&mdash;a
quality that is essentially English&mdash;you evince not the
slightest surprise. You greet me as a matter of course. Ah! I
repeat: Bravo! Admirable!"</p>

<p>"There is nothing remarkable about it. From the manner in which
you fell from the boat, I knew very well that you fell voluntarily,
and that the bullet had not touched you."</p>

<p>"And you went away without knowing what had become of me?"</p>

<p>"What had become of you? Why, I knew that. There were at least
five hundred people on the two banks of the river within a space of
half-a-mile. If you escaped death, your capture was certain."</p>

<p>"And yet I am here."</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lupin, there are two men in the world at whom I am
never astonished: in the first place, myself&mdash;and then, Arsène
Lupin."</p>

<p>The treaty of peace was concluded.</p>

<p>If Sholmes had not been successful in his contests with Arsène
Lupin; if Lupin remained the only enemy whose capture he must never
hope to accomplish; if, in the course of their struggles, he had
not always displayed a superiority, the Englishman had, none the
less, by means of his extraordinary intuition and tenacity,
succeeded in recovering the Jewish lamp as well as the blue
diamond.</p>

<p>This time, perhaps, the finish had not been so brilliant,
especially from the standpoint of the public spectators, since
Sholmes was obliged to maintain a discreet silence in regard to the
circumstances in which the Jewish lamp had been recovered, and to
announce that he did not know the name of the thief. But as man to
man, Arsène Lupin against Herlock Sholmes, detective against
burglar, there was neither victor nor vanquished. Each of them had
won corresponding victories.</p>

<p>Therefore they could now converse as courteous adversaries who
had lain down their arms and held each other in high regard.</p>

<p>At Sholmes' request, Arsène Lupin related the strange story of
his escape.</p>

<p>"If I may dignify it by calling it an escape," he said. "It was
so simple! My friends were watching for me, as I had asked them to
meet me there to recover the Jewish lamp. So, after remaining a
good half-hour under the overturned boat, I took advantage of an
occasion when Folenfant and his men were searching for my dead body
along the bank of the river, to climb on top of the boat. Then my
friends simply picked me up as they passed by in their motorboat,
and we sailed away under the staring eyes of an astonished
multitude, including Ganimard and Folenfant."</p>

<p>"Very good," exclaimed Sholmes, "very neatly played. And now you
have some business in England?"</p>

<p>"Yes, some accounts to square up...But I forgot...what about
Monsieur d'Imblevalle?"</p>

<p>"He knows everything."</p>

<p>"All! my dear Sholmes, what did I tell you? The wrong is now
irreparable. Would it not have been better to have allowed me to
carry out the affair in my own way? In a day or two more, I should
have recovered the stolen goods from Bresson, restored them to
Monsieur d'Imblevalle, and those two honest citizens would have
lived together in peace and happiness ever after. Instead of
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Instead of that," said Sholmes, sneeringly, "I have mixed the
cards and sown the seeds of discord in the bosom of a family that
was under your protection."</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu!</i> of course, I was protecting them. Must a
person steal, cheat and wrong all the time?"</p>

<p>"Then you do good, also?"</p>

<p>"When I have the time. Besides, I find it amusing. Now, for
instance, in our last adventure, I found it extremely diverting
that I should be the good genius seeking to help and save
unfortunate mortals, while you were the evil genius who dispensed
only despair and tears."</p>

<p>"Tears! Tears!" protested Sholmes.</p>

<p>"Certainly! The d'Imblevalle household is demolished, and Alice
Demun weeps."</p>

<p>"She could not remain any longer. Ganimard would have discovered
her some day, and, through her, reached Madame d'Imblevalle."</p>

<p>"Quite right, monsieur; but whose fault is it?"</p>

<p>Two men passed by. Sholmes said to Lupin, in a friendly
tone:</p>

<p>"Do you know those gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"I thought I recognized one of them as the captain of the
steamer."</p>

<p>"And the other?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"It is Austin Gilett, who occupies in London a position similar
to that of Monsieur Dudouis in Paris."</p>

<p>"Ah! how fortunate! Will you be so kind as to introduce me?
Monsieur Dudouis is one of my best friends, and I shall be
delighted to say as much of Monsieur Austin Gilett."</p>

<p>The two gentlemen passed again.</p>

<p>"And if I should take you at your word, Monsieur Lupin?" said
Sholmes, rising, and seizing Lupin's wrist with a hand of iron.</p>

<p>"Why do you grasp me so tightly, monsieur? I am quite willing to
follow you."</p>

<p>In fact, he allowed himself to be dragged along without the
least resistance. The two gentlemen were disappearing from sight.
Sholmes quickened his pace. His fingernails even sank into Lupin's
flesh.</p>

<p>"Come! Come!" he exclaimed, with a sort of feverish haste, in
harmony with his action. "Come! quicker than that."</p>

<p>But he stopped suddenly. Alice Demun was following them.</p>

<p>"What are you doing, Mademoiselle? You need not come. You must
not come!"</p>

<p>It was Lupin who replied:</p>

<p>"You will notice, monsieur, that she is not coming of her own
free will. I am holding her wrist in the same tight grasp that you
have on mine."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I wish to present her also. Her part in the affair of
the Jewish lamp is much more important than mine. Accomplice of
Arsène Lupin, accomplice of Bresson, she has a right to tell her
adventure with the Baroness d'Imblevalle&mdash;which will deeply
interest Monsieur Gilett as an officer of the law. And by
introducing her also, you will have carried your gracious
intervention to the very limit, my dear Sholmes."</p>

<p>The Englishman released his hold on his prisoner's wrist. Lupin
liberated Mademoiselle.</p>

<p>They stood looking at each other for a few seconds, silently and
motionless. Then Sholmes returned to the bench and sat down,
followed by Lupin and the girl. After a long silence, Lupin said:
"You see, monsieur, whatever we may do, we will never be on the
same side. You are on one side of the fence; I am on the other. We
can exchange greetings, shake hands, converse a moment, but the
fence is always there. You will remain Herlock Sholmes, detective,
and I, Arsène Lupin, gentleman-burglar. And Herlock Sholmes will
ever obey, more or less spontaneously, with more or less propriety,
his instinct as a detective, which is to pursue the burglar and run
him down, if possible. And Arsène Lupin, in obedience to his
burglarious instinct, will always be occupied in avoiding the reach
of the detective, and making sport of the detective, if he can do
it. And, this time, he can do it. Ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>He burst into a loud laugh, cunning, cruel and odious.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly becoming serious, he addressed Alice Demun:</p>

<p>"You may be sure, mademoiselle, even when reduced to the last
extremity, I shall not betray you. Arsène Lupin never betrays
anyone&mdash;especially those whom he loves and admires. And, may I
be permitted to say, I love and admire the brave, dear woman you
have proved yourself to be."</p>

<p>He took from his pocket a visiting card, tore it in two, gave
one-half of it to the girl, as he said, in a voice shaken with
emotion:</p>

<p>"If Monsieur Sholmes' plans for you do not succeed,
mademoiselle, go to Lady Strongborough&mdash;you can easily find
her address&mdash;and give her that half of the card, and, at the
same time, say to her: Faithful friend. Lady Strongborough will
show you the true devotion of a sister."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said the girl; "I shall see her tomorrow."</p>

<p>"And now, Monsieur Sholmes," exclaimed Lupin, with the satisfied
air of a gentleman who has fulfilled his duty, "I will say good
night. We will not land for an hour yet, so I will get that much
rest."</p>

<p>He lay down on the bench, with his hands beneath his head.</p>

<p>In a short time the high cliffs of the English coast loomed up
in the increasing light of a newborn day. The passengers emerged
from the cabins and crowded the deck, eagerly gazing on the
approaching shore. Austin Gilette passed by, accompanied by two men
whom Sholmes recognized as sleuths from Scotland Yard.</p>

<p>Lupin was asleep, on his bench.</p>
