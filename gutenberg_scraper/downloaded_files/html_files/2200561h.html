<h2><a name="ch0" id="ch0"></a>Preface</h2>

<p>This is the story of the first adventure of Arsène Lupin, and
undoubtedly it would have been published before the stories of the
others if he had not so often and so resolutely opposed it.</p>

<p>"No," he would say, "there are one or two little matters yet to
be settled between the Countess of Cagliostro and me. We must
wait."</p>

<p>The waiting lasted longer than he foresaw. More than a quarter
of a century passed before the final settlement; and only today am
I permitted to relate the frightful duel of love and hate which
brought a boy of twenty to grips with Cagliostro's daughter.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch1" id="ch1"></a>1. Arsène Lupin at Twenty</h2>

<p>Ralph d'Andresy extinguished the lamp, and thrust his bicycle
behind a bank. At that moment the clock of Benouville struck
three.</p>

<p>In the deep shadow of the night he followed the lane which led
to the estate of La Haie d'Etigues and so came to the wall which
ran round it. He waited a little&mdash;the sound of horses pawing
the ground, of wheels which rang on the pavement of the courtyard,
the sound of harness bells. Then the two leaves of the big door
were thrown open and a carriage passed out. It passed so quickly
that Ralph barely caught the sound of men's voices and perceived
the barrel of gun before the vehicle reached the highroad and took
the way to Etretat.</p>

<p>"Come," said he. "Shooting gulls is an attractive sport and the
rock where they shoot them is a long way off. At last I'm going to
know the meaning of this improvised shooting-party and of all these
odd comings and goings."</p>

<p>He took his way along the boundary wall to the left, turned a
corner and then another, and stopped forty yards along the wall. In
his hand he held two keys. The first of them opened a small, low
door. He went through it up a staircase hollowed out of the wall,
half fallen to ruin, which, running along its left wing, had formed
one of the old defences of the château. The second key opened for
him a secret door in the first floor of the château itself.</p>

<p>He lit a small bull's-eye lantern and without taking any special
precautions, since he knew that the staff of servants lived in the
other wing and that Clarice d'Etigues, the only daughter of the
Baron, had her rooms on the second floor, went down a passage which
brought him to a large study. In that very room some weeks
previously he had asked the Baron for his daughter's hand in
marriage. His proposal had been received with an explosion of
indignant anger of which he retained a most disagreeable
recollection.</p>

<p>A mirror showed him the pale face of a young man, even paler
than usual. However, inured to emotion, he remained master of
himself and coolly addressed himself to his task.</p>

<p>He was not long about it. In the course of his interview with
the Baron he had observed that that gentleman now and then cast a
glance at a large mahogany roll-top desk of which the top had not
been drawn down. Ralph knew all the places in which it is possible
to put a secret drawer and all the mechanical devices that work
such secret drawers. In a very short time he discovered in a cranny
of the desk a tiny drawer which held a letter written on very thin
paper and rolled up into the shape of a cigarette. No signature. No
address.</p>

<p>He studied this letter, which at first appeared to him too
commonplace for anyone to have taken so much trouble to hide it,
and after working on it with the most minute care, giving the most
earnest consideration to certain words which seemed significant and
ignoring certain phrases evidently intended to fill the gaps
between them, he was able to disentangle the following:</p>

<p><br>
I found at Rouen traces of our enemy and I have had published in
the local newspapers a story that a peasant in the vicinity of
Etretat has dug up in his field an old copper candlestick with
seven branches. At once she telegraphed to the livery stable at
Etretat to send, at three o'clock in the afternoon on the twelfth,
a brougham to meet her at Fécamp station.</p>

<p>On the morning of that day I will see that the livery stable
receives another telegram, countermanding this order. Therefore it
will be your brougham that she will find at Fécamp station and
which will bring her to us, under a sufficient escort, at the very
moment at which we are holding our meeting. We shall be able to
constitute ourselves a tribunal and pronounce upon her a relentless
sentence.</p>

<p>In those days in which the greatness of the end justified the
means, the punishment would have been immediate. Dead men tell no
tales. Choose what end you please; but remember the conclusions to
which we came during our last interview and bear in mind that the
success of our enterprises and our very existence itself depends on
this infernal creature.</p>

<p>Be prudent. Arrange a shooting-party to divert suspicion. I will
arrive by way of le Hâvre at four o'clock exactly, with two of our
friends. Do not destroy this letter. You will give it back to
me.</p>

<p><br>
"An excess of precaution is a mistake," thought Ralph. "If the
Baron's correspondent had not been so distrustful, the Baron would
have burnt this letter and I should not have known about this
scheme of abduction, this scheme of an illegal tribunal and even,
heaven help us! this scheme of assassination...Hang it! My future
father-in-law, devout Catholic though he may be, seems to me to be
entangled in combinations that are not Catholic at all...Will he go
as far as murder?...All this is devilishly serious and may very
well give me a hold on him."</p>

<p>He rubbed his hands. The business gave him considerable
satisfaction and excited in him no great astonishment, since for
several days he had been noticing some queer facts. He resolved
then to return to his inn and sleep there and then to come back in
good time to learn what the Baron and his guests were plotting and
who this "infernal creature" was whom they desired to suppress.</p>

<p>He rerolled the letter, cigarette-wise, carefully, and put it
back in the drawer, but, instead of departing, he sat down in front
of a small round table on which there was a photograph of Clarice,
and drawing it directly in front of him contemplated it with a
profound tenderness. Clarice d'Etigues, very little younger than he
was himself...eighteen. Voluptuous lips...eyes full of dreams...a
clear-skinned, pink, and delicate fair face, crowned by a mass of
fair hair such as the hair of those little girls who run about the
roads in the neighborhood of Caux...and such a sweet expression and
such charm!</p>

<p>Ralph's eyes grew fonder and fonder as he gazed. Thus,
naturally, the desire came to him to be with the object of his
adoration. Why not? Clarice was alone in her isolated suite of
rooms above him. Twice already, making use of the keys which she
had entrusted to him, he had made his way to them in the afternoon.
What was there to hinder him now? No sound they would make could
reach the servants. The Baron would not return till the afternoon.
Why go away? Compromise her? Why should he compromise her? No one
could possibly know that he had been with her.</p>

<p>Besides, it was such a delightful night. The moon, nearly at the
full, was shining with all its brightness. On such a night, under
an even brighter moon and clearer sky, Romeo had made love to
Juliet. He went quickly, but quietly, up the stairs.</p>

<p>Before the closed door of her boudoir he hesitated. Suppose
someone <i>should</i> learn that he had been with her? No one
could. He knocked with a rather uncertain hand. He waited. He
knocked again louder and again waited. There was a sound in the
room. The door opened, revealing Clarice, candle in hand, dressed
in a lace peignoir, her charming face enframed in the silken mass
of fair hair loosely held together by a ribbon.</p>

<p>"Ralph?" she murmured softly. "It seemed impossible. But I knew
it was you. But&mdash;you oughtn't to have come."</p>

<p>"I couldn't keep away. I wanted so to be with you. It's quite
safe. No one saw me come. No one can know I'm here," he said in
pleasing accents.</p>

<p>She smiled at him adorably and stepped back. He entered and shut
the door and turned the key. He took the candle from her, blew it
out, and set it on the table. Then, gently, he put his arms around
her, drew her to him, and kissed her eyes and her lips with long,
lingering kisses.</p>

<p>Then he drew her to a couch in front of the long, low window,
and they sank down on to it, his arm round her waist, and her arm
round his neck; and in the intervals between their languorous,
passionate kisses, they gazed down on the plain and across the sea
bathed in the silver radiance of the queen of the night.</p>

<p>They sat, murmuring to one another the lovely thoughts which
their nearness in the night evoked in their ardent souls, thrilling
and intoxicated, till the moonlight faded in the golden dawn and
the sun rose over the seat.</p>

<p><br>
They had loved one another for three months&mdash;since the day of
their meeting in the south, where Clarice was spending some time at
the home of a schoolgirl friend. Forthwith they felt themselves
united by a bond, which was for him the most delightful thing in
the world, for her the symbol of slavery which she cherished more
and more fondly. From the beginning he appeared to her to be an
extraordinarily elusive creature, mysterious, one whom she would
never understand. He grieved her by occasional moods of flippancy,
of malicious irony, of deep gloom. But in spite of that, what a
fascination he had! What a gaiety! What bursts of enthusiasm and
youthful exaltation!</p>

<p>All his faults assumed the appearance of qualities in excess;
and his vices had the air of virtues ignorant of themselves and
about to expand.</p>

<p>After her return to Normandy she was surprised one morning to
perceive the slender figure of the young man, perched on a wall in
front of her windows. He had chosen an inn a few kilometers away,
and from there, almost every day, he came on his bicycle to find
her in the neighborhood of La Haie d'Etigues.</p>

<p>A motherless girl, Clarice was not fortunate in her father, a
hard man, gloomy in character, a fanatic in religion, inordinately
proud of his title, greedy of gain to the point that the farmers
who rented his land looked upon him as an enemy.</p>

<p>When Ralph, who had not even been introduced to him, had the
audacity to ask his daughter's hand in marriage, the Baron fell
into such a fury with this beardless suitor, without a career and
without relations, that he would have horsewhipped him if the young
man had not quietly held him with something of the gaze of a tamer
of wild beasts.</p>

<p>It was in consequence of this interview and to efface the memory
of it from Ralph's spirit that Clarice had entrusted to him the two
keys which gave him secret access to her suite.</p>

<p>Later in the morning, pretending that she was not feeling well,
she had her midday déjeuner brought up to her boudoir while Ralph
hid himself in a room at the end of the corridor. After the meal
they returned to the couch in front of the window and renewed the
transports of the magical night.</p>

<p>A fresh breeze, rising from the sea and blowing across the high
ground, caressed their faces. In front of them, beyond the great
park enclosed by the wall, and among the plains all golden with the
blossom of the colza, a depression allowed them to see, on the
right, the white line of the high cliffs as far as Fécamp, on the
left Etretat Bay, Aval Harbor, and the point of the enormous
Needle.</p>

<p>A cloud fell on Clarice's spirit. The tears welled up into her
eyes.</p>

<p>He said to her gently:</p>

<p>"Don't be sad, my dearest darling. Life is so sweet at our age;
and it will be sweeter still for us when we shall have swept away
all the obstacles. Don't be sad."</p>

<p>She dried her tears and, gazing at him, tried to smile. He was
slender as was she, but broad-shouldered, of a build at once
elegant and solid. His face, full of character, displayed a
mischievous mouth and eyes shining with gaiety. Wearing
knickerbockers and an open jacket over a white woollen sweater, he
had an air of incredible suppleness.</p>

<p>"Ralph," she said in a tone of distress, "at this very moment
even while you are looking at me, you are not thinking about me!
You are not thinking about me any longer, even though you are with
me. It hardly seems possible! What are you thinking about,
darling?"</p>

<p>He laughed gently and said:</p>

<p>"About your father."</p>

<p>"About my father?"</p>

<p>"Yes: about the Baron d'Etigues and his guests. How on earth can
men of their age waste their time killing off poor innocent birds
on a rock?"</p>

<p>"It's their amusement."</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that? For my part I'm rather puzzled about the
matter. In fact, if we were not in the year of grace 1892 I should
be inclined to think rather...You're not going to feel hurt?"</p>

<p>"Go on, dear."</p>

<p>"Well, they have the air of playing at conspirators! Yes; it
really is so...the Marquis de Rolleville, Matthew de la Vaupaliere,
Count Oscar de Bennetot, Rufus d'Estiers, etc., all these noble
lords of the Caux country are up to their necks in a
conspiracy!"</p>

<p>She looked at him with incredulous eyes.</p>

<p>"You're talking nonsense, darling," she murmured.</p>

<p>"But you listen so prettily," he replied, assured of her
complete ignorance of the plot. "You have such a delightful way of
waiting for me to tell you serious things."</p>

<p>"Things about love, darling."</p>

<p>He drew her to him almost roughly.</p>

<p>"The whole of my life is nothing but love for you, darling. If I
have other cares, other ambitions, they are to win you outright.
Suppose that your father, this conspiracy discovered, is arrested
and condemned to death and all at once I save him. After that how
would he be able to refuse me his daughter's hand?"</p>

<p>"He will give way some day or other, darling."</p>

<p>"Never! I have no money...no means of support."</p>

<p>"You have your name: Ralph d'Andresy."</p>

<p>"Not even that."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"D'Andresy was my mother's name, which she took again when she
became a widow, and at the bidding of her family whom her marriage
had outraged."</p>

<p>"Why?" said Clarice somewhat dumbfounded by these unexpected
revelations.</p>

<p>"Why? Because my father was only an outsider...as poor as
Job...a simple professor...and a professor of what? Of gymnastics,
fencing, and boxing!"</p>

<p>"Then what <i>is</i> your name?"</p>

<p>"An uncommonly vulgar one."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin."</p>

<p>"Arsène Lupin?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it's hardly a brilliant name, is it? And the best thing to
do was to change it, don't you think?"</p>

<p>Clarice appeared overwhelmed. It made no difference what his
name was&mdash;to her. But in the eyes of the Baron the particle
"de" was the very first qualification of a son-in-law.</p>

<p>She murmured however:</p>

<p>"You ought not to have disowned your father. There's nothing to
be ashamed of in being a professor."</p>

<p>"Nothing to be ashamed of at all," said he, laughing cheerfully,
but with a rather hard laugh which hurt Clarice. "And I can assure
you that I've benefited to the greatest possible extent by the
lessons in boxing and gymnastics which he gave me when I was still
at the bottle. But it may be that my mother had other reasons for
denying the noble fellow. But that is nobody's business."</p>

<p>He hugged her with a sudden violence and then began to dance and
pirouette. Then coming back to her:</p>

<p>"But smile, little girl&mdash;laugh!" he exclaimed. "All this is
really very funny. So laugh. Arsène Lupin or Ralph d'Andresy, what
on earth does it matter? The main thing is to succeed. And I shall
succeed. About that there is no doubt. Every fortune-teller I have
ever come across has predicted a great future and universal renown
for me. Ralph d'Andresy will be a general, or a minister, or an
ambassador...Always supposing that he does not remain Arsène Lupin.
It is an affair settled before the throne of Destiny, agreed on,
signed by both parties. I am quite ready. Muscles of steel and a
number one brain! Come, would you like me to walk on my hands, or
carry you about at arms' length? Or would you prefer that I took
your watch without your perceiving it, or shall I recite by heart
Homer in Greek and Milton in English? Heavens, how sweet life is!
Ralph d'Andresy...Arsène Lupin. The statue with two faces! Which of
them will be illumined by glory, the sun of those who really
live?"</p>

<p>He stopped short. His lightness seemed all at once to chafe him.
Silent, he looked round the quiet little room, the security of
which he was troubling, as he had troubled the young girl's pure
and peaceful heart; and with one of those unexpected changes which
were the charm of his disposition, he knelt down before Clarice and
said to her gravely:</p>

<p>"Forgive me. I did wrong to come here...But it is not my fault.
It is so difficult for me to keep my balance...Good and evil, they
attract me in turn. You must help me, Clarice, to choose my path,
and you must forgive me if I miss my way."</p>

<p>She took his head between her hands and in passionate accents
cried:</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive you, darling. I'm happy. You will
cause me bitter suffering&mdash;I'm sure of it&mdash;and I accept
beforehand and joyfully all those sorrows you will bring upon me.
Here, take my photo, and act in such a way that you never need to
blush when you look at it. For my part, I shall always be just what
I am today&mdash;your sweetheart and your wife. I love you,
Ralph."</p>

<p>She kissed him on the brow. But even now he was again laughing;
and as he rose to his feet, he said:</p>

<p>"You have armed your knight, lady. Behold me henceforth
invincible and ready to confound my enemies. Appear, men of
Navarre!...I enter the lists!"</p>

<p><br>
Ralph's plan&mdash;let us drop the name of Arsène Lupin since at
that moment, ignorant of his destiny, he himself held it in some
contempt&mdash;Ralph's plan was very simple. In the park, on the
left of the château, and resting against the boundary wall, of
which it formerly formed one of the bastions, there was a truncated
tower, very low, roofed over, and almost hidden by waves of ivy.
Now he had no doubt that the meeting fixed for four o'clock would
take place in the great chamber inside it, where the Baron
interviewed his tenants. And Ralph had also observed that an
opening, an old window or air-hole, looked over the country.</p>

<p>The ascent to it was easy for a young man of his agility.
Leaving the château and creeping along under the ivy, he raised
himself, thanks to the huge roots, to the opening in the thick
wall. He found it deep enough to allow him to stretch himself at
full length in it. So placed, nearly twenty feet from the ground,
his head hidden by the leaves, he could not be seen, and he could
see the whole of the chamber. It was furnished with a score of
chairs, a table, and in the middle of it was set a great bench from
some church.</p>

<p>Forty minutes later the Baron entered with his friends. Ralph
had foreseen exactly what would happen.</p>

<p>The Baron Godfrey d'Etigues enjoyed the muscular development of
a strong man of the music-halls. His face was brick-red and the
lower part of it was covered with a red beard. His eyes shone with
a strongly vital intelligence. He was accompanied by his cousin,
whom Ralph knew by sight, Oscar de Bennetot, who had the same air
of the Normandy squire, but was of a commoner and duller type. Both
of them appeared to be in a state of considerable excitement.</p>

<p>The Baron walked up and down restlessly and ran over the
arrangements: "La Vaupaliere, Rolleville and d'Auppegard are on
their way to join us. At four o'clock Beaumagnan will arrive with
the Prince of Arcola and de Brie, by way of the park of which I
have left the big gate open...And then...then <i>she</i> will
arrive...if by good luck she falls into the trap."</p>

<p>"That's doubtful," murmured Bennetot.</p>

<p>"Why? She has ordered a brougham; the brougham will be there and
she will get into it. D'Ormont, who is driving it, drives her here.
At the edge of the four crossroads Rufus d'Estiers jumps on to the
step, opens the door, and overpowers the lady. The two of them
truss her up. This is bound to happen."</p>

<p>They came right under Ralph's hiding-place; so that he caught
Bennetot's murmur:</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Then I explain the situation to our friends, the part that this
woman is playing," growled the Baron.</p>

<p>"And you imagine that you will be able to get them to agree to
condemn her?"</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter whether they agree or whether they don't; the
result will be the same. Beaumagnan demands it. How can we refuse?"
said the Baron.</p>

<p>"That man will be the ruin of us," affirmed Bennetot.</p>

<p>The Baron d'Etigues shrugged his shoulders and protested:</p>

<p>"We need a man like him, to struggle against a woman like her.
Is everything ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes. The two boats are on the beach at the bottom of the
priests' staircase. The smaller is scuttled and will sink ten
minutes after it is set afloat."</p>

<p>"You have put a stone in it?" asked the Baron.</p>

<p>"Yes, a good-sized boulder with a hole in it, through which you
can run the rope."</p>

<p>They were silent, casting uneasy glances at the door of the
chamber.</p>

<p>Not one of the words they had spoken had escaped the keen ears
of Ralph d'Andresy and not one of them had failed to put a keener
edge on his already keen curiosity.</p>

<p>"Hang it all! I wouldn't give up this box on the first tier for
an Empire," he murmured. "What hot stuff they are! They talk about
murdering as other people talk about putting on a clean
collar."</p>

<p>Above all Godfrey d'Etigues astonished him. How could the gentle
Clarice be the daughter of this gloomy soul? What end was he trying
to compass? What were the dark motives on which he was acting?
Hate, greed, the lust for revenge, the instinct of cruelty? He
brought to one's mind an executioner of bygone days ready to set
about some sinister task. His brick-red face and red beard seemed
to be lit up by internal flames.</p>

<p>Then three other guests arrived together. Ralph knew them as
frequent visitors at La Haie d'Etigues. They sat down with their
backs to the two windows which lighted the chamber as if they
desired their faces to be blurred in the shadow.</p>

<p>On the very stroke of four two newcomers entered. One, a man of
considerable age and of a soldierly stiffness, tightly buttoned up
in a frock coat and wearing on his chin the little beard which in
the days of Napoleon III was called an imperial, stopped short on
the threshold. Everyone rose and stepped forward to greet the
other. Ralph did not doubt for a moment that he was the author of
the unsigned letter, the man for whom they were waiting, whom the
Baron had called Beaumagnan. Although he was the only one of them
to have no title, nor even the "de" before his name, they welcomed
him as one welcomes a leader, with a respect which his air
domination and his imperious eyes seemed naturally to exact. His
face was clean-shaven; his cheeks were hollow; there was in the
glances of his fine black eyes a quality of passion. In his manner
and in his dress there was something severe, even ascetic; he had
the air of a dignitary of the Church.</p>

<p>He begged them to sit down, apologized for having been unable to
bring his friend the Count de Brie, beckoned his companion forward
and introduced him:</p>

<p>"The Prince of Arcola...I believe you know that the Prince of
Arcola is one of us, but, as luck would have it, was unable to be
present at our meetings and that his activities were exercised at a
distance and with the happiest results. Today his evidence is
necessary to us, since twice already, in eighteen-seventy, he met
the infernal creature who threatens us."</p>

<p>Ralph was conscious of a slight disappointment; working it out,
the "infernal creature" must be more than fifty years of age, since
her meetings with the Prince of Arcola had taken place two and
twenty years before.</p>

<p>Thereupon the Prince sat down beside Oscar de Bennetot; and
Beaumagnan drew Godfrey d'Etigues aside. The Baron handed him an
envelope, containing doubtless the compromising letter. Then they
held in low voices a discussion of a certain liveliness, which
Beaumagnan cut short with a gesture of virile command.</p>

<p>"There is no doing anything with the gentlemen," said Ralph to
himself. "The verdict is fixed. Dead men tell no tales. The
drowning will take place, for it seems quite clear that that is the
solution on which he is resolved."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan sat down behind the other conspirators. But before
sitting down he said in cold and measured tones:</p>

<p>"You know, my friends, to what a degree this hour is serious for
us. All of us, in complete agreement and of one mind about the
magnificent end which we wish to accomplish, have undertaken a
common task of immense importance. It appears to us, and rightly,
that the interests of our country, those of our party, and those of
our religion&mdash;I do not separate the one from the
others&mdash;are linked with the success of our schemes. Now these
schemes have for some time been brought up short by the audacious
and implacable hostility of a woman, who, being in possession of
certain evidence, has set herself to discover the secret which we
are on the very point of discovering. If she discovers it before we
do, it means that all our efforts have been wasted, utterly. Her or
us: there is no room for the two. Let us pray earnestly that the
struggle in which we are engaged may be decided in our favor!"</p>

<p>He sat down, and resting his two arms on the back of a chair,
bent his tall figure as if he wished to remain unseen.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed.</p>

<p>The silence of these men met together for reasons which should
have excited them to lively converse, was absolute, so keenly was
the attention of all fixed on the distant noises which came from
the surrounding country. The capture of this woman obsessed their
minds. They were in a hurry to hold and to see their adversary.</p>

<p>The Baron d'Etigues raised his hand. They began to catch the
dull rhythm of a horse's hoofs.</p>

<p>"It is my brougham," he said.</p>

<p>Yes: but was their enemy inside it?</p>

<p>The Baron rose and went to the door. As usual the Park was
empty, since the servants' work kept them busy in the courtyard in
front of the château.</p>

<p>The sound of hoofs grew louder. The carriage left the high road
and came along the lane. Then it suddenly appeared between the two
pillars of the entrance to the Park. The driver waved a reassuring
hand; and the Baron exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Victory! They've got her!"</p>

<p>The brougham stopped at the door. D'Ormont, who was driving it,
jumped smartly down. Rufus d'Estiers stepped out of it. With the
help of the Baron they drew from the interior a woman whose wrists
and ankles were bound. A gauze scarf covered her face. They carried
her to the church bench which stood in the middle of the
chamber.</p>

<p>"Not the least difficulty," said d'Ormont in a tone of triumph.
"She came straight out of the train and stepped into the brougham.
At the crossroads we tied her up before she had time to let out
more than two squeals."</p>

<p>"Remove that scarf," said the Baron; and as D'Ormont stooped to
do so, he added: "After all, we may as well restore her freedom of
movement. We have her safe."</p>

<p>He himself untied the cords.</p>

<p>D'Ormont raised the veil and uncovered her face.</p>

<p>There came a cry of amazement from the spectators; and Ralph, up
in his observation post, from which he had a view of the prisoner
in full daylight, was hard put to it not to betray his presence by
a similar exclamation, when there was revealed a young woman in all
the splendor of her youth and beauty.</p>

<p>Then a voice rose above the murmurs of astonishment. The Prince
of Arcola stepped forward, and his starting eyes glaring in a
twitching face, stammered:</p>

<p>"It's she!...It <i>is</i> she...I recognize her...But what a
frightful thing it is!"</p>

<p>"What is it?" snapped the Baron. "What's frightful?
Explain!"</p>

<p>And the Prince of Arcola uttered these incredible words:</p>

<p>"<i>She is no older than she was two and twenty years
ago!</i>"</p>

<p>The woman was sitting, and sitting quite upright, her clenched
fists resting on her knees. Her hat must have fallen off in the
course of the attack on her, and her hair, half-undone, fell behind
her in a thick mass, partly held up by a gold comb, while two rolls
with tawny gleams in them were drawn back evenly above her brow,
and were waved a little above her temples.</p>

<p>Her face was of a wonderful beauty, its lines of an astonishing
purity; and it was animated by an expression which, even in her
impassibility, even in her fear, appeared to be a smile. With her
rather delicate chin, rather high cheek bones, deep-set eyes, and
heavy eyelids, she recalled those women of Leonardo da Vinci, or
rather of Bernardino Luini, all the charm of whom is in a smile you
do not actually see, but which you divine, which at once moves and
disquiets you.</p>

<p>She was simply dressed: a dust cloak which she let fall, a gray
woollen dress which, fitting tightly, gave the lovely curves of her
figure their full value.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Ralph, who could not take his eyes off her, softly
to himself. "She appears quite inoffensive, this magnificent and
infernal creature! And they're nine or ten to one against her!"</p>

<p>She scrutinized with keen eyes the group of men round her,
d'Etigues and his friends, and strove to see clearly those others
in the shadow. Then she said:</p>

<p>"What is it you want? I do not recognize any of you. What have
you brought me here for?"</p>

<p>"You're our enemy," declared Godfrey d'Etigues.</p>

<p>She shook her head gently.</p>

<p>"Your enemy? There must be some mistake. Are you quite sure that
you're not making a mistake? I am Madame Pellegrini."</p>

<p>"You're not Madame Pellegrini."</p>

<p>"But I assure you..."</p>

<p>"You're not!" the Baron exclaimed in a loud voice.</p>

<p>Then he added&mdash;and the words were little less disconcerting
than those uttered a little while before by the Prince of
Arcola:</p>

<p>"<i>Pellegrini was one of the aliases adopted in the eighteenth
century by the man whose daughter you pretend to be.</i>"</p>

<p>She did not answer for a few seconds, seeming to be taken aback
by the absurdity of the statement. Then she said tartly:</p>

<p>"Then what is my name&mdash;according to you?"</p>

<p>"<i>Josephine Balsamo, Countess of Cagliostro.</i>"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>2. Josephine Balsamo Born in
1788</h2>

<p>Cagliostro! The astonishing man who puzzled all Europe and so
thoroughly upset the Court of France in the reign of Louis XVI! The
Queen's necklace...Cardinal de Rohan...Marie Antoinette...some of
the most obscure episodes in history!</p>

<p>A strange man, and enigmatic, dowered with a veritable genius
for intrigue. A man who exercised a genuine power of domination. A
man on whom full light has not yet been thrown. Impostor? Who
knows? Have we the right to deny that certain beings of more
delicate sensibilities than ourselves can peer into the world of
the living and the dead in a fashion which is forbidden to us? Is
one to treat as charlatan or fool the man in whose mind rise the
memories of past existences, who, recalling what he has seen, reaps
the harvest of acquisitions in the past, of lost secrets, and
forgotten knowledge, and exploits a power which we call
supernatural, but which is merely putting into action, hesitating
perhaps and stumbling action, forces of which we are, it may be, on
the point of becoming masters?</p>

<p>If Ralph d'Andresy, from the bottom of his post of observation,
remained sceptical, if he laughed in his heart, not perhaps without
certain reservations, at the fashion in which events were shaping
themselves, it seemed that those taking part in them were accepting
on the instant and without question, as realities beyond all
discussing, the most extravagant assertions.</p>

<p>Had they then proofs and an understanding of this matter
peculiar to themselves? Had they found in her who, according to
them, laid claim to be the daughter of Cagliostro, gifts of
clairvoyance and divination which, in days gone by, the world
attributed to that celebrated worker of wonders, and by reason of
them treated him as magician and sorcerer?</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues, who was the only one of them standing, bent
towards the young woman and said:</p>

<p>"Your name really is Cagliostro, isn't it?"</p>

<p>She pondered. One would have said that, taking thought how best
to defend herself, she was seeking the best counterstroke; that she
wished, before definitely plunging into the struggle, to know what
weapons the enemy had at his command. Then she answered
quietly:</p>

<p>"Nothing compels me to give you an answer, since you have no
right whatever to question me. However, why should I deny that on
my birth certificate is the name Josephine Pellegrini and that it
is my whim to call myself Josephine Balsamo, Countess of
Cagliostro? The two names Cagliostro and Pellegrini complete the
personality of Joseph Balsamo, a personality in which I have always
taken the greatest interest."</p>

<p>"Then it follows that, contrary to certain declarations you used
to make, you are not his direct descendant. Is that what you wish
to imply?" said the Baron.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and said nothing. Was it prudence?
Was it disdain? Or was it a protest against such an absurdity?</p>

<p>"I do not care to consider this silence either an avowal or a
denial," said Godfrey d'Etigues, turning towards his friends. "What
this woman says is of no importance; and it is a waste of time to
refute her statements. We're here to make our decisions, most
important decisions, in a matter which we all know in its entirety,
but of which certain details are unknown to the majority of us. It
is then necessary to run over the main facts. They are set forth as
shortly as possible in the memorandum which I am going to read to
you, and to which I beg you to give your most earnest
attention."</p>

<p>And he read quietly a document which&mdash;at least Ralph had no
doubt about&mdash;it must have been drawn up by Beaumagnan. It
ran:</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>At the beginning of March, 1870, that is to say, four months
before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian war, among the crowd of
strangers who, as was usual every spring, descended on Paris, none
excited greater interest than the Countess Cagliostro. Beautiful,
charming, lavish of her money, generally alone, but sometimes
accompanied by a young man, whom she introduced to people as her
brother, everywhere she went, in every house into which she was
welcomed, she was the object of the most lively curiosity.</p>

<p>First of all her mere name excited people's interest, then the
truly impressive fashion in which she emphasized her relationship
to the famous Cagliostro by her mysterious bearing, by certain
miraculous cures she effected, and by the answers she gave to those
who consulted her concerning their past or their future. The novel
of Alexander Dumas had made Joseph Balsamo, that is to say the
Count of Cagliostro, the fashion. Employing the same methods, even
more boldly, she boasted that she was Cagliostro's daughter,
declared that she knew the secret of eternal youth, and with a
smile spoke of this and that meeting, of this and that event which
had befallen her in the days of Napoleon I.</p>

<p>Such was her prestige that she forced open for herself the doors
of the Tuileries and appeared at the Court of Napoleon III. People
even talked of private séances at which the Empress Eugenie
gathered round the beautiful Countess her most faithful intimates.
A secret number of that satirical journal, the <i>Charivari</i>,
which was instantly suppressed, tells the story of one of the
séances in which an occasional collaborator took part. I quote this
passage from it:</p>

<p>She is truly a wonderful woman, with something of <i>La
Joconde</i> about her. Her expression changes very little but it is
very difficult to describe. It is quite as caressing and ingenuous
as perverse and cruel. There is a wealth of experience in her gaze
and a bitterness in her unchanging smile&mdash;such a wealth of
experience, indeed, that one is willing to allow her the eighty
years she allots to herself. Now and again she draws from her
pocket a small golden mirror, lets fall on it two drops from a tiny
flask, dries it, and look at herself in it. And once more she is
Youth in its most adorable perfection.</p>

<p>When we questioned her about it, she replied:</p>

<p>"This mirror belonged to Cagliostro. For those who look at
themselves in it with assured confidence, time stands still. Look:
the date is engraved on the back, 1783, and it is followed by four
lines which are the list of the four great enigmas. These enigmas
which he had set himself the task of solving, he had from the lips
of Queen Marie Antoinette herself; and he was wont to say, so at
least they told me, that the man who found the key to them would be
a King of Kings."</p>
</div>

<p class="footnote">[* The first enigma was solved by a young girl
(see <i>The Secret Tomb</i>, by Maurice Leblanc). The two next were
solved by Arsène Lupin (see <i>The Island of the Thirty Shrouds</i>
and <i>The Hollow Needle</i>). The solving of the fourth is the
theme of this book.</p>
]&gt;

<p>"May one hear them?" somebody asked.</p>

<p>"Why not? To know them is not to solve them; and Cagliostro
himself hadn't the time to do so. I can only give you their titles.
They are:</p>

<p>"<i>In Robore Fortuna.</i></p>

<p>"The Flagstone of the Bohemian Kings.</p>

<p>"The Fortunes of the Kings of France.</p>

<p>"The Candlestick with Seven Branches."</p>

<p>Afterwards she talked to all of us in turn; and to each she made
astonishing revelations.</p>

<p>But that was only the prelude; and the Empress, though she
refused to put the most trivial question about matters which
concerned her personally, asked her to throw some light on the
future.</p>

<p>"Would your Majesty be so good as to breathe lightly on this,"
said the Countess, holding out the mirror.</p>

<p>And forthwith, after examining the mist that the Queen's breath
had spread over its surface she murmured:</p>

<p>"I see many excellent things...In the summer great
war...Victory...The return of the troops under the Arc de
Triomphe...They are cheering the Emperor...The Prince
Imperial..."</p>

<p><br>
Godfrey d'Etigues folded the paper and went on:</p>

<p>"Such is the document which has been communicated to us. It is a
disconcerting document since it was published several weeks before
the war it foretold. What was this woman? Who was this adventuress
whose dangerous predictions, acting on the somewhat feeble mind of
our unfortunate sovereign, played their part in bringing about the
catastrophe of 1870? Someone&mdash;you will find it in the same
number of the <i>Charivari</i>, said to her one day:</p>

<p>"'Granted that you are the daughter of Cagliostro, who was your
mother?'</p>

<p>"'For my mother,' she replied, 'you must look high among the
contemporaries of Cagliostro...higher still...Yes: that's
right...Josephine de Beauharnais, the future wife of Bonaparte,
Empress that was to be.'</p>

<p>"The police of Napoleon III could not remain inactive. At the
end of June they sent in a report the facts of which were
established after a difficult inquiry by one of their best agents.
I'll read it. It runs:</p>

<div class="newspaper">
<p>"The Signorina's Italian passport, while making reservations
about the date of her birth, describes her as Josephine
Pellegrini-Balsamo, Countess of Cagliostro, born at Palermo on the
29th of July, 1788. Having gone to Palermo, I succeeded in
discovering the old registers of the Parish of Mortarana; and in
one of them, under the date of the 29th of July, 1788, I found the
entry of the birth of Josephine Balsamo, daughter of Joseph Balsamo
and Josephine de la P., subject of the King of France.</p>

<p>"Was it Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie, the maiden name of the
young wife who was separated from the Vicomte de Beauharnais, and
of the future wife of General Bonaparte? I made investigations from
this point of view. They required considerable patience; but at the
end of them I learnt from the manuscript letters of a Lieutenant
<i>de la prévôté</i>, of Paris, that in 1788 they had been on the
point of arresting the Count of Cagliostro, who, though he had been
expelled from France after the affair of the Queen's Necklace, was
living in a little house at Fontainebleau under the name of
Pellegrini; and at that house he was visited every day by a tall
and slender lady. Now Josephine de Beauharnais was at this time
living at Fontainebleau. She was tall and slender. On the eve of
the day fixed for his arrest Cagliostro disappeared. His departure
was the very next day followed by the departure of Josephine de
Beauharnais.* A month later the child was born at Palermo.</p>

<p>"These coincidences cannot fail to be impressive. But how much
greater is the weight of them, when one considers them in the light
of these two additional facts&mdash;ten years later the Empress
Josephine brought to La Malmaison a young girl whom she declared to
be her god daughter. This child won the heart of the Emperor to
such a degree that he took the greatest pleasure in playing with
her. What was her name? Josephine, or rather Josine. Secondly, on
the fall of the Empire, the Czar Alexander II received this Josine
at his Court. What title does she take? That of the Countess de
Cagliostro."</p>
</div>

<p class="footnote">[* Hitherto none of the biographies of
Josephine have given any explanation of the fact that she in a way
fled from Fontainebleau. Only Monsieur Frederic Masson, scenting
the truth, writes: "Perhaps one day some letter will be found which
will demonstrate the <i>physical</i> necessity of this
departure."]</p>

<p>The Baron d'Etigues laid great stress on these last words. They
had listened to him with the deepest attention. Ralph, taken aback
by this incredible story, tried to catch a shade of emotion or of
some feeling on the face of the Countess. But she remained
impassive, her beautiful eyes always faintly smiling.</p>

<p>The Baron continued: "This report and probably the dangerous
influence which the Countess was beginning to acquire at the
Tuileries, were to cut short her brilliant career. A decree for her
expulsion was signed and for the expulsion of her brother. Her
brother went away to Germany, she to Italy. One morning she arrived
at Modena, whither she had been conducted by a young officer. He
bowed, saluted her, and left her. This officer was the Prince of
Arcola. He it was who was able to procure these two documents, the
suppressed number of the <i>Charivari</i> and the secret report,
the original of which is actually in his possession, with the
official seals and signatures. Lastly it is he who a little while
ago assured you of the indubitable identity of the woman he left
that morning at Modena with the woman he sees here today."</p>

<p>The Prince of Arcola rose and said gravely:</p>

<p>"I am no believer in miracles; nevertheless what I say is the
affirmation of a miracle. But the truth compels me to declare on my
honor as a soldier that this is the woman whom I saluted and left
at the railway station at Modena two and twenty years ago."</p>

<p>"Whom you saluted and left without anything in the nature of a
polite farewell?" said Josephine Balsamo. She had turned towards
the Prince and asked the question in a tone of mocking irony.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that a young French officer is too courteous to take his
leave of a pretty woman with just a formal salute."</p>

<p>"Which implies?"</p>

<p>"Which implies that you must have uttered some words."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. I no longer remember," said the Prince of Arcola with
a touch of embarrassment.</p>

<p>"You bent down towards the exile, Monsieur. You kissed her hand
rather longer than was necessary; and you said to her: 'I hope,
Madam, that the hours I have had the pleasure of passing near you
will not be without a tomorrow. For my part, I can never forget
them.' And you repeated, emphasizing by your accent your gallant
meaning: 'You understand, Madam? Never.'"</p>

<p>The Prince of Arcola appeared to be a man of admirable manners.
However, at this exact revival of a moment that had passed a
quarter of a century earlier, he was so upset that he muttered:</p>

<p>"Well, I'll be damned!"</p>

<p>But, recovering himself on the instant, he took the offensive,
and in a bitter voice he said: "Madam, I have forgotten. If the
memory of that meeting was pleasant, the memory of the second
occasion on which I saw you has blotted it out."</p>

<p>"And this second occasion, Monsieur?"</p>

<p>"It was at the beginning of the following year, at Versailles,
whither I accompanied the French plenipotentiaries entrusted with
the task of negotiating the peace of the defeat. I saw you in a
café, sitting at a table, drinking and laughing with some German
officers, one of whom was an officer of Bismarck's staff. That day
I understood the part you played at the Tuileries and on whose
errand you came."</p>

<p>All these revelations of the vicissitudes of a life which seemed
fabulous, were set forth in less than ten minutes. There was no
structure of reasoning. No attempt, either logical or rhetorical,
to impose this in credible thesis on those who were listening.
Nothing but the facts, nothing but the bare proofs, violent, driven
home like the blows of a fist, and all the more terrifying that
they evoked against a quite young woman memories some of which went
back more than a century!</p>

<p>Ralph d'Andresy was almost amazed. The scene appeared to him to
savor of romance, or rather to be long to some fantastic and gloomy
melodrama. These conspirators, who accepted these fables as if they
had been indisputable facts, seemed to him the creatures of a
dream. Truly he was quite alive to the poorness of the intelligence
of these country bumpkins, relics of an epoch that had passed away.
But all the same how on earth could they bring themselves to ignore
the very data of the problem presented by the age they attributed
to this woman? However credulous they might be, had they not eyes
to see?</p>

<p>Again the attitude of the Countess to them appeared even more
strange. Why this silence which, when all was said and done, was an
acceptance of their theory, practically, at times, a confession?
Was she refusing to demolish a legend of eternal youth which was
pleasing to her and helpful to the execution of her plans? Or was
it that, ignorant of the terrible danger hanging over her head, she
looked upon all this theatrical display as merely a practical
joke?</p>

<p>"Such is this woman's past," continued the Baron d'Etigues
solemnly. "I shall not dwell on the intermediate episodes which
link that past with today. Always keeping behind the scenes,
Josephine Balsamo, the Countess of Cagliostro, played a part in the
tragicomedy of Boulangism, in the sordid drama of Panama. One finds
her hand in every event which is disastrous to our country. But in
these matters we have only indications of the secret part she
played. We have no direct proof. Let us leave them and come to this
actual epoch. One word before we do so, however. Have you no
observations to make about any of these matters, Madam?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said.</p>

<p>"Let us have them."</p>

<p>"Well," said the young woman, with the same note of mocking
irony in her delightful voice, "I should like to know, since I
appear to be on my trial and you to have formed yourselves into a
really medieval tribunal&mdash;of the German brand, of
course&mdash;whether you attach any real importance to the charges
you have heaped up against me. If you do you may as well condemn me
to be burnt alive on the spot, as a witch, a spy, and a
renegade&mdash;all crimes which the Inquisition never
pardoned."</p>

<p>"No," replied Godfrey d'Etigues. "I have only narrated these
different adventures of yours in order to paint, in a few strokes,
as vivid a picture of you as possible."</p>

<p>"You think you have painted as vivid a picture of me as
possible?"</p>

<p>"Yes; from the point of view that concerns us."</p>

<p>"You are certainly easily satisfied," she said in a faintly
contemptuous tone. "And what are the links you think you see
between these different adventures?"</p>

<p>"I see three kinds of links," said the Baron with some heat.
"First there is the evidence of all the people who have recognized
you, thanks to whom we can go back, step by step, to the end of the
eighteenth century. Next your own avowal of your claims."</p>

<p>"What avowal?"</p>

<p>"You have repeated to the Prince of Arcola the very terms of a
conversation which took place between the two of you in the station
at Modena."</p>

<p>"So I did!" she said. "And then?"</p>

<p>"And then I have here three portraits, all three of which are
portraits of you. Are they not?"</p>

<p>She looked at them and said: "Yes. They are portraits of
me."</p>

<p>"Well," said Godfrey d'Etigues in a tone of triumph, "the first
is a miniature, painted at Moscow in 1816, of Josine, Countess of
Cagliostro. The second is this photograph taken in the year 1870.
This is the last, taken recently in Paris. The miniature has your
signature on the back, after the words presenting it to Prince
Serge Dolgorouki; the two photographs have your signature across
the face. All the three signatures are letter for letter the same
with the same flourish."</p>

<p>"What does that prove?" she asked in the same mocking, ironical
accents.</p>

<p>"That proves that the same woman retains in 1892 her face of
1816 and of 1870."</p>

<p>"Then to the stake with her!" she cried and laughed a silvery,
rippling laugh.</p>

<p>"Do not laugh, Madam. You know that between you and us a laugh
is an abominable blasphemy!" cried the Baron sternly.</p>

<p>She struck the arm of the bench with an impatient hand.</p>

<p>"Look here, Monsieur: we've had enough of this nonsense!" she
exclaimed, frowning at the Baron. "What is it exactly that you have
against me? What am I here for?"</p>

<p>"You're here, Madam, to pay the penalty of the crimes you have
committed."</p>

<p>"What crimes?"</p>

<p>"My friends and I were twelve, twelve men who were seeking the
same end. Now we are only nine. The three others are dead. You
murdered them!"</p>

<p><br>
A shadow, perhaps&mdash;at least Ralph d'Andresy thought that he
saw one&mdash;veiled for a moment, like a cloud, the smile of the
Giaconda. Then on the instant her beautiful face resumed its usual
expression as if nothing could ruffle its serenity, not even this
frightful accusation launched at her with so violent a virulence.
You might very well have said that the ordinary feelings of
humanity were unknown to her, or that at any rate they did not
betray themselves by those symptoms of indignation, revolt, and
horror with which all human beings are overwhelmed. What an anomaly
she was! Guilty or not, any other woman would have risen in revolt.
She said never a word. It might have been cynicism; it might have
been innocence. There was no saying.</p>

<p>The friends of the Baron remained motionless, their brows
knitted, their faces stern. Behind those who hid him almost
entirely from the eyes of Josephine Balsamo, Ralph perceived
Beaumagnan. His arms still resting on the back of the chair in
front of him, he kept his face buried in his hands. But his eyes,
gleaming between his parted fingers, never left the face of his
enemy.</p>

<p>In a complete silence Godfrey d'Etigues proceeded to develop his
indictment, or rather his three terrible indictments. He did so
coldly, without raising his voice. It was as if a clerk were
reading an indictment in which he had no personal interest.</p>

<p>"Eighteen months ago," he began, "Denis Saint-Hébert, the
youngest of us, was out shooting on his estate in the neighborhood
of Le Havre. At the end of the afternoon, he left his bailiff and
his keeper and went off, with his gun over his shoulder, to look at
the sunset over the sea, from the top of the cliff. He did not turn
up that night. Next day they found his body among the rocks
uncovered by the ebbing tide.</p>

<p>"Suicide? Denis Saint-Hébert was rich, in the best of health,
and of a happy disposition. Why should he have killed himself? A
crime. No one dreamt of such a thing. An accident, then.</p>

<p>"In the following June we were again plunged into mourning under
analogous conditions. George d'Isneauval, while shooting gulls in
the early morning, slipped on the seaweed in such a disastrous
fashion that he struck his head against a rock and fractured his
skull. Some hours later two fishermen found him. He was dead. He
left a widow and two little children.</p>

<p>"Again an accident, I suppose. Yes: an accident for his widow,
his children and his family. But for us? Was it possible that
Chance should for the second time have attacked the little group we
had formed? Twelve friends form a league to discover a great
secret, to attain an end of considerable importance. Two of them
are struck down. Are we not compelled to presume the existence of a
criminal conspiracy which, in attacking them, at the same time
attacks their enterprise?</p>

<p>"It was the Prince of Arcola who opened our eyes and set us on
the right path. He knew that we were not the only persons to know
of the existence of this great secret. He knew that, in the course
of a séance in the suite of rooms of the Empress Eugenie at the
Tuileries, someone had revived the list of the four enigmas handed
down to his descendants by Cagliostro, and that one of them was
called by the very name of the enigma in which we are
interested&mdash;the enigma of the Candlestick with Seven Branches.
Must we not therefore seek among those to whom the legend could
have been handed down?</p>

<p>"Thanks to the excellent means of investigation which we had at
our disposal, our inquiry bore fruit in barely a fortnight. In a
private hotel in a quiet street in Paris was living a lady of the
name of Pellegrini. Apparently she was leading an almost secluded
life and often disappeared for months at a time. Of uncommon
beauty, her behavior was discreetness itself. Indeed it appeared to
be her main effort not to attract attention. Under the name of the
Countess of Cagliostro she frequented certain circles which busied
themselves with magic, the occult, and the black mass.</p>

<p>"We managed to get a photograph of her&mdash;this one. We sent
it to the Prince of Arcola, who was traveling in Spain. He was
amazed to recognize the woman he had formerly known.</p>

<p>"We made inquiries about her movements. On the day of
Saint-Hébert's death, in the neighborhood of Le Havre, she was
staying at Le Havre. She was staying at Dieppe when George
d'Isneauval met his death at the foot of the Dieppe cliffs!</p>

<p>"I questioned the dead men's families. The widow of George
d'Isneauval confided to me that her husband, towards the end of his
life, had had an affair with a woman who caused him, according to
her, an infinite amount of suffering. In the other quarter a
written confession of Saint-Hébert, and up to then kept secret by
his mother, informed us that he had been so foolish as to jot down
our twelve names and some facts about the Candlestick with the
Seven Branches on one of the leaves of his pocketbook and that
pocketbook had been stolen from him by a woman.</p>

<p>"After that everything was clear. Mistress of a part of our
secrets, and desirous of knowing more, the woman who had been loved
by Saint-Hébert had thrown herself across the path of George
d'Isneauval and been loved by him. Then, having wormed their
secrets out of them, in her fear of their denouncing her to their
friends, she murdered them. That woman is here before us."</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues paused again. The silence once more became
oppressive, so heavy that the judges seemed to be paralyzed in that
burdensome atmosphere so loaded with anguish. Only the Countess of
Cagliostro maintained her air of aloofness, as if no single word
had concerned her.</p>

<p>Always stretched at full length in his post of observation,
Ralph admired the young woman's delightful and voluptuous beauty;
at the same time he could not help feeling some distress at
perceiving such a mass of evidence being piled up against her. The
indictment gripped her tighter and tighter. From every quarter
facts thronged to the assault; and Ralph suspected that she was
threatened by a yet more direct attack.</p>

<p>"Am I to tell you about the third crime?" said the Baron.</p>

<p>She replied in weary accents:</p>

<p>"If you like. Everything you have been saying is quite
unintelligible. You have been talking about people whose very names
I never heard before. So a crime more or less&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You didn't know Saint-Hébert and George d'Isneauval?"</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and did not answer.</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues bent closer to her and in a lower voice he
said:</p>

<p>"And Beaumagnan?"</p>

<p>She raised limpid eyes to his face:</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the third of our friends you murdered. And only a
little while ago...A few weeks...He died poisoned...You did not
know him?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>3. A Tribunal of the
Inquisition</h2>

<p>What was the meaning of this accusation? Ralph looked at
Beaumagnan. He had risen, without raising himself to his full
height, and sheltering himself behind his friends drew nearer and
nearer to Josephine Balsamo. With her eyes fixed intently on the
Baron, she paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>Then Ralph understood why Beaumagnan had hidden himself and the
formidable trap they were laying for the young woman. If she had
really tried to poison Beaumagnan, if she really believed him dead,
with what a fear she would be stricken when he stepped forward in
person to face her, living, ready to accuse her! If, on the other
hand, she remained untroubled and Beaumagnan appeared to her as
great a stranger as the others, what a proof of her innocence!</p>

<p>Ralph found himself extraordinarily anxious. Indeed so keenly
did he desire her to succeed in foiling the plotters that he tried
to find some method of conveying a warning to her.</p>

<p>But the Baron d'Etigues did not loose his prey; and he continued
with scarcely a pause: "Then you don't remember this crime either,
do you?"</p>

<p>For the first time displaying a touch of impatience, she frowned
at him; but she said nothing.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you never even knew Beaumagnan?" said the Baron,
bending towards her like an examining magistrate watching for a
clumsy sentence. "Come, speak up! You never knew him?"</p>

<p>She did not speak up; she did not speak at all. The effect of
his obstinate insistence must have been to awaken her distrust, for
a shadow of anxiety dimmed her smile. Like a hunted beast, she
scented an ambush; and her eyes searched the shadows.</p>

<p>She studied Godfrey d'Etigues, then turned towards de la
Vaulpalier and de Bennetot, then to the other side where Beaumagnan
was standing. On the instant there was a gesture of dismay, the
start of one who sees a phantom; and her eyes closed. She stretched
out her hands to thrust away the terrible vision which menaced her
and they heard her mutter:</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan! Beaumagnan!"</p>

<p>Was it the avowal? Was she going to weaken and confess her
crime? Beaumagnan waited. With all the force of his being, so to
speak, visible, with clenched fists, with the veins on his forehead
swollen, with his stern face convulsed by a superhuman effort of
will, he demanded that access of feebleness in which all resistance
crumbles.</p>

<p>For a moment he thought he was succeeding. The young woman was
weakening; she was yielding to her tamer. A cruel joy illuminated
his face. A vain hope! Recovering from her faintness, she drew
herself slowly upright. Every second restored to her a little of
her serenity and little by little freed her smile; and she said
with a reasonableness which appeared the very expression of the
obvious truth:</p>

<p>"You did give me a fright, Beaumagnan! I read in the newspapers
the news of your death. Why did your friends try to trick me?"</p>

<p>Ralph realized at once that everything that had passed up to
that moment was of no importance. Now the two real adversaries
found themselves face to face. Short as it must be, given the
weapons of Beaumagnan and the isolation of the young woman, the
real struggle was only just beginning. And this was not the cunning
and sustained attack of the Baron d'Etigues. But the wild onslaught
of an enemy exasperated by rage and hate.</p>

<p>"A lie! A lie!" he cried. "Everything in you is a lie. You are
hypocrisy, vileness, treason, vice! Everything sordid and repulsive
in the world is masked by your smile. Ah! That smile! What an
abominable mask! One longs to tear it from you with red-hot
pincers. Your smile is death! It is the everlasting damnation of
the man who lets himself be charmed by it...Heavens! What a wretch
this woman is."</p>

<p>The impression that Ralph had had from the beginning of being a
spectator in a scene from the Inquisition, grew infinitely stronger
in face of the fury of this man who hurled his anathema with all
the violence of a monk of the Middle Ages. His voice trembled with
indignation. His gestures were a threat, as if he were going to
strangle the impious creature whose divine smile brought madness on
her victim and doomed him to the fires of Hell.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, Beaumagnan," she said with an excess of
gentleness that infuriated him more than if she had hurled an
insult at him.</p>

<p>Nevertheless he struggled to restrain himself and to control the
words which surged up in him. But they rushed from his mouth,
storming, headlong, or muttered so faintly that his friends, whom
he now addressed, had sometimes great difficulty in understanding
the strange confession he was making, beating himself on the breast
exactly like the penitents of the days of yore making public
confession of their sins.</p>

<p>"It was I, I, who deliberately entered the arena after the death
of d'Isneauval. Yes: I was sure that this sorceress was still
raging on our trail...That I should be stronger than the others.
Safer against temptation...And I was right! You know I was
right!...You all knew my intention at that time. Already dedicated
to the service of the Church, I was desirous of assuming the robe
of a priest. I was, then, secure from the evil, protected by formal
undertakings and even more by the intense ardor of my faith. In
that temper I betook myself to one of the Spiritist meetings at
which I knew I should find her.</p>

<p>"She was there; and there was no need for the friend who had
brought me, to point her out to me; and I confess that, on the very
threshold of my enterprise, an obscure apprehension made me
hesitate. I watched her. She spoke to few of the people present and
wore an air of reserve, content seemingly to listen, smoking
cigarettes.</p>

<p>"In accordance with my instructions my friend went and sat down
beside her and entered into conversation with the persons among
whom she was sitting. Then from a distance he called me by my name;
and I saw from her troubled look, without any possibility of being
mistaken, that she knew that name. She had read it in the
pocketbook stolen from Denis Saint-Hébert. Beaumagnan was one of
the twelve associates...One of the ten survivors. And this woman
who appeared to live in a kind of dream, suddenly awoke. A little
while after she spoke to me. For two hours she displayed all the
charm of her spirit, she used every weapon that beauty gives a
woman, and in the end induced me to promise that I would go to see
her the next day.</p>

<p>"At that instant, at the very second at which I left her, that
night, at the door of her house, I ought to have fled to the end of
the world. It was already too late. There was no longer in me
either courage, or will, or foresight, nothing but the insane
desire to see her again. It is true that I disguised this desire in
fine phrases: I was accomplishing a duty...It was necessary to know
the enemy's game, to bring home her crimes to her and punish her
for them, and so forth...Mere pretexts! In reality at the first
assault I had fallen a victim to her fascination; at the first
assault I was convinced of her innocence. A smile such as that was
clear evidence of a soul of crystal purity.</p>

<p>"Neither the sacred memory of Saint-Hébert, nor that of my poor
d'Isneauval cleared my vision. I would not see. I lived for some
months in obscurity, tasting the most infamous joys, without even a
blush at being an object of reproach and scandal, at renouncing my
vows and denying my faith.</p>

<p>"Inconceivable sins in a man like me, I swear it, friends.
Nevertheless I committed another which per haps surpasses them all.
I was a traitor to our cause. I broke that vow of silence which we
took when we formed our union for that common end. <i>This woman
knows as much of the great secret as we know ourselves.</i>"</p>

<p>At these words a murmur of indignation ran round the room.
Beaumagnan bent his head.</p>

<p>Now Ralph understood better the drama which was unfolding before
him; and the characters who were playing their parts in it assumed
their right proportion. Country squires, rustics, bumpkins?
Yes&mdash;without a doubt. But Beaumagnan was
there&mdash;Beaumagnan who inspired them with his own spirit and
filled them with his exaltation. In the middle of these vulgar
lives and these absurd figures he stood forth the prophet and the
seer. He had forced on them as a duty some conspirator's task to
which he had devoted himself body and soul, as in the old days one
devoted oneself to God, and left one's castle to go on a
crusade.</p>

<p>Mystic passions of this kind transform those in whom they burn
into heroes or executioners. In Beaumagnan there was a veritable
inquisitor. In the fifteenth century he would have persecuted and
mangled to tear from the impious the confession of faith.</p>

<p>He had the instinct of domination and the bearing of a man for
whom no obstacle exists. Did a woman rise between him and his end?
Let her die. If he loved this woman, a public confession absolved
him. And those who listened to him succumbed to the ascendancy of
this hard master all the more easily because his hardness appeared
to be directed quite as much against himself.</p>

<p>Humiliated by the confession of his fall, he was no longer
angry; and he continued in a dull voice:</p>

<p>"Why did I fail? I do not know. A man like me ought not to fail.
I have not even the excuse of being able to say that she questioned
me. She did not. She often talked about the four enigmas mentioned
by Cagliostro; and one day almost without knowing what I was doing,
I spoke the irreparable words...like a wretched weakling...just to
make myself agreeable...just to seem important to her eyes...that
her smile might grow more tender. I said to myself: 'She shall be
our ally...She shall help us with her counsel, with her
clearsightedness, refined and heightened by years of practice of
divination. I was mad. The intoxication of sin had set my reason
tottering.</p>

<p>"The awakening was terrible. About three weeks ago I had to go
to Spain on a mission. I said goodbye to her in the morning. In the
afternoon, towards three o'clock, having an appointment in the
center of Paris I left the set of rooms in which I was living in
the Luxembourg. Then it chanced that, having forgotten to give some
orders to my man, I returned to my rooms through the courtyard and
up the servants' staircase. My man had gone out and left the
kitchen door open. As I came through it, I heard a noise. I went
forward quietly. There was someone in my bedroom. It was this
woman. I had a good view of her in the looking glass. What was she
doing, bending over my trunk? I watched. She opened a small
cardboard box which contained the cachets which I take when I'm
traveling, to cure my insomnia. She took out one of these cachets
and in its place she put another, a cachet which she took from her
purse.</p>

<p>"My emotion was so great that I never even dreamt of seizing
her. When I grew composed enough to enter the room, she had gone. I
could not overtake her.</p>

<p>"I hurried to a chemist and had the cachets analyzed. One of
them contained poison enough to destroy me.</p>

<p>"So I had the irrefutable proof. Having been so imprudent as to
tell her everything I knew about the secret, I had been condemned.
It was just as well, was it not, to clear out of her path a useless
witness and an associate who might one day or other take his share
of the spoils, or, it might be, reveal the truth, attack the enemy,
and vanquish her. Death then. Death&mdash;as for Denis Saint-Hébert
and George d'Isneauval. A stupid murder for no sufficient
reason.</p>

<p>"I wrote from Spain to one of my friends. Some days afterwards
certain newspapers announced the death of a Frenchman named
Beaumagnan at Madrid.</p>

<p>"From that time I lived in the shadow and followed her step by
step. She betook herself first to Rouen, then to Le Havre, then to
Dieppe, that is to say to the very places which bound the scene of
our researches. From what I had told her she knew that we were on
the point of ransacking an ancient Priory in the neighborhood of
Dieppe. She spent the whole of a day there, and profiting by the
fact that the building had been abandoned, searched it. Then I lost
sight of her. I found her at Rouen. You have heard what followed,
from d'Etigues. How the trap was laid and how she fell into it,
attracted by the bait of this Candlestick with Seven Branches,
which, as she believed, a peasant had unearthed.</p>

<p>"Such is the character of this woman. You realize the reasons
which prevent us from handing her over to the law. The scandal of
the proceedings would reflect on us, and throwing the full light of
day on to our enterprises, would render them impossible. Our duty,
however dreadful it may appear, is to judge her ourselves, without
hatred, but with all the severity that she deserves."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan was silent. He had ended his indictment with a
seriousness more dangerous to the accused than his anger. She
appeared undoubtedly guilty, almost a monster in this series of
useless murders. For his part, Ralph d'Andresy no longer knew what
to think; but he cursed in his heart this man who had loved the
young woman and who had just recalled, trembling with emotion, that
sacrilegious love.</p>

<p>The Countess of Cagliostro rose and looked her adversary full in
the face, always with a faintly mocking air.</p>

<p>"I was quite right," she said. "It is the stake?"</p>

<p>"That will be according as we decide," he said. "Nothing at any
rate can prevent the execution of our just sentence."</p>

<p>"A sentence? By what right?" said she. "There are judges for
that. You are not judges. You talk about the fear of scandal. What
does it matter to me that you need darkness and silence for your
schemes? Set me free."</p>

<p>"Free? Free to continue your work of death? You are in our
power. You will suffer our sentence," he said sternly.</p>

<p>"Your sentence for what? If there were a single judge among you,
a single man who had any sense of reason and probability, he would
laugh at your stupid charges and your unconnected proofs."</p>

<p>"Words! Phrases!" he cried. "What we want are proofs to the
contrary...Something to disprove the evidence that my eyes gave
me."</p>

<p>"What use would it be to defend myself? You have made up your
minds."</p>

<p>"We have made them up because you are guilty."</p>

<p>"Guilty of pursuing the same end as you; yes, that I admit. And
that is the reason why you committed that shameful action of coming
to spy upon me and play that comedy of love. If you were caught by
your own snare, all the worse for you. If you have revealed to me
facts about the enigma, of which I already knew the existence from
the document of Cagliostro, all the worse for you! Now it is an
obsession with me; and I have sworn to attain that end, whatever
happens, in spite of you. That and that only is my crime&mdash;in
your eyes."</p>

<p>"Your crime is murder," asserted Beaumagnan, who was again
losing his temper.</p>

<p>"I have not murdered anyone," she said firmly.</p>

<p>"You pushed Saint-Hébert over the cliff; you fractured
d'Isneauval's skull."</p>

<p>"Saint-Hébert? D'Isneauval? I never knew them. I hear their
names for the first time today," she protested.</p>

<p>"And me! And me!" he exclaimed violently. "Didn't you know
<i>me</i>? Didn't you try to poison <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He lost his temper utterly and in an access of fury he roared:
"But I saw you, Josephine Balsamo! I saw you as clearly as I see
you now! While you were putting that poison in the box, I saw your
smile grow ferocious and the corners of your lips rise in the grin
of the damned!"</p>

<p>She shook her head and said firmly:</p>

<p>"It was not I."</p>

<p>He appeared to choke. How dared she say such a thing?</p>

<p>But quite coolly she laid her hand on his shoulder and said
quietly:</p>

<p>"Hate is making you lose your wits, Beaumagnan. Your fanatical
soul is in a wild revolt against the sin of love. However, in spite
of that, I suppose you'll allow me to defend myself?"</p>

<p>"It is your right, but be quick about it," he said less loudly,
but coldly.</p>

<p>"It won't take long. Ask your friends for the miniature, painted
in 1816, of the Countess of Cagliostro."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan obeyed and took the miniature from the hands of the
Baron.</p>

<p>"Good. Look at it carefully," she went on. "It is my portrait,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"What are you driving at?" he said.</p>

<p>"Answer. Is it my portrait?" she said impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said with decision.</p>

<p>"Then if that is my portrait it means that I was alive at that
time? It is eighty years ago; and from that portrait I was then
twenty-five or thirty? Consider carefully before answering. What!
In the face of such a miracle you hesitate, do you? You dare not
assert that it is a fact; now, dare you?"</p>

<p>She paused, gazing at him with compelling eyes; then she
continued:</p>

<p>"But there is more to come. Open the frame of this miniature,
the back of it, and you will find on the other side of the
porcelain, another portrait. The portrait of a smiling woman,
wearing a veil, an almost invisible veil, which descends as far as
her eyebrows, and through which you can see her hair parted into
two waving rolls. It is me again, isn't it?"</p>

<p>While Beaumagnan carried out her instructions she had put on a
light veil of tulle, the bottom of which touched the line of her
eyebrows; and she lowered her eyes with an expression of charming
reserve.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan compared her face with the portrait and stammered:
"B-B-B-But it is you! It is!"</p>

<p>"Is there any doubt about it?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. It is you," he declared.</p>

<p>"Well, read the date on the right side of it."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan read out: "Painted at Milan in the year 1498."</p>

<p>She repeated: "In 1498&mdash;that's four hundred years ago?"</p>

<p>She laughed outright, a clear, ringing laugh.</p>

<p>"Don't look so astonished," she said. "I have known of the
existence of this double portrait for a long time, and I have been
hunting for it. But you may take it from me that there is no
miracle about it. I am not going to try to persuade you that I was
that painter's model and that I am four hundred years old. No: that
is merely the face of the Virgin Mary; and it is a copy of a
fragment of the Holy Family of Bernadino Luini, a Milanese painter
and a pupil of Leonardo da Vinci."</p>

<p>Then, with a sudden gravity, and without giving her adversary
time to breathe, she said to him: "You understand now what I am
driving at, don't you, Beaumagnan? Between the Virgin of Luini, the
young girl of Moscow and myself, there is that elusive, marvellous,
and yet undeniable bond, a likeness&mdash;an absolute
likeness...Three faces in one. Three faces which are not those of
three different women, but which are <i>the face of the same
woman</i>. Then why do you refuse to admit that the same
phenomenon, after all a perfectly natural phenomenon, should not
reproduce itself in other circumstances, and that the woman whom
you saw in your bedroom was not me, but another woman who resembles
me so closely as to deceive you. Another woman who knew and
murdered your friends Saint-Hébert and d'Isneauval?"</p>

<p>"I saw...I saw!" protested Beaumagnan, who had come so close to
her that he almost touched her, and he drew himself up, pale as
death and quivering with indignation. "I saw! I saw with my
eyes!"</p>

<p>"Your eyes also see the portrait of twenty-five years ago and
the miniature of eighty years ago, and the picture of four hundred
years ago. Is that me too?"</p>

<p>She presented to Beaumagnan's gaze her young face in all its
fresh beauty, that perfect row of white teeth, her delicately
tinted, rounded cheeks, her clear and limpid child's eyes.</p>

<p>Weakening, he stammered: "T-T-There are moments, sorceress, when
I b-b-believe in this absurdity. With you one never knows! Look:
the woman of the miniature has, low down on her bare shoulders, on
the white skin of her bosom, a black mark. That mark, it is there,
low down on your shoulder...I have seen it there...Come...Show it
to the others and let them see it too and be edified!"</p>

<p>He was livid and the sweat was trickling down his forehead. He
stretched out his hand towards her high necked bodice. But she
thrust it back, and speaking with considerable dignity, she
said:</p>

<p>"That's enough, Beaumagnan. You don't know what you're doing and
you haven't known for months. Listening to you just now I was
simply amazed, for you spoke of me as having been your mistress,
and I haven't been your mistress at all. It's all very fine to beat
your bosom in public, but it is also necessary that the confession
should be the truth. You hadn't the courage to tell the truth. The
demon of pride forbade you to admit the humiliating check you
received; and like a coward, you have let them believe in a thing
that never happened. During the months you were crawling at my feet
you entreated and threatened without your lips having ever once
brushed my hand. That's the secret of your behavior and your
hate.</p>

<p>"Failing to move me, you tried to destroy me and for your
friends you painted a frightful picture of me as criminal, spy, and
sorceress. Yes, as sorceress! A man like you, to use your own
words, could not fail; and if you did fail, it could have been
brought about by the action of diabolical witchcraft. No,
Beaumagnan: you no longer know what you are doing, or what you are
saying. You saw me in your bedroom substituting the cachet which
was to poison you, did you? Come now, by what right do you invoke
the testimony of your eyes? Your eyes? But they were obsessed by my
image; and that other woman showed you a face which was not her
own, but mine, and you could not help seeing it. Yes, Beaumagnan: I
repeat it, the other woman...There is another woman on the path we
are all of us following...There's another woman who has inherited
certain documents from Cagliostro and who also uses the names that
he assumed. Marquise de Belmonte, Countess de F...look for her,
Beaumagnan. For she it was whom you saw; and it is really upon the
stupidest hallucination of a deranged brain that you have reared
this structure of so many lying accusations against me. In fact all
this business is merely a childish farce; and I was quite right to
remain unmoved in the midst of you all, as an innocent woman in the
first place, and in the second place as a woman who was in no
danger. In spite of your airs of judges and torturers and in spite
of the enormous personal interest each of you has in success of
your common enterprise, you are at bottom honorable men who would
never dare to murder me. You would perhaps, Beaumagnan; because
you're a fanatic who lives in terror of me. But you would have to
find here executioners capable of obeying you. And there are none
here. Then what are you going to do? Imprison me? Shut me up in
some out-of-the-way corner. If that amuses you, do so. But you may
make up your minds that there is no cell from which I cannot escape
as easily as you can leave the room. So go now: judge me and
sentence me. For my part, I am not going to say another word."</p>

<p>She sat down, pushed up her veil, and setting her elbow on the
arm of the bench, rested her face on her hand. She had played her
part. She had spoken without any vehemence but with a profound
conviction, and in a few sentences, of a really irrefutable logic,
she had connected the accusation brought against her with this
inexplicable legend of longevity which was the keynote of the
affair.</p>

<p>In effect she had said: "It all holds together; and you
yourselves have been obliged to base your indictment on the story
of my adventures in the past. You had to start it with the
narration of events which go back a hundred years, to come to the
criminal actions of today. If I am mixed up in the latter it is
because I was the heroine of the former. If I am the woman you saw,
I am also the woman that my different portraits show you."</p>

<p>What were they to answer?</p>

<p>Beaumagnan was silent. The duel was ending in his defeat; and he
did not try to disguise it. Besides his friends no longer had the
implacable and harassed faces of men who find themselves forced to
the terrible decision of death. Doubt was stirring in them; Ralph
d'Andresy was distinctly conscious of it and he would have derived
some hope from it, if the memory of the preparations which Godfrey
d'Etigues and de Bennetot had made, had not lessened his
satisfaction. Beaumagnan and the Baron conversed in low voices for
a few moments; then Beaumagnan made his answer in the manner of a
man for whom the discussion was closed.</p>

<p>"You have before you, my friends, all the facts of the case," he
began. "The prosecution and the defense have said their last word.
You have seen with what genuine conviction Godfrey d'Etigues and
myself brought these charges against this woman and with what
subtlety she defended herself, entrenching herself behind an
inadmissible resemblance and so giving a striking example of her
resourcefulness and her infernal cunning. The situation then is
quite simple: an opponent of this strength of will and intelligence
and disposing of such resources, will never let us rest. Our task
is compromised. One after the other she will destroy us. Her
existence implies inevitably our ruin and destruction.</p>

<p>"Does that mean that there is no other solution but death and
that the punishment she deserves is the only one that we can
consider? It does not. Let her disappear, let her be unable to make
any fresh attempt. We have no right to demand more; and if our
consciences revolt against such an indulgent solution, nevertheless
we ought to be content with it because, when all is said and done,
we are not here to punish, but to defend ourselves. These then are
the arrangements we have made, subject to your approval. Tonight an
English ship will be cruising off the coast. A boat will be lowered
from it, and we shall row out to it and meet it at ten o'clock at
the foot of the Needle of Belval. We shall hand over this woman;
she will be taken to London, set ashore during the night, and shut
up in a madhouse until our task is accomplished. I do not think
that any of you will oppose this arrangement, which is not only
generous and humane but also makes our task safe and ourselves
secure against perils we should never escape."</p>

<p>Ralph perceived at once Beaumagnan's game and he thought to
himself: "That means death. There is no English ship. There are two
boats, of which one with a hole in its bottom will be towed out to
sea and sink. The Countess of Cagliostro will disappear without
anyone ever knowing what has become of her."</p>

<p>The duplicity of the scheme and the deceitful fashion in which
it had been set forth frightened him. Why should not the friends of
Beaumagnan agree to it when they were not even asked to answer in
the affirmative? Their silence sufficed. Let none of them make any
objection to it and Beaumagnan was free to act through his
intermediary, Godfrey d'Etigues. None of them did raise any
objection. <i>Without knowing it they had pronounced sentence of
death.</i></p>

<p>They all rose to go, manifestly delighted to have got out of the
business so cheaply. No one made any comment. They had the air of
leaving a gathering of friends at which they had discussed matters
of no moment. Some of them moreover had to catch a train at the
neighboring station. At the end of a couple of minutes they had all
of them gone except Beaumagnan and the two cousins. So it came
about in a fashion which Ralph found disconcerting that this
dramatic meeting in which a woman's life had been dealt with in
such an arbitrary manner and her death sentence obtained by so
odious a subterfuge, came to a sudden end, like a play the
dénouement of which is brought about before the logical moment,
like a trial in which sentence is pronounced in the middle of the
evidence.</p>

<p>This disingenuous juggling revealed to Ralph d'Andresy the
subtle and crafty nature of Beaumagnan with entire clearness.
Inexorable and a fanatic, ravaged by love and pride, the man had
decided on death. But there were in him scruples, cowardly
hypocrisies, confused fears, which obliged him, so to speak, to
hide himself from his own conscience and perhaps also from the eyes
of justice. Hence this dark solution of the difficulty, this free
hand obtained by this abominable trick. Now, standing on the
threshold, he was gazing at the woman who was about to die. Livid
and scowling, the muscles of his jaw twitching nervously, his arms
crossed, he had as usual the rather theatrical air of a romantic
personage. His brain must be teeming with tumultuous thoughts. Was
he hesitating at the last moment?</p>

<p>In any case his reflections did not last long. He gripped
Godfrey d'Etigues by the shoulder and drew him over the threshold,
flinging this order over his shoulder to de Bennetot as he went
out: "Guard her! And no nonsense! Understand? If there
is&mdash;"</p>

<p>During the departure of the conspirators and then of their
leaders the Countess of Cagliostro did not stir; and her face
preserved that thoughtful and serene expression which was so little
in keeping with the situation.</p>

<p>"Assuredly she has no suspicion of the danger that threatens
her," Ralph said to himself. "All that she is looking forward to is
confinement in a madhouse, and she is not worrying at all about the
prospect of that."</p>

<p>An hour passed; the shades of evening began to darken the
chamber. Twice the young woman looked at her watch. Then she tried
to enter into conversation with de Bennetot, and of a sudden her
face assumed an expression of incredible fascination and her voice
inflections that moved one like a caress.</p>

<p>De Bennetot grunted boorishly and did not answer.</p>

<p>Another half-hour passed; she looked round and then gazed at the
open door. It was quite clear that she had made up her mind that
flight was possible, that she was drawing herself together to
spring for the door. For his part, Ralph was trying to find some
method of helping her in the effort. If he had had a revolver he
would have made no bones about dropping de Bennetot. He thought for
a moment of jumping down into the chamber; but the opening of his
post of observation was too narrow. Besides some instinct seemed to
awake de Bennetot to the danger and he pulled out his revolver,
growling:</p>

<p>"A movement, a single movement, and I shoot. By God, I
will!"</p>

<p>He was a man to keep that oath. She did not stir.</p>

<p>Ralph, in a growing, torturing anxiety for her, gazed at her
untiringly.</p>

<p>Towards seven o'clock Godfrey d'Etigues returned, carrying a
traveling rug over his arm.</p>

<p>He lit a lamp and said to Oscar de Bennetot: "Get everything
ready. Go and fetch the stretcher. It's in the coach-house. Then
you can go and get some dinner."</p>

<p>When he was alone with the young woman the Baron appeared to
hesitate. Ralph saw that his face was haggard, his eyes wild, and
that he was on the point of speech or action. But the words or the
acts must have been of a kind from which one shrinks, for he was
for sometime restless and fidgeting. Then his opening was
brutal.</p>

<p>"Pray to God, Madam," he said suddenly.</p>

<p>She replied in a puzzled tone: "Pray to God? Why are you telling
me to do that?"</p>

<p>Then he said in a very low voice: "Do as you like...Only I must
warn you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Warn me of what?" she asked gazing at him in a sudden
anxiety.</p>

<p>"There are moments," he murmured, "when one ought to pray to God
as if one was about to die that very night."</p>

<p>She was stricken with a sudden panic. The facts of the situation
suddenly flashed on her. Her arms seemed to stiffen and she clasped
her hands in a kind of feverish convulsion.</p>

<p>"Die?...Die?...But there is no question of that, is
there?...Beaumagnan never spoke of death...He spoke of a
madhouse."</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>The unfortunate woman murmured:</p>

<p>"Heavens! He has deceived me. The madhouse was a lie...It's
something else...You're going to throw me into the sea. At
night...It's horrible! But it isn't possible...Me
die&mdash;me?...Help!...Help!"</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues caught up the traveling rug and with a furious
brutality he covered the young woman's head with it and pressed his
hand over her mouth to smother her cries. As he was doing so, de
Bennetot returned carrying the stretcher on his shoulder. The two
of them stretched her out on it and tied her down securely and in
such a way, that through an opening between the slats, there hung
down the iron ring to which a heavy boulder was to be fastened.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch4" id="ch4"></a>4. The Sinking Boat</h2>

<p>The darkness was thickening. Godfrey d'Etigues lit a lamp. Oscar
de Bennetot went to the château to get some dinner. He must have
made a hasty meal, for he was back in about a quarter of an hour.
The two cousins settled down to the death vigil. Even in that dim
light Ralph could see that their faces were sinister. He could see
the nervous twitchings which the thought of the crime so near at
hand provoked.</p>

<p>"You ought to have brought a bottle of rum," growled Oscar de
Bennetot. "There are occasions on which one had better not perceive
too clearly what one is doing."</p>

<p>"This is not one of them," said the Baron coldly. "On the
contrary, we shall need to have all our wits about us."</p>

<p>"It's a nice business," growled de Bennetot.</p>

<p>"Then you ought to have argued it out with Beaumagnan and
refused him your help," said the Baron impatiently.</p>

<p>"It was impossible," murmured de Bennetot.</p>

<p>"Then obey," said the Baron sternly.</p>

<p>The time passed slowly. No sound came from the château or from
the sleeping countryside.</p>

<p>Once de Bennetot rose, went to their prisoner, and bending down,
listened. Then he turned to the Baron and said:</p>

<p>"She is not even groaning. She certainly is a woman of
character."</p>

<p>He went back to his chair and added in a low voice in which
there was a note of fear: "Do you believe all these things they say
about her?"</p>

<p>"What things?"</p>

<p>"About her age?...And all those stories of bygone days?"</p>

<p>"They're rubbish!" said the Baron scornfully. "Beaumagnan
believes in them at any rate."</p>

<p>"Who knows what Beaumagnan believes, or what he doesn't?" said
the Baron impatiently.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless you must admit, Godfrey, that it's an infernally
odd business...and that everything goes to show that she was not
born yesterday."</p>

<p>"Yes: that is so," murmured Godfrey d'Etigues.</p>

<p>"For my part, when I read that paper Beaumagnan drew up, I spoke
to her as if she really had been living all those years ago."</p>

<p>"Then you do believe it?"</p>

<p>"More or less. But stop talking about it. I've already had a
good deal more than I bargained for in getting mixed up in this
affair. If I had only known what it meant before I started on it, I
swear to you&mdash;" he raised his voice&mdash;"I would have
refused to have anything to do with it, and made no bones about it.
Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off short. The subject was in the highest degree
distasteful to him and he did not wish to say a word more about
this infinitely painful business.</p>

<p>But de Bennetot went on: "Yes, and I swear to you that for two
pins I'd clear out now; and all the more, look you, because I've a
notion that Beaumagnan has us all nicely hooked. As I told you
before he knows a lot more about the business than we do; and we're
just puppets in his hands. One day or other, when he no longer has
any need of us, he'll bid us a fond farewell and we shall see that
he has worked the whole business for his own advantage. I'd bet on
it. However&mdash;"</p>

<p>Godfrey put his finger to his lip and murmured: "Be quiet. She
can hear you."</p>

<p>"What does that matter?" said de Bennetot. "In a little while
she'll&mdash;"</p>

<p>The words died away on his lips; and they seemed no longer to
dare to break the silence. Every quarter of an hour the clock of
the village church chimed. Ralph fancied he could see their lips
move as they counted the strokes, gazing fearfully at one another
without saying anything.</p>

<p>But when that clock struck ten, Godfrey d'Etigues banged his
fist down on the table with a violence that made the lamp
jingle.</p>

<p>"Hell take it! It's time we started."</p>

<p>"What a disgusting job it is!" growled de Bennetot. "Are we
going by ourselves?"</p>

<p>"The others want to come with us. But I shall send them back
from the top of the cliff, since they believe in that English
ship," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"I should much prefer that we went in a body," said de
Bennetot.</p>

<p>"Oh, be quiet! My instructions are that only you and I are to
handle the matter. The others might get talking; and that would be
a pretty kettle of fish. Hullo! Here they are!"</p>

<p>The others turned out to be the three who had not taken the
train, that is to say d'Ormont, Rufus d'Estiers, and Rolleville.
The latter was carrying a stable lamp which the Baron made him
extinguish.</p>

<p>"No lights," he said. "Somebody would see it moving about on the
cliff and start gossiping about it. Have the servants gone to
bed?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Rufus d'Estiers. "And Clarice?"</p>

<p>"She must be upstairs. We haven't seen anything of her," said
Rolleville.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, she's a little out of sorts today," said
the Baron. "Let's be getting off."</p>

<p>D'Ormont and Rolleville took the handles of the stretcher. They
crossed the park and then a field to the lane which led from the
village to the priest's staircase. The starless sky was black with
heavy clouds; and in the darkness the little procession,
practically feeling its way, stumbled over ruts and banks. Curses
kept slipping out; the Baron d'Etigues angrily hushed them.</p>

<p>"Will you stop that noise, confound you!" he muttered savagely.
"Somebody will recognize our voices!"</p>

<p>"Who will recognize our voices, Godfrey? There's absolutely
nobody about, for you took your precautions with regard to the
coastguards," de Bennetot protested.</p>

<p>"Yes, they're safe enough. They're at the inn, guests of a man I
can rely on. Nevertheless it's just possible that a patrol is
making its round."</p>

<p>There came a depression in the plateau which the road followed.
Then it rose again; and they made their way as best they might to
the spot at which the staircase rose to the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>It had been hollowed out of the cliff many years before on the
suggestion of a priest of Benouville, in order that the country
people might descend to the beach. It was lighted by openings cut
through the chalk. Through them there were magnificent views of the
sea, whose waves were dashing against the rocks below, and into
which one seemed to be on the point of plunging.</p>

<p>"It's going to be a difficult job, to get that stretcher down
those steps," said Rolleville. "We'd better help you. At any rate
we can light the staircase for you."</p>

<p>"No," said the Baron with decision. "It is wiser to separate. So
back you get."</p>

<p>The three of them obeyed without further protest. The Baron
lighted a bull's-eye lantern; and without any delay the two cousins
set about the difficult task of getting the stretcher down the
staircase.</p>

<p>It proved a long job. The steps were steep and the turnings in
the cliff were sometimes so narrow that they were compelled to
raise the stretcher right on end to get it round them. The little
lamp afforded but a feeble light that illumined but a few steps at
a time.</p>

<p>De Bennetot soon lost his temper, and to such a degree that with
the natural brutality of a badly brought up boor he proposed simply
to "chuck the whole thing down," that is to say, to push the
unfortunate girl, litter and all, through one of the openings in
the chalk.</p>

<p>At last they reached the beach, which was composed of a fine
gravel, and stopped to recover their breath. A little way off two
boats were drawn up side by side. The sea, quite calm, unruffled by
the smallest wave, lapped against their keels. De Bennetot pointed
out the hole he had made in the bottom of the smaller of the two,
which for the time being was closed by a kind of stopper of straw.
They set the stretcher on the three thwarts.</p>

<p>"Let's tie the whole lot together," said Godfrey d'Etigues.</p>

<p>De Bennetot made a very sensible objection; he said: "And if
ever there's a search, and this boat and stretcher and girl are
found tied together at the bottom of the sea, this stretcher will
prove damned awkward evidence against us."</p>

<p>"We've got to go far enough out to make it impossible for anyone
to recover anything ever," said the Baron. "Besides it's an old
stretcher which hasn't been used for the last twenty years. I
routed it out from a loft full of lumber. There's nothing to fear
from that."</p>

<p>He spoke in a shaky, fearful voice that de Bennetot hardly
recognized.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Godfrey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The matter with me? What should be the matter with me?"
muttered the Baron more than a trifle indistinctly.</p>

<p>"Then?..."</p>

<p>"Then shove the boat down into the water...But first of all,
according to the instructions of Beaumagnan, we've got to remove
her gag and ask her if there is any last wish she wants carrying
out. You'd better get it over."</p>

<p>"Me?" de Bennetot almost howled. "Me touch her? Me see her? I'd
rather die!...Suppose you do it!"</p>

<p>"I couldn't...I'll be damned if I could," murmured the Baron
huskily.</p>

<p>"But she's guilty...She committed those murders."</p>

<p>"Of course...Of course...At least it's probable that she
did...The only thing is she looked such a gentle creature."</p>

<p>"Yes," said de Bennetot. "And she's so pretty&mdash;as beautiful
as the Virgin."</p>

<p>With one accord they fell on their knees on the pebbles and
started to pray aloud for the girl who was about to die and on
whose behalf they called for "the intervention of the Virgin
Mary."</p>

<p>Godfrey mingled verses from the burial service with prayers and
de Bennetot punctuated them at intervals with fervent amens. This
appeared to restore their courage a trifle, for they suddenly rose,
burning to get the business over.</p>

<p>De Bennetot brought the great boulder he had ready, and tied it
firmly to the iron ring. They pushed the boat down the beach into
the still water. Then, together, they pushed the other boat down
the beach and clambered into it. Godfrey took the two oars while de
Bennetot tied the painter of the boat of the doomed woman to the
last thwart of the boat they were in, then shipped the rudder.</p>

<p>So they rowed out to sea to the quiet accompaniment of dripping
oars. Shadows darker than the night allowed them to make their slow
way safely between lowering rocks towards the open sea. But, at the
end of twenty minutes, their progress grew slower and slower; and
they came to a stop.</p>

<p>"I can't go any further," said the Baron in a faint voice. "My
arms have given out. It's your turn."</p>

<p>"I couldn't move her a yard," de Bennetot protested with
manifest sincerity.</p>

<p>Godfrey made another attempt and gave it up.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he said. "Surely we've got far enough out and
to spare. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"Of course we have," said de Bennetot quickly&mdash;"especially
since there's a breeze from the shore which will take the boat
further out still."</p>

<p>"Then pull that straw out of the hole."</p>

<p>"You've got to do that," protested de Bennetot, to whom the act
seemed the very act of murder.</p>

<p>"Enough of that nonsense!" growled the Baron savagely, "Get on
with it!"</p>

<p>De Bennetot pulled on the painter. The other boat came slowly up
alongside, its gunwale rubbing the gunwale of the boat they were
in. He had only to lean over to lay his hand on the straw.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid G-G-Godfrey," he stammered. "By my eternal
salvation, it is not I who do this, but you. Understand that."</p>

<p>Godfrey growled like a wild beast, sprang forward, thrust him
aside, bent over the gunwale, and tore the bolt of straw out of the
hole.</p>

<p>There came a gurgle of rising water; and it upset him to such a
degree that, in a sudden revulsion of feeling, he wished to stop up
the hole again.</p>

<p>He was too late, de Bennetot had slipped into his seat and taken
up the oars. Recovering all his strength in an access of panic at
that sinister sound, he pulled with such violence that a single
stroke drove their boat several fathoms from the other.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted the Baron. "Stop! I wish to save her! Stop!
Curse you!...It's you who are killing her, not me!...Murderer! I
would have saved her!"</p>

<p>But de Bennetot, mad with terror, incapable of hearing or of
understanding, was plying the oars with a fury that threatened to
break them.</p>

<p>The corpse, for what else could one call this inert creature,
helpless and doomed to death in that scuttled boat, remained alone.
The sea must inevitably fill the boat in a few minutes, and it must
sink beneath the waves.</p>

<p>Godfrey realized that. Therefore, making the best of it, he took
the other pair of oars, and without caring whether anyone heard the
splashes or not, the two confederates strove with the most
desperate efforts to escape with the utmost possible speed from the
scene of their crime. They dreaded to hear some faint cry of
anguish or the terrible murmur of an object that sinks and over
which the water closes forever.</p>

<p>The doomed boat floated almost without movement on the surface
of the sea, on which the air, loaded with low clouds, appeared to
weigh with an extraordinary heaviness.</p>

<p>D'Etigues and de Bennetot must have been halfway back to the
shore. The sound of their flight was no longer heard. At that
moment the boat heeled over to starboard; and in a kind of stupor
of terror and agony that dazed her, the young woman thought that
the end had come. She did not wince; she did not shiver. The
acceptance of death produces a state of mind in which one seems
already on the other side of the grave.</p>

<p>However she was faintly astonished not to feel the touch of icy
water. At the moment it was the thing from which her delicate flesh
most shrank. No; the boat was not plunging under. It seemed more
likely rather to capsize because somebody had passed a leg over the
gunwale. Somebody? But who? The Baron? His confederate?</p>

<p>She learned that it was neither the one nor the other, for a
voice which she did not know murmured:</p>

<p>"You can stop being frightened. It's a friend who has come to
rescue you."</p>

<p>This friend bent over her and without even knowing whether she
heard or not, continued: "You have never seen me...my name is
Ralph...Ralph d'Andresy...It's all right now...I've stopped the
hole with a stocking rolled round one of the rowlocks. It's a
makeshift; but it will work all right&mdash;especially since we are
going to get rid of this great boulder."</p>

<p>With his knife he cut the ropes which fastened the young woman
to the stretcher, cut loose the boulder, and succeeded in heaving
it overboard.</p>

<p>Then drawing aside the folds of the rug which enveloped her, he
said:</p>

<p>"You can't think how delighted I am things have turned out so
much better than I expected. Here you are, safe! The water has not
even had time to reach you. What luck we've had! You're feeling all
right?"</p>

<p>She whispered so low that he hardly heard it:</p>

<p>"No...My ankle...Their ropes twisted my foot and cut into
it."</p>

<p>"That will soon be all right," he said. "The important thing is
to get back to the shore. Your two executioners will have certainly
landed by now and must be scrambling up the staircase as hard as
they can climb. So we have nothing to fear from them."</p>

<p>He got to work quickly. He took the two oars, which de Bennetot
had not taken the trouble to remove&mdash;unless perhaps he had
thought that if the boat were found it would look less suspicious
if the oars were in it&mdash;and began to row towards the shore,
telling her how he had come to her help in the nick of time, in a
cheerful, careless voice, as if nothing more extraordinary had
happened than happens at an ordinary picnic.</p>

<p>"Let me introduce myself in a rather more formal way, though I'm
not particularly presentable at the moment, since I am only dressed
in my shirt, one stocking, and a knife hanging from a string from
my neck," he said. "I am Ralph d'Andresy, at your
service&mdash;since chance willed it. And a very simple chance it
was...I overheard a conversation...I learned that there was a plot
in action against a certain lady. So I took the liberty of
forestalling it. I hurried down to the beach, undressed, and when
the two cousins came out of the entrance of the tunnel I slipped
into the water. All I had to do then was to hide behind your boat
and catch hold of the stern when they started to tow it out to sea.
And that was what I did do. Neither of them had the slightest idea
that they were taking out with their victim a champion swimmer who
had made up his mind to save her. But I'll tell you more about it
later when you're in a state to understand. I've got an idea that
at the moment I'm babbling away to the empty air."</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I'm feeling very ill," she murmured. "I'm utterly worn
out."</p>

<p>"I can tell you what to do," he said quickly. "Lose
consciousness. Nothing is so restful as to lose consciousness."</p>

<p>She seemed to follow his advice, for after a little moan or two,
she began to breathe quietly and regularly. He covered her up with
the rug and fell to rowing again.</p>

<p>"It's better as it is," he said to himself. "I can act exactly
as I like without having to explain what I'm doing."</p>

<p>The fact that there was no one to listen to him did not prevent
him from indulging in a sustained monologue, with all the
satisfaction of a man who is exceedingly pleased with himself and
everything he does. The boat moved quickly towards the shore. The
dark mass of the cliffs loomed ahead.</p>

<p>When the keel of the boat ground its way into the pebbles, he
jumped out of it, then lifted the unconscious young woman, with an
ease which demonstrated the uncommon strength of his muscles, and
carried her to the foot of the cliff.</p>

<p>"Boxing champion also," said he&mdash;"to say nothing of the
Greco-Roman style. I don't mind telling you, since you cannot hear
me, that I found these useful accomplishments in my inheritance
from father...and a jolly lot of others! But enough of this
trifling. Rest here, under this rock, where you're safe from the
treacherous waves...I shall be back presently. I expect you will be
very keen on taking vengeance on those two cousins. That makes it
necessary that the boat should not be found and that they should
believe you thoroughly and completely drowned. So do not be
impatient."</p>

<p>Without wasting any more time he put this plan into execution.
Once more he rowed out the boat to the open sea, pulled out the
rowlock and his stocking out of the hole, and, sure that it would
sink, took to the water again. As soon as he reached the shore, he
put on his clothes which he had hidden in a cranny in the
cliff.</p>

<p>He went back to the young woman and said: "Come, the next job is
to climb to the top of the cliff; and it's not the easiest job in
the world."</p>

<p>Little by little she came out of her swoon and he saw faintly
the glimmer of her open eyes.</p>

<p>With his help she tried to stand upright, but uttered a cry of
pain, and would have fallen but for his arm. He lowered her to the
ground, took off her shoe, and found that her stocking was all
bloody. It was in no way a serious injury, but uncommonly painful.
He used his handkerchief as a temporary bandage. They had to be
getting on their way; and he hoisted her on to his shoulder and
began the ascent of the staircase.</p>

<p>Three hundred and fifty steps! If Godfrey d'Etigues and Oscar de
Bennetot had had great difficulty in carrying, the two of them, the
young woman down, what an immense effort was demanded by the
ascent, and that from a young man! Four times he had to stop,
streaming with sweat, feeling that he would never be able to go on.
Nevertheless he went on, all the while with a cheerfulness no
fatigue could dash. At the third halt, having sat down with the
girl on his knee, he found that she was laughing faintly at his
jokes and unflagging spirit. At last he finished the ascent with
her charming form hugged tightly to him, his hands and his arms
assuring him of its supple firmness.</p>

<p>When he reached the top he gave himself but the shortest rest,
for a fresh breeze had risen and was clearing the sky. Fortunately
they had no great distance to go to find security; and with a last
brisk effort he carried her across a field into a lonely barn which
he had had in mind all the while. He carried her up the ladder into
the loft, laid her on a heap of straw, covered her with the rug,
told her that she was safe and need fear nothing and that he would
soon be back. Then he closed the trap-door, unhooked the ladder,
hid it under straw, and hurried to the sleeping inn. With cat-like
quietness he filled a basket with some cold meat, cheese, bread, a
bottle of wine, a bottle of water, and a lantern. He was soon back
at the barn, climbed up into the loft with his basket, drew up the
ladder, and shut the trapdoor.</p>

<p>"Twelve hour's sleep and safety!" he said in a tone of
satisfaction. "No one will disturb us here. At noon tomorrow I'll
get a carriage for you and take you wherever you like."</p>

<p>Here they were then, shut up together after the most tragic and
marvellous adventure that one could imagine. How far away it all
seemed now&mdash;all those dreadful scenes of the day! The tribunal
of enquiry, the inexorable judges, the sinister executioners,
Beaumagnan, Godfrey d'Etigues, the condemnation, the descent down
to the sea, the boat sinking in the darkness, what nightmares
already dim! They had come to an end in an intimate comradeship of
victim and rescuer.</p>

<p>By the light of the lantern hanging from a beam he gave the
young woman food and drink and dressed her wound with infinite
gentleness. Protected by him, far from the snares and hatred of her
enemies, Josephine Balsamo lay back in utter trustfulness. She shut
her eyes and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The lamp illumined clearly her beautiful face, flushed by the
fever of so many emotions. Ralph knelt down in front of her and
contemplated her at length. Finding the heat of the barn
oppressive, she had unfastened the top of her bodice; and he could
see her admirably shaped shoulders and the purity of the line where
they joined the neck.</p>

<p>He bethought himself of that black mark of which Beaumagnan had
spoken, and which was plain to see in the miniature. How could he
have resisted the temptation to make sure if it were really there
on the bosom of the woman he had saved from death? Gently he drew
down the top of her frock. Low down on her right shoulder a beauty
spot, black as one of those <i>mouches</i> which coquettes used
formerly to stick at the corner of their lips, marked the white and
silky skin and rose and fell with the even rhythm of her
breathing.</p>

<p>"Who are you? Who are you?" he murmured, greatly troubled. "From
what world do you come?"</p>

<p>He too, like the others, was conscious of an inexplicable
discomfort; like them felt the mysterious impression that emanated
from this strange creature, accentuated by those curious details of
her life and by her astonishing beauty. And he could not help
questioning her as if she were able to answer on behalf of the
woman who had, those long years, before been the model of the
miniature.</p>

<p>Her lips formed words which he did not understand. And he was so
near to them and the breath they breathed forth was so sweet that,
trembling like a leaf, he brushed them with his own.</p>

<p>She sighed. Her eyes opened. At the sight of Ralph on his knees
before her she blushed and at the same time smiled; and this smile
still wreathed her lips when her heavy eyelids had come down again
over her eyes and she had sunk back into her slumber.</p>

<p>Ralph was distracted; quivering with passionate admiration,
Clarice utterly forgotten, he murmured the most exalted phrases and
clasped his hands as before an idol to which he was addressing a
hymn of the most ardent and frenzied adoration.</p>

<p>"Oh, how beautiful you are!...I did not think there was so much
beauty in the world...Do not go on smiling...I can quite understand
that men desire to make you weep&mdash;your smile is so
troubling...One would like to efface it so that no one might ever
see it again. Ah, do not smile at anyone but me, I implore
you!"</p>

<p>Then in a lower voice and even more passionately he
continued:</p>

<p>"Josephine Balsamo. How sweet your name is! And how much more
mysterious it makes you! Did Beaumagnan call you a witch?...He was
wrong. You're an enchantress...You have emerged from the darkness
and you're the light&mdash;the light of the sun!...Josephine
Balsamo...Enchantress...Magician!...What a world opens before
me!...What a wealth of happiness I see...My life began at the very
moment at which I took you in my arms. I have no other memories but
the memory of you...All my hope is in you...Heavens how beautiful
you are!...It is enough to make one weep with despair."</p>

<p>He uttered these impassioned words, leaning over her, his mouth
close to her mouth; but the kiss he had stolen was the only caress
he allowed himself. There was not only a voluptuousness in the
smile of Josephine Balsamo, but also such a modesty that he felt a
profound respect for her; and his exaltation ended in the words of
genuine gravity, full of juvenile devotion.</p>

<p>"I will help you...The rest of the world shall be able to do
nothing against you...If you desire to reach, in spite of them, the
goal at which they are aiming, I promise you that you shall
succeed...Far from you or near you, I shall always be your defender
and savior. Trust in my devotion."</p>

<p>At last he went to sleep, murmuring promises and oaths which had
become rather incoherent; and it was a profound and dreamless sleep
like the sleep of children who have to restore their overdriven
young organizations.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The church clock struck eleven. He counted the strokes with a
growing surprise.</p>

<p>"Eleven o'clock in the morning! Is it really possible?" he
cried.</p>

<p>The light was filtering in through the chinks in the shutters
and through openings under the old thatched roof. On the right,
even, a ray of sunlight fell on the floor.</p>

<p>"Where are you?" he said in a dazed voice. "I do not see
you."</p>

<p>The lamp had been extinguished. He sprang to the shutters and
pulled them open. A flood of light filled the loft; but it did not
reveal Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>He sprang upon the trusses of hay and in a childish fury flung
them aside. No one. Josephine Balsamo had disappeared. He hurried
down from the loft, hunted through the park, fairly ransacked the
plateau and the road. In vain. In spite of the injury to her foot
which had, the night before, made it impossible for her to set it
on the ground. She had left their hiding place, crossed the park
and the plateau and got away...</p>

<p>He returned to the barn to make a minute inspection of it. He
did not have to seek long. He saw on the floor a rectangular piece
of cardboard.</p>

<p>He picked it up. It was the photograph of the Countess of
Cagliostro. On the back of it, written in pencil, were these two
lines:</p>

<p class="letter">"My rescuer has all my gratitude,<br>
but he must not try to see me again."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>5. One of the Seven Branches</h2>

<p>There are certain stories the hero of which passes through the
most extravagant adventures and on the very edge of the dénouement
awakes to find that it has all been the mirage of a dream.</p>

<p>When Ralph found his bicycle behind the bank where he had hidden
it two nights before, he suddenly had the idea that he had been
tossed about in a series of dreams, pleasant, picturesque,
terrifying, and, above all, wholly deceptive. He did not cherish
the hypothesis for any length of time. The photograph which he had
in his possession, and even more perhaps the intoxicating kiss that
he had snatched from the lips of Josephine Balsamo, set everything
on the firm ground of reality. That at any rate was a certainty
from which there was no getting away.</p>

<p>At this moment for the first time&mdash;he admitted it with a
touch of quickly passing remorse&mdash;his thoughts returned to
Clarice d'Etigues and to the delightful hours of the morning
before.</p>

<p>But at Ralph's age these ingratitudes and these sentimental
contradictions are easily dealt with. It appears that one is
divided into two beings, the one of whom will continue to love in a
kind of unconsciousness, with a love that is to play its part in
the future, while the other abandons himself with frenzy to all the
transports of the new passion. The image of Clarice rose before
him, troubled and grief-stricken, as if at the back of the little
chapel, lighted by flickering candles beside which he would from
time to time go and pray. But the Countess of Cagliostro had at
once become the unique divinity of his adoration, a despotic and a
jealous divinity, who would not suffer one to rob her of the least
thought, or the least secret.</p>

<p>Ralph d'Andresy&mdash;so we will continue to call the young man
who, later, under the name of Arsène Lupin became so
illustrious&mdash;Ralph d'Andresy had never loved. As a matter of
fact he had been prevented from doing so by lack of time rather
than by lack of opportunity. Burning with ambition, but not knowing
in what sphere and by what means his dreams of glory, of fortune,
and of power would be realized, he spent his energy in every
direction in order to be ready to answer on the instant the call of
destiny. His intelligence, his ingenuity, his will, his agility,
the strength of his muscles, his suppleness, and his endurance, he
cultivated all his gifts to the extreme limit, always astonished to
discover that this limit ever receded further before the violence
of his efforts.</p>

<p>With all this, however it was necessary to live, for he had no
resources. An orphan, alone in the world, without friends or
relations, without a profession, somehow or other he managed to
live. How? It was a matter about which he could only give somewhat
hazy explanations which he himself did not examine too closely. One
lives as best one can. One deals with one's needs and one's
appetite as circumstances permit. And there again he was astonished
to perceive the richness of his aptitudes and the favorable
opportunities that Fortune always seemed to bring him.</p>

<p>"The luck is on my side," he told himself. "Forward then. What
will be will; and I have an idea that it will be magnificent."</p>

<p>It was at this point that he crossed the path of Josephine
Balsamo. He perceived at once that, to win her, he would freely
spend all the energy he had accumulated. His ambitions? He knew
their goal for the future&mdash;Josephine Balsamo. Of a sudden he
learned the reason of his existence and the significance of his
preparations&mdash;Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>And for him Josephine Balsamo had nothing in common with the
"infernal creature" whom Beaumagnan had endeavored to raise before
the troubled imagination of his friends. All that vision of
bloodshed, those accoutrements of crime, those trappings of the
sorceress, vanished like a nightmare in face of the charming
photograph in which he contemplated the limpid eyes and pure lips
of the young woman.</p>

<p>"I shall find you!" he swore, covering it with kisses. "And you
shall love me as I love you. To me you shall be the most submissive
and the most adored of mistresses. If you have loved, you shall
forget those you have loved; you shall pursue them with your hate.
I shall read your mysterious life as one reads an open book. Your
power of divination, the miracles you work, your incredible youth,
everything which troubles and frightens the rest of the world,
shall be so many ingenious devices at which we shall laugh
together. Josephine Balsamo, you shall be mine!"</p>

<p>It was an oath he was resolved to keep; but he fully realized
its extravagance and the audacity at the moment. In the bottom of
his heart, he was still frightened of Josephine Balsamo, and he was
not so far from feeling a certain irritation against her, like a
child who wishes to be the equal but finds himself the obedient
inferior of someone stronger than himself.</p>

<p>For two days he confined himself to the little bedroom which he
occupied on the ground-floor of the inn, the window of which looked
out on a courtyard planted with apple trees. They were days of
meditation and waiting. On the afternoon of the third he took a
long ride through the plain of Normandy, that is to say to the
places where it was possible that he would meet Josephine Balsamo.
He thought it quite unlikely that the young woman, still badly
shaken by her horrible experiences, would return to her abode in
Paris. Alive, it was necessary that those who had murdered her
should believe her dead. Moreover not only to avenge herself on
them but also to reach before them the goal that they were seeking,
it was necessary that she should not leave the field of battle. And
that field of battle was the region which they call the Caux
country; and in it all the ends of intrigue seemed to be united. In
that case why should he not suddenly see her charming figure round
the corner of this or that road, or on the outskirts of this or
that wood?</p>

<p>When he came back that evening he found on his dressing-table a
bunch of spring flowers, periwinkles, narcissi, primroses, and wild
strawberry blossoms. He asked the landlord how they came there. No
one had been seen in his room.</p>

<p>"It is she!" he thought, kissing the flowers that she had just
gathered.</p>

<p>For four consecutive days he posted himself under cover at the
back of the courtyard. When he heard the sound of a footstep
nearby, his heart jumped. Always he was disappointed. It caused him
keen suffering. But at five o'clock on the fourth day, among the
trees and bushes which covered the slope down the courtyard, he
heard the rustling of a gown. Among them he saw a gown. He was on
the point of darting forward, when he stopped short, overwhelmed by
a sudden access of rage. He saw that it was Clarice d'Etigues.</p>

<p>She had in her hand a bunch of flowers exactly like the other
one. She crossed the courtyard lightly to the window of his bedroom
and putting her hand through it set those flowers on his
dressing-table.</p>

<p>When she retraced her steps, he had a clear view of her face and
was struck by its paleness. Her cheeks had lost their fresh
coloring and her sunken eyes were witness to the bitterness of her
grief and her hours of sleeplessness.</p>

<p>"You will make me suffer bitterly," she had said.</p>

<p>She had not foreseen however, that those sufferings would begin
so soon and that the very day which had seen their love at its
zenith, would be a day of fare well and of inexplicable
desertion.</p>

<p>He remembered the prediction and raging at her for the injury he
was doing her, furious at his disappointment, that it had been
Clarice who had brought the flowers and not she for whom he was
waiting, he suffered her to go away without a word.</p>

<p>However it was to Clarice&mdash;to Clarice who thus herself
destroyed her last chance of happiness&mdash;that he owed the
precious information which he needed to find his way in the
darkness in which he was moving. An hour later he discovered that a
letter was fastened to the bouquet. He tore it open and read:</p>

<p>"Is it already finished, dearest? No: it cannot be. There is no
real reason for my tears surely?...It is impossible that you should
have already had enough, of your Clarice?</p>

<p>"Darling tonight they are all going away by train; and they will
not come back till very late tomorrow. You will come, won't you?
You will not leave me to weep again?"</p>

<p>Poor, mournful lines!...Ralph was not softened by them. He
considered this journey of which she told him and remembered that
accusation of Beaumagnan: "Learning from me that we were soon about
to examine from cellar to roof a mansion near Dieppe, she betook
herself there hastily&mdash;"</p>

<p>Was not this the goal of the expedition? And would he not find
there an opportunity of joining in the struggle and drawing from it
all the advantage that circumstances might offer?</p>

<p>That very evening at seven o'clock, dressed like a fisherman
from the coast in blue flannel trousers, a thick woolen sweater,
and a woolen cap pulled down over his ears, unrecognizable under
the layer of ochre which reddened his face, he got into the same
train as the Baron d'Etigues and Oscar de Bennetot, like them
changed twice, and got out at a little village where he spent the
night.</p>

<p>Next morning d'Ormont, Rolleville, and Rufus d'Estiers came in a
carriage to fetch their two friends. Ralph followed them.</p>

<p>At the end of ten kilometers the carriage stopped before a long,
dilapidated mansion called the Château de Gueures. When he came to
the open gates, Ralph discovered that a whole host of workmen were
swarming in the gardens and park, digging up the paths and the
lawns, or scraping the basin of a pool which was fed by a small
stream of which they had closed the sluice-gates. It was ten
o'clock. On the terrace the contractors welcomed the five
associates.</p>

<p>Ralph entered without being noticed, mingled with the workmen,
and questioned them. From them he learned that the château had just
been bought by the Marquis de Rolleville and that the work of
restoration had begun that morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, Monsieur. Instructions have been given that any man who in
the course of his digging finds coins, metal objects, copper, iron,
and so forth, is to hand them over and he will be rewarded."</p>

<p>It was quite clear that all this turning things upside down had
no other object than the discovery of something. Ralph asked
himself what they were trying to find.</p>

<p>He strolled round the park, made a tour of the mansion, hunting
through the cellars with especial care, without discovering
anything of a nature to solve the problem, the data of which he did
not know. It is all very well to seek but it is necessary to know
what you are seeking.</p>

<p>At half-past eleven he had arrived at no result of any kind; and
the necessity of doing something was impressing itself on his mind
more and more strongly. Every delay gave the others greater and
greater chances; and he risked finding himself confronted by the
accomplished fact.</p>

<p>At that moment the five friends were standing on a long terrace
behind the mansion, a terrace which looked down on the park and the
lake. A small balustrade ran along the edge of it, broken at
regular intervals by twelve brick pillars which served as pedestals
for old stone vases, nearly every one of which was broken.</p>

<p>A gang of workmen armed with picks set about demolishing the
wall. Ralph watched them do it thoughtfully, his hands in his
pockets and a cigarette between his lips, without bothering himself
about the fact that his presence on that spot might appear a trifle
strange.</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues rolled a cigarette; and then having no
matches, he walked up to Ralph and asked him for a light.</p>

<p>Ralph held out his cigarette and while the Baron was lighting
his, a complete plan formed itself in his mind, a spontaneous, very
simple plan, of which the least details rose before him in their
logical sequence.</p>

<p>He pulled off his cap and displayed his carefully brushed curls
which were not at all those of an ordinary fisherman. The Baron
d'Etigues gazed at him earnestly, and, suddenly enlightened, fell
into a fury.</p>

<p>"You again! And disguised! What is this new intrigue and how
dare you follow me here? I've already told you in the clearest
possible terms that a marriage between my daughter and you is
impossible."</p>

<p>Ralph caught his arm and said imperiously:</p>

<p>"We don't want a scandal! That would do neither of us any good.
Bring your friends to me."</p>

<p>Godfrey tried to shake him off.</p>

<p>"Bring your friends!" Ralph repeated in a yet more imperious
voice. "I am going to render you a service. What are you looking
for? Something antique, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Baron impressed against his will by Ralph's
earnestness. "We're looking for a candlestick."</p>

<p>"A candlestick with seven branches, of course that's what it is!
I know its hiding-place. Later I shall be able to give you other
information which will be useful to you in the work you have taken
in hand. Then we'll talk about Mademoiselle d'Etigues. Today there
is no question of her. Call your friends!"</p>

<p>Godfrey hesitated; but Ralph's confident promises impressed him.
He called to his friend and they came at once.</p>

<p>"I know this young man," he said in a grudging voice. "And
according to him we shall perhaps succeed in finding&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ralph cut him short.</p>

<p>"There's no perhaps about it, Monsieur," he said impatiently. "I
belong to this part of the country. And when I was a boy, I used to
play in this château with the children of an old gardener who was
the caretaker of it. One day he pointed out to us a ring affixed to
the wall of one of the cellars and said: 'That's a hiding-place
that is. I've often been told of how they put valuables into
it&mdash;gold candlesticks and clocks and jewelry.'"</p>

<p>These revelations made the Baron and his friends open their
eyes. De Bennetot however raised an objection.</p>

<p>He said: "But we've already searched the cellars."</p>

<p>"Not thoroughly," Ralph declared. "I'm going to show you."</p>

<p>They made for the cellars by the quickest way, a staircase at
the end of the left wing which descended to the basement from the
outside of the building. Two large doors opened on to three or four
steps, after which came a series of vaulted chambers.</p>

<p>"The third on the left," said Ralph, who, in the course of the
tour he had made through them, had studied the ground. "Here...this
one."</p>

<p>He made them all precede him, through a door so low that they
had to stoop to enter it, into a dark cellar.</p>

<p>"You can't see an inch before your face," grumbled Rufus
d'Estiers.</p>

<p>"That's true," said Ralph. "But here are some matches and I saw
a candle-end on one of those steps into the cellars. Half a
minute&mdash;I'll run for it."</p>

<p>He shut the door of the cellar, turned the key quietly, took it
out of the door, and called out to his prisoners:</p>

<p>"Mind you light all the seven branches of the candlestick. You
will find it under the last slab carefully wrapped up in spiders'
webs!"</p>

<p>Before he got outside the building he heard the five of them
hammering furiously at the door. He was sure that, worm-eaten and
shaky, it would hold out but a very few minutes. But that was all
the time he wanted.</p>

<p>He rushed up on to the terrace. A workman was demolishing the
fourth of the little brick pillars. Ralph took his pick from him,
saying:</p>

<p>"Hand it over, mate. The proprietor has just told me what to
do."</p>

<p>"Shall I help you?" said the workman.</p>

<p>"There's no need, thanks."</p>

<p>Ralph hurried to the ninth pillar, and knocked the vase off it
with a stroke of his pick. Then he attacked the top of the pillar,
which was covered with cracked cement, which fell to pieces under
his blows. Under the cement cap the pillar was hollow, and the
hollow had been filled with earth and pebbles. Ralph started to
clear them out quickly with the point of his pick. And about a foot
down it turned up a piece of corroded metal. A glance showed him
that it was veritably a branch of one of those great candlesticks
one sees on the altars of many churches.</p>

<p>A group of workmen had gathered round him and at seeing this
piece of metal which Ralph picked up and waved in the air, they
cheered. It was the first discovery that had been made since they
began work.</p>

<p>Doubtless Ralph would have kept his head and gone quietly off,
pretending that he was going to find the five friends to give them
this metal stem; but at that very moment there was a loud shouting
at the corner of the building, and Rolleville, followed by the rest
of the five, came bucketing round it, bellowing:</p>

<p>"Thief! Arrest him! Thief!"</p>

<p>Ralph dived through the group of workmen and took to his heels.
It was absurd, like the rest of his conduct for the last few
minutes, for if he had wished to win the confidence of the Baron
and his friends he should not have shut them up in a cellar and
robbed them of the object of their search. But since he was really
fighting for Josephine Balsamo, he had no other idea in his head
but that of offering her sooner or later the trophy he had just
acquired.</p>

<p>Since the main road to the gates was blocked by workmen, he ran
round the lake, knocked down two men who tried to bar his way and
followed, at a distance of thirty yards, by a veritable horde of
pursuers howling like mad men, ran into a small kitchen garden,
surrounded on every side by a wall of a most discouraging
height.</p>

<p>"Confound it!" he muttered. "I'm well shut in! I'm going to be
the stag at bay, hang it!...What a mull I've made of it!"</p>

<p>Above the left wall of the kitchen garden rose the village
church and the graveyard ran right into the interior of the garden
in the shape of a small enclosed space, which formerly served as a
burial ground of the lords of Gueures. Tall yew trees hung over its
wall. As he ran round this enclosure a small door in the wall was
half opened, an arm was stretched out to bar his way, a little hand
seized him by the arm; and the astonished Ralph was drawn into a
dark arch way by a woman who shut the door in the face of his
pursuers, and turned the key in the lock.</p>

<p>He divined rather than saw Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>"Come on!" she said, plunging into the middle of the yews.</p>

<p>Another door was opened in the opposite wall of the little
close; it let them into the village churchyard.</p>

<p>By the apse of the church stood an old-fashioned barouche of the
kind one hardly ever sees nowadays anywhere except in the country.
Harnessed to it were two thin, badly groomed horses. On the box sat
a gray-bearded coachman whose bent back stuck out under his blue
blouse.</p>

<p>Ralph and the Countess jumped into the carriage. No one had seen
them. She said to the coachman:</p>

<p>"Take the road to Luneray and Doudeville. Be quick!"</p>

<p>The church was at the end of the village; and by taking the road
to Luneray, they avoided passing any of the cottages. A long
stretch of road rose in a steepish hill to the plateau. The two
lean steeds developed the speed of first-class trotters and went up
the hill at an astonishing pace.</p>

<p>The interior of this shabby-looking barouche was spacious,
comfortable, and protected from the eyes of the indiscreet by
shutters of wooden trellis-work. Indeed it conveyed such an
impression of intimacy that Ralph fell on his knees and gave vent
freely to his amorous exaltation.</p>

<p>He was choking with joy. Whether the Countess was offended or
not, he decided that this second meeting, taking place in such
extraordinary circumstances and after the night of the rescue,
established relations between them which permitted him to omit
several stages and begin the conversation with a formal declaration
of love.</p>

<p>He did so at once and in an airy fashion which would have
disarmed the most prudish of women.</p>

<p>"You? Is it indeed you? But how dramatic! At the very moment at
which the hunt was going to tear me to pieces, Josephine Balsamo
springs from the shadows and rescues me in my turn. Ah, how happy I
am! How I love you! I have loved you for years...for a hundred
years! Yes, I've a hundred years of love in me...An old love as
young as you. And as beautiful as you are lovely!...And you are so
lovely!...One cannot look on you without being moved to the depths
of one's being...It's a joy; but at the same time it fills one with
despair to think that, whatever happens, one will never be able to
grasp your beauty in all its fullness. Your expression, your smile,
their deepest meanings will forever elude us."</p>

<p>He quivered and murmured: "Oh, your eyes rest on me! You do not
turn them away! You're not angry with me then? You allow me to tell
you of my love?"</p>

<p>"Suppose I bid you get out?" she said, opening the door.</p>

<p>"I should refuse."</p>

<p>"And if I were to call the coachman to my aid?"</p>

<p>"I should kill him."</p>

<p>"And if I got out myself?"</p>

<p>"I should continue the declaration of my love along the
road."</p>

<p>She burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"You have an answer for everything," she said. "Stay where you
are; but no more nonsense! Tell me what happened to you and why
those men were pursuing you."</p>

<p>He had gained his end.</p>

<p>"Yes, I will tell you everything since you do not repulse
me...Since you accept my love."</p>

<p>"But I accept nothing," she said, still laughing. "You pile
declaration on declaration and you do not even know me."</p>

<p>"I don't know you?"</p>

<p>"You hardly saw me that night&mdash;just by the light of a
lantern."</p>

<p>"And didn't I see you during the day before that night? Didn't I
have time to admire you during that abominable ordeal at La Haie
d'Etigues?"</p>

<p>She turned suddenly serious and gazed at him earnestly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you were present, were you?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"I was there, all right," he said with triumphant cheerfulness.
"I was there; and I know who you are. Daughter of Cagliostro, I
know you! You can drop your mask. The first Napoleon played with
you...You betrayed Napoleon III, helped Bismarck, and drove the
brave General Boulanger to suicide! You bathe in the fountain of
youth. You are a hundred years old&mdash;and I love you."</p>

<p>Her brow was furrowed with a faint frown of troubled doubt.</p>

<p>"Ah, you were there...I guessed as much...The brutes! How they
did make me suffer!...And you heard their hateful accusations?" she
said slowly and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I heard a lot of stupid things," he exclaimed. "And I saw a
band of fanatics who hate you as they hate everything that is
beautiful. But all that was imbecile and silly. Don't let's think
any more about it. For my part, I only wish to remember the
delightful miracles which spring up before your feet like flowers.
I wish to believe in your everlasting youth. I wish to believe that
you would not have died if I had not rescued you. I wish to believe
that my love is supernatural and that it was by enchantment that
you issued just now from the trunk of a yew."</p>

<p>She shook her head gently, serene again.</p>

<p>"No: to visit the Château de Gueure I had already passed through
that ancient door, the key of which was in the lock; and knowing
that they were going to make a great search this morning I was on
the watch," she said. "I saw them hunting you from the gate of that
garden. You were coming to it. I slipped back and waited."</p>

<p>"A miracle, I tell you!" he declared. "And here is another. For
weeks and months, perhaps for longer, they have searched in that
park for a candlestick with seven branches. And to find it in a few
minutes in the midst of all that crowd and under the very eyes of
our opponents, it was only necessary for me to wish to please
you."</p>

<p>She started and stared at him with amazed eyes: "What? What are
you talking about?...You've found it?" she cried.</p>

<p>"The candlestick itself: no&mdash;only one of its seven
branches. Here it is."</p>

<p>She almost snatched the bronze metal branch from him and
examined it almost feverishly. It was round, fairly strong,
slightly bent, and the metal of it was hidden by a thick layer of
verdigris. One of its ends, a little blackened, had let into one of
its faces a large violet stone, rounded <i>en cabochon</i>.</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, "yes: there is no possible doubt about it.
The branch has been sawed off level with the main stem. You've no
idea how grateful I am to you!"</p>

<p>In a few picturesque sentences he gave her an account of his
exploit. She could not get over her astonishment.</p>

<p>"But what gave you the idea? Why that inspiration to demolish
the ninth pillar rather than another? Was it mere chance?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Not at all," he declared. "It was a certainty. Eleven out of
the twelve pillars had been built before the end of the seventeenth
century&mdash;the ninth, later."</p>

<p>"How did you know?" she asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Because the bricks of the eleven others are of a size that has
not been in use for the last two hundred years, while the bricks of
number nine are those which are in use today. Therefore number nine
was demolished and then rebuilt. Why, if not to hide this branch of
the candlestick?"</p>

<p>She was silent for a good minute. Then she said slowly:</p>

<p>"It's extraordinary...I should never have believed it possible
to succeed...And so quickly! There, where we had all failed...Yes:
it really was a miracle."</p>

<p>"Love's miracle," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The carriage sped along with astonishing rapidity, keeping to
cross-country lanes, it avoided the passage through villages. Up
hill and down dale the ardor of those two little thin horses never
flagged. On either side the country passed like images in a
dream.</p>

<p>"Was Beaumagnan there?" asked the Countess.</p>

<p>"Luckily for him he was not," said Ralph with a darkling
air.</p>

<p>"Why luckily?"</p>

<p>"If he had been, I should have strangled him," said Ralph
between his teeth. "I hate the gloomy dog."</p>

<p>"Not so much as I do," she said bitterly.</p>

<p>"But you haven't always hated him," said he unable to hide his
jealousy.</p>

<p>"Lies and calumnies," said Josephine Balsamo coldly, without
raising her voice. "Beaumagnan is an impostor, an unbalanced
creature, full of morbid pride; and it is because I rejected his
love that he desired my death. That I said the other day; and he
did not contradict me...He could not contradict me."</p>

<p>"But what joyful words!" exclaimed Ralph. "Then you never loved
him? What a weight off my spirits! But, after all, the thing was
impossible! Josephine Balsamo to fall in love with a
Beaumagnan!"</p>

<p>He laughed aloud in his joy.</p>

<p>"But listen, I do not wish to call you that any longer," he went
on. "Josephine is not a pretty name. Let me call you Josine. May I?
That's it, I will call you Josine, as Napoleon and your mother
Josephine Beauharnais called you Josine. That's settled, isn't it?
You are Josine...my Josine."</p>

<p>"Respect first, please," she said smiling at his childishness.
"I am not your Josine."</p>

<p>"Respect! But I'm overflowing with respect. What! We were shut
up together...You were entirely defenseless...And I remained on my
knees before you as before an idol. And I'm full of fear! I'm
trembling! If you were to give me your hand to kiss I should not
dare to do it!"</p>

<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>6. Detectives and Policemen</h2>

<p>The journey was one long protestation of love. Perhaps the
Countess of Cagliostro was right not to put Ralph to the test by
holding out her hand for him to kiss. But in truth, though he had
sworn an oath to win that charming young woman and was resolved to
do so, he felt for her a respect which left him just enough courage
to ply her with amorous words, and no more.</p>

<p>Did she hear him? For a while, yes&mdash;as one listens to a
child telling you prettily how fond he is of you. Then she sank
into a profound thoughtful silence which disconcerted him.</p>

<p>At last he cried:</p>

<p>"Speak to me, I implore you. I speak jokingly in order to be
able to tell you things that I should not dare to tell you
seriously. But, at heart, I'm afraid of you; and I do not know what
I am saying. Answer me, I beg you. Say just a few words that will
recall me to reality."</p>

<p>"Only a few words?" she said slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, just a few."</p>

<p>"Well, then, here they are: Doudeville Station is quite near;
and the railway is waiting for you."</p>

<p>He crossed his arms with an air of indignation.</p>

<p>"And you?" he said.</p>

<p>"I?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What is going to become of you all by yourself?"</p>

<p>"Goodness!" she said quickly. "I shall try to get on as I've
been getting on up to now."</p>

<p>"That's impossible. You cannot do without me any longer. You
have entered upon a struggle in which my help is indispensable.
Beaumagnan, Godfrey d'Etigues, the Prince of Arcola are so many
ruffians who will crush you."</p>

<p>"They believe me dead."</p>

<p>"That's all the more reason for letting me join forces with you.
If you are dead how do you wish to act?"</p>

<p>"Don't let that worry you. I shall act without their seeing me,"
she said confidently.</p>

<p>"But how much more easily through me as your agent! No; I beg
you&mdash;and now I am speaking very seriously&mdash;do not reject
my aid. There are things which a woman cannot accomplish by
herself. Owing to the mere fact that you, a woman, are seeking the
same end as these men and are consequently at war with them, they
have succeeded in forming the most ignoble plot against you. They
brought such charges against you and supported them by proofs
apparently so sound that for a moment I actually saw in you the
sorceress and criminal whom Beaumagnan was overwhelming with his
hatred and contempt. Do not be angry with me for that. As soon as
you began to defend yourself against them, I saw my mistake.
Beaumagnan and his confederates became nothing more than your
hateful and cowardly executioners. You dominated them by your
dignity; and today not a vestige of all their calumnies lingers in
my memory. But you must accept my help. If I have ruffled your
sensibilities by telling you that I love you, you will hear no more
about that. All I ask for is to be allowed to devote myself to you,
as one concentrates oneself to that which is most beautiful and
purest."</p>

<p>She yielded to his earnest pressure. They drove on through
Doudeville. A little further on, on the road to Yvetot, the
carriage turned into a farmyard, along the edge of which ran a row
of beeches which seemed to be stunting the apple trees with which
it was planted, and came to a stop.</p>

<p>"Here we get out," said the Countess. "This place belongs to
Mother Vasseur, an excellent woman who was once my cook. She keeps
an inn a little way down the road. Sometimes when I want a rest I
come and stay with her for a day or two. We will lunch here,
Leonard, and be off again in an hour."</p>

<p>She and Ralph turned into the high road again. She walked with
the light step of a young girl. She was wearing a tightly-fitting
gray frock and a mauve hat, with velvet strings, and trimmed with
bunches of violets. Ralph walked a little behind her in order to
feast his eyes on her.</p>

<p>Round the first corner they found a small white house with a
thatched roof; in front of it was a small flower-garden. They
stepped right into the bar which ran the length of the house.</p>

<p>"A man's voice," said Ralph doubtfully, nodding towards the door
of a room on the other side of the bar.</p>

<p>"That's the room in which Mother Vasseur always gives me my
meals," said the Countess. "I expect some of the villagers are in
it."</p>

<p>On her words the door of it opened and a woman well on in years,
wearing an apron and sabots, came out of it.</p>

<p>At the sight of the Countess she appeared utterly flabbergasted,
shut the door sharply behind her and stuttered something they could
not understand.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" said Josephine Balsamo in a tone of
anxiety.</p>

<p>Mother Vasseur dropped into a chair and murmured more
clearly:</p>

<p>"Be off!...Bolt!...Be quick!"</p>

<p>"But why? Explain?" said the Countess.</p>

<p>The old woman got control of herself and said:</p>

<p>"Detectives...They're hunting for you...They've searched your
trunks...They're expecting the policemen from the town...Run away,
or you're lost!"</p>

<p>The Countess tottered, and looking as if she were about to
faint, leaned against the bar. Her eyes met Ralph's in a
supplication. It was for all the world as if she thought that she
was lost and begged him to help her.</p>

<p>Ralph was stupefied. He stammered:</p>

<p>"B-b-but what d-d-do the police matter to you? It isn't you
they're looking for!...Why on earth&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes! It is her!" said Mother Vasseur. "They are looking
for her!...Save her!"</p>

<p>Without grasping the full significance of this astonishing
scene, Ralph divined that here was something in the nature of a
tragedy. He caught the Countess by the arm, drew her to the door,
and thrust her through it.</p>

<p>But crossing the threshold first, she started back in affright
and cried:</p>

<p>"The police! They have seen me!"</p>

<p>The two of them hastily stepped back into the house. Mother
Vasseur was trembling in every limb; she muttered stupidly:</p>

<p>"The police...the detectives."</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" snapped Ralph in a low voice, keeping quite calm.
"I'll answer for its being all right. How many detectives are
there?"</p>

<p>"Two."</p>

<p>"And two policemen. Then it's no use trying force; and we're
surrounded. Where are those trunks they've searched?"</p>

<p>"Upstairs."</p>

<p>"Where's the staircase to them?"</p>

<p>"Here," she said, pointing to the door on the right.</p>

<p>"Right. You stay here; and don't give yourself away. Once more I
tell you, I'll answer for its turning out all right."</p>

<p>Again he took the Countess by the arm and drew her towards the
door Mother Vasseur had pointed out. A very narrow staircase
brought them to a bedroom under the sloping roof. About it were
spread all the frocks and lingerie which the detectives had turned
out of two trunks. As they came into it they heard the two
detectives come out of the room in which they had been lunching,
into the bar; and when Ralph, crossing the room on noiseless feet,
peered out through the window under the eaves, he saw the two
policemen dismount and tie the reins of their horses to the posts
of the garden gate.</p>

<p>The Countess did not stir. Ralph noticed that her face, haggard
with fear and anxiety, had perceptibly aged.</p>

<p>"Quick!" he said sharply. "You must change that frock. Put on
another...a black one for choice."</p>

<p>He returned to the window; and while she changed watched the
detectives and the policemen talking in the garden and tried to
catch what they were saying. When she had changed, and she was
quick about it, he caught up the grey frock she had just taken off
and slipped into it. For all his strength, he was uncommonly
slender, with a lissom figure. The frock fitted him to perfection;
the long skirt of the period, when he had pulled it down hard, hid
his feet passably; and he appeared to be so delighted with this
disguise and so easy in his mind that the young woman began to
recover her confidence.</p>

<p>The voices of the police in the garden rose higher, and they
could hear what they were saying.</p>

<p>"Listen," he said.</p>

<p>The four men were standing at the garden gate. One of the
policemen said in the rough drawling voice of the countrymen:</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that she stayed here occasionally?"</p>

<p>"Quite sure. And the proof of it is that there are two trunks of
hers which she has left in storage here. One of them has her name
painted on it&mdash;Madam Pellegrini. Besides, Mother Vasseur is a
respectable woman, isn't she?" said one of the detectives.</p>

<p>"There isn't a more respectable woman than Mother Vasseur in
this part of the country," said the policeman.</p>

<p>"Well, Mother Vasseur declares that this Madam Pellegrini has
been in the habit of coming from time to time to stay with her for
a day or two."</p>

<p>"Between two burglaries, you bet!"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"Then it would be a feather in our caps to capture this Madam
Pellegrini?"</p>

<p>"It would indeed&mdash;larceny&mdash;swindling&mdash;receiving
stolen goods&mdash;the whole bag of tricks in fact&mdash;and a
swarm of confederates," said one of the detectives.</p>

<p>"Have they got a description of her?" asked the policeman.</p>

<p>"Yes and no," replied the detective.</p>

<p>"Yes and no?"</p>

<p>"They have two portraits of her which are entirely different.
One is the portrait of a young woman, the other of an old one. As
to her age, it is set as between thirty and sixty."</p>

<p>They laughed; then the rough voice of the country policeman went
on: "But you're on her track?"</p>

<p>"Again yes and no. A fortnight ago she was working at Rouen and
Dieppe. There we lost track of her. We found it again on the main
line and lost it again. Did she go straight on to le Havre or turn
off towards Fécamp? It is impossible to say. She has completely
disappeared and left us floundering," said the detective.</p>

<p>"And what made you come here?"</p>

<p>"Just a chance. A railway porter who brought trunks here on a
truck remembered that the name of Pellegrini was painted on one of
them, and that it had been hidden under a label which came
unstuck."</p>

<p>"Have you questioned any other travelers who stay at the inn?"
asked the country policeman.</p>

<p>"Oh, precious few people stay here."</p>

<p>"What about the lady we caught sight of just now as we rode up
to the inn?"</p>

<p>"A lady?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a lady. She just came out of this door and went straight
in again. It rather looked as if she wanted to avoid us."</p>

<p>"A lady? In this inn? It isn't possible!"</p>

<p>"A lady in gray. She was too far off for us to be able to
recognize her face again. But we saw her gray dress; and she is
wearing a hat with flowers in it."</p>

<p>"The devil she is!" cried the detective. "We must look into
this!"</p>

<p>They said no more, but there came the ominous clumping of large
police boots along the flagged path of the garden.</p>

<p>During this conversation Ralph and the young woman had listened
without uttering a word, staring at one another. As these new facts
came to his ears, Ralph's face had grown darker and darker. She
made no attempt to rebut them.</p>

<p>"They're coming...They're coming," she said in a hushed
voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. They're coming; and we must be doing, or else they'll come
upstairs and find you here," he said calmly.</p>

<p>As he spoke he snatched up her hat from the toilet table, put it
on his head, pulled down the brim a little and tied the strings
under his chin to hide yet more of his face. Then he gave her his
final instructions.</p>

<p>"I'm going to clear the way for you," he said. "As soon as it is
clear, you will walk quietly along the road to the farmyard where
your carriage is waiting. Get into it, and see that Leonard has the
reins in his hands."</p>

<p>"But what about you?" she said.</p>

<p>"I'll be with you in twenty minutes."</p>

<p>"But suppose they arrest you?"</p>

<p>"They won't arrest me, or you either," he said confidently. "But
no hurry, mind you. Don't run down the road. Keep cool."</p>

<p>He stepped to the window and leaned out of it. The four men were
on the point of entering the house. He slipped over the sill and
dropped into the garden, uttered a cry as if he had just caught
sight of them, and dashed off at full speed.</p>

<p>They yelled with one voice.</p>

<p>"Hi! The woman in gray!...It's her!...Halt! Or I'll fire!"</p>

<p>He crossed the road in one stride, jumped into the ploughed
field on the other side of it, raced across it, and sideways up a
slope to a farm. Then came another slope, then some fields; then he
ran into a lane which skirted another farm and had a thick,
quickset hedge on both sides of it.</p>

<p>He stopped short. He had outdistanced his heavily-booted
pursuers considerably. He was out of their sight behind that thick
hedge. In a jiffy he pulled off the hat, stripped off the frock,
and thrust them well down into the bottom of the overgrown ditch.
Then he put on his fisherman's cap, lit a cigarette, stuck his
hands in his pockets, and went back the way he had come.</p>

<p>At the corner of the farm two breathless, bucketting detectives
nearly ran into him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, fisherman! Have you met a woman&mdash;a woman in
gray?"</p>

<p>"Yes...A woman who was running, you mean?...A regular madwoman,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's her!...Which way did she go?"</p>

<p>"She went into the farm."</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Through the back gate."</p>

<p>"How long ago?"</p>

<p>"Not more than a couple of minutes."</p>

<p>The two men ran on. Ralph continued his descent of the slope,
gave the policemen, who were struggling up it, a friendly greeting,
walked briskly down to the ploughed field and across it, struck the
road a little below the inn, close to the corner.</p>

<p>A hundred yards round it were the beeches and apple trees of the
farmyard where the carriage awaited him.</p>

<p>Leonard was on the box, whip in hand. Josephine Balsamo, inside
the carriage, held the door open.</p>

<p>Ralph said to Leonard: "Drive along the road to Yvetot."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the Countess. "But it takes us past the inn!"</p>

<p>"The essential thing is that they should not guess that we came
out of this place. If we go round the corner toward Yvetot, they
will not know where we came from. Just a gentle trot,
Leonard...about the pace of a hearse returning empty from a
funeral."</p>

<p>Leonard shook the reins, the horses trotted quietly round the
corner along the road, past the inn. On its threshold stood Mother
Vasseur. She just threw out her right hand sideways in a gesture of
greeting and farewell and turned and went inside.</p>

<p>"That sets her mind at rest, poor old thing," said the Countess.
"Look!"</p>

<p>Against the skyline, up by the farm, stood the four policemen,
conferring. From the liveliness of their gestures it was clear that
they were not of the same opinion. They had drawn the farm blank
and were debating what to do next.</p>

<p>"That's all right," said Ralph. "The carriage is the last thing
they'll connect with your flight, for they believe that you're
somewhere on the other side of that hill. In fact, they'd simply
laugh if anybody told them you were in it."</p>

<p>"They're going to question Mother Vasseur pretty severely," said
the Countess.</p>

<p>"She'll have to get out of it as best she can. We can't help
her," he said with decision.</p>

<p>When they had passed out of sight of the policemen, he bade
Leonard drive faster.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the poor beasts will not go much further. How long
have they been going already?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Since this morning, when we left Dieppe. I spent the night
there."</p>

<p>"And where are we going to?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The banks of the Seine."</p>

<p>"Goodness! Between forty-five and fifty miles in a day, at this
pace! But it's a marvel!"</p>

<p>She did not say anything.</p>

<p>Between the two front windows of the carriage there was a strip
of glass in which he could see her. She had put on a darker frock
and a light toque from which a fairly thick veil hung down over her
face. She pushed up the veil and took from the shelf fixed under
the strip of glass a small leather bag which contained an old, gold
hand-glass, and other toilet appurtenances, small, stoppered
bottles, rouge, and brushes.</p>

<p>She took the hand-glass from it and gazed at her tired face in
it for some time.</p>

<p>Then she poured some drops on it from a tiny crystal bottle and
rubbed the wetted surface with a scrap of silk. Once more she
looked at herself in the glass.</p>

<p>At first Ralph did not understand; he only observed the somewhat
bitter and melancholy expression of a woman gazing at herself when
she is not at her best.</p>

<p>Ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, passed in this silence and in
the manifestly intense effort of that gaze in which all her thought
and will were concentrated. The smile appeared first, hesitating,
timid, like a ray of winter sunlight. Presently it became bolder
and revealed its action by little details which presented
themselves in turn to the astonished eyes of Ralph. The corner of
the mouth lost its droop. The skin filled again with color. The
flesh appeared to grow firm again. The cheeks and the chin
recovered their pure outline; and all the grace of youth once more
illumined the beautiful and tender face of Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>The miracle was accomplished.</p>

<p>"Miracle?" said Ralph to himself. "Not a bit of it. Or rather,
to be exact, a miracle of the will. The influence of a clear and
tenacious thought which refuses to accept decay, and which
reestablishes discipline where disorder and surrender reign. As for
the rest the mirror, the little bottle, the wonderful
elixir&mdash;just a comedy."</p>

<p>He took the hand-glass, which she had set down beside her, and
examined it. It was evidently the hand-glass described during the
meeting of the conspirators at La Haie d'Etigues, that which the
Countess of Cagliostro had used in the presence of the Empress
Eugenie. The frame was engine-turned, the plate of silver at the
back was all dented with blows.</p>

<p>On the handle was a count's coronet, a date, 1783, and the list
of the four enigmas.</p>

<p>Urged by a veritable, painful need to wound her, he said with a
sneer: "Your father indeed left you a precious mirror. Thanks to
its talismanic power one recovers from the most disagreeable
emotions."</p>

<p>"It's a fact that I lost my head," she said quietly. "That
doesn't happen to me often. I've kept it in far more serious
situations than that one."</p>

<p>"Oh come&mdash;more serious?" he said in a tone of incredulous
irony.</p>

<p>She did not protest; and for a long while they did not exchange
another word. The horses continued to trot with the same even brisk
rhythm. The great plains of Caux, always alike and always
different, unfolded vast vistas set with farms and woods. The
Countess had lowered her veil. Ralph felt that this woman, who had
been so close to him two hours before, to whom he had so joyfully
offered his devotion, was drawing slowly and slowly away from him,
becoming more and more a stranger. There was no longer any contact
between them. That mysterious soul was sinking back into the dark
depths in which it belonged; what he had seen of it was so
desperately different from what he had dreamed.</p>

<p>The soul of a thief...a furtive restless soul, hostile to the
light of day. Was it indeed possible? How could he admit that this
face of a simple, innocent girl, that those eyes, clear as the
waters of a virgin spring, were a mirage and a lie?</p>

<p>He had sunk to such a depth of disillusionment that, as they
passed through the little village of Yvetot, he thought of nothing
but flight. But he lacked the energy to fly; and that redoubled his
anger. The memory of Clarice d'Etigues rose in his mind; and in a
kind of revengefulness, he summoned up before it the clear image of
the gentle young girl whose selfless abandonment had been so
noble.</p>

<p>But Josephine Balsamo did not loose her prey. However tarnished
she might appear to him, however deformed the idol might have
grown, she was there! An intoxicating fragrance emanated from her.
He was touching her. With a movement he could take her hand and
kiss that perfumed flesh. She was all the passion, all the desire,
all the voluptuousness, all the troubling mystery of woman; and
once more the memory of Clarice vanished from his mind.</p>

<p>"Josine&mdash;Josine," he murmured so low that she did not hear
him.</p>

<p>Moreover, what was the use of bemoaning his love and his
suffering? Would she restore to him the confidence he had lost and
regain in his eyes the prestige which was hers no longer?</p>

<p>They were drawing near the Seine. On the top of the slope which
runs down to the river at Caudebec they turned to the left, among
the wooded hills which dominate the valley of Saint-Wandrille. They
drove along the ruins of the celebrated abbey, followed the course
of the water which bathes the foot of its walls, came in sight of
the river, and took the road to Rouen.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the carriage stopped. They stepped out of
it; and Leonard drove on again, leaving them on the outskirts of a
little wood from which they looked across the river. A meadow
covered with waving reeds ran between it and them.</p>

<p>Josephine Balsamo held out her hand:</p>

<p>"Goodbye, Ralph. A little further on you will find Mailleraie
Station."</p>

<p>"But what about you?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I? My abode is close at hand."</p>

<p>"I don't see it."</p>

<p>"Yes, you do: that barge which you can just see between the
branches."</p>

<p>"I'll take you to it."</p>

<p>A narrow embankment ran across the meadow through the middle of
the reeds. The Countess took her way along it, followed by
Ralph.</p>

<p>So they came to a piece of open ground, close by the barge,
which was still hidden behind a curtain of willows. No one could
see them or hear them. They were alone under the expanse of blue
sky. And there there passed some of those minutes of which one
keeps the memory for a lifetime and which influence the whole
course of one's destiny.</p>

<p>"Goodbye," said Josephine Balsamo once more.</p>

<p>He hesitated before this hand stretched out to him in final
farewell.</p>

<p>"Won't you shake hands with me?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes...yes..." he murmured. "But why should we separate?"</p>

<p>"Because we no longer have anything to say to one another," she
said sadly.</p>

<p>"Nothing indeed; and yet we never have said anything," said
he.</p>

<p>He took her warm and supple little hand in his and said:</p>

<p>"What those men said?...Their accusations in the garden of that
inn?...Was it true?"</p>

<p>He craved some explanation, lie though it might be, which should
permit him to retain some doubt.</p>

<p>But with an air of surprise she answered: "What on earth does
that matter to you?"</p>

<p>"What? Of course it matters to me!" he cried.</p>

<p>"One might really imagine that those revelations could have some
effect on you," she said looking at him with just a suspicion of
mockery in her expression.</p>

<p>"What on earth do you mean?" he said in astonished accents.</p>

<p>"Goodness! It's very simple. I mean to say that I could have
understood your being shocked at the confirmation of the monstrous
crimes of which Beaumagnan and the Baron d'Etigues so falsely and
stupidly accused me; but there is no longer any question of
them."</p>

<p>"But I haven't forgotten their accusations either," he said.</p>

<p>"Their accusations against the woman whose name I gave them,
against the Marquise de Belmonte. But it is not a question of
crimes at all. What does all that chance revealed to you a little
while ago really matter to you?"</p>

<p>He was taken aback by this unexpected question. She looked him
straight in the face, smiling, entirely at her ease, and went on a
trifle ironically:</p>

<p>"Doubtless the Vicomte Ralph d'Andresy has had his sensibilities
ruffled? The Vicomte Ralph d'Andresy must evidently have moral
principles, and the delicate sentiments of a gentleman."</p>

<p>"And supposing he has?" said he. "When I experienced that
disillusionment&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Steady on!" she said sharply. "You've let the cat out of the
bag! You're disappointed. You ran after a beautiful dream and it
all vanished, now that the woman appears to you exactly as she is.
Answer frankly since we are honestly trying to get things clear.
You're disappointed, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," he said dryly.</p>

<p>They were silent. She gazed deep into his eyes and murmured:</p>

<p>"I'm a thief, am I not? That's what you mean, isn't it? A
thief?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She smiled and said: "And what about you?"</p>

<p>And as he started back she caught him firmly by the arm, tried
to shake him, and cried imperiously:</p>

<p>"Yes, what about you, my young friend? What are <i>you</i>? The
time has come for you to lay your cards on the table also. Who are
you?"</p>

<p>"My name is Ralph d'Andresy."</p>

<p>"Rubbish! Your name is Arsène Lupin. Your father Theophrastus
Lupin, who combined the occupation of professor of boxing and
gymnastics with the more lucrative profession of crook, was
convicted and imprisoned in the United States, and died there. Your
mother resumed her maiden name and lived as a poor relation at the
house of a distant cousin, the Duke of Dreux-Soubise, One day the
Duchess discovered that jewels of the greatest historical value,
nothing less, in fact, than the famous necklace of Queen Marie
Antoinette, had disappeared. In spite of the most exhaustive
attempts to discover it no one ever knew who was the author of this
theft, executed with a diabolical daring and cleverness. But I, I
do know. It was you. You were six years old."</p>

<p>Ralph listened, pale with anger and grinding his teeth.</p>

<p>He muttered. "My mother was unhappy and humiliated. I wished to
set her free."</p>

<p>"By thieving?"</p>

<p>"I was six years old," he protested.</p>

<p>"Today you're twenty; your mother is dead; you're robust,
intelligent, and overflowing with energy. How do you make a
living?"</p>

<p>"I work!" he snapped.</p>

<p>"Yes: in other people's pockets."</p>

<p>She gave him no time to deny it.</p>

<p>"You needn't say anything, Ralph," she went on quickly. "I know
your life down to the last details. And I could tell you things
about yourself that would astonish you, things that happened this
year, and things that happened years ago. For I've been following
your career for a very long time and the things I should tell you
would certainly not be a bit more pleasant hearing than the things
you heard not so very long ago at the inn. Detectives? Policemen?
Inquiries? Prosecutions?...You've been perfectly well acquainted
with them, quite as well acquainted with them as I am, and you're
not twenty! Is it really worthwhile for us to reproach one another?
Hardly. Since I know your life and since chance has uncovered for
you a corner of mine, let us throw a veil over both. The act of
theft is not a pretty one. Let us turn away our eyes and say
nothing about it."</p>

<p>He remained silent. A great weariness invaded him. All at once
he saw existence in a gloomy and depressing light in which nothing
any longer had color, nothing beauty or graciousness. He could have
wept. She paused, frowning thoughtfully and rather sadly, then she
said: "Well, for the last time, goodbye."</p>

<p>"N-n-no...N-n-no!" he stammered.</p>

<p>"But it must be goodbye, Ralph. I should only do you harm. Do
not try to mingle your life with mine. You have ambition, energy,
and such qualities that you can choose your path."</p>

<p>She paused and said in a lower voice: "The path I follow is not
a good one, Ralph."</p>

<p>"Why do you follow it, Josine? That's exactly what frightens
me."</p>

<p>"It's too late to find another," she murmured.</p>

<p>"Then it's too late for me too!"</p>

<p>"No: you're young. Save yourself. Fly from the fate with which
you are threatened."</p>

<p>"But you, Josine...But you?"</p>

<p>"It's my life," she declared.</p>

<p>"A dreadful life, which simply causes you suffering," he
asserted.</p>

<p>"If you think so, why do you wish to share it?"</p>

<p>"Because I love you."</p>

<p>"All the more reason to fly from me, my dear. Any love between
us is damned beforehand. You would blush for me; and I should
distrust you."</p>

<p>"I love you," he persisted.</p>

<p>"Today. But tomorrow? Obey the order I gave you on my photograph
the very first night we met: 'Do not seek to see me again.' Now
go."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said slowly. "Yes. You're right. But it's terrible to
think that everything is at an end between us before even I have
had the time to hope...and that you will forget me."</p>

<p>"One does not forget a person who has saved one's life
twice."</p>

<p>"No: but you will forget that I love you."</p>

<p>She shook her head and said: "I shall not forget."</p>

<p>Then with a thrill of emotion in her tone she went on more
quickly: "Your enthusiasm, your initiative...everything that is
sincere and spontaneous in you...and other qualities that I have
not yet had time to discover in you...all that touches me
profoundly."</p>

<p>Their two hands were still clasped; their eyes still gazed into
one another. Ralph was quivering with tenderness.</p>

<p>She sighed and said gently: "When one says goodbye forever, one
is bound to return one another's gifts. Give me back my portrait,
Ralph."</p>

<p>"No, no! Never!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Then I," she said with a smile which intoxicated him, "I shall
be more honest than you and honestly give back to you the gift you
gave me."</p>

<p>"But what gift?" he asked, for he could remember no gift.</p>

<p>"The first night...in the barn...while I was sleeping...you
leaned over me; and I felt your lips."</p>

<p>She bent towards him, put her arms round his neck, drew his head
towards her, and their mouths met.</p>

<p>"Oh, Josine!" he cried, lost. "Do what you like with me. I love
you...I love!"</p>

<p>They walked along the bank of the Seine, the waving reeds below
them. They brushed against the long narrow spears shaken by the
breeze. They went towards happiness with no other thoughts in their
hearts but those which make lovers, walking hand in hand,
tremble.</p>

<p>"One word, Ralph," she said, suddenly stopping short. "I feel
that with you I shall be violent and exacting. Is there another
woman in your life?"</p>

<p>"Not one," he said firmly.</p>

<p>"A lie already!" she said bitterly.</p>

<p>"A lie?"</p>

<p>"What about Clarice d'Etigues? You used to meet her in the
fields. You were seen together."</p>

<p>He was a trifle ruffled, and he said sharply: "That's an old
story...The merest flirtation."</p>

<p>"You swear it?"</p>

<p>"I swear it."</p>

<p>"All the better," she said with a somber air. "All the better
for her. And let her never come between us! If she does&mdash;"</p>

<p>He drew her along, protesting: "I love you only, Josine! I have
never loved anyone but you. My life begins today."</p>

<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>7. The Delights of Capua</h2>

<p>The <i>Nonchalante</i> was a barge in no way distinguished from
any other barge. It was fairly old; its paint had faded; but it was
well polished and kept very clean by a bargeman of the name Delâtre
and his wife. From the outside there was very little to see of the
<i>Nonchalante</i>'s cargo, a few cases, some old baskets, and
three or four casks. But if you had slipped down the ladder into
the hold, you would have seen at a glance that she carried
absolutely nothing whatever. The whole of the inside had been
divided into three rooms of moderate size, uncommonly comfortable
and exceedingly well-kept&mdash;two staterooms opening into a
saloon.</p>

<p>There Ralph and Josephine lived for a month. Monsieur and Madame
Delâtre seemed to be morose; and they were certainly silent.
Several times Ralph tried in vain to get into conversation with
them. They acted as cook and butler. From time to time a small tug
came to tow the <i>Nonchalante</i> up a reach of the Seine.</p>

<p>The whole course of the charming river in this way unrolled
itself before their eyes in delightful landscapes through which
they wandered, Ralph's arm round Josephine's waist...the Brotonne
Forest, the ruins of Jumièges, Saint George's Abbey, the hills of
Bouille, Rouen, Pont-de-l'Arche.</p>

<p>They were weeks of intense happiness. During those delightful
hours Ralph expended a wealth of gaiety and enthusiasm. The
wonderful views, the beautiful Gothic churches, the sunsets and the
moonlight, everything served him as pretexts for impassioned
declarations of his love. Josine, more silent, smiled as in a happy
dream. Every day drew her closer to her lover. If at the beginning
she had acted from a mere caprice, she now found herself under the
yoke of the law of love which quickened her pulses and taught her
the danger and the pain of loving too much.</p>

<p>Of the past, of her secret life, never a word. Once however they
did exchange a few sentences on this subject. As Ralph was chaffing
her about what he called the miracle of her eternal youth, she
said:</p>

<p>"A miracle? I don't understand what people mean by a miracle.
For example, the other day we drove sixty miles...You cried out
that it was a miracle. But if you'd kept your eyes a little wider
open, you would have perceived that that distance was covered not
by two horses but by four, for Leonard took the pair which had been
drawing it out of the carriage and harnessed another pair in their
places in that farmyard at Doudeville, where a relay was waiting
for us."</p>

<p>"You have me there!" exclaimed the young man cheerfully.</p>

<p>"Another example," she went on: "No one in the world knows that
your name is Lupin. But I assure you that that very night you
rescued me from death, I knew you as Arsène Lupin and nothing else.
A miracle? Not a bit of it. You know that everything that concerns
Cagliostro interests me extremely; and when fourteen years ago I
heard talk of the disappearance of the Queen's necklace from the
house of the Duchess of Dreux-Soubise, I made the most minute
enquiry into the circumstances. That brought me first of all to
little Ralph d'Andresy and then to the son of Theophrastus Lupin.
Later I found traces of your handiwork in several jobs. I knew
where I was."</p>

<p>Ralph reflected thoughtfully for a good half-minute; then he
said very seriously:</p>

<p>"At that date Josine, darling, either you were twelve years old,
and it certainly is miraculous that a little girl of that age
should have succeeded in an enquiry in which the rest of the world
failed, or you were as old as you are today, which is even more
miraculous, O daughter of Cagliostro!"</p>

<p>She frowned. His jesting did not seem at all to her taste. She
said even more seriously than he:</p>

<p>"We won't talk about that, Ralph&mdash;if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," said Ralph, a little annoyed at having been
discovered to be Lupin and desiring to score off her in turn.
"Nothing in the world interests me more strongly than the problem
of your age and the different exploits you have performed during
the last hundred years. I've got some ideas of my own on the matter
which are really worthy of consideration."</p>

<p>"Keep them to yourself," she said sharply.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like me to tell you about them?"</p>

<p>She gazed at him, curious in spite of her reluctance to discuss
the matter. He took advantage of her hesitation to continue in a
faintly mocking tone:</p>

<p>"My train of reasoning rests on two axioms: the first is, as you
have pointed out, there are no miracles; the second is that you are
your mother's daughter."</p>

<p>She smiled and murmured: "It certainly begins well."</p>

<p>"You are your mother's daughter," Ralph repeated. "That means
that there was in the first place a Countess of Cagliostro. At the
age of twenty-five or thirty, she dazzled all the Paris of the end
of the Second Empire with her beauty and excited the liveliest
curiosity at the Court of Napoleon III. With the aid of the young
man she called her brother&mdash;it doesn't matter whether he was
her brother, her friend, or her lover&mdash;she had worked up the
story of her relationship to Cagliostro and prepared the forged
documents of which the police made use when they gave Napoleon III
the information about the daughter of Josephine Beauharnais and
that great thaumaturge. Expelled from France, she went to Italy,
then to Germany, then disappeared&mdash;to come to life again
twenty-two years later in the person of her adorable daughter, her
exact image, the second Countess of Cagliostro, here present. Do we
agree so far?"</p>

<p>Josine did not answer; she gazed at him with in expressive eyes
in an impassive face.</p>

<p>He went on: "Between the mother and the daughter the resemblance
was perfect&mdash;so exact that the affair began, quite naturally,
all over again. Why should there be two Countesses? There will only
be one, a single one, the unique and genuine Countess, she who has
inherited the secrets of her father, Joseph Balsamo, the Count of
Cagliostro. And when Beaumagnan sets about making his enquiry, it
inevitably happens that he discover the documents which have
already sent the police of Napoleon astray, and the series of
portraits and miniatures which bear witness to the identity of the
ever youthful woman and carries her origin back to the virgin of
Luini to whom chance has given her such an astonishing
resemblance.</p>

<p>"Moreover there is a living witness: the Prince of Arcola. The
Prince of Arcola in the old days knew the Countess of Cagliostro.
He conducted her to Modena. He saw her at Versailles. When he saw
her a few years ago the exclamation escapes from him: 'It is she!
And not a day older than she was!'</p>

<p>"Thereupon you overwhelm him with a world of proofs. You repeat
the actual words exchanged at Modena between him and your mother,
the actual words which you read in the very minute diary which your
mother kept even of her least important doings and sayings. There
is the complete explanation of the affair. And it is
extraordinarily simple. A mother and a daughter who are exactly
like one another and whose image recalls a picture of Luini.</p>

<p>"There is besides the Marquise de Belmonte. But I expect that
the resemblance of that lady to you is fairly vague and that the
strong prepossession and deranged brain of Beaumagnan were
necessary to mix the two of you up. To sum up, there is nothing
dramatic about it. It is merely an amusing and admirably managed
intrigue. That's my account of the business."</p>

<p>He was silent. It appeared to him that Josine had lost some of
her color and that she was frowning. She must be annoyed in her
turn; and it made him laugh.</p>

<p>"I've hit the right nail on the head? What?" he said
cheerfully.</p>

<p>She shrank away from him, saying coldly: "My past is my business
and my age concerns nobody but myself. You can believe exactly what
you like about them."</p>

<p>He caught hold of her and kissed her furiously.</p>

<p>"I believe that you are four hundred years old, Josephine
Balsamo, and that there is nothing more delightful to kiss than a
centenarian. When I think that you have perhaps known Robespierre
and perhaps Louis XVI&mdash;"</p>

<p>They did not discuss the matter again, for Ralph was so clearly
aware of Josephine's irritation at the slightest indiscreet attempt
to probe her secret, that he did not dare to question her again.
Besides, did he not know the exact truth?</p>

<p>Certainly he knew it and not a doubt remained in his mind.
Nevertheless the young woman retained a mysterious prestige, which
impressed him in spite of himself and rather annoyed him. He
thought, seeing her withdrawn and aloof, of those Gods of Olympus
who enveloped themselves in a thick mist. So round Josephine there
were on every side impassable spaces in the midst of which she
disappeared from his sight. Why also did she refuse to discuss the
candlestick with seven branches and the enterprise of Beaumagnan?
Was not that the affair which had brought them together and in a
way associated them in a common task of conquest and vengeance?</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>At the end of the third week Leonard reappeared. Again Ralph saw
the barouche with the little lean horses in it; and the Countess
drove away in it.</p>

<p>She did not return till the evening. Leonard carried on to the
barge two bundles wrapped in napkins which he slipped into a
cupboard, of whose existence Ralph had been ignorant.</p>

<p>That night Ralph, having succeeded in opening the cupboard,
examined the two bundles. They contained admirable lace and
valuable vestments.</p>

<p>The next day there was another expedition. The result, was
sixteenth-century tapestry.</p>

<p>On those days Ralph was exceedingly bored. Therefore at Mantes,
finding himself once more alone, he hired a bicycle and for some
hours rode about the country. After having lunched at an inn, he
saw on the outskirts of a small country town a great mansion, the
garden of which was swarming with people. He went to it. They were
selling by auction some beautiful furniture and plate.</p>

<p>Idly he strolled round the house. The garden at the end of one
of the wings was empty and against the wall was a thick shrubbery.
Without considering what impulse urged him to the act, Ralph,
seeing a ladder hanging against the garden wall, set it up against
the house, climbed it, and slipped a leg over the sill of an open
window.</p>

<p>There came a faint cry from inside the room; and he saw the
startled face of Josephine. She recovered herself on the instant
and said in a perfectly composed voice:</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Ralph, is it? I was just admiring a collection of
beautifully bound little books. Wonders! And of an extraordinary
rarity!"</p>

<p>That was all they said. Ralph examined the books and slipped
three Elzevirs into his pocket while the Countess without Ralph's
perceiving it, helped herself to some coins from a glass case.</p>

<p>They went down the main staircase and took their departure. In
all that crowd no one took any notice of them. Three hundred yards
down the road the carriage was waiting for them.</p>

<p>After that, at Pointoise, at Saint Germain, at Paris, where the
<i>Nonchalante</i>, moored to the quay in front of the prefecture
of police, continued to serve them as an abode, they "operated"
together. Together but in such a fashion that neither could see the
other's actions. "Let us turn our eyes away and say nothing about
it," Josephine Balsamo had said. A supreme modesty which spared
them the sight of a mean action.</p>

<p>If the reserved nature and the enigmatic soul of the Countess de
Cagliostro found a perfectly natural expression in the
accomplishment of these tasks, the impulsive nature of Ralph little
by little gained the upper hand; and every time the operation
finished in bursts of laughter. Success provoked in him veritable
fits of hilarity.</p>

<p>"Since I've turned my back on the path of virtue, I may just as
well take it lightly as not, and certainly not in the funereal way
in which you do, Josine," he said airily.</p>

<p>At every new essay he discovered in himself unexpected talents
and resources of which he had never dreamt. Sometimes, in a shop,
on a racecourse, at the theater, his companion heard a gentle
murmur of joy and saw a watch in her lover's hands, or a new pin in
his cravat&mdash;and always the same coolness, always the serenity
of an innocent man whom no danger can threaten.</p>

<p>But that did not prevent him taking the manifold precautions
demanded by Josephine. They only left the barge in the dress of
barge-folk. In a neighboring street, the old barouche with a single
horse harnessed to it was waiting for them. In it they changed
their clothes. Josephine always hid her face under a beautiful,
flowered lace veil.</p>

<p>All these facts and a great many others fully informed Ralph
about the real life of his mistress. He had no doubt whatever that
she was at the head of a well organized band of confederates, with
whom she held communication by means of Leonard. But also he had no
doubt that she was prosecuting her search for the Candlestick with
Seven Branches and keeping a close watch on the actions of
Beaumagnan and his friends.</p>

<p>A double life, which often awoke in Ralph a dull irritation
against Josephine, as she herself had foreseen. Forgetting his own
actions, he was angry with her for acting in a manner which was not
in accord with the ideas which in spite of everything, he retained
about that matter of honesty. A mistress who was a thief and leader
of a band of thieves shocked him. Now and again there was a
collision between them with regard to quite insignificant matters.
Their two personalities, so definite and so powerful, came into
conflict.</p>

<p>So, when some trifle brought them into conflict, for all that
they were confronting common enemies, they learned how much a love
like theirs can, at certain moments, contain of rancor, pride, and
hostility.</p>

<p>The incident which brought to an end what Ralph called the
delights of Capua was an unexpected meeting one evening with
Beaumagnan, the Baron d'Etigues, and Oscar de Bennetot. They saw
the three friends go into the Theater of Varieties.</p>

<p>"Let's follow them," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The Countess hesitated. He insisted.</p>

<p>"What?" he cried. "When such an opportunity presents itself,
aren't we going to profit by it?"</p>

<p>"What's the use?" she asked.</p>

<p>"What's the use?" he answered quickly. "But what a funny
question! Are you afraid of my finding myself face to face with
Beaumagnan?"</p>

<p>"No: but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Look here, Josine: you do as you like. But I'm going after
them."</p>

<p>Both of them went into the theater and established themselves at
the back of a box. As they did so, in another box, quite close to
the stage, they just had time to perceive before the attendant drew
down the screen, the figures of Beaumagnan and his two
acolytes.</p>

<p>A problem presented itself to them. Why should Beaumagnan, a
churchman and apparently a man of rather ascetic habits, be found
straying into a theater of the boulevards, in which they were
playing a revue adorned with a very scantily dressed chorus, which
could not be of the least interest to him? It was quite evident
that there must be a reason of considerable importance and most
probably, seeing who were with him, connected with the affair of
the Candlestick, to bring him to such a place. To discover that
reason was to catch up Beaumagnan in a single stride at the point
he had reached in his investigations.</p>

<p>Ralph pointed out these facts to Josephine. She appeared to take
no interest whatever in them; and her indifference made it clear to
him that she had no intention whatever of taking him into
partnership and that she had definitely decided that she did not
desire his assistance in this mysterious affair.</p>

<p>"Very well," he said to her firmly. "Where there is a lack of
trust, let each go his own way and each for himself. We shall see
who collars the prize."</p>

<p>On the stage the girls of the chorus were dancing while the
chief characters passed in front of them. The leading lady, a very
pretty girl with very few clothes on, was taking the part of the
spirit of a waterfall and she justified her name by the cascades of
false jewels which streamed all round her. Round her forehead was a
bandeau set with jewel of many colors, and her hair was lighted up
with electric lamps.</p>

<p>During the first two acts the screen in front of the stage box
remained down so that no one could see who were its occupants. But,
during the interval after the second act, Ralph who had strolled
round to the door of that box discovered that it was a little way
open. He peeped in. The box was empty. He enquired of the attendant
and learned that the three gentlemen had left the theater in the
middle of the first act.</p>

<p>He went back to Josephine and said: "There's nothing to be done
here. They've cleared out."</p>

<p>At that moment the curtain rose again. The leading lady once
more appeared on the stage. Her hair drawn a little further back
made it easier to see the bandeau which she was still wearing. He
saw that it was a broad gold ribbon, in which were set large jewels
<i>en cabochon</i>, of different colors. There were seven of
them.</p>

<p>"Seven!" thought Ralph. "That explains why Beaumagnan came
here."</p>

<p>While Josephine was in the ladies' cloakroom, he learned from
one of the attendants that the leading lady of the revue, Bridget
Rousselin, lived in an old house in Montmartre and came every day
with a faithful old servant by the name of Valentine, to the
rehearsal of the revue they were putting on next.</p>

<p>Next morning at eleven Ralph left the <i>Nonchalante</i>. He
lunched in a restaurant in Montmartre, and soon after twelve,
strolling down a steep, winding street, he passed in front of a
small narrow house with a courtyard in front enclosed by a wall,
and next door to a house divided into unfurnished flats. The
curtainless windows of the top flat made it quite clear that it was
vacant.</p>

<p>Forthwith, with his usual quickness, he formed one of those
plans, which, directly it was formed, he put into execution almost
mechanically. The situation of the house was uncommonly convenient
for his purpose; and he was delighted to think that in a very short
time he would know something which Josephine did not know and which
would enable him to tease her. At the same time he made up his
mind, as a loyal partner, to give her the benefit of his
discoveries.</p>

<p>He strolled up and down with the air of a man who was waiting
for someone. Of a sudden, taking advantage of the fact that the
janitor of the flats was busy mopping the pavement in front of the
house, he slipped behind her back into it, ran up the stairs to the
top, forced the door of the empty flat, opened one of the windows
which looked down on the roof of the house next door, made sure
that no one could see him, and slipped out on to the roof.</p>

<p>It was only a few steps to a half-open dormer window. He climbed
through it into a garret full of broken furniture, from which one
descended to the floor below through a trap-door. He had some
difficulty in raising it a little way noiselessly and looked down
on to the second-floor landing. There was no ladder.</p>

<p>Below, on the first floor, two women were talking. Listening
with all his ears he learned that Bridget Rousselin was lunching in
her boudoir, and that her servant, apparently the only other person
in the house, was dusting her bedroom and dressing room in the
intervals of waiting on her.</p>

<p>Then Bridget Rousselin called out: "I've finished, Valentine.
What a blessing it is that there's no rehearsal today! I'm going
back to bed till I have to start for the theater!"</p>

<p>This day at home rather upset Ralph's plans, for he had been
expecting to make a thorough search of the house at his ease during
her absence at rehearsal. Nevertheless he did not lose patience; he
just waited for the luck to turn.</p>

<p>Some minutes passed. Bridget was humming some of the music of
the new revue. Then the front-door bell rang.</p>

<p>"That's odd, Valentine," she said. "I wasn't expecting anyone
today. Go and see who it is."</p>

<p>The maid went downstairs. There came the sound of the opening
and shutting of the front door.</p>

<p>She came upstairs again and said: "It's a gentleman from the
theater&mdash;the manager's secretary. He brought this letter."</p>

<p>"Thanks. You showed him into the drawing room?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>From the clearness with which he heard her voice Ralph gathered
that Bridget had come out on to the first-floor landing. He heard
her tear open the envelope.</p>

<p>Then she said: "That's funny. The manager wants me to send him
the bandeau I wear in the show, by his secretary. He wants to get
it copied, and he'll let me have it back at the theater
tonight."</p>

<p>Ralph swore under his breath: "Hang it!" he thought. "That
bandeau is the chief object of my search. Is this manager also on
the trail of it? And is Bridget Rousselin going to send it along to
him?"</p>

<p>Her next words set his mind at rest.</p>

<p>"But I can't do it," she said. "I've already promised those
stones."</p>

<p>"That's a pity," said Valentine. "The manager will be
annoyed."</p>

<p>"I can't help it. I've promised to sell them&mdash;and for a big
price too," said the actress.</p>

<p>"Then what am I to say?" asked Valentine.</p>

<p>"I must write to him," said Bridget.</p>

<p>She went into her boudoir, wrote the note, and gave it to
Valentine.</p>

<p>"By the way, do you know this secretary?" she said carelessly.
"Have you seen him at the theater?"</p>

<p>"No, I haven't. He must be a new one," said Valentine.</p>

<p>"Tell him to tell the manager how sorry I am, and that I'll tell
him all about it at the theater tonight."</p>

<p>Valentine went downstairs again; Bridget went to the piano and
did two or three voice exercises. They must have drowned the noise
of the shutting of the house door, for Ralph did not hear it. The
minutes passed.</p>

<p>He felt somewhat uncomfortable. This business seemed to him
rather queer&mdash;this secretary they did not know, this request
for the jewels looked to him uncommonly like a trap of some
sort.</p>

<p>Then he was reassured by the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
They went to the door of the boudoir.</p>

<p>"Valentine," he said to himself. "There was nothing in my
fancies. The man has gone."</p>

<p>But of a sudden the playing stopped short in the middle of a
run. Evidently the actress jumped up so suddenly as to upset the
piano stool, for it banged on the floor. She said in an uneasy
voice:</p>

<p>"Who are you?...Oh, of course, you're Monsieur Lenoir's new
secretary...But what is it you want?"</p>

<p>A man's voice answered: "Monsieur Lenoir gave me the strictest
instructions to bring those jewels back with me; and I must insist
on having them."</p>

<p>"But I have written to him!" exclaimed Bridget in a yet more
uneasy voice..."My maid must have given you the letter...Why hasn't
she come upstairs? Valentine!"</p>

<p>The door of the boudoir was banged violently. Ralph heard the
noise of a struggle and cries of: "Help! Help!" Then silence.</p>

<p>The moment he had grasped the fact that Bridget Rousselin was in
danger, he had tried to open wide the trap-door, noiselessly. But
it stuck; and he lost precious time in forcing it up. Then he
dropped onto the landing, ran down to the first floor and found
three doors, all closed, to choose from.</p>

<p>As chance had it the one he opened was the door of the boudoir.
It was empty and two or three chairs had been knocked over. An
inner door led to the dressing room. That was empty too. He stepped
into the bedroom whither the actress had fled.</p>

<p>The curtains were drawn. In the dim light he saw a man kneeling
over a woman prone on the carpet, gripping her throat with both
hands, and swearing abominably.</p>

<p>"Hell! You won't shut your mouth, won't you? You won't hand over
those jewels, won't you? I'll show you, curse you!"</p>

<p>Ralph flung himself upon him. He loosened his grip on the
woman's throat and rolled over. Ralph's head banged against the
fireplace with a violence that dazed him for a moment.</p>

<p>That was unfortunate; and in addition this murderous ruffian was
heavier than he, powerfully built, with muscles of steel. It looked
as if the slender and youthful Ralph had no chance whatever against
him. But there was a sudden groan and the big man rolled over and
lay inert, while Ralph rose lightly to his feet.</p>

<p>He said: "A pretty stroke, wasn't it, old boy? I got it from the
posthumous instructions of a gentleman named Theophrastus
Lupin&mdash;from a chapter which deals with Japanese methods. It
transports you to a better world for a minute or two and renders
you as harmless as a lamb."</p>

<p>Without the loss of a moment he took the curtain cords and bound
together the wrists of his opponent.</p>

<p>He had moved the curtains and was working in a fair light. He
turned the man over to see his face. A sharp cry of amazement burst
from his lips; and he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Leonard!...Leonard, begad!"</p>

<p>He had never had a really good view of Josephine's coachman. He
had always seen him crouched on the box of the carriage, with his
head between his shoulders, and so disguising his figure that Ralph
believed him to be almost a hunchback and certainly a weakling. But
there was no mistaking that bony face ending in that gray beard. It
was beyond all doubting Leonard, Josephine's factotum and right
hand man.</p>

<p>He bound his legs together, just to make sure; and then on the
carpet beside him he saw a whistle. He picked it up and was just
about to stick it back in Leonard's pocket when an idea came to
him. He went to the window and peeped round the edge of the
curtain. On the other side of the street, about twenty yards down
it, stood the old carriage.</p>

<p>On the box sat a young man in livery. But inside the carriage
there was surely another confederate. Ralph was sure of it; and now
nothing in the world would have prevented him from carrying the
matter through to the bitter end.</p>

<p>He turned his attention to Bridget, who was moaning faintly,
picked her up, and laid her on the bed. The marks of the ruffian's
fingers were very red on her throat; but he had been in time to
prevent the worst. She was only suffering from shock and terror.
She half-opened her eyes.</p>

<p>He poured some water from the carafe into the tooth-glass,
raised her, and held it to her lips. She swallowed a little, with
difficulty. It seemed to relieve her; and she began to cry.</p>

<p>"Never mind! You'll be all right presently," he said gently.
"Shut your eyes and relax. Don't move till I come back. I'll
relieve you of the presence of this gentleman. I'll take him into
the next room and question him. You're quite safe. I'm a detective;
and luckily I was on his track."</p>

<p>He was pretty sure that she would keep quiet and give him no
trouble. Probably, in the reaction, she would fall into the
profound sleep of those who have been tortured and badly
frightened. He dragged Leonard into the boudoir and shut the
bedroom door. Then he went downstairs.</p>

<p>A glance into the drawingroom showed him Valentine, as he had
expected, in exactly the same condition as he had left Leonard. He
decided that she was best as she was. It left him a freer hand.</p>

<p>"It's all right, miss," he said in a reassuring voice. "I'll
loose you presently. I'm a detective; and the first thing for me to
do is to catch the rest of the gang."</p>

<p>He went down the passage to the front door. As he had expected,
it was not latched. He opened it an inch or two and looked at the
door of the courtyard. Leonard had left that unlatched also.</p>

<p>Ralph permitted himself a somewhat sardonic smile. Then he went
upstairs, opened the window of the boudoir a little way, and blew
the whistle.</p>

<p>One of two things would happen. Either the whistle would be a
warning to the confederate that things had gone wrong; and she
would decamp. Or it would be a signal that the coast was clear and
that she could join Leonard in the search for the jewels and any
other evidence there was to be found in Bridget Rousselin's
house.</p>

<p>He waited with a very somber air, his eye on the door of the
courtyard. He was extraordinarily disturbed, horrified indeed. It
was one thing to relieve well-to-do persons of objects of luxury,
of which they had no real need, and which they hadn't the sense to
keep&mdash;quite another to be an accomplice in a cold blooded
murder. Surely the woman he adored would never go to such lengths.
As the horror of it grew clearer and clearer, his pulse quickened
in a feverish anguish. Who would come through the door of the
courtyard?</p>

<p>That door opened; <i>on the threshold stood Josephine
Balsamo</i>!</p>

<p>Ralph gasped; and for the moment his eyes went blind.</p>

<p>Then he was filled with a bitter fury.</p>

<p>Josephine came quietly through the door, as carelessly as if she
were merely paying a call on a friend, and walked across the
courtyard. The moment Leonard whistled, the way was clear; she had
only to go to him.</p>

<p>Ralph was furious but quite calm. He was ready to fight this
second adversary as he had fought the first, and conquer her, but
with very different weapons.</p>

<p>He took the further precaution of locking the door of the
dressing room. Bridget Rousselin could not interrupt them, even if
she found the strength to do so. There came the sound of a light
footfall on the staircase. The door opened and Josephine
entered.</p>

<p>Ralph had formed a very just estimate of Josephine's power of
self-control. But he did expect that the unexpected scene which met
her eyes and the sudden and unexpected sight of him would shake it.
Nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>She stopped short, gazed round the room, took in the trussed-up
Leonard and Ralph's indignant face in a glance that lasted perhaps
a second and a half.</p>

<p>Then she pushed up her veil and said in the most casual voice:
"What are you looking at me like that for, dear?"</p>

<p>He stared at her with all his eyes; he did not wish to lose a
quiver of her eyelids, or the faintest twitch of her lips. He said
slowly:</p>

<p>"Bridget Rousselin has been murdered."</p>

<p>"Bridget Rousselin&mdash;murdered?" she said under her
breath.</p>

<p>"Yes. The actress we saw last night, the one who was wearing the
bandeau of jewels. You're not going to tell me that you don't know
who she is, for you're here, in her house, and you had instructed
Leonard to let you know directly he had done the job."</p>

<p>Her self-control indeed went. With a horror-stricken face and
starting eyes, she cried: "Leonard?...Leonard?...He has&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," declared Ralph. "He's murdered Bridget Rousselin. I
caught him in the very act of throttling her."</p>

<p>Her legs seemed to fail her; she sank trembling on to a chair
and stammered:</p>

<p>"The b-blackguard...The b-b-blackguard...It's impossible!"</p>

<p>And on a rising inflection in which with each word the note of
terror grew clearer and clearer, she cried:</p>

<p>"He's committed a murder?...A murder?...It's impossible!...He
swore to me that he would never kill!...He swore it!...I can't
believe it!"</p>

<p>Was she sincere, or was it all comedy? Had Leonard acted in a
sudden access of madness, or in accordance with instructions which
bade him murder if the ruse failed. Formidable questions to which
Ralph could not give the answer.</p>

<p>She raised her head, saw the accusation in his eyes, jerked
herself to her feet and with hands outstretched towards him cried:
"Why are you looking at me like that, Ralph? Oh, you can't suspect
me of a horrible crime like that! You can't!...You can't believe
that I knew of it...That I ordered or permitted such an abominable
crime!...Tell me you don't!"</p>

<p>Almost brutally he caught her by the shoulder and forced her
onto the chair again. Then, crossing his arms, he took two or three
paces up the room and back; then, catching her again by the
shoulder and glaring into her eyes, he said slowly in the accents
of an inexorable accuser and even enemy:</p>

<p>"Listen to me, Josine. If you don't, this very instant, make a
clean breast of it and tell me the whole story of this business and
all the secret machinations which complicate it, I'm going to treat
you as my mortal enemy. I'm going to take you out of this house, by
force if I have to, to the nearest police station and denounce you
as the accomplice of Leonard in the murder of Bridget Rousselin.
Then you can get out of it as best you can. Are you going to tell
me, or are you not?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>8. Two Wills</h2>

<p>War was declared, and at the moment chosen by Ralph, a moment at
which all the circumstances were in his favor, and Josephine, taken
by surprise, weakened before an onslaught of a violence and
implacability she had never looked for.</p>

<p>It must not, however, be supposed that a woman of her stamp was
going to accept defeat without a struggle. She tried to resist. She
would not admit that a tender and charming lover like Ralph
d'Andresy could, at a single stroke, stand forth as her master and
impose on her the harsh constraint of his will. She had recourse to
wheedling, then to tears and promises, to all a woman's wiles. He
showed himself inexorable.</p>

<p>"Will you speak!" he roared. "I've had enough of this obscurity.
You may take a delight in it. I don't. I like things perfectly
clear."</p>

<p>"What things do you want me to throw light on?" she cried,
exasperated. "My life?"</p>

<p>"Your life is your own affair," replied Ralph. "Keep your past
dark, if you're afraid to unfold it before my eyes. I'm perfectly
well aware that you will always be an enigma to me and everyone
else, and that your innocent face will never throw any light on
what is going on at the bottom of your soul. But what I want to
know is that side of your life which touches mine. We have a common
end in view. Let me know the path you are following. If you don't,
I run the risk of getting mixed up in some abominable crime, and
that's the last thing I want."</p>

<p>He hammered his right fist into his left palm.</p>

<p>"Get that clear, Josine! I will not murder! Rob? Yes. Burgle?
Yes. But murder? No! A thousand times no!"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to murder, either," she protested.</p>

<p>"Perhaps not. But you let other people murder for you."</p>

<p>"It's a lie!"</p>

<p>"Then speak out&mdash;explain."</p>

<p>She wrung her hands and with a groan protested: "I can't! I
can't!"</p>

<p>"Why? What prevents you from telling me all you know about this
business, the things Beaumagnan revealed to you?" he urged.</p>

<p>"I should prefer not to let you get mixed up in this affair, not
to let you oppose that man," she said earnestly.</p>

<p>He burst out laughing. "You're frightened on my account,
perhaps?" he jeered. "A fine excuse! Reassure yourself, Josine. I'm
not afraid of Beaumagnan. There's another adversary I fear much
more than him."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"You."</p>

<p>He repeated in harsher accents: "You, my dear. And that's the
reason why I'm so keen on getting the thing clear. When I shall
really see you clearly, I shall no longer fear you. Have you made
up your mind?"</p>

<p>She shook her head and said slowly: "No, I haven't!"</p>

<p>Ralph burst out furiously: "That is to say, you don't trust me.
It's a splendid affair; you wish to keep it entirely to yourself.
Right. We'll be going. You will have a clearer view of the
situation outside."</p>

<p>With that he caught her in his arms and swung her over his
shoulder as he had done at their first meeting at the foot of the
cliff and, so burdened, walked towards the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" she said.</p>

<p>This feat of strength, accomplished with an incredible ease,
finished her taming. She felt that she had better not provoke him
further.</p>

<p>He set her down on her feet. She sank on to a chair and said:
"What is it you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Everything. First of all the reason for your coming here and
for that scoundrel's murdering Bridget Rousselin."</p>

<p>"The bandeau with the stones in it," she said.</p>

<p>"But they're worthless&mdash;imitation garnets, imitation
topazes, opals, beryls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes. But there are seven of them."</p>

<p>"What of it? What was the object of his murdering her? It was so
simple to bide your time and ransack her rooms the first chance you
got," he suggested.</p>

<p>"Evidently. But it looked as if other people were on the track
of them."</p>

<p>"Other people?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Early this morning, acting on my instructions, Leonard
made inquiries about this Bridget Rousselin, for last night I
noticed the bandeau she was wearing; and he reported that people
were prowling about this house."</p>

<p>"People? What people?" he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Emissaries of the Belmonte woman."</p>

<p>"The woman who is mixed up in the business?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes. You find her everywhere."</p>

<p>"Well, what of it? Was that a reason for murder?"</p>

<p>"He must have lost his head. And it was my fault for telling him
that I must have the bandeau at any cost."</p>

<p>"Well, you see what it is: We're at the mercy of a brute who
loses his head and murders senselessly, stupidly. It's time to make
an end of it, look you. I'm much more strongly inclined to believe
that the people who were prowling round this house this morning
were emissaries of Beaumagnan. Now you're not of a force to measure
yourself against Beaumagnan. Let me take over the management of the
affair. If you want to succeed, it is through me, and through me
only, that you will succeed."</p>

<p>Josine weakened. Ralph asserted his superiority in a tone of
such conviction that she had, so to speak, a strong physical
impression of it. She saw him greater than he was and more
powerful, more richly endowed than any other man she had known,
equipped with a more subtle spirit, keener eyes, more diverse
methods of action. She bent before this implacable will, before
this immense energy that no consideration could turn from its
course.</p>

<p>"Very well. I <i>will</i> tell you everything," she said. "But
why here?"</p>

<p>"Here&mdash;and nowhere else," said Ralph firmly, knowing well
that if the Countess of Cagliostro was once really herself again,
he would obtain nothing.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said again, in a tone of bitter resignation.
"Very well. I give in, since our love is at stake, and you seem to
take it so little into account."</p>

<p>Ralph experienced a sensation of profound pride. For the first
time he was conscious of exercising a real ascendancy over others,
and of the extraordinary power with which he imposed his decisions
on them. Truly the Countess was not in complete command of her
usual resources. The supposed murder of Bridget Rousselin had to a
considerable degree undermined her power of resistance, and the
spectacle of the trussed-up Leonard added to her nervous distress.
But how swiftly he had seized his opportunity and profited by his
advantage to establish by threats and terrorizing, by force and
cunning, his definite victory!</p>

<p>Now, he was the master. He had forced Josephine Balsamo to
surrender and at the same time disciplined his own love. Kisses,
caresses, seductive wiles, the enchantment of passion, the
obsession of desire, he no longer feared any of them, since he had
gone to the very verge of a rupture.</p>

<p>He picked up the rug which lay in front of the fire place and
rendered Leonard deaf by throwing it over him. Then he went back to
Josine and sat down facing her.</p>

<p>"Fire away," he said.</p>

<p>"Since you will have it," she said in a tone of resignation,
"we'll go straight through with it and make an end of it as quickly
as possible. I'll spare you the details and come to the main facts
straight away. It won't take long, and it won't be complicated. Two
and twenty years ago then, during the months which preceded the
Franco-Prussian war, Cardinal de Bonnechose, Archbishop of Rouen
and senator, making a confirmation tour through the Caux country,
was caught in a terrible storm and had to take shelter in the
Château de Gueures, which was at that time inhabited by its last
owner, the Chevalier des Aubes. He dined there. That night, as he
was about to go to the bedroom they had got ready for him, the
Chevalier des Aubes, an old man of nearly eighty, decrepit, but in
full possession of his faculties, asked for a private interview
with him. This was at once granted and lasted a long time. Here is
a resumé of the revelations to which the cardinal listened, a
resumé which he himself drew up later, of which I shall not change
a single word. I know it by heart:</p>

<p>"'Monseigneur,' the chevalier began, 'I shall not astonish you
by saying that my early years were spent in the middle of the great
revolutionary tumult. At the time of the Terror I was twelve years
old. I was an orphan, and every day I accompanied my aunt des Aubes
to the neighboring prison, where she distributed the little money
she could spare and tended the sick. They imprisoned all kinds of
unfortunates and tried and condemned them as the fancy took them.
So it came about that I saw a good deal of a gentleman whose name
no one knew, or why he had been arrested, or who had denounced him.
The attentions I paid him and my piety won his confidence. He grew
fond of me, and on the evening of the day on which he had been
tried and condemned, he said to me:</p>

<p>"'At dawn tomorrow, my child, the gendarmes are coming to
conduct me to the scaffold, and I shall die without anyone knowing
who I am. That is exactly as I wish it to be. I shall not even tell
you. But circumstances render it necessary that I should entrust
certain secrets to you and demand that you should listen to them as
if you were grown up and later deal with them with the loyalty and
coolness of a man. The mission with which I charge you is of the
highest importance. I feel confident that you will be able to rise
to the height of such a task and to keep, whatever happens, a
secret in which the most important interests are involved."</p>

<p>"'Thereupon he informed me that he was a priest and, as such,
the depositary of incalculable riches, in the form of precious
stones of such quality that in each the highest possible value was
attained in the smallest possible bulk. As they were acquired these
precious stones had been hidden in the most original hiding-place
in the world. In a corner of the Caux country, on common land on
which everyone is at liberty to set foot, stands one of those huge
blocks of stone which used to serve, and still serves, to mark the
boundary of certain properties, of fields, orchards, meadows,
woods, and so forth. This block of granite, with only its top above
the earth and surrounded by bushes, had two or three natural holes
in the top of it, filled up with earth in which grew small plants
and wild flowers. Through one of these openings from which they
carefully removed and replaced the lump of soil which closed it,
into this open-air strongbox, they let fall these magnificent
precious stones.</p>

<p>"'The cavities in the stones had actually been filled with them,
and since no other hiding-place had yet been chosen they had put
the stones which had been acquired during the last few years into a
sandalwood box which, a few days before his arrest, the priest had
himself buried at the foot of the block of stone.</p>

<p>"'He gave me directions for finding the place and communicated
to me a formula, composed of a unique word, which, in the case of
my forgetting the directions, would give me the hiding-place beyond
any possibility of error.</p>

<p>"'He then exacted a promise from me that, when peaceful times
returned, that is to say, at a date which he accurately reckoned to
be twenty years ahead, I should first go and make sure that
everything was in its place, and that starting from that date I
should be present at the high mass celebrated in the church of the
village of Gueures every Easter Sunday.</p>

<p>"'One Easter Sunday I should see a man dressed in black beside
the holy water font. As soon as I should tell this man in black my
name, he would take me close to the altar and point to a copper
candlestick with seven branches, the candles in which were only
lighted on feast-days. In response to this action of his I was to
confide to him the formula which revealed the hiding-place.</p>

<p>"'Those were the two signs by which we should recognize one
another; and after exchanging them I was to lead him to the block
of granite.</p>

<p>"'I swore upon my eternal salvation to follow blindly the
instructions he had given me. Next day the worthy priest mounted
the scaffold.</p>

<p>"'Although I was very young, monseigneur, when I took that oath,
I have kept it religiously. On the death of my aunt des Aubes I
enlisted as a drummer boy and went through all the wars of the
Directoire and the Empire. On the fall of Napoleon, at the age of
thirty, I was dismissed from the army, in which I had risen to the
rank of colonel. My first step was to make my way to the
hiding-place of the jewels. I easily found the block of granite.
Then on the Easter Sunday of 1816, at Gueures church I saw on the
altar the copper candlestick. That Sunday the man in black was not
standing by the holy water font.</p>

<p>"'I went to that church the next Easter Sunday and every Easter
Sunday since, for in the meantime I had bought the Château de
Gueures and after the manner of a scrupulous soldier I kept watch
at the post assigned to me. I waited.</p>

<p>"'I have been waiting fifty years, monseigneur. No one has come.
Not only has no one come but I have never heard a word from
anyone's lips which had the slightest connection with the affair.
The block of granite is in its place. Every Easter Sunday the
verger lights the candles in the seven branches of the candlestick.
But the man in black has never come to the meeting-place.</p>

<p>"'What was I to do? To whom was I to address myself? Enter into
communication with some ecclesiastical authority? Ask for an
audience of the King of France? No. My mission was strictly
defined. I had no right to interpret it in my own way.</p>

<p>"'I remained silent. But after how many debates in my own mind!
After what anguish at the thought that I might die and carry to my
grave a secret of this immense importance!</p>

<p>"'This evening, monseigneur, all my doubts and scruples have
vanished. Your fortuitous coming to the château appears to me an
undeniable manifestation of the Divine will. You are at once the
spiritual and temporal power. As Archbishop you represent the
Church. As senator you represent France. I run no risk of making a
mistake in making a revelation to you of such interest both to the
one and the other. Hence it is for you to make the choice,
monseigneur. Take the matter in hand, make the necessary
negotiations. And when you tell me into whose hands this sacred
stone should be delivered, I will reveal its hiding-place!'</p>

<p>"Cardinal Bonnechose had listened to the story without
interrupting. But at the end of it he told the chevalier frankly
that he found it rather hard to credit. Thereupon the chevalier
left the room and came back in a couple of minutes carrying a small
sandalwood casket.</p>

<p>"'Here is the casket of which the dead priest told me,' he said.
'I found it buried in front of the block of granite; and I though
it wiser to have it here. Take it away with you, monseigneur, and
have the several hundred precious stones it contains valued. You
will then be satisfied that the story I have told you is true, and
that that worthy priest was right to talk about incalculable
riches, since the block of granite contains&mdash;so he assured
me&mdash;ten thousand stones as fine as these.'</p>

<p>"The insistence of the chevalier and this proof which he
adduced, prevailed with the cardinal. He undertook to make the
necessary investigations and to summon the old gentleman to him as
soon as he had discovered the proper destination of the
treasure.</p>

<p>"The interview ended with this promise. The Archbishop had the
firmest intention of fulfilling it; but the events which followed
delayed him. These events, as you know, were the declaration of war
on Germany and the disasters which followed it. The heavy duties of
his double task took up all his time. The Empire fell in ruin.
France was invaded. Months passed.</p>

<p>"When Rouen was threatened, the cardinal, desirous of sending to
England certain documents which he reckoned of great importance,
decided to send with them the sandalwood casket. On the fourth of
December, the eve of the entry of the Germans into Rouen, a
confidential servant of the name of Jaubert drove off in a dogcart
along the road to Havre, where he was to embark.</p>

<p>"Two days later the cardinal learned that the body of Jaubert
had been found in the forest of Rouvray, in a ravine ten kilometers
from Rouen. The case containing the documents was brought back to
him. The horse, the dogcart, and the sandalwood casket had
disappeared. Investigation made it clear that the unfortunate
servant had fallen in with a squadron of German cavalry making a
reconnaissance beyond Rouen and robbing and murdering the
well-to-do inhabitants of that town, flying to Havre in their
carriages.</p>

<p>"Then came another piece of bad luck. At the beginning of
January the cardinal had word that the Chevalier des Aubes,
brokenhearted at the defeat of his country, had not survived it.
Before dying he had sent a message to the cardinal. It ran:</p>

<p class="letter">"'The word of the formula which reveals the
position of the block of granite is carved on the inside of the lid
of casket...I have buried the candlestick in my garden.'</p>

<p>"So nothing whatever was left. The casket had been stolen,
nothing was left to prove the truth that the story of the Chevalier
des Aubes contained a word of truth. No one had examined the
stones. Were they real, or were they imitation? Did the sandalwood
casket merely contain some stage jewels and colored pebbles?</p>

<p>"Little by little doubt invaded the mind of the cardinal, a
doubt so tenacious that in the end he decided to keep silent about
the matter. The narrative of the Chevalier des Aubes must be
considered an old man's wanderings. It would be dangerous to spread
abroad such trash. Therefore he would keep silence. But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But?" repeated Ralph, whom such trash interested
enormously.</p>

<p>"But, before finally making up his mind," Josephine went on, "he
wrote out this memorandum concerning his visit to the Château de
Gueures and the events which followed it, and either it got
mislaid, or he forgot all about it; and some years after his death
it was found in one of his theological books when his library was
sold by auction."</p>

<p>"Who found it?" said Ralph sharply.</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan."</p>

<p>She had related this story, with her head a little bowed, in the
rather monotonous voice of a schoolgirl reciting a lesson she has
learned by heart. When now she raised her eyes, she was astonished
by Ralph's expression.</p>

<p>"What on earth's the matter with you?" she said quickly, staring
at him.</p>

<p>"I find all this immensely exciting," he said. "Consider,
Josine: step by step, by the confidential information of three old
men, who have passed on the torch from one to the other, we go back
rather more than a century, and there we come into touch with a
legend&mdash;what do I say? with a formidable secret
rather&mdash;which goes back to the Middle Ages. The chain is
unbroken. Every link is in its place. And as the last link in this
chain behold Beaumagnan. What has Beaumagnan done? Must we declare
him worthy of his role, or relieve him of it? Am I to ally myself
with him or tear the torch from his hand?"</p>

<p>Ralph's exaltation made it quite clear to Josephine that he
would not allow her to break off her narrative. She hesitated,
however, for the most important words, perhaps&mdash;at any rate,
the most serious&mdash;remained to be spoken, the words which
assigned to her her role.</p>

<p>But he said sharply: "Go on, Josine. The path that lies before
us is magnificent. We will tread it together and together we will
enjoy the reward which is waiting for us at the end of it."</p>

<p>This was fairly reassuring; and she went on:</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan is explained in one word; and that word is
'ambition.' From the very beginning he made his religious vocation,
which is real enough, the servant of his ambition, which is
boundless; and the two of them guided him into the Society of
Jesus, in which he holds a post of considerable importance. The
discovery of the cardinal's memorandum made him lose his head.
Immense vistas have opened before him. He succeeded in convincing
some of his superiors that this treasure really exists, inflamed
them with the lust for incalculable wealth, and persuaded them to
put at his disposal all the influence which the Jesuits possess, to
help him in this enterprise.</p>

<p>"Then he gathered round him a dozen country gentlemen, more or
less honorable and more or less in debt, to whom he revealed only a
part of the affair and whom he has trained to be a band of
conspirators ready for any task. Each of them has his sphere of
action, each his sphere of investigation; and he holds them by the
money he lavishes on them.</p>

<p>"Two years of careful and minute investigation have produced
results by no means negligible. First of all they have learned that
the priest who was guillotined was Brother Nicolas, treasurer of
Fécamp Abbey. Then, by dint of ransacking secret archives and old
records, they have discovered a curious correspondence formerly
carried on between all the monasteries in France; and it appears to
be established that since a very remote time there was throughout
the country a current of money, which was in the nature of a tithe
paid by all the religious institutions, that flowed only into the
monasteries of the Caux country. This seems to have constituted a
common treasure, an inexhaustible reserve in view of possible
attacks to be repelled, or crusades to be undertaken. A treasury
council, composed of seven members, handled this wealth, but only
one of them knew its hiding-place.</p>

<p>"The Revolution destroyed all the monasteries. But the treasure
existed. Brother Nicolas was its last guardian."</p>

<p>A prolonged silence followed her narrative. Ralph's curiosity
had not been disappointed; and he was deeply moved. He murmured
with restrained enthusiasm:</p>

<p>"But how splendid it is! What a magnificent adventure! I have
always been perfectly certain that the past has bequeathed to the
present fabulous treasures, the search for which inevitably takes
the form of solving an almost insoluble problem. How could it be
otherwise? Unlike us, our ancestors had not at their disposal the
strongrooms and cellars of the Bank of France. They were obliged to
choose natural hiding-places in which they heaped up their gold and
jewels, and the secret of which they passed on by means of some
mnemonical formula which was, so to speak, the key of the lock. Let
a catastrophe occur, the secret was lost, and so was the treasure
so painfully accumulated."</p>

<p>His excitement was increasing, and he cried joyfully: "But this
treasure shall not be lost, Josine; and it is one of the most
fantastic of all of them. If Brother Nicolas spoke the
truth&mdash;and everything goes to show that he did speak the
truth&mdash;if the ten thousand precious stones were dropped into
this strange strongbox, one can reckon this property left by the
Middle Ages,* this result of the efforts of millions of monks, this
gigantic offering of a whole Christian people during the great
epoch of fanaticism, everything that is in the bowels of a boundary
stone in a meadow in Normandy at something like a thousand million
francs! It's wonderful!"</p>

<p class="footnote">[* There is no doubt that the well-known legend
of the Thousand Millions of the Congregations had its origin in
this tithe.]</p>

<p>Abruptly he moved to the couch on which Josephine was sitting
and sat down beside her as if he wished to cut short his declaiming
and demanded in imperious accents:</p>

<p>"And what has your role been in this adventure, Josine? What is
your contribution to it? Have you any special information from
Cagliostro?"</p>

<p>"Only a few words," she said. "On the list of the four enigmas
which he left and which is in my possession, he has written against
this one and against The Fortune of The Kings of France this
note:</p>

<p class="letter">"'Between Rouen, le Havre, and Dieppe. (So
Marie-Antoinette declared.).'"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes&mdash;the Caux country...the estuary of the
ancient river on the banks of which the Kings of France and the
monks so prospered," Ralph murmured thoughtfully. "It is
undoubtedly there that they have hidden the savings of ten
centuries of rule and ten centuries of religion...The two coffers
are there&mdash;not far from one another naturally&mdash;and it is
there that I shall find them."</p>

<p>Then, turning towards Josine, he added: "So you were hunting for
them, too?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but without any precise data."</p>

<p>"And another woman was looking for them as well as you?" he
said, looking into the depths of her eyes. "The woman who murdered
Beaumagnan's two confederates."</p>

<p>"Yes. The Marquise de Belmonte, who is, I suppose, another
descendant of Cagliostro," she said.</p>

<p>"And you found nothing?"</p>

<p>"Nothing till the day on which I met Beaumagnan."</p>

<p>"Who wished to avenge the murder of his two friends, what?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And little by little Beaumagnan told you everything he knew?"
he continued.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Of his own accord?"</p>

<p>"Of his own accord."</p>

<p>"That is to say, you guessed he was aiming at the same goal as
you, and you took advantage of the love with which you inspired him
to lead him on to confide in you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said frankly.</p>

<p>"It was a big game you were playing."</p>

<p>"As it turned out, I was staking my life. In making up his mind
to kill me he was undoubtedly actuated by the desire to rid himself
of the love which was a torture to him, since I did not respond to
it. And over and above that he was terrified at having revealed
these secrets to me. I had suddenly become the enemy who might
reach the goal before he did. The day he saw the mistake he had
made I was doomed."</p>

<p>"Yet his revelations were, after all, nothing but some
historical data, and vague at that," he objected.</p>

<p>"That's all they were," she admitted.</p>

<p>"And the branch of the candlestick which I got out of the little
pillar was the first piece of definite evidence that came to
light?"</p>

<p>"The very first."</p>

<p>"At least I suppose it was. For there is nothing to show that,
after your rupture, he did not advance a step or two himself,"
suggested Ralph.</p>

<p>"A step or two?" she exclaimed in a tone of dismay.</p>

<p>"Certainly, one step," he declared. "Last night Beaumagnan went
to the theater. Why, if not for the reason that Bridget Rousselin
wore across her forehead a bandeau set with seven jewels. He wished
to learn what it meant; and it was undoubtedly he who had her house
watched this morning."</p>

<p>"Admitting that it is so, there is no way of our knowing it,"
she objected.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; there is," he said.</p>

<p>"How? Who from?" she said quickly.</p>

<p>"Bridget Rousselin."</p>

<p>"Bridget Rousselin?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Certainly. We've got to question her."</p>

<p>"Question that woman?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that woman."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;she's&mdash;she's alive!"</p>

<p>"Well, yes; she is."</p>

<p>He rose again, pivoted on his heels once or twice in a sketchy
little dance that was half cancan, half jig, and said:</p>

<p>"I beg you, Countess of Cagliostro, not to look at me with such
furious eyes. If I hadn't given you a bit of a shock with a view to
weaken your power of resistance, you would not have whispered a
word of that interesting story; and where should we be now? One day
or other Beaumagnan would have scooped up the thousand millions and
left poor little Josephine biting her nails. So come now! A sweet
smile instead of that horrid scowl."</p>

<p>"You had the audacity...You dared...And all those threats...All
that pressure to make me speak...It was a farce! I'll never forgive
you&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes you will," he said in a cheerful, mocking tone. "You'll
forgive me all right&mdash;when you've recovered from that little
wound to your vanity. All this has nothing to do with our love, you
know. It counts for nothing between people devoted to one another,
like us. One day one scratches, next day the other...until perfect
concord is attained on every point."</p>

<p>"Always supposing a rupture does not take place first," she said
between her teeth.</p>

<p>"A rupture? A rupture merely because I've relieved you of a few
little secrets?"</p>

<p>But Josephine still looked so flabbergasted that he had to laugh
outright, and fairly dancing up and down, like a delighted child,
he went on:</p>

<p>"Lord, madam is annoyed!...And just because I've tried one of
her own little tricks on her!...Really you ought not to lose your
temper about a little thing like that...It makes me laugh."</p>

<p>She was no longer paying any attention to him. She pulled the
rug off Leonard, pulled the handkerchief out of his mouth, and cut
through his bonds.</p>

<p>Leonard leaped at Ralph, like a wild beast unchained.</p>

<p>"Don't touch him!" she cried.</p>

<p>Leonard stopped short, shaking his fist in Ralph's face.</p>

<p>"Behold the myrmidon!" said Ralph, laughing again. "Jumping up
like a jack-in-the-box!"</p>

<p>Beside himself, the man foamed at the mouth and cried: "We shall
meet again, my lad&mdash;we shall meet again&mdash;and if it isn't
for a hundred years&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You also reckon in centuries&mdash;like your mistress," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Go," said Josephine, pushing Leonard towards the door. "Go. You
will bring back the carriage."</p>

<p>They exchanged a few words quickly, in a language Ralph did not
understand; and the man went.</p>

<p>Then she turned to Ralph and said in a bitter voice: "And
now?"</p>

<p>"Now?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What do you intend to do?"</p>

<p>"My intentions are perfectly honorable&mdash;angelic in
fact&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Enough of this fooling! What do you mean to do? How do you
propose to act?" she said sharply.</p>

<p>Of a sudden serious, he said: "I promise to act very differently
from you who are always full of suspicion. I shall be what you have
never been, a loyal friend who would blush to injure you."</p>

<p>"That is to say?"</p>

<p>"That is to say I'm going to put the indispensable questions to
Bridget Rousselin, and to put them so that you can hear her
answers. Does that suit you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, but in a tone that showed that she was still
irritated.</p>

<p>"In that case, stay here. It won't take long. There's no time to
lose."</p>

<p>"No time to lose?"</p>

<p>"No. Listen and you'll understand. Don't stir."</p>

<p>Thereupon, leaving open the two doors of communication so that
every word could be heard clearly, he went to the bed on which
Bridget was lying.</p>

<p>The young actress smiled at him. In spite of her fear and of the
fact that she had not caught a sound of what had been going on, she
had at the sight of her deliverer a sense of security and
confidence very comforting.</p>

<p>"I shan't tire you," he said. "I want to ask you a few
questions. Are you in condition to answer them?"</p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>"Ah well, you have been the victim of a madman of sorts whom the
police have been watching and whom they're going to shut up. So
there is no longer any danger. But I want you to clear up a point
if you can."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"What is this bandeau set with jewels? Who did you get it from?"
he said.</p>

<p>He perceived that she hesitated. However she said: "They are
stones I found in an old casket."</p>

<p>"A wooden casket?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;all smashed and not even locked. It was hidden under
a heap of straw in a loft in the little house in the country my
mother lived in."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"At Lillebonne, between Rouen and le Havre."</p>

<p>"I know. And where did the casket come from?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never asked my mother."</p>

<p>"You found the stones in the box just as they are now?"</p>

<p>"No. They were set in large silver rings," she said.</p>

<p>"And those rings?"</p>

<p>"I had them last night in my makeup box at the theater; and a
gentleman who came behind to compliment me on my acting caught
sight of them and took a fancy to them."</p>

<p>"Was he alone?"</p>

<p>"No. He had two friends with him. It seems he is a collector;
and I let him have the rings then and there and promised to take
the stones to him today at three o'clock that he might restore them
to their original settings. He is going to give me a good price for
them."</p>

<p>"Have these rings inscriptions on the inside?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes: words in old-fashioned writing. But I never bothered about
them."</p>

<p>Ralph considered. Then he said in a very serious voice: "I
advise you to keep this business a dead secret. If you don't, it
may have very unpleasant results, not for you, but for your mother.
It's uncommonly odd that she should have rings, of no great value
in themselves perhaps, but of extraordinary historical interest,
hidden in her house."</p>

<p>Bridget was alarmed and cried: "I'm quite ready to give them
up!"</p>

<p>"There's no point in that. Take care of the stones. I'm going to
demand, in your name the restitution of the rings. Where does this
gentleman live?"</p>

<p>"Rue de Vangirard."</p>

<p>"What's his name?"</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan."</p>

<p>"Good. And one last word of advice," said Ralph. "Leave this
house. It is too isolated. And for some time&mdash;say for a
month&mdash;go and live with your maid at an hotel. And don't
receive strange visitors. Is it agreed?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>He left her, shutting the door behind him; and they went
downstairs. Josephine waited for him in the street while he
released Valentine.</p>

<p>When he came out, Josephine slipped her arm through his. She
seemed greatly disturbed and to have forgotten her anger and desire
for revenge.</p>

<p>"Do I rightly understand that you're going to his house?" she
said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan's? Yes."</p>

<p>"But it's madness!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Go to Beaumagnan's at a time when you know that the other two
are with him?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Two and one are three," he said cheerfully.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, don't go!"</p>

<p>"Why ever not? Do you suppose they'll eat me?" he said
scornfully.</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan will stick at nothing," she protested.</p>

<p>"Is he a cannibal?"</p>

<p>"There's nothing to laugh at, dear."</p>

<p>"Don't cry, my Josine."</p>

<p>He felt that her fear for him was genuine, and that in a fresh
access of tenderness, she was forgetting their disagreement.</p>

<p>"Don't go, dear," she repeated. "I know Beaumagnan's flat. Those
ruffians will attack you; and there's no chance of anyone being
able to help you."</p>

<p>"All the better, for in that case no one will be able to help
them either," he said calmly.</p>

<p>"You <i>will</i> make a joke of it, Ralph.
Nevertheless&mdash;"</p>

<p>He squeezed her arm; and said in a reassuring tone:</p>

<p>"Now, listen to me, Josine. I come into a colossal affair long
after everyone else and find yourself confronted by two powerful
organizations, yours and Beaumagnan's. Both of them, very
naturally, refuse to welcome me, the third person to share the
loot, so that either I've got to play a big game or remain
negligible. Let me then deal with our enemy Beaumagnan as I've
dealt with my little friend Josine. You must admit that I managed
her fairly well and that I have more than one string to my
bow."</p>

<p>Once more he offended her. She drew her arm out of his; walked
on side by side in silence.</p>

<p>In his heart of hearts he asked himself whether his most
relentless foe was not this gentle, pretty lady, whom he so
passionately loved and by whom he was loved so passionately.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>9. The Tarpeian Rock</h2>

<p>"Does Monsieur Beaumagnan live here?"</p>

<p>The shutter of the peephole in the door had been drawn back; and
the face of an old servant was pressed against the bars across
it.</p>

<p>"He lives here. But he is not seeing anyone," that servant said
grumpily.</p>

<p>"Go and tell him that a gentleman has come from Mademoiselle
Bridget Rousselin," said Ralph imperiously.</p>

<p>The rooms of Beaumagnan were on the ground floor of a
two-storied house. There was no janitor, no bell. There was an iron
knocker to knock at the massive door, which was pierced by this
peephole like a prison cell.</p>

<p>The servant went. Ralph waited more than five minutes. That a
man should call, when they expected the young actress in person,
was puzzling the three confederates.</p>

<p>The servant came back and said, still grumpily: "My master would
be obliged if you would send in your card, sir."</p>

<p>Ralph gave him his card.</p>

<p>There was another wait, then the noise of bolts being drawn back
and the unhooking of a chain, and Ralph was led across a hall with
a polished floor, like a convent parlor, the walls of which looked
uncommonly damp.</p>

<p>They passed two or three doors and came to a room with double
doors. The outer of these was padded with leather so that no sound
could come through it. The old servant opened it, ushered Ralph
into the room and shut the two doors, leaving him face to face with
his three enemies. He could hardly regard them as anything else,
for two of the three watched him enter with the air of boxers on
guard and ready to lead.</p>

<p>"It is him! It is indeed!" cried Godfrey d'Etigues flushing with
anger. "It's our man of the Château de Gueures! The young fellow
who stole the branch of the candlestick! Of all the infernal
impudence! What have you come for today? If it's the hand of my
daughter&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ralph laughed softly and said: "Upon my soul you don't seem able
to think of anything else, sir. My feelings for Mademoiselle
Clarice are the same as ever; and in my heart I still cherish the
same respectful hope. But the object of my visit today is no more
matrimonial than it was at Gueures."</p>

<p>"Then what the devil is your object?" stormed the Baron.</p>

<p>"That day at Gueures it was to lock you up in a cellar.
Today&mdash;"</p>

<p>Beaumagnan had to step forward hastily to prevent the Baron from
throwing himself on this intruder.</p>

<p>"Stay where you are, Godfrey! Sit down!" he cried. "Let the
young gentleman tell us what he has come for."</p>

<p>He himself sat down at his desk. Ralph dropped on to a
chair.</p>

<p>Before speaking he studied leisurely the faces of his opponents.
He perceived that they had changed since their meeting at La Haie
d'Etigues. The Baron in particular had aged. His cheeks had grown
hollow and at moments his eyes had a hunted expression which
impressed Ralph painfully. The fixed idea, the pangs of remorse can
alone produce that feverish, restless air which he observed both in
the Baron and in Beaumagnan. They could not keep their hands
still.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan however kept control of himself. If he was haunted by
the memory of Josephine's death, it was at rarer intervals than the
Baron. It had worn him less, had less thrown him off his balance.
It was only by fits and starts and at critical moments that it
unmanned him.</p>

<p>Ralph thought to himself: "If I'm going to bring this off, I
must produce such a critical moment. One or other of us has got to
give ground."</p>

<p>"What is it you want, young man?" said Beaumagnan. "The name of
Mademoiselle Rousselin has procured you admittance into my flat.
With what intention&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With the intention of continuing the conversation you had with
her at the theater last night," Ralph replied boldly.</p>

<p>The attack was indeed direct; but Beaumagnan did not flinch.</p>

<p>"I'm of the opinion that that conversation can only be continued
with her, and I was expecting no one but her," he said drily.</p>

<p>"Mademoiselle Rousselin has a good reason for not coming," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"A very good reason?" asked Beaumagnan in a politely sceptical
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes. She has been the victim of a murderous assault."</p>

<p>"Eh, what? Someone has tried to murder her? What for?" cried
Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"To take the seven stones from her as you gentlemen took the
seven rings," said Ralph coldly. The Baron and Oscar de Bennetot
jumped from their chairs. Beaumagnan showed better control of
himself; but he stared with astonished eyes at this quiet young man
whose inexplicable intervention assumed an air of arrogant
defiance. But after all this adversary looked to be of no great
importance; and he let that thought appear in the careless tone in
which he countered.</p>

<p>"This is the second time you have interfered in matters which
are no business of yours, young man. And you have interfered in a
manner which will undoubtedly compel us to give you a well-merited
lesson. The first time, at Gueures, after leading my friends into a
trap, you took possession of an object which belonged to us; and
that in ordinary language is known as larceny. Today your
aggression is even more impudent, since you come and insult us to
our faces, without the least excuse, knowing perfectly well that we
did not steal those rings, but that they were handed over to us. Do
you mind telling us what you mean by it?"</p>

<p>"You know quite well that there has been no larceny, nor
aggression on my part," said Ralph firmly. "I have only acted in a
manner entirely natural in one who is aiming at the same goal as
you yourselves."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you are aiming at the same goal as we are, are you?"
said Beaumagnan in a slightly sneering tone. "And what may that
goal be?"</p>

<p>"The discovery of the ten thousand precious stones hidden in the
block of granite."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan was indeed taken aback; and clumsily enough he showed
it plainly by his air of astonished consternation and his gaping
silence.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ralph drove his attack home, saying: "Doesn't it
follow that since the four of us are seeking the incalculable
treasure of the old monasteries, when our paths cross we come into
collision? That's what must happen."</p>

<p>The treasure of the monasteries! The block of granite! The ten
thousand precious stones! To Beaumagnan each phrase was the stroke
of a hammer. Here was another rival to be dealt with! The Countess
of Cagliostro out of the way, at once another competitor enters the
race for the millions!</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues and de Bennetot exchanged ferocious glances
and expanded their chests in the manner of athletes about to plunge
into a contest. Beaumagnan stiffened in his chair in his effort to
recover his coolness. He felt that he would need it all.</p>

<p>"Legends!" he cried scornfully, striving to keep his voice
steady and pick up the dropped thread of his ideas. "Old women's
gossip! Nursery tales! Is that what you waste your time on?"</p>

<p>"No more than you," said Ralph in a pleasant tone, not wishing
Beaumagnan to recover his balance but rather to upset him get more
thoroughly. "Everything you do has some connection or other with
this treasure. And not more than the Cardinal de Bonnechose did. I
suppose his memorandum was old women's gossip. Not more than the
dozen friends, of whom you are the leader and inspirer, do."</p>

<p>"Goodness, how well informed you are!" said Beaumagnan
ironically.</p>

<p>"Better informed a great deal than you imagine," said Ralph
quietly.</p>

<p>"And from whom did you get this precious information?" said
Beaumagnan with a sneer.</p>

<p>"From a woman."</p>

<p>"A woman?" Beaumagnan repeated: and there was a sudden note of
anxiety in his voice.</p>

<p>"From Josephine Balsamo, Countess of Cagliostro."</p>

<p>There came a groan from the Baron, a muttered oath from de
Bennetot; and Beaumagnan cried in a tone of amazed dismay:</p>

<p>"Josephine Balsamo! Then you knew her!"</p>

<p>Ralph saw his way clearly. Just to drop the name of Josephine in
the discussion had been enough to throw his enemies into the worst
confusion, and in that confusion he was resolved to keep them.
Indeed, so great was that confusion that Beaumagnan had committed
the irremediable error of speaking of her as if she were no longer
alive. Ralph smiled at him, a disquieting smile.</p>

<p>"D-D-Did you know her? When did you know her? Where? What did
she tell you?" stammered Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"I knew her at the beginning of last winter, as you did,
monsieur," said Ralph, pressing his offensive. "And I enjoyed her
acquaintance all through the winter till the very moment that I had
the pleasure of meeting the daughter of the Baron d'Etigues. I saw
her nearly every day."</p>

<p>"You lie, sir!" cried Beaumagnan. "She couldn't have seen you
every day! She would have mentioned your name. I was a sufficiently
close friend of hers for her not to have kept a secret of that kind
from me."</p>

<p>"She kept that one," said Ralph drily.</p>

<p>"It's a slander!" Beaumagnan almost shouted. "You are trying to
make us believe that an impossible intimacy existed between you and
her. One may bring many accusations against Josephine Balsamo
perhaps: accusations of coquetry, trickery but not this
one&mdash;not of an act of debauchery."</p>

<p>"Love is not an act of debauchery," said Ralph calmly.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Love! Josephine Balsamo loved you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan was beside himself. He sprang up and shook his fist
in Ralph's face. In their turn his friends had to calm him; but he
was still trembling with rage; beads of sweat stood out on his
forehead.</p>

<p>"I hold him in the hollow of my hand all right," Ralph thought
to himself. "In the matter of the crime and remorse he's as firm as
a rock. But he is still being tortured by his passion for
Josephine, and through that I shall do what I like with him."</p>

<p>For a good minute no one said anything. Beaumagnan mopped his
brow. Then, making up his mind that this enemy, for all his
delicate appearance, was not one to be rid of easily, he went on:
"We're getting away from the point. Your personal feelings for the
Countess of Cagliostro have nothing whatever to do with the matter
in hand. I return therefore to my original question: what is it you
want from us?"</p>

<p>"It's perfectly simple," said Ralph. "I can tell you in a few
words. With regard to this religious treasure of the middle ages,
which you personally want to recover for the treasury of the
Society of Jesus, this is how we stand. These offerings flowed
through channels in all the provinces into the seven principal
abbeys of the Caux country, and constituted a common fund, managed
by seven chosen administrators, of whom one only knew the
hiding-place of the treasure. Each abbey possessed an episcopal or
pastoral ring, which it handed down from generation to generation
to its own delegate. As a symbol of its mission, the Council of
Seven was represented by a candlestick with seven branches, each
branch of which was set, a relic of the Hebraic liturgy and the
temple of Moses, with a stone of the same kind and color as the
stone in the ring to which it corresponded. For example, the branch
I found at Gueures is set with a red stone, an imitation garnet,
which was the representative stone of one of the abbeys; and we
also know that Brother Nicolas, last administrator in chief of the
abbeys of the Caus country, was a monk of Fécamp abbey. Are we in
agreement so far?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Then it is enough to know the names of the seven abbeys to know
the seven places in which a search has a prospect of success. Now
seven names are inscribed on the inside of the rings which Bridget
Rousselin handed over to you at the theater last night, and it is
those seven rings I ask to examine."</p>

<p>"What?" cried Beaumagnan. "After we've been searching all these
years, you come along and claim to reach at the first shot the same
stage as we have?"</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Ralph with a cheerful grin.</p>

<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, but do you refuse? I shall only tell you, in the
event of your definite refusal."</p>

<p>"Of course I refuse!" cried Beaumagnan. "Your demand is
absolutely senseless! I refuse categorically!"</p>

<p>"Then I shall denounce you."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan was astounded. He looked at Ralph as if he were
dealing with a madman.</p>

<p>"You'll denounce me? What's this new game?"</p>

<p>"I shall denounce all three of you."</p>

<p>"All three of us?" said Beaumagnan with a chuckle. "And what are
you going to accuse us of, my young friend?"</p>

<p>"The murder of Josephine Balsamo, Countess of Cagliostro!"</p>

<p><br>
There was no word of protest, no gesture of revolt. Godfrey
d'Etigues and Oscar de Bennetot seemed to sink into paralyzed heaps
on their chairs. Beaumagnan turned livid and his chuckle ended in a
horrible grimace.</p>

<p>He rose, dashed to the door, locked it, and put the key in his
pocket. It had the effect of putting a little life into his
associates. They sat upright again.</p>

<p>Ralph had the audacity to make a joke of it: "My dear sir," he
said, "when a conscript joins his regiment they put him on a horse
without stirrups till he learns to stick on."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean that I have sworn never to carry a revolver till I find
myself confronted by a situation which I can not handle just with
the help of my brain," said Ralph. "So you are warned. I haven't
any stirrups; that is to say I haven't any revolver. You are three,
all armed; and I am alone. Therefore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Therefore, we've had enough of talk," said Beaumagnan in a
threatening tone. "It's time for facts. You accuse us of having
murdered the Countess of Cagliostro?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And you have proofs to support this monstrous accusation?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>"What are they?"</p>

<p>"A few weeks ago I was wandering about the estate of La Haie
d'Etigues, hoping to have the good fortune of meeting Mademoiselle
d'Etigues, when I saw a carriage driven by one of your friends.
This carriage went into the park. I slipped in after it. A woman,
Josephine Balsamo, was carried into the chamber in the old tower,
in which you were all gathered together; and you formed yourselves
into a tribunal of sorts. Her trial was conducted as dishonorably
and unfairly as it could be. You acted as public prosecutor,
monsieur, and you carried your treachery and vanity to the point of
letting it be believed that this woman had been your mistress. As
for these two gentlemen, they played the part of executioners."</p>

<p>"The proof! The proof!" snarled Beaumagnan, whose face had
become unrecognizable.</p>

<p>"I was present, lying in the embrasure of the window, just above
your head."</p>

<p>"It's impossible!" stammered Beaumagnan. "If it was true, you
would have made some attempt to intervene and save her!"</p>

<p>"Save her from what?" asked Ralph who naturally did not wish to
reveal anything about the rescue of Josephine. "I believed, as did
the rest of your confederates, that you had condemned her to
confinement in an English madhouse. So I went away when they did. I
hurried to Etretat. I hired a boat and rowed about waiting for the
English yacht of which you had spoken, intending to frighten the
captain into releasing the unfortunate woman. It was a vain attempt
and cost her her life. The English yacht never came. It was only
later that I understood the dastardly trick you had played and was
able to reconstitute the actual crime, in all its horror, the
descent of the priest's staircase, the scuttled boat, and the
drowning."</p>

<p>Listening in obvious terror, the three men had drawn their
chairs closer together. De Bennetot quietly pushed aside the table
which was between him and Ralph. Ralph observed the distorted
features of Godfrey d'Etigues and the snarl that bared his teeth.
Beaumagnan had but to give the signal, and he would have drawn his
revolver and blown the imprudent young man's brains out.</p>

<p>But it was this very imprudence, quite inexplicable, that stayed
Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>With a terrible air he said: "I repeat, monsieur, that you had
no right to act as you have done and meddle with things that don't
concern you. But I refuse to lie and deny the facts. Only...only I
ask myself, since you have surprised such a secret, how you dare
come here and provoke us. It's madness!"</p>

<p>"Why so, monsieur?" said Ralph simply.</p>

<p>"Because your life is in our hands."</p>

<p>Ralph shrugged his shoulders and said: "My life isn't in the
slightest danger."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless there are three of us and not at all in the mood
to disregard a matter which so closely touches our security."</p>

<p>"I run no more risk among you three than if it was your interest
to act as my defenders," said Ralph calmly.</p>

<p>"Are you absolutely certain of that?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely, since you didn't kill me the moment you heard my
story."</p>

<p>"And if I did decide to kill you?"</p>

<p>"An hour later you would all three be arrested."</p>

<p>"Nonsense!"</p>

<p>"It is as I have the honor of telling you. It's a quarter past
four. One of my friends is walking up and down in front of the
Prefecture of Police. It's a quarter past four. If I haven't
rejoined him by a quarter to five, he informs the chief
commissioner of your crime."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense!" cried Beaumagnan, who appeared to recover
confidence. "I am a well-known man. As soon as he mentions my name,
they'll laugh at him!"</p>

<p>"They'll listen to him."</p>

<p>"In the meanwhile," said Beaumagnan, turning to Godfrey
d'Etigues.</p>

<p>The order for the execution was on the point of being given.
Ralph experienced the joy of genuine peril. In a few seconds the
act, the execution of which he had retarded by his extraordinary
coolness, would be committed.</p>

<p>"There's one more thing I should like to say," he said
quietly.</p>

<p>"Speak!" growled Beaumagnan. "But on condition that it is a
definite proof against us. We've had enough of accusations. With
regard to the matter of the Countess and the view that justice may
take of it, I'll attend to that. But I want a proof which proves to
me that I'm not wasting my time discussing the matter with you. A
proof at once&mdash;if not&mdash;"</p>

<p>He rose from his chair. Ralph rose too and faced him with
imperious gripping eyes.</p>

<p>"Proof or death&mdash;that's what you mean, isn't it?" he
said.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, my answer is: the seven rings! At once! If
not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If not?"</p>

<p>"My friend hands over to the chief commissioner the letter which
you wrote to the Baron d'Etigues, instructing him how to capture
Josephine Balsamo and ordering him to murder her."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan pretended to be surprised: "A letter? Instructions to
murder?" he said.</p>

<p>Ralph went into details; he said: "Yes, a letter in a kind of
code, in which you get at the real meaning by ignoring a number of
interposed sentences."</p>

<p>"Oh, that scrawl&mdash;I remember&mdash;yes," said Beaumagnan
carelessly.</p>

<p>"A scrawl which constitutes the irrefutable proof you asked
for," said Ralph coldly.</p>

<p>"Of course&mdash;of course&mdash;I admit it," said Beaumagnan
ironically. "Only I'm not a schoolboy; and I take precautions. That
letter was given back to me by the Baron at the beginning of the
meeting. I burned it."</p>

<p>"You burned the copy that was given to you. I took the
precaution of keeping the original myself. I found it in the secret
drawer of the Baron's rolltop desk. It is the original that my
friend will hand over to the police."</p>

<p>The ring that had formed round Ralph broke. The savage faces of
the Baron and his cousins no longer expressed anything but fear and
anguish. Ralph gathered that the duel was at an end, and that
without any real struggle&mdash;just a few feints and thrusts and
parries. He had handled the affair with such skill and by his
adroitness manoeuvred Beaumagnan into such a tragic situation,
that, in the condition of mind in which he found himself, he could
no longer get a clear view of the facts or discern his adversary's
weak points. For after all, with regard to this letter of which
Ralph declared he had the original: on what did that assertion
rest? On nothing whatever. So that it had finally come about that
Beaumagnan, after having demanded of Ralph an irrefutable proof
before giving way, had by a singular anomaly, under the young man's
adroit pressure, remained quite content with his bare
assertion.</p>

<p>He gave ground quite suddenly without any effort to make terms.
He opened a drawer, took out the seven rings, and said simply:
"What assurance have I that you will not use that letter against
us?"</p>

<p>"You have my word, monsieur," said Ralph. "Besides, where we are
concerned circumstances never repeat themselves exactly&mdash;next
time you will find a way of getting the upper hand."</p>

<p>"You may be sure of that, young man," said Beaumagnan; and he
ground his teeth.</p>

<p>Ralph seized the rings with a trembling hand. Each of them had
indeed a name engraved on its inside. On a scrap of paper he wrote
quickly down the names of the seven abbeys:</p>

<p>Fécamp, Saint-Wandrille, Jumièges, Valmont, Gruchet le Valasse,
Montvilliers, Saint-Georges de Boscherville.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan rang the bell. But when the servant came he bade him
wait in the hall, and turning to Ralph, he said:</p>

<p>"Just one thing more: I'll make you an offer. You know the task
we have set ourselves. You know exactly the point to which our
efforts have brought us, and that the end is not so very far
off?"</p>

<p>"That is my opinion," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, do you feel disposed&mdash;I'm not going to beat about
the bush&mdash;to cast in your lot with us?"</p>

<p>"On the same terms as your friends?"</p>

<p>"No. On same terms as myself."</p>

<p>The offer was bona fide; Ralph felt that it was; he was
flattered by the tribute. Perhaps he would have accepted it, if it
had not been for Josephine. But any alliance between her and
Beaumagnan was out of the question.</p>

<p>"Thank you," he said gravely. "But for reasons into which I
cannot enter, I must refuse."</p>

<p>"You are an enemy then?"</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, a competitor."</p>

<p>"No: an enemy," Beaumagnan insisted. "And as such
liable&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Liable to be treated as was the Countess of Cagliostro," Ralph
interjected.</p>

<p>"You've said it, monsieur. You know that the greatness of our
end excuses the means which we are sometimes compelled to employ.
If we employ them in your case, you will have yourself to thank for
it."</p>

<p>"I shall," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan opened the door and said to the servant: "Show this
gentleman out."</p>

<p>Ralph bowed to his three enemies and went across the hall. The
servant opened the door with the peephole in it.</p>

<p>"Half a minute, my man," said Ralph.</p>

<p>He went lightly back to the door of the study, opened it to find
the three confederates conferring, and with his hand on the handle
of the door, and the path of escape clear, said in the most amiable
accents:</p>

<p>"With regard to that famous compromising letter, I think I ought
to tell you that I did not really take a copy of it, and that
consequently my friend does <i>not</i> hold the original. And do
you really think that that story about his walking up and down in
front of the Prefecture, ready to dash in, if I don't turn up at a
quarter to five, sounds probable? Goodbye, gentlemen. Sleep well.
I'm looking forward to our next meeting."</p>

<p>He slammed the door in Beaumagnan's face and gained the street
before he got it open.</p>

<p>He had won the second battle.</p>

<p><br>
At the end of the street Josephine was waiting for him in a
cab.</p>

<p>"Drive to Saint Lazare station, main line departure platform,"
he said to the cabman.</p>

<p>He jumped into the cab, quivering with delight, and said in the
accents of a conqueror: "Here you are, darling&mdash;the seven
indispensable names. Here's the list of them. Take it."</p>

<p>"And now?" she said.</p>

<p>"Well, there they are&mdash;the second victory in one day and
what a victory! Goodness how easy it is to get the better of
people! A little audacity, a clear head, careful reasoning, and a
firm resolve to go as straight as an arrow to your goal, and
obstacles clear out of your way of themselves. Beaumagnan is a
smart chap, isn't he? Well, he crumpled up just as you did, my
pretty Josine. Your pupil does you honor, doesn't he? Two
first-class masters, Beaumagnan and Cagliostro's daughter smashed
and pulverized in one day by a collegian! What do you think of
that, Josine?"</p>

<p>He paused in his paean to say: "You're not angry with me for
rubbing it in like this?"</p>

<p>"No, no," she said, smiling at him.</p>

<p>"And you're not angry about that little business at Bridget
Rousselin's?"</p>

<p>"Don't you ask too much of me," she warned him. "It's better not
to wound my pride. I've plenty of it and I'm vindictive. But after
all one can't go on being angry with you for long. There's
something peculiar about you which disarms one."</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan isn't disarmed, I'll be hanged if he is," he said
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan is a man," she said.</p>

<p>"Well, I will make war on men; and I really believe that that's
what I'm cut out for, for conquest, for the extraordinary and the
fabulous. I feel that there is no situation from which I cannot
emerge with honor. And it is tempting to fight when one is sure of
victory, isn't it, Josine?"</p>

<p>Along the narrow streets on the left bank of the Seine the cab
made its way at a good pace. They crossed the river.</p>

<p>"And from today I shall be victorious, Josine! I have all the
trumps in my hand. In a few hours I reach Lillebonne. I unearth the
Widow Rousselin, and, whether she like it or not, I examine the
sandalwood casket on which the keyword is carved; and there we are.
With that word and with the names of the seven abbeys, it will
indeed be odd if I don't carry off the cup!"</p>

<p>Josephine laughed at his enthusiasm. He was exultant. He told
her about his duel with Beaumagnan, kissed her, cocked snooks at
the people they passed, opened the window and jeered at the cabman
because his horse trotted like a snail.</p>

<p>"Make him gallop, old idiot! What? You have the honor of driving
in your chariot the god of Fortune and the queen of beauty and your
steed doesn't gallop!"</p>

<p>The cab went along the Avenue de l'Opera. It took the shortcut
through the Rue des Petit-Champs and the Rue des Capucines. In the
Rue Caumartin the horse did break into a gallop.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" cried Ralph. "Twelve to five; and we're nearly
there. Of course it's understood that you come with me to
Lillebonne?"</p>

<p>"Whatever for? There's no point in it. It's sufficient for one
of us to go," she replied.</p>

<p>"As you like," said Ralph. "You trust me and you know that I
shall not betray that trust and that we are allies&mdash;the
victory of the one is the victory of the other."</p>

<p>But just as they came to the corner of the Rue Auber, the door
of a courtyard on their left was thrown open, and without slowing
up the cab ran through it.</p>

<p>Three men appeared at either door, Ralph was gripped and roughly
dragged away before he could even make a show of resistance.</p>

<p>He heard Josephine, who had remained in the cab, say: "Saint
Lazare Station! And be quick about it!"</p>

<p>The six men rushed him into the house, shoved him into a badly
lighted room, and locked its massive door on him.</p>

<p><br>
The exaltation which Ralph had been enjoying did not immediately
abate. He went on laughing and joking, but in a growing fury and in
tones that changed as it grew.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Josephine!...But what a masterstroke!...What a shot!
Right in the middle of the bull's-eye and when I was least
expecting it...How funny she must have found my songs of triumph!
'I am cut out for conquest, for the extraordinary and the
fabulous!' Idiot that I was! When one is capable of such blunders,
one should keep one's mouth shut. What a smash!"</p>

<p>He flung himself on the door. What was the use? It was the door
of a cell. He tried to jump up to the little window which let in
that dim light. There was no way of reaching it.</p>

<p>Then a noise caught his ear; and he perceived that a loophole
had been cut in the corner of the wall, just under the ceiling, and
that the barrel of a rifle was pointing at him, and that it
followed his every movement.</p>

<p>All his anger turned on the invisible marksman; and he abused
him freely.</p>

<p>"Hog! Guttersnipe! Come out of that hole, and I'll show you! A
nice job yours is! Go and tell your mistress that she's hardly on
the way to heaven yet, and that before long&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped short. It was a stupid waste of words. Then, passing
suddenly from the height of fury to a quiet resignation, he lay
down on a bed in an alcove which was fitted up as a
dressing-room.</p>

<p>"You can kill me if you like," he said. "But don't stop me going
to sleep."</p>

<p>Really he never dreamed of going to sleep. The first thing was
to consider his situation quietly and draw from it conclusions
which promised to be uncommonly disagreeable. In fact, they could
be summed up in a few words. Josephine Balsamo had substituted
herself for him, with the intention of reaping the fruits of his
victory.</p>

<p>But what an organization she must have to be able to act so
successfully in so little time! Ralph had no doubt that Leonard,
accompanied by a confederate, had followed them to Beaumagnan's
house and while he was in it had arranged with her the trap into
which he had so simply fallen. This house must have been specially
fitted up for such a purpose.</p>

<p>What could he do at his age against such enemies? On the one
hand, Beaumagnan, with a whole world of correspondents and
associates behind him; on the other hand, Josephine Balsamo, with
so powerful and so well organized a gang.</p>

<p>He made a resolution. He said to himself: "Whether later I enter
upon the straight path, as I hope to do, or whether, as is more
probable, I keep on the path of adventure, I will equip myself with
this indispensable organization! Woe to those who work by
themselves! It is only leader of gangs who attain their ends. I
mastered Josephine. Nevertheless, it is she who tonight will lay
hands on the precious casket, while Ralph is groaning in his prison
cell."</p>

<p>He had reached this point in his meditations when he found that
an inexplicable torpor was invading him. It was accompanied by a
feeling of general discomfort. He struggled against this unusual
drowsiness, but his brain became clouded very quickly. At the same
time he felt sick, and his stomach began to ache.</p>

<p>By a strong effort he shook off his drowsiness and walked across
the room. But the heaviness increased. Of a sudden he threw himself
down on the bed, a prey to a horrible thought. He remembered that
in the cab Josephine had taken from her pocket a little gold
sweetmeat box which she always carried, and as she ate two or three
chocolates had, with an apparently mechanical gesture, offered him
one.</p>

<p>"She has poisoned me!" he murmured, breaking into a cold sweat.
"That sweet she gave me was poisoned!" He had no time to consider
the truth of this suggestion. In an access of giddiness he seemed
to topple into a great hole, and sank into oblivion.</p>

<p>Such a strong belief that he was dying had taken possession of
him that, when he opened his eyes, he was not sure that he was
alive. He took several deep and rather painful breaths, pinched
himself, and spoke out loud. He was alive. The distant noises of
the street confirmed him in his belief.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm not dead," he said to himself. "But what a high
opinion I've got of the woman I love! On account of a wretched
narcotic she administered to me, as she had every right to do, I
accuse her of poisoning me."</p>

<p>He could not tell how long he had been asleep&mdash;one day, or
two, or more? His head was heavy; his mind was wandering; and his
limbs were aching with a violent cramp. At the bottom of the wall
he saw a basket of food which must have been let down through the
loophole. No rifle was visible.</p>

<p>He was hungry and thirsty. He ate and drank. Such was his
lassitude that he did not take the trouble to consider what might
be the consequences of that meal. A narcotic? Poison? What did it
matter? A passing sleep, or the sleep eternal, it made no
difference to him. He went back to bed and fell asleep again for
hours, for nights, for days.</p>

<p>In the end he came out of this deep slumber to become aware of
certain sensations, much in the fashion in which one perceives
gleams of light at the end of a tunnel. They were rather agreeable
sensations. They were doubtless dreams, dreams of a pleasant
rocking, accompanied by a continuous, rhythmical sound. At last he
opened his eyes; then he perceived a framed picture, the canvas of
which was covered with perpetually changing landscapes, shining or
dark, full of sunlight or bathed in a golden mist.</p>

<p>Now he had only to stretch out his hand to find food. He began
to enjoy the flavor of it more and more. He washed it down with a
wine of a very delicate aroma. It seemed to him that, as he drank
it, energy flowed into him. His eyes grew clear; the picture frame
became an open window through which he saw a procession of hills
and spires of village churches.</p>

<p>He found himself in quite another room, a small room, in which
he had lived before, with his clothes and his books about him.</p>

<p>A stepladder rose at one side of it. Why did he not go up it
since he had the strength? It merely needed an effort of will. He
made the effort and mounted it. His head rose into the open air. A
river flowed on his left and right. He murmured:</p>

<p>"The deck of the <i>Nonchalante</i>...The Seine...the
Deux-Amants country."</p>

<p>He walked aft. Josine was there, sitting in a wicker work chair.
There was really no transition between the combative rancor and
revolt he had felt and the access of passion and desire which shook
him at the sight of her. Had he, indeed, really felt any rancor and
revulsion? Everything was drowned in an immense need to clasp her
in his arms.</p>

<p>Enemy? Thief? Criminal if you like. But, after all, only a
woman&mdash;above all, woman. And what a woman!</p>

<p>Dressed, as usual, in a simple frock, she was wearing that
delicate veil which softened the luster of her hair and gave her so
close a resemblance to the Virgin of Bernardino Luini. Her neck, of
a warm creaminess, was bare. Her slender hands lay clasped in her
lap. She was gazing at the abrupt slope of the Deux-Amants. And
nothing could appear sweeter and more innocent than that face on
which rested that perpetual, profound, and mysterious, smile.</p>

<p>Ralph was almost touching her at the moment at which she
perceived him. She flushed slightly and lowered her eyelids, and
she seemed not to dare to let her eyes rest on him through her long
brown eyelashes. Never did a young girl display greater shyness and
ingenuous timidity, less affectation and coquetry.</p>

<p>He was deeply touched by it. She feared this first meeting with
him. Was he not going to abuse her, to throw himself on her, strike
her, and heap abominable epithets on her? Or was he going to leave
her with that scorn which is the worst of all things?</p>

<p>Ralph was trembling like a child. At the actual moment nothing
counted with him but that which counts eternally with
lovers&mdash;the kiss, the hands that clasp, the frenzy of glances
that fail and of lips that faint with pleasure.</p>

<p>He fell on his knees before her.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>10. The Mutilated Hand</h2>

<p>The penalty of such loves is the silence to which they are
condemned. Even when the mouths are speaking, the noise of the
words they exchange does not break the heavy silence of the inner,
solitary thoughts. Each follows his, or her, course of thought
without ever penetrating into the very life of the other. A
dispiriting intercourse from which Ralph, always so ready to
expand, suffered more and more.</p>

<p>Josephine too must have been suffering from it, to judge from
certain moments of extreme lassitude in which she seemed on the
verge of those confidences that draw lovers closer than do
embraces. Once she began to weep in Ralph's arms so bitterly that
he looked for an access of surrender. But she recovered almost at
once, and he felt her further away from him than ever.</p>

<p>"She cannot trust," he told himself. "She is one of those beings
who dwell apart from their fellows in a solitude that has no
bounds. She is a prisoner of the image she has formed of herself,
has forced herself to form of herself; indeed, a prisoner of the
enigma she has elaborated and which holds her in its invisible
meshes. As the daughter of Cagliostro she has acquired the habit of
the darkness, of the intricate, of plots, intrigues, and
subterranean operations. To tell anyone the story of one of these
machinations is to give him the thread which will guide him through
the labyrinth. She is afraid and withdraws into herself."</p>

<p>By way of counter-stroke he kept silence himself and refrained
from making any allusion to the adventure on which they had
embarked, or to the problem of which they were seeking the
solution. Had she obtained possession of the casket? Did she know
the key-word? Had she plunged her hand into the hollow in that
legendary block and emptied it of those thousands and thousands of
precious stones?</p>

<p>On that matter, on every matter, silence.</p>

<p>Moreover, after they had passed Rouen, their intimacy slackened.
Leonard, avoiding Ralph, reappeared again. The secret meetings
began once more. The carriage and the untiring little horses every
day carried Josine away. Whither? On what enterprizes? Ralph
observed that three of the abbeys, Saint-Georges, Jumièges, and
Saint-Wandrille, were close to the river. But then, if she were
searching in this quarter, it must be that no solution had yet been
found, and that she had simply failed.</p>

<p>This notion drove him abruptly to action. He sent to the inn
near La Haie d'Etigues for his bicycle, and rode across the country
to the outskirts of Lillebonne, in which Bridget Rousselin's mother
was living. There he learned that a fortnight before&mdash;which
was about the time that Josine had taken the train from
Paris&mdash;the Widow Rousselin had shut her house and gone, so
they said, to join her daughter in Paris. The evening before a lady
had come to see her.</p>

<p>It was ten o'clock at night before Ralph got back to the barge
which was moored to the southwest of the first curve beyond Rouen.
A little while before reaching it he passed Josine's carriage,
which the little horses, utterly exhausted, could scarcely drag
along. When it came to the bank of the river Leonard jumped down
from the box, opened the door, bent down, stood up with the inert
body of the fainting Josine in his arms, and carried her to the
barge. Ralph lent a hand, and the two of them carried her down to
her cabin. The woman of the barge came to tend her.</p>

<p>"Look after her," said Leonard roughly. "She has only fainted.
But you're all to stay on board, and don't you forget it!"</p>

<p>He went back to the carriage and drove off.</p>

<p>Josine was delirious most of the night, but Ralph could make no
sense of her incoherent utterances. Next morning she had nearly
recovered. Next evening Ralph went to the nearest village to buy a
newspaper. He read among the local news:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Yesterday afternoon, the police of Caudebec,
on receiving information that a woodcutter had heard the screams of
a woman appealing for help from an old limekiln on the outskirts of
Maulevrier Forest, sent a sergeant and a constable to enquire into
the matter. As these two representatives of the law approached the
clearing in which the limekiln stands, they perceived over the
fence two men who were dragging a woman towards a closed carriage
beside which another woman was standing. Compelled to make the
circuit of the fence, the police only reached the scene of action
after the departure of the carriage. They at once started in
pursuit of it, a pursuit which should have ended in the success of
the police. But the horses drawing the carriage were so swift and
the driver's knowledge of the lanes and byways of so extensive,
that he succeeded in throwing them off his track in the network of
roads to the north between Caudebec and Motteville. Moreover the
night was coming on; and they have not yet succeeded in
ascertaining in which direction this nice little gang escaped.</p>

<p>"And they will not succeed," said Ralph to himself. "Nobody but
me can reconstitute the facts since nobody but me knows the points
of departure and arrival."</p>

<p>He formulated the following conclusions:</p>

<p>"One fact is certain: Mother Rousselin was in that old limekiln
in charge of a confederate.</p>

<p>"Secondly, Josine and Leonard, who lured her away from
Lillebonne and shut her up, go to see her every day and try to
extract some definite information from her. Yesterday the
questioning was doubtless rather violent. Mother Rousselin yells;
the police arrive. A desperate flight. They get away. Somewhere on
their route they deposit their captive in another prison, already
prepared for her; and once more they are safe. All these emotions
brought about Josine's attack of nerves."</p>

<p>He studied an ordnance map of the route from Maulevrier Forest
to the <i>Nonchalante</i>. The direct route was thirty kilometers;
somewhere off that route, at some distance to the left or to the
right Madam Rousselin was imprisoned. "Come," he said to himself,
"the terrain of the conflict is marked out. It's about time that I
made my entry on to the stage."</p>

<p>Next day he got to work, wandering along the Normandy roads,
questioning the dwellers on them and trying to discover the points
of the passage and the halting-places of "an old barouche drawn by
two little horses." Logically and inevitably his quest must come to
a successful end.</p>

<p>During those days the love of Ralph and Josephine Balsamo was at
its keenest and most passionate. The young woman, knowing that the
police were on her track, and remembering what she had heard at the
Vasseur Inn, at Doudeville, did not dare to leave the
<i>Nonchalante</i> and traverse the Caux country. So after every
expedition Ralph found her on the barge, and they threw themselves
into one another's arms with an exasperated desire to enjoy to the
full the delights which, they foresaw, must soon come to an
end.</p>

<p>Only such dolorous delights as two lovers on the verge of
separation can have. Suspect delights that doubt poisoned. Either
of them divined the secret designs of the other, and even as their
lips met either knew that the other, for all their love, was acting
as if they were at daggers drawn.</p>

<p>"I love you! I love you!" Ralph reiterated desperately while his
inmost thought was how to find means of snatching Bridget's mother
from the talons of his mistress.</p>

<p>Sometimes they gripped one another with the violence of two
creatures veritably battling with one another. There was a
brutality in their caresses, a threat in their eyes, hate in their
hearts, and despair in their tenderness. One would have said that
they were watching one another to discover the weak point at which
to strike with the deadliest effect.</p>

<p>One night Ralph awoke with a sensation of extreme discomfort to
find Josephine at his bedside, with a lamp in her hand, looking
down on him. He shivered. Not that her charming face wore other
than its usual smiling expression. But why did that smile seem to
him so wicked and so cruel?</p>

<p>"What's the matter? What do you want?" he said sharply.</p>

<p>"Nothing&mdash;nothing," she said in careless accents, and she
left him.</p>

<p>But she came back presently to show him a photograph.</p>

<p>"I found this in your pocketbook," she said. "I could hardly
believe that you carried about with you another woman's photograph.
Who is it?"</p>

<p>It was the photograph of Clarice d'Etigues. He hesitated, then
said: "I don't know. It's a photo I picked up."</p>

<p>"Come: don't lie!" she said brusquely. "It's Clarice d'Etigues.
Do you suppose I've never seen her? You were in love with her."</p>

<p>"No! Never!" he said firmly.</p>

<p>"You <i>were</i> in love with her, and she with you. I'm certain
of it. And it is still going on."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders, but as he was about to defend the
young girl, Josephine broke in:</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear anything more about it. You're warned, and
it's just as well. I'm not going out of my way to look for her, but
if she ever crosses my path&mdash;all the worse for her."</p>

<p>"And all the worse for you, if you touch a hair of her head!" he
exclaimed imprudently.</p>

<p>She paled. Her lips quivered, and laying her hand on his neck,
she stammered: "You dare to take her part against me...against
me!"</p>

<p>Her hand, very cold, contracted. He had the impression that she
was going to strangle him and sprang out of bed. In her turn she
was alarmed, thinking that he was going to strike her, and snatched
from her bodice a little dagger with gleaming blade.</p>

<p>In these attitudes of attack they stared into one another's
eyes, and it was so painful that Ralph murmured:</p>

<p>"Oh, Josine, what a pity it is that it should have come to
this!"</p>

<p>No less moved, she sank into a chair, and he threw himself at
her feet.</p>

<p>"Kiss me, Ralph&mdash;kiss me&mdash;and don't let's think
anything more about it!" she murmured in a broken voice.</p>

<p>They clasped one another in a feverish embrace. But he observed
that she still held the poniard, and a very slight movement would
have driven it into his neck.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the next morning he left the
<i>Nonchalante</i>.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to hope from her," he told himself. "As for
love: she loves me indeed, and sincerely; and she wishes, as I do,
that this love was without reserves. But it cannot be. She has a
hostile soul. She distrusts everything and everybody, and me above
all."</p>

<p>At bottom he found her impenetrable. In spite of all his
suspicions and, for that matter, of considerable evidence, even
though the very spirit of evil dwelt in her, he refused to admit
that she would go to the length of actual crime. He could not
reconcile the idea of murder with that sweet face, which neither
hate nor anger rendered less sweet. No: Josephine's hands were not
stained with blood. But he thought of Leonard and never doubted
that he was capable of putting Bridget's mother to the most
terrible torture.</p>

<p class="cp">* * *</p>

<p>The short road from Rouen to Duclair, a little before the latter
place, runs between the meadows on the bank of the Seine to the
cliff which hangs over the stream. Caves have been hollowed in the
actual chalk and serve the peasants as tool-houses and sometimes as
lodgings for themselves. It came about that Ralph at last noticed
that one of these caves was occupied by three men who were weaving
baskets from the osiers of the neighboring stream. A small
hedgeless vegetable garden lay in front of it.</p>

<p>A careful study of their habits and some suspicious details led
him to suppose that father Corbu and his two sons, poachers and
petty thieves with an uncommonly bad reputation, were affiliated
with that band the members of which Josephine always had ready to
her hand, and also to suppose that this cave of theirs was one of
those refuges&mdash;inns, sheds, limekilns, and so forth, which
Josephine had established all about the country.</p>

<p>He had to change his surmise into a certainty without attracting
anyone's attention. He tried therefore to turn the enemy's
position, and climbing on to the cliff, took his way from the river
by a woodland path which dipped into a slight depression. At the
bottom of the depression he crawled through the bushes and briars
to a spot five or six feet above the cave.</p>

<p>He had brought food and drink with him and there he spent two
days and two nights. Concealed by the bushes and the thick grass
under them, he took an unobtrusive part in the life of the three
men. On the second day a conversation he overheard proved
uncommonly enlightening: the Corbu family had been in charge of
Madam Rousselin and since the flight from Maulevrier Forest were
actually keeping her at the end of their cave.</p>

<p>How was he to set her free? Or how, at any rate, was he to get
near her and obtain from the unfortunate woman the information
which she had doubtless refused Josephine? Carefully considering
the habits of the Corbus, he formed and rejected several plans. But
on the morning of the third day he saw the <i>Nonchalante</i>
descend the river and come to her moorings at the foot of the
cliff, about three-quarters of a mile from the cave.</p>

<p>At five o'clock in the evening two people came across the
gangway and along the riverbank. In spite of her peasant's dress,
he recognized Josephine by her walk. Leonard was her companion.</p>

<p>They stopped in front of the Corbus' cave and conversed with
them as with persons on whom they had chanced by accident. Then,
since there was no one on the road, they went sharply into the
garden. Leonard disappeared into the interior of the cave.
Josephine remained outside, sitting on an old and rickety chair,
under the cover of a screen of shrubs.</p>

<p>Old Corbus hoed away at his garden. His sons went on with their
basket-work.</p>

<p>"The questioning is going to begin again," murmured Ralph. "What
a pity it is I cannot be present at it!"</p>

<p>He watched Josephine, whose face was almost entirely hidden
under the drooping brim of a large, common straw hat, of the kind
that peasants wear during the hot weather. She never stirred; she
was leaning forward a little with her elbows on her knees.</p>

<p>The minutes slipped by and Ralph began to ask himself what he
was doing there, when all at once he fancied he heard a groan close
by, which was followed by smothered cries. Yes, they certainly came
from close beside him. The sounds rose, indeed, from the middle of
the thick grass which surrounded him. How was it possible?</p>

<p>He crawled to the point at which the noise seemed loudest, and
it took him a very little time to understand what was happening.
The edge of the cliff, in which the hollow ended, was covered with
stones, and among these stones was a little heap of bricks hardly
noticeable among the bushes and roots. It was the ruins of a
chimney.</p>

<p>That explained the phenomenon which had surprised him. The cave
of the Corbus must come to an end a long way in the rock; and there
must be a passage running down to it which had formerly served as a
chimney. Through this passage and the heap of bricks the sounds
came.</p>

<p>There came two louder cries of agony. Ralph thought of
Josephine. By turning round he could still see her at the end of
the little garden. Still sitting, bent forward, her body
motionless, she was carelessly pulling the petals off a capucine.
Ralph supposed, or rather tried to suppose, that she had not heard
those cries. Perhaps even she knew nothing about what was going on.
In spite of that he trembled with indignation. Whether or no she
actually had a part in the terrible questioning that the
unfortunate woman was undergoing, was she any the less to blame?
And all the obstinate doubts in his mind, by which she had profited
up to then, ought they not to vanish in the face of the implacable
reality? Everything that he had felt to her prejudice, everything
that he had refused to know was true, since she must have
definitely set Leonard to the task with which he was busy and of
which she had been unable to endure the horrible spectacle.</p>

<p>Carefully but quickly Ralph pulled aside the bricks and scooped
away the heap of earth. When he had finished the cries had ceased,
but the sound of words came to his ears hardly louder than a
whisper. He had, therefore, to continue his work and clear the
upper part of the passage. Then, lying with his head well down in
it, he could hear distinctly. Two voices were speaking in
turn&mdash;the voice of Leonard and a woman's voice, without doubt
the voice of Madam Rousselin. The unfortunate woman seemed to be at
the end of her strength and a prey to indescribable terror.</p>

<p>"Yes...yes," she murmured, "I'm going to tell you, since I said
I would. But I'm so worn out you must excuse me, good
gentleman...Besides...All these things happened such a long time
ago...Twenty-two years have passed since..."</p>

<p>"Stop babbling and come to the point!" growled Leonard.</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied. "I am coming to the point. It was at the
time of the war with Prussia, twenty-two years ago...And as the
Prussians were advancing on Rouen, where we were living, two
gentlemen came to my poor husband, who was a carrier...gentlemen
whom we had never seen before. They wished to get out of the
country, with their trunks, like a great many other people at that
time, you know. My husband accepted their offer and without wasting
any more time, for they were in a hurry, set out with them in his
carrier's cart. Unfortunately, owing to the fact that our other
horses had been requisitioned, we had only one horse, and that one
wasn't up to much. Besides, it was snowing...Seven miles out of
Rouen he fell down and could not get up again...The gentlemen were
shivering with fear, for the Prussians might turn up at any moment.
It was then that a man from Rouen, who my husband knew quite well,
a confidential servant of the Cardinal de Bonnechose&mdash;Monsieur
Jaubert his name was&mdash;drove up in a dogcart...You can see what
happened...They talked...The two gentlemen offered him a large sum
for his horse...Jaubert refused. They begged him, and then they
threatened him...And then they threw themselves on him like madmen,
and in spite of the prayers of my husband, knocked him on the
head...After that they looked into his dogcart, found in it a
casket, which they took, harnessed Jaubert's horse to the carrier's
cart, and went off leaving the poor man half dead."</p>

<p>"Quite dead," said Leonard more accurately.</p>

<p>"Yes: my husband learned that months later, when he was able to
enter Rouen again."</p>

<p>"And didn't he inform the police about it?"</p>

<p>Madam Rousselin appeared to hesitate; then she said: "Yes...No
doubt he ought to have done perhaps...Only&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Only they'd bought his silence, hadn't they?" sneered Leonard.
"They opened the casket in front of him and found jewels in it and
gave your husband his share of the loot."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes...the rings...the seven rings," she said. "But
that wasn't his reason for keeping silence...The poor man was ill.
He died a little while after he came back from Rouen."</p>

<p>"And that casket?"</p>

<p>"It was left in the empty cart so that my husband brought it
back with the rings. I kept silence, as he had done. It was already
an old story, and I was afraid of the scandal, too...They might
have accused my husband. It was just as well to keep my mouth shut.
I went away to Lillebonne with my daughter, and it was only when
Bridget left me to go on the stage that she took the rings...which
for my part I never wanted to touch...That's the whole story,
Monsieur. Don't ask me anything else."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, the whole story?" said Leonard, and he
sneered again.</p>

<p>"It's all I know," said the widow fearfully.</p>

<p>"But I've no interest in that precious story of yours. What
we're quarreling about is another thing...As you very well
know."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"The letters carved on the inside of the casket, on the
lid&mdash;that's the whole point of the business."</p>

<p>"Those half rubbed-out letters! I swear to you, good gentleman,
I never even dreamed of trying to make them out."</p>

<p>"That's all right, and I'm quite willing to believe it," said
Leonard. "But then we come again to the original point: what has
become of the casket?"</p>

<p>"I've told you. It was taken from me&mdash;the evening before
you came to Lillebonne with the lady, the lady who wore a thick
veil."</p>

<p>"It was taken from you, was it? Who by?"</p>

<p>"By a person of my acquaintance."</p>

<p>"A person who was looking for it?" said Leonard sharply.</p>

<p>"No. That person saw it on the top of a cupboard in my
sitting-room and fancied it as a curio," said the widow.</p>

<p>"What was that person's name&mdash;for the hundredth
time&mdash;what was that person's name? That's what I want to
know," stormed Leonard.</p>

<p>"I can't tell you that. It was someone who has been very kind to
me, and to tell would only do harm great harm. I will not
tell."</p>

<p>"But, you old fool, that person would be the first to tell you
to speak!"</p>

<p>"Perhaps&mdash;perhaps. But how am I to know that? I cannot
write...We see one another from time to time...Why, we were to meet
next Tuesday, at two o'clock."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"It's impossible...I'd no right&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What? Have we got to begin all over again?" growled Leonard
impatiently.</p>

<p>The widow cried in a voice of terror: "No, no! good gentleman! I
beg you!"</p>

<p>The words ended in a cry of pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, the brute!...What is he doing to me? Oh! my poor hand!"</p>

<p>"Speak, then, curse you!"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes...I will!...I will!"</p>

<p>But she broke off short; her voice gave out. She was at the end
of her strength. Leonard, however, went on pressing her and Ralph
caught some words painfully uttered: "Yes...we're to meet on
Tuesday...at the old lighthouse...But, no!...I have no right!...I
would rather die!...You can do what you like!...I'd rather
die!"</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>Leonard growled: "What's the matter with the pigheaded old beast
now? She's not dead I hope. Oh, you old donkey, you shall speak!
I'll give you ten minutes and then I'll make an end of it."</p>

<p>A door was opened and then shut. Doubtless he was going to
inform Josephine of the admissions he had so far obtained and to
get instructions from her as to the course the rest of the
questioning was to take. Ralph pulled his head out of the chimney
and saw him go to her and stand over her. He talked to her with
excited gestures; she listened to him.</p>

<p>"The brutes!" Ralph execrated both of them, the one no less than
the other. The groans of Madam Rousselin had moved him profoundly
and he was trembling with rage and burning to act. Nothing in the
world should prevent him from rescuing this woman.</p>

<p>As was his custom, he started to act the moment that the vision
of the things that he must accomplish unfolded itself before him in
logical sequence. In these cases hesitation is apt to spoil
everything. Success depends on the audacity with which one forces
one's way through obstacles that as yet one does not even know. He
glanced at his adversaries. All five of them were some distance
from the cave. Quickly he went down the chimney, this time feet
foremost. It was his intention to make his way down the crumbling
shaft as gently as possible. But almost on the instant he went down
at full speed accompanied by most of its crumbling walls and
arrived at the bottom with a bump and the crash of falling stones
and bricks.</p>

<p>"Hang it all! If only they didn't hear it outside!" he said to
himself.</p>

<p>He listened. No one was coming. The darkness was so great that
he believed himself to be still on the hearth. But stretching out
his arms he found that the chimney had landed him in a little
chamber hollowed out of the end of the cave and so small that his
hand immediately touched another hand which almost seemed to be on
fire. His eyes grew used to the darkness; and he saw gleaming eyes
fixed on him in a gray and haggard face contorted with terror. She
was not bound or gagged. What use would it have been? Her weakness
and terror rendered escape impossible.</p>

<p>He bent down and said to her: "Don't be frightened, I saved the
life of your daughter, Bridget, who was also a victim of these
people who are persecuting you on account of the casket and the
rings. I've been on their track ever since they took you from
Lillebonne. I'm going to save you too, but on condition that you
never say a word about what has happened to anyone."</p>

<p>But what was the use of explanations that the unfortunate woman
was incapable of understanding? Without wasting any more time, he
picked her up and hoisted her on to his shoulder. Then he walked to
the mouth of the cave and quietly opened the door which was not
locked as he expected.</p>

<p>A little way off Leonard and Josephine were still talking,
behind them, at the bottom of the garden the white road stretched
away to the large village of Duclair; and on it were the carts of
the countryfolk, coming and going.</p>

<p>Then, at what he judged to be a propitious moment, he threw the
door open, walked quickly down the garden path and laid Madam
Rousselin on the turf at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>At once, all about him there rose an outcry. The Corbus rushed
forward along with Leonard, all four of them, spurred to a conflict
by an unreasoning impulse. But what could they do? A carriage was
coming along the road from the right, another from the left. To
attack Ralph in the presence of all these witnesses and recover the
unfortunate woman by force was to betray themselves and bring upon
themselves the inevitable enquiry and the penalty of the law. They
stopped short, exactly as Ralph had foreseen.</p>

<p>In the calmest manner in the world he called to two nuns,
wearing large caps, one of whom was driving a little wagonette
drawn by an old horse, and asked them to succor a poor woman whom
he had found unconscious by the side of the road, her fingers
crushed by some carriage.</p>

<p>The good sisters who were in charge of a refuge and small
infirmary at Duclair were only too ready to do so. They installed
Madam Rousselin in the wagonette and covered her with shawls. She
had not recovered consciousness and was delirious, waving her
mutilated hand, the thumb and first finger of which were swollen
and bleeding.</p>

<p>The horse trotted quietly off.</p>

<p><br>
Ralph remained motionless, thoroughly upset by the sight of that
mutilated hand; and so upset was he that he did not notice the
movements of Leonard and the three Corbus who had surrounded him
and were about to attack him. When he did perceive them, the four
of them had cut him off from the road and were trying to force him
into the garden. No peasant was in sight; and the situation seemed
so favorable to Leonard that he drew his knife.</p>

<p>"Put that up and leave us!" cried Josephine. "You Corbus too.
None of that foolishness!"</p>

<p>She had not risen from her chair while all this had been going
on, but now she rose among the bushes.</p>

<p>Leonard protested: "It isn't foolishness! The foolishness would
be to let him go&mdash;now that we've once got him."</p>

<p>"Be off!" she commanded.</p>

<p>"But that woman&mdash;that woman will denounce us!"</p>

<p>"No she won't. It's not to Mother Rousselin's interest to speak.
Now be off!" said Josephine.</p>

<p>Leonard and his friends moved away. She came close up to
Ralph.</p>

<p>He looked at her at length, with a look which appeared to
disquiet her to the point that to break the silence she had to say
jestingly: "Each in turn, isn't it, Ralph? Between you and me
success passes from one to the other. Today you have the upper
hand. Tomorrow&mdash;but what's the matter with you? You do look
funny! And your eyes are positively savage."</p>

<p>He said curtly: "Goodbye, Josine."</p>

<p>The color in her cheeks faded a little and she said: "Goodbye?
You mean au revoir."</p>

<p>"No: goodbye."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;you mean that you don't wish to see me
again?"</p>

<p>"I don't wish to see you again," he said coldly.</p>

<p>She lowered her eyes. Her eyelids quivered. Her lips were
smiling and at the same time infinitely dolorous.</p>

<p>"Why, Ralph?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"Because I've seen a thing that I cannot&mdash;that I can never
forgive you," he said.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That poor woman's hand."</p>

<p>She looked as if she were going to faint and murmured, "Ah, I
understand...Leonard hurt her. But I forbade him to do anything of
the kind...I thought she had yielded merely to threats."</p>

<p>"You lie, Josine! You heard the woman's cries, just as you heard
them in Maulevrier Forest. Leonard acts, but the will to evil, the
intention to murder is yours, Josine. It was you who sent your
accomplice to the little house in Montmartre with instructions to
kill Bridget Rousselin if she resisted. It was you who some time
ago put the poisonous cachet among those which Beaumagnan would
swallow. It was you who, during the years before that, destroyed
Beaumagnan's two friends, Denis Saint-Hébert and George
d'Isneauval."</p>

<p>"No, no! I won't let you say so!" she broke out. "It isn't true!
And you know it isn't!"</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and said slowly: "Yes: the legend of
the other woman created to meet the necessity of the case...another
woman who is your exact image and commits the crimes, while you,
Josephine Balsamo, content yourself with less brutal adventures. I
believe in that legend. I let myself get muddled up in all these
stories of identical women, daughter, granddaughter, and great
granddaughter of Cagliostro. But it's all over, Josine. If my eyes
deliberately closed themselves formerly in order not to see things,
the sight of that mangled hand has definitely opened them to the
truth."</p>

<p>"You are acting on lies, Ralph! On wrong interpretations! I
never knew the two men of whom you speak!"</p>

<p>He said wearily: "It may be so. It is not altogether impossible
that I am making a mistake. But it is altogether impossible that I
should henceforward see you through this fog of mystery in which
you've hidden yourself. You are no longer mysterious to me, Josine.
I see you as you are&mdash;that is to say as a criminal."</p>

<p>He paused and added in a lower voice: "As a sick woman even. If
there is a lie anywhere, it's the lie of your beauty."</p>

<p>She was silent. In the shadow of her straw hat her face was
still sweet. The accusations of her lover did not ruffle her. She
was altogether seductive, altogether enchanting.</p>

<p>He was disturbed to the very depths of his being. Never had she
appeared to him so beautiful and so desirable; and he asked himself
if it were not folly to seize a freedom which he would curse on the
morrow.</p>

<p>"My beauty is not a lie, Ralph," she declared. "And will come
back to me because it is for you that I am beautiful."</p>

<p>"I shall never come back."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can no longer live without me. The <i>Nonchalante</i>
is close by, I shall be waiting for you tomorrow."</p>

<p>"I shall never come back," said he, once more ready to bend the
knee.</p>

<p>"In that case, why are you trembling? Why are you so pale?" she
said stretching out her arms toward him.</p>

<p>He perceived that his salvation depended on his silence, that he
must flee without answering, and never turn his head.</p>

<p>He thrust off the two hands which were grasping him, and
went.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>11. The Old Lighthouse</h2>

<p>All that night, Ralph pedaled away, as much to wear himself out
with a salutary weariness as to throw the gang off his track. Next
morning, utterly worn out he came to a stop at an hotel at
Lillebonne.</p>

<p>He forbade them to awake him, locked and bolted his door, and
slept for twenty-four hours. When he had dressed and breakfasted,
all he thought of was mounting his bicycle and returning to the
<i>Nonchalante</i>. The struggle against love had begun.</p>

<p>He was very unhappy, and having never suffered, having always
followed his whims, he raged against a despair to which it would
have been so easy for him to put an end.</p>

<p>"Why not yield?" he said to himself. "I can get there in two
hours. And what is there to prevent me going off again a few days
later when I shall have hardened myself against the parting?"</p>

<p>But he could not do so. The vision of that mutilated hand was a
veritable obsession and ruled his actions. It obliged him to recall
those other barbarous and hateful deeds which enabled him to see
this one as their natural sequel.</p>

<p>Josephine had done this; then Josephine had murdered; Josephine
did not shrink from murderous acts and found it quite simple and
natural to kill and kill again when murder helped her enterprises.
From murder Ralph shrank, with a physical repulsion, a revolt of
every instinct. The idea that he might be drawn, in some access of
madness, to shed blood, filled him with horror. And with this
horror the most tragic of realities associated indissolubly the
image of the woman he loved.</p>

<p>He stayed away, but at the cost of what efforts! In what groans
did his impotent revolt die away! Josephine stretched out her
lovely arms to him and offered her mouth to his kisses. How resist
the appeal of that voluptuous creature?</p>

<p>Moved to the lowest depths of his egotism, for the first time he
became aware of the immense suffering he must have inflicted on
Clarice d'Etigues. Now he could imagine her tears, the overwhelming
distress of her shattered life. Shaken by remorse, he addressed to
her discourses full of tenderness in which he recalled the moving
hours of their love.</p>

<p>He did more. Knowing that the young girl received her letters
direct, he dared to write to her:</p>

<p class="letter">Forgive me, dear Clarice. I have treated you like
a scoundrel. Let us hope for a brighter future and think of me with
all the indulgence of your generous heart. Once more, forgive
me&mdash;forgive.<br>
Ralph.</p>

<p>"If only I were with her, how quickly I should forget all these
horrible things!" he said to himself. "The essential thing is not
to have innocent eyes and kissable lips but a loyal and serious
spirit like that of Clarice."</p>

<p>Only it was the eyes and the ambiguous smile of Josephine that
he adored; and when he thought of her caresses, it was little he
cared that she had a spirit which was neither loyal nor
innocent.</p>

<p>In the meantime he set about hunting for the old lighthouse of
which Madam Rousselin had spoken. Since he knew that she lived at
Lillebonne he had no doubt that that lighthouse was in the
neighborhood of it and that was the reason he had gone in the
direction he did when he left Josephine.</p>

<p>He was not mistaken. He had only to make enquiries to learn,
firstly, that there was an old, abandoned lighthouse in the woods
which surrounded the Château de Tancarville, and secondly that the
owner of that lighthouse had entrusted the keys of it to the Widow
Rousselin, who, on the Tuesday of every week, went to clean it. A
simple nocturnal expedition put him in possession of those
keys.</p>

<p>It was only two days from the day on which the unknown person
who possessed the casket was certainly going to meet the Widow
Rousselin; and since she, a prisoner or an invalid, had not been
able to put off the engagement, everything was arranged in a manner
that would enable him to profit by an interview which he reckoned
so important. This prospect soothed him. The problem which had been
worrying him for weeks and of which the solution seemed to have
become a matter of days, again took possesion of his mind.</p>

<p>To leave nothing to chance, on the Monday evening he paid a
visit to the meeting-place, and on the Tuesday, when, an hour
before the meeting he briskly traversed the woods of Tancarville
success appeared to him inevitable; and he was brimming with pride
and pleasure.</p>

<p>Part of these woods, beyond the park, stretches as far as the
Seine and covers the cliffs. The roads run through it from central
crossroads, and one of them leads through ravines and over steep
ridges towards the rugged promontory, on which rises, half visible,
the abandoned lighthouse. During the week the spot is absolutely
deserted. Sometimes on a Sunday picnickers take possession of
it.</p>

<p>If you ascend to the top of it, you get a glorious view over the
Tancarville canal and the river estuary. But the bottom of it was
at that time buried in brush wood. On the ground floor is a single
room, of a fair size, pierced by two windows, and furnished with
two chairs. It opens on the land side on an enclosure full of
nettles and weeds.</p>

<p>As he drew near it Ralph's pace slackened. He had a very natural
impression that important events were about to happen and that they
were not only thus meeting with an unknown and the definite
conquest of a formidable secret, but that they were a continuation
of the supreme battle in which the enemy would be definitely
defeated.</p>

<p>And this enemy was the Countess of Cagliostro&mdash;the Countess
who knew as well as he the admissions torn from the Widow
Rousselin, and who, incapable of accepting defeat and disposing of
unlimited means of investigation, must have easily found this old
lighthouse, in which the last act of the drama was about to be
played.</p>

<p>"And not only," said he under his breath, laughing at himself,
"do I ask whether she will come to the meeting-place, but in
reality I hope keenly that she will be there and that I shall see
her again and that, both of us victors, we shall fall into one
another's arms."</p>

<p>Through a gate in the little wall, the top of which was
bristling with broken bottles, he went into the enclosure. There
was no trace of anyone's passage through the weeds; but it was
possible to cross the wall in another place and to climb in through
one of the windows at the side.</p>

<p>His heart was beating. His fists were clenched. He was ready for
the struggle, if a trap had been laid for him.</p>

<p>"But how silly I am!" he thought. "Why a trap?"</p>

<p>He turned the handle of the worm-eaten door and entered.</p>

<p>On the instant he felt that someone was in hiding in the recess
beside the door. He had no time to turn upon the assailant.
Scarcely did he become aware of him, by instinct rather than by
actual vision than a noose that dragged him backwards tightened
round his neck and a knee came with brutal violence against the
small of his back. Suffocated and jolted, he was at the mercy of
his opponent and came heavily to the ground.</p>

<p>"A good stroke, Leonard!" he muttered. "A pretty revenge!"</p>

<p>He was wrong. It was not Leonard. He caught sight of his
assailant's profile and recognized Beaumagnan. Then while
Beaumagnan was tying his hands, he rectified his error and admitted
his surprise in the simple words:</p>

<p>"So&mdash;so&mdash;the candidate for the priesthood!"</p>

<p><br>
The rope which encircled his neck had been run through a ring in
the opposite wall just above one of the windows. Beaumagnan who was
acting with jerky movements and apparently half mad, opened that
window and half opened the shutter that opened out wards. Then,
using the ring as a pulley-block, he pulled the rope and compelled
Ralph to walk across the room. Ralph saw through the half-opened
shutters the empty space, which, from the top of the steep slope on
which the lighthouse had been built, fell among sloping boulders
and great trunks of trees whose leafy tops shut out the
horizon.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan twisted him round, set his back against the shutters,
and tied him to them by the wrists and ankles. Ralph was now in
this predicament: in the case of his trying to move forward, the
rope round his neck, tightening through the slipknot would strangle
him; if on the other hand the whim took Beaumagnan to get rid of
his victim, he had only to give him a sharp push, the shutters
would give way and Ralph, dangling over the abyss, would find
himself being hanged.</p>

<p>"An excellent position for a serious conversation," he
sneered.</p>

<p>Moreover his mind was made up. If it was Beaumagnan's intention
to give him the choice between death and divulging the steps that
he, Ralph, had been able to make towards a solution of the problem,
he would speak without the slightest hesitation.</p>

<p>"I'm at your orders," he said. "Ask away."</p>

<p>"Be quiet!" snapped Beaumagnan, in raging accents. He stuck a
pad of cotton wool over Ralph's mouth and fastened it in place by a
handerchief tied round his head.</p>

<p>"A single sound&mdash;a single movement&mdash;and with one blow
of my fist I'll knock you into the abyss!" he snarled.</p>

<p>He looked at him for a moment as if he were asking himself
whether he had not better do it at once and be done with it.</p>

<p>But of a sudden he left him, crossed the room on tiptoe and
stretching himself at full length on the threshold, looked through
the door which was a little way open.</p>

<p>"Things are going badly," thought Ralph, uncommonly anxious.
"They are going all the more badly because I don't understand at
all what is really happening. How comes he to be here? Am I to
suppose that he is the benefactor of the Widow Rousselin, that
benefactor whom she did not wish to compromise?"</p>

<p>That hypothesis did not satisfy him.</p>

<p>"No: that isn't it. I have fallen into a trap not because it was
set for me but because I was foolishly careless. It's plain that a
beggar like Beaumagnan knows the whole Rousselin business, that he
has learned of these meetings and the hour of these meetings; and
then, knowing that the widow has been abducted, he watches and
makes other people watch the neighborhood of Lillebonne and
Tancarville. So it came about that they have discovered that I was
on the spot and my goings and comings&mdash;and then the
trap&mdash;and then&mdash;"</p>

<p>This time Ralph's conviction was profound, the conqueror of
Beaumagnan at Paris, he had just lost the second engagement.
Victorious in his turn, Beaumagnan had spread him out on a shutter
like a bat nailed to a wall and was now looking out for the other
person in order to seize him and tear the secret from him.</p>

<p>One point however remained obscure. Why this attitude of a wild
beast ready to spring upon its prey? That was quite out of keeping
with the probably quite peaceful meeting which was to take place
between him and that unknown person. Beaumagnan had only to go out
and wait for him outside and say:</p>

<p>"Madam Rousselin is ill and has sent me in her place. She would
like to know the inscription engraved on the lid of the
casket."</p>

<p>"Always supposing," thought Ralph, "that Beaumagnan hasn't
reason to expect some other person to come&mdash;and that he does
not distrust that person...and that he is not preparing for another
attack."</p>

<p>It was sufficient for such a question to present itself to Ralph
for him to perceive at once the exact solution. To suppose that
Beaumagnan had laid a trap for him, Ralph, was only half the truth.
The ambush was a double one. Who then could Beaumagnan be looking
for in this fever of exasperation if not for Josephine Balsamo?</p>

<p>"That's it! That's it!" said Ralph to himself, the facts of the
matter at last clear to him. "He has guessed that she is alive.
Yes, the other day in Paris when we had that tussle he must have
guessed this amazing fact. And that's another blunder I've
made...for lack of experience. Should I have spoken like that and
acted like that if Josephine Balsamo were not alive? What? I told
this man I had read between the lines of his letter to Baron
Godfrey, that I was present at the famous gathering at La Haie
d'Etigues, and yet failed to understand what he really had in store
for the Countess of Cagliostro! And was it likely that a young
fellow like me, so thoroughly alive, would abandon that charming
woman? Come then: if I was at the trial I was certainly at the
priest's staircase. I was certainly present at the embarkation. I
certainly rescued Josephine. And we loved one another not with a
love which dated from last winter, as I pretended, but with a love
posterior to Josephine's supposed death!...That is what Beaumagnan
said to himself."</p>

<p>Proof piled on proof. Events linked themselves together like the
links of a chain. Entangled in the Rousselin affair and
consequently sought for by Beaumagnan, Josephine had not failed to
search the neighborhood of the lighthouse. Informed of this at
once, Beaumagnan formed his ambuscade. Ralph had fallen into it; it
was now the turn of Josephine!</p>

<p>One would have said that Fate wished to confirm immediately the
ideas which had been running through Ralph's mind. He had scarcely
reached this conclusion when there came the sound of a carriage
coming up the road which runs along the canal under the cliff. On
the instant, Ralph recognized the quick trot of Leonard's
horses.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan, on his part, must have known what was happening, for
he sprang up and listened.</p>

<p>The noise of hoofs ceased, then began again slower. The carriage
was mounting the rocky lane, which winds up towards the plateau and
from which runs the forest path, in which there is no room for a
carriage, which ascends the steep slope to the old lighthouse.</p>

<p>In five minutes or less, Josephine would appear.</p>

<p>Every second of every one of those solemn minutes increased the
agitation and frenzy of Beaumagnan. He muttered incoherent words.
His mask of romantic actor grew uglier and uglier till his face
became of a purely bestial hideousness. The instinct, the will to
murder contorted his features; and all at once it became clear that
this will, this savage instinct were inflamed against Ralph,
against Josephine's lover.</p>

<p>Once more his feet began to pace mechanically the tiled floor.
He was walking up and down without knowing it; he was going to kill
without knowing it, like a drunken man. His arms outstretched
themselves. His clenched fists moved forward like two battering
rams that a slow, continuous, and irresistible force would have
thrust against the young man's bosom. A few more steps, and Ralph
would be dangling in the abyss. He shut his eyes. However, he was
not in the slightest degree resigned and tried hard to retain a
vestige of hope.</p>

<p>"The rope will break," he thought, "and there will be thick
grass for me to fall on. Truly it is not the fate of Monsieur
Arsène Lupin d'Andresy to be hung. If, at my age, I have no chance
of getting out of such a hole as this, it must be that the gods
have no intention of taking a real interest in me. In that case
there is nothing to regret."</p>

<p>He thought of his father and of the instruction in gymnastics he
had had from Theophrastus Lupin. He murmured the name of
Clarice.</p>

<p>However, the blow did not come. Even as he felt him within
striking distance, it seemed that his adversary stopped in his
spring.</p>

<p>He opened his eyes. Beaumagnan, drawn up to his full height, was
towering above him. But he did not move; his arms had fallen; and
on his face, on which the thought of murder had impressed the most
abominable expression, the decision seemed to be suspended.</p>

<p>Ralph listened and heard nothing. But perhaps Beaumagnan, whose
senses had been rendered extraordinarily acute by his emotions,
heard Josephine coming. As a matter of fact, he drew back a step or
two and then with a rush took up his post in the recess to the
right of the door.</p>

<p>Ralph had a good view of his face. It was hideous. He looked for
all the world like a sportsman practising bringing his gun to his
shoulder in order to get the stiffness out of his arms and bring it
up quickly when the time came to shoot. So Beaumagnan's hands were
moving in the gestures necessary to the crime. They kept opening
for the strangling, moved to a suitable distance from one another,
and closed their curved fingers like talons.</p>

<p>Ralph was panic-stricken. His impotence was terrible; it was a
veritable martyrdom.</p>

<p>Though he was well aware that any movement was useless, he
struggled to break his bonds. If only he had been able to call out
to warn her! But the gag smothered his cries and the bonds cut into
his flesh.</p>

<p>Outside the deep silence was broken by the sound of footsteps.
The gate grated on its hinges, a petticoat rustled among the tall
weeds, a foot crunched the pebbles.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan, flattened against the wall, raised his forearms; his
hands, trembling like the hands of a skeleton shaken by the wind,
seemed already to be closing round a neck and to be gripping it,
all alive and throbbing.</p>

<p>Ralph moaned behind his gag.</p>

<p>And then the door opened and the scene was played.</p>

<p>It was played exactly in the manner in which Beaumagnan had
planned and Ralph pictured to himself. The figure of Josephine
Balsamo stepped over the threshold and on the instant was crushed
down in Beaumagnan's rush. A feeble moan from her was drowned by a
kind of furious baying which poured from the assassin's throat.</p>

<p>Ralph groaned. Never had he loved Josephine so dearly as at the
moment in which he saw her in her death agony. Her faults? Her
crimes? What did they matter? She was the most beautiful creature
in the world and all that beauty, that adorable smile, that
charming body, made for all the caresses, were about to be
annihilated. No help was possible. No force could avail against the
irresistible strength of this brute.</p>

<p>What saved Josephine was the excess of Beaumagnan's love which
death alone could glut. At the last moment it was unable to
complete its sinister task. At the end of his strength, racked by a
despair which suddenly assumed the appearance of madness,
Beaumagnan rolled on the ground tearing at his hair and banging his
head on the tiles.</p>

<p>Ralph breathed again. Though appearances were against it and
though Josephine did not move, he was sure she was not dead. As a
matter of fact, slowly, coming out of the horrible nightmare, she
raised herself, and after several violent fits of shuddering, at
last stood upright, her usual well-balanced and calm self. She was
dressed in a cloak with a cape to it and was wearing a toque from
which hung a veil embroidered with large flowers. She let the cloak
fall, revealing her bare shoulders, for her bodice had been torn in
the struggle. As for the toque and veil, which had been badly
rumpled, she threw them into a corner and her hair, freed from
them, fell on each side of her forehead in heavy, even curls full
of tawny lights. Her cheeks had more color in them than usual and
her eyes were shining more brightly.</p>

<p>A long moment of silence followed. The two men gazed at her with
distracted eyes, no longer as if she were an enemy, or sweetheart,
or a victim, but simply as a radiant woman whose enchanting
fascination charmed them. Ralph deeply moved, Beaumagnan motionless
and prone, both of them admired her with the same fervor.</p>

<p>She raised to her lips a little metal whistle that Ralph knew
well. Leonard must be on guard a little way off and would at once
hurry to its call. But she changed her mind. Why call him when she
remained the absolute mistress of the situation?</p>

<p>She went to Ralph, unknotted the handkerchief which kept the gag
in its place, and said: "You did not come back, Ralph, as I thought
you would. But you will come back, won't you?"</p>

<p>If he had been free, he would have clasped her to him furiously.
But why did she not cut through his bonds? What secret design
prevented that?</p>

<p>He said firmly: "No. It's all over."</p>

<p>She raised herself on to the top of her toes and glued her lips
to his, murmuring: "All over&mdash;between us? You're mad,
Ralph!"</p>

<p>Beaumagnan sprang to his feet and, beside himself at the sight
of this unexpected caress, advanced on her. But, as he stretched
out his hand to seize her arm, she turned on him; and suddenly the
coolness she had maintained up to that moment gave place to the
real feelings which filled her, the feelings of execration and
furious rancor with which he inspired her.</p>

<p>She broke out with a violence of which Ralph had not believed
her capable: "Don't touch me, you wretch! And don't suppose that
I'm afraid of you. Today you're alone. And I saw quite clearly just
now that you would never dare murder me. Your hands were trembling.
My hands will not tremble, Beaumagnan, when your hour comes."</p>

<p>He recoiled before her imprecations and her threats; and she
went on, in a fresh access of hate: "But your hour has not yet
come. You have not suffered enough. You did not suffer because you
believed me dead. Your punishment now shall be to know that I am
alive and that I love! Yes; understand that: I love Ralph. I loved
him first in order to avenge myself on you and tell you of it
later. And I love him today for no reason at all, just because he
is himself and I can no longer forget him. He hardly knew it; I
hardly knew it myself. But for some days, ever since he fled from
me, I have felt that he is my whole life. I did not know what love
was; and that is what love is: it's this madness which burns
me."</p>

<p>She was a prey to delirium just as the man she was torturing.
Her amorous cries seemed to hurt her as much as they hurt
Beaumagnan. But to see her like that filled Ralph rather with
distaste than with joy. The flame of passion and admiration and
love, which had flared up in him in the hour of her peril, died
down for good and all. Her beauty and charm vanished like a mirage;
and on her face, which never the less had in no way changed, he saw
the ugly reflection of a cruel and diseased spirit.</p>

<p>She continued her furious onslaught on Beaumagnan, who stood
jerking with jealous fury. And it was really uncommonly
disconcerting to see these two creatures, who, at the very moment
at which circumstances were about to furnish them with the keyword
of the enigma which had puzzled them so long, forget everything in
the outburst of their passion. The great secret of past ages, the
discovery of the jewels, the legendary block of granite, the
casket, the inscription, the Widow Rousselin, and the person
actually on the way to reveal the truth to them&mdash;these were so
many old wives' tales in which neither of them no took any
interest. Love, like a furious torrent, swept everything away.
Hatred and passion had plunged into the eternal conflict which
tears the hearts of lovers.</p>

<p>Once more the fingers of Beaumagnan were curved like talons and
his trembling hands were outstretched to strangle her. But she
raged at him, blind and beside herself, and flung in his face the
insult of her love.</p>

<p>"I love him, Beaumagnan!" she cried. "The fire which burns you
and devours me, too, is a love like your love; with it is mingled
the idea of death and murder. Yes, I would rather kill him than
know that he was another's, or than know that he loves me no
longer. But he does love me, Beaumagnan! He loves me! He loves
me!"</p>

<p>An unexpected laugh burst from Beaumagnan's convulsed lips; his
fury ended in a fit of sardonic hilarity.</p>

<p>"He loves you, Josephine? You're right: he loves you! He loves
you as he loves all women. You're beautiful and he desires you.
Another passes and he desires her, too. And you suffer as I do the
tortures of hell. Confess it!"</p>

<p>"The tortures of hell, yes," she said, "the tortures of hell if
I believe in his falseness. But it isn't so; and you're trying
stupidly to&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped short. Beaumagnan was chuckling with such a
malicious joy that she was afraid.</p>

<p>In a low voice and in a tone of sudden pain she said: "A proof!
Give me a single proof...Not even a proof...A mere
indication...Something that compels me to doubt...And I'll kill him
like a dog!"</p>

<p>She drew from her bodice a small life-preserver, a ball of lead
with a whalebone handle. Her eyes grew hard.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan answered: "What I bring you will not make you doubt;
it will give you certainty."</p>

<p>"Speak...Give me a name."</p>

<p>"Clarice d'Etigues," he said.</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and said confidently: "I know all
about that; a flirtation of no importance."</p>

<p>"It was important enough to him since he asked her father's
permission to marry her," sneered Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"He asked what? But it's nonsense! It's impossible! I got to
know all about it. They met one another two or three times in the
country&mdash;not more."</p>

<p>"Better than that, they met in the young woman's set of rooms in
the Château."</p>

<p>"You lie!" she cried.</p>

<p>"What you must mean is that her father is lying, for these facts
were confided to me by Godfrey d'Etigues the night before last," he
said in a tone of sinister triumph.</p>

<p>"And who did he get them from?"</p>

<p>"From Clarice herself."</p>

<p>"But it's absurd! A girl never admits a thing like that!"</p>

<p>"I tell you he got it out of her the day before yesterday."</p>

<p>"But what put him on to it? They have never seen one another
again," she said.</p>

<p>"They write to one another."</p>

<p>"A proof, Beaumagnan! Give me a proof this instant!" she cried
with a sudden fury.</p>

<p>"Will a letter satisfy you?"</p>

<p>"A letter?"</p>

<p>"Written by him to Clarice," said Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"Written four months ago?"</p>

<p>"Written four days ago."</p>

<p>She clutched at her bosom and paled and said between her teeth:
"Have you got it?"</p>

<p>"Here it is."</p>

<p>Ralph, who had listened to the last dozen sentences with extreme
discomfort, trembled. He recognized the letter which he had sent
from Lillebonne to Clarice d'Etigues.</p>

<p>Josephine took it from Beaumagnan and read it in a low voice,
giving every syllable its full value:</p>

<p class="letter">Forgive me, dear Clarice. I have treated you like
a scoundrel. Let us hope for a brighter future and think of me with
all the indulgence of your generous heart. Once more, forgive
me&mdash;forgive. Ralph.</p>

<p>She hardly had the strength to finish the reading of this
letter, which denied her and wounded her vanity in the cruelest
fashion. She tottered. Her eyes sought those of Ralph. He
understood that Clarice was condemned to death and in his heart of
hearts he knew that never again would he feel anything but hate for
Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan said quietly, in explanation: "Godfrey intercepted
this letter and sent it to me, asking my advice. The postmark on
the envelope was Lillebonne; that's how I got on the track of both
of you again."</p>

<p>Josephine said nothing. Her face displayed so profound a
suffering that it might have touched one. The tears which rolled
slowly down her cheeks might have awakened one's pity, if her grief
had not so plainly been dominated by a bitter lust for vengeance.
She was making her plans, devising the snare.</p>

<p>Shaking her head, she said to Ralph: "I warned you, Ralph."</p>

<p>"A man who is warned is worth two," he said in a joking
tone.</p>

<p>"Don't make a joke of it!" she cried with savage impatience.
"You know what I told you, that you had better be careful never to
let her cross the path of our love."</p>

<p>"And you know what I told you," Ralph retorted with the same
irritating air. "If ever you touch a single hair of her
head&mdash;"</p>

<p>She trembled and said bitterly: "How can you laugh at my
suffering like this? How can you take the part of another woman
against me?...Against me!" Then she added in quieter, threatening
accents: "All the worse for her."</p>

<p>"Don't worry about her," he said. "She's safe enough, since I'll
protect her."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan watched them with a gloomy joy; their discord and all
this hate that welled up in them warmed his heart. But Josephine
recovered control of herself, reckoning, doubtless, that it was a
waste of words to speak of a vengeance which would be hers in due
time. At the moment other cares thrust this one from her mind, for,
a little way off, someone blew a whistle gently.</p>

<p>The grief and fury vanished from her face and she said: "Did you
hear that whistle, Beaumagnan? It's one of my men who are watching
the path to the lighthouse. The person for whom we are waiting must
be in sight, for I suppose that that's what you are here for,
too?"</p>

<p>Indeed, the presence of Beaumagnan at that place at that hour
needed to be accounted for. How had he known of the meeting and the
meeting-place? What special information had he with regard to the
Rousselin business?</p>

<p>She cast a glance at Ralph. He, at any rate, bound hand and
foot, could not hamper her plans or take part in the final battle.
But Beaumagnan appeared to trouble her; and she went towards the
door as if she wished to be the first to meet the person they
expected, when, at the very instant at which she was going to it,
quick footsteps were heard. She stepped backwards, therefore, with
a movement that thrust Beaumagnan aside and cleared the door for
the entrance of Leonard. He looked sharply from one to the other of
the two men, then drew Josephine aside, and whispered in her
ear.</p>

<p>She seemed astounded and murmured: "What do you mean? What on
earth <i>do</i> you mean?"</p>

<p>She turned her head that they might not see her expression; but
Ralph had an impression that it was one of extreme joy.</p>

<p>"Don't stir," she said. "The owner of the casket is here. Out
with your revolver, Leonard. Be ready to shoot."</p>

<p>She turned on Beaumagnan, who was trying to open the door, and
cried: "You must be mad! Stay where you are!"</p>

<p>But when he insisted she lost her temper and said: "What do you
want to go out for? What are you up to? You must know this person
and want to balk us and get away with the casket. Is that your
game? Speak up!"</p>

<p>Beaumagnan did not loose the handle of the door. Josephine
gripped his arm with her right hand and tried to hold him back.
Perceiving that she would not succeed, she turned towards Leonard,
and with her left hand pointed to Beaumagnan's left shoulder with a
gesture which bade her henchman strike and strike quietly. In about
a second he had drawn a dagger from his pocket and driven it into
their enemy's left shoulder.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan groaned and cried: "The damned jade!" and dropped
fainting to the floor.</p>

<p>She said calmly to Leonard: "Help me; and be quick about
it."</p>

<p>The two of them dragged Beaumagnan into the recess. Leonard cut
off the end of the rope which was round Ralph's neck, and the two
of them bound together the wounded man's wrists and ankles. Then
she looked at his shoulder and said: "That's nothing&mdash;two or
three days in bed and he'll be all right again. Come on."</p>

<p>They went back to the door.</p>

<p>She had performed these actions quietly, without the slightest
haste and, from the expression on her face, she might have been
doing the most ordinary things in the world. Every gesture was
quiet and easy; she gave her orders with no vestige of excitement.
But there was a note of triumph in her voice that inspired Ralph
with a growing uneasiness, and he was on the point of shouting to
warn the person who, in his or her turn, was walking into the
trap.</p>

<p>But what was the use? The measures of Josephine had been taken
too carefully for his cry of warning to upset them. Besides he did
not quite know what to do. All kinds of absurd notions were running
through his mind. And then&mdash;then it was too late. A groan
burst from his lips.</p>

<p>Clarice d'Etigues came through the door!</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>12. Madness and Genius</h2>

<p>Up to that moment Ralph had been feeling but a moderate
apprehension. The danger only threatened him and Josephine. For his
part, he trusted to his cleverness and lucky star; and as for
Josephine, he knew that she was quite capable of defending herself
against Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>But Clarice! Confronted by Josephine Balsamo, Clarice was a mere
victim at the mercy of the treachery and cruelty of an enemy. And
from that moment his fear was mingled with a kind of physical
horror, which actually made his hair stand upright on his head and
gave him what is vulgarly called gooseflesh. The implacable face of
Leonard also added to his fear. He remembered the Widow Rousselin
and her crushed fingers.</p>

<p>Truly he had seen clearly ahead when, coming to the
meeting-place an hour before, he guessed that the great battle was
before him and that he would come to grips with Josephine. Up to
now they had had mere skirmishes, mere affairs of outposts. Now it
was a struggle to the death between all these opposing forces; and
he was confronting them with his hands bound, a rope round his
neck, and this additional enfeeblement with which the coming of
Clarice afflicted him.</p>

<p>"I've a lot to learn yet," he said to himself with a groan. "I'm
chiefly responsible for this horrible situation, and Clarice is
once more my victim."</p>

<p>The young girl stood speechless before the threat of the
revolver which Leonard leveled at her. She had come on light feet,
as one comes to meet someone one is glad to see again, and had
stumbled into the midst of this scene of violence and crime, while
the man she loved stood before her bound and motionless.</p>

<p>She stammered: "What's the matter, Ralph? Why are you tied up
like that?"</p>

<p>She stretched out her hands towards him, as much as to ask his
help as to offer him hers. But what could either of them do? He
noticed her worn features and the extreme lassitude of her bearing;
and he could hardly refrain from tears at the thought of the
painful confession her father had torn from her.</p>

<p>But, in spite of everything, he said with imperturbable
assurance: "I've nothing to be frightened of, Clarice, no more have
you. Absolutely nothing. I answer for everything."</p>

<p>She looked round at the others and was astonished to recognize
Beaumagnan. She said timidly to Leonard: "What is it you want? This
is rather terrifying. Who was it made me come here?"</p>

<p>"I did, Mademoiselle," said Josephine.</p>

<p>Clarice had already been struck by Josephine's beauty. A scrap
of hope came to her at the thought that nothing but help and
protection could come from so beautiful a creature.</p>

<p>"Who are you, Madam? I don't think I know you," she said
timidly.</p>

<p>"I know you," said Josephine, whom the grace and sweetness of
the young girl seemed to irritate, though she kept her anger under
control. "You're the daughter of Baron d'Etigues. I know, too, that
you're in love with Ralph d'Andresy."</p>

<p>Clarice blushed but did not deny it.</p>

<p>Josephine said to Leonard: "Go and shut the gate. Put the chain
and padlock you brought on it, and set up that old notice-board
with 'Private' on it."</p>

<p>"Am I to stay outside?" asked Leonard.</p>

<p>"Yes; I've no need of you at the moment," said Josephine with an
air which terrified Ralph. "Stay outside. And see that no one
interrupts us&mdash;on any account."</p>

<p>Leonard forced Clarice to sit down on one of the chairs and drew
her arms behind her with the intention of tying her wrists to the
back of it.</p>

<p>"There's no need to do that," said Josephine. "Leave us."</p>

<p>He did as she bade him.</p>

<p>She looked from one to another of her three victims in turn. All
three disarmed and reduced to impotence, she was mistress of the
field of battle and on pain of death could impose her inflexible
decrees.</p>

<p>Ralph's eyes never left her; he was trying to discover her
intentions and her plans. Her calmness impressed him more than
anything. She showed none of that excitement and feverishness which
would have, so to speak, disarticulated the conduct of any other
woman in her place. There was not a trace of triumph in her
attitude. There was rather a certain weariness, as if she had acted
under the impulsion of inner forces, which she was not strong
enough to discipline. For the first time he divined in her a
careless fatalism, as a rule concealed by her smiling beauty, which
was perhaps the very essence and explanation of her enigmatic
nature.</p>

<p>She sat down on the other chair close to Clarice, and with her
eyes on her face said slowly, with a certain dryness and monotony
in her intonation: "Three months ago, Mademoiselle, a young woman
was secretly abducted on getting out of a train and transported to
the Château of La Haie d'Etigues, where there were gathered
together, in a large isolated chamber, a dozen of the noblemen of
the Caux country. Among them were Beaumagnan, whom you see here,
and your father. I will not tell you everything which was said at
this meeting and of all the ignominy that was heaped on that young
woman by these people who pretended to be her judges. But it came
about that after a pretense of a trial, that evening, when the rest
of the guests had gone, your father and his cousin de Bennetot
carried her to the bottom of the cliff, tied her down in the bottom
of a boat with a hole in it and heavily loaded with a big boulder,
rowed her out to sea, and there abandoned her."</p>

<p>Breathless with amazement Clarice stammered: "It isn't true! It
isn't true!...My father would never do such a thing!...It isn't
true!"</p>

<p>Without paying any heed to her indignant protest, Josephine
quietly continued: "Without any of the conspirators being aware of
it, there was a spectator at that meeting at the château. That
spectator kept watch on the two murderers&mdash;there's no other
name for them, is there?&mdash;followed them, clung to the scuttled
boat, and when they abandoned it, rescued their victim. From where
did that spectator come? Everything leads us to believe that he
passed the previous night and morning in your room, received by you
not as a fiancé, since your father refused to hear of his marrying
you, but as a lover."</p>

<p>This accusation and this insult struck Clarice like the blows of
a mallet. On the instant she was overwhelmed and incapable of
resisting or even of defending herself. Pale and fainting, she lay
back in her chair and groaned: "But what a thing to say!"</p>

<p>"But you said it yourself&mdash;to your father&mdash;the day
before yesterday," said Josephine coldly. "Is there any need for me
to go into the whole story and tell you what became of your lover?
That very day Ralph d'Andresy abandoned you to follow the woman he
had saved from a terrible death. He devoted himself to her, body
and soul, won her heart, lived her life, and swore to her never to
see you again. He took that oath in the most categorical fashion:
'I did not love her,' he said. 'It was a mere passing flirtation.
It is all over.' Then following a passing misunderstanding between
her and him, this woman discovered that he was writing to you, that
he wrote the letter which I have here, in which he begged you to
forgive him and gave you hopes of the future. You understand now
that I have some right to treat you as an enemy?" She paused and
added gloomily: "As a mortal enemy."</p>

<p>Clarice was silent. Terror took possession of her, and she
considered with an increasing apprehension the gentle and
terrifying countenance of the woman who had taken Ralph from her
and declared herself her enemy.</p>

<p>Trembling with pity and careless of exciting the anger of
Josephine, Ralph said solemnly: "If I have ever sworn a solemn oath
that I am resolved to keep in the face of everything and everyone,
Clarice, it is the oath I have sworn that not a hair of your head
shall be touched. You have nothing to fear. Inside of ten minutes
you shall leave here safe and sound&mdash;ten minutes, not
more."</p>

<p>Josephine did not take up the challenge; she continued quietly:
"That, then, is the position in which we stand to one another,
clearly set forth. Let us get on to the facts; and I'll be quite
brief. Your father, mademoiselle, Beaumagnan and their
confederates, were engaged in a common enterprise; for my part, I
am seeking the same end and Ralph is seeking it with passionate
intensity. From that it comes about that we are waging an unceasing
war against one another. Now, all of us have had relations with a
woman of the name of Rousselin, who possessed an old casket which
we had needed to succeed in that enterprise. She has parted with
that casket to another person. We questioned her in the most
pressing manner without getting from her the name of that person,
who, it appears, had heaped benefits on her and whom she did not
wish to compromise by any indiscreet statement. All that we could
learn was&mdash;it's an old story, of which I propose to give you
main facts, which you will follow with the greatest interest both
from our point of view...and from your own."</p>

<p>Ralph began to discern the course that Josephine was taking and
the end to which she must inevitably come.</p>

<p>It was so frightful that he said angrily: "No, no: not that!
There are things which should never be revealed!"</p>

<p>She did not appear to hear him, and went on inexorably: "This is
the story: Twenty-two years, ago, during the war between France and
Prussia, two men, who were flying from the invaders and escaping
under the guidance of old Rousselin, murdered a servant of the name
of Jaubert in order to steal his horse. With that horse they were
able to escape. Moreover, they carried away with them a casket that
they had also stolen from their victim, which contained jewels of
great value. Later old Rousselin, whom they had compelled to
accompany them and to whom they had given his share of the booty
some worthless rings, came back to his wife at Rouen and almost
immediately died there. To such an extent had this murder and his
involuntary complicity in it depressed him. Thereupon relations
were established between the widow and the murderers, who feared
that she might let the truth slip out; and it came about I take it,
mademoiselle, that you now understand with whom we are
concerned?"</p>

<p>Clarice was listening to this revelation with so painful an air
of terror that Ralph exclaimed: "Silence, Josine! Not a word more!
What you are doing is in the highest degree vile and absurd. What's
the use of it?"</p>

<p>"The use of it?" she said sharply. "The time has come for the
whole truth to be told. You have thrown us, her and me, into
opposition. It is only fair that she and I should be on equal terms
in our suffering."</p>

<p>"You're a perfect savage!" he murmured in a tone of despair.</p>

<p>But Josephine, turning again to Clarice, continued her
explanation coldly: "Your father and his cousin de Bennetot kept an
eye on the Widow Rousselin; and it is quite clear that she removed
to Lillebonne by the instructions of Baron d'Etigues, for it must
have been much easier to keep an eye on her there. Then, as the
years went on, someone was found, more or less in the know, to
carry out this task. This was you, Mademoiselle. The Widow
Rousselin became so fond of you that, as far as she was concerned,
there was no reason to fear any hostile action. For nothing in the
world would she have betrayed the father of the little girl who
from time to time came to play at her house. Evidently these visits
were secret in order that no thread might link the present with the
past, visits for which, sometimes, meetings in the neighborhood of
the town were substituted&mdash;at the old lighthouse or elsewhere.
It was in the course of one of these visits that you saw in her
house at Lillebonne the casket that Ralph and I were seeking; and
the whim took you to take it away with you to La Haie d'Etigues.
When, then, Ralph and I learned from the Widow Rousselin that the
casket was in the possession of a person whose name she would not
give, that this person had heaped benefits on her, and that they
were to meet on a given day at the old lighthouse, we decided at
once that it would be enough for us to come there, instead of the
Widow Rousselin, to discover part of the truth. And as seen as we
saw you appear we became at once convinced that the two murderers
were none else but de Bennetot and the Baron d'Etigues; that is to
say, the two men who, at a later date, tried to murder me."</p>

<p>Clarice was weeping, her slender form shaken by great sobs.
Ralph did not doubt that the crimes of her father were quite
unknown to her, but also he did not doubt that these accusations of
her enemy suddenly showed her in their true aspect a number of
things which up to then had been obscure to her, and compelled her
to consider her father a murderer. How heartrending it must be for
her! Josephine had truly struck home. With what a frightful
knowledge of evil was this executioner torturing her victim! With
what a refinement a thousand times more cruel than the physical
tortures inflicted on the Widow Rousselin by Leonard was Josine
taking vengeance on the innocent Clarice!</p>

<p>"Yes," she went on in somber accents, "a murderer...His wealth,
his château, his horses, all that he has are the fruits of crime.
It is so, isn't it, Beaumagnan? You can also bear witness to this
fact, since by means of it obtained your hold over him. Master of a
secret that you discovered in some way or other&mdash;it does not
matter how&mdash;you made him act exactly as you bade him and
profited by the first crime he had committed and the fact that you
could bring it home to him, to compel him to serve you and to
murder those who were in your way. I know something about that!
What a set of ruffians you are!"</p>

<p>Her eyes sought the eyes of Ralph. He had the impression that
she was trying to excuse her own crimes by bringing to light the
crimes of Beaumagnan and his confederates.</p>

<p>But he said sternly: "And now? Have you finished? Or are you
going on tearing this unfortunate child to pieces? What more do you
want?"</p>

<p>"I want her to speak," said Josephine.</p>

<p>"And if she speaks, will you let her go free?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then question her," he said. "What is it you demand? The
casket, the key-word inscribed on the inside of the lid? Is that
what you want?"</p>

<p>But whether Clarice was willing to answer or not, whether she
knew or did not know the truth she seemed incapable of speaking a
word, or even of understanding the questions put to her.</p>

<p>Ralph pressed her: "Try to get the better of your grief,
Clarice," he said. "It's the last trial; and all will be over.
Answer, I beg you. There is nothing in what you are called on to
tell which can possibly be against your conscience. You have taken
no oath of secrecy. You are betraying no one. In that
case&mdash;"</p>

<p>His gentle, imploring voice was making the young girl feel
easier in mind. He became conscious of it and asked: "What has
become of that casket? Did you take it to La Haie d'Etigues?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured in a tone of exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It took my fancy&mdash;it was just a whim."</p>

<p>"Did your father see it?" he said quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"The same day?"</p>

<p>"No. Some days later."</p>

<p>"Did he take it away from you?" he asked with a note of keener
interest in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What reason did he give for doing so?"</p>

<p>"None at all."</p>

<p>"But you had had time to examine it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you saw an inscription inside the lid, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"In old characters, wasn't it? Roughly carved?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Did you make it out?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Easily?"</p>

<p>"No; but I did make it out."</p>

<p>"And can you remember the inscription?"</p>

<p>She hesitated; then she said doubtfully: "Perhaps...I don't
know...They were Latin words."</p>

<p>"Latin words? Try to remember them."</p>

<p>Clarice hesitated again; then she said: "But ought I to? If it's
such an important secret, ought I to reveal it?"</p>

<p>"You may, Clarice. I assure you you may," he said earnestly.
"You may, because the secret belongs to no one. No one in the world
has any greater claim to know it than your father, or his friends,
or myself. The secret belongs to the person who shall find it out,
to the first passerby who shall be able to profit by it."</p>

<p>She yielded. What Ralph said must be right.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes; no doubt you're right. But I attached so little
importance to that inscription that I can't remember exactly what
it was...It was something to do with a stone and a queen."</p>

<p>"You must recall it, Clarice; you really must," he begged, for a
sudden fresh overclouding of Josephine's face made him again
anxious.</p>

<p>Slowly, her brow knitted in the effort to remember, correcting
herself and contradicting herself, the young girl succeeded in
saying:</p>

<p>"Here it is&mdash;I remember&mdash;this is exactly the sentence
that I made out...five Latin words...in this order:</p>

<p class="cp"><i>"Ad lapidem currebat olim regina."</i>
</p>

<p>She had hardly got the last syllable out when Josephine bent
sharply towards her and cried furiously:

<p>"It's a lie! That
formula&mdash;we've known it for ages! Beaumagnan can bear witness
to that. We knew it, didn't we, Beaumagnan? She's lying, Ralph!
She's lying! The Cardinal mentions those five words in his
memorandum; and he considered them of so little importance and so
firmly refused to attach any meaning to them that I did not even
tell you about them!...<i>In days gone by the queen ran to the
stone</i>. But where is it, that stone? And who was the queen who
ran to it? We've been trying to find out for the last twenty years.
No, no! There's something else!"</p>

<p>Once again that terrible rage filled her, that rage which did
not manifest itself in a raised voice of incoherent words but in an
agitation altogether interior, which one divined from certain
symptoms and above all from the unusual and abnormal cruelty of her
words.</p>

<p>Bending over the young girl she cried: "You lie!...You
lie!...There is one word which sums up the meaning of those
five...What is it?...There's a key-word...A single key-word...What
is it?"</p>

<p>Terrorized, Clarice lost the power of utterance.</p>

<p>"Think, Clarice," Ralph implored her. "Try to remember...Besides
those five words, did you not see something else?"</p>

<p>"I don't know...I don't think so," moaned the young girl.</p>

<p>"Try to remember...You must remember. Your safety depends on
it!" he cried.</p>

<p>But the very tone of his voice and his frightened tenderness for
Clarice exasperated Josephine.</p>

<p>She gripped the young girl's arm and cried: "Speak! If you
don't&mdash;"</p>

<p>Clarice stuttered incoherently. Josephine blew a shrill blast on
her whistle.</p>

<p>Almost on the instant Leonard stood on the threshold of the
door.</p>

<p>Josephine said, in terrible, inexorable accents: "Take her away,
Leonard, and question her!"</p>

<p>Ralph jerked in his bonds and cried furiously: "You coward! You
wretch! What are you going to do? Are you really the lowest of
women? Leonard, if you touch that child, I swear by God that one
day or another&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How frightened you are for her!" snarled Josephine. "How the
idea of her suffering does upset you! You were certainly born to
understand one another, you two...The daughter of a murderer and a
thief! Yes, a thief!" she said, turning to Clarice. "This fine
lover of yours is nothing but a thief! He has always made his
living by theft. As a child, he was a thief! To give you flowers,
to give you that little engagement ring you wear on your finger, he
stole! He's a burglar and a swindler. Why, his very name, that
pretty name of Andresy, was simply a theft. Ralph d'Andresy? I
should think so! Arsène Lupin, that's his real name. Keep him,
Clarice; he will become famous. Oh, I've seen him at work, this
lover of yours! A master! A marvel of cunning! What a pretty couple
you two will make if I don't take a hand in the game! What a child
of destiny yours will be, son of Arsène Lupin, grandson of Baron
Godfrey!"</p>

<p>This idea of their child added flames to her fury. The madness
of evil was unchained.</p>

<p>"Get on, Leonard!" she cried.</p>

<p>"You savage beast!" shouted Ralph, beside himself. "What a
horror! You have indeed torn off the mask! There's no longer any
need for you to act your comedy! That's what you really
are&mdash;an executioner!"</p>

<p>But there was no holding her; she was set in her barbarous
desire to hurt and torture the young girl. With her own hands she
pushed Clarice, whom Leonard was dragging towards the door.</p>

<p>"Coward! Monster!" Ralph yelled. "A hair of her head, look
you&mdash;a single hair! It means death for the two of you! Loose
her, you monsters!"</p>

<p>He strained so violently against his bonds that all the
apparatus devised by Beaumagnan to hold him smashed. The worm-eaten
shutter tore from its hinges and fell in pieces into the room
behind him.</p>

<p>There was a moment of anxiety in the opposing camp.</p>

<p>But the ropes, though loosened, were strong and hampered him
sufficiently to render him helpless. Nevertheless Leonard drew his
revolver and pressed it against Clarice's temple.</p>

<p>"If he makes another step, a single movement, blow her brains
out!" cried Josephine.</p>

<p>Ralph did not stir. He did not doubt that Leonard would carry
out that order and that his slightest gesture meant instant death
to Clarice. Then?...Then must he resign himself to her fate? Were
there no means of saving her?</p>

<p>Josephine gazed somberly at him; then she said: "Come: you
understand the situation and you're going to behave yourself."</p>

<p>"No," he replied, wholly master of himself. "No; but I'm
considering."</p>

<p>"Considering what?" she sneered.</p>

<p>"I promised her that she should go free and that she had nothing
to fear. I mean to keep my promise."</p>

<p>"You're a little late about it, aren't you?" she said and
sneered again.</p>

<p>"No, Josephine: you're going to let her go."</p>

<p>She turned to Leonard and said: "What are you wasting time for?
Be quick about it!"</p>

<p>"Stop!" said Ralph in a tone ringing with such a certainty of
being obeyed that she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Stop and let her go," he repeated. "You hear, Josephine? I wish
you to let her go. It isn't a matter of postponing the infamous
thing you propose to do or of abandoning it. It's a matter of
instantly letting Clarice d'Etigues go and opening that door for
her to go through."</p>

<p>It must be that he was wholly sure of himself and that his will
rested on truly extraordinary grounds for him to formulate it with
so imperious a solemnity. Even Leonard himself was impressed and
stood undecided; while Clarice, who had not grasped the full horror
of their intention, appeared to take comfort.</p>

<p>Josephine, taken aback, murmured: "Words&mdash;just words. Some
fresh ruse&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Facts," he declared, "or rather one fact which dominates
everything and before which you will have to give way."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked Josephine, more and more disturbed.
"What is it you want?"</p>

<p>"I don't <i>want</i>&mdash;I demand."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The immediate liberty of Clarice. The liberty of leaving this
place without either you or Leonard stirring a foot."</p>

<p>She burst out laughing and asked: "Is that all?"</p>

<p>"That's all."</p>

<p>"And in exchange you offer me?"</p>

<p>"The key-word of the enigma!"</p>

<p>She quivered and said: "You know it, then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>The drama had suddenly undergone a complete change. From all the
furious antagonism which flung them into conflict with one another,
from the hatred and fury of love and jealousy, there seemed to come
clear only their anxiety about the great enterprise. The obsession
of vengeance passed into the background of Josephine's mind. The
thousands and thousands of jewels were, as Ralph had willed, once
more gleaming before her eyes.</p>

<p>Beaumagnan raised himself painfully into a sitting posture and
was listening with all his ears.</p>

<p>Leaving Clarice to the care of her confederate, Josine stepped
nearer to Ralph, and said: "Is it sufficient to know the key-word
of the enigma?"</p>

<p>"No," he said with decision. "It is still necessary to interpret
it. The meaning of the formula is hidden behind a veil; and the
first thing to do is to pierce that veil."</p>

<p>"And have you done it?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I already had some ideas about the matter. Just now, all
at once, the truth flashed on me."</p>

<p>She knew that he was not the man to joke at such a juncture.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it," she said, "and Clarice shall go."</p>

<p>"Let her go first and I'll tell you my idea. Of course I won't
reveal it with a rope round my neck and my hands bound, but free
and in no way hampered."</p>

<p>"But it's absurd!" she protested. "You revolutionize the whole
situation. As it is it's absolutely in my power to do what I
like."</p>

<p>"Not now," he declared. "Now you depend on me and it is for me
to dictate the conditions."</p>

<p>She shrugged her shoulders and looked round the room somewhat
helplessly, then she was obliged to say: "Swear to speak the exact
truth. Swear it by the tomb of your mother."</p>

<p>He said calmly: "By the tomb of my mother I swear to you that
twenty minutes after Clarice has crossed this threshold I will show
you the exact place where that block of granite is, that is to say,
the hiding-place of the treasure accumulated by the monks of the
abbeys of France."</p>

<p>She tried to thrust off the incredible fascination that Ralph
was of a sudden exercising over her with this fabulous offer, and
cried in a tone of revolt: "No, no! It's a trap! You know nothing
at all!"</p>

<p>"Not only do I know, but I'm not the only one to know," he
said.</p>

<p>"Who else knows?"</p>

<p>"Beaumagnan and the Baron."</p>

<p>"Impossible!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Think a little," he said quietly. "The day before yesterday
Beaumagnan was at La Haie d'Etigues. Why? Because the Baron had
recovered the casket and they studied the inscription together.
Then, if there are not only the five words mentioned by the
Cardinal, if there is also <i>the</i> word, the magic word which
sums them up and gives the key to the mystery, they have seen it
and they know it."</p>

<p>"What does that matter?" she said, gazing at Beaumagnan. "I hold
him safely enough."</p>

<p>"But you do not hold Godfrey d'Etigues; and perhaps at this very
minute he is on the spot with his cousin, the two of them sent in
advance by Beaumagnan to explore the spot and make preparations for
carrying off the treasure. Do you understand the danger? Do you
understand that the loss of a minute may mean the loss of the
game?"</p>

<p>She held out fiercely, crying: "I win it if Clarice speaks."</p>

<p>"She will not speak&mdash;for the excellent reason that she has
told you all she knows," he said in a tone that carried
conviction.</p>

<p>"Be it so, but then do you speak yourself, since you have been
so foolish as to make this disclosure. Why should I set her free?
Why should I obey you? As long as Clarice is in the hands of
Leonard, I have only to will to drag from you everything you
know."</p>

<p>He shook his head. "No," he said. "That danger is passed; that
storm is at a distance. Perhaps, as a matter of fact, you have only
to will; but equally as a matter of fact, you can no longer will
that. You have no longer the strength to will it."</p>

<p>And it was true; and he was certain of it. Hard, cruel,
"infernal," as Beaumagnan had said, but none the less a woman and
subject to failure of nerve, she committed her evil deeds rather on
impulse than by a deliberate effort of will&mdash;in an access of
madness and hysteria, which was followed by a kind of lassitude, by
enfeeblement as much moral as physical. Ralph was sure that at that
very moment she was suffering from such a reaction.</p>

<p>"Come, Josephine: be consistent," he said. "You have staked your
life on this card, the conquest of boundless riches. Are you going
to throw away the fruit of all your efforts when I offer you those
riches?"</p>

<p>Her resistance was weakening. But she protested: "I don't trust
you."</p>

<p>"That isn't true. You know quite well that I keep my promises.
If you hesitate&mdash;but you do not hesitate. In your heart of
hearts, you have made your decision; and it is the right one."</p>

<p>She remained thoughtful for a moment, then with a gesture which
signified: "After all, I shall lay my hands on the girl again. My
vengeance is only postponed," she said: "By the memory of your
mother?"</p>

<p>"By the memory of my mother, by all that is left me of honesty
and honor, I will throw complete light on the matter."</p>

<p>"So be it," she said. "But you and that girl will not exchange a
single word apart."</p>

<p>"Not a word," he said readily. "Besides, I've nothing to say to
her that anyone may not hear. Set her free&mdash;that's all I
want."</p>

<p>She gave the order: "Loose the girl, Leonard, and take those
ropes off him."</p>

<p>Leonard's face wore an expression of strong disapproval. But he
was too well-disciplined to protest. He left Clarice and cut the
bonds which still crippled Ralph.</p>

<p>Ralph's behavior was not of the most fitting considering the
seriousness of the occasion. He stretched his legs, performed two
or three exercises with his arms, and took several deep
breaths.</p>

<p>"I like this better," he said cheerfully. "I've no vocation for
playing at prisoners. To deliver the good and punish the evil,
that's what really interests me. Tremble, Leonard."</p>

<p>He turned to Clarice and said: "I beg you to forgive me for all
that has happened. It shall never occur again, you may be sure of
it. Henceforth you're under my protection. Do you feel strong
enough to get home?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;yes," she said. "But what about you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, me&mdash;I do not run any risk. Your safety was the
essential thing. But I'm afraid that you won't be able to walk
far."</p>

<p>"I haven't far to walk. Yesterday my father brought me to stay
with one of my friends; and he is to fetch me tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Is it near here?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, say no more about it. Any information you give will be
used against you."</p>

<p>He conducted her to the door and told Leonard to unlock the
padlock and open the gate.</p>

<p>When Leonard had done so, Ralph said to Clarice: "Be prudent,
and fear nothing, absolutely nothing, either on your own account or
on mine. We shall meet again when the right hour strikes; and it
will not be long striking whatever be the obstacles which separate
us now."</p>

<p>He shut the door after her. Clarice was saved.</p>

<p>Then he had the cheek to say: "What an adorable creature!"</p>

<p><br>
In after days, when Arsène Lupin related this incident in his great
struggle with Josephine Balsamo, he could not refrain from
laughing.</p>

<p>"Yes," he would say. "I laugh now as I laughed at the moment;
and I remember that for the first time I executed one of those
little dances which have often served me since to mark most
difficult victories...and that victory was devilishly
difficult.</p>

<p>"In truth I was overjoyed. Clarice free, everything appeared to
me to be accomplished. I lit a cigarette, and as Josephine planted
herself before me to recall our bargain, I had the bad manners to
blow a cloud of smoke right into her face."</p>

<p>"'Bounder!' she muttered.</p>

<p>"The epithet with which I retorted was really disgraceful. My
excuse is that my tone was more roguish than coarse. And
then&mdash;and then&mdash;have I any need of excuses? Have I any
need to analyze the violent and contradictory feelings with which
that woman inspired me? I do not pride myself on my psychology
where she was concerned, or of having behaved like a gentleman to
her. I loved her and at the same time detested her furiously. And
after her attack on Clarice my disgust and contempt had become
boundless. I no longer saw even the admirable mask of her beauty,
but only that which lay beneath it; and it was a kind of
carnivorous beast which suddenly appeared to me as I flung that
abominable insult at her in the middle of my pirouette."</p>

<p><br>
Arsène Lupin could laugh <i>afterwards</i>. Nevertheless it was a
dangerous moment, and there is no doubt that for two pins either
Josephine or Leonard would have blown his brains out.</p>

<p>She muttered through her closed teeth: "Oh, how I do hate
you!"</p>

<p>"Not more than I hate you," he sneered.</p>

<p>"Bear in mind that Josephine Balsamo has not quite finished with
that Clarice of yours," she retorted in a tone of sinister
threatening.</p>

<p>"Nor has Ralph d'Andresy finished with her," he said
quickly.</p>

<p>"Scoundrel!" she muttered. "You deserve&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A bullet through my head," he said, laughing. "It's out of the
question."</p>

<p>"Don't you defy me too far, Ralph!"</p>

<p>"It's out of the question, I tell you," he repeated. "I am
literally sacred. I am the gentleman who stands for a thousand
millions. Destroy me and the thousand millions slip through your
fingers, O daughter of Cagliostro! Every cell in my brain
corresponds to a precious stone. A little bullet hole in it and you
will call in vain on the spirit of your father! Not a sou for
little Josine! I repeat, my darling, that I am taboo, as they say
in Polynesia. Taboo from head to foot! Go down on your knees and
kiss my hand. That's the best thing you can possibly do."</p>

<p>He opened the window which looked over the enclosure, took a
deep breath, and said: "This place is perfectly suffocating.
Leonard has a decidedly musty smell. Do you make a point of your
executioner's keeping his hand on that revolver in his pocket?"</p>

<p>She stamped her foot and exclaimed: "Enough of this fooling! You
laid down your conditions; you know mine."</p>

<p>"Your money or your life!"</p>

<p>"Speak, and speak at once!"</p>

<p>"What a hurry you're in!" he said in a mocking voice. "In the
first place I fixed a delay of twenty minutes, to be quite sure
that Clarice should be out of reach of your claws; and it is not
nearly twenty minutes since she went. Besides&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Besides what?"</p>

<p>"Besides, how can you expect me to solve in five seconds the
problem that so many people have been nearly bursting themselves in
their efforts to solve for years and years?"</p>

<p>She was immensely taken aback and cried fiercely: "What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"My meaning is quite simple. I want a little time for
reflection."</p>

<p>"Reflection? What for?"</p>

<p>"To get the solution," he said coolly.</p>

<p>"What? You don't know it?"</p>

<p>"The key-word to the enigma? Of course I don't."</p>

<p>"Then you lied!"</p>

<p>"Don't let's get theatrical, Josephine," he said again in a tone
of mockery.</p>

<p>"You lied, because you swore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"By the tomb of my poor mother," he said, smiling. "And I stick
to it. But you must not get things mixed up. I did not swear that I
knew the truth, I swore that I would tell you the truth."</p>

<p>"To tell it, you must know it."</p>

<p>"To know one must reflect, and you don't give me any time! Let's
have a little silence, please! And first of all, let Leonard loose
the butt of his revolver. It puts me off."</p>

<p>Even more than his jokes, the tone of insolent mockery in which
he uttered them set Josephine's teeth on edge. She felt herself
surpassed, and realizing the danger to her vanity she said:</p>

<p>"Take your time about it. I know you. You will keep your
promise."</p>

<p>"Ah! You're going to try kindness on me! I never could resist
kindness...Boy, writing materials! Fine handmade paper, a pen made
out of a hummingbird's quill, the blood of a full-grown negress,
and a piece of candied peel, as the poet says."</p>

<p>He drew the pencil from his pocketbook and a visiting-card on
which some words were already written in a particular order. He
drew some lines to join these words to one another, then on the
reverse he wrote the Latin formula:</p>

<p><i>"Ad lapidem currebat olim regina."</i>
</p>

<p>"Dog-Latin of the worst," he murmured. "I fancy that if I had
been in the place of those good monks, I should have found better
Latin and got quite as good a result. Nevertheless we must take it
as we find it. So the queen rode at a gallop towards the
block...The queen rode...Look at your watch, Josephine."</p>

<p>He was no longer laughing. For a minute or two perhaps, not
more, his face was set in an expression of gravity, and his eyes,
seemingly fixed on the void, showed an immense effort of
meditation. He perceived, however, that Josine was regarding him
with a look of admiration and boundless confidence, and he smiled
on her with an absentminded air without breaking the thread of his
ideas.</p>

<p>Motionless in his bonds, his face haggard with anxiety,
Beaumagnan listened. Was it really a fact that the tremendous
secret was about to be divulged?</p>

<p>Two or three more minutes passed in a dead silence. Then
Josephine murmured: "What's the matter with you, Ralph? You look
quite wrought up."</p>

<p>"Yes; I am," he said. "All this story of all this treasure
hidden in a block of stone, in full view of everyone who comes near
it, is in all conscience strange enough. But it's nothing, Josine,
nothing at all compared with the idea which dominates the story.
You cannot imagine how strange it is&mdash;and how beautiful! What
poetry and what simplicity!"</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment; then he declared sententiously:
"Josine, the monks of the middle ages were duffers." He looked
round on the three of them and added: "Goodness, yes; pious
personages, but, I repeat it at the risk of shaking your faith,
duffers! Just consider: if a great financier took it into his head
to protect his strongbox by writing on it, 'You are forbidden to
open it,' you would reckon him a duffer, wouldn't you? Well, the
method that these monks chose to protect their treasure is very
nearly as ingenuous."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;no&mdash;it is incredible!" she murmured. "You have
guessed wrong! You're making a mistake!"</p>

<p>"Duffers too, all those who have sought for it and found
nothing. Blind souls! Narrow minds! What? You, Leonard, Godfrey
d'Etigues, Beaumagnan, their friends, the whole of the Society of
Jesus, the Archbishop of Rouen, you had these five words under your
eyes; and it was not enough! Why, hang it all, a board-school child
solves problems as difficult as this!"</p>

<p>She raised the objection: "But, before everything, it was a
matter of one word and not of five."</p>

<p>"But it's there; the word's there, confound it! When I told you
a little while ago that the possession of the casket must have
revealed the indispensable word to the Baron and Beaumagnan, I just
wanted to frighten you and make you loose your hold on Clarice, for
these gentlemen were simply puzzled. But the indispensable word is
there, all right. It's there, mixed with the five Latin words.
Instead of blanching as you all did in the face of this vague
formula you ought, quite naively, to have read it, to have put the
first five letters together, and to have studied the word composed
of those five initials."</p>

<p>"But we thought of that," she said quickly. "It's the word
ALCOR, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes: the word ALCOR."</p>

<p>"Well, what about it?"</p>

<p>"What about it? But it contains everything, that word does! Do
you know what it means?" he said impatiently.</p>

<p>"It's an Arabian word which means a 'test.'"</p>

<p>"And which the Arabs and all other people use to designate
what?"</p>

<p>"A star."</p>

<p>"What star?"</p>

<p>"One of the stars in the constellation of the Great Bear. But
that's of no importance. What relation could there be&mdash;"</p>

<p>Ralph's lips were wreathed with a smile of pity; and he said
patiently: "Of course it's quite evident that the name of the star
could not have any relation with the situation of a block of stone
in the open country. One clings to this silly conclusion; and on
that side all effort comes to an end. But it is exactly that which
struck me when I got the word ALCOR from the five initials of the
Latin inscription. Master of the magic word, the talismanic word,
and having besides observed that the whole affair turned round the
number seven&mdash;<i>seven</i> abbeys, <i>seven</i> monks,
<i>seven</i> branches of the candlestick, <i>seven</i> stones of
<i>seven</i> colors set in <i>seven</i> rings&mdash;at once, d'you
hear? at once by a kind of reflex action of my mind I knew that the
star ALCOR was part of the constellation of the Great Bear; and the
problem was solved."</p>

<p>"Solved? How?"</p>

<p>"Hang it all. Because the constellation of the Great Bear is
formed of exactly seven principal stars! Seven! Always the number
seven! Do you begin to see the connection? Or am I to point out to
you once more that if the Arabs chose and if the astronomers since
accepted that designation of ALCOR, it is because this quite small
star which is scarcely visible serves as a test, do you understand,
as a test? To demonstrate that a certain person has good eyesight
because they can see it with the naked eye. ALCOR is what you must
see, what you must look for, the hidden thing, the concealed
treasure, the invisible block of stone into which one slips the
precious stones. It is the strong box."</p>

<p>Josephine, in a fever of excitement at the nearness of the great
revelation, murmured: "I don't understand."</p>

<p>Ralph pulled forward a chair into a position between Leonard and
the window which he had opened with the very distinct intention of
escaping the moment it be came necessary, and sat down on it. As he
spoke he was keeping a close watch on Leonard, who persistently
kept his hand on the revolver in his pocket.</p>

<p>"Well, you're going to understand," he said. "It's as clear as
the day, as spring water! Look."</p>

<p>He showed them the visiting card which he still held in his
hand.</p>

<p>"Look. I've had this on me for weeks. From the beginning of our
search I looked up in an atlas the exact position of the seven
abbeys, of which I have written the names on this card. Here they
are, all seven of them, in the different positions in which they
stand in regard to one another. Therefore all I had to do just now,
as soon as I knew the word, was to join the seven points by lines
to reach this unexpected conclusion, Josephine, this marvellous,
colossal, and yet very natural conclusion that the figure so formed
exactly represents the Great Bear. Do you grasp this really
astonishing truth? The seven abbeys of the Caux country, the seven
primordial abbeys into which flowed the riches of Christian France,
were placed in the same positions as the seven principal stars in
the Great Bear. There is no mistake about this. You have only to
take an atlas and join them by lines. It is the cabalistic design
of the Great Bear.</p>

<p>"After that the truth at once became clear. At the very spot at
which ALCOR is found in the Heavenly figure the block of stone will
inevitably be found a little to the right below the abbey which
corresponds to that star, that is to say a little to the right
below the abbey of Jumièges, formerly the most powerful and richest
of the abbeys of Normandy. It's a mathematical certainty. The block
of stone is there and nowhere else. Thereupon two facts stand out
uncommonly clear, in fact they stare you in the face: firstly that
a little to the southeast of Jumièges, scarcely a league away from
it, there is, at the hamlet of Mesnil-sous-Jumièges, quite close to
the Seine, the ruins of the Manor of Agnes Sorel, the mistress of
King Charles VII; secondly that the abbey communicated with that
manor by a subterranean passage of which you can still see the
entrance. The conclusion is that the legendary block of stone is
near the Manor of Agnes Sorel, on the bank of the Seine, and the
inscription doubtless means that the mistress of the King, his
Queen of Love, ran towards this block of stone, of the precious
contents of which she was ignorant, and sat down on it to watch the
royal barque glide down the old river of Normandy.</p>

<p>"<i>Ad lapidem currebat olim regina.</i>"</p>

<p>A common, deep silence united Ralph and Josephine. The veil was
raised. The light of day swept away the darkness. Between them it
appeared that all hatred had ceased. There was a truce to the
implacable conflicts which divided them and nothing remained but an
immense astonishment at having so penetrated the forbidden regions
of the mysterious past that time and space defended against human
curiosity.</p>

<p>Sitting near Josephine, his eyes fixed on the picture which he
had drawn, Ralph continued in a low voice with a restrained
exaltation:</p>

<p>"Yes, those monks were very imprudent to trust such a secret to
the guard of so transparent a word. But what ingenious and charming
poets they were! What a delightful thought to associate Heaven
itself with their earthly belongings! Masters of contemplation,
great astronomers like their Chaldean ancestors they drew their
inspiration from on high; the courses of the stars guided their
existence; and they called on the constellations themselves to
watch over their treasures. Who knows if the situation of their
seven abbeys was not chosen at the beginning of things to reproduce
on the soil of Normandy the gigantic figure of the Great Bear? Who
knows&mdash;"</p>

<p>The lyric effusion of Ralph was truly justified; but he could
not bring it to its proper end. If he was distrusting Leonard, he
had forgotten Josephine. Suddenly she struck him on the head with
her life preserver.</p>

<p>It was indeed the last thing he was looking for, although he
knew that these treacherous attacks were a habit of hers. Stunned,
he doubled up on his chair, then fell on his knees, then rolled
over and lay prone.</p>

<p>He murmured in a shaky voice: "It's true, begad! I was no longer
taboo." Then with the guttersnipe's chuckle which he doubtless
inherited from his father, Theophrastus Lupin, he said again: "The
damned jade! Not even respect for genius! You savage little beast,
have you indeed a stone where your heart should be?...All the worse
for you, Josephine. We would have shared the treasure. Now I'll
keep the lot of it."</p>

<p>He lost consciousness.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch13" id="ch13"></a>13. The Strongbox of the
Monks</h2>

<p>It was but a passing paralysis such as a boxer suffers from a
knockout blow. But when Ralph recovered consciousness he found
without the slightest surprise that he was in the same situation as
Beaumagnan, like him bound, and like him set with his back against
the wall.</p>

<p>He was very little more surprised to see Josephine stretched on
two chairs in front of the door, a victim of one of those nervous
attacks which too violent emotions, too prolonged always brought
on. The blow she had struck Ralph had thrown her into one of them.
Leonard was tending her, holding a bottle of smelling-salts to her
nostrils.</p>

<p>He must have summoned one of his confederates, for Ralph saw the
young man enter whom he knew by the name of Dominique, the young
man who had looked after the carriage in front of the house of
Bridget Rousselin.</p>

<p>"Damn it!" said the newcomer on perceiving the two captives.
"There seems to have been a squabble. Beaumagnan! d'Andresy! The
chief does strike hard! Result a fainting fit. What?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's nearly over," growled Leonard.</p>

<p>"What are we to do?"</p>

<p>"Carry her to the carriage and drive her to the
<i>Nonchalante</i>," growled Leonard.</p>

<p>"And what about me?"</p>

<p>"You're going to keep guard on these two," said Leonard nodding
towards the prisoners.</p>

<p>"Hang it! They're awkward customers. I don't like the job," said
Dominique, scowling at them.</p>

<p>Leonard took Josephine by the shoulders, Dominique by the
ankles. They raised her and were carrying her out, when, opening
her eyes, she said to them in a voice so low that she could not
suppose that Ralph's hearing was fine enough to catch a syllable of
what she said:</p>

<p>"No. I'll walk all right. You will stay here, Leonard. You're
the best man to guard Ralph."</p>

<p>"Let me knock him on the head and be done with it," whispered
Leonard. "This young fellow will bring us bad luck."</p>

<p>"I love him," she murmured.</p>

<p>"But he doesn't love you any longer."</p>

<p>"Yes. He will come back to me. Besides, whatever happens, I'm
not going to let him go."</p>

<p>"Then what do you propose to do?" asked Leonard glumly.</p>

<p>"The <i>Nonchalante</i> should be at Caudebec. I'm going to rest
there till early tomorrow morning. I must rest."</p>

<p>"And the treasure? It will need a gang to handle a stone of that
size."</p>

<p>"Tonight I'll send word to the Corbus to meet me tomorrow at
Jumièges. Then I'll see to Ralph&mdash;unless&mdash;But don't
bother me any more now. I'm done," she muttered.</p>

<p>"But what about Beaumagnan?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"We'll set him free when I have the treasure."</p>

<p>"Aren't you afraid that that girl will inform the police? It
would be an easy job for them to surround this old lighthouse."</p>

<p>"Nonsense! Do you think she's going to put the police on the
track of her father and Ralph?" said Josephine.</p>

<p>She sat up on one of the chairs and fell back again with a
groan. Some minutes passed. At last with an effort which seemed to
exhaust her she succeeded in standing upright, and resting on
Dominique, went to Ralph.</p>

<p>"He's insensible," she murmured. "Guard him carefully, Leonard,
and the other too. If one of them gets away, the game's up."</p>

<p>She went away slowly. Leonard accompanied her to the old
barouche and in a little while came back, after padlocking the
gate. He brought with him a parcel containing food. Then they heard
the sound of hoofs on the stony road.</p>

<p>Ralph had already discovered that he was securely bound. He said
to himself: "The chief is growing rather feeble. Firstly in talking
about the steps she proposes to take before witnesses; secondly in
entrusting stout fellows like Beaumagnan and me to the care of a
single man. Those are mistakes which prove that she's in a bad
state of health."</p>

<p>All the same it was true that Leonard's experience would render
any attempt to escape uncommonly difficult.</p>

<p>"Leave those ropes alone," he said to Ralph as he entered. "If
you don't I'll plug you on the jaw."</p>

<p>This formidable jailor took every precaution to make his task
easy. After running them through the back of a chair he tied
together the ends of the two ropes which bound the prisoners. Then
he propped the chair on two legs so that it would fall over easily,
and on it he set the dagger that Josephine had given him. If one of
the prisoners stirred the chair would fall over.</p>

<p>"You're less stupid than you look," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Shut your mouth or I'll plug you on the jaw," said Leonard.</p>

<p>He set about making a meal.</p>

<p>Ralph chanced saying: "I hope you're enjoying it. If there's any
over, don't forget me."</p>

<p>Leonard rose with his fists clenched.</p>

<p>"All right: I'll shut up," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Leonard sat down again.</p>

<p>The hours passed. It grew dusk. Beaumagnan appeared to be
asleep. Leonard smoked pipe after pipe, Ralph scolded himself for
having been so careless as not to have kept an eye on
Josephine.</p>

<p>"I ought to have been distrusting her all the time," he said to
himself. "I've a long way to go yet to make her value me at my true
worth. But what decision! What a clear view of the reality! And
what a freedom from scruples! Just one single defect which prevents
the monster from being perfect&mdash;her nervous system of a
degenerate. And lucky for me it is today that she has that nervous
system, since it will allow me to get to Mesnil-sous-Jumièges
before her."</p>

<p>He had not the slightest doubt that it was possible to escape
from Leonard. He had observed that the bonds which bound his ankles
were loosened by certain movements, and feeling sure of getting his
right leg free, he considered with satisfaction the effect of a
kick on the point of Leonard's jaw. After that, hell for leather to
the treasure!</p>

<p>The darkness thickened in the room. Leonard lit a candle, smoked
a last pipe, and drank a last glass of wine. After that he became
so sleepy that he nodded first to the right and then to the left
with such vigor that he nearly fell off his chair. Then he tried
holding the candle in his hand in order that the hot wax should
fall on it and wake him up. He took a look at the two prisoners,
another at the rope that ran through the back of the chair which
was to act as an alarm, and went to sleep.</p>

<p>Ralph worked away slowly and gently at the task of freeing
himself, not without success. It must be about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>"If I can get away at eleven o'clock," he said to himself, "I
shall reach Lillebonne by midnight, get some supper there, and at
three o'clock in the morning arrive at the sacred spot. With the
first light of dawn I shall put the strongbox of the monks into my
pocket&mdash;yes: into my pocket. I've no need of the Corbus, or
anyone else."</p>

<p>But at half-past ten he was practically at the same point.</p>

<p>Loose though the ropes were, he could not free his foot from
them, and he was beginning to give up hope when of a sudden he
thought he heard a slight noise which differed from all the
whisperings that break the deep silence of the night, leaves that
rustle, birds that flutter among the branches, murmurs of the
breeze.</p>

<p>The noise came again; and he was certain that it came from the
window he had opened, which Leonard had carelessly pushed to.</p>

<p>Then one side of the window seemed to be moving slowly
forward.</p>

<p>Ralph looked at Beaumagnan. He too had heard the noise and was
looking at the window.</p>

<p>Then the hot wax of the candle fell on Leonard's hand; and he
awoke. He looked at the bonds of the prisoners and the rope of the
alarm and dropped off to sleep again. The noise, which had for the
while ceased, came again&mdash;it was plain that the movements of
their jailor were being carefully watched.</p>

<p>What was going on? It was evident that since the gate was locked
someone must have climbed over the wall; and it must be someone
familiar with the light house who knew where to find a spot from
which the broken glass had been cleared. Who? A peasant? A poacher?
Was it a rescuer&mdash;some friend of Beaumagnan's? Or was it just
a prowler in the night?</p>

<p>A head appeared, indistinct in the darkness; and then the figure
of a woman slipped easily over the sill which was at no great
height from the ground.</p>

<p>Before he saw her face, Ralph knew that it was none other than
Clarice!</p>

<p>With what pride and delight and thankfulness did he regard her!
Josephine had been wrong, quite wrong in supposing her rival too
feeble to act. In her anxiety, unable to tear herself away in her
fear for his safety, mastering her exhaustion and her fear for
herself, she must have lurked in the wood in which the lighthouse
stood, and waited for the night.</p>

<p>And now she was attempting the impossible to save the man who
had so cruelly betrayed her.</p>

<p>Once more Leonard awoke. But fortunately she was directly behind
him. Once more he fell asleep and she moved noiselessly forward
till she stood beside him, reached forward, and picked up
Josephine's dagger which lay on the chair which was to act as alarm
and add by its jingle to the noise of its fall. Was she going to
strike?</p>

<p>Ralph was terrified. Now that the light of the candle clearly
illuminated her face, it seemed to him to be set in a cold
ferocity. But their eyes met, and she obeyed the unspoken bidding
of his will. She did not strike. Ralph bent forward a little so
that the rope which ran through the back of the chair hung slack.
Beaumagnan, seeing what he would be at, bent forward too.</p>

<p>Then slowly, with a steady hand, she cut the rope.</p>

<p>As luck had it, their enemy did not wake. Had he done so, she
would assuredly have killed him. Her eyes, still holding that
threat of death, never left him. She bent down, her hand fumbled
about for Ralph's bonds. She freed his wrists.</p>

<p>He whispered: "Give me the knife."</p>

<p>She handed it to him. But a hand was quicker than his.
Beaumagnan who for hours had also been patiently at work, loosening
his bonds, snatched the knife from her.</p>

<p>Furious, Ralph gripped his arm. If Beaumagnan loosed himself and
got away before he did, farewell all hope of seizing the treasure.
There was a desperate struggle, in which either of them put forth
all his strength, telling himself that the least noise would wake
Leonard.</p>

<p>Clarice, trembling with fear, sank to her knees, quite as much
in order not to fall to the ground as to beseech them.</p>

<p>But Beaumagnan's wound, slight though it was, rendered him
incapable of prolonged resistance. He let go the knife.</p>

<p>At that very moment Leonard moved his head, opened his eyes, and
gazed at the picture before him, the two men half risen, clinging
to one another in a fighting attitude, Clarice on her knees.</p>

<p>His gaze rested on it several seconds, several terrible seconds,
for there was no doubt that, seeing what they were at, he would
shoot them down, and rid himself of them. But his open eyes did not
see them; they were blinded by the clouds of sleep. His eyelids
closed down again over them before the consciousness of what they
rested on came to him.</p>

<p>Thereupon Ralph cut through the rest of his bonds. He was free.
As Clarice rose, trembling, to her feet, he whispered: "Be quick!
Escape!"</p>

<p>She shook her head and pointed to Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>It was plain that she was not going to leave him behind her, a
prisoner exposed to the vengeance of Leonard.</p>

<p>Ralph protested; but he could not move her.</p>

<p>Tiring of the conflict, he handed the knife to Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"She's right," he said in a whisper. "One must play fair. Here
you are. Free yourself. And afterwards let each look out for
himself. What?"</p>

<p>He followed Clarice to the window. One after the other, they
slipped over the sill. Once in the enclosure, she took his hand and
led him to a gap in the wall.</p>

<p>He helped her through it.</p>

<p>But when he had climbed through it himself, he no longer saw
anyone.</p>

<p>"Clarice!" he cried. "Where are you?"</p>

<p>The wood lay in the darkness of a starless night. He heard a
rustling among the undergrowth on his right. He plunged into it in
pursuit and ran into tree-trunks and brushes that barred his way.
He was compelled to return to the path.</p>

<p>"She flies from me," he said to himself sadly. "When I was a
prisoner, she risked everything to free me. Now that I am free, she
does not want to set eyes on me again. My treachery, that monster
Josephine, and the whole disgusting business have filled her with
horror."</p>

<p>As he regained the path, someone came tumbling over the wall. It
was Beaumagnan, escaping in his turn. Then of a sudden reports of a
revolver banged out from some quarter. Leonard had rushed to the
gap and was firing at random into the wood. Ralph made haste to get
out of range.</p>

<p>So, at about eleven o'clock at night, the three adversaries
started from the same point to get to the Queen's stone, more than
thirty miles away. What were their different mean of getting there?
Everything depended on that.</p>

<p>On the one side were Beaumagnan and Leonard, both of them well
provided with confederates, and at the head of powerful
organizations. Beaumagnan's friends must be waiting for him;
Leonard had but to get to Josephine; the spoil belonged to
whichever was quickest. But Ralph was the youngest and most active.
If he had not made the mistake of leaving his bicycle at
Lillebonne, every chance would have been in his favor.</p>

<p>It must be admitted that he instantly abandoned his search for
Clarice and that the pursuit of the treasure became his only care.
Walking and running he covered the seven miles to Lillebonne in
less than an hour. It was a little before midnight that he awoke
the porter of his hotel, made a hasty meal. Then, having wrapped up
two small dynamite cartridges in brown paper and thrust them into
his pocket, he mounted his machine. Neatly rolled up and fastened
below the handlebar was a canvas bag in which to bring away the
spoil.</p>

<p>He made the following calculations: "From Lillebonne to
Mesnil-sous-Jumièges is about twenty-five miles. I ought to be
there before daybreak. The moment it is light I shall find the
block of granite and blow it up with the dynamite. It is possible
that Josephine or Beaumagnan may surprise me in the middle of the
operation. In that case I go halves. All the worse for the third
party."</p>

<p>Having passed Caudebec-en-Caux, he followed along the rising
ground the road which runs through the woods and meadows to the
Seine. Just as on the day on which he had first made love to
Josephine, the <i>Nonchalante</i> was there, looming large through
the dim light. He saw that the window of the cabin which she
occupied was lit up.</p>

<p>"She must be dressing," he said to himself. "Her carriage will
be coming for her. Perhaps Leonard has got to her and made her
start sooner than she intended. Too late, my lady!"</p>

<p>He drove on the machine as hard as he could. But half an hour
later, as he was riding down a steep hill, he felt his wheel meet
some obstacle; and he flew over the handles, over a heap of stones
by the road side, and came to a stop scratched and bruised, but
with no bones broken, in a thick and thorny bush twenty feet down
the hill.</p>

<p>Two men&mdash;he saw them dimly&mdash;came out of the bushes and
hurried to his bicycle.</p>

<p>"It was him! It must have been him! The rope got the machine! I
told you it would," cried Oscar de Bennetot in a tone of great
excitement.</p>

<p>"Yes. But where's he got to?" growled Godfrey d'Etigues.</p>

<p>Ralph made haste to scramble up through the bushes to the top of
the high embankment.</p>

<p>They heard him; but they could not see him. They rushed after
him, cursing furiously. But they had little chance of finding him
in that darkness.</p>

<p>Then Beaumagnan's voice came faintly from below: "Don't bother
about him! We've no time to waste! Smash his machine! That puts him
out of action."</p>

<p>They made haste to obey. Ralph heard them go bustling down to
the road. Then he heard them stamping on the wheels of his
bicycle.</p>

<p>Then Beaumagnan said: "Come on! The horse has rested long
enough. We've got to get there quickly. Confound this wound of
mine. The bandage has shifted; I'm bleeding like a pig."</p>

<p>Apparently they did as he bade them, for half a minute later
there came a crunching of wheels and a carriage started and went
down the hill at a good pace. Indomitable, Ralph took the canvas
bag from the wreck of his bicycle, and set off after it at a steady
trot.</p>

<p>He was furious. Nothing in the world would have induced him to
abandon the struggle. It was no longer merely a matter of millions
and millions which would make the rest of his life magnificent, his
vanity was up in arms. Having solved the insoluble enigma, he must
be the first to arrive at the goal. Not to be there, not to seize
the treasure, to let someone else take it, would have been an
intolerable humiliation to the day of his death.</p>

<p>So, indefatigable, he toiled on behind the carriage, and not so
far behind it either, buoyed up by the thought that the enigma was
not yet solved in its entirety, that his adversaries, like himself,
had yet to find the actual place in which the block of granite
stood; and in that darkness it was going to take time. While they
were doing it, he might once more get the better of them.</p>

<p>Then Fortune relented and helped him. As he entered Jumièges he
saw in front of him the wavering light of a lantern, heard the
tinkle of a bell, and, where as his adversaries had gone straight
through the village, he dropped into a quiet walk. Then he met the
priest of Jumièges, who, accompanied by a small boy, was returning
from administering extreme unction. Ralph dropped into step beside
him, asked where he could find an inn, and in the course of their
talk as they went in the direction of that inn, pretending that he
was an archæologist, spoke of a curious stone which he had been
told he would find in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>"The dolmen of the queen, or something of that kind, they told
me it was called," said Ralph. "You ought to know that object of
interest, Monsieur le curé?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do, monsieur," said the priest. "I'm pretty sure
that it must be what we call Agnes Sorel's stone."</p>

<p>"It's at Mesnil-sous-Jumièges, isn't it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's where it is, about two and a half miles away. But it's
hardly an object of interest&mdash;just a group of small rocks
emerging from a mound, the tallest of which is three or four feet
above the Seine."</p>

<p>"It's on common land, isn't it?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"It was a few years ago, but the Commune sold it to one of my
parishioners, a M. Simon Thuilard who wished to extend his
meadow-land."</p>

<p>Immensely pleased, Ralph took his leave of the priest, provided
with minute directions for finding the stone. They enabled him to
avoid the big village of Jumièges, plunge into the network of
winding roads which lead to Mesnil-sous-Jumièges, with the result
that he got ahead of his adversaries.</p>

<p>"If they haven't taken the precaution to provide themselves with
a guide, they're certain to miss their way," he said to himself.
"It is impossible to take a carriage straight, such a dark night as
this. And then how are they to pick the right road? Where are they
to look for the stone? Beaumagnan is exhausted and Godfrey
d'Etigues is hardly intelligent enough to find it by himself. I
fancy I win this hand."</p>

<p>At a few minutes to three, he crossed the fence which ran round
the property of Simon Thuilard.</p>

<p>A couple of matches showed him the path across the meadow. At
the end of it he came to an embankment, which seemed to him of
recent construction, along the side of the river. He arrived at the
right end of it and moved down it to the left. Then, not wishing to
use up all his matches, he waited for the dawn.</p>

<p>Already there was a strip of gray sky along the edge of the
Eastern horizon.</p>

<p>He waited, full of a pleasant emotion which wreathed his lips
with a smile. The block of granite was near him, not many feet
away. For centuries, at this very hour of the night perhaps, the
monks had come furtively to this very spot on the broad earth to
bury their treasure. One by one, priors and treasurers had come by
the subterranean passage which led from the abbey to the Manor.
Others doubtless had come in boats along the old river of Normandy
which ran through Paris and ran through Rouen, the waves of which
broke against the estates of three of the seven sacred abbeys.</p>

<p>And now he, Ralph d'Andresy, was a sharer of the great secret.
He was the heir of the thousands and thousands of monks who had
worked in those distant ages, sown throughout the length and
breadth of France and gathered in their harvest without a pause.
What a miracle! To have at his age such a dream come true! To be an
equal of the most powerful and to rule among the lords of the
world!</p>

<p>In the paling heaven the Great Bear was fading. You divined,
rather than saw, the luminous point of Alcor, the cabalistic star
which, in the vast expanse of the Heavens, corresponded to the
little block of granite on which Ralph was about to lay the hand of
the conqueror. The stream babbled against the bank in quiet little
waves. The surface of the river rose out of the darkness in shining
patches of light.</p>

<p>He walked along the embankment. He began to discern the contours
and colors of things. A solemn instant! His heart was beating
quickly. Then of a sudden thirty yards away he saw a mound of
ground which scarcely rose above the level of the meadow, and in
which, among the grass which covered it rose some points of gray
rock.</p>

<p>"It's there!" he murmured, moved to the very depths of his
being. "It's there! I have reached the goal!"</p>

<p>His hands were fumbling with the dynamite cartridges in his
pocket and his eyes were seeking wildly the higher stone of which
that priest of Jumièges had spoken. Was it this one, or that? A few
seconds would be enough for him to introduce the cartridge into the
cracks which earth and plants choked. Three minutes later he would
be heaping the diamonds and rubies into the bag which he took from
his knapsack. If there remained a few crumbs among the debris all
the better for his enemies.</p>

<p>He walked forward and the nearer he came to it the more the
mound took on an appearance which did not at all conform to what he
expected. There was no higher stone...There was no block which, in
days gone by, would have afforded to her whom they called the Lady
of Beauty, a seat from which to look for the arrival of the royal
barque round the corner of the reach of the river. Nothing rose
above the mound&mdash;on the contrary its top was level. What had
happened? Had some sudden rush of the river, or some storm lately
changed a spot which the storms of ages had respected? or
had&mdash;</p>

<p>In two bounds Ralph crossed the ten paces which separated him
from the mound.</p>

<p>An oath burst from his lips. The horrible truth was clear to his
eyes. The center of the mound had been disembowled. The block of
granite, the legendary block was indeed there, but smashed asunder
into fragments, its debris on every side of a gaping hole full of
blackened pebbles and tufts of grass. Not a single jewel! Not a
scrap of gold or silver! The enemy had passed that way.</p>

<p>Ralph did not stand before this paralyzing spectacle for more
than a minute. Motionless, speechless, he studied it
absentmindedly, and mechanically gathered in all the traces and
evidence of the work that had been done some hours before; he
marked the prints of a woman's heel; but he refused to draw from
them the only logical conclusion. He walked away from it, lit a
cigarette and sat down on the bank of the dyke on the edge of the
river.</p>

<p>He did not wish to think. The defeat, and above all the fashion
in which it had been inflicted on him, was too painful for him to
suffer himself to study its causes and effects. At such moments one
can only strive to retain one's coolness. But, in spite of
everything, the events of the preceding afternoon and evening
forced themselves on his attention. Whether he wished it, or not,
the actions of Josephine Balsamo unfolded themselves before his
mind. He saw her striving firmly against that nervous attack and
recovering all the energy necessary at such a juncture. Rest when
the hour of destiny had struck? Not she! Had he rested? And
Beaumagnan, wounded as he was, had he allowed himself the slightest
respite? No! And Josephine Balsamo would never make such a mistake.
Before nightfall she had reached the meadow with her agents; and
then in the daylight and later by the light of lanterns, she had
directed their work. And when he, Ralph, had divined her presence
behind the curtained window of her cabin, she was not making ready
for the final expedition; she had returned from it, once more
victorious because she never allowed mischances, futile hesitation,
or superfluous scruples to prove an obstacle between her and the
immediate execution of her designs.</p>

<p>For more than twenty minutes, letting himself relax from his
fatigue in the warmth of the sun which rose above the hills on the
opposite bank, Ralph considered the bitter reality into which had
sunk his dreams of domination. He must indeed have been deeply
absorbed in those bitter reflections not to hear the noise of a
carriage which stopped in the road and see the three men who got
out of it, climb over the fence and cross the meadow till the very
moment at which one of them, on reaching the mound, uttered a cry
of anguish.</p>

<p>It was Beaumagnan; his two friends were supporting him.</p>

<p>If the disappointment of Ralph was deep, what must have been the
despair of a man who had staked all his life on the mysterious
treasure! Livid, with starting eyes, the bandage which ran across
his shoulder oozing blood, he gazed stupidly, as at the most
horrible of spectacles, at the spot on which the miraculous stone
had been violated. One would have said that the world was falling
in ruins about his feet and that he was gazing into a gulf of
terror and horror.</p>

<p>Ralph came forward and murmured: "Her work."</p>

<p>Beaumagnan did not answer him. There was no doubt whatever that
it was her work. Must it not be that the image of that woman
mingled with everything disastrous and overwhelming, with every
cataclysm charged with infernal suffering?</p>

<p>Had he any need, like his companions, to leap into the hole and
ransack its chaos for some forgotten scrap of the treasure? No!
After the passage of the sorceress there was nothing but dust and
ashes. She was the great scourge which devastates and slays. She
was the very incarnation of the Principle of Evil. She was
nothingness and death!</p>

<p>He drew himself to his full height, always theatrical and
romantic in his most natural attitudes, gazed round him with
dolorous eyes, then, of a sudden, crossed himself, and drove into
his breast the blade of a dagger&mdash;of the dagger which belonged
to Josephine Balsamo.</p>

<p>The action was so sudden and so unexpected that no one could
have prevented it. Before his friends and Ralph had even grasped
what he had done, Beaumagnan tumbled into the hole among the debris
of what had been the strongbox of the monks.</p>

<p>His friends sprang to him.</p>

<p>He was still breathing and he muttered: "A priest&mdash;a
priest."</p>

<p>De Bennetot hurried away. Some peasants passed. He questioned
them and sprang into the carriage.</p>

<p>On his knees beside his chief, Godfrey d'Etigues was praying and
striking his breast. Doubtless Beaumagnan had revealed to him that
Josephine Balsamo was still alive and knew all his crimes. The
suicide of his chief on the top of that revelation had shattered
his mind. His face was convulsed with terror.</p>

<p>Ralph bent down over Beaumagnan and in slow and measured accents
said: "I swear to you that I will find her. I swear to you that I
will take the treasure from her."</p>

<p>Love and hate still persisted in the heart of the dying man.
Such words alone could prolong his existence for a few fleeting
minutes. At the hour of his agony, in the shattering of all his
dreams, he clung desperately to every chance of reprisal and
vengeance.</p>

<p>His eyes summoned Ralph, who bent down lower and heard him
mutter: "Clarice&mdash;Clarice d'Etigues&mdash;you must marry her.
Listen&mdash;Clarice is not the daughter of the Baron&mdash;he
confessed it to me&mdash;she is the daughter of another woman he
loved."</p>

<p>Ralph said solemnly: "I swear to you I will marry her&mdash;I
swear it."</p>

<p>"Godfrey!" said Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>The Baron went on praying. Ralph laid a hand on his shoulder and
made him bend down to catch Beaumagnan's faint utterance.</p>

<p>"Clarice is to marry d'Andresy. I wish it."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the Baron, incapable of resistance.</p>

<p>"Swear it."</p>

<p>"I swear it."</p>

<p>"By your eternal salvation?"</p>

<p>"By my eternal salvation."</p>

<p>"You will give him your money that he may avenge us&mdash;all
the wealth you have stolen. Swear it!" said Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>"By the eternal salvation," said the Baron.</p>

<p>"He knows all your crimes. He has proofs of them," Beaumagnan
continued. "If you do not obey me, he will hand you over to the
police."</p>

<p>"I will obey."</p>

<p>"May you be accursed, if you do not," said Beaumagnan.</p>

<p>His voice was growing fainter broken by harsh gasps between
which the words came more and more indistinct. Bent down, with his
ear a little above his mouth, Ralph just caught them.</p>

<p>"You'll pursue her, Ralph...You must tear the jewels from
her...She's a devil...Listen...I have discovered...At Havre...She
has a vessel...The <i>Glow-worm</i>...Listen."</p>

<p>He was at the very end of his strength. Nevertheless Ralph yet
heard:</p>

<p>"Go...At once...Hunt her down...This very day."</p>

<p>His eyes closed, the death rattle began.</p>

<p>Godfrey d'Etigues still went on beating his breast, on his knees
at the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>Ralph left them.</p>

<p><br>
That evening one of the Paris papers published in its final issue
the following paragraph:</p>

<p class="newspaper">M. Beaumagnan, a barrister well known in
militant royalist circles, whose death in Spain had already been
reported by mistake, committed suicide this morning at a village in
Normandy of the name of Mesnil-sous-Jumièges, on the banks of the
Seine. The reasons for this suicide are absolutely mysterious. Two
of his friends, Baron d'Etigues and M. Oscar de Bennetot, who were
with him, declare that they were spending the night at the château
de Tancarville, where they were staying for some days, when
Monsieur Beaumagnan awoke them. He was wounded and in a state of
great agitation. He insisted on their harnessing a horse to a
dogcart and driving at once to Jumièges and from there to a meadow
near Mesnil-sous-Jumièges. Why? Why this nocturnal expedition to a
lonely meadow? Why this suicide? Questions to which they can give
no answer.</p>

<p>The next day the Havre papers published accounts of an incident
which are summed up fairly well in the following article:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Last night Prince Lavosneff, who had come to
Havre to try a yacht which he had recently purchased, witnessed a
terrible drama. He was returning to the French coast when he saw a
column of flame about a mile and a half away and heard a loud
explosion&mdash;an explosion, by the way, which was heard at
several places along the coast. The Prince at once steered his
yacht towards the spot at which this sinister incident had taken
place, and there he found fragments of a wreck. On one of them was
a sailor whom they succeeded in rescuing. But they had hardly the
time to learn from him that the wrecked vessel was called the
<i>Glow-worm</i> and belonged to the Countess of Cagliostro, when
all at once he sprang overboard again crying: "There she is! There
she is!"<br>
<br>
By the light of the ship's lanterns they perceived another fragment
of the wreck, to which a woman was clinging, with her head just
above the water. The man succeeded in swimming to her and getting
hold of her. But she clung to him so tightly that she prevented him
using his arms, and the two of them sank. All efforts to find them
were vain.<br>
<br>
On his return to Havre Prince Lavosneff made a deposition to this
effect, which was also signed by four of his crew.</p>

<p>The paper added:</p>

<p class="newspaper">Later information leads us to believe that the
Countess of Cagliostro was an adventuress well known under the name
of Pellegrini and sometimes also under the name of Balsamo. Wanted
by the police, who had two or three times just missed capturing her
in localities in the Caux country, where she had recently been
operating, she must have decided to go abroad, and in this way
perished with her confederates in the wreck of her yacht, the
<i>Glow-worm</i>. We must also mention, with all proper
reservations, that there is a rumor to the effect that there is a
close connection between certain adventures of the Countess of
Cagliostro and the mysterious drama at Mesnil-sous-Jumièges. There
is a story going about of treasure unearthed and stolen, of plots
and documents of great antiquity. But at this point we enter the
domain of fable. We will stop therefore and leave it to justice to
throw light on the affair.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the day on which this article appeared, that
is to say exactly sixty hours after the drama at
Mesnil-sous-Jumièges, Ralph entered the study of the Baron Godfrey
at Haie d'Etigues, the study into which he had made his way one
night four months before. How many roads had he traversed since
that night and how many years older had he grown than the stripling
he then was!</p>

<p>At a small table the two cousins were drinking, at a
considerable pace, a bottle of brandy.</p>

<p>Without beating about the bush, Ralph said: "I have come to
claim the hand of Mademoiselle d'Etigues."</p>

<p>He was hardly wearing the correct costume in which to ask a
lady's hand in marriage. He was hatless and dressed in an old
fisherman's jersey and trousers much too short for him which
revealed his bare feet in grass shoes without any laces.</p>

<p>But Ralph's costume and his errand were of very little interest
to Godfrey d'Etigues. Hollow-eyed, with the face of one of the
damned, he held out towards Ralph a bundle of newspapers and
groaned:</p>

<p>"Have you seen them? The Countess?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know all that," said Ralph.</p>

<p>He detested the man; and he could not refrain from adding: "All
the better for you. What? The definite death of Josephine Balsamo
must have lifted a heavy burden from your mind."</p>

<p>"But the sequel&mdash;the consequences!" stammered the
Baron.</p>

<p>"What consequences?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"The law. It's sure to try to get at the bottom of this
business. People are already saying that Josephine Balsamo was
mixed up with the suicide of Beaumagnan. If the police get hold of
all the threads of the affair they will go further&mdash;to the
very end of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ralph in a jeering tone, "to the Widow Rousselin and
the murder of Jaubert. That's to say to you and cousin de
Bennetot."</p>

<p>The two men shuddered. Ralph set their minds at rest.</p>

<p>"You can drink at your ease, both of you," he said. "Justice
will not throw any light on this dark story, for the excellent
reason that it will do its best on the contrary to bury it in
oblivion. Beaumagnan was protected by powers who like neither
scandal nor the light of day. The business will be hushed up. The
thing that troubles me much more is not the action of the
law&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What is it?" said the Baron.</p>

<p>"The vengeance of Josephine Balsamo," said Ralph somberly.</p>

<p>"But if she's dead&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Even dead, she is formidable," said Ralph gravely. "And that's
why I am here. There is at the bottom of the park a small keeper's
lodge. I'm going to install myself in it&mdash;till our marriage.
Inform Clarice that I am here and tell her to allow no one to visit
her&mdash;not even me. Perhaps however she will accept this present
from me since we are engaged; and I beg you to give it to her from
me."</p>

<p>And he handed to the astonished Baron a huge sapphire, of an
incomparable fineness, and cut as they used to cut precious stones
in an earlier age.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>14. The Infernal Creature</h2>

<p>"Let go the anchor and lower a boat," said Josephine.</p>

<p>A thick mist rested on the sea, which, along with the darkness
of the night, prevented them from seeing the lights of Etretat.
Even the lamp of Cape Antifer lighthouse could not pierce the
impenetrable fog through which the yacht of Prince Lavosneff was
groping its way.</p>

<p>"Why are you sure that we are in sight of land?" Leonard
asked.</p>

<p>"Because I desire it so keenly," said Josephine.</p>

<p>He lost his temper: "This expedition is foolishness&mdash;pure
foolishness," he said. "What? It's a fortnight since we succeeded
and that, thanks to you, we gained the most extraordinary victory.
The whole mass of those precious stones is safe in the strongroom
of a bank in London. All danger is over. The Countess of
Cagliostro, Madam Pellegrini, Madam Balsamo, the Marquise de
Belmonte, are all at the bottom of the sea, as a result of the
shipwreck of the <i>Glow-worm</i> which you had the admirable idea
of organizing and which you directed with such vigor. Twenty
witnesses heard the explosion from the coast. To all the world you
are dead, a hundred times dead, and I as well, and all your
confederates. If anyone succeeded in bringing to light the story of
the treasure of the monks, they would come to the conclusion that
it had been scattered about with the fragments of the
<i>Glow-worm</i> at a place impossible to fix exactly, and that the
jewels are strewn about in the bottom of the sea. And we may well
believe that Justice is delighted with this shipwreck and our
deaths, and that it is not going to look too closely into the
matter, such efforts have been made in high places to hush up the
Beaumagnan-Cagliostro affair. Everything then is going well. You
are the mistress of circumstances and victorious over all your
enemies. And it is the moment at which the most elementary prudence
bids us leave France and to get as far as possible away from
Europe. And that's the very moment you choose to return to the very
place in which you have suffered your worst defeats, and to
confront the only enemy who remains. And what an enemy! A genius of
a kind so exceptional, that, without him you would never have
discovered the treasure. You must admit that it's madness."</p>

<p>She murmured: "Love is a madness."</p>

<p>"Then give it up."</p>

<p>"I can't give it up. I love him."</p>

<p>She rested her elbows on the bulwarks, her head between her
hands, and murmured in despairing accents: "I love him. It's the
first time I have ever loved. The other men&mdash;they don't count.
But as for Ralph but I don't want to talk about him. Thanks to him
I have known the only joy I ever had&mdash;but also the greatest
suffering. Before I met him I did not know what happiness was; but
I did not know sorrow either. And then&mdash;and then the happiness
came to an end; and only the suffering is left. It's horrible,
Leonard! The idea that he is going to marry&mdash;that another is
going to share his life, is more than I can bear. Anything rather
than that! I would rather risk anything&mdash;I would rather
die!"</p>

<p>He said in a low voice: "My poor Josine."</p>

<p>They were silent for some time. She leaned on the rail huddled
together and despairing. Then when the boat was lowered, she drew
herself upright, imperious and implacable.</p>

<p>"But I risk nothing, Leonard&mdash;neither death nor failure,"
she said.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he said in a tone of patient
resignation.</p>

<p>"I'm going to carry him off."</p>

<p>"You hope to do that?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Everything is ready. The smallest details have been worked
out."</p>

<p>"How?" he said in an incredulous tone.</p>

<p>"By the agency of Dominique."</p>

<p>"Ah! I was wondering what had become of Dominique," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes; directly after the coup, even before Ralph went to La Haie
d'Etigues, Dominique got employed there as a groom."</p>

<p>"But Ralph knows him."</p>

<p>"Ralph has seen him once or twice at the most; and you know how
clever Dominique is at disguising his face. It's impossible that he
should recognize him among all the staff of the château and the
stables. Dominique then, following my instructions, has kept me
informed of what is going on day by day. I know the hours at which
Ralph goes to bed and gets up, how he spends his time, and
everything he does. I know that he has not yet seen Clarice again,
but that he has sent for the papers necessary for the
marriage."</p>

<p>"Does he suspect anything?"</p>

<p>"As far as I'm concerned, he does not. Dominique heard scraps of
a conversation which he had with Godfrey d'Etigues the day he came
to the château. Neither of them had the slightest doubt about my
death. But none the less Ralph wished them to take all possible
precautions against me, though I was dead. Therefore he is on guard
over the château. He is keeping watch, continually on guard, and
always questioning the peasants."</p>

<p>"And Dominique has let you come?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but only for an hour. One bold swift stroke, at night, and
immediate flight."</p>

<p>"And it's tonight, is it?" he said anxiously.</p>

<p>"Yes, tonight between ten and eleven. Ralph is living at an
isolated keeper's lodge, not far from the old tower to which
Beaumagnan had me taken. That lodge is let into the big wall of the
park. And on the other side of it, which looks on the country,
there is only one window, on the ground floor, and no door. If the
shutters are closed, to get into it you have to go round through
the park gates and along the inside of the wall. The two keys will
be under a stone close to the park gates tonight. When Ralph is
asleep we shall roll him up in his mattress and blankets and bring
him here. The moment we've got him, we set sail."</p>

<p>"Is that all?" said Leonard.</p>

<p>Josephine hesitated before she replied: "That's all."</p>

<p>"And what about Dominique?"</p>

<p>"He will go with us."</p>

<p>Leonard bent forward, tried to see her face clearly in the
darkness, and said: "You haven't given him any special orders?"</p>

<p>"What about?"</p>

<p>"About Clarice. You hate that girl. Therefore I'm afraid that
you may have entrusted Dominique with some job."</p>

<p>She hesitated again before replying: "That's no business of
yours."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless&mdash;" he said doubtfully.</p>

<p>The ladder was let down for them to get into the boat. Josephine
said in a mocking tone: "Listen, Leonard. Since I created you
Prince Lavosneff and provided you with a yacht splendidly fitted
out, you have become extraordinarily discreet. But we'll stick to
our agreement, if you don't mind. I command: you obey. You have the
right to an explanation. I have given it to you. Act as if it was
sufficient."</p>

<p>"It is sufficient," said Leonard glumly. "And I recognize that
you have laid your plans admirably."</p>

<p>"All the better. Let's be starting."</p>

<p>She led the way down the ladder and settled herself in the stern
of the boat.</p>

<p>Leonard and four of their confederates followed him. Two of them
took the oars, another the rudder-strings, she directed their
course in a low voice.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later, though her followers had the
impression that they were moving forward blindly, she said: "We're
passing Amont harbor."</p>

<p>From time to time she warned the steersman of rocks that rose
above the surface of the sea and directed his course by landmarks
invisible to the rest of them. The crunching of the keel upon the
pebbles was the first thing to inform them that they had reached
the beach. They carried her ashore, then beached the boat.</p>

<p>"You're quite certain that we shan't meet any coast guards?"
whispered Leonard.</p>

<p>"Quite certain. Dominique's last telegram was quite
definite."</p>

<p>"Isn't he coming to meet us?" asked Leonard.</p>

<p>"No. I wrote to him to remain at the château among the other
servants. He will meet us at eleven."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Near Ralph's lodge. Don't talk any more."</p>

<p>All of them were lost to sight in the priest's staircase. Once
in it, Josephine lit a bull's-eye lantern she had brought with her.
They mounted the staircase, in silence.</p>

<p>On the top of the cliff the mist was much thinner. At intervals
there were gaps in it through which they could see the stars.
Therefore Josephine was at once able to point out to them La Haie
d'Etigues, many of the front windows of which were lit up. The
clock of Benouville church struck ten. Josephine shivered.</p>

<p>"Oh, the striking of that clock! How well I recognize it! Ten
strokes like the last time I heard it&mdash;ten strokes&mdash;one
after the other! I counted them as I was going to my death."</p>

<p>"Well, you avenged yourself all right," said Leonard.</p>

<p>"On Beaumagnan, yes. But the others&mdash;"</p>

<p>"On the others too. The two cousins are half mad."</p>

<p>"It's true," she said. "But I shall not feel myself fully
avenged for an hour. Then I shall be able to rest."</p>

<p>They waited for the mist to drift over again in order that their
figures might not stand out against the bare plain they had to
traverse. Then Josephine led the way along the path, along which
Godfrey and his friends had carried her to the priest's staircase.
The others followed in single file without saying a word. The grass
had been cut; here and there stood large haycocks.</p>

<p>As they drew near to La Haie d'Etigues the path ran between high
banks covered with bushes between which they marched with growing
carefulness.</p>

<p>The wall rose in front of them. A few more steps, and the lodge,
in which Ralph had taken up his abode, came into view. Josephine
halted them with a gesture.</p>

<p>"Wait for me," she said.</p>

<p>"Shall I come with you?" Leonard asked.</p>

<p>"No. I will come back for you and we will go into the park
together through the gate which is on the other side of it, on our
left."</p>

<p>She went forward alone, therefore, setting down her feet so
carefully that no stone rolled under her sole and no leaf rustled
at the contact of her skirt. She came to the window of the keeper's
lodge.</p>

<p>She took hold of the shutters very gently. The fastenings, with
which Dominique had tampered, did not hold them together. She
opened them till a little light came through the opening. Then she
glued her eye to it and looked into a room, on the further side of
which was a recess with a bed in it.</p>

<p>Ralph was in the bed. A lamp, with a crystal globe and a
cardboard shade on the top of it, showed clearly in the circle of
its light his face, his shoulders, the book he was reading, and his
clothes heaped up on the chair beside the bed. He looked young
indeed, with something of the air of a boy who is giving all his
attention to a task, but at the same time struggling against sleep.
Several times his head dropped forward. He awoke, forced himself to
read, and again dozed off.</p>

<p>At length he shut his book and put out the lamp.</p>

<p>Having seen what she wanted to see, Josephine left her post and
returned to her confederates. She had already given her
instructions, but she took the precaution of repeating them.</p>

<p>"Above all, no unnecessary roughness," she insisted. "You
understand, Leonard? Since he has no weapon within reach with which
to defend himself, there will be no need for you to use your
weapons. There are five of you; and that's enough."</p>

<p>"But suppose he does resist?" said Leonard.</p>

<p>"It's for you to act in such a manner that he can't resist," she
said coldly with a touch of menace in her tone.</p>

<p>She had learned her way about so thoroughly, from the maps with
which Dominique had supplied her, that she led them without
hesitating a moment to the principal entry into the park. They
found the keys, of the park gate and the door of Ralph's lodge, at
the place agreed upon. They opened the park gate and took their way
along the wall to the lodge.</p>

<p>The key turned in the well-oiled lock of its door without a
sound; noiselessly the door opened on well-oiled hinges. Followed
by her confederates, she entered. On the other side of the tiled
hall was the door of the bedroom. She pushed it open with infinite
slowness.</p>

<p>It was the decisive moment. If Ralph had not been awakened but
was sleeping still, Josephine's plot would be successful. She
listened. Nothing stirred. Then she stepped aside to make way for
the five men and by letting the ray from the bull's-eye fall on the
bed, gave the signal to her pack.</p>

<p>The assault was so swift that the sleeper could not have
awakened before all resistance was useless. The gang had rolled him
up in his blankets and pulled the mattress round him, and wound a
rope round it in less than ten seconds. In less than twenty seconds
the rope was securely tied. There had not been a cry; not a piece
of furniture had been knocked out of its place.</p>

<p>Once more Josephine was victorious.</p>

<p>"Splendid!" she said in a tone of excitement which revealed the
importance she attached to this victory. "Splendid! We've got him.
And this time every precaution shall be taken to prevent him from
getting away."</p>

<p>"What are we to do now?" Leonard asked.</p>

<p>"Carry him to the boat."</p>

<p>"Suppose he shouts for help?"</p>

<p>"Gag him. But he can't shout. Off you go!"</p>

<p>The four men stood up, bearing on their shoulders a burden which
looked like a great bundle of linen. Leonard came to Josephine.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming with us?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I told you: I'm waiting for Dominique."</p>

<p>She lit the lamp and raised the shade of it.</p>

<p>"How pale you're looking," he said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I am," she said defiantly.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's about that girl."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Dominique's at work, is he?"</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"Who knows? There may still be time to stop him!"</p>

<p>"Even if there were, I should not change my mind. It's made up.
What will be, will be. Besides, the thing is done. Off you go!"</p>

<p>"But why shouldn't we wait for you?"</p>

<p>"The only danger comes from Ralph. Once he's safe on the boat,
we've nothing more to fear. Be off and leave me."</p>

<p>She opened the window. They passed through it with their burden
and disappeared in the darkness.</p>

<p>She closed the shutters and shut the window.</p>

<p>A few minutes passed and the church clock struck. She counted
the strokes&mdash;eleven. At the eleventh stroke she went to the
door of the lodge, opened it, and listened. There came a low
whistle. She answered it by stamping on the tiles of the hall.</p>

<p>Dominique came hurrying to her. They went into the bedroom.</p>

<p>On the instant, without waiting for her to ask the question, he
said: "I've done it."</p>

<p>"Oh," she said in a shaky voice; and she was so upset that she
tottered and sank into a chair.</p>

<p>They stared at one another in silence.</p>

<p>Then Dominique uttered: "She felt nothing."</p>

<p>"She felt nothing?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"No. She was asleep."</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that&mdash;that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That she's dead? You may take your oath to it I am! I drove the
knife into her heart&mdash;three times. Besides I had the nerve to
wait to make sure. There was no need. She had stopped breathing and
her hands were cold."</p>

<p>"Suppose they were to discover it?"</p>

<p>"It's impossible. No one goes into her bedroom except in the
morning. Till then&mdash;they won't see."</p>

<p>They did not dare to look one another in the face. Dominique
held out his hand. She drew from her bosom ten thousand-franc notes
and held them out to him.</p>

<p>He almost snatched them from her and said: "Thanks. If it were
to be done again, I should refuse. What am I to do now?"</p>

<p>"Get away. If you run, you'll catch the others up before they
get back to the boat."</p>

<p>"They've got Ralph d'Andresy?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"That's a good thing. He's been giving me a lot of trouble
during the last fortnight. He was very suspicious. By the
way&mdash;those jewels of the monks."</p>

<p>"We have them," said Josephine.</p>

<p>"Are they safe?"</p>

<p>"In the strongroom of a bank in London."</p>

<p>"Are there many of them?" he said greedily.</p>

<p>"A trunk full."</p>

<p>"Good! More than a hundred thousand francs for me, what?"</p>

<p>"Much more. But hurry up&mdash;unless you prefer to wait for
me," she said.</p>

<p>"No, no. I want to get away from here as soon as possible and as
far as possible. But what about you?"</p>

<p>"I'm just going to make sure that there are no papers here which
would be dangerous for us, and I'll catch up with you."</p>

<p>Dominique followed the others out through the window. At once
Josephine ransacked all the drawers in the room, and finding
nothing, hunted through the pockets of Ralph's clothes.</p>

<p>She emptied his pocketbook out on to the table. It contained
bank notes, visiting cards and a photograph&mdash;the photograph of
Clarice d'Etigues.</p>

<p>Josephine looked at it earnestly with an expression no longer of
hate, but cold and unforgiving. Then she stood still wearing the
air of one who gazed upon some painful spectacle, while her lips
retained their sweet smile.</p>

<p>The mirror on the toilet table was in front of her and she
caught sight of her image in it. She sat down with her head resting
on her hands and gazed at herself. Her eyes grew brighter and her
smile sweeter, as if she was enjoying to the full her consciousness
of her beauty. She drew forward on to her forehead the thin veil
which always covered her hair and arranged it to bring out her
resemblance to the Virgin of Bernardino Luini.</p>

<p>She looked at herself for a minute or two, then seemed to
relapse into her painful reverie. The village clock chimed the
quarter past the hour; but still she did not stir. You would almost
have said that she was asleep, asleep with her eyes open,
unwinking. Presently, however, her eyes grew less vague, as they
gazed fixedly at something in the mirror over her shoulder. Just as
it sometimes happens in a dream that one's ideas, thronging and
incoherent, crystallize into one idea more and more precise, into
an image more and more clear, so it happened to her now. What was
that disconcerting image that she seemed to perceive, to which she
tried vainly to grow used? It was in the alcove in which the bed
was set, the walls of which were hung all round with curtains.
Between those curtains and the wall there must have been a space,
for one would have said that a hand was moving them.</p>

<p>Then a hand actually appeared, then an arm, then, above the arm,
a head.</p>

<p>Josephine, accustomed to spiritist séances in which phantoms
were materialized, gave a name to this spirit which her terrified
imagination had summoned from the shadows. It was clothed in white;
she could not be sure whether its lips were wreathed with an
affectionate smile, or drawn back in an angry snarl.</p>

<p>She stammered: "Ralph&mdash;Ralph&mdash;what do you want of
me?"</p>

<p>The phantom parted the curtains and came round the bed.
Josephine shut her eyes with a groan, then opened them again. The
hallucination was still there; and the phantom drew nearer with
movements which moved a chair and made a noise. She wished to fly,
but could not. Then she felt on her shoulder the grip of a hand
which was certainly not that of a spirit; and a cheerful voice
said:</p>

<p>"My dear Josephine, I should really advise you to get Prince
Lavosneff to take you for a short, restful cruise. You need one, my
dear Josephine. What? You take me for a ghost, me, Ralph d'Andresy!
I may be in pants and a nightshirt, nevertheless you ought to know
me."</p>

<p>He began to put on his clothes quickly. She stared at him and
muttered: "You? You?"</p>

<p>"Goodness, yes: me."</p>

<p>He laughed gently at her frowning face and went on in a jeering
tone. "Now, don't go pitching into Prince Lavosneff under the
impression that he has let me escape again. He has not. What he and
his friends carried away was simply a dummy stuffed with bran,
rolled up in my blankets and mattress. As for me, I did not stir
from the shelter in which I took refuge as soon as you left your
post on the other side of the shutters."</p>

<p>Josephine remained inert and as incapable of taking action as if
she had been beaten to a jelly.</p>

<p>"Hang it! You don't seem to be quite yourself," he went on, in
the same jeering tone. "Would you like a little glass of liquor to
buck you up? I quite understand that you're very much upset and I
admit that I should not like to be in your place&mdash;all your
little play fellows gone&mdash;no help possible for quite a
while&mdash;securely shut up in this room with a gentleman named
Ralph. It certainly is not a time to see the world in rose-color.
Unlucky Josephine. What a mess you have made of it!"</p>

<p>He stooped down and picked up the photograph of Clarice: "How
pretty my fiancée is, isn't she? It gave me the greatest pleasure
to see how you were admiring her just now. You know that we're
going to get married in a few days?"</p>

<p>"She's dead," said Josephine.</p>

<p>"As a matter of fact, I heard about that," he said calmly. "Your
little friend who was here just now stabbed her in her bed, didn't
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"With a dagger, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Three times&mdash;through the heart," she said.</p>

<p>"Once ought to have been enough, you know," he suggested.</p>

<p>She said slowly, as if striving to assure herself of the fact:
"She's dead. She's dead."</p>

<p>He chuckled: "What can you expect? It happens everyday. But you
can't expect me to change all my plans for a little thing like
that. Dead or alive, I'm going to marry her. And we must manage as
best we can. <i>You</i> managed splendidly."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Josephine sharply, beginning to grow
yet more uneasy at his careless bantering tone.</p>

<p>"What do I mean? Why look at you. First of all the Baron drowned
you, next you were blown up and then drowned in the wreck of your
vessel the <i>Glow-worm</i>. But all that drowning doesn't prevent
you from being here. Therefore the fact that Clarice has been
stabbed through the heart three times is no reason for my not
marrying her. Besides are you quite sure that your statement is
accurate?"</p>

<p>"One of my own men stabbed her," she said.</p>

<p>"Or at any rate he told you that he'd stabbed her."</p>

<p>"Why should he have lied?"</p>

<p>"Why, to get hold of the ten banknotes you handed over to
him."</p>

<p>"Dominique is incapable of betraying me! He would not betray me
for a hundred thousand francs! Besides he knows quite well that I
can lay hands on him. He's waiting for me with the others," she
said fiercely.</p>

<p>"Are you quite sure that he's waiting for you, Josine?" said
Ralph; and the jeering note in his voice was louder.</p>

<p>She shivered. She had a feeling that she was struggling in a
narrowing circle.</p>

<p>He shook his head and said thoughtfully: "It's odd, the blunders
we've made, you and I, with regard to one another. You must be
uncommonly simple to think that the blowing up of the
<i>Glow-worm</i>, the Pellegrini-Cagliostro shipwreck, and the
rubbish related by Prince Lavosneff took me in for an instant. How
on earth did you fail to guess that a fellow who is not an imbecile
to begin with, and has had the advantage of a course at your
school&mdash;and what a school!&mdash;would read your game as
easily as he would an open Bible? That shipwreck was really much
too convenient. One is accused of dozens of crimes, one's hands are
red with blood, the police are hunting one hard. Then one blows up
an old vessel; and all the past, the crimes, the stolen treasure,
the wealth of the monks, all sink in a lump along with it. One
passes for dead. One grows a new skin. And then one begins again, a
little further off, under another name, to murder, to torture, and
to bathe one's hands in blood. That may take in other people, old
girl, but not me. When I read about your shipwreck, I said 'It's
time to keep one's eyes open wide,' and I came here."</p>

<p>He paused, smiling at her, a chilling smile; then went on: "But
hang it all, Josephine, your visit was inevitable! And it was
inevitable that you must clear the way for it by the help of some
confederate. It was inevitable that the yacht of Prince Lavosneff
should come cruising off this coast one night. It was inevitable
that you must climb the staircase in the cliff which you had once
descended on a stretcher. Well, I took my precautions; and my first
care was to look about to see if there wasn't somebody I knew in
the neighborhood. A confederate, it's the very first step in the
art. And at once I recognized our young friend Dominique, since I
had happened to see him, a detail of which you were ignorant, on
the box of your carriage waiting at the door of Bridget Rousselin.
Dominique is a faithful servant; but the fear of the police and a
sound thrashing softened him to such a degree that he transferred
all his faithfulness to me; and he gave proof of it by sending you
false reports and by digging for your feet, in concert with me, the
pitfall into which you have stumbled. As for his reward: why, there
are the ten banknotes, out of <i>your</i> pocket, which you will
never see again, for your faithful servant has gone back to the
château and is under my protection. That's how we stand, my dear
Josephine. I might indeed have spared you this little comedy and
welcomed you here openly, for the mere pleasure of shaking you by
the hand. But I wished to see how you would direct the operation,
remaining myself in the background, and above all I wished to see
how you would receive the news of the supposed murder of Clarice
d'Etigues."</p>

<p>Josephine shrank away from him. He was no longer joking; bending
over her he said quietly: "Just a trace of feeling&mdash;just a
slightest trace&mdash;that was all you showed. You believed that
the child was dead, dead by your order; and it did not move you at
all. With you the death of others does not count. One is twenty,
with all one's life before one...with charm and beauty...You crush
all that, as if you were cracking a nut. Your conscience does not
make one protest. It is true that you do not laugh; but none the
more do you weep. In reality you do not give it a thought. I
remember that Beaumagnan called you a daughter of Hell&mdash;a
designation that revolted me. Now I see that he was right. Hell is
in you. You are a kind of monster about whom I can never think
again without horror. But what about you, Josephine? Aren't there
times when you feel that horror yourself?"</p>

<p>Still sitting at the toilet table, her head resting on her
hands, in the attitude of which she was so fond, she did not stir.
Ralph's pitiless words did not provoke that access of indignation
and fury for which he was looking. He felt that she was at one of
those moments in life at which one sees into the deepest depths of
one's soul and cannot turn one's eyes from the sight.</p>

<p>He was not greatly surprised. Without being frequent, such
moments could not be very uncommon in the life of this unbalanced
creature, whose nature, impassible on the surface, was now and
again ravaged by nervous convulsions in its depths. Matters were
turning out so different from what she had expected, and the
apparition of Ralph was so disconcerting that she was unable to
rise to struggle with the enemy who was so cruelly outraging
her.</p>

<p>He took advantage of her weakness, and went on in a voice that
demanded an answer: "Isn't it a fact, Josine, that at times you
terrify yourself? Aren't there times when you are full of horror at
yourself?"</p>

<p>The distress of Josephine was so profound that she murmured:
"Yes&mdash;yes sometimes. But you're not to speak to me about it. I
don't <i>want</i> to know. Be quiet&mdash;be quiet!"</p>

<p>"But on the contrary, it is necessary that you should know,"
said Ralph. "If such acts fill you with horror, why do you commit
them?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," she said faintly in an extreme lassitude.</p>

<p>"You do try then?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I try&mdash;I struggle&mdash;but it is never any use. I
was taught evil. I do evil as other people do good. I do evil just
as I breathe. That was what they willed."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"My mother," she muttered in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Your mother? The spy? The woman who made up all this Cagliostro
story?"</p>

<p>"Yes. But you're not to blame her. She was very fond of me. Only
she had not succeeded...She had become poor and wretched and she
wished me to succeed...and grow rich."</p>

<p>"Yet you were beautiful. And for a woman beauty is riches.
Beauty is enough."</p>

<p>"My mother was beautiful too; and yet her beauty was of no use
to her," she retorted.</p>

<p>"You were like her?"</p>

<p>"You could not tell one from the other. And that was my ruin.
She wished to carry out through me her great
idea&mdash;Cagliostro's legacy."</p>

<p>"And had she documents?"</p>

<p>"A scrap of paper...the list of the four enigmas. One of her
friends had found it in an old book; and it really seemed to be in
Cagliostro's handwriting. She was intoxicated by it and by her
success with the Empress Eugenie, from whom she got most of her
information. So I had to carry on the work. She put that into my
head when I was quite a child. My brain was trained to hold only
that idea. That was to be my livelihood&mdash;my destiny. I was the
daughter of Cagliostro. I was to take up the life she had led, the
life he had led a life as brilliant as he leads in the romances in
which he figures&mdash;the life of an adventuress, adored by
everyone and dominating the world. No scruples&mdash;no conscience.
I was to take vengeance for all that she had suffered. On her
deathbed her last words to me were 'Avenge me.'"</p>

<p>Ralph reflected. Then he said: "But your crimes&mdash;this lust
to kill?"</p>

<p>He could not catch her answer, and again he did not catch it
when he said: "Your mother was not the only person to bring you up
and equip you for evil. Who was your father?"</p>

<p>He fancied he caught the name of Leonard. But did she mean that
Leonard was her father, the man who had been expelled from France
in the days of the second empire&mdash;it was likely
enough&mdash;or that Leonard had trained her in crime?</p>

<p>He learned no more. He had loved her; and he had not the heart
to force his way into those obscure regions in which evil instincts
come to birth and are fostered, in which ferments everything that
unbalances, ruins, and disintegrates, all the vices, the vanities,
and bloodthirsty appetites, all the cruel and inexorable passions
which escape from our control. He asked no more.</p>

<p>Weeping silently, she caught his hands; and he was weak enough
to abandon them to her. He felt her kisses and her tears rain on
them. Insensibly pity filled his heart. The evil creature became a
human being, a woman delivered over to a diseased instinct, the
victim of the law of irresistible forces, one whom he ought perhaps
to regard with at least a little indulgence.</p>

<p>"Do not drive me from you," she said. "You are the only being in
the world who might have saved me from evil. I felt it at once.
There is something so sane and healthy about you. Love is the only
thing that has ever appeased me; and I have never loved anyone but
you. So if you cast me off&mdash;"</p>

<p>Her lips filled Ralph with an infinite languor. Pleasure and
desire embellished that dangerous compassion which weakens the
wills of men. And perhaps if Josephine had contented herself with
that humble caress, he might have succumbed of himself to the
temptation to bend down and once again taste the savor of those
lips which offered themselves to him. But she raised her head,
slipped her arms round his neck, and gazed into his eyes. And that
gaze sufficed to enable him to see in her no longer the woman who
implored, but the woman who desired to seduce and was employing the
tenderness of her eyes and the enchantment of her lips to that
end.</p>

<p>Looks link lovers. But Ralph knew so well what lay behind that
charming, ingenuous, and dolorous expression. The clearness of the
mirror did not redeem all the ugliness and ignominy which he saw so
plainly in it. Little by little he recovered. He withdrew from
temptation and releasing himself from the siren who enlaced him he
said:</p>

<p>"Do you remember, one day on the barge, that we feared one
another, as if we were trying to strangle one another? It is the
same today. If I fall again into your arms, I am lost.
Tomorrow&mdash;the day after, it would be death."</p>

<p>She drew herself up of a sudden hostile and dangerous. Once more
pride took possession of her and the storm once more rose suddenly,
causing them to pass without any transition from the kind of torpor
in which the memory of their love lulled them, to a bitter
constraint of enmity and hatred.</p>

<p>"Yes," Ralph went on. "At the bottom of our hearts, from the
very first day, we have been ferocious enemies. Neither of us
thought of anything but the defeat of the other. Especially you! I
was the rival and intruder. In your brain my image was mixed with
the idea of death. Voluntarily or not, you condemned me."</p>

<p>She shook her head and said in an aggressive tone: "Not till
now."</p>

<p>"But now you have, haven't you? Only a new fact presents itself;
and that is that <i>now</i> I can laugh at you, Josephine! The
pupil has become the master; and that was what I wished to
demonstrate to you by letting you come here and accepting the
battle. I offered myself, alone, to your attack and to the attack
of your gang. And now that we are face to face with one another,
you can do nothing to me. Defeat all along the line. What? Clarice
alive. Myself free. Come, my dear: clear out of my life. You are
hopelessly beaten; and I have a contempt for you."</p>

<p>He flung these insults at her like the blows of a scourge which
scarred her. She was deathly pale; her face was distorted; and for
the first time her unchangeable beauty showed signs of withering
and decay.</p>

<p>"I shall avenge myself," she said between her clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>"Impossible!" said Ralph with a careless laugh. "I have cut your
claws. You're afraid of me. That is the real miracle I have worked
today: you are afraid of me."</p>

<p>"I'll devote my whole life to avenging myself," she muttered,
scowling at him.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," he said confidently. "I know all your tricks.
You have failed. It's all over."</p>

<p>She shook her head and said fiercely: "I have other means."</p>

<p>"What are they?" he asked contemptuously.</p>

<p>"That incalculable fortune&mdash;those riches I have won."</p>

<p>"Thanks to whom?" he said lightly. "If ever there was a spark of
real intelligence in that strange adventure, didn't I supply
it?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But it was I who knew how to act and to take. And
that's everything. As far as words went, you were never at a loss
for them. But what was wanted was deeds; and those deeds I did.
Because Clarice is alive and you are free, you shout: 'Victory!'
But Clarice's life and your liberty are but little things beside
the great thing which was the stake for which we fought. That is to
say the thousands and thousands of precious stones. The real battle
was there; and I won it, for the treasure is mine."</p>

<p>"Can one ever be quite sure?" said Ralph in a mocking tone.</p>

<p>"Yes: the treasure is mine. With my own hands I heaped the
countless stones into a portmanteau, which was fastened and sealed
before my eyes, which I carried to Havre, which I hid in the bottom
of the hold of the <i>Glow-worm</i>, and took away before I blew
the vessel up. It is now in London in the strongroom of a bank,
tied up and sealed as it was at the beginning."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," agreed Ralph readily. "The rope is unbroken, still
tight in its place. There are five seals, the sealing-wax is
violet, with the initials J. B.&mdash;Josephine Balsamo&mdash;on
them. As for the trunk it's of plaited wickerwork, with leather
straps and handles&mdash;one of those simple things which attract
no one's attention&mdash;"</p>

<p>Josephine stared at him with frightened eyes and said: "You
know?...How do you know?"</p>

<p>"We spent a few hours together, I and that trunk," he said,
laughing.</p>

<p>"Lies!" she cried. "You're talking at random. The portmanteau
did not leave me for a second between the meadow of
Mesnil-sous-Jumièges and the strongroom in London."</p>

<p>"Yes it did, since you let it down into the hold of the
<i>Glow-worm</i>."</p>

<p>"I sat on the iron hatch which closed the hold and one of my men
kept watch over the port through which you might have entered it,
all the time we were in the roadstead at Havre," she declared.</p>

<p>"I know that."</p>

<p>"How can you know it?"</p>

<p>"I was in the hold."</p>

<p>It was an alarming sentence! He repeated it and then, thoroughly
enjoying his narrative he said to the stupefied Josephine: "In the
face of the shattered block this was my reasoning: 'If I hunt for
my good Josephine, I shall not find her. What I've got to do is to
guess the place where she will be at the end of the day, to get
there before her, to be there when she arrives, and to avail myself
of the first opportunity of scooping up the precious stones. For,
with the police on your trail, hunted by me, eager to get the
treasure into a safe place, it was inevitable that you must take to
flight, that is to say, get away abroad. How? Why, by means of your
vessel, the <i>Glow-worm</i>.</p>

<p>"At noon I was at Havre; at one o'clock the three members of the
crew who were on board went off, to drink their coffee at a bar. I
slipped across the gang way into the hold and hid myself behind a
heap of cases, barrels, and sacks of provisions. At six o'clock you
arrived and let the portmanteau down by a rope, so putting it under
my protection."</p>

<p>"You lie! You lie!" stuttered Josephine in a furious voice.</p>

<p>He went quietly on: "At ten o'clock Leonard joined you. He had
read the evening papers and learned about Beaumagnan's suicide. At
eleven o'clock you weighed anchor. At midnight, out at sea, a yacht
met you. Leonard, who became Prince Lavosneff, presided over the
disembarkation. The crew and the packages containing everything of
value were transferred from the deck of one vessel to the deck of
the other, in especial the portmanteau which you hauled up from the
bottom of the hold. And then to hell with the <i>Glow-worm</i>!</p>

<p>"I must admit that I spent some devilishly unpleasant minutes. I
was alone. There was no longer any crew or helmsmen. The
<i>Glow-worm</i> seemed to be steered by a drunken man, holding
himself up by her wheel. One would have said that she was a child's
toy which has been wound up and which goes round and round. And
then I guessed your plan&mdash;the bomb in one of the cabins, the
mechanism exploded it, the explosion.</p>

<p>"I was perspiring freely, I can tell you. Was I to throw myself
into the sea? I had just made up my mind to do so, when, as I was
untying my shoelaces, I nearly fainted with joy at the sight of a
dinghy in the wake of the <i>Glow-worm</i> fastened to her by a
rope. It was my salvation. Ten minutes later sitting quietly in it,
I saw a flame leap up in the darkness about three hundred yards
away, and heard a roar roll across the sea like a peal of thunder.
The <i>Glow-worm</i> had blown up.</p>

<p>"The next night, after having been tossed about a bit, I came in
sight of shore not far from Cape Antifer. I slipped into the water
and swam to it, and that very day I came here&mdash;to get
everything ready for your visit, my dear Josephine."</p>

<p>She had listened to him without interrupting with an air of
serenity. She had the air of saying: "Words again&mdash;nothing but
words." The essential thing was the portmanteau. Supposing that he
had hidden himself on the vessel and afterwards escaped shipwreck.
It was of no importance.</p>

<p>She hesitated however to ask a definite question. She knew very
well that Ralph was not the kind of man to risk everything to
obtain no other result than to save himself. She was very pale.</p>

<p>"Well, haven't you any questions to ask me?" he said.</p>

<p>"What questions? You said yourself that I had taken the
portmanteau. And afterwards I put it in a safe place."</p>

<p>"And you didn't make sure that it was all right?"</p>

<p>"Gracious, no. What was the point in opening it? The ropes and
seals were intact."</p>

<p>"You didn't notice the mark of a hole in the side&mdash;an
opening made between the strands of wickerwork?"</p>

<p>"An opening?" she said faintly.</p>

<p>"Goodness, you don't suppose that I spent two hours with a
portmanteau full of jewels without doing anything? Come: I'm not
such a fool as that."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;then&mdash;" she said in a yet fainter voice.</p>

<p>"Then, my poor friend, little by little, patiently, I extracted
all the contents of the portmanteau with the result
that&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With the result that?"</p>

<p>"&mdash;when you open it you will find nothing inside but a
roughly equivalent weight of trifles of no great value&mdash;just
what I had to hand, finding them in the sacks of provisions&mdash;a
good many pounds of lentils and haricot beans&mdash;merchandise for
which it is hardly worth your while perhaps, to pay the rent of a
strongroom in a London bank."</p>

<p>She struggled not to believe him and protested: "It isn't true!
You can't have been able&mdash;" Her voice died away before this
paralyzing revelation.</p>

<p>He reached up to a shelf and took down a little wooden bowl,
from which he poured into the palm of his hand two or three dozen
diamonds and rubies and sapphires and carelessly made them dance
and sparkle and clink.</p>

<p>"And there are others," he said with an air of satisfaction.
"Undoubtedly the imminence of the explosion prevented me from
bringing the lot of them away; and the bulk of the treasure of the
monks is scattered about the bottom of the sea. But all the same
there's something to amuse a young man and help him to bear up.
What do you think, Josine? You don't answer...But hang it all!
What's the matter now, confound it? You're never going to faint!
Oh, these infernal women! They can't even lose a thousand millions
without going off. What milksops they are!"</p>

<p>Josephine did not "go off," as Ralph had phrased it. She drew
herself up, livid with raised arms. She wished to insult him. She
wished to strike him. But she was suffocating. Her hands beat the
air like the hands of a drowning man waving above the surface of
the sea; and she fell upon the bed, moaning hoarsely.</p>

<p>Unmoved, he waited for the end of the attack. But he had still
something to say to her.</p>

<p>"Well, have I beaten you? Have madam's shoulders touched the
mat? Are you knocked out? Defeat all along the line. What? That's
what I wanted to bring home to you, Josephine. You will go away
from here completely convinced that you can do nothing against me
and that it is best to give up all idea of plotting against me. I
shall be happy in spite of you, and so will Clarice, and we shall
have lots and lots of children. So you will have to make up your
mind to face these facts."</p>

<p>He began to walk up and down and went on in accents that grew
more and more cheerful: "Moreover what would you? You struck a
streak of bad luck when you went to war with a stout young fellow
who is ten times as strong and smart as you, my poor girl. I'm
often astonished myself at my strength and smartness. Heavens! What
a marvel of cleverness, cunning, intuition, energy, and
clearsightedness! A veritable genius! Nothing escapes me. I read
the minds of my enemies like an open book. Their slightest thoughts
are known to me. So, at this very moment you've got your back to
me, haven't you? You're spread out on the bed and I cannot see your
charming face. All the same I'm perfectly well aware that you're
slipping your hand into your bodice and pulling out a revolver and
that you're going&mdash;"</p>

<p>The sentence was not finished. Suddenly Josephine twisted round,
revolver in hand.</p>

<p>The report rang out. But Ralph, who was ready had time to grasp
her wrist and twist it back&mdash;towards herself. She fell back
wounded in the bosom.</p>

<p>The scene had been so brutal and the dénouement so unexpected
that he stood speechless before this suddenly inert form which lay
before him, the face colorless.</p>

<p>However he felt no anxiety. He did not believe that she was
dead; and as a matter of fact, when he bent down and looked into
it, he found that her heart was beating steadily. He cut away the
top of her bodice with his nail-scissors. The bullet, striking
aslant, had glanced off after ploughing through the flesh, a little
above the black mark on top of her breast.</p>

<p>"It isn't a serious wound," he said to himself, thinking that
the death of such a creature would have been only right and
desirable.</p>

<p>He stood over her, still holding the scissors in his hand, and
asking himself if it was not his duty to destroy this too perfect
beauty, to mangle that charming face and so to rob the siren of her
power to injure. A scar in the shape of a deep cross across her
face, which raised ridges of skin would render indelible, what a
just punishment and what a valuable precaution! What evil deeds
avoided and what crimes prevented!</p>

<p>He had not the courage to do so; he did not wish to arrogate to
himself the right to do so. Besides he had loved her too well.</p>

<p>He stood for a long time motionless, gazing down at her with
infinite sadness. The struggle had exhausted him. He found himself
full of bitterness and disgust. She was his first love, his first
real love, and that passion to which the innocent heart brings so
much freshness and of which it retains so sweet a memory, had
brought him in the end nothing but rancor and hate. All his life
his lips would retain a slight curl of disenchantment and his soul
the impression of a scar.</p>

<p>She breathed more easily and opened her eyes.</p>

<p>At once he felt an irresistible urge never to see her again,
never even to think of her.</p>

<p>Opening the window, he listened. He fancied that he heard
hurrying steps from the direction of the shore. Leonard must have
discovered, on reaching the beach, that all the fruits of the
expedition had been the capture of a dummy, and doubtless, anxious
about Josephine, he was returning to help her.</p>

<p>"Let him find her here; let him carry her away!" he said to
himself. "Let her die or let her live! Let her be happy or unhappy!
I don't care a rap. I don't want to hear anything more about her.
Enough of this hell!"</p>

<p>And without a word, without a glance at the woman who held out
her hands and implored him not to leave her, he went away.</p>

<p>Next morning he paid a visit to Clarice. In order not to reopen
wounds which he knew must be so very painful, he had not yet seen
her again. But she had known that he was there; and at once he
perceived that time had already done its work. A warmer color
mantled her cheeks; her eyes were shining with hope.</p>

<p>"Clarice," he said to her, "from the very first day you promised
to forgive me everything."</p>

<p>"I have nothing to forgive you, Ralph," she said, with the
remembrance of her father's crimes in her mind.</p>

<p>"Yes you have, Clarice. I have hurt you cruelly," he protested.
"I have hurt myself very little less; and it is not only your love
that I ask but also your care and your protection. I need you to
help me to forget horrible memories, to restore my confidence in
life, and to combat many ugly qualities in me which urge me to a
path I do not wish to tread. With your help I am sure I can be
honest; I am certainly going to try hard. And I promise you that
you shall be happy. Will you be my wife?"</p>

<p>She held out her hand.</p>

<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>15. Epilogue</h2>

<p>As Ralph had supposed all the vast network of intrigue woven to
acquire the legendary treasure was never brought to the light of
day. The suicide of Beaumagnan; the crimes of Madam Pellegrini, the
mysterious personality of the Countess of Cagliostro, her flight,
the shipwreck of the <i>Glow-worm</i>, all these diverse facts,
Justice could not, or would not, link together. The memorandum of
the Cardinal Bishop was destroyed, or disappeared. The associates
of Beaumagnan disbanded and did not speak. The world knew
nothing.</p>

<p>Necessarily the part that Ralph had played in the affair could
not even be suspected; and his marriage passed unnoticed. By what
miracle did he succeed in marrying under the name of the Vicomte
d'Andresy? Doubtless one must attribute this exploit to the
formidable means of action afforded him by the two or three
handfuls of precious stones saved from the treasure. With those
means one can get many things winked at.</p>

<p>And it was by those means evidently that one day the name of
Lupin was found to have vanished. On no register and on no
documents was there any longer any trace of Arsène Lupin, or of his
father, Theophrastus Lupin. Legally there was only the Vicomte
Ralph d'Andresy; and that Vicomte went on his travels through
Europe with the Vicomtesse, née Clarice d'Etigues.</p>

<p>In the course of their travels news came to them of the death of
the Baron d'Etigues. He perished, along with his cousin Oscar de
Bennetot, while they were out rowing. Was it an accident? Was it
suicide? During the last days of their lives the two cousins had
been reckoned mad; and it was generally agreed that they had
committed suicide. But there was also another version which hinted
at crime. There were people who declared that a yacht had run down
the boat and disappeared. But of this there was no proof.</p>

<p>Whatever the facts might be, Clarice would not touch her
father's fortune. She divided it among charitable institutions.</p>

<p>The years rolled on, delightful and careless years. Ralph kept
one of the promises which he had made to Clarice: she was
profoundly happy. The other promise he did not keep: he was not
honest.</p>

<p>Honesty seemed to be beyond his power. He had in his blood the
need to take, to scheme, to mystify, to dupe, to amuse himself at
other people's expense. He was by instinct smuggler, filibuster,
marauder, pirate, plotter, and above all chief of a gang. Besides,
in the school of Josephine, he had discovered, not without pride,
really exceptional qualities in himself which rendered him
practically without peer. He believed in his genius. He conferred
on himself the right to a fantastic destiny, and one contrary to
the destiny of all the men who were his contemporaries. He would be
above all of them. He would be the master.</p>

<p>Without the knowledge of Clarice then, without indeed the young
woman's having the least suspicion of it, he carried on enterprises
and brought to success affairs in which his authority grew stronger
and stronger and his really superhuman gifts developed.*</p>

<p class="footnote">[* The acquisition of the treasure of the Kings
of France, the second enigma of Cagliostro, and the discovery of
that impenetrable retreat from which, fifteen years later, he could
only be dislodged by the help of a flotilla of torpedo-boats, dates
from this epoch.]</p>

<p>But before everything he told himself, the repose and happiness
of Clarice! He respected his wife. That she should be, and that she
should know herself to be the wife of a thief, that he could not
allow.</p>

<p>Their happiness lasted five years; at the beginning of the sixth
year Clarice died in giving birth to a son called Jean.</p>

<p>The very day after her death that son disappeared, without the
slightest clue which allowed Ralph to discover who had entered the
little house at Auteuil in which he lived or how they had been able
to enter it.</p>

<p>As for the matter of guessing whose hand had struck the blow,
there was no need to hesitate about that. Ralph, who had never
doubted that the drowning of the two cousins had been brought about
by the Countess of Cagliostro, Ralph, who yet later had learned
that Dominique had died of poison, Ralph regarded it as settled
that the Countess of Cagliostro was the author of the abduction.
His grief transformed him. Having no longer either wife or son to
restrain him, he flung himself with all his heart into the course
to which so many forces impelled him. From that day on he was
Arsène Lupin. There was no longer any reservation, any compromise.
On the contrary: scandals, challenges, arrogance, an unbridled
display of vanity and mockery, his name written on the walls, his
visiting card in strongrooms. Arsène Lupin, what!</p>

<p>But whether he was passing under this name or under any other of
the different names it pleased him to assume, whether he called
himself Count Bernard d'Andresy (he had stolen the papers of a
cousin of his family, who had died abroad) or Horace Velmont, or
Colonel Sparmiento, or the Duke of Charmerace, or Prince Sernine,
or Don Luis Perenna, always and everywhere, in all his avatars and
beneath all his masks, he hunted for the Countess of Cagliostro, he
hunted for his son Jean. He did not find his son. He never saw
Josephine again. Was she still alive? Did she dare to risk entering
France? Did she continue to persecute and to kill? Could he admit,
considering what she was, that the menace eternally held over him
since the very moment of their rupture would not take effect in
some vengeance yet more cruel than the abduction of his son?</p>

<p>All the life of Arsène Lupin, wild enterprises, superhuman
trials, unheard of triumphs, unmeasured passions, extravagant
ambitions, all these had to run their course before events
permitted him to answer this formidable question.</p>

<p>And so it came about that his first adventure linked itself,
more than a quarter of a century later, to the adventure which it
pleases him to consider today his last.</p>
