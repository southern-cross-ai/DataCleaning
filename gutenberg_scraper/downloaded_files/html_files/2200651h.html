<p align="center"><em>By The Author Of &lsquo;Lady Audley&rsquo;s Secret,&rsquo;  Etc.</em></p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h3>
<p>His name was Reginald  Ravenscroft&mdash;rather a pretty name, as he used to say himself in a plaintive  manner, if any one would have been so good as to call him by it &mdash; but he had  been surnamed the Zoophyte by his brother officers in the Queen&rsquo;s Trumpeters,  of which favourite corps he had been captain &mdash;the Zoophyte, ordinarily  abbreviated for convenience into the Zoo.</p>
<p>This sobriquet had been  bestowed upon Captain Ravenscroft on account of a certain easiness&mdash; not to say  laziness&mdash;of disposition which formed the most salient feature in his character.  In all their experience of him&mdash;and he had been a member of that crack regiment  for some ten years&mdash;the Queen&rsquo;s Trumpeters had never seen Reginald Ravenscroft in  any other than that placid and lamblike condition which was his natural  temperament. He had had his trials in those years, of course &mdash; petty annoyances  and small vexations, insolent letters from tradesmen and attorneys, aggravating  blunders on the part of his body-servant, refusals to cash up from his  relatives &mdash; vexations which would have thrown other men into raging passions,  and sent them stamping about their quarters in a state of temporary lunacy; but  they had no more discomposing effect upon Captain Ravenscroft than if he had  indeed been one of those strange dabs of gelatinous matter which one sees  sticking to the rocks at low tide. He swore, it is true; indeed his <em>r&eacute;pertoire</em> of bad language was  considerably in advance of that of his fellows, being richly garnished with the  choicest flowers from Billingsgate and Seven-dials, and strengthened by some  very original blasphemies of his own composition; but the Queen&rsquo;s Trumpeters  declared it was the funniest thing in the world to hear him give utterance to a  lengthened string of blackguardisms which would have astonished any rough in  St. Giles&rsquo;s, in the smoothest mildest tones, and with a most perfect placidity  of face and manner. People were very fond of him, although, it must be freely  admitted, he had never been known to be of very much use to any of his fellow-creatures.  The idea of doing anyone a service never entered his sluggish brain; but on the  other hand, he never gave offence to any human being. So people liked him for  being good-tempered and agreeable, and freely forgave him his uselessness.</p>
<p>He was very handsome.  This fact may have had some influence upon the minds of his acquaintance, for  his good looks were of an eminently pleasing and conciliating type. He had a  nose that was almost straight enough for perfect Greek, a pale complexion &mdash; which  his female acquaintance called interesting, but which he himself described as  bilious&mdash; dreamy gray eyes with long black lashes and the most expressive  eyebrows, a low broad forehead crowned with crisply waving dark hair. There was  a want of strength and firmness about the mouth and chin; but a moustache  concealed the weakness of one feature, and a beard gave form and character to  the other; so, upon the whole, the Zoophyte was about as handsome a man as you  would be likely to see in any given day&rsquo;s journey.</p>


<p>He was by no means a fop:  but he was quite aware that he was good-looking, and would state the fact in a  business-like manner, in any discussion of his affairs and prospects. He  dressed well, of course; to belong to the Queen&rsquo;s Trumpeters and not to dress  well would have been an impossibility. The newest combinations of colour in  cravats, the last design in socks, the most novel devices in dress-shirts, were  scarcely fresh enough for the Trumpeters; while the amount to which every one  of these gentlemen became annually indebted to his tailor and his bootmaker  would have been a fair income for a moderate-sized family. The Trumpeters were  extravagant, and prided themselves on their extravagance.</p>
<p>From his earliest youth  upwards debt and difficulty had been, as it were, the normal condition of the  Zoophyte: difficulty for other people, that is to say; for his debts had never  been a cause of disturbance to himself. It was his habit to allow matters to go  on till they became utterly desperate, when he would coolly hand over to his  wealthy sister, Lady Talmash Brading, a tangled mass of correspondence from  tradesmen and attorneys, not one letter of which had ever been replied to, and  leave her and her solicitors to settle the business exactly as they pleased.</p>
<p>She was a very kind  sister, and had paid Reginald Ravenscroft&rsquo;s debts so often, that it had become  in a manner an established thing that she should pay them. He scarcely thanked  her. &lsquo;What the deuce has she to do with her money?&rsquo; he would say, when any one  lauded her generosity; &lsquo;she is so preposterously rich, that I consider I do her  an actual favour in relieving her of a little of her superfluous cash. It&rsquo;s  like a periodical blood-letting. She would be subject to a kind of financial  apoplexy, if it were not for me&mdash;would expire of a golden plethora.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There are limits,  however, to human patience, and Lady Talmash Brading was beginning to grow very  tired of her brother Reginald&rsquo;s periodical insolvencies&mdash;the tailors&rsquo; and  boot-makers&rsquo; and shirt-makers&rsquo; and perfumers&rsquo; bills; the heavy accounts from  elegant purveyors in St. James&rsquo;s street, who pleasantly combined the daily  necessities of stationery with the glittering temptations of the jeweller, so  that the idle swell, being smitten by the effect of some curious monogram on  his note-paper, might have it repeated in emeralds and diamonds, or ruby and  onyx, as the case may be, on his scarf-pin and shirt-studs, a locket or a pair  of sleeve-links; the fearful list of goods supplied by crack saddlers and spur-makers  &mdash; the endless catalogue of articles which had been necessary to the existence  of Captain Ravenscroft during two or three years of that gentleman&rsquo;s harmless  career. Lady Talmash Brading was beginning to grow weary of these things.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is always the same,  Reginald,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;or if there is any change, it is for the worse. I can&rsquo;t  comprehend it. You can&rsquo;t possibly be always wanting the same things &mdash;  watch-chains and rings and studs and pins. Those things don&rsquo;t wear out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear Leonora; but  a fellow loses them and gives them away, and so on. If a fellow one likes sees  a thing of that kind on one&rsquo;s dressing-table and takes a fancy to it, how can  one do less than offer it to him? Studs and breast-pins are the small change of  life, like four-penny-bits. And then they go out of fashion&mdash;they get known; you  couldn&rsquo;t expect a man to wear a thing he had had over a month. They say  Heliogabalus would as soon have thought of wearing his shoes twice as a ring &mdash; and  you wouldn&rsquo;t have an officer in the Queen&rsquo;s Own Trumpeters less particular than  a dirty Roman emperor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash Brading only  shrugged her shoulders impatiently in reply to this remonstrance. She was  walking up and down her splendid drawing-room in Grosvenor-square, while the  Zoophyte lounged at his ease in one satin-covered armchair, with his legs  stretched before him on another, and a <em>Morning  Post</em> spread out upon his knees. He had a glass stuck in one eye, through  which he lazily surveyed the impetuous movements of his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no common  patience,&rsquo; she exclaimed at last. &lsquo;If you took the least trouble to regulate  your affairs, one wouldn&rsquo;t mind so much; but you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you allow matters to go  on till they can go no farther, and then just fling a mass of bills over to me,  and expect me to pay them. I don&rsquo;t believe you even know what you owe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I confess, my dear  sister, that I have not even an approximate idea of the amount. But why  distress yourself upon the subject? the affair is such a mere bagatelle to you.  Why not hand the documents over to your steward, and dismiss the business from  your mind altogether?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is not my way of  doing things, Reginald,&rsquo; answered his sister severely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unhappily not, my dear  creature. You are so awfully business-like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you were a little  more business-like, a little more reasonable, Reginald, I should have some hope  of you. If you would only remember that my patience may be exhausted, and learn  to economise&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Economise in the Queen&rsquo;s  Trumpeters! Not to be done, my dear soul. I believe there was a man once in the  corps who tried to live within his income, and they did something dreadful to  him &mdash; filled his bed with some empty soda-water bottles with the wires on, or  tarred and feathered him, or tried him by court-martial, or told him he&rsquo;d  better sell out, or something ferocious in that way. No, Leonora, as long as I  remain a Trumpeter, I shall do my duty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I should think the  sooner you cease to be a Trumpeter, the better. If you mean always to go on as  you have been going on for the last ten years, the sooner you sell out the  better.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you really think so?&rsquo;  murmured the Zoophyte, staring at her reflectively through his glass. &lsquo;Well,  the question is open to consideration certainly. I should realise a couple of  thousand or so by the sale of my commission; and I never had two thousand  pounds of ready money in my life. Two thousand in actual bank-notes and gold! &mdash;  there must be a good deal, of spending in that.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed Lady  Talmash Brading. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that you would really be so mad as to leave  the army?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not? Weren&rsquo;t you  recommending it just now? I could live with you. You couldn&rsquo;t refuse shelter to  such a harmless fellow as me. I could stroll about the place all day when you  were down at Brading, keeping an eye upon the gardeners, and seeing they didn&rsquo;t  waste their time &mdash; I should be invaluable in that way. Or I might marry Miss  Corks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marry Miss Corks!&rsquo; cried  Lady Talmash Brading, with supreme disdain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you wouldn&rsquo;t like  a brewer&rsquo;s daughter to call you sister-in-law? But upon my word I might do a  worse thing for myself: she&rsquo;s a very nice girl &mdash; a pretty girl too &mdash; and will  have a hundred thousand for her fortune; and I think she&rsquo;d have me. I really  don&rsquo;t see why you should set your face against Miss Corks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;If you want to disgrace  me in the sight of all Brading by a match of that kind, pray do so; but from  the hour in which you do so, you may consider that you and I are strangers &mdash; I  would never speak to you again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hard lines, rather,  Leonora, when such a marriage would make my fortune. But under those  circumstances you can&rsquo;t of course object to pay my debts occasionally.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do object to pay them  ever again. I will allow you two hundred a year; and if you can&rsquo;t contrive to  live upon that and your pay, you must look elsewhere for assistance. It will be  no use appealing to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Leonora, this is  positively inhuman &mdash; that allusion to my pay is the very essence of mockery. As  if my pay had ever counted for anything! O, I see that I must marry Miss  Corks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do,&rsquo; said Lady Talmash  Brading, &lsquo;at your peril.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h3>
<p>She was a proud woman,  Lady Talmash Brading. She had begun life as an acknowledged beauty, and the  only daughter of a Somersetshire gentleman of small landed estate; so small  indeed, having dwindled down from the fair proportions of the past, that Leonora  Ravenscroft felt it incumbent upon her to make a good marriage. She had married  young, and she had been twice married &mdash; first to Mr. Prothero, the great  shipbuilder, a man of untold wealth; and then to Viscount Talmash Brading, of  Brading Park, Yorkshire, and Talmash Towers, Leicestershire &mdash; and she had been  twice a widow. She had more estates than she could count on the fingers of one  of her pretty plump hands; she had coal mines in the north, and a tin mine in  the west; she had the superbly appointed house in Grosvenor-square, furnished  by the lamented Prothero; the dainty little villa at Cowes, designed and built  by the never-too-much-to-be-regretted viscount; and to inherit all these things  she had only one daughter, a fair-haired girl of twelve, born to her a few days  before that fatal accident in the hunting field which caused the viscount&rsquo;s  death. Happily for the Zoophyte, this fair-haired young heiress, Julia Talmash  Brading, was very fond of her uncle Regy. Not that he had ever done anything to  deserve her affection. He existed &mdash; that was the highest form of exertion of  which this member of the coraline tribe was capable.</p>
<p>After that interview in  Grosvenor-square, &mdash; which might have been a stormy one, had it been any more  possible for one person to sustain the whole burden of a tempest, than it is  possible for one person to perform a duet, &mdash; Lady Talmasli Brading vowed a  terrible vow that she would never again pay her brother&rsquo;s debts. There were  limits to a sister&rsquo;s generosity, she said, and he had gone beyond them. It  would be a wrong done to her precious Julia, if she were to go on being imposed  upon in this manner. Granted that she was rich, the wealth of all the Lydian  kings, from Candaules downwards, would scarcely have been enough to stand  against such extravagance as Reginald Ravenscroft&rsquo;s. He was now clear of debt.  He was set on his pins once more, to use the homely language of my lady&rsquo;s  solicitor, and this last setting him on his pins had been a more expensive  business than usual. She would allow him two hundred a year &mdash; fifty pounds a  quarter, paid with unerring regularity &mdash; and she would do no more.</p>
<p>She kept her word. The  Queen&rsquo;s Own Trumpeters were ordered off to Ireland about this time, much to the  Zoophyte&rsquo;s aggravation. If that invertebrate creature could feel strongly upon  any point, that point was his attachment to the metropolis. To the profoundest  deeps of his nature he was a Cockney. Pall Mall and St. James&rsquo;s street, with a  rare excursus as far as Rotten Row, formed his world; and to be removed to  barbarous and unknown regions beyond the reach of this world was the greatest  hardship the Zoophyte had ever been called upon to endure. But even this trial  could not arouse him to loud lamentations or violent demonstration of any kind.  He was heard to utter faint moaning noises like the bleating of a distressed  lamb, he swore a little harder than usual in his meek voice, and indeed  invented one or two choice forms of execration under this unwonted pressure. He  neglected his diet, was seen to take his <em>potage  &agrave; l&rsquo; Italien</em> without grated Parmesan, and didn&rsquo;t grumble at the  non-appearance of those preliminary natives which he was wont to sacrifice to  the gods, as it were, before beginning his dinner. Greater things might have  befallen him unheeded in the anguish of this Hibernian exile.</p>
<p>They departed, however,  the Queen&rsquo;s Own Trumpeters, in all their supernal splendour, and the Zoophyte  had the comfort of knowing that he left the great city without leaving a  creditor behind him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s almost melancholy,&rsquo;  he said; &lsquo;if I were to die suddenly, who&rsquo;d be sorry for me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Trumpeters were in  Ireland for the greater part of a year, and were then transferred to a small  garrison town in Lancashire &mdash; rather a dreary place, where it might be supposed  almost impossible for any man to get into debt. The Zoophyte received his  quarterly allowance punctually, and accepted it meekly. He had never been known  to refuse money; but he accepted it under mental protest. He found the  quarterly remittance rather handy for the payment of his small losses at  billiards and whist; and on one occasion, his wandering fancies being caught by  a breastrpin exposed for sale in the chief jeweller&rsquo;s of the small garrison  town, he bought and paid for the bauble on the spot. It was about the only  transaction in his life in which he had ever employed ready-money, and he  informed his friends afterwards that it afforded him a novel sensation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I felt that it was low,&rsquo;  he said, &lsquo;decidedly low. I felt myself sunk considerably in the social scale, to  enter into a detail of that kind with a tradesman fellow, instead of paying him  through my lawyer, in a gentlemanly manner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>While the Zoophyte  endured his exile in Ireland and Lancashire, Lady Talmash Brading was for the  greater part of the time travelling in Switzerland and Italy with her &lsquo;precious  Julia.&rsquo; For nearly two years, therefore, she had heard very little of her  brother, who had a marked aversion to letter-writing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My sister&rsquo;s in Italy,  you see,&rsquo; he would remark plaintively, &lsquo;and people who are away from England  are so confoundedly selfish, they expect one to tell them such a lot in one&rsquo;s  letters &mdash; so I find the only plan is not to write at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The brother and sister  had not met since that morning in Grosvenor square when Leonora had vowed a vow  that she would never pay Reginald&rsquo;s debts again, when Lady Talmash Brading and  her daughter returned from the Continent, and came straight down to Brading  Park.</p>
<p>It was midsummer, and the  park and gardens were in all their June splendour: the hothouses full of ripe  purple grapes and rosy velvet-skinned peaches, ruddy nectarines and golden  apricots; the kitchen gardens running over with mellow-flavoured peas,  wonderful cucumbers, and late asparagus, to say nothing of two or three acres  of strawberry beds, where the fresh green leaves lay lightly on beds of tan or  straw, and where a weed would have been more difficult to find than the rarest  orchid in the Botanical Dictionary. The Zoophyte was fond of Brading Park, he  was especially fond of the kitchen gardens. He liked to stroll with Julia  through the hothouses in the drowsy noontide, stopping now and then to finger  the ponderous bunches of grapes with a thoughtful touch, anon to gaze dreamily  on a row of pines, or to pluck a peach that seemed ready to drop into his  mouth. He liked Brading Park &mdash; the house was a nice sleepy old place, with  capacious sofas and easy-chairs in every available corner; sunny nooks in deep  south-west windows, where a man might doze over his morning paper; and in all  the galleries and reception-rooms thick Axmmster carpets that muffled the sound  of passing footsteps. The Zoophyte liked Brading &mdash; he had his own particular  suite of rooms there, and free quarters. Of course his military engagements had  prevented his wearing out his welcome.</p>
<p>Brading seemed very rural  and homelike and pleasant to Lady Talmash Brading and her daughter after those  perpetual Italian hotels, with their gaudy gilded chambers, and eternal clocks  and candelabra. Julia skipped about the gardens in an ecstasy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think there have never  been such flowers or such fruit as there are this year, mamma,&rsquo; she exclaimed.  &lsquo;There&rsquo;s only one thing I want to make me quite happy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what is that, my  dearest love?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Uncle Regy. He would so  enjoy the peaches &mdash; you know how fond he is of peaches; and it is so nice to  see him eat them &mdash; peeling them so slowly and deliberately with those lazy  white hands of his.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think there is  much chance of your seeing your uncle,&rsquo; replied Lady Talmash Brading; &lsquo;I had  occasion to be very much displeased with him when last we met &mdash; we had some  words, in fact.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Had words, mamma? Do you  mean to say that uncle Regy could possibly quarrel with any one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no, I don&rsquo;t know  that Reginald said very much himself, but I said a great deal to him. I was in  a passion, Julia, and spoke my mind very freely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What had he been doing,  mamma?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, the usual thing &mdash; getting  over head and ears in debt, and then coolly flinging his embarrassments upon  me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The fair young heiress  scarcely seemed shocked at this. She only shook her head in a deprecating way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are so rich, mamma  dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we can afford to pay poor uncle Regy&rsquo;s debts now and then.  Military men always get into debt. Grandpapa ought not to have put him into  such an expensive regiment as the Queen&rsquo;s Trumpeters.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,  Julia, but it has been going on a great deal too long; and when last I saw your  uncle, I told him that I should never pay his debts again; upon which he had  the impertinence to threaten me that he would marry Miss Corks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, mamma! the  daughter of the fat brewer in Brading?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Julia; and there  would be a disgrace. Mr. Corks&rsquo; father was butler to my husband&rsquo;s grandfather,  and the son began business in the smallest way in the world. They say he&rsquo;s enormously  rich now, but a most ignorant vulgar person. He&rsquo;s very popular in Brading,  however, among a certain set, and I believe there are people who visit him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss Corks rides to  hounds, mamma &mdash; I&rsquo;ve seen her when we&rsquo;ve been to see them break covert &mdash; rather  a nice-looking girl, with wavy brown hair, and a rosy face. It&rsquo;s a pity she&rsquo;s  too common for uncle Regy to marry her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Too common &mdash; yes, I  should think so. The idea of the Corks tribe fastening on us!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But they are not a very  large tribe, mamma; Miss Corks is an only child, isn&rsquo;t she?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I believe so,&rsquo; Lady  Talmash answered coldly; &lsquo;but that doesn&rsquo;t make the least difference. The thing  is not to be heard of.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next day was  cloudless but sultry; not a breath stirred the roses on the lawn, or rippled  the blue bosom of the lake. Lady Talmash and her daughter sat in the garden  after luncheon, in a favourite spot under a mighty sycamore. They had work with  them and books, but neither of them worked or read. It was the laziest possible  weather.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just the sort of weather  that uncle Regy likes, mamma,&rsquo; said Julia, &lsquo;when he can lie on the grass and  bask. How he would enjoy Brading this delicious midsummer! I am so sorry to  think of him in a nasty dull town in Lancashire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had not any prolonged  cause for sorrow; for looking up at this very moment, she perceived the object  of her thoughts walking slowly across the lawn towards her, with the air of  having left the house half an hour or so before for an afternoon stroll. It was  the Zoophyte&rsquo;s celebrated manner, placid and imperturbable to the last degree.</p>
<p>My lady was fairly taken  aback by this apparition.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, Reginald,&rsquo; she  exclaimed, &lsquo;what in heaven&rsquo;s name brought you here?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The ten-o&rsquo;clock express  &mdash; leaves King&rsquo;s-cross at ten &mdash; a capital train. How d&rsquo;ye do, Leonora? &mdash; how  d&rsquo;ye do, July? What a handsome girl you&rsquo;re growing! You take after your unfortunate  uncle, you see, and not the Talmash Bradings. Your father might give you rank,  my love, but he couldn&rsquo;t give you beauty. How sweet the old place looks &mdash; such  a warm sleepiness about it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte dropped  himself into one of the garden arm-chairs, and stretched out his legs with a  complacent air. There was dust upon his boots. He had actually walked half a  mile or so.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I find myself getting  fat,&rsquo; he said, in explanation of this unusual circumstance; &lsquo;so whenever I have  an opportunity, I go in for violent exercise. I&rsquo;ve walked from the station.  I&rsquo;ve got some luggage and that kind of thing there &mdash; perhaps you&rsquo;ll be good  enough to send a trap for it. How are the grapes this year, July?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Julia,&rsquo; said her mother  rather stiffly, &lsquo;go and tell one of the grooms to fetch your uncle&rsquo;s  portmanteau.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, my dear Leonora, it  isn&rsquo;t a portmanteau, it&rsquo;s luggage &mdash; large military cases and that kind of  thing. You&rsquo;d better send the biggest vehicle you&rsquo;ve got. There&rsquo;s a good lot of  it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My lady opened her fine  eyes to their widest extent.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You mean to honour me  with an unusually long visit, it seems,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I thought the Trumpeters  were in Lancashire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Trumpeters are in  Lancashire.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have got leave  of absence, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, my dear Leonora; I  have placed myself in a position to be independent of leaves of absence. It&rsquo;s a  deuced unpleasant thing asking for leave.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Simply that I have sold  out. I disposed of my commission last week. The Trumpeters are still a very  fine corps, but the flower of their flock is lost to them,&rsquo; added the Zoophyte,  twirling his moustache.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sold out!&rsquo; cried Lady  Talmash Brading, aghast, &lsquo;sold out!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my dear Leonora. It  was your own suggestion. &ldquo;If you find the regiment too expensive,&rdquo; you said,  with that stern common sense which has always distinguished you, &ldquo;you ought to  sell out.&rdquo; I did find the regiment too expensive, and I have sold out. It was  the only resource left me for paying my debts, in fact, since you had sworn  never to pay them again.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Your debts! Do you mean  to say that you were in debt again?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Leonora, do you  suppose that there is no such thing as growth in a tailor&rsquo;s bill? Do you imagine  that one&rsquo;s tobacconist&rsquo;s account is not subject to the common laws of  progression? I had a two years&rsquo; accumulation of debt to wipe off &mdash; my creditors  were becoming clamorous, judging by the number of lawyers&rsquo; letters which I  received but did not read &mdash; and my only way of making a clean slate was to sell  my commission.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is shameful,&rsquo;  exclaimed my lady, in a passion, &lsquo;it is positively infamous! In spite of the  two hundred a year I have allowed you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That two hundred a year  was only an incentive to extravagance. It afforded me occasional supplies of  ready-money. Now I can do without ready-money. In short, the two hundred a year  demoralised me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash gave an  impatient sigh. She arose from her seat and began to pace up and down the shady  patch of grass under the sycamore, as it was her habit to do when unpleasantly  excited. Julia Brading twisted the cord and tassels of her little silk apron,  and looked at her uncle with a piteous expression of countenance, longing to  make him an offer of her pocket-money, or to do something for his consolation.  The Zoophyte was the only person unmoved &mdash; he stretched his long legs to their  fullest extent upon a neighbouring bench, and dived into the pocket of his  light overcoat for a splendid seal-skin cigar-case almost big enough for a  small portmanteau. Everything appertaining to the Zoophyte was upon a large  scale, and splendid in colour and texture.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mind smoke out  of doors, I know, Nora,&rsquo; he said blandly, and began to puff away at an enormous  Rio Hondo cigar.</p>
<p>His sister did not even  condescend to notice the inquiry.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is to become of  you?&rsquo; she exclaimed at last, &lsquo;that is the question &mdash; what is to become of you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest Leonora, I  think that is a question that may fairly be relegated to the remote future. I  am naturally a cautious man, and am not in a hurry to make any desperate plunge  in life. In the mean time I can live with you &mdash; there is no objection to that,  I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not, uncle  Regy,&rsquo; cried Julia; &lsquo;you can live with us. &mdash; He can live with us for ever and  ever, can&rsquo;t he, mamma? You know how I was wishing for him only yesterday.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My darling Julia, you  are a child, and don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about. So far as this place  goes there are your uncle&rsquo;s rooms, and he will always be welcome to occupy  them, as long as he pleases. But at his age a man must do something and be  something. It&rsquo;s preposterous to suppose that he can go on dawdling the rest of  his life away here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte yawned, and  murmured that, in his opinion, no man ought to be expected to work after he was  nine-and-twenty. Mr. Ravenscroft&rsquo;s nine-and-twentieth birthday had just gone  by.</p>
<p>The end of it all was,  that he stopped at Brading Park, and strolled in the hothouses and ate ripe  peaches, and played billiards with his niece. A wagon-load of chests and  portmanteaus came from the railway station, and from these receptacles the  Zoophyte produced the greatest marvels in the way of dressing-gowns and  morning-coats and waistcoats and cravats that had ever been seen at Brading, to  say nothing of a whole arsenal of meerschaum pipes, and a dainty little library  of light French literature, with which and with numerous splendid  despatch-boxes, dressing-cases, and tobacco-chests he beautified and adorned  his rooms &mdash; making them so comfortable, in fact, that it was hard to imagine he  would ever be able to tear himself away from them.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 3</strong></h3>
<p>Captain Ravenscroft &mdash; the  rule, once a captain always a captain, was allowed to hold good in his case &mdash; Captain  Ravenscroft had been a year at Brading Park, and he had as yet made no attempt  at a new beginning in life. Sometimes when the Viscountess questioned him upon  the subject, he told her that he was thinking it over, or that he was looking  about him; but nothing came either of his thinking or his looking. There he  was, placid and even-tempered to an extreme degree, the idol of the servants, the  delight of Lady Talmash Brading&rsquo;s visitors, but nevertheless an encumbrance and  responsibility to the lady herself.</p>
<p>Again and again she  returned to the charge. Could he not do something &mdash; at the Bar, for instance?  But the Zoophyte told her, with one of his lazily expressive shrugs, that by  the time he had got through the preliminary business of the Bar, he would be  quite an old man. There was commerce, then, suggested the Viscountess &mdash; the  scions of many noble families had entered the commercial arena lately; could he  not do something in sugar-broking, or shipbuilding, or something of that kind?</p>
<p>The Zoophyte pondered,  and thought that he might perhaps travel in coals &mdash; there was not much  commercial genius required for travelling in coals. The Viscountess gave a  little shriek of horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Travelling in coals! Upon  my word, Reginald, you are incorrigible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then, if you are tired  of me, let me marry Miss Corks,&rsquo; said the Zoophyte; &lsquo;she&rsquo;s a very nice girl,  and I really think she&rsquo;d have me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marry Miss Corks, by all  means,&rsquo; cried the Viscountess indignantly; &lsquo;but please consider yourself a  stranger to me from the hour of your marriage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, as far as that goes,&rsquo;  replied the Zoophyte coolly, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose Miss Corks would have me unless  you did the civil; a girl with a hundred thousand pounds won&rsquo;t enter a family  to be despised &mdash; it isn&rsquo;t likely.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it isn&rsquo;t likely that  I shall receive a brewer&rsquo;s daughter, whose grandfather was a servant in this  house!&rsquo; returned Lady Talmash Brading.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose not; but it&rsquo;s  rather hard upon me,&rsquo; said the Zoo, with a faint moan; &lsquo;she really is a very  nice girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mary Corks certainly was  a nice girl, and a pretty girl into the bargain &mdash; a girl with frank innocent  blue eyes, a pert little nose slightly <em>retrouss&eacute;e</em>,  a perfect rosebud of a mouth, and all manner of artless winning ways that had  gone straight home to the Zoophyte&rsquo;s heart. He had a heart, listless and inane  as he seemed, and Mary Corks reigned therein. She had been very well educated,  and although her father and mother did make sad havoc of the Queen&rsquo;s English,  was quite a lady: a good dutiful daughter too, fond and respectful in her  demeanour towards the simple elderly people, and never ashamed of their  shortcomings.</p>
<p>Yes, she was a dear  little English maiden, and the Zoophyte was very fond of her. He had met her at  subscription balls in Brading, and had danced with her a conspicuous number of  times; he had ridden his quiet hack to covert, and seen her in her dark-blue  riding-habit and coquettish hat with a scarlet feather. He had scraped  acquaintance with old Corks one market-day &mdash; Corks had a profound reverence for  the Talmash Brading family &mdash; and had been invited to dine at the big bran-new  red-brick villa just outside Brading; a pile of building of the gothic order,  with library and billiard-room, smoking-room, and conservatories jutting out  from the main edifice, and a quadrangular mass of stabling that was like a  baronial castle.</p>
<p>Mr. Corks himself  inhabited one cosy little chamber which looked on the poultry-yard &mdash; a room  that had been intended for the housekeeper, and then discarded as too small.  Here the great brewer spent the best part of his life, smoking his clay-pipe,  or studying his banker&rsquo;s-book, or reading the newspapers, in a pleasant  solitude. He called the room the Snuggery, and whenever Mary Corks had a favour  to ask, she used to repair to this chamber.</p>
<p>Captain Ravenscroft dined  a great many times at the Battlements &mdash; Mr. Corks&rsquo; gothic villa was called the  Battlements &mdash; and he heard Mary sing and play, and played billiards with her  after dinner in the great gothic billiard-room, with its big brass lamps and  open oak roof. Sometimes there was a party, consisting of professional people  from Brading, with a sprinkling of the smaller county gentry; sometimes there  was no one; but there was always an excellent dinner and first-rate wines, and  the Zoophyte liked the quiet homely evenings best. He didn&rsquo;t mind Mr. Corks&rsquo;  idiomatic English a bit. He thought Corks a hearty honest old fellow, and  really liked him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I had a fortune,&rsquo;  he said to himself sometimes despondently; &lsquo;I shall seem such a mercenary  scoundrel if I propose to that girl.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He did, however, propose  to her. It wasn&rsquo;t possible to go on very long in her society and not tell her  how much he loved her. Those winning ways of hers quite knocked him over, to  use his own expression. So one evening in the billiard-room he was taken off  his guard, somehow, and before he knew what he was doing, he had asked her to  be his wife.</p>
<p>He had to press the  question a little before he could get any decisive answer. At first she would  only trifle with the billiard-balls with downcast eyes, evading all his  questions; but at last she confessed that he was not quite indifferent to her &mdash;  that she liked him just a little &mdash; well, more than a little &mdash; that she loved  him very much.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But there is papa to be  thought of,&rsquo; she said, looking up at him shyly with her pretty blue eyes. &lsquo;I  don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d ever consent; in fact, I&rsquo;m sure he wouldn&rsquo;t, unless &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless what, darling?&rsquo;  (The Zoophyte had his arm round her waist by this time, and was looking down at  the fair young face with an air of proprietorship.) &lsquo;Unless what, dearest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Unless Lady Talmash  Brading were to use her influence with him. Papa has such a high opinion of her;  and perhaps if he thought she wished it very much, he might give way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte looked very  blank for a moment, but it was only for a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She shall use her  influence, Mary,&rsquo; he cried resolutely. He felt quite desperate &mdash; felt as if he  could drag his sister to the Battlements by main force, and make her sue to Mr.  Corks; anything rather than lose this dear girl, who was looking up at him so  confidingly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Am I to tell papa?&rsquo; she  faltered presently.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, darling. It&rsquo;s  best to be all fair and above-board. Tell papa at once; and I&rsquo;ll tell my  sister, and we&rsquo;ll see what she can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was not very hopeful,  but still he thought his sister could never be so atrociously cruel as to stand  between him and a hundred thousand pounds. It seemed incredible.</p>
<p>But when he came to make  his appeal, he found her obdurate. The idea of such an alliance was not to be  tolerated for a moment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> use my influence to promote the match!&rsquo; she exclaimed, &lsquo;<em>I</em> stoop to that vulgar brewer! you must  be demented to think of such a thing, Reginald. People who have risen from  nothing at my very door &mdash; a girl whose grandfather was a servant!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She can&rsquo;t help that, you  see, Nora; and she&rsquo;s a perfect lady, I give you my honour &mdash; as much a lady as  Julia.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Viscountess gave a  shriek. &lsquo;Yes; and my poor precious Julia is to enter life with the disgrace of  a brewery tacked to her name &mdash; is to make her entrance into the great world  associated with beer!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What nonsense, Leonora!  As if my wife&rsquo;s connections need affect Julia! All you have to do is to be  civil to old Corks, and tell him you&rsquo;ll be glad to welcome his daughter as a  member of your family. That kind of man sets such value upon rank, you&rsquo;ll be  able to wind him round your finger. And she really is the dearest girl in the  world, Nora.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not to be heard  of!&rsquo; exclaimed the Viscountess decisively.</p>
<p>A day or two after this,  Captain Ravenscroft received another invitation to dine at the Battlements. He  opined that this meant business, and went there in some trepidation. The dinner  went off pleasantly enough. Mary was very silent, and blushed a great deal  without adequate provocation, but looked her prettiest. After dinner the  Zoophyte would fain have strolled off to the conservatories or the billiard-room,  according to his usual custom, but Mr. Corks stopped him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should like a word or  two with you in my room, Captain,&rsquo; he said, in a very friendly tone. &lsquo;Johnson,  take a bottle of Lafitte to the Snuggery.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The butler obeyed, and  led the way, carrying a massive silver salver, with the claret and two clear  bell shaped glasses. It was a summer evening, and the Snuggery was warm, not to  say stuffy. Even the open window only admitted an odour of live poultry; but  the Zoophyte didn&rsquo;t mind this. He felt that his future was at stake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take some of that there  claret,&rsquo; said the brewer. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a better sort than I usually give you, though I  don&rsquo;t give you bad. But I thought you should have the best to-night,&rsquo; he added,  with a chuckle.</p>
<p>They filled their  glasses. The brewer drained his at a draught; the Zoophyte sipped his wine in  silence. He was very nervous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My little girl has been  a-telling of me something,&rsquo; Mr. Corks began, &mdash; &lsquo;something about you. Now, I  want to know first and foremost, are you in earnest?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thoroughly in earnest &mdash; with  all my heart and soul,&rsquo; replied the Zoophyte, with unwonted energy.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And it ain&rsquo;t her money  you&rsquo;re after, hay?&rsquo; asked the brewer. &lsquo;You like the girl for her own sake?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I love her so dearly,  that I would marry her to-morrow if she hadn&rsquo;t a penny.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine.  But how would you keep her if she hadn&rsquo;t a penny, I should like to know?  However, luckily she&rsquo;ll have plenty. I can give her a handsome fortune without  feeling the loss of the money. And I don&rsquo;t care about her marrying a rich man.  I&rsquo;m not the sort of fellow that wants to join money to money. My father spent  his life among the nobility, and he taught me a respect for rank. Money&rsquo;s a  very good thing in its way, but it&rsquo;s all the better when it&rsquo;s joined to rank.  Now, all other points being agreeable, I shouldn&rsquo;t mind my daughter being  sister-in-law to Lady Talmash Brading. It would sound well &mdash; &ldquo;My sister the  Viscountess,&rdquo; hay? You see, I&rsquo;m a candid sort of a chap, and don&rsquo;t make any  concealment of my feelings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Ravenscroft  bowed. It seemed pretty smooth sailing so far; but there were rocks and shoals  ahead, no doubt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now the question is,&rsquo;  said the brewer, &lsquo;does your sister know of this?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;She does,&rsquo; replied the  Zoophyte gravely.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And does she approve of  it?&rsquo; The Zoophyte hesitated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have no doubt that she  will approve ultimately,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;She cannot fail to approve.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Cannot fail to  fiddlestick!&rsquo; cried Mr. Corks impatiently. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not a-going to let my girl  marry into a grand family that will turn their noses up at her. If you expect  to get my Mary, and my Mary&rsquo;s money, the Viscountess must come here to me, and  let me know that her heart goes with the business, and that she&rsquo;ll be a sister  to my girl. There must be no shilly-shally about that. And now, Captain  Ravenscroft, what may be the income upon which you intend to begin housekeeping?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte was fain to  confess that all his worldly wealth consisted of the two hundred per annum  which his sister allowed him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, upon my word,  you&rsquo;re a cool customer!&rsquo; cried the brewer, with a good-natured laugh that was  very reassuring. &lsquo;However, I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do with, you. Let your  sister allow you five hundred a year, and settle it upon you, so as she can&rsquo;t  change her mind &mdash; it won&rsquo;t be much, but it&rsquo;ll be something &mdash; and I&rsquo;ll give my  girl fifty thousand down on the nail; settled upon herself and her children  after her, of course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied the  Zoophyte.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And let Lady Talmash  Brading come to me in a friendly way, and talk the business over. I don&rsquo;t want  no hole-and-corner work. If my Mary enters a high family, she must enter it  like a lady.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Ravenscroft  promised that his sister should do all that was needful. And again he had that  desperate feeling, that he would make her bow the knee before this resolute  brewer rather than lose such a girl as Mary.</p>
<p>He went home that night  not elated but grave. He knew that his sister was an obstinate woman, and that  he had a difficult task before him. Early next morning he presented himself in  her favourite room &mdash; a great sunny bow-windowed apartment, looking out upon the  flower-garden. He presented himself before her, and stated his requirements in  a business-like manner. It was a matter of life or death to him, he said  finally. He should be a blighted man if he did not marry Mary Corks.</p>
<p>His eloquence was all  wasted. Lady Talmash was obdurate. It was not the five hundred per annum,  though the request was certainly a cool one. She might have strained a point to  give him that, had he been about to make an appropriate marriage; but she would  never receive Mary Corks. She would never degrade herself in the sight of the  county by alliance with that upstart brewer. She was very angry, as she was  wont to be when the Corks question was mooted, and she said a great deal.</p>
<p>The Zoophyte heard her  with his usual placidity. Even a matter of life and death could not goad him  into the display of much emotion. The interview was a long one, and he used the  strongest arguments he could think of; but to the end he was mild and tranquil.  At the very last he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is that final, Leonora?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quite final.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then I may as well wish  you good-bye. I shall leave the Park this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash looked  surprised. &lsquo;There is no occasion for that,&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;I have no quarrel  with you, Reginald. I am only inflexible upon the subject of Miss Corks. There  is no occasion for you to go away.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon, my  dear Leonora. You have often reproached me with my want of energy &mdash; my  disinclination to enter upon a new career. I begin to feel that your reproaches  were well founded, and I have made my plans for placing myself in a position to  earn my own living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Indeed! you surprise me,  Reginald. This is rather a new idea, is it not?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes; it is rather  a new idea,&rsquo; answered the Zoophyte calmly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what line have you  chosen &mdash; anything in the commercial way?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; the business is  commercial.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nothing horrid, I hope,&rsquo;  cried the Viscountess, with an alarmed look. &lsquo;Not travelling in coals, or  anything of that kind?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, no; there&rsquo;s no  travelling &mdash; it&rsquo;s quite a stationary business, and clean. I really think I  shall like it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You are very mysterious,  Regy; you might just as well tell me frankly what you are going to do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about  it, if I succeed. In any case, you must take it as a compliment that I am  anxious to follow your advice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose so; but I  should like to have been more in your confidence. However, I daresay it&rsquo;s all  right. At any rate I can tolerate anything sooner than your marrying Miss  Corks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte smiled &mdash; it  was scarcely a smiling matter, but he decidedly smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re so  prejudiced on that point,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re going up to town  by the next train?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no, not by the  next &mdash; I&rsquo;m going away very soon, though. You don&rsquo;t mind my leaving the bulk of  my luggage here, do you, Nora?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course not. You can  consider those rooms always your own.&rsquo; </p>
<p>They shook hands, kissed  each other even, a display of affection to which they were not particularly given,  and parted. Captain Ravenscroft packed a portmanteau and carpet-bag, and  carried them away with him in a Brading fly. He declined to avail himself of  the Park stables for his exodus, and the Park servants said there had been a  quarrel between the Captain and his sister.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know about  that,&rsquo; said one of the housemaids; &lsquo;I was cleaning the yellow room all the time  they was a-talking in my lady&rsquo;s morning-room, and I didn&rsquo;t hear high words  between &rsquo;em.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;d never hear high  words from the Captain,&rsquo; answered the housekeeper; &lsquo;it isn&rsquo;t in him. But take my  word for it there&rsquo;s been a quarrel, or the Captain wouldn&rsquo;t be going away all  of a sudden like this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte contrived to  evade any farewell between himself and Julia.</p>
<p>He was tender-hearted  upon some subjects, and his niece was one of them.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 4</strong></h3>
<p>For a fortnight Lady  Talmash Brading heard nothing of her brother. In the depths of her heart she  was glad that he was gone, though she dared not own as much to Julia, who  sorely bemoaned uncle Regy&rsquo;s departure. The Corks affair was off: that was the  grand point in the mind of the Viscountess. She was not very well during that  fortnight &mdash; had a slight attack of summer influenza or hay fever, and took  numerous mild sedatives and saline draughts furnished by the most courteous and  sympathetic of provincial doctors. She was a prisoner to the house, therefore,  and Julia stayed at home with her, and was not to be lured away by the  brightest days. Towards the end of the fortnight Lady Talmash surprised her own  maid looking at her once or twice in a curious way, as if there was some  revelation she would like to make if she dared. The housekeeper, too, had a  peculiar manner one morning when she held a conference with her mistress. Once,  too, Lady Talmash actually saw the butler &mdash; the grave elderly butler, who  looked like a pillar of the state in his respectable solemnity &mdash; exchange a  subdued grin with his subordinate, as if their minds were burdened with some  common joke. The subordinate &mdash; as inferior in breeding to his chief &mdash; even gave  a suppressed chuckle and splutter, and was fain to busy himself suddenly at the  sideboard in order to hide his guilty countenance from Lady Talmash Brading&rsquo;s  majesty.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some vulgar village joke,  no doubt,&rsquo; she thought; &lsquo;but if that man laughs again, he must go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At last the Viscountess  was pronounced well enough to go out. She took longer to get well, of course,  than a common person, and the Brading surgeon was as punctilious and solemn as  if she had been at death&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You really might take an  airing in your pony-carriage, my lady,&rsquo; and then he added in a strange downcast  way, &lsquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t go far, I wouldn&rsquo;t expose myself to fatigue or worry just  yet. A drive in the park, now, would be best.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I hate prowling about  the park,&rsquo; my lady answered impatiently. &lsquo;If I go out at all, I shall go for a  long drive. A park ought to be twenty miles round at least for it to be  tolerable to drive in. &mdash; Julia, put on your hat, and tell Perkins to bring me  my things.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Brading practitioner  dared not remonstrate: he murmured something about &lsquo;care,&rsquo; and not staying out  too long for the first time; and then took his polite departure. As he was  crossing the hall, and afterwards in his carriage, he indulged in a suppressed  chuckle, very much like the under butler&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s to be hoped she  won&rsquo;t drive into Brading,&rsquo; he said to himself; &lsquo;if she does, there&rsquo;ll be the  devil to pay.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash did drive  into Brading. She took a pleasant country round first, through green lanes  where the dog-roses were in their glory, and then came homewards through  Brading High-street. It was a pleasant gay-looking street enough, with old  gable ends, and latticed windows in the upper stories, and here and there a  house decorated with elaborate wood-work carved into heraldic devices &mdash; a house  that had been occupied by some notable citizen in days gone by.</p>
<p>Half way down, the street  opened out into a wide square market-place, with a piazza and clock-tower in  the centre; and just here there was a sharp corner, where the pavement was  narrow, and the shop-fronts seemed to butt out upon the road in a rather  aggressive manner. When Lady Talmash Brading&rsquo;s pony-carriage came to this  point, Julia, whose quick eyes roamed everywhere, gave a little cry of  surprise.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look, mamma!&rsquo; she  exclaimed; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s a new pork-shop, such a nice one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Julia, I wish you would  not call out in that way &mdash; about new pork-shops, too &mdash; it&rsquo;s so absurd.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was a heavy wagon  in front of them just at this moment, and Lady Talmash was fain to rein in her  eager ponies. She had leisure to look listlessly up at the shop.</p>
<p>It was a pork-butcher&rsquo;s,  with tender young piglings hanging before the window, and sausages in dainty-looking  baskets inside &mdash; a most attractive-looking pork-butcher&rsquo;s &mdash; and on the board  above the window was painted in conspicuous characters the name of Reginald  Ravenscroft.</p>
<p>Yes, it was there! It was  not a diabolical delusion, like the cat and the skeleton and the gentleman  usher in Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s Demonology &mdash; it was not an awful dream. The  inscription was there &mdash; &lsquo;REGINALD RAVENSCROFT, PORK-BUTCHER.&rsquo; And hanging in  the windows there were placards announcing &lsquo;Dairy-fed Pork,&rsquo; &lsquo;Fine Cambridge  Sausages fresh daily and so on.</p>
<p>The Viscountess flung the  reins to her daughter and sprang out of the carriage. She who had never before  entered a provision shop of less distinction than Morel&rsquo;s or Fortnum and  Mason&rsquo;s, walked straight through the narrow door of the pork-butcher&rsquo;s, her  silken skirts actually brushing against a little tin tray of mysterious edible  lumps, simmering in grease, and labelled &lsquo;Ducks, a penny each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My lady saw the ducks,  and shuddered. They diffused a savoury odour of sage-and-onion, and on the  counter inside there was a large roasted leg of pork, with accompaniments.</p>
<p>It was market-day, and  Reginald Ravenscroft, pork-butcher, was not above turning an honest penny by  the sale of a cooked joint. The smell of the shop made Lady Talmash feel very  faint, but she could not turn any paler than she was when she entered it. She  had been white with anger when she stepped out of her pony-carriage.</p>
<p>Reginald Ravenscroft,  pork-butcher, was standing behind his counter in a clean white apron, looking  the very image of placid contentment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray, may I ask the  meaning of this degrading absurdity?&rsquo; demanded the Viscountess in a voice that  was tremulous with rage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, my dear  Leonora. I am quite ready to explain my motives. You urged me to make a  position for myself, and I ultimately resolved to do so. I did not feel that I  had a genius for the higher walks of commerce, but I did consider myself a good  judge of pork. This shop was to let, and people hereabouts told me a pork-butcher&rsquo;s  was wanted. And I must say that the business has been remarkably brisk since I  opened the place last week. Those ducks now, in the tin at the door &mdash; they&rsquo;re the  things Londoners call fagots &mdash; you&rsquo;ve no idea how they go off at a penny; and  there&rsquo;s a profit upon them, though you&rsquo;d hardly believe it. Have a duck; let me  get you a clean plate, and try a duck. They&rsquo;re uncommonly savoury. I make them  myself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash did not  deign to notice this polite offer. Two stalwart country fellows came in at this  moment, and bought some roast pork. It was a pleasant sight to see the Zoophyte  slicing the leg, not forgetting the stuffing and the gravy, and giving change for  half-a-crown with a thoroughly businesslike air. When the men were gone, Lady  Talmash returned to the charge.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, Reginald,&rsquo; she  began sternly, &lsquo;will you be good enough to explain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest creature, I  have explained,&rsquo; he answered in his blandest manner. &lsquo;What more can I say? It  was necessary that I should do something, and this business suits me. You can&rsquo;t  imagine what an endearing animal a pig is, considered as dairy-fed pork. As  bacon he&rsquo;s large and uninteresting &mdash; runs into rashers, and becomes monotonous;  but there&rsquo;s a really artistic pleasure in cutting up such pork as that,&rsquo; said  the Zoophyte, patting a pink-looking loin. &lsquo;And then there&rsquo;s the sucking-pig &mdash; see  what a variety he imparts to the business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is this meant for a  joke, Reginald? If so, it is a most contemptible one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A joke! &mdash; not at all. I  was never more serious in my life. You prevented my marriage with the dearest  little girl in the world, who would have brought me fifty thousand pounds, and  you upbraided me on the subject of my disinclination to get my own living. It  was time I should do something. I am sorry your repugnance to the beer trade  extends to the pig trade also.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I see,&rsquo; said my lady  indignantly, &lsquo;this is an act of revenge.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I won&rsquo;t admit that,  Leonora; but it is an act of self-assertion. You wouldn&rsquo;t let me marry Mary  Corks, so I have taken to pork as a consolation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will allow you five  hundred a year,&rsquo; said Lady Talmash impetuously &mdash; &lsquo;settle it upon you &mdash; if  you&rsquo;ll abandon this most degrading course.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks; this is a very  generous offer, but I really would rather rely upon my own exertions and pigs.  You see I have only just discovered that I can get my own living.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lady Talmash argued and  protested, but it was no use. The Zoophyte, after his own tranquil fashion, was  as firm as a rock. He was really attached to the pork trade, he repeated, with  a calm persistence that was exasperating to the last degree.</p>
<p>The Viscountess drove  home in dead silence. Even the much-indulged Julia dared not question her, her  countenance was too awful. For a week she did nothing, but day and night she  was pursued by the image of her brother Reginald Ravenscroft selling pork to  the commonalty of Brading &mdash; the late captain of the Queen&rsquo;s Own Trumpeters, in  shirt-sleeves and a white apron, cutting up pigs!</p>
<p>After enduring this for a  week, Lady Talmash found that she could bear it no longer. She must do  something, anything, to put an end to the unspeakable humiliation. She ordered  her carriage and drove to Brading High-street, and went once more into the neat  little pork-shop &mdash; past the tray of &nbsp;&lsquo;Ducks,  a penny each.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Zoophyte was behind  his counter, in snow-white shirt-sleeves and spotless apron.</p>
<p>She could only use the  same arguments that she had employed before. She was willing to allow him five  hundred a year &mdash; six &mdash; seven &mdash; eight hundred even, if he would abandon that  degrading employment.</p>
<p>The Zoophyte shrugged his  shoulders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Bring Mary Corks here  and let her ask me to give up the business,&rsquo; he said decisively. &lsquo;There is no  one else who could wean me from pigs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What, humiliate myself  to those Corks people, after all I have said?&rsquo; cried Lady Talmash.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Either that or endure my  connection with pork. I really can&rsquo;t see that it&rsquo;s any discredit to you. It&rsquo;s a  very clean business.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Viscountess was  vanquished. It was a hard thing to bow the knee, as it were, to Mr. Corks the  brewer; but anything was preferable to this pork business, this open scandal,  which of course had set all Brading talking about her, and had provoked her  very menials to audacious grinning in her superb presence. She told her  coachman to drive straight to the Battlements; and half an hour after her  interview with the Zoophyte she was seated in the gorgeous new drawing-room,  where all the furniture looked as if it had just come out of the upholsterer&rsquo;s  shop, talking to Mr. and Mrs. Corks.</p>
<p>She could be very  charming when she chose, and the brewer and his wife yielded immediately to her  fascination. She was candour itself &mdash; told them frankly of the prejudice  against trade, and the unworthy means that Captain Ravenscroft had taken to  break through it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is a rum start,  certainly,&rsquo; said Mr. Corks, &lsquo;and there&rsquo;s been a deal of talk about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Viscountess shivered  a little &mdash; that she should ever seek a matrimonial alliance with a family whose  head talked of &lsquo;a rum start&rsquo;! &mdash; but the image of the pork-butcher&rsquo;s shop was in  her mind, and she smiled one of her sweetest smiles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must get him to  abandon this folly, Mr. Corks,&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;now I know that your pretty daughter  has more influence with him than any one else; she must persuade him to give up  pork butchering, and when they are married I will settle five or six hundred a  year upon him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll receive my  girl as a member of your family, hay, my lady? You won&rsquo;t go and turn your back  upon her directly she&rsquo;s married?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Mr. Corks, I am not  capable of that. If your daughter marries my brother with my approval, I shall  treat her as a sister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it&rsquo;s a bargain, my  lady,&rsquo; cried Corks. &lsquo;Mary&rsquo;s desperate fond of the Captain, and she shall have him.  I said I wouldn&rsquo;t consent to the match unless you were agreeable to it, and  I&rsquo;ve kept my word. But the girl&rsquo;s been going on anyhow, and has talked about  that pork-butcher&rsquo;s shop as if it was the greatest thing that was ever done &mdash; like  going aboard a lifeboat, or heading a forlorn hope, or summat of that sort.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Corks came into the  room presently, looking so blooming and so pretty, and behaving with such perfect  propriety, that Lady Talmash could not help being pleased with her. She bore  the girl off in her carriage at once, and drove back to the pork-shop, where  there was a brief and animated little scene performed between the Zoophyte and  the two ladies.</p>
<p>The shutters went up that  afternoon, and the name of Reginald Ravenscroft was painted out upon the space  above them. Captain Ravenscroft and Miss Corks were married six weeks  afterwards. Mary has been presented at Court by her sister-in-law, and Brading  Park and the Battlements have exchanged dinners, much to the delight of Mr. and  Mrs. Corks. The Captain has furnished a dear little house in Mayfair, where he  lives very happily with his pretty young wife and the society he likes, running  down to Brading occasionally, to be received with all honour at the Battlements  or the Park. The pork-butcher business will be remembered at Brading to the end  of time, but it is popularly supposed the Captain did the thing for a wager. </p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="AWateringPlaceAboutToBecomeFamous"></a>A Watering-Place About To Become Famous</strong></h2>
<p>I will call it Arnheim, a  name by which, as most readers of these lines are aware, Edgar Allan Poe has  designated a very delicious abode, the creation of his exuberant fancy.</p>
<p>Ere the traveller can  reach the delectable spot about to be described, he must traverse a long dreary  tract of moorland. As he passes its borders, he sees stretching before him, for  a considerable distance, a brown plain of unbroken flatness, terminated by a  brown range of hills, rising gradually to the height of seven or eight hundred  feet. This melancholy region is so densely clothed with heather, that only on  those portions which skirt the road can be seen the narrow tracts of stunted  herbage from which a few scattered sheep derive their scanty nourishment. All  is silence and monotony; the sense of the former being only made the more  striking by the murmur of the invisible sea, shrouded from view by a long low  ridge, at about a quarter of a mile&rsquo;s distance to the right of the traveller,  and by the cropping of the sheep along the margin of the road. This, at length,  begins to ascend the desolate range of hills in front, the highest point of  which, owing to the figuration of the ground, seems continually to elude the  traveller, By the time it is gained, probably half-baked by the summer sun,  certainly wearied by his monotonous drive, he has very likely sunk into a  semi-somnolent condition. Aroused by a change in the motion of his vehicle,  which indicates a rapid descent, he opens his drowsy eyes and looks around him.  Is he in dreamland? he asks himself. Can this sudden and marvellous  transformation scene, of which he is the spectator, be indeed <em>in rerum natura</em>? Well may he pause for a  moment ere he satisfies himself of the reality of the prospect which now  unfolds itself before him. Every vestige of the bleak moorland has vanished.  From the park-like scenery, dotted with clumps of trees and brilliant with  wild-flowers, through which he is passing, he sees the road in front tunnelled  by the massive foliage which clothes the sloping sides of a deep amphitheatre,  into which he is descending. On his right, sprinkled with fairy-like craft, is  spread the calm sunlit sea. As though seeking as close neighbourhood as  possible with earth&rsquo;s beauty, it has apparently struggled into the form of a  little bay below him. On the area enclosed by the hills, which, from a  distance, looks like one vast flower-garden, are erected numerous villas and a  few large public buildings. On a wide plateau, about three hundred feet higher,  more houses appear above the trees, which screen the slope upon which they  stand. Scarcely has the traveller recovered from his surprise, and taken a  hasty general survey of so many combined beauties, when they are hidden from  his sight by the entrance of the road into the deep leafy tunnel, from which it  only emerges at the foot of the declivity.</p>
<p>Farther progress is here  arrested by a pretty toll-gate of rustic structure. From an adjoining cottage,  embowered in westeria, jasmine, and other creepers, issues its civil keeper,  into whose hands the traveller, previously informed of the tax, deposits a  sovereign. He then writes his name and address in a ledger, and receives from  the tollman a glazed card, bearing the following superscription:</p>
<p align="center" class="note">ARNHEIM COMPANY (LIMITED)</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;On presenting this card,  the bearer will be admitted, free of charge, to all the <em>al-fresco f&ecirc;tes</em>, public concerts, and balls given at Arnheim, from  June 1 to October 1.</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;N.B. Persons of  notoriously objectionable character are excluded from the above-mentioned  entertainments.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The gate opened, the  traveler crosses a bridge, which spans an impetuous torrent issuing from a  thickly-wooded gorge on his left hand. From this spot he obtains a full view of  the delightful watering-place where, I am convinced, he will sojourn for at  least two months. Would that I might enjoy the same pleasurable prospect! Our  friend, however, has not much time to spare for gazing on the attractive  objects which surround him. It is nearly six o&rsquo;clock, at which hour the inmates  of the Arnheim Hotel sit down to their <em>table-d&rsquo;  h&oacute;te</em> dinner. At this place of public entertainment the traveller has been  advised to &lsquo;descend;&rsquo; and there it is, about a dozen paces from the bridge over  the East Arn, the windows of its left wing (it is a quadrangular building)  overlooking that brisk and fussy little stream. Conducted to his bedroom, and  left there with his <em>impedimenta</em>, he  perceives a placard on the wall informing him that his board (breakfast, lunch,  and dinner), lodging, and attendance will cost him two pounds ten a week. On  descending to the spacious dining-room, in which about sixty persons are  already seated, he finds a cover reserved for him beside a friend, who, he is  aware, had arrived at Arnheim a few days previously. Although fastidious in  culinary matters, our friend rises from table gratified and surprised:  gratified, because what he has eaten and drunk has been sufficient in quantity  and good in quality; surprised, because his gratification will be purchased at  an evidently moderate outlay.</p>
<p>The dinner was served <em>&agrave; la Russe</em>, the table being decorated  with several handsome epergnes containing fruits and flowers. Upon it were  likewise some tasteful little fountains with scented waters, which spread an  agreeable fragrance and a sense of coolness through the room. The <em>menu</em>, copies of which were distributed  among the diners, written in plain English, was as follows: Vermicelli soup,  boiled salmon; sweetbreads, with Dutch sauce; roast lamb, ducklings; potatoes,  cauliflower, and green peas; salad, iced pudding, and apricot tart. A pint of  claret, which, if Gladstonian, was at least not &lsquo;doctored,&rsquo; was placed beside  each cover, no farther charge being made for its consumption. Another hotel at  Upper Arnheim (the cluster of houses upon the elevated plateau already  mentioned) is conducted on the same system as its subjacent rival.</p>
<p>Dinner over, our two  friends saunter from the hotel on a tour of inspection, and to hear the evening  band, which discourses sweet music between the hours of seven and eight. In the  wide verandah, which runs along the front and the two wings of the hotel,  several parties are taking their seats at little marble-slabbed tables for  their postprandial coffee and cigars. A large fountain, in the middle of the  court, supplies with water a stone basin, in which gold and silver fish are  disporting themselves. Issuing from the precincts, they have a full view of the  lofty-wooded, rock-surmounted slopes in which Amheim nestles, and of the blue  expanse of sea which lies on their left. Those leafy heights are not entirely  left under Nature&rsquo;s sway. As is evident from the occasional glimpses of  ornamental landscape through which the falls of the West Arn rush from boulder  to boulder, the hand of art has been employed in developing, by tasteful  arrangement, natural beauties.</p>
<p>But the new-comer&rsquo;s  attention is first claimed by objects in his immediate vicinity. He observes  that all the dwelling-houses in Arnheim are detached buildings, created  according to English adaptation of Italian architecture. It is a new place, and  therefore it wisely eschews all imitation of mediaeval and Tudor models,  suitable as those are for large country houses, and in old towns where they  harmonise with existing antique erections. To each house is attached a garden  and lawn, varying from a half to a whole acre. These are flaming with scarlet  geraniums, roses, sweet peas, and fuchsias. No stone walls are visible, the  grounds being separated by low hedges, or neat wire or rustic fences, mostly  clad with ivy and flowering creepers. The whole area is interspersed with fine  oak, lime, beech, and ilex trees.</p>
<p>From about the middle of  the main road through the village, a street &mdash; the only street properly so  called in the place, consisting entirely of shops &mdash; branches off to the right,  and opens into a circular space, round which sweep two colonnades, the vista  being terminated by a building in the Corinthian style of architecture, with  two collateral wings. This is the theatre, in which representations are given  three nights weekly, one of which is an operatic performance. In the right wing  is a restaurant, with a billiard-room in the upper story; in the left is the  concert-hall, surmounted by the ball-room. Twice a week, musicians are ready to  afford visitors the opportunity of tripping the light fantastic toe; on the  remaining lawful night a vocal and instrumental concert takes place.</p>
<p>All these entertainments  begin at eight o&rsquo;clock, and are never prolonged beyond eleven; a wise rule  established in honour of Hygeia, the presiding deity of Arnheim. The only one  which exacts payment is the theatre; admission to the dress-circle being  half-a-crown, that to the pit and upper boxes a shilling.</p>
<p>A handsome domed  structure, with a facade like that of St. Paul&rsquo;s in miniature, stands at the  extremity of the main road, facing the hotel whence our two friends set forth.  On approaching it, it is seen to be in the form of a Greek cross.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A church, evidently,&rsquo;  remarks the new-comer to his acquaintance, &lsquo;and one which seems much too large  for the requirements of the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That building,&rsquo; is the  reply, &lsquo;typifies the good feeling which exists among professors of all  religions in Arnheim. It contains five churches. In the nave, service is  performed according to the rites of the Established Church; in the choir, the  Roman Catholics celebrate Mass; in the right transept, the hymns of Wesley are  sung; under the dome every Sunday the Baptist finds a minister of his  persuasion; in the left transept, energetic discourses are delivered by a Scotch  Presbyterian. Each division is of course separated by thick walls from its  neighbour, and has its special entrance. A fine ornamental structure is the  result. Its cost was great; but owing to the large resources at the command of  the Arnheim Company, the liberality of householders, the small weekly tax of  one shilling imposed on all who take advantage of the ministrations within the  building, it is hoped that the remnant of debt which still burdens this  beautiful basilica will soon be paid off. Then, of course, admission to the  services will be gratuitous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here, strains of music,  hitherto heard faintly by the two gentlemen during their walk, again reaching  their ears, after an interval of silence, with greater force and distinctness,  attract them towards the spot whence they seem to proceed. Turning to the left  from the church, they follow a gravel walk winding through a dense and lofty  shrubbery. In a few minutes they arrive at an open space at the extremity of  the amphitheatre, where the sea and the wooded heights converge. This space,  varying in breadth from a hundred to twenty yards, is about four acres in  extent.</p>
<p>Beyond it farther  prospect is excluded by a wooded height terminating in a bold cliff which  projects into the sea. This angle of ground is arranged as a park, interspersed  with clumps of fine trees, and bordered on the side next the hills with a  sloping bank brilliant with rows of white, blue, and scarlet flowers. In the  centre of the park stands a &lsquo;kiosque,&rsquo; in which about thirty musicians are  playing a selection from <em>Faust</em>. At  the farther end is a pretty chalet, which does duty as a restaurant; and here,  there, and everywhere gay parties are sitting or sauntering about, listening to  the band, or engaged in conversation. Long after the music has ceased, our two  friends linger in this delicious spot. The gay promenaders betake themselves to  the ball-or reading-room, or wend towards the pier, intent on spending an hour  or two on the water &mdash; whence presently the evening breeze will waft to the shore  their voices, joined in glee or duet. The birds, too, sing their wild evensong;  the sun sets; the shadows and dews of eve fall on flower-bed and lawn; the moon  forms a lucent pathway on the sea; and our friends turn homewards,  congratulating themselves on their meeting at the most enjoyable watering-place  in the British Empire.</p>
<p>Here, perhaps, I should  bring this paper to a conclusion. But in order that, at the first opportunity,  they may pack up and journey thither, I am conscious that my readers would like  to know where Arnheim is. Ah, so should I &mdash; very much indeed. Yes; it is a  lamentable fact that no such place does actually exist in these three kingdoms.  But, then, in the realm of potentialities, I assure you it is flourishing in  all its beauty and pleasure-giving capabilities. Nay, more; the groundwork of  my design is ready for the operations of the Company already alluded to. Many  of my readers may have already recognised it through the embroidery with which  I have pretty thickly covered it. For the information of others, I may state  that Lynmouth in North Devon has been in the eye of my mind during the  composition of this paper.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear old place,&rsquo; I hear  some of its admirers exclaim, &lsquo;it would be sacrilege to disturb it in its  picturesque quietude. Italian villas and foreign gaieties at Lynmouth indeed &mdash; tasteless,  shocking!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I confess that I  sympathise with the feeling which prompts such an objection; but I answer, we  must legislate for the future as well as regard with tenderness the past.  Hardworking generations &mdash; and it seems likely that work will every day be  widened and intensified &mdash; require occasionally that relief which to many is  only afforded by a transition to scenes of gaiety and pleasurable excitement.  Really, except to wealthy visitors, English watering-places do not offer varied  sources of amusement and &lsquo;distraction.&rsquo; There is, of course, bathing &mdash; which  whiles away half an hour. In fine weather, there may be boating, strolling, or  listlessly lounging, on the sands or promenade; in bad weather, the circulating  library and the billiard-room are the only resources. Consequently, unless  flirtation, perilous diversion! be accessible, <em>ennui</em> rules supreme over a considerable portion of the time spent  in these so-called resorts of pleasure. This state of things imperatively  demands amelioration. It seems to me that Lynmouth, which combines so many  beauties and attractions of various kinds, is about the best place in which  that amelioration can be commenced.</p>
<p>With respect to the ways  and means towards this blissful consummation, I confess that I am not competent  to give satisfactory details. I have, however, formed some crude ideas on the  subject, which are at the service of any one who thinks it worth his while to  examine them and to discover their originator. But when I mention the magic  word &lsquo;Company&rsquo; &mdash; connected with so assuredly popular an undertaking as the  transformation of Lynmouth into Arnheim &mdash; who is there in this enlightened  nineteenth century that can doubt, I do not say of the feasibilty, but of the  eminent success, of the enterprise? </p>

<p>Gentle reader &mdash; for thus  I address you, wishing to be on a good footing with you, and to establish  comfortable relations at once &mdash; besides, it sounds well, and has a certain air  of respectability about it &mdash; do you know St. Brelade&rsquo;s Bay in Jersey? If so,  and if you are not disinclined &mdash; as of course you are not: gentle readers never  are &mdash; to make allowance for poor human nature, you will willingly agree with  me, that when a man is comfortably installed in that most charming of bays, he  may indeed, like a certain ex-premier, whose immortal name must never be  mentioned above a whisper, be disposed to &lsquo;rest and be thankful,&rsquo; and will  easily imagine that it was not until after a couple of futile attempts that I  summoned up sufficient courage to catch the 6.30 a.m. boat to Granville.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A cheerful morning, with  a vengeance,&rsquo; I muttered to myself as I embarked on board the Granville, wroth  with the weather and a hurried breakfast; where, enveloping myself, not <em>mea virtute</em>, for that would have been  but a very questionable protection, but in an antiquated old pea-jacket &mdash; a  sort of &lsquo;flag that&rsquo;s braved a thousand storms&rsquo; &mdash; I took up my quarters on one  of those old rickety camp-stools that invariably seize every opportunity of capsizing  at the most inconvenient times; scowling at everybody and everything, and  looking about as cheerful as a fellow who has just received a letter informing  him of his having been cut off with the stereotyped shilling; nor did I recover  my equanimity until, after a <em>triste</em> passage of more than three hours in a little apology for a steamboat, we hove  in sight of our port of destination.</p>
<p>Granville is a bustling little  seaport in the Department of La Manche, and presents rather an imposing  appearance when first seen, rising like Venus from the sea (that&rsquo;s not a bad  simile, by the way). The cliffs rise boldly above the water, which has that  intense blue colour so characteristic of Norman bays, and which, at the time of  our arrival, was covered with ships and fishing-boats. The Customs examination  seemed to be only nominal, as on my informing a polite douanier, whose hat  would have astonished Lincoln and Bennett, that I had only a toothbrush and a  pair of boots in my knapsack, I was permitted to land without any farther  trouble.</p>
<p>I had no intention of  staying long in Granville; so I bent myself to-the burden, boldly shouldered my  knapsack, and started off for Avranches, which is some twenty-seven kilometres  (about seventeen miles) from Granville, disregarding the numerous solicitations  of the &lsquo;diligence&rsquo; men, and drivers of a miscellaneous description of omnibus.</p>
<p>The road to Avranches is  truly magnificent, perfectly straight for most of the way, with posts marking  the distance at every kilometre; but most of the scenery is flat and  uninteresting. The weather by this time had altered, and, nautically speaking,  it was a &lsquo;piping hot&rsquo; day, and I gladly arrived, at Sartilly, a village of one  street only, not unlike Grampound in Cornwall, where I refreshed the inner man  with some detestable cognac. Not a soul was stirring in the village; the men  were in the Paris barracks, the women in the fields. Nothing saddened me more  than seeing work, that in England is performed by men, in Normandy done by  women; and one cannot help moralising on a system that withdraws from  agriculture the <em>&eacute;lite</em> of the French  working classes. Now and then I pass a <em>paysan</em>,  shuffling along in his noisy <em>sabots</em>,  a priest to whom I uncover religiously, and who courteously returns my salute,  or a country girl on horseback going to market. Why, I wonder &mdash; I like  wondering, in open contempt of Flaccus and his <em>nil admirari</em> theory &mdash; why do they call Norman girls pretty? I  cannot say that I admired them much, having a profound objection to lank hair  and sallow faces &mdash; nor did I see that profusion of yellow tresses for which  they are said to be so celebrated; perhaps the dealers in hair had recently  been making their rounds.</p>
<p>The country becomes much  prettier and picturesque on approaching Avranches, but I was becoming fast  knocked up, and was walking about as cheerfully as a man on the way to the  scaffold; and it was with an intense feeling of disgust that I came in sight of  the hill that one has to ascend before arriving at the town &mdash; a hill to which  Pelion upon Ossa would be a joke. Before &lsquo;facing&rsquo; it, I bought some grapes, and  sat down lotus-eating on the banks of the winding, not to say muddy, S&eacute;e,  watching the women washing in the river &mdash; a characteristic sight in France, and  of which there was a good representation in the Academy some three years ago.  How they thump the unfortunate linen with those artistic-looking little flat  hammers! and the way they wring it about must be a caution to any <em>jeune Fran&ccedil;ois</em> contemplating matrimony.  I kept at a respectful distance, fearing they might have a desire to  experimentalise on me, and naturally objecting to have my only coat made the  object of their muscular ablutions.</p>
<p>I reached Avranches at  three o&rsquo;clock, about as tired and footsore as one could wish one&rsquo;s most importunate  tailor &mdash; to whom I dedicate the new Bankruptcy Act &mdash; to be, and am directed to  the H&ocirc;tel de Londres, as being the best in the town, and the one most adapted  to Englishmen. Here I entreat a <em>bonne</em> to bring me a bottle of Bordeaux, which seemed nectar of the choicest &lsquo;brew,&rsquo;  and to which I showed scant mercy. Having thus summarily disposed of my wine, I  am shown to my room &mdash; very near the sky, by the bye; but I recollect B&eacute;ranger,  anl sing,</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Dans un grenier o&ugrave; est  bien &agrave; vingt ans;&rsquo;</p>
<p>and it is not without several  desperate attempts at pushing my head through the sloping roof that I acquired  a perfect knowledge of the charming eccentricities of the architecture. As  evening approaches, I think of dressing, and dive into my knapsack for a pair  of presentable shoes &mdash; &lsquo;tis true they are so much knocked about that Thierry&rsquo;s  self would never recognise them, but that&rsquo;s by the way. O shade of St. Crispin!  As for inserting a foot, I cannot get a toe into them. What am I to do? I stamp  and walk about the room like a peripatetic leopard at the &lsquo;Zoo.&rsquo; Again, the  ceiling reminds me very forcibly that short as I am &mdash; about five feet in very  high heels &mdash; there are still parts of the room inaccessible to persons of  skulls of ordinary thickness. I rush out on the landing, nearly break my neck  on the old hollow oak stairs, and shout frantically at a <em>femme de chambre</em> in the distance. She laughs at my dilemma, but, <em>deu certe</em>, volunteers to buy me a pair  of felt shoes. Ah, &lsquo;women in our hour of need,&rsquo; &amp;c. She expends a modest  five-franc piece thereon, and I am in a position to descend to dinner, which  was very eatable, and, after the manner of the country, presided over by mine  host and wife. Most of the people seemed English; but, ye gods! how that old  Frenchwoman on my left did jabber! Perpetual motion is no myth, after all, it  seems. May earth lie heavy on her! for in no other way can I imagine that jaw  of hers being stopped. Cider makes its appearance at table here, as everywhere  else in Normandy; but, personally, I much prefer admiring it at a distance to  having any more intimate acquaintance with it. There is a good garden behind  the hotel, in which, happy thought! there is an out-of-door cafe, where one  spends the evening quietly and agreeably.</p>
<p>Avranches contains about  6000 inhabitants, and is well built. There is an English colony there &mdash; 600 in  number &mdash; with a club. The English have not yet succeeded in building a church,  and the service was conducted in a mean-looking room like a barn; but it is one  of the attributes of Protestantism, that the plainer and more undecorated the  room, the more solemn and impressive is the service. I cannot say, however,  that a Sunday there is very agreeable, especially in wet weather, with nothing  more interesting to do than watching Normandy pippins gracefully floating down  the gutters and disappearing in the distance. There is a fine Roman Catholic  church building; and the Jardin des Plantes &mdash; the English promenade &mdash; commands  a glorious view of the sea-coast and Mont St. Michel in the distance. To  invalids, or those seeking an economical place of residence, Avranches presents  many charms; for not only is the climate soft and genial, but, standing high as  it does, it has a peculiarly bracing temperature. The cost of living is small;  one lives excellently at the Hotel de Londres for nine or ten francs a day, or  even less; and were a good cigar &mdash; <em>rara  avis</em> in France &mdash; obtainable, the town should be classed by me as A1 at  Lloyd&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This is the head-quarters  for excursions to Mont St. Michel, and a party was made up at the hotel for a  visit to that most interesting relic of medievalism on the following day. When  we descended to breakfast at seven &mdash; an early hour for the hotel &mdash; we found  considerable difficulty in obtaining the slightest thing to eat or drink. The  two <em>bonnes</em>, who were always wanting <em>baksheish</em> &mdash; an Egyptian muleteer is  nothing to them &mdash; and who were not beauties in their line, at last condescended  to give my fellow-travellers some eggs and other <em>objets de luxe</em>; but nothing would they do for me or my appetite. In  vain I appealed to them &mdash; they only laughed; I entreated &mdash; they made cheerful &lsquo;moves;&rsquo;  I swore &mdash; they were deaf as any of those posts for which enthusiastic Scotchmen  are so grateful to one of their native dukes; I complimented them on their  angelic faces and figures &mdash; they relaxed a little; I talked of their pretty  faces, and I got a coffee-cup, but nothing in it. In my despair, I made a <em>razzia</em> on a dish of fruit and another of  maccaroons, which were artistically arranged for the table-d&rsquo; h&ocirc;te breakfast,  and demolished a fearful quantity. This had the desired effect, and they then,  with many grimaces, brought me something more substantial.</p>
<p>We started for Mont St.  Michel at 8.30, and our &lsquo;turn-out&rsquo; was &lsquo;seedy&rsquo; and novel in the extreme; and  such were the charming peculiarities of its mechanism, that only two could sit  inside; so two of us courageously mounted the box-seat by the <em>cocher</em>, a little lithe Frenchman,  good-tempered and witty as Bernal Osborne himself; in fact, he was a veritable  Don Quixote of Jehus, and his performances would have excited the lively  admiration of the Whip Club. He certainly exerted himself to the utmost, and  the street rang with his shrieks and the clattering hoofs. I suppose it is the  orthodox thing to insure one&rsquo;s life; but as it appears a duty, and I always  objected to duty on principle, mine remains uninsured, though had I ever the  vaguest idea that I should have incurred the frightful perils of that  expedition, I would certainly have gone to the nearest office before my  departure from London and taken out a policy. It was truly magnificent! First  on one side, then on the other; now playfully ascending the pavement, now  rapidly disappearing in the gutter. Our cattle, also, were very striking: one  animal was a full-grown horse as big as a dromedary without the hump, the other  was a pony, and they were so harnessed that the poor devil of a horse had all  the work to do. However, as exclaimed the joint sharer with me of the pleasures  of the box, &lsquo;<em>Il faut changer tout cela;</em>&rsquo;  and we made the <em>cocher</em> alter his  arrangements. Another carriage started with us, and the rivalry between the two  Jehus was extreme, occasionally playful, but always abusive, and deprecatory of  each other&rsquo;s &lsquo;turn-outs;&rsquo; the &lsquo;gee-ughs&rsquo; of the one, and the <em>sacr&eacute;s</em> of the other, made the road  lively. We crossed a river at a little village, and then the roads became  execrable; and shortly afterwards we were on the sands. Our Jehu had already  manufactured three whips, and was busily engaged on another, when he quietly  stopped at a wayside inn for ten minutes, to refresh his horses, he said, but I  thought to absorb cider. <em>Apropos</em> of  inns, why is it that they all have a bunch of mistletoe over the door? Is it on  the &lsquo;Good wine needs no bush&rsquo; principle? The aforesaid gentle reader probably  knows, not I. After a jolting, somersault-throwing journey of nearly four  hours, we reached a little hamlet, where the carriage stopped. Here we were met  by a guide, a large bronzed fellow, his face furrowed by fifty winters and  exposure to wind and rain, and not at all a prepossessing-looking <em>sujet</em>, but who had nevertheless been &lsquo;decorated&rsquo;  for saving life. He began, in tones fearfully suggestive of excitement and  terror, with the declaration that it was absolutely impossible to cross the  sands, and that we could never land at Mont St. Michel, as the waves were  raging so fiercely. &lsquo;<em>Ah, l&rsquo;amour de Dieu</em>,&rsquo;  said he, &lsquo;<em>mais ils sont terrifiques!</em>&rsquo;  But ultimately he admitted that we should be able to cross at one o&rsquo;clock, when  the tide would be gone down.</p>
<p>Accordingly we waited on  the causeway, and Mont St. Michel stood grandly out in the distance. It is  situated about six miles S.W. of Avranches, and appears at least twice as large  as St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount in Cornwall. The summit of the tower stands 470 feet  above the Bay of Cancale, and it is strongly fortified. I am not, however,  going to allow my historic Muse to run off into a digression here, and must  refer my reader to <em>Murray</em>, who  furnishes very complete particulars of the vicissitudes of Mont St. Michel. Two  or three of the party made rough sketches <em>pour  passer le temps</em>, and shortly after one we began our passage across the  causeway &mdash; a narrow, artificial ledge of loosely-piled rocks, about a mile in  length, with the sea on one side and quicksands on the other; in fact, as  cheerful a sort of Scylla and Charybdis as one could reasonably desire. Our  guide, <em>malgr&eacute;</em> his appearance and age,  was very gallant to the ladies, and occasionally gathered curious weeds or  flowers for them; and after half an hour&rsquo;s tedious walking, in which Blondin  was completely eclipsed, we reached the island.</p>
<p>A large monastic school  is on the left, and the village at the foot consists of very old houses with  quaint gables and windows, though I know not how the inhabitants &mdash; about 300 in  number &mdash; can obtain their living, a little fishing and carving being the only  industries visible. After lunching at a tumble-down sort of an inn &mdash; where, <em>inter alia</em>, they gave us a sea-weed made  into a pickle, that caused us to make all sorts of wry faces, and our eyes to  water like the hose of a fire-engine or showers in spring &mdash; we went over the  castle. The chapel of St. Michel is interesting, and the ludicrous  representation of the patron saint summarily disposing of a dragon is droll in  the extreme. At the door of the castle our guide left us, having received <em>bakskeish</em> to the tune of five francs a  head. There were several people waiting for admission; the door opened slowly;  a franc a piece was demanded and paid; and we entered a large hall, where  trinkets and souvenirs of Mont St. Michel are sold for the benefit of the monastery.  After purchasing several, a guide showed us over the castle and monastery. The  dungeons, chapels, cloisters, salle des chevaliers, and salle des marechaux are  singularly interesting, and the view from the tower is grand in the extreme. I  noticed that every accessible slate on the roof was covered with a name, and  that the inevitable Jones and Tomkins (stay, I think Tomkins spells his name  with a &lsquo;y&rsquo; now) had been obtaining cheap, if not honourable, immortality by  inditing their noble names and addresses thereon. This was only what might have  been expected from those worthies; but I had always given &lsquo;Mossoo&rsquo; credit for  better taste. It takes two hours to go over the castle, even hurriedly, and one  might conveniently spend a much longer time there. The pillars of the cloisters  are very light and beautiful, and so is the old Norman church, the beauty of  which, however, has been somewhat defaced by restoration. The dungeons are very  numerous, and might, perhaps, have been nice little places in old times for a  petit <em>souper</em>, but are not at all well  furnished at present. There was an ominous-looking hole in the ceiling of one  of them, through which, as in the Pneumatic Railway, one was quietly forced, <em>&agrave; la</em> Amy Robsart in Keniliworthy and not  heard of much afterwards. They must have been very accommodating though, those  old seigneurs, as they built their <em>cachets</em> of all sizes; and I hardly see how such nice little boudoirs, with the use of a  musical chain gratis, and no five quarters&rsquo; assessed taxes to pay, could have  been much objected to.</p>
<p>We drove home, the sands  having become, by the time of our departure, sufficiently firm to permit our  carriages passing over them. The old guide and <em>cocher</em> between them drove us furiously through a stream, and then  quietly deposited us on the quicksands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All out!&rsquo; was the cry,  and indeed it seemed as if some would pass a very <em>mauvais quart d&rsquo;heure</em>. The wheels were over their axles in the  sands, which were swaying to and fro like half a dozen female Shakers when the  spirit is in them &mdash; or on them (I beg their pardon for this slip of the pen) &mdash; and  it was only by dint of great labour on our part, and groaning, swearing, and  praying to St. Michel on that of the guide, that we extricated our vehicle.  Before driving off, however, he put in a claim for more <em>baksheish</em>, protesting at the same time that we should have been  lost but for him. Although we perceived it was a planned affair between him and  our Jehu, and only a ruse to obtain more &lsquo;loot,&rsquo; we yielded gracefully to the  occasion, and having again &lsquo;tipped&rsquo; him, drove off, devoutly hoping that we  should see no more of this old shark of the quicksands. He gave us a profound  bow on our departure, with a sly grin at having experimented so effectually on  the purses of the <em>perfides Anglais</em>. There  was a glorious sunset over the sands, the effect of which was very fine; and  after a long drive &mdash; in which our indefatigable <em>cocher</em> swore terribly, &lsquo;boxed the compass&rsquo; of his saints, called  his steeds affectionately by name (Sophie and Berg&egrave;re), and manufactured an  untold quantity of thongs for the special benefit and edification of our ears  and his horses&rsquo; backs &mdash; we reached Avranches in the evening, very tired, but  much delighted with our excursion, or indeed expedition, as that to Abyssinia  is the only one I can imagine comparable to it.</p>
<p>Intending to leave that  town next morning, we took the precaution of booking our places for Dol by  diligence; but this proved of little advantage, as on going to the &lsquo;station&rsquo;  whence it started, and taking up a position on the <em>banquette</em>, we were coolly informed that we had not booked our  places, and must descend at once. This, however, we naturally refused to do,  being very comfortable where we were, and not feeling inclined to &lsquo;flee to ills  we knew not of.&rsquo; A stormy debate ensued, the diligence people trying to make us  come down, and we as firmly refusing. They had, it seems, been baksheished by  another party of men, and hence tried to bully us out of our places; but &lsquo;Britons  never, never,&rsquo; &amp;c. In vain they showered volumes of abuse on us, and began  to clamber up the diligence, as if to pull us down by force. We remained &lsquo;hermetically  sealed&rsquo; to our seats, and threatened to throw them overboard if they came up.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allons done au mairie,&rsquo;  said the conductor.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Allons,&rsquo; we said, with  apparent courage and determination, but with a vague feeling as to what M. le  Maire would do to us poor devils, and with dim forebodings of everything that  French justice &lsquo;has of the most terrible,&rsquo; our thoughts even reverting to the <em>cachots</em> of Mont St. Michel. Seeing our  determination, however, M. le Conducteur evidently thought it useless to  persevere, and as he already had his bribe in his pocket, and had done all in  his power to oblige his patrons and to satisfy his wretched little conscience,  he desisted, and drove noisily out of Avranches, instead of to &lsquo;la mairie.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;diligences&rsquo; &mdash; surely  so called on the <em>lucus a non</em> principle, as they are terribly slow &mdash; now in use in Normandy are, as a rule,  small and uncomfortable; more like those old vans one sees in remote parts of  England plying between country towns, than the best public conveyance  procurable; but the one that ran to Dol was an exception, and was so large and  roomy that it might have been the Arc de Noe itself, for anything we knew to  the contrary. It was drawn by five horses of Norman breed, who were changed  every five or six miles. By and by the driver relaxed, and he then became very  communicative. His definition of the wretched place under the tarpaulin at the  top of the diligence (where the baggage and passengers who have last arrived  are placed, and to which the horrors of the Middle Passage are nothing) was  very amusing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he, in reply  to our inquiry, &lsquo;e&rsquo;est le salon!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A nice sort of salon  truly; and its inmates dance to a pretty tune, I imagine. How they manage to  exist is a mystery to me; and I never saw the tarpaulin raised without  expecting to find some unhappy victim <em>in  extremis</em>. He was no respecter of persons or priests either, <em>il faut dire</em>, and his remarks on the  portly cures we passed <em>en route</em> were  rather of a sarcastic than complimentary description.</p>
<p>The diligence passed  Pontorson, and we were in Brittany, and already the roads became rougher and  narrower. The houses also are inferior to those in Normandy, and the people are  differently clad. We passed fields of tobacco and crops of saracin, the colour  of which is very brilliant, and from which a kind of bread is made. The  tinkling of the little bells on the horses&rsquo; collars sounds very cheerfully, and  the blue-coloured sheepskins worn on their shoulders give them a picturesque  appearance. The headdresses of the women are very droll, and yet neat and  becoming, although I feel compelled to state that opinion was not shared by my  Abigail, to whom I presented one on my return. At a fair in Dinan I counted no  less than fourteen different styles of cap, each worn &lsquo;with an air,&rsquo; and not  exhibiting that religious horror of soap which Frenchmen generally are reported  to entertain.</p>
<p>The diligence reached Dol  at 12.30. It is a quaint old town in the department of Ille et Vilaine, and was  formerly the seat of a bishopric. The high street is full of picturesque old  tumble-down sort of houses with gables and odd windows, and all sorts of devices  and animals on the escutcheons over the doors. In the church, which is a noble  one, are some exquisite fonts, and during our visit several persons were  sketching parts of its interior. There is a railway from Dol to St. Malo; so we  took the train accordingly, roundly abusing the French system of keeping the  passengers away from the platform until the arrival of the train, and muddling  every one together in a little waiting room, which was filled with a  nondescript, motley set of people. Here was a young Jesuit priest, with his  pale ascetic face rapt in thought, making perhaps a journey to a sick-bed, and  not, after the manner of his order, over supplied with napoleons; he wil  presently enter a third-class carriage. On an opposite bench were two old women,  probably returning from market &mdash; fat, cheerful, and not in the least annoyed at  being quietly sketched, provided the drawings were afterwards submitted to them  for their inspection and admiration. There a portly bourgeois, dreaming of the  rentes, was inspecting the time-table; whilst outside a gay little zouave  sauntered up and down, thinking, it may be, of Lisette or his marshal&rsquo;s baton,  the <em>ne plus ultras</em> of a French  soldier&rsquo;s ambition, when absinthe is unattainable. A bell rings, tickets are  taken, the door is opened, and we take our seats in a second-class carriage,  which was apparently as good as one of the first class in England, and was very  comfortably fitted up, but the train was miserably slow. The scenery on the  road was very fresh and charming; the <em>cantonni&egrave;res</em> enlivened the stations with their signal flags and <em>vivandi&egrave;re</em>-like dresses; and in a couple of hours we reached St.  Malo, which presented a very lively and bustling appearance.</p>
<p>St. Malo is a large  seaport in the department of Ille et Vilaine, and is built on the island of  Aron, which is connected with the mainland by a causeway three-quarters of a  mile in length. It is strongly fortified, and inaccessible on the north side.  The harbour, which is formed by the mouth of the river Rance, and separated  from the open sea by the causeway, is very spacious, and has a depth of water  of forty-five feet at high tide. There is a large floating dock, and an active  trade with America, England, and the Channel Islands. I have never been in  Cologne with its 10,000 smells, but it struck me that St. Malo had as charming  an assortment of odours as one could well desire. They were simply horrible.  The best hotel in the town is the Hotel de la France, the house in which  Chateaubriand was born &mdash; a large quadrangular building, much frequented by  English, and at which we stayed accordingly. The cathedral church contains  several curious relics, and there is a fine picture of St. Francis d&rsquo;Assise in  one of the side chapels. Here also, as in the Chapelle de St. Michel, are  suspended from the roof large models of ships &mdash; votive offerings from devout  sailors and fishermen, and which strongly reminded me of Horace&rsquo;s lines,</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Me tabula sace<br>
  Votiva paries indicat uvida<br>
  Suspendisse potenti<br>
Vestimenta maris Deo&rsquo; &mdash; </p>
<p>in his charming Ode to  Pyrrha.</p>
<p>The bathing at St. Malo  is entirely deprived of all enjoyment, owing to the quantity of clothes one is  made to wear. I was compelled, like Fatima, to put on a pair of the baggiest  trousers and a kind of Garibaldi jacket, fastened by a band at the waist;  between the two one is dragged down in the water like a stone, and indeed, when  I came on the beach, the body of a young ex-officer, who had just been drowned,  was being borne past the bathing-machines, <em>pour  encourager les autres</em>, I suppose.</p>
<p>The ladies that sit about  the machines, watching the bathers airing their latest costumes, are not at all  deficient in &lsquo;chaff,&rsquo; and criticise unmercifully the different eccentricities  of the sporting sirens and portly Gauls. A Frenchman, <em>il faut dire</em>, never seems to enter beyond his ankles, and does not  present a very imposing appearance, being a kind of human breakwater to the  tiniest waves, with strong symptoms of the hydrophobia.</p>
<p>The town is surrounded by  fortified walls, on the top of which there is a promenade. I never see walls of  that kind without thinking of the scenes in the old plays where two or three  heralds, with gorgeous trumpets and any amount of cool impertinence,  deliberately stand underneath and summon the town to surrender, which summons  &lsquo;first citizen&rsquo; invariably objects to obey, whereat flourish of trumpets and a  long parley. In fact, we were discussing this very subject, and I was giving a  very fine representation of the &lsquo;first citizen,&rsquo; with a <em>chiffonnier</em> and an old<em> blanchisseuse</em> below for my heralds, much to the amusement of our party,  when suddenly we heard a fearful torrent of <em>sacr&eacute;-bleus</em> in front of us, and &lsquo;<em>Qui va-l&agrave;?</em>&rsquo; rang  out in the evening air. It was nine o&rsquo;clock, and we were on the walls later  than is the custom, and, it having become dark, we had not perceived the  sentry, who put in an appearance, in a fearful state of excitement, with his  bayonet at the charge, on a level with that part of our bodies which we had  been sedulously refreshing shortly before at <em>table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</em>. I suggested a &lsquo;strategic movement&rsquo; and three paces to  the rear, and prepared to decamp. The little soldier, however, &mdash; he was only  about four feet and an odd inch or two &mdash; swore in the most reckless manner that  he had challenged us twice, and was apparently bent on making the entire party  prisoners, if only to revenge Waterloo; and it was not without much difficulty  that we succeeded in convincing him that we were not there for the purpose of  capturing the forts, or, like crest-shaking Hector, burning the shipping.</p>
<p>In my room at the hotel  was a fine portrait of Chateaubriand. The face gleams with thought and  intelligence, but a certain sharpness about the nose and lower part of the  countenance prevents its being called strictly handsome. The forehead, however,  is high and white, the fine eyes shine brightly and firmly, and masses of dark  chestnut hair are thrown backwards like the mane of a lion. Enthusiasm is  written plainly on every feature, and also that veneration which led him to the  gates of Jerusalem and in his wanderings o&rsquo;er the Holy Land. Such, at least,  seems to me to be a true description of the face of the man who theorised on  revolutions, translated Milton&rsquo;s immortal epic, and upheld so triumphantly in  his Martyrs the doctrines of Christianity. Ah! it was a singular life, was that  of Francois Auguste, Vicomte de Chateaubriand; and yet, if we except his  overweening vanity, how nobly did he bear himself during those long eighty  years! The quiet student, with a religious horror of war, led by his fervent  loyalty into the ranks of the <em>&eacute;migr&eacute;s</em>,  and left for dead in the breach of Thionville; no sooner recovered from his  wrounds than embarking in quest of the North-West Passage &mdash; an enterprise from  which he is only dissuaded by Washington himself; an exile from France during  the chaos of the Revolution, and earning a tutor&rsquo;s scanty livelihood in London;  appointed minister to Switzerland, and resigning his post on the murder of the  Due d&rsquo;Enghien. Add to these the r&ocirc;les of journalist, statesman, and man of  letters, and one is wrapt in admiration at his wondrous versatility. His  married life was not a happy one, for, like Shelley&rsquo;s, it was embittered by the  littlenesses of an uncongenial wife; and he, who of all Frenchmen of his  generation should have had the tender solicitude and affection of a kindred  soul, was doomed to lead a wretched existence with a woman who neither loved  him nor could raise herself to his level. It is St. Malo&rsquo;s greatest honour to  have produced Chateaubriand; and that he loved his seagirt birthplace is shown  by the spot he himself selected for his sepulchre. Pay a pilgrimage to yonder  rock in the bay, and, remembering the pathos and soul of the man, dreaming with  his fantastic and chivalrous nature on the progress and genius of Christianity,  ask yourself whether the author of the <em>G&eacute;nie  du Christianisme</em> belongs to France alone or to humanity.</p>
<p>Having determined to  proceed to Dinan on the following morning, it was peculiarly satisfactory to us  to hear that the steamer had ceased running, and that it would be impossible to  ascend the river Ranee. So, abusing our luck, each other, one another, every  body and thing, we took the boat to Dinard, a small village across the harbour,  and proceeded by road in another of those ornamental carriages which I have  before described. The road presented little that was interesting until we  approached Dinan, where the country became more picturesque. The proprietor of  the H&ocirc;tel de Bretagne, the best in the town, having obligingly drowned himself,  or been drowned, or something of the sort, two days previously, we were  compelled to go to the H&ocirc;tel du Commerce, in the Place Duguesclin, where I made  the acquaintance of an old <em>bonne</em> of  some fifty summers, much inclined to snuff and <em>embonpoint</em>, who was very amusing, and took to the writer in a  manner strongly suggestive of matrimony.</p>
<p>Dinan &mdash; my <em>beau-id&eacute;al</em> of an old town &mdash; is in the  department of the C&ocirc;tes-du-Nord, and is distant about twelve miles south-west  of St. Malo. It is situated on the sides of a hill, near the left bank of the  Ranee, which flows in a deep valley beneath the town, and has a population of  8000. There is an active trade, as the river is navigable at high water for  small steamboats up to the town, and the canal of Ille et Ranee continues the  water communication as far as Rennes, the capital of Brittany. Shoes, hats,  flannels, and sail-cloth are made in Dinan, and there are also beetroot and  salt works. The old ramparts are still extant, and the <em>portes</em> are very curious. The castle is at present used as a prison,  and is interesting on account of its having been formerly used as a residence  by Anne of Brittany. The cathedral church of St. Sauveur is one of the best in  Brittany, and part of the exterior dates from the eleventh century, and is very  beautiful &mdash; the carving and fret-work over the main entrance being exquisite.  We noticed inside a flat stone, on which was an eagle and the inscription &lsquo;Guerqui&rsquo;  (or something very similar). Du Guesclin&rsquo;s heart is said to be buried  underneath, his body having been buried at St. Denis. The English residents in  the town number over 1000, and have a church and club of their own, and occupy  a separate <em>quartier</em>. Everything is  extremely economical, even more so than at Avranches, which, coupled with the  climate, facility of access, and historical associations, probably accounts for  the presence of so many English families.</p>
<p>We were fortunate enough  to be in Dinan on a market-day, and to see a cattle-fair in the Place  Duguesclin, which, owing to the quaintness of the costumes and vehicles, the  appearance of the rough-looking cattle and rougher men, the rickety booths, and  head-dresses of every shape and size, was novel and droll in the extreme. The <em>paysans</em> and their families began  flocking in by hundreds, with their cattle, from seven in the morning, and the  fair was at its height at noon.</p>
<p>It was curious to see the  earnestness with which the <em>paysannes</em> would descant on the respective merits of each animal, and would grow quite  eloquent on the superior merits of their own beasts. When there were no buyers,  they would go on knitting, chattering like magpies, but losing no time. The  men, however, seemed to do but little; and O what pigs! tall, lanky, salmon-coloured  brutes, with backs arched like Apollo&rsquo;s bow. (pleasant comparison!), and which  trot along the road much faster than the diligence. At two P.M. the people  began returning home, and the road was covered with miscellaneous traps and  conveyances, which totally eclipsed those seen on the road to Epsom on a  Derby-day.</p>
<p>We remained two days at  Dinan, though one could easily spend a fortnight in that charming old town,  with its churches, its <em>place</em>, its <em>portes</em>, its old houses and crooked  break-neek streets &mdash; that recalled the <em>facilis  descensus Averni</em> &mdash; its villas and surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>The next morning my  companions proceeded southwards to see the old druidical remains at Camac, and  I returned to St. Malo, where I took the steamer to St. Heliers, having spent a  thoroughly enjoyable week. To any one of my readers who may be in Jersey, and  who may become slightly <em>ennuy&eacute;</em>, I can  safely recommend this little tour of mine round the Bay of Cancale, for which a  week is amply sufficient. It will not cost him more than five or six pounds,  and he will be amply repaid by the charming scenery of the country, its old  ruins and associations, and the costumes and habits of the people.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="ARailwayAdventure"></a>A Railway Adventure</strong></h2>
<p>A lawyer&rsquo;s office in  summer time is by no means an agreeable place of sojourn. There is a prevailing  sense of dryness and a lack of verdure. The only greenness perceptible is in  the conduct of the clients, and in the green &lsquo;ferret&rsquo; with which the sheets of  parchment are bound together. Pastoral influences, too, are altogether wanting.  There are no &lsquo;bleating flocks,&rsquo; nor anything to suggest their existence, unless  it be the skins which have been stripped from their backs, and converted into  the aforesaid parchment, in which sheep&rsquo;s clothing the ravening wolves of the  profession are wont to disguise their meaning, if not themselves; the only  fountains are ink fountains; and there are no trees, except those genealogical  growths which flourish under the culture of Garter and Clarencieux.</p>
<p>The office of Messrs.  Catchem and Eatem, of Spiders Inn, formed no exception to the general truth of  this description. I had been their bond-slave or managing clerk for some time,  and was seated in my prison one fine afternoon during the month of June 186-,  bewailing my hard lot in the intervals of labour, in a somewhat depressed frame  of mind. I rather suspect that I must have fallen into a doze. I had been  engaged for some time in making out a bill of costs against some unfortunate  debtor, whom we had been grinding in our legal mill; and I remember that I had  been speculating upon the remarkable analogy existing between the bestial and  human creations, and reflecting how precisely the tigers, wolves, snakes, and  wasps in the former are repeated in the lawyers, bill-discounters, doctors, and  old maids of the latter dispensation. The vastness of the subject was, I  suppose, too much for me, and I had taken refuge from the problem in sleep,  when I was suddenly aroused by the deep bass voice of my venerable superior Mr.  Catchem.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Hopkins,&rsquo; said the  voice, &lsquo;I find that I shall be unable to go down to Dedborough to complete that  purchase of Mr. Ponsonby&rsquo;s, and therefore you will have to go. The appointment  for completion is at ten o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning, so that you must leave  town by the 5.15 train to-morrow afternoon, and sleep at Dedborough, ready for  the next morning. The purchase money is paid into the London branch of Messrs.  Musgrave&rsquo;s bank at Dedborough; you will therefore only have to take a cheque  with you for the amount, and get it cashed in the morning ready for the  settlement. Come into my room to-morrow about four, and I will give you  instructions. I am going across the square to Squeezem and Scrunchem&rsquo;s; back in  half an hour.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Exit Mr. Catchem, and up  jumps Mr. Hopkins and executes a war dance of a jubilant and triumphant  description, indicative of his delight at the prospect before him. The sparrow  outside my window flew away in great disorder, evidently astonished at the  indecorum of my behaviour, and only accustomed to the gravity of demeanour  becoming an inn of court. Invigorated by this little interlude, I returned to  my bill of costs, thinking that after all old Catchem was perhaps not quite so  black as I had painted him. The point of view is everything, and seen through  the medium of my country excursion, even he appeared to lose several shades of  darkness.</p>
<p>Business over for the  day, I walked home to my lodgings in Lavender-crescent, Camberwell, still in the  same state of exhilaration. &lsquo;Jane,&rsquo; said I, bursting into the passage, &lsquo;I am  going into the country for a few days. Will you come with me?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Lor, Mr. Hopkins, sir,&rsquo;  said Jane, &lsquo;how can I? I couldn&rsquo;t leave missus and the &rsquo;ouse, even if you was  kind enough to take me. Is anything the matter, sir? O, don&rsquo;t, sir, please! You  promised me you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; And Jane leaves my room with her cheeks considerably  rouged, and a conviction, I think, that I have been taking something besides  exercise.</p>
<p>After tea I packed a  carpet-bag ready for my country excursion; and then, in order to get over the  intervening time, I lighted the pipe of peace, and sat myself down in my  easy-cliair to read Lady Sappho Godiva&rsquo;s delightful <em>FIeshworms</em>, and to admire the gorgeous upholstery which is therein  so minutely described, and, above all, the succulent morbidezza of the female  portraits. I certainly found her &lsquo;carnations,&rsquo; as painters call them,  deliciously warm and juicy, and the scene-painting all that could be desired.</p>
<p>In the morning I arrayed  myself with a degree of care befitting the importance of the occasion, and  departed joyfully for town, having first taken an affectionate leave of Jane,  whose faint &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; sounded, I thought, much more like &lsquo;Do!&rsquo; The day dragged through  at last, and punctually at four P.M. I knocked at Mr. Catchem&rsquo;s green-baize  door, and was desired to enter.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the conveyance,  Mr. Hopkins,&rsquo; said that gentleman, &lsquo;which you will see properly executed before  you pay the purchase money; and take care that all the title-deeds shown in the  abstract are handed over to you at the same time. The money, as I told you, is  at Messrs. Musgrave&rsquo;s bank in Dedborough, and here is a cheque for the amount,  4060<em>l</em>. I cannot cross the cheque  because you will have to pay in cash; so mind, if you please, that you are very  careful of the cheque. The appointment for completion is at Mr. Upton&rsquo;s office  in Dedborough, on Thursday. This 10<em>l</em>.  note is for your own expenses, for which you will account to me on your return.  Be very careful, if you please, and lose no time in getting off. Good-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I returned my venerable  superior&rsquo;s adieu with great alacrity, and shaking the dust of the office off my  feet and my clothes, I hailed a passing hansom, and was soon gleefully bowling  off to the Great Northern Railway. In my private capacity I need hardly say  that I did not ride much in cabs; but on occasions like the present I felt that  I represented the firm of C. and E., and was determined that their dignity and  official status should suffer no abatement at my hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Two bob, captain,  please,&rsquo; said the jarvey when I got out. I observe, by the way, that cabmen  generally salute gentlemen of doubtful exterior as &lsquo;captain,&rsquo; which I suppose  is intended as a delicate compliment. I paid him at once &lsquo;like a gentleman,&rsquo; as  he was good enough to assure me; for though I knew it was double his fare, I  never haggle about the price when I am spending my employers&rsquo; money. It is a  kind of spoiling the Egyptians, in which, as in all revenge, there is, to use  Lord Bacon&rsquo;s phrase, a sort of wild justice.</p>
<p>Acting upon the same  principle, I took a first-class ticket to Dedborough; and ensconced myself in  the most comfortable carriage I could find. I first paid a visit to the  book-stall, to provide myself with some literature for possible contingencies.  I made choice of a magazine containing a story called &lsquo;Gustavus Snooks&rsquo;s Will,&rsquo;  which promised some interest to a lawyer; as I have generally observed that  such histories contain some very remarkable legal incidents, confirmatory of  the old classical axiom, that it is wiser in the cobbler to stick to his last.  King Solomon&rsquo;s dictum that there is nothing new under the sun is conclusively  disproved by the history in question; for in it I find the executors of a will  signing the will as well as the testator, which I affirm to be an entire  novelty.</p>
<p>I was lost in admiration  at the boldness of this innovation, when the door of the carriage was opened,  and a lady entered in deep mourning and seated herself in an opposite division;  soon afterwards we got under way, and were joyfully rattling out of the smoke  and noise of the great Babylon into the pure air of the country. My companion,  though still apparently a mere girl, was dressed in widow&rsquo;s weeds, or rather in  that most becoming modification of them which is now prevalent, and in which  one single beading of white crape edging the black bonnet does duty for the  hideous old widow&rsquo;s cap. So much as I could see of her she was very pretty. Her  complexion was perfectly pale, and she had large deep-gray eyes which darkened  in colour at the outer edge of the iris, where it merged into the deep black  fringe of the eyelash. Her mouth was hidden by the broad band of double crape  which edged her veil; but her lovely brown hair was displayed by her mite of a  bonnet, and was coiled in massive lustrous wreaths behind her beautiful head.  She made no affectation of deep grief; but her eyes had that curious benumbed  appearance which you sometimes see in an animal which is stricken with some  great pain.</p>
<p>Sorrow always appears to  me so sacred a thing, that I felt no inclination to make any effort towards the  usual acquaintance of fellow-travellers, and accordingly devoted myself to my  book. But some trifling courtesy broke the ice between us, and it seemed that  my companion was anxious to obtain some information about her journey. Was I  going to Dedborough? and what time would the train get there? Could I tell her  of any hotel at which she could stay for a short time? Would it be <em>very</em> expensive? She apologised for  asking these questions by saying that she had lived for many years in France,  and was entirely ignorant of England and its ways. Her beautiful eyes filled  with tears as she spoke of France, and I could not help feeling for one so young  who had suffered so much.</p>
<p>I gave her all the  information I could upon the subject, and in return she told me some  particulars of her story. She had lately come from Tours, where she had lost  her husband after a year&rsquo;s marriage; and being left almost penniless, her  friends had persuaded her to seek for a situation as governess in England,  instead of, as she would have preferred, in France. This place she had at  length found, as she hoped, in the family of a gentleman living near  Dedborough; she was to sleep at that town for one night, and to be fetched to  the Cedars, her new home, in the morning. She feared an English hotel would be  very costly after the French ones to which she was accustomed. Would there be a  salon in which ladies could sit, or must she take her meal in her bedroom? All  this she asked in the most natural, innocent, childish manner imaginable; and I  could not help thinking what a very child she was, and how totally unfit to  travel in England alone, with her confiding winning way and pretty half-foreign  accent. I told her in reply that I intended to have a sitting-room for my own  use (which, by the way, was a <em>very</em> sudden intention on my part), and that if she would brighten it with her  presence during her evening meal, it would give me very sincere pleasure. She  didn&rsquo;t know. <em>Might</em> she do so? Would  it be quite <em>en r&egrave;gle</em> for a lady to do  so? If she <em>really</em> might &mdash; I assured  her that she need not be uneasy on that score, and I felt really glad that it  was in my power to act in some sort as her protector. Duty is delightful when  it assumes the form of taking a lovely girl-widow under one&rsquo;s protecting wing.</p>
<p>As I stepped on to the  platform at Dedborough, an inspector on duty inquired if my name were Hopkins.  Wondering what prompted the question, I replied that it was; and having farther  made me give the address of my firm in London, he handed me a telegram which  had passed my train upon the wires, and which told me that the purchase would  not be completed till the Friday morning, as the deeds were not ready for  delivery to the purchaser. &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; said I to myself &mdash; &lsquo;so much the  better. I shall be delighted to have another day in the country. I will go over  and see this old place, which Mr. Ponsonby has bought.&rsquo; I have a special  passion for old houses in the country. A good part of my boyhood was passed at  one such, in &lsquo;pleasant Hertford shire,&rsquo; and in memory of it I love them all.  Meanwhile I placed my companion and her travelling-bag in a cab, and drove with  her to the Blue Crocodile, which was the house in Dedborough that I had been  advised to stay at.</p>
<p>I found the hotel one of  the pleasant, old-fashioned, comfortable houses &mdash; now, alas, becoming scarcer  every year &mdash; in which the buxom landlady receives one as an old friend and  caters for one&rsquo;s comfort with kind solicitude. A great contrast to the &lsquo;lady-manager&rsquo; of the modern monster hotel, who sits in an inaccessible office, and is far  too grand to take any interest in the welfare of the guests, whom she knows  only as &lsquo;No. 537,&rsquo;or whatever the numeral in which their identity is lost may  chance to be. My companion would have nothing but tea, and, seated at the  tea-table, she looked more beautiful and child-like than ever.</p>
<p>It was a lovely summer  evening, soft and balmy, and sitting at an open window before a garden full of  roses and mignonette, the air that filled the room was laden with their  fragrance. The sun went down in glorious state &mdash; a crimson ball into a purple  sea of mist. A river ran below the bottom of the garden, reflecting as in a glass  the gorgeous colours of the western sky, whilst the plash of an occasional boat  broke from time to time the stillness of the night. There was a piano in our  room, and as I sat musing in the gloaming, my companion seated herself before  it, and in absent mood struck a few chords. Gradually she seemed moved to more  effort, and in a few minutes the plaintive strains of Mozart&rsquo;s &lsquo;<em>Pro peccatis</em>&rsquo; rose upon the air. The  melancholy solemnity of the prayer seemed to harmonise with her state of  sorrow, and she sang the words with heart-felt pathos. Like Rubini, she  appeared to have &lsquo;tears in her voice,&rsquo; which breathed the very spirit of  passionate sorrow. I sat entranced in a dream of bliss. Each element of beauty  seemed to heighten and enhance the rest &mdash; music never sounds so sweetly as at  such a time; &mdash; and as the voice of the singer &mdash; herself almost unseen &mdash; trembled  forth into a flood of melody, I wished that I could sit and listen to it for  ever. What a life, I thought, encompassed by such sights and sounds and fragrance,  compared to the wretched drudgery of my own!</p>
<p>All too soon it came to  an end. My fellow-traveller soon closed the piano, and with a simple &lsquo;goodnight,&rsquo;  left me to build what castles I might in her absence. She had left her  handkerchief on the ground. I picked it up and pressed it to my lips, and as I  did so I saw a beautifully embroidered &lsquo;Marie &rsquo; in one corner of it, which I  thought a charming name. I kept it as long as I dared, and then rang for the  chambermaid to take it up to her. I sat for some time longer; but the glory was  departed, and I was soon glad to follow her example, and to take what  remembrance I could of my pleasure into dreamland with me.</p>
<p>In the morning I  breakfasted alone, Madame de Fontanges (for that I found was her name) sending  me her compliments, and saying that she preferred to take her coffee in her own  room. I determined to make the most of my day; but first I placed my  pocket-book, containing the important cheque, in my travelling-bag; and having  carefully locked it, I locked the bag itself into one of the drawers of the  wardrobe in my bedroom, and placed the key in my pocket. I had been debating  with myself as to the safest manner of keeping this cheque, which was rather a  cloud upon my happiness, and I deemed this the safest manner of taking care of  it. Having got this matter off my mind, I applied myself vigorously to the  breakfast before me, revelling in the golden butter and creamy milk of the  country, after the manufactured articles of Lavender-crescent, where the butter  was made of fat, and the milk chiefly supplied by the cow with the iron tail.  Nor did I forget the more substantial items of eggs and bacon, deeming it  advisable, with Major Dalgetty, to provender the garrison against possible  sieges.</p>
<p>It was a charming morning,  and as I started off to walk to &lsquo;Foxholes,&rsquo; the place which our client had  purchased, I couldn&rsquo;t help devoutly wishing that my lines had fallen in such  pleasant places as the country around Dedborough. No one enjoys the country  like a Cockney, who is imprisoned in the smoke and stir of London. Every flower  and blade of grass appeals to him with a force and vividness which the rustic  never feels; and if he chance to have passed the happy hours of childhood  amidst such scenes, they touch a chord in his heart which vibrates with  delight. I found Foxholes was six or seven miles from Dedborough; so that I  had abundant time to walk leisurely onwards, resting from time to time to drink  more deeply of the pure joys around me, and wandering from the pathway into any  wood which took my fancy by the roadside.</p>
<p>By mid-day I reached the  entrance to the house. It was a white gate, under tall over-arching elms,  making a deep shade after the glare of the sun. Farther on, the entrance road  ran under some high pine-trees, whose deep black foliage made a still darker  shade, broken and enlivened by the crimson gleams of their boles. Beside this  wood spread a large sheet of water, all overgrown with superb water-lilies,  whose leaves lay almost blistering in the hot sun, forming a dark green  flooring, from which the bloom-cups of ivory and gold sprang up in rich  luxuriance; whilst water-spiders skated about on the surface from the beds of  jointed reeds which fringed the sides of the lakelet, and great dragon-flies,  of bronze and blue and crimson, hung suspended over it on gauzy wings,  motionless for a moment, and then darting off with lightning speed. I was  speculating upon the capabilities of the place for fishing, when a vain young  frog, boastful of his strength and desiring to exhibit it, sprang from the bank  some three feet into the water, and again gathering up his legs, was plunging  with glee through the bright green waters, when lo! the reeds by the bank were  suddenly cleft asunder &mdash; a dark body shot out from the side &mdash; there was a flash  of a great silver-green side under the surface and a &lsquo;swirl&rsquo; upon the top &mdash; and  poor froggy had performed his last acrobatic feat, and his place would know him  no more.</p>
<p>The grass around the  water was deep in soft moss, into which my feet sank at every step. Thousands  of grasshoppers &mdash; dark brown, drab, and pale sea-green &mdash; were singing their  joyful song, leaping high into the air, and falling heels-over-head in every  direction. In the pine-trees was a wood-pigeon uttering &lsquo;its long love-ditty,&rsquo;  most melancholy but most beautiful of country sounds; proclaiming its undying  passion for its wife sitting close by upon her eggs, and stopping from time to  time with a frightened sudden &lsquo;hoo,&rsquo; when I walked upon the odorous  pine-needles beneath its nest.</p>
<p>The house was an old  red-brick building, not of the bright red which tells of Dutch William and Sir  John Vanbrugh; but of an earlier date, stained with age and lichens, and  overgrown with vines and jasmine. The old entrance-door looked strong enough to  resist a siege, studded all over with thick square iron bosses. I knocked, and  was admitted into the great stone-flagged hall, a huge square room with a  quadrangular black oaken staircase rising from it. The doors of entrance into  the various rooms downstairs were all of dark mahogany, with the handles as  high up as one&rsquo;s shoulder, and the fireplaces were the old-fashioned &lsquo;dogs&rsquo; for  wood-fires. A delightful place, I thought. How I should like to spend my days  there! I left the house with lingering regret, after staying as long as I  decently could, and wandered out again towards the great fruit-garden, passing  on my way a charming summer pavilion, built of the same red brick, through whose  open door swallows were wheeling in and out, to and from their nests built high  up the walls against the ceiling, twittering with joy (as well they might), and  with their indigo-blue backs glistening in the bright sunshine. From the peas  in the fruit-garden rose a flight of blackbirds and thrushes, whilst the harsh  scream of a brilliant jay resounded through the summer air. What a paradise I  thought it! I sat myself down upon a rustic seat close to a pond full of great  fat carp, and watched them gasping at the surface of the water, and sucking  down any unwary flies that came within their reach.</p>
<p>I was glad to rest after  my walk, and I know of no place of rest so delightful as a garden:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Some flowrets of Eden we  still inherit,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&mdash; and I do verily believe, for myself, that  these paradisaical flowers flourish most freely in country gardens. Sitting as  I did, breathing the sweet fresh country air, soothed by the comfortable sounds  from a rookery which stood behind the house, inhaling the fragrance of the masses  of bright flowers and basking in the blessed sun, my thoughts reverted to that  happy time in the history of the world when a garden contained the whole of the  human race; before the flaming sword had driven them forth, and the waving of  that magic brand had drawn thorns and thistles out of the teeming soil. Having  thoroughly rested myself, I set out leisurely upon my return journey, stopping  to lunch at a roadside inn, which I had remarked some half-mile back, upon the  way. I had most thoroughly enjoyed my excursion so far; but such short holidays  are clouded rather painfully by a sense of their evanescence.</p>
<p>I got back to Dedborough  late in the afternoon, indulging a vague hope that my charming fellow-traveller  might not have yet left; but alas! I was doomed to disappointment, for my  friend the waiter informed me with cheerful alacrity that Madame de Fontanges  had left in her friend&rsquo;s carriage directly after lunch, leaving for me a  message of compliments and grateful thanks. <em>Sic  transit!</em></p>
<p>My first care was to  adjourn to my bedroom, to see after the safety of the all-important cheque. All  safe I found it, and immediately transferred the pocket-book containing it to  the breast-pocket of my coat, as I did not intend to leave the house again  until I went to attend the appointment for completion of the purchase. My  sitting-room, I fancied, looked very desolate; but there was no help for it,  and after dinner I was glad to adjourn to the coffee-room to lessen the feeling  of loneliness.</p>
<p>Next morning I started  off to complete the business which had brought me down; but first I called at  Messrs. Musgrave&rsquo;s bank to cash the cheque, as we could not ask the vendor to  take our cheque. On presenting the cheque at the counter, I fancied the cashier  looked somewhat surprised, but that I attributed to the largeness of the amount  for which it was drawn. After asking me one or two questions about it, he took  the cheque into the private room of one of the partners, and in a few moments  he returned and requested me to walk into Mr. Musgrave&rsquo;s room, as he wished to  speak to me about it. I found the partner holding the cheque in his hand, and  looking rather grave, and I began to fear that the bank was in a bad way, and  that they were unable to meet the payment. The banker desired his clerk to  leave; and having carefully closed the door, he asked me some questions as to  the drawer of the cheque &mdash; where I had received it, and so on; which, of  course, I had no difficulty in answering. Still he did not seem satisfied, and  continued to question me in a manner which was fast making me angry, when the  door opened, and a quiet gentlemanly-looking man of middle age entered the room  and wished Mr. Musgrave &lsquo;good-morning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is the young man,&rsquo;  said the banker to him, and proceeded to repeat my answers to the new-comer. By  this time I was getting very uneasy, and asked Mr. Musgrave somewhat  impatiently what was wrong about the cheque.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, young man,&rsquo; said  the new-comer quietly, &lsquo;the fact is the genuine cheque was presented yesterday  and cashed, and this is a forgery, for which I shall have to detain you until  we have communicated with the drawer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I was utterly stunned at  this statement, and declared vehemently that it was impossible; that the cheque  had never left my possession since it was handed over to me; and that the whole  story was some villanous conspiracy to ruin me, or to avoid paying the money.  The banker seemed somewhat nettled at this remark, and was beginning an angry  reply, when the stranger stopped him, saying the less said the better. He then  said that he was the superintendent of police at Dedborough, and that I must  consider myself in custody; but if I would give my word to go quietly with him,  no fuss or scandal need be made about it. I felt like a person in a dream.  Could it really be possible that I was arrested on a charge of forgery? My head  swam at the thought, and I sank fainting on to a chair behind me. Mr. Musgrave,  who seemed a humane, fatherly sort of man, appeared to be greatly shocked at  the whole affair, and persuaded my custodian to let me have some wine before we  left, which brought back my scattered senses. He then told me that the cheque  had been presented about two o&rsquo;clock on the previous day, and had been paid in  notes all but the odd sixty pounds, which was cashed in gold. The person  presenting it was a youngish man with moustache and dark hair, who had answered  with perfect correctness several questions about my employers which had been  put to him to test his identity.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, young man,&rsquo;  said the police-officer, &lsquo;the less you say the better, because, you know, it  will only be used against you. I must trouble you to come with me; but first I  must take you back to your hotel to search your room.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time I was so  entirely crushed by the whole affair, that I seemed to have lost even the power  of speech, and had he proposed to cut off my head there and then, I think I  should hardly have offered any objection. I walked mechanically by his side  through the streets of Dedborough, but they did not look like the same streets  which I had passed through full of hope and confidence but a short half-hour  before. I fancied that every one we met looked askance at me, and that the  guilt of the crime which I had not committed was branded like Cain&rsquo;s upon my  brow. Was it really only half an hour since I had been free? It seemed an age  ago. We passed a beggar &mdash; a wretched half-starved object clad in dirty rags &mdash; with  pallid face and eyes, out of which all hope had long since died; and how  devoutly I longed to change places with him, if I could but have shaken off the  incubus which oppressed me! All my old life rose in review before me. Where  were the troubles which I had thought so heavy? Could it be possible that I had  been unhappy ever before? The office in Spiders Inn seemed to me now to have  been the very gate of heaven, and Lavender-crescent a dream of bliss. And Jane,  &mdash; would she too hear of me as a forger? My mind pictured her reading the  account of my committal in the <em>Standard</em>,  which her mistress indulged in, and which generally found its way into the  kitchen after Mrs. Johnson had done with it upstairs. The very paragraph swam  before my eyes. &lsquo;The prisoner was a young man of shabby-genteel exterior, and  appeared to feel his position very acutely. In answer to the worthy magistrate  he protested his innocence of the charge against him,&rsquo; &amp;c. &amp;c., in the  stereotyped phraseology which meets our eyes from day to day, and which enables  one half of the world to gloat over the miseries of the other, and to thank <em>their</em> God that they are &lsquo;not as this  publican.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No. 21, sir; yes, sir,  certainly. This way, if you please, Mr. Bracelet,&rsquo; said the obsequious  chambermaid of the Crocodile to the great man who had me in his gripe,  preceding us upstairs to my bedroom. <em>My  bedroom!</em> Where would be my <em>next</em> bedroom? I wondered. &lsquo;This is the room, if you please, sir,&rsquo; as she threw open  the door of No. 21.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thanks, my dear; that&rsquo;ll  do &mdash; you needn&rsquo;t stay,&rsquo; to the girl, whose eyes were dilating with wonder to  see what was coming next.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This your bag, young man?  Unlock it, please. Ah! clean collar, shaving-tackle, nightgown, socks &mdash; quite  so. Anything in this pocket?</p>
<p>I <em>thought</em> so; silent matches, wax-candle, skeleton keys, blank  cheques. Yes, yes; <em>now</em> we shall do.  We&rsquo;ll take this handy little bag with us, please.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Was that <em>my</em> bag? Was I dreaming? I rubbed my eyes  with a vague hope that I might be in an accursed nightmare; but no! my vision  remained the same, and there stood Mr. Superintendent Bracelet, prepared to  attend me, with my bag in his hand, and a complacent comfortable smile upon his  face. By this time my faculty of surprise was utterly exhausted; and if he had  again thrust his hand into my bag and pulled forth a snake or a dodo, it would  have appeared to me the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>I begged him to grant me  one favour, which was to telegraph to my employers in London before making any  charge before a magistrate; and this he agreed to do. Meanwhile, he conducted  me to the police-station in Dedborough, and left me to my own meditations, which  were sorrowful enough. I flung myself down on the bench of my cell, hardly  caring what should come next. I must have fallen, I suppose, into a troubled  sleep, for it was past three o&rsquo;clock when I was aroused by some one entering  the room, and I found myself face to face with Mr. Catchem. His arrival gave me  courage to tell my story minutely from the moment of my leaving London; and I  was greatly relieved to find that he seemed to give credit to it, and that his  anxiety was much more to recover the money than to bring home the crime to me.</p>
<p>He undertook to be  responsible for my appearance, if required; and employed Mr. Bracelet to see if  he could gain any trace of my too fascinating fellow-traveller, whom he made me  describe most minutely. We could learn nothing of any such person at Dedborough  station; but on using the wires, we found that a lady answering to her  description, with a gentleman, had taken tickets for Swindon by the 3.5 train  of the previous day, from a station on a loop-line ten miles across the country  from Dedborough. We of course proceeded by the first train to Swindon, and  there again we got scent of the supposed fugitive as having alighted there and  taken the first train across to Liverpool. This was hopeful news to me, and I  breathed a sigh of relief at the possibility of success. No time was lost in  following up the trail; and by ten o&rsquo;clock that night we saw the forest of  masts of the great western port tapering skywards out of the smoke and mist.</p>
<p>We learned that the  American steamer Albatross had gone out with the flood-tide two hours before,  and drove in hot haste to the offices of the company; but it was past  business-hours, and the office was closed. On we went still &mdash; found the  lodgings of the cash-clerk, and hunted him from them to a caf&eacute;-chantant in the  town, where he was vigorously applauding an imitation of Mademoiselle  Schneider&rsquo;s Bulotte in <em>Barbe-Bleu</em>.  Rather sulky at first at the interruption, we found means to mollify him, and &mdash; </p>
<p>Yes, there were a lady  and gentleman, who had secured berths only that morning &mdash; didn&rsquo;t seem  particular whereabouts in the vessel, so that they could go.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Widow?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, the lady was  certainly not a widow. Young, pretty, and dressed in colours &mdash; blue, he  thought. Gentleman tall, dark, with moustache. The name, he<em> thought</em>, was Colonel and Mrs. White, but couldn&rsquo;t be sure till he  saw his book.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they pay in notes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, in gold; because he  remembered thinking it strange that they should pay all gold. At nine o&rsquo;clock  in the morning the offices would be open, but he would be there, say, by 8.30.</p>
<p>This payment in gold was  what we feared, and I began to suspect that, after all, they would slip through  our fingers. The only thing to do was to search all through the hotels of the  place, in the vague hope of finding their lair and getting some farther clue;  but it was already past twelve, and this must be postponed till the morning. We  accordingly adjourned to the Royal Swan for the night, Mr. Bracelet kindly  locking me into my room &mdash; just for form&rsquo;s sake, as he considerately observed.  For hours I could not close my eyes; but at last I fell into a confused sort of  slumber, in which I saw that gentleman in widow&rsquo;s weeds singing the <em>Stabat Mater</em>, whilst the venerable Catchem,  in Bulotte&rsquo;s high Norman cap and clanking <em>sabots</em>,  danced an outrageous <em>cancan</em>, kicking  up before and behind like Ole Joe, with marvellous agility.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, Mr.  Bracelet sought the assistance of the local bloodhounds, with whose aid we  commenced a systematic visitation of all the hotels in the place, each one  taking a certain district. We met at luncheon to report progress &mdash; but, alas!  there was nothing to report. No trace of our game could be hit upon, and I  began to fear that we must have overrun the scent. One coffee-house of doubtful  repute near the quay still remained to be explored; and here we found that a  lady and gentleman <em>had</em> slept on the  night in question.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Did they pay their bill  with a note?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not they &mdash; no such luck.  The bill were only 7<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>., and the gent paid that out of a half  squid. But what might be the matter, if not making too bold?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;matter&rsquo; was soon  explained, and I fancied from the woman&rsquo;s manner she was keeping something back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, what might it be  worth to you to get hold o&rsquo; some trace on &rsquo;em &mdash; say such a thing as a hankercher,  now?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;One pound &mdash; two well, five  pounds, if it turned out to be a genuine article.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certingly, the lady had  left one under her pillow &mdash; and a real beauty it was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A real beauty indeed! It  was the very handkerchief, with the embroidered &lsquo;Marie&rsquo; in the corner, which I  had seen Madame de Fontanges use at Dedborourrh. My heart leaped with delight  to see that we had again hit the trail. How I blessed the woman for having kept  it back as an addendum to her &lsquo;little bill&rsquo;!</p>
<p>Mr. Bracelet lost no time  in working the wires of the cable, and desiring his brethren in New York to  board the steamer before she touched land, and secure our friends, sending them  back by the first return packet. And the lightning soon flashed back their  reply to assure us of their readiness to do so. I went back with my chief to  the Royal Swan, worn out with the excitement, and glad to rest my weary limbs;  but, before doing so, I humbly thanked the God of all mercy for my escape from  the net which had been spread for me.</p>
<p>In less than four weeks&rsquo;  time the fugitives were brought back from New York, and safely deposited in the  prison at Dedborough, and then the whole affair was explained.</p>
<p>A clerk of Messrs. C.  &amp; E.&rsquo;s had been leaving their employ just about the time of my ill-fated  journey; but as it was in pursuance of the usual notice, it excited no  suspicion. This lad (for he was but eighteen) had seen Marie de Fontanges,  whose real name was Mary Fountain, at the Royal Pandemonium Music-hall in &mdash; street,  where she was engaged as a singer. and here the siren had sung away the poor  boy&rsquo;s heart and senses. He fell madly in love with her, and wanted to marry  her; but Miss Fountain did not exactly see the use of that, unless he had  something to offer. She allowed him, however, to visit her at her lodging near  Leicester-square, and here she riveted his fetters more tightly, and gradually  moulded him to her will. He told her everything about the office-affairs; and  she it was who put it into his head to forge a copy of the cheque, and to  supply her with all necessary details for carrying out her little scheme. They  were then to have sailed for the New World together; but of course she took  care to give him the slip, and went away with a former lover of her own class,  who, in the intervals of his professional engagements, did also a little  burglary; and he it was who had supplied her with the necessary tools for  opening my bag, &amp;c., and with the skeleton-keys which she had deposited  therein, in order to cast suspicion upon me until she had made good her escape.</p>
<p>All but about 100<em>l</em>. of the money was recovered; the three  culprits were tried and convicted at the next assizes held at Dedborough, the  heaviest sentence falling upon Mary Fountain, as she was the prime mover in the  whole affair. My employers treated me with more kindness than I expected; but  of course I could not expect to remain in their service.</p>
<p>I went back sadly to  Lavender-crescent, to pack up my effects and seek a cheaper lodging; and there  Jane, dear good Jane, womanlike spread the aegis of her protecting care over me  &mdash; married me almost in spite of myself, spent all her little hoard in keeping  us afloat till better days; and at length by the rhetoric of love persuaded her  uncle, who is a market-gardener at Battersea, to try me as his book-keeper and  salesman, which I have now been for nearly three years. The fresh air and  freedom of the life suits me much better than a lawyer&rsquo;s office; and although  my cousin Robert, who is a tallow-chandler&rsquo;s shopman, says I have married  beneath me, I never regret the step which I have taken. </p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Part 1</strong></h3>
<p>I cannot imagine why, at  the very hottest time of the year, people should suddenly become frantic to go  to the sea. Mad dogs dread the water. With human beings, madness takes the  opposite form; they rush to it. Men, women, and children &mdash; babies, dogs, cats,  canaries, and bullfinches &mdash; all, poor things, panting and puffing, hunting  after boxes, bags, and hampers &mdash; all examining railway tourist tables &mdash; all  wildly rushing to Llandudno, Whitby, Torquay, or Ilfracombe, are daily spectacles  at every railway station during June, July, and August. Those who are cooped up  in small houses in small towns, or who have little leisure for holiday, one can  understand requiring a change; but why persons in large comfortable houses  should make up their minds to leave those said houses for a small lodging, with  lodging-house furniture and lodging-house food &mdash; their own gardens just in the  short stage of perfection which modern ideas allow to gardens, with fruit  ripening for thrushes, blackbirds, and servants, pretending too, and deceiving  themselves into the belief, that they leave all this for enjoyment &mdash; is a  mystery which requires a &lsquo;very clever fellah&rsquo; to solve.</p>
<p>One reason, and that is  how I, Lady Chester, come to leave my comfortable home, is, that at certain  periods I am informed my house is ever so dirty, and the white washers must be  had in. My housekeeper has been with me many years. After a certain number of  years, I have heard, a good servant becomes either mistress or slave. I suppose  mine is what is called a most valuable servant. I should not have the courage  to part with her; but it would require a very lively imagination at full  stretch to call her a slave. Well, so it happens, I have to turn out of my own  house &mdash; my comfortable everything. I have no garden, for I live in London, but  I am very particular, and like everything nice around me: at certain times I am  compelled to leave all, and go forth into the wide world.</p>
<p>When possible, I pay  visits to my numerous friends. Twice I have been compelled to go to the sea, as  it is called. I tried to change the time of my Hegira, so that it might not  clash with my friends&rsquo; engagements; but the look of amazement and virtuous  indignation expressed in my factotum&rsquo;s face quite defeated me. I felt I was lowered  in her eyes, and ought to be in my own, for imagining it possible I could be  allowed to stay in a house that had not been upset for nearly six months. I do  wish I dared return suddenly and see what they are doing in my absence. I have  heard of such things as parties given in the drawing-rooms, when the lady of  the house is absent: and I should like to see; but I must have some good excuse  ready before venturing on such a step, or I must get my niece Gertrude to do it  for me: her nerves are much stronger than mine. If I live and am ever turned  out again, I really will devise some plan for a sudden return; perhaps, though,  I might find, &lsquo;Where ignorance is bliss, &rsquo;tis folly to be wise.&rsquo; But my  ignorance is <em>not</em> bliss, that&rsquo;s the  thing. If some great man were to lose his wife and think of my factotum as her  successor, I might manage better with a new one, I have no doubt. However, I am  away now, and I must forget Priggins, and what they call &lsquo;enjoy&rsquo; myself in the  sea-breezes. This is the second time it has been my lot, since I was left a  widow, to spend six weeks at the seaside. Once I went to Whitby; now I am at  Ilfracombe.</p>
<p>I have a dear sister the  very opposite of myself. I am a widow; she has a busy physician husband. I  knew, when Sir Thomas proposed to me, I should be very foolish to refuse him,  and so we were married. Hester fell violently in love with Dr. Bevan during a  severe illness she had; he saved her life, and marry him she would, though he  was only a doctor in a country town, red-brick house at the end of the street.  I never had any children; Hester has five, one girl and four boys. Sir Thomas  left me very well off; Hester is not at all rich. Her way of going through the  world is what I call misery in many respects, yet she has not the faintest idea  of comparing her lot to mine. She actually thinks hers is so superior in every  way!</p>
<p>Dear Hester delights in  her periodical change to the seaside. Nothing could for a moment persuade her  it is not the height of enjoyment to others as well as to herself; and so  twice, finding I had nowhere to turn to, she has sent me a few lines and  entreated me to join them in their annual trip somewhere.</p>
<p class="note">DEAREST GERTRUDE, &mdash; By  your letter to Gerty I find that old vixen of yours is turning you out again.  Do come with us. I am so looking forward to the delicious sea-breezes. O, the  sound and the sight and the smell of the sea! Isn&rsquo;t it a thing to dream of for  months? Have you any preference, dear? Do tell me, and you must come. I do so  enjoy being together; it almost makes one feel young again. Don&rsquo;t you remember  our first visit to the sea &mdash; some odious mouth of a river in Lancashire, dear  mother took us to &mdash; and the bonnets we had to wear there, because of our  complexions! How I wished I had none! Poke bonnets a yard long nearly, and  lined with dark-green muslin, and a deep curtain all round our necks, like the  valance to a bed! I should like to ask Gerty to wear one! Dear mother, how she  hated the sea, but how I do love it! and then you like seeing my boys, and  Gerty will be so pleased to have you as a companion; for dearest Henry takes up  all my attention during our holiday, he is so busy and hard-worked. I see so  little of him at home. We start on Thursday, and thought of Whitby, but say if  you prefer any other place. I shall take a nice round of beef well salted, and  half a Cheshire cheese; so we can&rsquo;t starve. You won&rsquo;t want your footman, will  you? Just as you like; but I think it so delightful to rough it a little, and  leave servants and cares behind. The lodging-house people are accustomed to  wait at table, and we will take a house not too large for ourselves, and then  you will be quite comfortable. Last year there were four other parties in the  house with us; so the poor cook had five breakfasts, five early dinners, and  five late dinners to get ready, and all at different hours!</p>
<p class="note">I will take care we do  not do that again if you are with us. Now don&rsquo;t send me a refusal, for love of  our early days, dearest Gertrude. I have told you nothing of our boys. Harry is  working hard at Rugby; George is distinguishing himself at Wellington; dear  little Ned has passed into the Britannia, and looks quite lovely in his pretty  uniform; and Tom says he would rather be aunt Gertrude&rsquo;s page than anything  else, for it is so jolly to have all those buttons, and nothing to do but keep  himself neat and wash Cuba, and she looks like a fat white sheep when clean; so  please remember this when you are changing your page! Gerty sends her best  love, and says you <em>must</em> come. So good-bye, dear. &mdash; Your own sister, HESTER  BEVAN.</p>
<p>This was the sort of  letter which determined me both times to do as Hester asked me &mdash; the wrong side  of forty makes one cling to the friends of one&rsquo;s early days. How impossible it  is to make friendships of any depth except in buoyant youth! and in after years  who or what can make up for one&rsquo;s own sister? Her marriage had rather  interfered with our great affection and intimacy at first; but, after all,  Hester, was a happier woman in her married life than I had been; and Dr. Bevan  was so clever and so good, I sometimes thought she had done better for herself  than many who had made finer marriages. Well, I wrote to Hester:</p>
<p class="note">MY DEAREST SISTER, &mdash; I  will join you. Let it be Whitby, if you like. I have never been there. It will  do as well as any other place, I daresay. Please take me a south bedroom, and  an east room for my maid, that she may be up in good time. Dear Hester, I do  not think it possible for me to keep well if I were to touch Cheshire cheese. I  don&rsquo;t know what my doctor would say to such a thing. I will have a piece of  Parmesan packed, and some truffles. You may not be able to get such things  there. Reindeer tongues are delicate for breakfast if we feel very hungry with  the change of air. Do you think there will be spring-mattresses on all the beds?  I like one, but I must have a thin feather-bed over it. My bed must not face  the window, the light is so injurious to one&rsquo;s eyes. Of course there must be a  hanging-wardrobe in my room, though I will tell Goode she must not take many  dresses. I shall sleep at York on Thursday, and join you the day after, dear.  Much love to my dear namesake. &mdash; Your own sister, GERTRUDE CHESTER.</p>
<p class="note">P. S. &mdash; I always take a  little rum-and-milk in the morning; there will be no difficulty in continuing  this, I daresay. I think it has been of benefit to me, and Goode thinks so too.  &mdash; Good-bye again.</p>
<p class="note">P.S. No. 2. &mdash; I will bring  my own <em>duvet</em> as you may not find them  in furnished houses.</p>
<p>I slept at York and went  on next day. Certainly the country for the last two hours is very wild and  beautiful, and I was rejoicing too that the sea would not always be in sight,  for even when the train stopped at Whitby no ocean was visible. Dr. Bevan and  Gerty waiting for me &mdash; how pleasant it is at the end of a journey to find a  loving face looking out for you! &mdash; and as I had no footman, they were doubly  welcome. It was wonderful how well I did without Alfred, though; I really  hardly missed him. I do not think he is a good travelling servant, though  Priggins says I am hard to please; for the last time I went to stay at  Blenheim, he was fast asleep when the train stopped, and Goode was looking  after the luggage, so I had to find him myself. It was most ridiculous having  to awake my own footman, when he ought to have been looking after me, and a  horrid Irish porter said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my lady, except  for the honour of the thing, you might as well be without him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Goode managed  wonderfully. She is a very active servant, quite different from my others, and  I hope I may keep her, for Hester found her for me; but Priggins thinks her  rather vulgar, she is so willing to help any one, instead of &lsquo;keeping herself  to herself,&rsquo; as she calls it. My dear niece collected all my wrap and my  travelling-bag, whilst Dr. Bevan escorted me to the fly that was waiting, and  we drove off; her father remaining to take charge of Goode and my boxes. Up the  steep hill and narrow streets, Flowergate and Baxtergate, curious names like  the old streets in Chester; jet shops everywhere, looking as if the whole town  were in mourning; then through a long modern street and up to the Crescent; and  there was the sea &mdash; I must say it was a grand sight. And there was Hester with  her dear arms round my neck, so happy to be together again.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t, it lovely,&rsquo; she  said, &lsquo;this grand beautiful ocean? Nothing between us and <em>Norroway</em>, as the boatmen say. Come to your room, dear Gertrude.  Gerty has undertaken to make it as comfy as possible, only in a lodging one  can&rsquo;t have all home comforts, you know; but we are so enjoying it. This is our  sitting-room, really so nice and clean, I thought we were quite fortunate in  securing these rooms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was the  sitting-room. The carpet was green; there was a scarlet-and-black table-cover;  the curtains were scarlet, with black braid; there were two card-tables folded  up against the walls, a black horsehair couch, and a cupboard with some frightful  china in it between the windows; the chairs were covered with blue damask. I  took it all in at a glance, and felt as if I could not live a month in the  room, unless we were always sitting down to hide the blue chairs from the green  carpet. But Gerty said, &lsquo;This is your own corner, dear aunty;&rsquo; and in the bow  window, turned away from the sea and facing the old church and St. Hilda, were  a comfortable chair and small table; and many pleasant hours I spent there. It  was really beautiful, and Gerty is such a darling, that when I forgot all my  home worries and Mrs. Priggins, I began to enjoy myself more than I could have  thought possible. Dear Hester gave me the best room over the sitting-room, she  and Dr. Bevan squeezing into the smaller bedroom and tiniest dressing-room I  ever saw; but she never minds anything of that sort, and besides, she had a  view of the sea from that room, which was more enjoyment than having the best  room that ever was built. I was rather knocked up by my journey, and glad to  rest a short time in my room: Gerty brought me a cup of tea, so much nicer than  what Priggins gives me. She is looking so pretty, dear child. The next day  Hester said, &lsquo;We dine at two, Gertrude, and have severe tea at eight.&rsquo; I looked  forward with dread to a two-o&rsquo;clock dinner. I must say I like the smallest  possible dishes cooked in the best possible way. I like my little silver bowl  of soup and my tiny filets of sole; lamb-cutlets with some button mushrooms  (Dr. Thonick does not forbid <em>them</em>), a  grouse or a partridge when in season, an omelette with the slightest soup&ccedil;on of  Parmesan, and no sweets, unless it is a meringue or two served with a little cr&ecirc;me  &agrave; la Vanille, and slightly iced. I knew dear Hester never had the faintest idea  how delicate my digestion was; she never could understand it, never had more  stomach than a sea-anemone herself, and never minded more than they do what she  put into it. However, Gerty and I had a little stroll about twelve o&rsquo;clock, and  I began to feel more inclined to eat when two struck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What excellent mutton, Hester!&rsquo;  I said. &lsquo;I never have a leg of mutton at home &mdash; Priggins always says she fears  the smell would upset me; but this is excellent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So glad, dear Gertrude,&rsquo;  said my sister &mdash; &lsquo;let me give you a tiny bit more before I sit down.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had been helping the  whole family, Dr. Bevan included; she never let him have the trouble of  carving at home; and as, he used to say, she thought she did it so much better  than he did, he never interfered. The boys are so good &mdash; fine handsome fellows  too &mdash; and she manages them wonderfully. There was such a capital tart &mdash; two  indeed. I never thought of touching such a thing, but Hester insisted:</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Gertrude, don&rsquo;t  you remember how we used to eat Paradise tart together? I had it on purpose for  your first day. You must have some; far better than all those things Dr.  Thonick gives you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such a dinner as dear  Hester had herself! Enough to surprise a sea-anemone even. &lsquo;Too hot for roast  mutton,&rsquo; she said; so Harry brought her a piece of cheese &mdash; <em>Cheshire</em> too &mdash; then Paradise tart, and  then a large plate of strawberries. &lsquo;None the worse, dear?&rsquo; I said gently; and  she really had no recollection of anything extraordinary. Wonderful how very  differently our internal works must be arranged! I think hers must be those of  a large kitchen-clock, and mine intended for a Geneva watch set in a bracelet.  But I have done with our dinners; I will not mention the subject again.</p>
<p>Gerty took me down to the  quay, and in a few days she actually persuaded me to get into a boat, and  through the harbour out into the open sea. It really was enjoyable, and I got  interested in the tales she extracted from the old boatman. The mouth of the  harbour is very narrow, with a lighthouse on each side, and often the man said  the waves washed over them. I did not believe him <em>then</em>, but I put a trifle into the lifeboat collecting-box when we  landed. He told us of one vessel being in distress, and the lifeboat going out  to it, but the crew had taken to their boat, which on this shore is almost  always fatal; there were eleven hammocks ready to turn into, but the only sound  in the vessel was a canary-bird singing in the cabin: not a man was ever seen  alive.</p>
<p>Another schooner came on  the rocks under Church Hill, and the crew were landed in safety by a rope  thrown to them, the captain standing by his wife and baby, fastening the rope  round each man as he was launched through the waves. When he put it round his  wife and himself, his hands shook so, the knot was insecure; he was holding the  baby tight in his one arm. The knot gave way just as they neared the shore. He  threw his child to the hundred hands stretched out to help them, and sank with  his wife into the hungry waters, crushed between the vessel and the rocks. The  baby lived, and is now a married woman.</p>
<p>Then there was Carter&rsquo;s  large dog to see &mdash; a beautiful black retriever, which had come ashore in Robin  Hood&rsquo;s Bay from some vessel. For three days, poor fellow, he would let no one  touch him, and refused food, wandering about on the sands, occasionally  swimming out a little distance, and then returning with a low howl, stretching  himself on the sand, as if watching for his master to come to shore. Poor  fellow, that master will never be seen again till the sea gives up her dead.  After three days he was worn out, and came to Carter for food and water, and  then jumped into his boat: he has been his faithful companion ever since. And  there was Flamborough Head to hear about too: the sailors said many a ship had  been kept off the rocks by the warning cries of the sea-birds, which they  listened for and could hear above the winds and waves; but that now so many <em>gentlemen</em> (?) went to shoot them, there  would soon be none left; so Mr. Sykes is none too soon in bringing forward his  Sea-Bird Preservation Bill, as I shall tell him when I meet him in London next  year. And Gerty and I read <em>Marmion</em> together, sitting among the ruins of St. Hilda&rsquo;s Abbey; I never enjoyed it so  much before.</p>
<p>I said I dropped a trifle  into the lifeboat collecting-box, little thinking of the romance I was to witness  in the midst of an awful storm. I wished myself back in my own snug house, with  Priggins even. To begin at the beginning. Dr. Bevan said the glass was falling;  and it fell steadily for twenty-four hours; the sky also threatening &lsquo;very  dirty,&rsquo; as the boatmen said, when we walked home by the quay. At night the wind  rose, and the rain! &mdash; I never heard anything like the rattling of the rain  against the windows and the howling of the wind; and next morning the sea! &mdash; quite  terrible it was. We stood watching from the windows wave after wave rolling in  and breaking over the lower lighthouse. Carter had only told us the truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo; &ldquo;The waves of the sea are  mighty, and rage horribly,&rdquo; &rsquo; said poor Hester, with her arm round little Ned;  but he looked up into her face with his great blue eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go on, mother,&rsquo; he said;  &lsquo;go on, finish the verse: &ldquo;but yet the Lord, who dwelleth on high, is  mightier.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the rest of it, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, my boy,&rsquo; said Dr.  Bevan; &lsquo;a fine old sailor said three hundred years ago, &ldquo;Heaven is as near by  sea as He is by land.&rdquo; Three hundred years have made no difference; unchanged  and unchangeable, He is the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The rain ceased about  noon, but the wind seemed rather to increase than diminish. Soon after four,  Dr. Bevan and the boys came in and told us there was a vessel in danger,  nearing the port. &lsquo;She is too much shattered to put out into the open sea, and  the boatmen say she never will be able to get round the rocks into the harbour,  such a night as this.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will the lifeboat be  out, father?&rsquo; said Gerty. &lsquo;I must go and see if it is. I have always wanted to  see one go out. You will take me, won&rsquo;t you, and aunt Gertrude too? &mdash; By the  bye, aunty, do you remember your poor Goode comes from a village near this? She  has been so anxious all day about the storm; I&rsquo;ll go and tell her of this  ship.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Away went Gertrude, and  in a few minutes returned.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Father,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;Goode  is so anxious; she says, could you find out the names of the men who are going  in the lifeboat? I think,&rsquo; and Gerty smiled for a moment, &lsquo;she is terribly  anxious about some of them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Kind Dr. Bevan went out  again, and little Ned insisted on going too.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll put on my uniform,  father, and then they&rsquo;ll be sure to answer all your questions, you know, when  they see I belong to the navy. &mdash; May I, mother?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, darling,&rsquo; said  Hester, and the tears came into her eyes, though we were more inclined to laugh  at the child rushing away to put on this beloved uniform, which he was only  permitted to wear on Sundays until his knickerbockers were all worn out.</p>
<p>Thanks, <em>of course</em>, to Ned and his uniform, Dr.  Bevan soon returned with a list of the names, which Gerty brought to Goode  whilst she was in my room. She was very nervous, and the tears were in her  eyes. I thought something was wrong in the morning, for she forgot to give me a  handkerchief, and positively was putting my cap on the wrong way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does your father belong  to the lifeboat?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, my lady,&rsquo;  she said, and turned away with shaking hands to leave the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at the list and  tell me,&rsquo; I said; and Gerty, dear child, actually put her arm round her, and  helped her to read the names.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, thank you, Miss  Bevan,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;thank you, my lardy. No, he&rsquo;s not down for it. I am so much  obliged to you, Miss Bevan. Can I do anything more, my lady?&rsquo; And left the room  without waiting for my answer.</p>
<p>Gerty smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear aunt, I&rsquo;m sure  it is not her father&rsquo;s name she expected to see, though you so kindly suggested  her respected parent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dearest Gerty, do you  think it possible she should have a lifeboat <em>lover!</em> I never thought of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was nearly seven, when  numbers of people passed the house. The lifeboat was ordered out, the vessel  showing signals of distress; all were rushing down to see, and we followed. The  wind had suddenly ceased, but the sea was the same awful sight; the spray,  dashed from the rocks, reached as far as the Terrace houses. There were  hundreds of people present, all helping to draw the great lifeboat on its  carriage out of the shed where it was kept. There were thirteen men standing  separate, watching the progress of the lifeboat to the pier.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the crew,&rsquo; said  Dr. Bevan, pointing to them.</p>
<p>Suddenly a tall fine-looking  young man pushed his way rapidly through the crowd and joined the thirteen.  There were some hurried words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had a good five miles  to come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I started as soon as I heard any talk of the boat being  wanted.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, my lad,&rsquo; said the  man he addressed, &lsquo;I thought you might not turn up, so I took your place for  you; but it&rsquo;s your right and you to go, there&rsquo;s no doubt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank you kindly, uncle,&rsquo;  said the young fellow; &lsquo;I am main glad to be in time. Take my coat, will ye,  and here&rsquo;s my watch. I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; been sorely vexed if I&rsquo;d been too late; you&rsquo;ve a  many more to look after than me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve had my life,  and yours is but beginning. Charlie,&rsquo; the uncle said, taking the young man&rsquo;s  coat and putting his watch into his own pocket. &lsquo;Dunno be rash now. I&rsquo;ll give  it to your mother, I s&rsquo;pose, if so be as &mdash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, give it to mother;  there&rsquo;s nobody else cares about me,&rsquo; Charlie said bitterly.</p>
<p>The elder man had no time  to answer. Just at that moment there was a scream from the hill above us, and a  woman ran wildly down through them all. They all made way for her, and straight  on she came to where the thirteen, the lifeboat crew, were standing, close to  us. Good gracious, it was my maid! I could scarcely believe my own eyes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Charlie, Charlie!&rsquo; she  shrieked, &lsquo;you&rsquo;ll not go! What should you go for? What&rsquo;s the ship to you? O, my  lady, tell him not to!&rsquo; and then she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Charlie&rsquo;s face looked  radiant instead of sorrowful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve not  forgotten me, my darlin&rsquo;,&rsquo; he said. He took her in his arms for a moment. &lsquo;I  thought you had clean forgotten me and taken up with somebody ever so grand in  London.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t think that,  Charlie,&rsquo; she said, sobbing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I did, though; but I&rsquo;ll  never think it again, never.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you&rsquo;ll not go in  that boat, Charlie?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I must, Mary dear,&rsquo; he  said, quite grave and determined. &lsquo;If they drownded, I&rsquo;d have their blood on me  else. God bless you! Kiss me, there&rsquo;s a good girl; they&rsquo;re off?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was in the boat, waved  his hand once, and, amidst cheers and sobs, away they pulled. Gertrude stood  with the tears in her eyes waving her handkerchief, and I felt strangely  inclined to cry too. I never saw such a scene before; and my poor little Goode  clinging to Gerty, trying to watch the boat, and then hiding her face when a  wave seemed to swallow them up. It was dreadful. They mounted on the crest of  the wave, and a loud hurrah rang from the crowd. Again they were lost, and not  a sound was uttered until she was seen once more, and then the cheers  redoubled. They saved the poor crew, and came back all safe; but we went home  before their return, for it was more than we could bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, Miss Bevan, please  ask my lady to forgive me; I don&rsquo;t know how to look my lady in the face again,&rsquo;  I overheard poor Goode say. It is so strange for servants to show their  feelings, one is apt to forget they have any.</p>
<p>But why was it my lot to  go to Whitby and then to have a storm; and, above all things, to have a maid  who had a lover; and not only that, but a lifeboat lover? Why did it not happen  to Lady Verney or Miss Kavanagh, or some one who could have made a good story  out of it, and not to me, who can only write down just what happened &mdash; and to a  person, like myself, with delicate nerves, to whom excitement is prejudicial?  And yet, would you believe it, when I returned to town, Dr. Thonick said my  pulse was stronger, and that I was all the better for his prescription.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which?&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, my dear lady, did I  not send you to Whitby, the finest air in the world?&rsquo;</p>
<p>How extraordinary! I only  went on Hester&rsquo;s account. He must have been thinking of somebody else.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Part 2</strong></h3>
<p>Now that is all I have to  say about Whitby. It happened two years ago. This summer Hester asked me again,  and I joined them at Ilfracombe.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear aunt,&rsquo; said  Gertrude, the first evening, &lsquo;come and sit in the little balcony, and I will  tell you all about everything you can see. Ned and I have been out boating ever  since we arrived, and the boatmen tell us everything. I delight in the  boatmen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Tell me one thing, Gerty  &mdash; is there a lifeboat?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I should think so,&rsquo; she  answered, laughing. &lsquo;My dearest aunt, it&rsquo;s an awful coast &mdash; quite lovely, but  terrible for ships. She was out last September twice. They saved the crew of  one vessel, but the other foundered just before they reached her. Now look  opposite &mdash; that pretty little hill.&rsquo; (&lsquo;With the little chapel on the top, my  dear?&rsquo;) &lsquo;Yes, it <em>was</em> a chapel, St.  Nicholas&rsquo; Chapel, where the fishermen always went to say their prayers before  going out in their boats; but they made the little tower into a lighthouse, and  the nave into a cottage for the light-houseman &mdash; shameful, <em>I</em> call it!</p>
<p>&lsquo;That grand hill to the  right, nearly four hundred feet high, is Hillsborough Cliff, and between us and  Hillsborough is Rapparee Cove, where some Spanish gold ships went ashore &mdash; they  sometimes find doubloons even now washed up by the tide. And beyond  Hillsborough is Hele Bay and Watermouth Caves; we <em>must</em> go there, we can row through them at high water; and farther  on is Hangman&rsquo;s Hill, called so from a man who stole a sheep there; he got over  a gate with the sheep on his back; the creature struggled, and he had not  strength to pull it over, so was hanged by the weight of it. Lovely coast, dear  aunt, with the most beautiful little bays and coves all along, only intended  for the mermaids; for nothing but a bird can possibly get to them except in a  boat. To the left hand, about seven miles off, is Morte Bay, where so many  ships are wrecked: the sunken rocks go out so far, and there is no lighthouse;  and then Bideford Bay and Clovelly are about twenty miles off; you read of them  in <em>Westward Ho</em>; and Lundy Island  quite plain on a clear day. That is Tenby opposite; and now I am as good as a  guide-book, don&rsquo;t you think?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A great deal better,  dear Gerty. But you are looking very thin and pale &mdash; where is your pretty  colour gone, my dear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She had plenty of it that  moment, but I did very much want to question her a little. She had had a most  excellent offer; one she might well have accepted had she been my daughter  instead of Hester&rsquo;s: and positively she had refused it, for the sake of a Mr.  Alan Wingfield, the tall rector of a small rectory, with what she called a  lovely little church, that Mr. Gilbert Scott would go down on his knees to look  at. So foolish of her! How could they live on three hundred pounds a year, with  choir and schools and old women and almshouses, and coals for the old people in  winter, and treats for the young people in summer, may-poles and harvest-homes  all the year round?</p>
<p>That was how this Mr.  Alan Wingfield lived now, and he said he could not give it up; and her father said,  with all his sons he could not allow her more than fifty pounds a year; and so  her mother said they must wait, and not see too much of each other, but have  patience. They had been exceedingly foolish, <em>I</em> thought, and I was rather put out by the whole affair. My advice  had never been asked; but I resolved to give Gertrude a little of it as we sat  together on the cliffs one fine day, looking out on the sea, which was smooth  as glass.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;I  always like going straight to my point. My dear, what in the world made you  refuse Sir William?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t like him, aunt  Gertrude.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A regular young lady&rsquo;s  answer, Gertrude&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;it was a most desirable thing for you. You would  have had everything you could wish for: you could have helped on your brothers,  you know. I cannot understand it at all.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll explain it at once,&rsquo;  she said composedly. &lsquo;He was forty and I am nineteen; very ugly and  disagreeable; and he made so sure I must say yes, that I was rather pleased to  say no. Besides, Alan Wingfield likes me and I like him, so there was an end to  it at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, as  severely as I could, &lsquo;I think this rectory business a very foolish thing  altogether. You cannot marry him. He may be very good and delightful, but there  is hardly a girl in the county that would have refused Sir William. His  diamonds are beautiful; I have seen his first wife wear them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;They were always kept at  the Bank, and whenever she was allowed to wear them, Sir William watched her as  a cat does a mouse, so afraid she might lose some.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sir James never let me  keep my jewels at home either,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;he was so afraid of thieves. But,  Gerty, think of the gardens and the carriages and horses Sir William has.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And, my dear aunt,  perhaps you don&rsquo;t know he is frantic if the horses are kept waiting a minute,  and no one is allowed to cut flowers but himself or the head-gardener.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, my dear, Sir James  was very particular about his horses, and I remember getting into trouble too.  I picked an orchid that had never flowered in England before. Of course I did  not know; but I never shall forget his face when he saw it in my hair that  evening, and I thought I looked so nice; and he had asked Mr. Bateman, the  great authority upon orchids, to come and look at it: it was not long after we  married, and it <em>was</em> provoking. And  when Mr. Bateman came next day &mdash; O, dear me, I never shall forget it!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Gertrude, &lsquo;I  think I would rather have a ring or a bracelet I could wear every day in peace  than a box full at the Bank; and I think a basket-carriage and a pretty pony  with a long tail, that you can tie up at a gate, more fun than a fine carriage  and those terribly precious horses; and I think too, though I am very fond of  flowers, that one can have as much enjoyment in one&rsquo;s roses and mignonette and  sweet-peas as great ladies have in their great gardens, with a great gardener  always after them, not allowing them to pick this or move that. Mother has been  very happy always,&rsquo; she added, &lsquo;though we are not at all rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Would any one believe it?  Quite forgetting I ought to contradict her, as I was on Sir William&rsquo;s side, I  was stupid enough to say, &lsquo;My dear child, to tell the truth I think your  mother&rsquo;s married life much happier than mine was.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m so very glad, dear  aunt, and I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll like Alan when you see him far better than Sir  William; and we are both young enough to wait a little. He is wonderfully  clever too, aunt Gertrude; he did something quite out of the way at Oxford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Positively Gerty  persuaded me to go out fishing! We were constantly boating and exploring the  beautiful coast, and I felt better and stronger than I had done for long; so we  went out fishing &mdash; it was the best way of enjoying the sea-breezes. We had what  I thought at the time a little adventure. It was this. We went down beyond the  Torrs one afternoon, cast anchor, and began to fish. Gertrude caught a great  many, and so did our boatman: they were very anxious I should catch some, but  they would not come to my line at all. Davie looked at the sky and said it was  very dirty, and looked threatening for a bad night. There were a good many  boats out near us, fishing too, and a great many small schooners and other  vessels going up and down the Channel. One of these passing called out, there  was a vessel coming up wanted a pilot. The boat nearest us belonged to old  Williams, who has all the lobster-pots. Gerty and I went one day to see him  haul them up; imagine my amazement at seeing dark-blue creatures spotted with  Bismark brown! &lsquo;O,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;London lobsters are scarlet,not blue.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said  Gerty, laughing, &lsquo;and London chickens carry their livers under their wings; but  they don&rsquo;t do that elsewhere.&rsquo; Well, old Williams began winding up his lines,  and Gerty asked if he were a pilot.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O yes,&rsquo; said Davie, &lsquo;and  so am I.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is he going to the  vessel?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Maybe, and I&rsquo;d like to  go too.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What will they give  you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, ten shillings or  thereabouts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear aunt,&rsquo; said  Gertrude, &lsquo;do let us go?&rsquo; So the lines were pulled in and the anchor hauled up,  and away we went, as hard as Davie could pull. Just as we started, a  sailing-boat started too. We had no sails, and she gained on us; but the tide  was in our favour, and Davie a strong young fellow, and we went through the  water wonderfully fast. There was the vessel down below Lee Bay, keeping well  out in the Channel. Then Gertrude offered to take an oar, and Davie gladly  accepted her help, for she can pull exceedingly well; but the other boat kept  drawing nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is quite exciting,  aunty, is it not? I feel as if we were pursued by pirates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t speak of  pirates in the Bristol Channel; what would Mr. Childers say?&rsquo;</p>
<p>We actually won the race.  We went close up to the vessel; she was the William Pitt, from Cardiff to  Jersey, heavily laden with coals; so the master was afraid to go out, as the  weather looked so threatening, but after all she would not come into harbour,  so Davie did not get his ten shillings. She threw us a rope, and towed us up,  anchoring for the night under Hillsborough Cliffs. We had a gale that night and  a thunderstorm; next morning was lovely, and the William Pitt went on her way.</p>
<p>On Sunday we were rather  late going to church. We could not see the clergymen from our seat near the  door; but when the Litany began, Gertrude, who was next me, gave a great jump,  and then got very red, kneeling very devoutly and hiding her face till it was  finished. It was Alan Wingfield who read this part of the service. He found us  out, and came in the afternoon: he had only arrived the evening before, and  knowing the vicar, had offered to help him. They walked together to the evening  service. He is very good-looking, I must say. But only think, she might have  had diamonds!</p>
<p>And now I must tell what  made me first think of writing down these little events; but for the following  adventure, I perhaps never should have done so.</p>
<p>Gertrude wished to take  me to the Watermouth Caves, to search for anemones and other wonders of the  deep; so she settled we should drive there, as we could only find them at low  water, and at low water it was not pleasant going in a boat, as the tide was  against us the whole way. We set off at two o&rsquo;clock one Thursday afternoon,  driving past the little village of Hele, then through &lsquo;Squire Bassett&rsquo;s&rsquo;  property, to the gate of one of his fields, which opens out into wild cliffs,  tracts of fern, and low-growing oaks. Telling the driver we should be an hour,  and leaving the carriage to wait for us, we started across the field; but  Gerty, finding it hot, went back to the carriage and put in her Algerian bernouse.  It was a wide-striped blue-and-white one. &lsquo;I hope the man will take care of  it,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for <em>he</em> gave it me:&rsquo;  the he being Alan of course.</p>
<p>It was fortunate for us  that he <em>had</em> given it. Well, we walked  across the short dry turf, near a little stream, which was almost hidden by the  masses of fern, large willow herb, and reeds growing on its banks, till we came  to a fence and rail, the entrance to the little wood which led to the caves,  down a very steep path. A lark was singing so beautifully over our heads as we  walked along. When we reached the fence, Gertrude said, &lsquo;There was a keeper  here the first time I came; but I know my way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Each with a basket for  collecting our treasures, which were to be the commencement of an aquarium,  holding on by the branches, we went down through the little wood, by the  half-formed steps and steep narrow path, till we found ourselves on dry sand  and pebbles, with the long natural tunnel before us. It was a wonderful sight;  the rocks hanging overhead in arches, and through the last arch a glimpse of  the sea was visible, green as an emerald. It was quite low water. There was a  small <em>brook</em>, if I may so call it,  between us and the large stones and boulders covered with sea-weed beyond;  masses of them, one after the other, all shapes and sizes, as far as we could  see.</p>
<p>Gerty jumped lightly over  the little stream &mdash; so clear, we saw every pebble &mdash; and holding my hand, I did  the same, and we found ourselves on the rocks, inside the caves. The novelty  of the scene and the wonderful stillness were delightful. There was really no  sound: nothing but &lsquo;the water lapping on the crags&rsquo; below us, and an occasional  shrill cry of a seagull. We went on and on, in wonder and admiration, before  commencing our search for anemones. When we began, they were so beautiful, we  were quite engrossed, and time never occurred to either of us, nor tide either.  They wait for no man, and they waited not for us. We found hermit crabs,  anemones of every shade of red &mdash; brown ones with bright blue spots, which  Gertrude called turquoise necklaces they could always wear, and never send to  be shut up in the Bank. We were really quite in a new life of enjoyment, and  after my life in London, it was enough to take up my thoughts. We were at the  far end of the caves &mdash; in fact outside them, and on the rocks that form the  narrow straits at its entrance, looking at the wide sea and beautiful coast &mdash; when  Gerty suddenly put her hand on my arm. She did not speak, but pointed to the  caves through which we had come, and through which we were to return.</p>
<p>We both stood transfixed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What o&rsquo;clock is it?&rsquo;  were her first words.</p>
<p>&lsquo;4.30,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is it possible? Have we  been here two hours nearly? We had better see if it is yet possible to return  by the caves, and if not, we must try and get up the higher rocks outside. I  will try the depth with my parasol.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take mine,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;it  is larger.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She stepped along the  great stones back to the entrance of the caves, and I followed her in a kind of  dream. A great part of the boulders inside had disappeared. Perhaps a boy might  yet have scrambled through, holding on to the sides and jumping from one to the  other; but at the farther end, the tiny brook we had crossed so easily was a  deep wide flood &mdash; a river.</p>
<p>We are not the first who  have been overtaken by the tide, and I am afraid we shall not be the last; but  to my dying day I shall never forget the strange, cold, sick feeling that came  over me, when I saw that wide gulf between us and safety. How changed the whole  scene was! That which had appeared so beautiful seemed now a great monster  eager for its prey; the quiet &lsquo;water lapping on the crags,&rsquo; an enemy thirsting  for us, ever drawing nearer and nearer.</p>
<p>Gerty turned her pale  face to me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunty dear,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we  cannot return by the caves; we must make our way back quickly, and get on  higher ground at once. We can scramble up some of the rocks; take care where  you tread, for the sea-weed is slippery; let me go first.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She passed me and went  on, step by step, pausing to hold her hand or parasol as a help to me. We  climbed up some large rocks &mdash; fear alone enabled me to do it &mdash; and when out of  reach of water, then, at least, we paused to take breath and look around us.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunt Gertrude, we must  go higher yet. I think if we can reach that large round rock, it looks dry; at  any rate, it is dry <em>now</em>, and if we  can go no farther, we must trust to a boat passing near, that will take us off  soon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She was so calm, she kept  me calm; and on we went again, she first, as before, helping me up, from ledge  to ledge and crag to crag, till we reached the rock she had singled out. I was  so tired and nervous then, I trembled all over. She took off her jacket, spread  it for me, and made me sit down on what she called the most comfortable corner.  She had a small bottle of eau-de-cologne in her pocket, and she bathed my  forehead and gave it me to smell. Dear child, I shall never smell  eau-de-cologne again without feeling as if I were on that rock. After first  examining our <em>locale</em>, she seated  herself on a ledge a little below me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do not feel sure we  are above high-water mark,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but we can get no higher, and we must  stand up if the tide <em>does</em> reach us.  Some fishing-boats or pleasure-boats must pass soon. I wish I had brought my  bernouse to make into a flag.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was fortunate for us  she had not.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; I said, and I know  my voice was very shaky, &lsquo;you feel quite sure we shall not be drowned?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot feel sure, dear  aunty; we must trust and hope,&rsquo; she said, looking up with almost a smile at me,  and then at the blue sky above us.</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;<em>He</em> bids the mighty ocean deep<br>
Its own appointed limits keep,&rsquo;</p>
<p>she added, clasping her  hands upon her knees.</p>
<p>I felt she was praying.  Somehow I could not pray; but a sort of review of my life passed before me &mdash; my  self-indulgent life; my money spent chiefly on myself; my once to church on  Sundays, when fine; my visiting or visitors on Sunday afternoons; my sociable  little dinners on Sunday evenings; the perfect indifference for anything like  holiness. I scarcely knew what holiness meant. And all my wealth! What good was  it now to me? and how much I might have done with it! Everything seemed to  glide before me. I could not retain one fixed thought, or event, or deed;  another seemed to rise up behind it and take its place; and that was in its  turn swept away by another; and all the time my eyes were fixed on a star-fish  in a little pool of water left by the last tide; but how long would it be there?  It would be washed away out into the deep by the next. It was below me. I could  not tell how far, it seemed about a yard below me, perhaps more; the salt water  had not reached it yet, but was rushing in, nearer and nearer. I sat watching  it stretch out all its points, then coming in contact with a red anemone,  instantly retreat. I saw it without attending to it. All the time my thoughts  were filled with my life; then some words came into my mind, and I seemed, as  it were, two different persons; at least there was an answer to what I said.  The words kept repeating themselves over and over again, &lsquo;Thou hast much goods  laid up for many a year.&rsquo; And the answer always came, &lsquo;This night thy soul  shall be required.&rsquo; Over and over again they rang in my ears, and at last it  seemed more than I could bear.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no, not this night,  not this night!&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>I covered my face with my  hand, and with my whole heart I said again,</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, spare me! &mdash; not <em>this</em> night, my God; not this night, I  bcseech Thee!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Dear Gertrude raised  herself on her narrow ledge beside me, and putting her arm round my neck,  kissed me several times, and then she said she would make a signal if I would  give her my handkerchief to add to hers. She fastened them to her parasol, and  every now and then waved them in the air.</p>
<p>That dreadful little lark  was singing again, louder and louder, higher and higher; it sounded so  different now.</p>
<p>Gerty looked at my watch-twenty  minutes past five! It seemed hours that we had been sitting there. I looked  down; the little pool below me had spread wider, deeper, and the star-fish had  disappeared.</p>
<p>Suddenly I thought a voice  called out &lsquo;Gertrude!&rsquo; She started up. &lsquo;Here, Alan, here!&rsquo; and then burst into  tears. There was a pause. She waved the handkerchief as high as she could  again. I heard voices. They were above us. &lsquo;Lady Chester! Gertrude!&rsquo; they were  calling.</p>
<p>I tried to answer, but  only a sob came. Gertrude recovered herself; she was quite calm and collected  again. She answered in a high clear tone,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Alan, Alan!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A few moments more, and a  head appeared over the cliff some twenty feet above us.</p>
<p>It was Alan Wingfield.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Take care, take care!&rsquo;  she screamed; &lsquo;you must go round and bring a boat for us; we are quite safe  yet; you cannot come this way, Alan.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There was another voice,  and then Alan said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;We are going for a boat;  we shall be with you very soon; stay where you are, Gertrude dear; don&rsquo;t try to  move till I come.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She kissed her hand to  him, and the head disappeared; she sat down again, and we both had a good cry  together; and then she tried to laugh, and said she must undo the flag, for our  handkerchiefs were wanted to wipe away our tears. Then she kissed me again and  we waited hand in hand, the tide every now and then washing up to the rock on  which we were.</p>
<p>O, the joy of seeing the  boat come round the corner of the reef! There was Alan Wingfield, and a keeper,  and a boatman. It belonged to Mr. Bassett, of Watermouth Castle. Alan and the  keeper jumped out on to the rocks, the spray dashing over them as they landed.  In a few minutes, splashing through the water, they stood on the crag below us.  It was a large flat one covered with sea-weed, and they stood tolerably firm on  it, though nearly up to their knees in water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Thank God, my darling!&rsquo;  Alan said, holding up his arms to take her.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aunt Gertrude first,  please, Alan. &rsquo;</p>
<p>But I could not allow  that.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;I  shall feel safer with that good keeper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It made no difference to  him, which of us he saved, for I am not very heavy, and a great difference to  Alan; so he lifted her down, and splashing again through the waves, and slowly  feeling his way for sure footing on the rocks, he reached the boat; and a few  minutes after I was beside her, safe, but O, so wet! O, the happiness of  feeling safe once more! and O, the happiness of standing on dry land again!</p>
<p>My knees shook so, I  could hardly walk the half mile to the carriage. On our way we heard how we had  been rescued. Alan Wingfield left Ilfracombe for a long walk round by the old  church of Berrynarbor; he passed our empty carriage, when suddenly he saw the  blue-and-white bernouse. Turning round, he asked the driver for whom he was  waiting. He replied, he had brought two ladies from the town; they had gone to  the caves, and bid him stop. At that moment, the keeper came up, and when he  heard ladies had gone to the caves, he said, ladies did not generally go without  him, but he had been to the funeral of his wife&rsquo;s mother, and only just  returned. Looking at his watch, he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;No ladies can be in the  caves now; tide&rsquo;s been flowing two hours and more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Much alarmed, Alan and he  hurried through the field to the little wood. Alan insisted on descending the  little steep path to the caves; and his horror may easily be imagined on seeing  them half filled with water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told you, sir,&rsquo; said  the keeper, &lsquo;they could not be down here now, and alive. Tide rises six feet an  hour in them caves. They may have gotten on to the rocks outside; and our best  way is up again and over the hill that is above us, and look down on the cliffs  for them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So up again they hurried,  and out of the wood, and through the ferns and brushwood; scrambling down the  almost precipitous cliff, and then on hands and knees approaching the edge,  Alan succeeded in letting us know help was at hand. He had called several times  before we heard, and almost in despair, was sending off the keeper for a rope,  when Gertrude&rsquo;s &lsquo;Here, Alan, here!&rsquo; sounded from below.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, the gentleman was  thankful, indeed he was, miss,&rsquo; said the good keeper, with a smile at Gerty, as  he helped me into the carriage; &lsquo;and I hope there&rsquo;s many years&rsquo; happiness in  store for both of you.&rsquo; I told him to call next day, and a five-pound note very  much delighted him. I could not sleep that night. I lay awake, going over that  long hour of agony again and again, thankful that this night my soul had not  been required of me. Over and over again I thanked God for sparing us. Then I  tried to arrange some plans for the future; and this is what I have determined  on:</p>
<p>I shall let my house in  London, and take a very pretty old-fashioned manor-house in Alan Wingfield&rsquo;s  parish. Priggins shall leave me. I have settled three hundred a year on my dear  niece Gertrude. They are to be married on the 18th October; and I am very glad  she refused Sir William. </p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="AtHomeInNorway"></a>At Home In Norway</strong></h2>
<p>WHEN I was a little girl,  I was given one birthday that delicious story of Norwegian life, <em>Feats on the Fiord</em>. Hitherto a brown  musty-smelling copy of the <em>Vicar of  Wakefield</em> &mdash; its type disfigured by long s&rsquo;s &mdash; a volume of Scott&rsquo;s poems, and  some of Andersen&rsquo;s fairy tales had been the chief delights of a lonely  childhood spent in a quiet country house. <em>Feats  on the Fiord</em> opened to me a new chapter of romance: I can vividly recall  the eager delight with which I pored over it, till every glowing tint of the  free bright world to which it transported me became far more real than my  colourless every-day life of commonplace and routine. In my childish heart  there woke wild visions of a future, in which I, &nbsp;grown up, should in some fashion, the details  of which I never troubled myself to think out, attain the acme of felicity,  turn my face northward, and live a glorious life of my own among the blue  fiords and snowy fjelds of &lsquo;Gamle Norge.&rsquo; Change came to that quiet home, and  amid new scenes and fuller life the old dreams were almost forgotten. Not  entirely, though, only rationalised, &mdash; I no longer wished to exchange England  for Norway <em>en permanence</em>; but  whenever I came across the little well-worn book which had opened to me the  fairyland of my childhood, I used to send a little hopeless wish, after the  realisation of my old projects. &lsquo;All things are for him who knows how to wait,&rsquo;  says the Wise Man. My opportunity came most unexpectedly; I seized it; and with  a friend who like myself was possessed with a spirit of adventure, and content  to give up home comforts for a time, determined to put on a brave though  feminine courage, and meet with light hearts both the ups and the downs that  might await us, we set off in the glooms of November for a year in Bergen.</p>
<p>We have summered it and  wintered it among the descendants of the old Vikings since then, and I daresay  that some bits from a kind of gossiping journal kept for home eyes, and  treating of every-day home life, may find favour with less partial readers, as  the great majority of books on Scandinavia are written by passing travellers,  and can therefore touch only on the outside of things.</p>
<p><em>Bergen, November</em> 25<em>th</em>, 186-. &mdash; It is just a  week to-day since Janet and I for the first time toiled up the slippery ill-paved  hills which pass for streets in this part of the world, and already we have  settled down into our new home and life, and begin to realise that &lsquo;here we are!&rsquo;  and, with just a little wonder at our own temerity, that here we must remain,  come what may, at least till spring. Now  uncle F &mdash; is not to shrug his shoulders with that &lsquo;I told you so&rsquo; air; he must  take back the shrug, for the speedy repentance his prophetic eye foresaw  following on our &lsquo;wild undertaking&rsquo; has yet to come; here we are, and would not  for the world be anywhere else. But of course after the first plunge from the  green banks of fancy into the cold waters of fact one may be allowed an  involuntary shudder, and wild grasp after any twig of connection with one&rsquo;s old  standing-ground. Our telegram told you of our arrival without giving details,  and our first letter was not much better. Here are a few.</p>
<p>Well, imagine us on last  Friday evening standing on the wet slippery deck of the steamer (not alone and  unfriended, for Fr&oacute;ken Annessen had come on board to welcome us), trying with  curious eyes to penetrate the utterly impenetrable cloud of mist and darkness  that enwrapped us.</p>
<p>You remember how we had  pictured our first sight of Bergen: a dazzling winter scene &mdash; mountains, pines,  housetops, streets, snow-covered &mdash; icicles sparkling everywhere &mdash; fur-clad  figures flitting about &mdash; the air musical with sleigh-bells &mdash; for my own part, I  expected to find a stand of reindeer sledges on the landing-quay. That was  fancy; here is fact.</p>
<p>A very homelike fog  composed of equal parts of mist and rain, an uncomfortable gusty wind more  chill and cheerless than keen, and for anything we could see of mountains, we  might have been anchored in the Humber. We did not wait, however, to bemoan  dispelled illusions. The Fr&oacute;ken smoothed away all our difficulties; we soon  found ourselves climbing down the ship&rsquo;s side (a horrid business) into a tiny  rocking boat; then came a swift passage over the dark water, a landing on a  little wooden quay, and we were in Norway. You can guess how giddy and weary we  felt after our four days&rsquo; voyage from Copenhagen, as we toiled up and down a  succession of slippery hilly streets lighted by the dimmest of lamps. The Fr&oacute;ken  introduced us to our landlady and rooms, and invited us most warmly to go to  supper at her house; but we longed for rest and quiet, and our first movement  was, when left alone, to inspect our beds. Such comical little boxes they are!  children&rsquo;s cribs half grown up, furnished with a feather-bed, downiest of the  downy &mdash; a regular lazy hollow &mdash; a pile of enormous square pillows, and a  solitary eider-down coverlet. If one could curl into a ball, dormouse fashion,  and sleep without twist or turn till morning, it would be cosy enough; but I  not being gifted with more than average power of becoming monumental, and the  counterpane being a mere untuckable-in bag of feathers, it spends the night  in a series of escapes, and I in a series of captures. I now place a row of  chairs every night at each side of the bed to catch it &mdash; this saves me the  trouble of groping over the floor in the dark; but it persistently prefers  taking up its position on either row to staying where it ought to be. That  first night we did feel lonely. A horrid eerie sense of far-awayness from you  all &mdash; &lsquo;being pendent from our own hook,&rsquo; as Janet slangily put it &mdash; made us  leave our door of communication open, and hold rather a sentimental dialogue,  ended by a &lsquo;good-night&rsquo; sent over the water. I hope its warmth was not washed  out by the time it reached you.</p>
<p>We have had quite a busy  week of unpacking and settling in. Our rooms now look really pretty and  home-like &mdash; foreign, and not exactly <em>comfortable</em>,  for we miss thick English carpets and curtains. Our sitting-room &mdash; <em>dagligstue</em> it is called here &mdash; is a  large oblong room, with two French windows reaching almost from floor to  ceiling; the floor is painted a light golden brown, and shines like satin wood;  there is a little island of carpet in the centre, scarcely larger than an  English hearth-rug; the walls and ceiling too are painted &mdash; the former a pale  pearly blue, with a narrow cornice of ultramarine and gold; the latter glossy  white, like satin: the paint here is most peculiar &mdash; such a sheen, without the  hard surface of varnish. Between the windows there is a long narrow mirror in a  heavily-carved frame of dark wood. They are hung with white muslin; and at each  side stands a great pot of blue-and-gold china, containing an ivy-plant, which,  trained up the walls and along the curtain-rods, falls in lovely graceful  wreaths over the clear muslin: is not that pretty? Sofa and chairs are heavy  old-fashioned things covered with black damask. We have two rocking-chairs, a  large centre and two smaller tables, a tiny chiffonnier, and a remarkably tall  piano, which Janet has succeeded in hiring to her great joy; then our crimson  bookshelves hang on each side of the great stove opposite the windows: this  morning we unpacked our books. That is a long description, but I know you want  to see us in our new home as we see you in the old. I wish I could show you  Ingebor, our <em>pige</em>, meaning maid. Such  a bonnie golden-haired lassie, dressed in the peasant costume, a dark petticoat  with bright scarlet bodice; her long hair drawn back by a scarlet fillet, and  falling below her waist in two long thick plaits; her honest simple rosy face  aglow with smiles at every attempt we make to open communications, and her  great blue eyes widely distended, and wonderingly fixed on the two <em>Engelske damer</em>. No matter how her hands  are busied, those eyes never swerve from their gaze at us: she leaves the room <em>backward</em>, that she may not lose for one  moment look or gesture, and keeps knocking up against things with the most  utter unconcern as to the consequences either to her solid self or our more  fragile belongings.</p>
<p>All that first morning,  while busy with our unpacking, we peered now and then through the mist outside  for the mountains; but all in vain; all that we could discover from the windows  of our new world was that they &lsquo;gave&rsquo; on a great oblong Platz, about which  streaming umbrellas were leisurely moving, or contentedly grouping themselves,  while the owners enjoyed a friendly gossip. The annual rain-fall here being  greater than that of any other city in Europe, the Bergenese seem to have grown  accustomed to a kind of amphibious life: of course in a place where two out of  every three days are wet, people must learn to be more or less regardless of  weather, unless they wish to be confined to the house for the greater part of  the year; but I fear we shall never attain to the true Bergen delight in  pouring rain. We have from our <em>dagligstue</em> a view across a small public park; and it affords us the most intense amusement  to watch ladies and gentlemen enveloped in waterproofs, and insufficiently  sheltered under dripping umbrellas, not only sauntering up and down the spongy  paths, but sitting composedly on the wet wooden benches to be rained on.</p>
<p>Feeling we could not too  soon begin to accustom ourselves to aquatic habits, we put on waterproofs and  goloshes, and unfurling our umbrellas, set forth on a tour of inspection; but  we soon found that instead of <em>inspecting</em>,  we were being <em>inspected</em>. Nothing  could have been less remarkable, more like what was worn by every lady we met,  than our dark waterproofs and black hats, so that it must have been some  mysterious personal attribute that attracted every eye as we emerged into the  street; nothing to feed our vanity, however &mdash; if we had been two black-beetles  belonging to some hitherto undiscovered genus, the air of calm curious study  could not have been more unmistakable. We made our progress, every gentleman we  met uncovering in our honour, every lady taking us in in a long silent gaze;  peasants and servant-maids returning from the fish-market, with enormous cods  hanging by the gills from their fingers, the tails trailing along the ground,  stopped to criticise; while all of young Bergen not just then at school formed  a volunteer escort up and down the muddy streets. It was my first experience of  a bodyguard, and I felt more indignant than honoured. Janet bore it with  admirable philosophy. I see our Fr&oacute;ken crossing the Platz in our direction; we  are going to plunge into society under her chaperonage, to make a round of  morning calls. Strangers here make the first call &mdash; odd, isn&rsquo;t it? I shall tell  you all about it to-morrow.</p>
<p><em>November</em> 28<em>th</em>. &mdash; Almost a week since I wrote the  last lines; but as we have sent off two packets of letters in the interval, I  have not had much leisure for journalising. It is so nice to talk to you all,  even on paper, and you should see how we watch the postman! <em>Postbuden</em> he is up here, and does not  come with the brisk rat-tat of our English wont; he heralds his approach here  by a horn solo given at every street-corner as the post, consisting of two  mud-bespattered caravans, makes its appearance. The letters are first taken to  the office to be sorted. We have two hours at least of horrid suspense before <em>postbuden</em> comes to us, during which time  we sit clinking any number of skillings, for we have to purchase each letter  with a small copper coin. We have learned to know his tramp on the uncarpeted  staircase, and mind you let us hear it often, poor wretched exiles that we are!</p>
<p>I have to tell you of our  visits to Bergen&rsquo;s <em>&eacute;lite</em>. From eleven  to one o&rsquo;clock is the time here for ceremonious calls. At about half-past ten  we set out in the midst of a thick fall of half-melted snow, which had lasted  all night and covered the streets with a cold penetrating slush, into which we  sank almost ankle deep at every step. We felt some distressful qualms at the  idea of introducing our damp and dripping persons into the houses of strangers;  but as our little Fr&oacute;ken seemed to think it all right, we made our very first  appearance in Scandinavian society as &mdash; to quote Mr. Mantalini &mdash; &lsquo;moist  unpleasant bodies.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our first impressions are  pleasant &mdash; very. Such cordial welcomes we got! Wine was everywhere brought in  to drink our &lsquo;Velkommen til Norge og lykkelig ophold&rsquo; (Welcome to Norway, and a  happy stay). We saw only one gentleman, but liked the ladies much: most of them  speak English. The houses are exquisitely neat, and have a certain simple  elegance about them, though they lack the <em>cosiness</em> of home, sweet home. The halls and staircases are ugly, neither mats nor carpets;  there is none of the pretty litter scattered about the sitting-rooms, which  gives the graceful home air to our English rooms &mdash; no books or periodicals on  the tables, the music always put tidily away, and the piano closed. Everybody  was busy, and the click of the knitting-kneedles kept up a staccato  accompaniment to our talk. I am sure we shall not long feel strangers here,  every one is so brightly kindly courteous. Fru and fr&oacute;ken answer to the German  frau and fr&auml;ulein, and are used much in the same fashion. There is one little  old maiden lady to whom I have taken an immense fancy &mdash; a quaint quick little  woman, with rippling steel-gray hair and sparkling black eyes framed by the  primmest of crimped close caps. She has taught herself English; and though she  had never spoken with an English person before, she dashed into fluent  conversation with us at once, her brows knit, her pauses of the briefest; for,  as she honestly told us, &lsquo;the answers can I not understand.&rsquo; &lsquo;How does fr&oacute;ken&rsquo;  (meaning me) &lsquo;find herself in Norway? I hope fr&oacute;kerne&rsquo; (meaning both of us)  &lsquo;find themselves good in their new logis. The weather has been bad in the last  time; but soon hope I it becomes better. Longs fr&oacute;ken after her family? Lives  still the herr pappa and the frue mamma? Fr&oacute;ken must write often and receive  many letters, and try to find herself in a strange land. Here are many who are  glad in the English, and will prize highly if fr&oacute;ken will see them in their  houses and make at home.&rsquo; And so on, with the utmost delight and independence  of replies. Don&rsquo;t you think there is something really nice and hospitable in  this bringing forth of their best, without waiting to consider if it is  positively <em>good</em> before producing it,  as we stiff English are prone to do with foreign languages? One old  gentleman,whose heart was touched by Janet&rsquo;s admiration of a beautiful  silver-gray, blue-eyed Norwegian cat, a great pet of his, had her words  translated to him, and now exclaims with unction when they meet, as if quite  charmed to have a subject in common, &lsquo;Glo-ri-ous cot! Fr&oacute;ken! glo-ri-ous cot!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We are going to the theatre  this evening. There is a Danish company here. Good-bye. Janet has opened the  door of the stove to let the light flicker out for our twilight talk;  unfortunately the smoke comes with it. It is only three o&rsquo;clock now, and I can  hardly see to write. We are going out to walk at five, in mud and darkness.  They say they have seen both moon and sun up here. I rather think they delude  themselves in thinking so; neither has &lsquo;put in an appearance&rsquo; since our  arrival.</p>

<p>The clubs are empty;  Rotten Row<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is void of life as Martin Tupper<br>
  There&rsquo;s not a mortal wight I know<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ask to dinner or to supper;<br>
  One&rsquo;s friends, one&rsquo;s cronies, dogs and men,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are in the country shooting, fishing &mdash; <br>
  I wonder if Commandment Ten <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is thoroughly applied to wishing.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll haunt my favourite  club no more,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m wasting daily, growing thinner; <br>
  To-night, behind a furtive door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I eat a modest lonely dinner.<br>
  The waiter glared in scornful rage <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At me, then soften&rsquo;d into pity;<br>
  I heard him tell the button&rsquo;d page<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I was some one from the City!</p>
<p>Over the walnuts and the  wine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quite forgot the dismal present, <br>
  Until this stolid brain of mine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fill&rsquo;d with something much more pleasant &mdash; <br>
  Flew backward to my salad days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was young and very gushing, <br>
  When I was blest with artless ways,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ere I&rsquo;d lost the knack of blushing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A happy thought! By  Jove, why not?&rsquo; &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My very whiskers grew excited &mdash; <br>
  &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and see this pleasant spot <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all my youthful days were blighted;<br>
  A hero, though of middle age,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll vie with knights of ancient story, &mdash; <br>
  I too will make a pilgrimage;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too will revel in its glory.&rsquo;</p>
<p>With half a sigh, and  half a laugh,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half a bottle from the cellar &mdash; <br>
  &lsquo;Here, waiter, bring my pilgrim&rsquo;s staff &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean my paragon umbrella;<br>
  And fill my case with mild cigars,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, waiter, choose me, if you can, some<br>
  Whose ruddy glow will shame the stars; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then cut away, and call a hansom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So off we drove towards  the north:<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cabman, drunk and very civil, <br>
  Seem&rsquo;d half inclined to shoot me forth, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And half to drive me to the devil;<br>
  Till wild with fear and mad with rage,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Stop at the Angel, fool!&rsquo; I shouted <br>
  (One should not cab a pilgrimage &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There cannot be a doubt about it).</p>
<p>And then towards the  Lower-road, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through pious Islington I wended.<br>
  There to the left was her abode,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dwelling not exactly splendid;<br>
  And yet, I think, a Becket&rsquo;s shrine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could scarcely call up holier fancies<br>
  Than well&rsquo;d within this heart of mine <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of boyish days aud young romances.</p>
<p>Loo was a little damsel  then,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With yearning big blue eyes &mdash; ay, bluer<br>
  Than any of the &lsquo;upper ten&rsquo; &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps they told their secrets truer;<br>
  A curly mass of yellow hair<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Down falling in luxuriant tresses;<br>
  A voice so sweet, I did not care <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all her aitches&rsquo; rash excesses;</p>
<p>A waist seem&rsquo;d cast in  Psyche&rsquo;s mould,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What wonder that Dan Cupid found it? &mdash; <br>
  And if her cloak were worn and old,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more need for an arm around it;<br>
  A little hand, toil-hard, yet quite <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As shapely as a haughty duchess&rsquo;;<br>
  More honest, perhaps, if not so white, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And full of petting, timorous touches.</p>
<p>A straggler after fame  was I,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dismal kind of poetaster;<br>
  But Pegasus, the brute, was shy,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And often threw his would-be master.<br>
  Loo lived by making pretty flowers <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well as niggard ladies let her;<br>
  Yet of these rival trades of ours,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m very sure hers paid the better.</p>
<p>A little farther down the  right,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my old house, how grimly quiet!<br>
  Erst ringing all a livelong night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With madcap freak and jovial riot!<br>
  O scene of happy student-days,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When life was bright and very sunny,<br>
  I think I lived on beer and praise &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I did not live on money.</p>
<p>What hours of toil, what  midnight oil,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that old gloomy room were wasted!<br>
  And when my Muse was in the &lsquo;blues.&rsquo; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What sweetly-bitter draughts we tasted!<br>
  O jocund times, not soon forgot &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So litle pleasure seem&rsquo;d to leaven<br>
  My whole existence, and my lot<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had been a sort of seventh heaven, </p>
<p>But that my landlady &mdash; ah,  well,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the race were sent to try us &mdash; <br>
  Possess&rsquo;d peculiar views on hell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was fond of gin, and very pious.<br>
  And O, the too proverbial cat<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was always breeding strife between us &mdash; <br>
  It eat my papers, lost my hat,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, doubtless shock&rsquo;d, destroy&rsquo;d my Venus.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas here, when I was  sick abed,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Loo, wondering what could be the matter,<br>
  Came to inquire, turn&rsquo;d tail and fled,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Mrs. Jones was up and at her;<br>
  So from that window quite by stealth <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (The creature was so very proper)<br>
  I threw a nightly bill of health<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well weighted with a heavy copper.</p>
<p>But I grew better by  degrees,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bolder, till I ventured slyly <br>
  To toss her out my bunch of keys,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Loo would come up trembling shyly.<br>
  One night &mdash; our last night &mdash; we rehearsed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A costumed reading from the drama; <br>
  &rsquo;Twas Shakespeare, with the parts reversed &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her Romeo was a perfect charmer.</p>
<p>Her dress would bring the  Surrey down &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;d corked her eyebrows and her lashes; <br>
  A smoking-cap, a dressing-gown,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A pair of tightly-glued moustaches. <br>
  And she was kneeling by my side,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was loving as a Romeo could be, <br>
  Whilst I was wrapp&rsquo;d in maiden pride, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet tender too, as Juliet should be.</p>
<p>We gave ourselves a loud  encore,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When something stirr&rsquo;d, or something sounded,<br>
  And there, beside the open door,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My guardian stood, amazed, dumbfounded.<br>
  He seized my darling by the waist,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He almost seem&rsquo;d inclin&rsquo;d to shake her<br>
  (He&rsquo;d come from Spain in anxious haste, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was grandson to a Quaker).</p>
<p>It was a more exciting  scene<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than ever Frith or Millais painted:<br>
  I turn&rsquo;d at once a pallid green,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;And Lucy did the same, and fainted;<br>
  I know my guardian look&rsquo;d an oath,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m almost certain that he swore it: <br>
  The scene was painful to us both,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so I&rsquo;ll drop the curtain o&rsquo;er it.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twas stormy, so I  hurried fast<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Toward our loved walk by the river;<br>
  I used to vow my love would last <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as it &mdash; I meant for ever.<br>
  My vow was true: the brutes, alas, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have damm&rsquo;d its sweet pellucid water, <br>
  And clothed its banks of summer grass <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sticks and stones, and bricks and mortar.</p>
<p>I look&rsquo;d around and tried  to smile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here my misery most complete was &mdash; <br>
  They&rsquo;d built a chapel on our stile,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tavern where our rustic seat was! <br>
  &rsquo;Tis half revenge and half relief<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To think these grassy banks and lea-land<br>
  Will one day echo with the grief<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of some Cook&rsquo;s tourist from New Zealand.</p>
<p>Love versus honour,  versus gold,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We both were half inclined to try it, <br>
  But thought our love might e&rsquo;en grow cold<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With flowers and sonnets for a diet; <br>
  So here we said a long &lsquo; good-bye,&rsquo;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words were very slowly spoken; <br>
  Her eyes were somewhat moist, and I <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was wretched, bilious, and heartbroken.</p>
<p>She&rsquo;s married now, and  growing fat <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A butcher or a baker is it?);<br>
  She wrote last month to tell me that <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;d bought my last new book and visite;<br>
  And that they often hoped I&rsquo;d call, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would find her changed, though not completely;<br>
  Should hear the children &mdash; nine in all &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Repeat my last productions sweetly.</p>
<p>No, laughing Loo! I&rsquo;ve  posted you <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my heart&rsquo;s album of illusions; <br>
  You&rsquo;re still, I ween, sweet seventeen, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst I am twenty &mdash; vile confusions! <br>
  Whilst I am gray, and stout, and old, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And rather blas&eacute;, very silly <br>
  To sit here shivering in the cold <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thousand miles from Piccadilly!</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="PallMallToPortSaid"></a>Pall-Mall To Port Said</strong></h2>
<p>From London to  Southampton, or indeed to Marseilles, by which latter port the great majority  of travellers to the East proceed, the route is an old and familiar one. The  record of our journey may therefore, so far as our reader is concerned, be  contained in a single line &mdash; we departed and we arrived. We bade &lsquo;good-bye&rsquo; to  Europe at Marseilles on the 6th of November, and we greeted the East at  Alexandria on the 14th of the same month. We made the coast at an early hour in  the morning, during one of the dense fogs which so often prevail in this  locality. Steaming cautiously on our course, with the lead-line out on the  port-bow, and the pilot keeping a sharp look-out from the bridge, we had  well-nigh gained the bar at the entrance to the harbour, when the fog  fortunately lifted, and Alexandria lay before us, basking in the first warm  rays of the morning sun.</p>
<p>Allow me to remark in the  outset, even at the risk of shocking my reader&rsquo;s susceptibility to sentiment,  that Alexandria is just one of those places which the traveller is always very  anxious to get to, and from which he is just as anxious to escape. He has been  looking forward &mdash; it may be for a long time &mdash; to that moment when all the  fabled wonders of this marvellous land shall break on his astonished sight at  once &mdash; when the Nile, the Pyramids, the Sphinx, Thebes, Memphis, Pompey&rsquo;s  Pillar, and Cleopatra&rsquo;s Needle, groups of bright-eyed houris, groves of  palm-trees, and droves of dromedaries, shall rise and pass in quick but solemn  procession before him; and now that the moment has arrived, the first delicious  shock of novelty over, he owns, with a sigh, that he is disappointed. Such, I  confess, were my feelings. I had been preparing myself overnight, on board the  steamer &mdash; getting myself up, as it were, for the occasion &mdash; with the aid of a  pipeful of genuine Turkish bought in Marseilles &mdash; and a moonlight contemplation  of the lovely bright blue sky overhead. I was ready and even anxious to yield  myself up, with all the solemnity due to the occasion, to the mystic grandeur  of the scene; to gaze upon the vast expanse of sand, the catacombs and mummies,  the obelisks and palms, with pyramidal wonder mingled, if necessary, with  hieroglyphic awe. But, to use the elegant and expressive language of the P.R.,  &lsquo;it was no go!&rsquo; I saw nothing but dust, dirt, desolation, and decay. My  enthusiasm fell from fever-heat to zero at once. I seemed to hear the words, &lsquo;What  came ye out for to see?&rsquo; Instead of the city of the Pharaohs I had suddenly  found myself transported to Madame Tussaud&rsquo;s famous Chamber of Horrors.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey  to the mind of the reader any very distinct impression of Alexandria by mere  description. Take a portion &mdash; the worst portion &mdash; of the East-end of London,  half a dozen of the narrowest and most ill-smelling streets of K&ouml;ln, compass  them on one side with a section of the Dismal Swamp, and on the other with a  part of Portsmouth harbour; scatter through the mass a few gaudily-painted  minarets and mosques; plant here a row or two of booths and small shops, and  there a clump of date-palms, a stack of broken tumble-down chimneys, or a  ruined burial-ground &mdash; the rendezvous of goats, donkeys, lazy priests, and  leprous beggars by day, and of packs of prowling, hungry, mangy curs by night;  over the whole scene pour the rays of a scorching-hot sun, varied at every  faint puff of wind with a cloud of choking, blinding dust &mdash; and you will have a  sufficiently vivid impression of the outward aspect of this most disgusting of  cities.</p>
<p>This may serve as an  external picture of Alexandria, but the less that is said of the interior the  better. It is filthy and repulsive beyond description, and reminds one more of  the lowest class of Chinese towns than anything else I can at present recall.  Despite its aspect of dirt and decay, Alexandria can boast three hotels of  average accommodation; all of which are, however, in the hands of Europeans,  and, of course, conducted on the &lsquo;European plan.&rsquo; These are the Hotel Abbat,  the Hotel de l&rsquo;Europe, and the Peninsular and Oriental Hotel. I selected the  first for my temporary resting-place; and having a somewhat lively presentiment  of the nature of the ordeal through which it was necessary to pass in order to  reach it, I determined to set out as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In company with one of my  fellow-passengers, a young civil engineer on his way out for the first time to  India, where he was to be employed on the Great Peninsular Railway, I descended  from the steamer&rsquo;s deck to one of the small boats, and seated in its stern-sheets  was soon rowed ashore by a couple of lusty half-naked Arabs. The boats are  almost all built on the English model, substantial, but without any pretension  to style or speed, and are usually manned by two rowers, who ply the oar  standing.</p>
<p>The prevailing aspect of  Alexandria is European. Notwithstanding the bronzed skins and flowing fancy-coloured  costumes of the natives, the visitor from the West instinctively realises that  he is in a community, the prevailing elements of which have been gathered from  sources akin to his own. There are slop-sellers, marine-store and junk dealers,  swarthy-visaged sailors in short pea-jackets and superabundant shirt-collars,  and in close proximity the porter-houses, surmounted by such familiar signs as  the Golden Horn, the Union Jack, the Prince of Wales, &amp;c. &amp;c. Hacks,  cabs, and carriages ply for hire in the narrow, tortuous streets, and one  momentarily expects to see a lumbering London omnibus turn the corner of the  street, and hear the well-known cockney cry of &lsquo;Bank!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hy!&rsquo; &lsquo;Lon-don-bridge!&rsquo;  &lsquo;Elephant and Castle!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yip! yip!&rsquo; Occasionally one of these vehicles, minus  the signboards and placards which form so conspicuous a feature of their London  prototypes, and surmounted instead by an enormous board, with the name of the  hotel to which it plies affixed in large gilt letters, dashes past on its way  from the landing; but by far the most numerous and noteworthy appliances of  locomotion in Alexandria, or, indeed, anywhere throughout Egypt, are the  donkeys. If good Betsey Trotwood had lived in Egypt, instead of the shady  suburbs of Dover, she would have howled herself hoarse calling, &lsquo;Donkeys!  Janet, donkeys!&rsquo;</p>
<p>We have now traversed the  Greek and native quarters, and reached a corner of the square in which the  Abbat is situated. This is one of the favourite haunts of the donkey boys; and  as we near the spot where they all stand grouped, we are besieged with a  yelling chorus of Arab voices in every variety of tone and pitch. &lsquo;Ride, sir!&rsquo;  &lsquo;Donkey, sir!&rsquo; &lsquo;Werry good donkey, sir! Speak good English &mdash; werry good.&rsquo;  Whether the boy intended to convey the impression that his donkey spoke English  as well as himself, I could never ascertain.</p>
<p>All romantic notions  about the fabled mysteries of the Orient disappear with the donkey drivers pressing  invitation to ride. You might as well be impressed with Hampstead-heath or  Blackheath as with your first introduction to the land of the Nile. These  donkeys form one of the most striking features of the country. I early formed  an attachment for these long-eared, long-sulfering, faithful little creatures,  which a subsequent acquaintance with the very numerous family only served to  increase. I surveyed the Pyramids and old Cairo from the back of a donkey;  traversed the greater part of the city in the same way; and was only induced to  forego the satisfaction of subsequently &lsquo;doing&rsquo; the famous Suez ship canal in  like manner, by receiving intelligence from an official quarter that there were  no arrangements made for the reception of donkeys &mdash; no <em>pons-asinorum</em> to carry them safely over &mdash; and that it would be  necessary to take a steam-tug or &lsquo;dahabieh&rsquo; instead. A word or two about these  donkeys before I dismiss them to their hard fate. They differ from the  quadruped known to Britishers under the same name only in that they are  smaller. As regards size, they are a medium between a Shetland pony and a goat,  and combine the stolidity and staidness of the former with the hardihood,  patience, and endurance of the latter. Many of them, despite their diminutive size,  are really handsome valuable animals, sleek-skinned, fine-limbed, and  sure-footed. They are wonderfully adapted to the habits of the people and the  necessities of the country, and though roughly and even sometimes cruelly  treated, they are universally esteemed and highly prized. The riding of one of  these little animals is far from being a dignified occupation for a European.  Nor indeed is it an easy one at first. The main difficulty I found presented  itself at the outset of my career: how was I to mount? that was the question.  Was there to be a donkey for me, and another abreast for my legs? Was I to face  the animal&rsquo;s head, and guide him by his ears, as I had seen the Arab boys do?  or was I to face around, and endeavour to maintain my equilibrium by a vigorous  application of both hands to the caudal appendage &mdash; the &lsquo;steering apparatus,&rsquo;  as Jack called it &mdash; which hung within easy reach behind? Halting between the  two alternatives, I waited until I reached a secluded spot in a neighbouring  street, where, shut out from all chance of observation, I ascended or rather  descended, for the donkey&rsquo;s legs were shorter than mine, on the poor little  animal&rsquo;s back. Instead of being demolished at once, as I had rather expected,  it trotted forward quite briskly, requiring no spur or other admonition to  haste, except an occasional &lsquo;whoop&rsquo; from the little Arab boy who followed  behind.</p>
<p>Without doubt the finest  show in all Alexandria at the present day is Pompey&rsquo;s famous Pillar. I state  this, I am aware, at no small risk of challenge from one or other of the army  of sight-seekers and relic-hunters who annually swarm over Egypt, as did the  locusts of old, and who, having a somewhat exalted opinion of their own  estimate of the popular taste, are disposed to regard any difference of opinion  which may happen to be entertained by others as little short of presumption.  The most remarkable objects in the ancient city are reported to have been the  Pharos and the library. The former, which was one of the &lsquo;Seven Wonders of the  World,&rsquo; was the well-known tower or lighthouse, upon the site of which the  present lighthouse stands. It was a square building of white marble, and is  said to have cost 800 talents, which in Attic money is equal to 155,000<em>l</em>. sterling, or double that sum if  computed by the talent of Alexandria. The library, as well as the museum to  which it was attached, was established by Ptolemy Soter, and was maintained at  the public expense. Ptolemy the Second made important additions to it. At his  death it is computed to have contained no less than 100,000 volumes; which  number was increased by his successors to 700,000, which would represent a  collection but little less than that now contained in the library of the  British Museum. But both these renowned monuments of ancient Alexandria have  long since disappeared. Of all the ancient monuments of the once proud capital,  the Pillar and the obelisks are the only ones remaining in good preservation;  and of these the Pillar, as before stated, should be, as it invariably is,  first visited. It is a magnificent shaft, exquisitely formed, and in a  remarkable state of preservation. Less impressive than the Pyramids, it is  nevertheless more striking. It stands on an eminence less than 2000 feet from  the present city walls, and towering far above all surrounding objects, is  easily seen in approaching the city, either by sea or land. We reached it after  a few minutes&rsquo; riding on the back of our favourite donkey Abraham &lsquo;Linklum,&rsquo;  which we had found contentedly chewing his cud just outside the hotel-entrance.  &lsquo;Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar!&rsquo; we cried. &lsquo;Y&rsquo;up!&rsquo; cried the little donkey driver; and in  less than a twinkling we were at the base of the mighty shaft.</p>
<p>Though universally called  Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar, it is not easy to find upon what authority its title to be so  called rests. From a literal translation of the inscription found on the  Pillar, and copied by Sir Gardner Wilkinson and Mr. Salt, it would appear to  have been erected by Publius, a prefect of Egypt, in honour of Diocletian, and  intended to record the capture of the city by that monarch during the rebellion  of Achilleus, A.D. 296. It consists of a capital, shaft, base, and pedestal,  which last reposes on substructures of smaller blocks, once no doubt belonging  to older monuments, and probably brought to Alexandria for the purpose.</p>
<p>A few years ago the  prying curiosity of Europeans, added to the cupidity of their Arab guides and  attendants, had well-nigh brought the grand old pillar down about their ears.  By digging and picking out the cement that united these stones, they had so  weakened the foundation of the pillar as to seriously endanger its safety.  Fortunately, the Pasha heard of what was going on in time to order the holes to  be stopped up, and thus averted the threatened calamity. The shaft is one solid  block of granite, 73 feet high and 30 feet in circumference. The total height  of the pillar is 98 feet 9 inches. The capital and pedestal have the appearance  of being unfinished and of inferior workmanship, which is accounted for by the  supposition that they are of a date subsequent to that of the shaft, and were  added to it at the period of its erection in honour of the emperor.</p>
<p>But <em>revenons &agrave; nos moutons</em> &mdash; or rather to our donkeys, which, while we  have in imagination been scaling the lofty pillar, have been patiently  regarding us from an adjoining sand-ridge. The man who would visit Pompey&rsquo;s  Pillar, or, indeed, any of the sights of Alexandria, should not only be endowed  with an ample stock of patience, but also should be armed with a stout stick,  with which to ward off the crowds of piteous-looking beggars and cunning  curio-mongers who beset his steps at every turn. A vigorous application of the  &lsquo;hickory&rsquo; to the backs and shoulders of all such as dared to intercept us in  the course of our Pompeyan tour, had the desired effect of keeping the course  comparatively clear while we were on foot; but no sooner had we called our  faithful <em>gamin</em> and mounted our  donkeys than we were completely surrounded by these human ants, who crawled all  around and well-nigh over us in their frantic efforts to palm off on us some of  their trashy wares, crying, &lsquo;Bakshish! bakshish! Mas&rsquo;r bakshish! Give, give!&rsquo;  in the most piteous tones imaginable. The majority were small boys, who carried  little sharp pieces of granite taken from a neighbouring pile. These they palm  off as pieces of the Pillar. This was bad enough; but the grown-up men had  adopted a still better dodge. Rocks are inconvenient things to carry about the  person, and so they had substituted &lsquo;Brummagem&rsquo; figures, cast in copper, after  Egyptian models. They manage to drive a lively trade in these articles during  the visiting season. Indeed, I was informed, on reliable authority, that  several tons of these trashy counterfeits are annually disposed of by these  shameless vagabonds at Pompey&rsquo;s Pillar alone.</p>
<p>In descending from the  eminence to the plain below, in a hollow space to the south-west of the column  is pointed out the site of an ancient circus or stadium, from which the small  fort thrown up by the French on the adjoining height received the name, which  it still bears, of the &lsquo;Circus Redoubt.&rsquo; But this is scarcely sufficient to woo  the visitor to a more extended sojourn in this locality. The Pillar &lsquo;prospected,&rsquo;  I was glad to escape from the glare of the broiling sun, the choking dust, and  more than all else from the howling Arabs; and our lively little donkey driver,  no doubt sharing in our anxiety to be gone, happening to administer at this  juncture a more than usually heavy blow to the donkey&rsquo;s posteriors, we bounded  rapidly down the slope and regained our hotel, where the application of soap  and warm water to our outer, and of coffee and rolls to our inner, man speedily  restored us to our wonted equanimity.</p>
<p>My next visit was to the  &lsquo;Needles,&rsquo; and a pitiable plight I found them in. These relics originally stood  at Heliopolis, whence they are reported to have been brought to Alexandria by  one of the Caesars; but this probably is only another of the romantic fictions  with which all the objects of interest in this ancient and tradition-mongering  country are so plentifully-surrounded. Only one of these &lsquo;Needles&rsquo; is standing  now; the other having been thrown down, was given by Mahomet Ali to the  British, who secured it as a record of their success in Egypt. Upon maturer  deliberation, however, it was decided to leave it; and it now remains  half-buried in sand and filth, a melancholy monument of blighted ambition and  fallen greatness. The French, more enterprising and more appreciative, not only  succeeded in carrying their obelisk away, but in transporting it safely to the  Champs Elysees of Paris, where, notwithstanding the recent destruction by the  Communists of the neighbouring Tuileries, it still forms one of the most  splendid monuments of that city.</p>
<p>Nothing now remaining of  ancient Alexandria affords the visitor such evidence of its former greatness as  the Catacombs. They are situated upon the sea-shore, about three miles to the  westward of the Frank quarter, and are easily reached either by land or water.  The entrance to these vast chambers is close to a spot once covered with the  habitations and gardens of a suburb of the city, which, on account of the  neighbouring tombs, was called the Necropolis.</p>
<p>Their extent is  sufficiently re-markable to excite wonder, but the principal inducement to  visit them is the elegance and symmetry of the architecture in one of the  chambers. This chamber has a Doric entablature and mouldings &mdash; in excellent  Greek taste &mdash; the like of which is not to be found, it is said, in any other  part of Egypt. There are other catacombs situated near the Rosetta road, about  one mile and a half to the eastward of the old wall, but they are in such a  state of decay and dilapidation as to be scarce worth visiting. A little more  than two miles beyond the Rosetta Gate stands an old Roman station, familiarly  known as the &lsquo;Camp.&rsquo; It is said to mark the site of Nicopolis, where Augustus  routed the partisans of Marc Antony. It derives special interest for English  visitors from the fact, that it is the spot where the gallant Abercrombie fell,  March 21, 1801.</p>
<p>The Camp presents a most  interesting study for the student of Egyptian architecture. In its construction  it somewhat resembles the Mazos Hermos and the fortified stations or Aydreumas  in the desert, the only perceptible difference being that it is stronger,  larger, and better built. It is quadrangular in form, and measures 290 paces by  260 paces within the walls; the latter are from five to six paces thick. These  walls are constructed of stone, with courses of flat bricks or tiles at  intervals similar to those found in Roman buildings, and the whole is  constructed on a scale worthy of the grandeur of the early days of the Empire.</p>
<p>While on this road, the  visitor should by all means push on to Aboukir, on the bay of the same name, so  well known in modern times as the scene of Nelson&rsquo;s great victory, recorded in  British annals as the Battle of the Nile. It stands near the site of the  ancient Canopus, a little to the west of the Canopic mouth of the Nile &mdash; between  which and that town stood the village of Heracleum, famed for its temple of  Hercules. Canopus, from the accounts given by Strabo, Seneca, and others, was a  very immoral place in the times of the Greeks and Romans &mdash; in fact, a sort of Vauxhall  or Jardin Mabille on a large scale. It had a temple dedicated to Serapis &mdash; a  deity supposed to answer by dreams the prayers of its votaries; and thither  repaired in boats the gay Alexandrian men and women, who danced and sang with  the most unrestrained license. Some ruins still mark the site of the city of  Heracleum &mdash; to the temple of which the guide-books, with unvarying unanimity,  inform you &lsquo;the slaves of Paris fled, when he was forced by contrary winds to  take refuge in the Canopic branch of the Nile.&rsquo; But lines of travel here, as  elsewhere throughout Egypt, are not laid in pleasant places. At whatever season  the trip to Rosetta or Aboukir is taken, the traveller will find the road  tedious and dreary in the extreme; and after looking about, and gratifying his  antiquarian appetite with a sight of ruined Heracleum and Canopus, he will be  glad &mdash; as I was &mdash; to beat a retreat to the caravanserai or caf&eacute;, where he may  appease his hunger and quench his thirst &mdash; which his walk or ride will  doubtless have given him &mdash; with something more substantial than ruins.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="TheTyneWatch"></a>The Tyne Watch</strong></h2>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1<br>
  In The Lifeboat</strong></h3>
<p>Not against human foes,  not against covetous kings and drilled soldiery, not against whistling bullets,  big battalions, and shrieking shells does Father Tyne keep watch and ward. The  winds and the waves are the only foes he fears. Shrouded by mists or lurking in  sea-worn caves they rally their forces, concert their attacks, and mature their  evil designs on the riches and lives of his gallant children. In the old days  they fought unopposed, and, like marauding Danes, ravaged his domain whenever  they chose. But now his treasure is too vast to be left at the risk of pillage,  and his sons are too dear to his fond old heart to be left at the mercy of  every piratical storm. His rollicking recklessness has given place to a manly  caution; he has put to good use all his former experience of sorrow and loss;  and his battered shield of defiance now displays the legend <em>Semper paratus</em>. Come when they may, his  hereditary foes will find him as good as his word. Night as well as day, and  day as well as night, summer as well as winter, spring-tide or neap-tide, east  wind or west wind, the Tyne Watch never relaxes for a moment; so that happen  what may, and happen at what hour it may, all the resources of science, art,  sea-craft, and hearty good-will are available to repel the incursions of the  foe.</p>
<p>So at least I am told;  but being of a sceptical turn, and much given to sleeping on duty myself, I am  rude enough to doubt the boastings in which riverside folks are so apt to  indulge; and accordingly I issue a commission <em>de inquirendo</em> addressed to myself, and forthwith proceed to head-quarters,  that I may be able to report from the very best authority on the state of the  Tyne defences against possible conspiracies and sudden raids of winds and waves.</p>
<p>It is an average winter  day. True the drum is aloft, but then it mostly is; and it tells me only that  strong winds may be expected from all quarters &mdash; which seems to me in one sense  absurd and in another self-evident. True, also, there is a fresh crisp breeze  from the east, kissing the tide out of countenance and provoking a hiss from  the topgallants of twice five hundred ships in the tiers; but as for a gale,  I&rsquo;m not such a lubber as to dream of calling this little puff a gale. I will go  to Captain Smith, take him unawares at his dinner, his grog, or his afternoon  snooze, and make him confess that half a dozen ships might go to smithereens on  the Herd sand or the Black Middens without his being one bit the wiser. Away,  then, by the narrow and pestilent open sewer which passes well enough for a  street with people whose highway is on the water. The sea-breeze sweetens and  sweeps it from end to end to-day, and sharp ozone is making the face of the  poor to shine through its cobwebby coating of grime, and making the faint heart  healthily merry. The close connection between the Thames and the Tyne is seen  in the names of the streets. Holborn, Wapping, Shadwell, are the last bits of  land the Tyneman leaves behind him, and they are the first to welcome him when  his coasting voyage is over. I pass &lsquo;Comical Corner,&rsquo; and a comical corner it  is. I peer into grimy, mouldy, tumble-down pubs; but there are no men in them  just now, and there are no signs of up-grown masculine humanity in street or  alley, on the beach or on the quays. Yes, here is one &mdash; a jolly, civil,  handsome pilot, who is doing the quarter-deck paces through an arc of four  strides&rsquo; stretch at a corner, so as to be half the time sheltered from the wind  and the other half in view of about two yards of river. He growls out &lsquo;Hard a  port!&rsquo; in answer to my sweetly intoned supplication for direction to the  lifeboat establishment. Accordingly I do &lsquo;hard a port,&rsquo; and tramping valiantly  through unpleasantly slippery slush, soon reach a wide beach almost covered with  pilot-boats still high and dry, although the tide has been &lsquo;making&rsquo; for hours  and cannot now be far from the full. To the left is a raised gangway, on which  two pilots &mdash; distinguishable from all possible nautical personages by the  spotted white muffler round the throat &mdash; are waddling up and down, apparently  lost in thought, and as unconcerned as if ships were myths and storms were  nightmares. Threading my way amongst the craft on the sandy beach, I arrive at  some wooden stairs, at the top whereof gleams a bright brass knob and a still  brighter brass knocker on an oak-painted door; and this door, I now remember,  admits to the private life of the most notable man connected with &lsquo;The Watch by  the Tyne&rsquo; &mdash; Captain Smith or Coxswain Smith or Superintendent Smith &mdash; for by  all these designations is he called, and by whatever name called he is always  safe to answer. I lift the knocker, and then bring it down with what I flatter  myself is a bang with something of a ship-ashore expression in it. The door  launches itself &lsquo;hard a starbit,&rsquo; as if answering to a powerful rudder; which  appears to be the case indeed, for it is the brawny arm of the captain himself  that has &lsquo;put it about.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have been  commissioned, Mr. Smith&rsquo; (and you see it was literally true, and I wasn&rsquo;t bound  to say who had commissioned me), I said when I got to the warmer side of the  oak-painted door &mdash; &lsquo;commissioned, Mr. Smith, to inquire into the efficiency of  the preventive service on the estuary of the Tyne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I am not a  coastguard, you understand, Mr. Muff,&rsquo; replied the gallant old gentleman,  drawing himself up to his full six feet and looking like a sailor king.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, I differ  with you, Mr. Smith; if you are not a coastguard, I wonder who is. The  unprincipled Nor&rsquo;-Easter, I take it, is the biggest old smuggler that uses  these parts, and does more harm to her Majesty&rsquo;s revenue, in the shape of  income-tax, than all other fraudulent free-traders put together; and if so, Mr.  Smith, I should like to know who has been a better preventive than yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, well, in that sense,  thank God, I&rsquo;ve done my part like another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How long have you been  at lifeboating, Mr. Smith &mdash; twenty years?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, more than that. I  have been superintendent for more than that; but I&rsquo;ve been at it more than  fifty years, as I may say, constant. I have gone out to two hundred and seven  wrecks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And how many lives have  you helped in rescuing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly <em>one thousand and one</em>. You see there,  that beautiful illuminated parchment in the handsome gold frame; well, that was  given me, together with a purse of thirty sovereigns, by the trustees of the  Lifeboat Fund at the end of my twenty-second year as one of the superintendents;  and then I&rsquo;ve these two silver medals &mdash; one from the Fisherman&rsquo;s Society, and  the other from the Royal Society for the Preservation of Life from Drowning.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what do you mean by  the Lifeboat Fund?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a voluntary  rate on all ships that come into port &mdash; voluntary and very trifling, but almost  always cheerfully paid along with the other dues at the Custom House; and out  of it are maintained our three boats and one on the north shore, just opposite,  under the Low Lighthouse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Very good. Now I should  like to examine the boat-house and the boats, and get an idea as to how you  work the thing in case of a wreck.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By all means, Mr. Muff,  and with very much pleasure. We&rsquo;re never ashamed; we&rsquo;re always <em>semper paratus</em> &mdash; that&rsquo;s Latin, you see,  sir, and it means, &ldquo;You never catch a weasel asleep.&rdquo;&rsquo; And the old gentleman  laughed his steeple-hat off his head, but cleverly catching it, he replaced it on  his silver-crowned pow; for a pilot is by nature a conservative in the matter  of hats. It is his only way of distinguishing himself at a great distance, I  suppose, from a mere captain. And down we go into the boat-stable below. On the  floor are two tramways; on each tramway there is a boat-carriage; on each  carriage is a huge boat painted a dull white; by the side of each boat is a  ladder; at one end the boat is attached by a rope to a winch, which serves to  haul it up when not on service, and by means of a patent drag on which men can  check the too rapid rush of the big fabric when she&rsquo;s off for duty. In front of  each boat are folding doors, and beyond, the little railway leads right down  into the river, so as to get depth enough at all stages of the tide. We mount  the ladder, and inspect the boat called Providence. Now, I have often seen this  boat bobbing up and down on the billows, and fancied it resembled a rather fat  nautilus &mdash; barring the sail &mdash; or an overgrown cockle struggling with adversity;  so that I am surprised to find a great expanse, with seats for a dozen rowers,  and room for a dozen extra hands, and room for vast coils of rope, and room for  twenty, or even thirty, half-dead sailors. She is thirty-four feet long, ten  feet ten inches wide, and three feet and a half deep. Here are the mighty oars  ready for shipping as soon as look. Here are the screws which work the valves  to let in the water by way of ballast. Here, quite handy, is the grappling-iron  &mdash; like Neptune&rsquo;s trident bent at the prongs &mdash; attached to a line made fast to  the boat. All along the length of the benches is a rope, which the men grab  hold of when a heavier sea than common breaks over them. And all round the  outside there is a similar hand-catch or hold-fast for men who may be washed  overboard. Here also is a life-preserver, resembling two black mallets joined  at their handles, and attached to a line. Here, again, are holes amidships,  right through the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Smith,&rsquo; I exclaim,  &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you would venture out in this thing, with three  great holes in her bottom? Why, I can see the ground through them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And why not, or why  otherwise?&rsquo; rejoins the knowing old super; &lsquo;why shouldn&rsquo;t I? Don&rsquo;t you see, we  like to balance her, so as to keep her head yonder well out of the water; but  when a sea breaks over her, down rushes the water &mdash; and down it would rush to  the hinder end of the boat, already low enough in the trough of the last sea;  then where would we be?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo;  I meekly reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I do; leastways, I  can give a guess, you know. I hope we should be all right; but it wouldn&rsquo;t be  long for this world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, then, what&rsquo;s that  got to do with the holes?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just this; look here,  you see this trap-door under the front bench? Well, that lets the wave through  so as it doesn&rsquo;t stop at the foreport and lower her head, but bangs away  through. But now look here; under this bench the trap-door is reversed &mdash; the  wave shuts it, just as it opened the other. What&rsquo;s the consequence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure, Mr. Smith, I  don&rsquo;t know&rsquo;; you all go to the bottom, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a bit of it. The  wave stops short, all of a heap, in the middle of the boat, where it doesn&rsquo;t so  much matter. Then, when the next sea gives us a bit of a hoist, out passes the  wave through the big holes, and scampers off to swell the tempest outside.  Don&rsquo;t you see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think I do, Mr. Smith;  but look you. When you take off a lot of fellows from a wreck, the boat must  settle down a goodish bit into the water, and then the sea will come up through  the holes, won&rsquo;t it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To be sure and certainly  it will; but what of that? It seldom comes up more than an inch or two, and  we&rsquo;re not very particular as to a feet-wetting.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So far good. Quite  intelligible, very sagacious, but not pleasant. But what are these lilliputian  life-preservers, Mr. Smith?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Them? them&rsquo;s grummets,  my dear sir. We work the oars with grummets. It&rsquo;s handier, and easy replaced if  we lose one. You see the ring of rope goes round the oar and round the pin,  instead of having rowlocks. And here&rsquo;s spare oars; and this is a hatchet for  cutting loose when we&rsquo;ve got the men; and over the stern here you see our  lantern, which shows a red light, so that the other boats can see if we are  ahead.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Which you mostly are, I  guess.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s not for me to  say; but I believe it&rsquo;s not often the other way.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so out of the boat;  for I begin to feel damp, sea-sick, and shipwrecky. Standing between the boats  in a semi-supine and deeply-meditative attitude, I ask Mr. Smith to indulge me with  a bit of preraphaelite realism.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now suppose, just  suppose, Mr. Smith, that the Castor guns were to fire at this identical moment,  what would take place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, in less than five  minutes, the Providence would be rounding the sea-wall yonder, with four-and-twenty  men aboard of her.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Impossible!&rsquo; I exclaim,  &lsquo;because there are only three men beside yourself within bugle-call. I dare  take my davy of it, for I made a point of looking all about as I came along.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; cries Captain  Smith, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s that? Here they come; clear out! Now you&rsquo;ll see.&rsquo;</p>
<p>A noise as of many  public-houses disgorging at midnight &mdash; a rush like a torrent &mdash; a roar like a  big wave on a pebbly beach &mdash; and in come a host of struggling, panting,  shouting, screaming men, as if Bedlam were broken loose. One over the other,  pushing, ramming, jamming &mdash; like a flock of sheep through a gap in a garden  hedge &mdash; fifty great hulking fellows, if there is one of them! Up they clamber  into the Providence; and in a moment the cry is, &lsquo;No more, not one; we&rsquo;re  full.&rsquo; The big doors are flung open. The men stand up grasping their oars and  intently looking out across the river for the lightning flash and white puff of  the signal-gun. Long before the boom can reach their ears, they will be in full  swing for the water. Men are at the winch. Men are at the front, hammers in  hand, to knock away at one blow the wedges that stay the boat-carriage. In  another moment they will be off. They wait but for the white puff. But it comes  not. It&rsquo;s a mistake.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, it isn&rsquo;t. I saw the  schooner take the ground on the Black Middens; but I reckon she&rsquo;s off, so I&rsquo;ll  be off too,&rsquo; cries one bluff pilot; and when he has said it he disembarks, and  the rest soon follow his example.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Might have come any day  for a score of years, ay for a hundred years, sir, and not seen exactly such a  sight as this. Mostly the gun fires first; but being daylight, you see, they  saw the ship ground, then raised the call, and ran straight for the boat; and  then, as Pete says, the Castor look-out must have seen the schooner lift again  and get away clear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But where in the world  did all the men come from?&rsquo; I inquire.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, but, how shall I say?&rsquo;  replies Mr. Smith: &lsquo;from under the boats there, from round the corner, from the  pilots&rsquo; &ldquo;look-out,&rdquo; perhaps, on the Lawe, only they must have run down on  speculation. Bless you, we&rsquo;re always wide awake. There&rsquo;s never been an hour or  a quarter of an hour for a hundred years, I daresay, when there wasn&rsquo;t scores  of men awake and on the look-out, some for one cause and some for another. But  life, at the mouth of a river like this, is all watches. If some&rsquo;s in their  bunks, others is up and about. Not only police and pilots and suchlike, but all  sorts of men, for one thing or another, or nothing at all &mdash; just a kind of  habit like.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And as he speaks we  approach a jetty which commands a view of the whole estuary, and the bar, and  the piers in process of building to enclose the estuary in great part from the  previously unbroken violence of the wind-driven waves. From this point we can  see the Black Middens, or at least the foam of the billows that unceasingly  break on those sullen crags. And here comes the schooner so lately in peril.  The crew are leaning over the side, and waving their caps in grateful recognition  of our promptitude, of which, as they pass, they can readily judge. And as I  lift my eyes across the Narrows, I see the crew of the guard-ship Castor  clustered on the forecastle; and the lifeboat-house doors open on the other  side, as they were and still are on ours. Their boat is beached outside, and  the men are strolling leisurely back to their picturesque hut on the sands,  whence they keep night and day a snug look-out. Far away, and up among the  cliffs near the Black Middens, is a boat-house, in which is a National  Society&rsquo;s lifeboat. There the doors are open, and men are grouped around, as if  half disappointed of a chance of showing their prowess and skill. And round the  headland, Mr. Smith tells me, is another of the National boats; and he can a-warrant  me, that he can, that if the gun had gone off, there would have been help from  that quarter too. So that on a mere chance of a ship not being able to clear  the ill-fated rocks, not fewer than five lifeboats were manned, and ready to  push off in the twinkle of an eye or the flash of a gun. Brave, all-daring,  naught-dreading heroes! It could not be money that thus dragged them into peril  and hardship. The most that they could expect was a few shillings, and some  would get nothing. But over and above the natural compassion of humanity, and  the strong personal sympathy arising from the thought that any day the danger  may encompass themselves, it seems to me that there is a spirit of proud  defiance, and a burning desire to hurl back the challenge of the angry sea in  its very teeth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And you have been two  hundred and seven times into yon foaming waters, Captain Smith?&rsquo; I exclaim in  tones of amazement.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yon? Yes, but yon&rsquo;s  baby-play to what it mostly is. Let but this wind get up to a gale, as is  likely enough in a few hours, then add to it darkness as black as ink, and you  may form some idea of what it generally is. Eh, mon, many and many a time have  I lain out amongst moving mountains of waves half a night, and seen great ships  in the death-thraw, and heard the cry of the poor fellows in the rigging like  the squeal of sea-mews in the blast, and wept to think that even with a  lifeboat such as ours there was no possibility of saving them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I suppose you have had  narrow escapes yourself, captain?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, yes, I&rsquo;ve had as  near goes as most men, to say I never did go, you know. Once especially, bless  the Almighty! I may say I was saved by a miracle. It was my duty to go in  command of the boat; but I had been laid up with two broken ribs I got the last  time we were out; and when I took my place in her, the men all said I shouldn&rsquo;t  go &mdash; wasn&rsquo;t strong enough yet, and so on. Well, my poor brother, he it was that  took my place; and off they went, and a terrible night it was; and they got  near the ship on the Herd, but were driven back again and again; and at last a  great sea fell back from the ship right over them, and swept the whole  twenty-four of them into the boiling surf. Poor Robert, he died in my stead;  and strange to say, this very day his eldest son lies dead, and that&rsquo;s why our  blinds are down. But I&rsquo;ve had my share &mdash; perhaps hardly that, though,  considering the time I&rsquo;ve been at it. I have been swept out of the boat, and  hung on till three of my fingers were broken. I have been lifted up by a wave  clean away from the boat, but my mate caught my trousers by the leg. The bit  gave way; but it checked my headway just enough to make me flop on the deck,  instead of shooting out into the sea. Ah, well, bless the Lord! it might easy  ha&rsquo; been worse, and many&rsquo;s the time I wonder it wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s over now. I&rsquo;m  seventy-two years old, and I&rsquo;m not to go out any more. All I&rsquo;ve got to do is to  see that the boats are all right &mdash; at least those two &mdash; for we&rsquo;ve another a  mile away on the sand at the other side of the pier.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve nothing to  do with the Life Brigade?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m a member of it,  and often used to help the coastguard before the volunteer movement came in.  But of course it&rsquo;s more honorary now than anything else, except, perhaps, a bit  of good counsel, which is not to be despised.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;From a man that has been  at the saving of a thousand lives, I should say not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That&rsquo;s one way of  putting it; but if I&rsquo;d saved never a one, still I know the ways of the sea &mdash; better,  ay, far better, than I know my own. Would you like to inspect the Brigade-house  and the apparatus? It isn&rsquo;t very far. Or perhaps you&rsquo;d like to see it in right  earnest some night? You can&rsquo;t go out in the lifeboat, but you may see a bit of  the rocket-work. The glass is going down, and it feels windy like. If you&rsquo;re  stopping in the town one night, you might get a chance.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Certainly, I should  greatly like to understand all about it; and if it promises badly to-night,  I&rsquo;ll stop and see what I can. But I won&rsquo;t trouble you, Joe &mdash; I mean Captain  Smith. Mr. Wilson knows me; and he will, I am sure, as far as his duties  permit, give me every facility and every information. So, for the present, many  thanks; and farewell, my honest and true-hearted friend; and when life&rsquo;s wrecks  and rescues are over, may we meet in the quiet haven!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Brave old Joe! I should  like to have broken my pledge for the sake of giving him a wee sup of toddy;  but I should as soon have thought of proposing to make a night of it with the  Archbishop of Canterbury. So I left him with his clear and bright gray eye to  continue his &lsquo;watch by the Tyne.&rsquo;</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2<br>
  With The Life Brigade</strong></h3>
<p>Like the tide, I am  ebbing from Boat-house beach in a slow and vacillating fashion, which, upon the  whole, resolves itself into a retreat along the way by which I came. Shall I  make for the sea, as an ebbing tide should, and commence my other tasks in the <em>de inquirendo</em> line without farther delay?  That would be a spirited piece of martyrdom in the public service, considering  how my inner man aches and yearns with hunger. Yet, hungry as I am, the line  must be drawn somewhere. I draw it at the salt herrings, &lsquo;claggum,&rsquo; exploded  cocoa-nuts, locusts, and ship-biscuits, which constitute the commissariat of  &lsquo;Comical Corner&rsquo; and its tragical environs. Would that I had a friend &mdash; an  oasis, so to speak, in this desert of slush and smells! Yet if I had, I should  fight shy of him, if he asked me to refect in this street. What a pity  friendship cannot be extemporised! Let me see: there&rsquo;s the mission ship  anchored in the stream and out of reach of the smells. The chaplain is bound,  by virtue of his modest stipend, to show hospitality to all mariners in  distress. My distress is undoubted; and as to being a mariner, have I not just  escaped from a shipwreck? Besides, the mission ship, I am told, is a sort of  head-quarters for nautical movements of every conceivable description.  Accordingly I make for the gangway which leads from the shore to the bonny  frigate &mdash; christened Diamond when launched for the wars, and rechristened  Joseph Straker when consecrated to peace and goodwill. A magnificent deckhouse  stands amidships, like a conservatory at sea. In it are a score of sailors,  conning the papers, playing at chess or draughts, or reading library books,  each and all with a weather eye wide open, and intent on the weather, which,  fortunately for me, begins to look &lsquo;dorty.&rsquo; Below, on the main deck, is the  church &mdash; a neat and snug place of worship on Sundays, but often on week-days  the scene of pleasant and instructive reunions, not quite up to the Sunday  standard in a formally dogmatic point of view, but, I am told, very helpful  withal in that direction. On the gun-deck is the recreation and smoking room of  this splendid sailors&rsquo; club; and here also the memory of Sebastopol, whereat  the good Diamond showed battle, is revived by vigorous tea-fights at suitable  intervals. Speedily finding myself on the ship&rsquo;s books in the matter of  rations, and slinging my hammock, by a figure of speech, I invite statistics  from the chaplain and demi-chaplain of the ship-church on the matters which  have brought me to the mouth of the Tyne. They know all about everything &mdash; all  things in heaven as well as on earth concerned in nautical philosophy; but on  the points of rescue and saving and restoring, it stands to reason that they  should be uncommonly well informed. They regard lifeboatmen, life-brigadesmen,  and all sailors snatched from the perils of storm, as comprised in their cure  of souls; and they seem to take for granted that handling real yarn  rocket-ropes is as much a part of their functions as the yarn-spinning process  with which clerics are more particularly identified. They tell me that on the  north side the brigade numbers 144 men; that they have above 100 on the south  side; and that there is as earnest and as good-natured a rivalry between the  two bodies as there is between the north and south lifeboats; that all services  are strictly gratuitous, except certain allowances in victuals while on actual  duty; that the coast-guard superintend the parade-drill and the  rocket-practice, and cooperate somewhat directorally in every instance of  service, but otherwise are a distinct force.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Mr. Muff &mdash; if  you&rsquo;ll pardon me for calling you by your right name &mdash; have a cup of coffee,&rsquo;  says the chaplain, &lsquo;and come with us; for there is no longer any manner of  doubt that we shall be in for a night of it; and in that case, you can see and  judge for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding an  involuntary shivery-shivery shake all over both body and soul at the bare  mention of the thing, I gather up my rather undisciplined physical courage  sufficiently to reply, that &lsquo;Nothing could possibly be more agreeable to my  feelings than to witness a few horrible shipwrecks.&rsquo; Of course I didn&rsquo;t mean  that; but for that very reason I said it, as is my unfortunate wont.</p>
<p>The shades of night and the  barometer alike are falling. The wind and the sea are rising, rising, rising.  We sally forth in wrap-rascals and seal-skin caps and india-rubber overalls;  the chaplaincy armed with, spiritual weapons I suppose, and I with a  pocket-pistol, which in case of extreme need may be converted into a revolver,  but which at present is designed only as a medicament for the rescued, if  rescued there should be. We climb the wind-swept heights, and peer out on the  steel-gray sky and sullen sea. Within the bar to the right and to the left the  water is of the hue of dull gold; but it is ribbed with snow-white ridges, and  against rock or pier it breaks, now into a blast of snow-flakes, and now into  jets of steam. The roar is as if a mighty city were being bombarded, and at the  same time both assaulted and defended with countless small-arms. By the time we  reach the South Pier, there is little light left but the phosphoric flash of  ten thousand breakers on the far-stretching sands. Here stands the Brigade  house, frail enough to look at, but deftly built for its work, and  weather-proof, and a good deal more than that. The last time I saw it was on a  bright sunny evening in the summer, and then it was musical with psalms, or  hushed in the solemnity of prayer. Pilots and fisherfolk were at their  devotions, and the chaplain, who is now like a bundle of bearskins by my side,  was leading their worship with quiet good taste and a fervour that told on  their souls. Now all is changed. It is like a den of lions awaiting their prey  and panting for strife. The older ones, shaggy and gruff, are prowling round  and round, watchful but patient; the younger ones in and out, but principally  in, and unanimously smoking. They number in all not far short of a hundred, not  counting such lubbers as myself. Beneath all manner of sea-worthy costume, the  uniform of the Brigade is discernible in the reek-dimmed gas-light. The  officers are distinguished by a broad armlet of white leather; the  loose-fitting guernsey and the pipe-clayed belt give a semi-sailorish look to the  amphibious rank and file of young civilians, who are bent on showing the  profession what maritime landsmen can do when seamen can do no more, and hope  and effort alike are dead. Their talk is salty and sharp. When Tom Bowling and  old Marlinspike pretend not to be listening, the younkers talk big and loud;  but a shrug from those brawny old shoulders or a cast from those space-piercing  eyes is a signal for reverent silence. And here is Mr. Wilson; but what of that?  For when is he not here? He devotes all his leisure to the place, and in a  cause so dear to his heart it is no wonder that he classes all his waking  hours, and the majority of his sleeping hours, under the head of &lsquo;leisure,&rsquo; &mdash; such  as it is. He is not exactly commander-in-chief; he is rather the barrack-master  of the Brigade, and has charge of the stores. He shows me his cupboards, and  lockers, and kitchen, and pantry, and wardrobe, and surgery or apothecary&rsquo;s  shop. All is in apple-pie order, especially the victualling department, and the  room for the reception and treatment of the poor shipwrecked ones who may be  expected any hour. Space would fail me &mdash; not to mention my memory &mdash; if I  attempted to say more than that I endeavoured to show off, by suggesting some  modification or addition to the arrangements, but ignominiously failed in the  effort.</p>
<p>Time wears on in a  feverish way till ten o&rsquo;clock. By this time the excitement has become intense,  for more than one of the ships made out before night fell must now be close on  the harbour-mouth. The lookouts are on the alert, and rumours are flapping  about that vessels have been seen. The moon is overdue, and if the clouds would  but lift for a moment, what a relief it would be! But as yet there is naught to  be seen through the rain-spattered window save one&rsquo;s own jaded face, and an  infinite blackness beyond.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There she goes!&rsquo; cries  the barrack-master; and again and again the boom of big guns bursts through the  deep diapason of wind-driven billows. Quick as thought the Castor takes up the  solemn <em>rappel</em>, and all the Tyne Watch  is up and astir. The boats are not wanted, for they could not get round the  South Pier with seas like molten mountains racing over the bar; and we know  from the triple signal that ours is the call to duty. Off, then, and away! Away  down the long, long pier &mdash; full half a mile down. Down, where as yet the works  are unfinished, and the sea, rushing in from below, pours in vast cataracts  right athwart our path every minute. Ah, here she is, sure enough, and not very  far to the suth&rsquo;ard. A signal is being made from her bows &mdash; a  Jack-o&rsquo;-lantern-like flash, but exceedingly dim to inexperienced eyesight. In a  moment the apparatus is pitched, the rocket is placed in its carriage on the  tripod, the line is made fast to the rocket. At the word of command, the rocket  is fired, and away it leaps like some ministering spirit, &lsquo;a flame of fire,&rsquo; an  eager, resolute, irresistible messenger of mercy and help to men who in a few  minutes more would, but for such timely intervention, have been swept into the  angry surf and dashed to death upon the rocks. We are not always as clever, it  seems, as we show ourselves tonight. There is no hitch of any kind. All goes  well. The aim was good, the men on board are expert. For them it is a question  of life or death, and that question must be settled in less than ten minutes.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Heave ahoy, boys; pull,  pull away, pull with a will!&rsquo; And pulling they are with a quiet business-like  regularity of stroke, hand over hand, that is worth all the bustle and fuss in  the world.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Here he is, &mdash; why,  here&rsquo;s a couple!&rsquo; A white-faced, long-haired laddie, and a thick-set old tar as  purple in the face, unless the lantern has coloured glass in it, as the soaked  toggery in which he is incased. Off with them to the house! And off with the  life-buoy and line once more to the ship! This time it is a couple of corpses  to all appearance. They have been so chilled to begin with, and so soused by  the envious waves as we dragged them home, that they cannot speak, and are slow  to breathe. Off with them to warmth and light and steaming hot coffee, or, if  needs be, something stronger than that. Ah, how provident of me! Here, my good  fellows, let me pass! I bring a teetotaler&rsquo;s best blessing to exhausted human  nature, &mdash; a drop of the real stuff distilled from the dew and the heather of  famed Glenlivat. How grateful the poor fellows seem! How naturally they take to  it! I wonder if they ever tasted it before! Now up with them both, and off as  fast as you can trot. And so we proceed, till thirteen men and the fair-haired  laddie are all safe in the snuggery of the cosy brigade-house. There they have  been nursed and re-clothed and fed, and now they are smoking &mdash; all but the laddie  &mdash; in a thoughtful way that is not yet wholly free from the shadow of death.  Very gently the chaplain puts it to them whether they would like to unite with  him in a brief service of praise for their deliverance from death. Every head  is bowed down, every pipe is laid aside; presently every knee is piously bent,  and every eye is filled with salt-water that never came from the sea. When this  is over, and they have told the tale of their danger and repeated their thanks  to those who have been so willingly the instruments of Heaven, they pass out,  warmly wrapped up, on their way to lodgings hard by, to forget their fatigues  and dream of their shipwreck, and wake to find themselves safe.</p>
<p>It is the noon of the  night. The storm is more furious than ever, and gives no sign of abating. It is  advisable that a portion of the Brigade should retire to their homes, and turn  in for two or three hours, so as to be ready to relieve the others by and by.  Some fifty or sixty remain, and in brief season each man is supplied with a  pint of good coffee, a couple of ship-biscuits, and a hunk of ship-beef.  Sometimes they have soup instead of coffee, and cheese instead of beef. The  midnight meal is making satisfactory progress &mdash; nay some of us, being hard set  as respects the biscuits and sundry teeth that are sleeping the sleep of slow  corruption in the show-bowls of advertising dentists, have made an end of  feasting already &mdash; when the common-room door flies open with a bang, as if the  storm itself were coming in for its supper, and a mighty sea-porpoise, shining  with wet waterproof from head to foot, straddles in, and in a hoarse voice and  husky exclaims:</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pretty set of chaps  you are for a brigade, and be blowed to you! Do you call this a look-out,  guzzling and gluttonising and warming your lazy bones!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now,  Andrew? Never mind the preaching,&rsquo; is the mild and fatherly remonstrance of Mr.  Quick. &lsquo;Out with it, man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, here&rsquo;s the  Pathfinder tug a-been signalling ye all along the pier; but never a light ye  showed. So when she come abreast of the lifeboat, a man came ashore to say as  she&rsquo;d broke her tow-rope off Marsden, and a Proosian full rigger she had in tow  &rsquo;s gone slick into Dead Man&rsquo;s Hole.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All right, Andrew, my  man. Who&rsquo;s off for the cliffs?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Many shout, and some  volunteer. We who are finished, though not full, are manifestly most at  liberty. So, provided with blue-lights, that we may signal the Brigade to fetch  up the rocket-gear in case we light on the ship, away we trudge. The trudging  soon changes to a trot, and the trot to a race. Our force is thereby scattered;  but only let us find the lost ship, and that will be rendezvous enough for us  all. The cliffs are lofty and the path runs perilously near the edge; but the  wind is almost as good as a sea-wall. You might lean against it without losing  your balance over the precipice. There is a ghostly shimmer on the sounding  sea. The moon is up, but thickly veiled, and her rays fall in a diffused  twilight on the stormy scene. When we have run about a mile, we call little  halts, and peer out into the gloom and down amongst the rocks, and scan the  gleaming white fringe along the creeks and bays to the suth&rsquo;ard. But all in  vain. Not a mast, not a yard, not a hull breaks upon our straining eyeballs.  Mr. Muff&rsquo;s imagination is by far the liveliest in all the picket, though I say  it that perhaps shouldn&rsquo;t; and the consequence is, that he raises false hopes  in the bosoms of his fellow-pioneers every few yards of the way. &lsquo;There she is;  no, she isn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;I see her; no, I don&rsquo;t.&rsquo; &lsquo;Hollo, there&rsquo;s no mistake this  time.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes, there is.&rsquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, I should like to know?&rsquo; &lsquo;Not a ship,  anyhow.&rsquo; Such are the exclamations which every moment or two rudely interrupt  the steady roar of the blast and the heavy thunder of the sea. Still nothing is  made out. At last we reach a point from which, with the moon now peeping through  a rift in the clouds, we can command the coast-line for miles. Glasses are out.  To me they serve only to blot out what moonlight there is, and to make the  darkness painfully visible. Other fellows pretend they can use them with  advantage. It is not for me to deny it; but I take the freedom to doubt. So  after a two hours&rsquo; chase of the phantom ship, we sit down behind the  tumble-down walls of a broken old shanty; and having recovered our own wind, we  return to give battle to the furious wind from the &lsquo;norrard.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And all this while a poor  numb sailor was fighting with death in the whirlpools of Dead Man&rsquo;s Hole. Hours  later on he managed to crawl up the heights, and dragging his stiffened limbs  to a farm-house, where the inmates were early astir, he was welcomed,  sheltered, and comforted by cannie English bodies, who knew not a word of the  stranger&rsquo;s lingo. Others, wise in the tongues, subsequently ascertained from  him that the ill-starred vessel had broken up into drift-wood in Dead Man&rsquo;s  Hole, and, so far as he knew, he alone, of eleven, escaped to tell. As for our  reconnoitring party, it arrived in all safety but small comfort at the  brigade-house, a little before the pale dawn crept up the eastern sky. Very  fortunately the staff we left behind when we set forth on our fruitless  expedition had been able to carry on without our aid. While we had been  spending our strength for naught, they had watched and toiled to good purpose.  Seven rescued ones &mdash; one the fair young wife of the skipper of the Flora &mdash; were  the trophies over which we found them exulting when we got back. As the day  came on, the storm went down. It had made its cruel assault, and done some  irreparable harm. But happily it had delivered its heaviest blows at points  well prepared to resist them; and so, baffled and quite sulkily sobbing with  shame for its frequent defeat, the storm-fiend withdrew, to bide his time and  whet his revenge &mdash; leaving rich spoil of saved lives in the hands of &lsquo;The Tyne  Watch.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="BadenInArgovie"></a>Baden In Argovie</strong></h2>
<p>However well acquainted  most of us may be with the peaks, passes, and glaciers of Switzerland &mdash; those &lsquo;palaces  of Nature pinnacled in the clouds&rsquo; &mdash; and with the various attractive localities  to be found in that interesting and picturesque country, the generality of  travellers are probably ignorant of the circumstance that the healing waters of  the earth have chosen this already so highly favoured region as one of their  special domains. Beneath those mountains and valleys which the tourist so  eagerly treads, and among which he lingers in pursuit of pleasure or health,  lie a larger variety of mineral springs than, relatively to its extent, perhaps  any country can boast. According to a work lately published by M. Max Wirth, of  the Statistical Department of Berne, Switzerland possesses no less than 609  medicinal springs, 424 of which have been analysed by experienced hands, and  found to include nearly every ingredient of which mineral waters are composed.  These are dispensed by 62 establishments, open to the public during the usual  orthodox period, ranging from the 1st of May to the 1st of November.</p>
<p>Fashion, which is all  supreme in most mundane matters, and which asserts no inconsiderable sway over  watering-places in particular, has not failed to influence the destiny of these  resorts of the invalid and the idler. Thus some baths which in former times  could count among their regular visitors many persons distinguished by birth,  social rank, or fortune, are now only frequented either exclusively by the  lower classes, or by a very restricted number of habitues; while others again,  which in days gone by were scarcely known by name, have in their turn attained  a wide-spread celebrity.</p>
<p>Baden in the canton of  Argovie, the most ancient of all the Swiss baths, presents a striking example  of these fluctuations of popular favour. It lies between two chains of the  Jura, and is built on the banks of the river Limmat, whose waters rush through  the narrow defile within which the town is confined. Numbers of invalids come  every year to seek the benefit of its warm sulphurous waters, and none of the  many mineral springs of Switzerland enjoys a greater reputation in a medical  point of view. But the lovers of pleasure will find nothing here to recall the  splendid gilded saloons, the beautiful gardens, and the many varied attractions  of Baden Baden, Wiesbaden, or Hombourg; and as we saunter slowly along under  the shady trees by the river, or pace the streets of the now quiet little town,  it is difficult to realise that this Swiss Baden, two hundred years ago, was  also a centre of luxury, dissipation, and amusement, a favourite resort of the gay  and fashionable, and occupied,for the wealthy idlers of those days, a position  not unlike that which is now filled by its brilliant namesake on the banks of  the Oos.</p>
<p>The fame of this ancient  watering-place has been handed down to us from the days of Nero, and Tacitus  speaks of it as &lsquo;In modum municipii extractus locus amoeno salubrium acquarum  usu frequens.&rsquo; Indeed, several springs on both sides of the river, and in the  bed of the Limmat itself, seem to have been well known and much frequented in  those early days.</p>
<p>Without following up the history  of Baden through the successive centuries which followed, we will at once turn  to the palmy days which began to dawn for these ancient baths in 1422, from  which period, up to 1712, the members of the Confederation held their  Tagsatzungen or Diets annually at this town, received ambassadors from foreign  courts, and were the means of attracting many personages of distinction to the  picturesque banks of the Limmat. Here, too, the joys and sorrows of life were  mournfully contrasted in the pleasant intervals of holiday-making, which  enlivened the gatherings of the Councils of Constance (1414-1418) and Basle  (1431-1449), when so many scions of noble houses and distinguished prelates  came to Baden &mdash; &lsquo;For the purpose&rsquo; (to quote an old chronicler) &lsquo;of lightening  their hearts, made somewhat heavy by the labours of the Council.&rsquo; In the sad  hours of grief when Huss was expiating on the stake at Constance the crime of  too great a devotion to his faith (1415), Anastasia von Hohenklingen, abbess of  the Fraueum&uuml;nster Convent at Zurich, was bartering her broad lands, with all  their rights and privileges, in order to pay for a sojourn among the pleasant  places of Baden; and again, at the very time when Jerome of Prague had won his  crown of martyrdom (1416), Poggio,* who had witnessed his trial and death, was  feasting his eyes on the charms of the fair Helvetian belles, who thronged  this fashionable watering-place. In these jarring contrasts we have a perfect  picture of the spirit of that age, and Poggio&rsquo;s celebrated letter to Nicolo  Nicoli is stamped with the frivolity which was one of its chief  characteristics. He was among those who, in 1414, accompanied Pope John XXIII.  to the Council of Constance; but he was subsequently obliged to leave the papal  suite, and have recourse to the waters of Baden, in the hopes of curing an  obstinate attack of gout. He gives a curious account of the mode of life and  the recreations in fashion at the time in these Thermae Helvetica, and his  letter is the more interesting as it is the first printed record of Baden  memorabilia extant.</p>
<p class="note">* Poggio, surnamed  Bracciolini, was one of the great promoters of the sciences in the fifteenth  century, and for forty years held the post of secretary to ten successive  popes.</p>
<p>Even at this early epoch  there were as many as thirty hostelries in the town and neighbourhood, each  establishment having its separate bath &mdash; an artificial basin somewhat rudely  excavated in the earth to the depth of a few feet, one portion of which was  open to the general public, and capable of containing a great number of  bathers, while the remaining section was set apart for private use. Two larger  basins or open ponds, respectively entitled &lsquo;St. Verena&rsquo; and &lsquo;Freibad,&rsquo;  occupied nearly the whole of the public square where the various inns displayed  their hospitable signboards. Here men and women of all ages, belonging to the  peasant classes, disported themselves, the sexes being merely divided by a  wooden partition of close trellis work. The public baths belonging to the  various inns were fitted with a similar barrier, but, like the lattice-windows  in the harems of the East, full provision was made for conversation or  curiosity by introducing in the fragile wall of separation several movable  apertures. Ample space was left around the basins to receive the various  friends or acquaintances of the bathers, and as the admission was free, these  spaces were generally crowded. Men and women frequently bathed together in the  open baths, such an intermixture of the sexes not being considered indecorous.*  On such occasions, however, the men wore a long linen bathing-cloak, the dress  of the women consisting of a similar linen garment reaching below the knee, but  leaving the neck and arms exposed. A square floating board, with which each  bath was provided, served as a table for all who desired to partake of  refreshments, and indeed, in those baths where the two sexes met in  unrestrained freedom, regular encampments, so to speak, were held daily, and  such extemporised tables were of the first necessity. The bathers visited these  basins from two to three times a day, remaining several hours in the water.  Thus a greater part of the twenty-four hours being spent in the bath, it was  soon found necessary to provide some means of amusement beyond that afforded by  the conviviality of the table, and games and round dances were speedily  instituted and became very popular.</p>
<p class="note">* At Loueche, in the  Valais, the same custom is in force at the present day. The public baths  contain from fifteen to twenty persons of both sexes, and of all ranks and  ages, who, clothed in long dark woollen dresses, spend daily from four to eight  hours in the water. Refreshments, newspapers, books, &amp;c. are placed upon  floating tables for the benefit of the bather&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>In the baths frequented  by the upper classes, it was customary for ladies visited by gentlemen to exact  a small sum of money from the latter called &lsquo;Almosen&rsquo; (alms), and frequently  the male visitors presented wreaths of flowers to the fair occupants, and  placed them on their heads with all due ceremony, to the accompaniment of  harps, fifes, and trumpets.**</p>
<p class="note">** <em>Die Heilquellen und Kurorte der Schweiz</em>, by Dr. Meyer Ahrens.</p>
<p>At the elbow formed by  the river, and on its left bank below the baths, may still be seen a small meadow  called &lsquo;die Matte,&rsquo; now partly turned into a vegetable garden, but which was  formerly completely shaded by fine trees. This once romantic spot was in olden  times the trysting place of the bathers, who usually assembled here after  supper and whiled away the hours in every kind of recreation.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that  this gay life should have attracted many visitors to Baden, beyond those who  frequented the waters in search of health; and accordingly we find that people  streamed in large numbers to this captivating locality from a circuit of about  one hundred and fifty miles, a considerable distance in those days, when roads  were few in number and indifferently constructed. They were a motley company,  composed of princes, nobles, burghers, peasants, abbots, priests, monks, and  nuns, and Baden was then the centre of luxury and display. Velvets, silks, and  satins fluttered in the breeze; gold, silver, and precious stones gleamed by  day on the banks of the Limmat, and by night in the magnificently illuminated  ball-rooms. The concourse of people collected there rather resembled a  brilliant court than a gathering of watering-place visitors.</p>
<p>The arrangements made for  receiving these guests were, however, scarcely on a scale commensurate with  their riches or social standing. In 1478-80 only two hotels, and those not  remarkable for comfort, were principally resorted to &mdash; the Stadthof and  Hinterhof, both kept by men of gentle birth, who thought it below their dignity  to allow of food being cooked for their visitors. They merely condescended to  let apartments and baths for a specified time, and the guests were obliged to look  to other establishments for their meals. A considerable improvement appears to  have taken place in this respect towards the middle of the sixteenth century,  for the celebrated naturalist, Konrad Gessner, writing at this period (1553),  states that &lsquo;nowhere in Europe had he met with greater luxury and comfort than  at Baden.&rsquo; This progress steadily increased, and in the year 1578 Dr. Panta-leon  of Basle, in a work which gives an amusing account of Baden and of the mode of  life and fashion there, mentions no less than twelve hotels and forty-one baths  in the town. Michel de Montaigne, two years later, describes these  establishments as <em>logis tr&egrave;s magnifiques</em>,  and gives the first account of the institution of the table-d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te at Baden.  This was held at the Stadthof and Hinterhof, which still took the lead among  the hotels of the town. The Margrave Frederick of Brandenburg was among the  guests who partook of the good fare at these tables.</p>
<p>Life at Baden at this  time, notwithstanding the efforts of the Reformation to put a stop to its  freedom and frivolity, was still characterised by great excesses, and though  the votaries of Venus were not wanting, Bacchus was the deity principally  worshipped. Pantaleon tells us, that the &lsquo;Herrenbad&rsquo; at the Stadthof, a basin  capable of holding twenty persons, usually contained an oddly contrasted  collection of occupants, noblemen and burghers, Catholics and Protestants, each  of whom in turn was obliged to give a breakfast to the bathers at six o&rsquo;clock  in the morning; for most of the company having by this time been assembled for  some hours, &lsquo;they required a little refreshment, and could no longer do without  some sort of beverage.&rsquo; Drinking was carried on to such an extent, that  Pantaleon found it necessary to limit each bather to two pints of wine. Prayers  were said both before and after breakfast, &mdash; a short song was then sung to &lsquo;mine  host,&rsquo; the burden of which was the wish that he might live many years and be an  example of honour to the world. The next breakfast-giver was then elected,  crowned with a wreath, and duly warned that he would be serenaded on the  following day with trumpets and fifes. In order to restrain within due limits  the ever increasing liberty of manners, a formal tribunal was instituted,  composed of the leading habitues of the &lsquo;Herrenbad,&rsquo; whose jurisdiction  extended over all the baths in the town. Every visitor (&lsquo;Mitbadende&rsquo; or  &lsquo;Badgeselle,&rsquo; as they were called) was obliged to touch the president&rsquo;s wand  with the left hand, and promise due obedience to him. The sittings of the court  were held after the morning meal, and each case of violation of public decorum  was investigated and promptly punished. The penalties consisted of fines, which  were partly distributed to the poor and partly added to a fund designed to purchase  provisions and wine for the common use. Besides these breakfasts, it was  understood that each visitor, at the expiration of his stay, was to give a  farewell public entertainment. The &lsquo;Frauenbad&rsquo; in the Stadthof, capable of  holding thirty women, was also amenable to the &lsquo;Herrenbad&rsquo; tribunal.</p>
<p>Besides these baths, the  Stadthof contained three large basins to which both sexes had access, one  called the &lsquo;Kessel,&rsquo; holding fifty, and the other two forty persons. In the  Kessel the water was sufficiently deep to reach to the chest of a man. This  bath was held in great repute, being especially efficacious in cases of  lameness and contraction of the limbs.</p>
<p>It would be tedious to go  through the whole list of baths which Baden numbered at this period, and the &lsquo;Herrenbad&rsquo;  has been described in detail, merely in order to give the reader an idea of the  manners and customs in vogue at Baden at the end of the sixteenth century.</p>
<p>Although Baden derived a  large revenue from the influx of visitors, which these national meetings  attracted to the spot, the periodical occurrence of such gatherings occasioned  at the same time a degree of luxury and extravagance which the Swiss were  little able to afford, and from which all the neighbouring cantons suffered.  Indeed &lsquo;fashion&rsquo; had become a fever, and was spreading fast; and the people of  Zurich seem to have been especially glad to lay aside for a time the greater  strictness and prudery of manners which had been introduced into Switzerland by  the Reformation, and which consorted little with the habits of a court or of  diplomatic life. As, however, wealth was rather the exception than the rule  with them, they soon found it necessary to devise some means of supplying the  funds requisite to enable them to vie with the brilliant society which gathered  round the foreign ambassadors and those following in their train. They were  therefore in the habit of obtaining from richer friends and relatives presents  of money, provisions, silver goblets, &amp;c. &amp;c., a custom which was  gradually followed by the government itself; and we find later, that when  princes or distinguished persons arrived, they were regularly welcomed with  valuable gifts. This entailed farther hardships; for taxes had to be levied on  all classes to meet the extraordinary expenditure which this practice involved,  and the authorities of Zurich, justly alarmed, at length formally abolished the  custom in 1646. At the same time, a special conference was convoked in order to  prevent the women of Zurich from indulging in too great extravagance of dress  at Baden, and from playing at ninepins in the public places!</p>
<p>In 1670 it was still the  fashion for gentlemen to visit ladies in the bath, and in their presence to  indulge in various gymnastic exercises and amusements, such as leaping over the  basin with drawn swords, wrestling, &amp;c. &amp;c. These exhibitions of course  often led to broils, and it was not uncommon for duels to be fought on the  spot, to the terror and dismay of the fair occupants of the bath.</p>
<p>Baden continued to  maintain its reputation for gaiety and attractiveness until 1712, when the Diet  transferred its settings to Frauenfeld, in the canton of Thurgovie. From this  period luxury and frivolity gradually disappeared, and the reign of exaggerated  simplicity and puritanical stiffness commenced. A temporary and partial  reaction, however, occurred in 1714, when the representatives of the European  Powers held a congress at Baden, subsequently to settling the preliminaries of  the treaty of peace at Rastatt, which terminated the war of the Spanish  succession.</p>
<p>The sun of Baden, which  seemed to have set for ever, shone forth once more with unaccustomed  brilliancy. The town was busy with preparations on an extended scale. Every inn  and private house underwent a thorough transformation. Mirrors, paintings, and  all the valuables which could be collected together were pressed into the  service of the authorities as well as of private individuals to do honour to  the large influx of expected guests. Hundreds of carts streamed into Baden,  loaded with wines, game, and provisions of all kinds. The town being far too  small to contain the crowds assembled to witness the pageant, booths and tents  were erected beyond the gates by enterprising foreigners, which were day and  night the scene of feasting, drinking, and gambling. All the neighbouring baths  and villages were filled to overflowing. The suite of the French ambassador  alone consisted of three hundred persons, including many ladies of high rank  and distinction. The foreign representatives took their part in the general  rejoicing by giving receptions, breakfasts, balls, and garden-parties. But  pleasure was not allowed to absorb every leisure moment. Several conferences  took place, the negotiations being conducted by the Comte de Luc and the Sieur  Barberie de St. Contest on the part of France, and by the Comte de Goes and  Monsieur de Seilern on behalf of Austria; and lastly, when every difficulty had  been smoothed away, Prince Eugene and the Duc de Villars joined the congress.</p>
<p>The treaty was signed and  duly sealed at the &lsquo;Rathhaus&rsquo; of Baden on the 7th of September 1714, in the  presence of all the plenipotentiaries, as well as of a large concourse of  persons. On the conclusion of the ceremony, the spectators disputed with each  other the possession of the pens, sealing-wax, and every article found on the  table where the treaty had been drawn up. A medal was struck at Vienna to  commemorate this important transaction. On one side, Mars is seen sitting on  the shore of the Limmat, washing his blood-stained sword in the waters of the  river, the background being filled in with the town of Baden. The &lsquo;genius loci&rsquo;  is represented floating in the air, holding the arms of the town, which bear  the following inscription:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Has tandem ad Thermas  fessus Mars abluit ensem.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The reverse side is  ornamented with a figure of the Emperor Charles VI., kneeling in a theatrical  attitude. Behind him stands a female form (typical of the Holy Roman Empire) in  front of an altar on which is placed a helmet jetting forth flames. The emperor  is in the act of scattering incense on the fire, in token of thanksgiving. The  emblems of peace are represented by fields and vineyards in the distance, and  below is inscribed:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Exsolvunt grates Caesar  et Imperium.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The meeting of the  congress was the last expiring flash of the gaieties of Baden. The days of its  splendour and display are become things of the past, and the guests who now  people the numerous chambers of the old Stadthof no longer frequent them in  quest of fashionable society and amusement. Still the reputation of the mineral  waters continues as great as ever, and the baths are yearly visited, as we have  already stated, by many thousands of invalids, chiefly French and Swiss, and  are perhaps more highly esteemed than any others in the country.</p>
<p>The sulphurous springs,  nineteen in number, issue from the ground at a temperature of 108&deg; Fahrenheit,  and are considered particularly efficacious in cases of gout and rheumatism.  The town is well provided with good hotels, of which the principal is still the  Stadthof.</p>
<p>Although Baden does not  offer to the eye the grand and striking effects of scenery which we usually  associate with the name of Switzerland, many picturesque spots in the immediate  neighbourhood, including the ruined castle of the House of Hapsburg, on the  rocky heights above the river, provide a sufficient variety of walks and  drives; while the Zurich line of railway, on which it is situated, connects the  ancient watering-place with all the finest parts of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="TheVirginiaSprings"></a>The Virginia Springs</strong></h2>
<p>The &lsquo;Spring Region&rsquo; of  Virginia comprises portions of the States of Virginia and West Virginia. It  includes a large number of mineral springs, of exceedingly varied medical  properties. Of these spas, the Greenbrier White-Sulphur Springs bear off the  palm, and are most resorted to. They are situated on Howard&rsquo;s Creek, in  Greenbrier County, West Virginia, 2000 feet above tide water, and upon the  western slope of the great mountain range which separates the waters that flow  into Chesapeake Bay from those that run into the Gulf of Mexico. The scenery of  this region is highly picturesque. Mountains surround the charming little  valley which contains the renowned white-sulphur spa. Nature has been truly  lavish with her gifts, and was not content with simply endowing this spot with  bad-smelling, but health-giving, waters. Bold mountainous elevations shut in  quiet valleys, where clear sparkling streams ripple over gravelly beds, and  under dense masses of foliage. The summer and fall climate is delightful.  During the summer the thermometer ranges between 55&deg; and 65&deg;, and rarely  attains a greater height than 80&deg; at any hour during the day; while the  atmosphere is elastic and invigorating. Within easy access from the White  Sulphur, north, south, east, and west, are the other mineral springs, all more  or less frequented, of which the &lsquo;Hot,&rsquo; &lsquo;Warm,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Healing&rsquo; Springs, the &lsquo;Sweet&rsquo;  and &lsquo;Sweet Chalybeate,&rsquo; and the &lsquo;Salt&rsquo; and &lsquo;Red Sulphur,&rsquo; are the most  important.</p>
<p>More than fifty years  ago, the White-Sulphur Springs were frequented by invalids, and for the greater  portion of that time this has been the favourite summer resort of the wealth,  talent, and beauty of the Southern States. It is not uncommon to meet at these  springs now persons who have not missed a season &mdash; save during the late war &mdash; for  twenty and even thirty years. In the days of the lumbering stage-coach, the  majority of the visitors came from their distant homes in splendid private  carriages, with their liveried servants and fine horses, and established  themselves in their own cottages. If you were not the fortunate possessor of a  cottage, you found the accommodations of the poorest description. Indeed, you  were fortunate in obtaining even the roughest shelter. There were no  conveniences of any kind. The larder was uncommonly lean. The guests had to  organise forage parties to avert starvation. Haunches of venison were scrambled  for, and eggs and butter intercepted along the public highway. With the cooks  and servants, a system of wholesale bribery and corruption was inaugurated. If  a guest ventured to complain of the meagreness of the hotel fare &mdash; and it is  presumable that many did so venture &mdash; the proprietor would say: &lsquo;I charge you  ten dollars a week for the water. Everything else I give you is <em>free!</em>&rsquo; What more could be said? This  state of affairs continued for many years. Indeed, it is only recently that the  public table has been even passably well supplied, or that ordinary comforts  and conveniences have been provided.</p>
<p>In 1857, the property came  into the possession of a company, composed mainly of residents of Virginia, who  soon after set to work to improve and beautify the grounds, and to erect a main  hotel building, which is the largest structure of the kind in the Southern  country, its dimensions being 400 feet in length by a corresponding width, and  covering nearly an acre of ground. The office, bar, restaurant, barber&rsquo;s-shop,  telegraph and express offices, the kitchen, and a printing-office, are situated  on the ground floor; above which, opening upon a spacious verandah extending  the whole length of the building on each side, are the ball-room, dining-room,  parlour, and reception rooms. The dining-room, 320 feet long, where 2000  persons can dine together, is, doubtless, the largest in the world. The parlour  is one of the most elegant and spacious salons in America, being half as large  again as the celebrated East Room in the President&rsquo;s mansion in Washington. The  ball-room, at the opposite end of the building, is of similar proportions, and  has a floor of hard pine as free from inequalities and almost as highly  polished as the surface of a mirror. The second and third stories of the hotel  are used for sleeping apartments. In front and rear, and at each end of the  main building, are cottages, arranged in rows along the hill-sides, and making  quite a village. A few of these are two-storied dwellings, with colonnade  fronts; but the majority are low sharp-roofed cottages, with verandahs in  front, shaded by trees and clinging vines. The cottages are designated by &lsquo;rows&rsquo;  or &lsquo;streets,&rsquo; such as Broadway, Virginia Row, Baltimore Row, Georgia Row,  Alabama Row, Louisiana Row, Carolina Row, Paradise Row, Bachelor&rsquo;s Row, Wolf  Row, and Gambler&rsquo;s Row, the latter containing the lair of the &lsquo;tiger,&rsquo; where  much money is lost by visitors in learning the mysteries of faro, roulette, and  other games.</p>
<p>Near the bottom of the  valley is the spring, over which a pavilion has been erected. This was  surmounted some years ago by a statue of Hygeia, the Goddess of Health, holding  in her right hand a cup filled with water, and in her left a herb. This statue  disappeared during the war, having been carried away, or destroyed, by  Sheridan&rsquo;s raiders, and has not since been replaced. The great fountain bubbles  up from a stratum of limestone rock, and is received in an octagonal pool,  four-and-a-half feet in diameter, which it fills to a depth of four feet. The  temperature of its waters is 62&deg; Fah., from which they do not vary during the  whole year. The spring yields about thirty gallons a minute, and it is a  remarkable fact that this quantity is not perceptibly varied during the longest  spells of wet or dry weather. The waste water is conveyed through a pipe to the  bath building, which is situated on the creek a couple of hundred yards away,  and completely hidden behind a projecting hill. The White-Sulphur water was  analysed in 1842 by Professor Hayes of Boston. In his report he says:</p>
<p>&lsquo;This water is colourless  and transparent &mdash; when agitated it sparkles from the disengagement of air-bubbles.  Taste hepatic, resembling that of a solution of hydro-sulphuric acid in water.  Exposed to the atmosphere, the hepatic odour is succeeded by a slight earthy  odour. It blackens metals and salts of lead. Compared with pure water, free  from air, its specific gravity is 1.00254. 50,000 grains (about seven pints) of  this water contains, in solution, 3.633 water grain measures of gaseous matter,  or about 1-14 of its volume, consisting of &mdash; Nitrogen gas, 1.013; oxygen gas, .108;  carbonic acid, 2.444; hydro-sulphuric acid, .068. In the same quantity of  water, 115 739-1000 grains of saline matter, consisting of &mdash; Sulphate of lime,  67.168; sulphate of magnesia, 30.364; chloride of magnesium, .859; carbonate of  lime, 6.060; organic matter, 3.740; carbonic acid, 4.584; silicates (silica, 1.34;  potash, .18; soda, .66; magnesia, and a trace of oxyd iron), 2.960. The  medicinal properties of this water are probably due to the action of this  organic substance. The hydro-sulphuric acid resulting from its natural action  is one of the most active substances within the reach of physicians, and there  are chemical reasons for supposing that after the water has reached the stomach  similar changes, accompanied by the product of hydro-sulphuric acid, take  place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The distinctive medical  influences of this water upon the system are cathartic, diuretic, sudorific,  and alterative. Its specialty is its action on the liver, and its cure of the  diseases which are caused by a functional derangement of the liver. Dyspepsia  can be cured at some of these springs; as, indeed, may nearly all the chronic  diseases, with the exception of consumption.</p>
<p>My first visit to the  White-Sulphur Springs was in August 1869. The stage-coach had given way a few  weeks before to the iron horse, the rails of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad  having been laid to the very entrance of the grounds. Leaving Washington at  seven o&rsquo;clock A.M., I embarked on board a ferryboat for half-an-hour&rsquo;s sail  down the broad Potomac, to the sleepy and seedy-looking town of Alexandria.  Here passengers for the springs take a train on the Orange and Alexandria  Railroad to Gordonsville, where connection is made with the Chesapeake and  Ohio. Every mile of the journey is over historic ground. It is only necessary  to mention the names of a few of the stations to call up memories of the bloody  past, where the gray-coated soldiers of the Southern Confederacy and those in  the Federal blue swarmed on the hill-sides, and swept like tornadoes over the  plains. In those days the dense battle-smoke obscured the now peaceful heavens;  and in fields where the grain is ripening, the great reaper, Death, gathered in  his fearful harvest. No traces of the late conflict now remain, save a Federal  burial-ground at one point, and here and there the ruins of an earthwork. But  the names alone of Manasses Junction, Warrenton Junction, Culpepper  Court-house, Rapidan, Orange Court-house, Gordonsville, and Charlottesville are  sufficient to excite the interest of the traveller, and to cause him to  scrutinise the landscape closely. For the first half of the journey, however,  there is little in the scenery to elicit admiration. When the spurs of the Blue  Ridge are reached, the views are full of attraction for the lover of nature. At  times the train seems to cling to the mountain side, and you look down, many  hundred feet, upon the beautiful and fertile valley of Virginia, with its snug  farm-houses, meandering streams, clumps of trees, and broad fields of grain,  corn, and tobacco. One scene has been particularly admired by all who have seen  it. Two lofty hills, densely wooded from foot to summit, rise abruptly from the  banks of a stream of crystal clearness, which flows placidly along under  overhanging foliage. Clinging to the side of one of these hills, and just above  the stream, is a picturesque-looking dwelling. The stream loses itself in the  shadows and foliage between the mountains, while a background of hills, whose  soft outlines melt into the blue distance, complete a picture worthy of being  transferred to canvas by a master-hand. Later, the scenery becomes bolder, more  grand, and of exceeding wildness. On my first visit, however, the train was  delayed by a &lsquo;land-slide,&rsquo; so that we did not climb the Alleghanies until  after night-fall. I can only recall the tilting of the car endways and sideways  &mdash; in my sleepy condition it seemed sometimes to assume an angle of 45&deg; &mdash; the  wild snorts and shrieks of the three locomotives, which puffed and panted like  living creatures, and at times seemed powerless to push or draw their burden;  and then the welcome rattle of the brakes, and the mysterious movements of  lanterns in the darkness without, as the train halted at the present terminus  of the road, and the journey was ended.</p>
<p>Having since passed over  the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad in the daytime, I am able to substantiate the  wonderful stories told, not only of the grandeur of the scenery, but of the  engineering skill displayed in the construction of the line. The following statistics,  furnished by a civil engineer, will no doubt prove more comprehensible than &lsquo;Alps  upon Alps&rsquo; of adjectives. The road from the White-Sulphur Springs to Covington  &mdash; a distance of 22 miles &mdash; is of the most substantial character, and probably  cost more per mile than any section of road in the United States. Cuts and  fills of from 50 to 80 feet are frequent; and there are some of 100 feet, one  of 140 feet, and one of 180 feet. The largest &lsquo;fill&rsquo; is the Moss Run fill, the  embankment containing 800,000 feet of earthwork, sufficient to make forty miles  of railroad in Eastern Virginia, or through any ordinary country. The  embankment is but one quarter of a mile long, and cost $400,000. Jerry&rsquo;s Run  embankment is 179 feet high, and one quarter of a mile long. It will cost when  completed $700,000. The trains now pass over a temporary bridge at this point.  The average cost of the road per mile between the White-Sulphur Springs and  Covington is $160,000, some miles costing as much as $300,000. A temporary track  one-and-a-half miles long was in use at Mud or Red Hill tunnel in 1869. It was  afterwards abandoned, the main track having been completed, and the trains now  run through the tunnel. A large force has been recently employed on the  straight track at Millboro. The temporary track is very substantial; but the  grade is so steep that two powerful engines must be used to draw a train up.  The temporary track at Jerry&rsquo;s Run is two and a half miles long. It winds along  the side of a steep hill, and at times, as you look down upon the wild and  rugged valley below, you feel as if you were being transported through the  realms of another sphere, and that you are gazing upon a picture which forms no  part of the world you are, for the time, inhabiting. The trestle-work over  which the trains pass is 1400 feet long. Although of the most substantial  character, and as safe as possible, as it is just wide enough for the track,  and as you see no sign of it beneath you, you have all the experience of a sail  through mid-air, except the absence of that gentle and perfect motion which no  worker in metals since the days of Tubal Cain has ever been able to rival.</p>
<p>A long breath after that  flight, good reader!</p>
<p>The maximum grade on the  temporary track, going west, is 290 feet, and going east, 195 feet. The maximum  and ruling grade on the main track going west is 60 feet to the mile, and going  east but 30 feet to the mile. There are no curves on the main track of less  than 1000 feet radius; and on the temporary track the shortest radius of any  curve is 477 feet. There are eight tunnels, of which the following may be  mentioned: Johnson&rsquo;s tunnel, 200 feet long, single track; Red Hill or Mud  tunnel, 640 feet long; Morris&rsquo; tunnel, 400 feet long; Lake&rsquo;s tunnel, 800 feet  long; Kelly&rsquo;s tunnel, 600 feet long; Lewis&rsquo;s tunnel, 3,900 feet long; and  Alleghany tunnel, 4,760 feet long. All of these latter have a double track; and  the total length of the tunnels is two and one-eighth miles. When it is added  that the entire road-bed is of the most substantial character, and that the  equipment of the line is all that could be desired for comfort, speed, and  safety, it must be admitted that the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad is a triumph  of engineering skill of which the United States may reasonably boast.</p>
<p>The only really dangerous  place on the road is said to be at Covington, where the eastward-bound  traveller is tempted into leaving the train by promises of an excellent  breakfast, but where, if he succeeds in getting anything to eat, of any  description, he is likely to pay a penalty for partaking in the pains of  dyspepsia. The hard-boiled eggs, cold chicken, apple-pie, and lemonade of Sambo  at Charlottesville or Dinah at Gordonsville are, however, quite palatable and  of reasonable price. You may make your purchases from the car-window, and eat  at your leisure, and thus avoid the extortion and imposition of railway  eating-houses.</p>
<p>But to return to the  railroad. This grand work, now barely half completed, is destined for greater  things than the mere carrying of pleasure-seekers to and from the White Sulphur  and adjacent springs. As its name would indicate, it is designed to connect the  waters of the Ohio with those of the Chesapeake; to become another great  highway for trade and travel between the Atlantic seaboard and the fertile and  rapidly growing West. Northern capitalists have embarked in the enterprise, and  within two years a single track will be completed to the banks of the Ohio.  Then the tide of travel will set in from the westward towards the Virginian  Springs, and they will have thousands of visitors where now there are hundreds.</p>
<p>Arriving at the  White-Sulphur Springs during the first week in August 1869, I found &lsquo;the season&rsquo;  at its height. Some two thousand people had registered, and were content with  accommodation for perhaps twelve hundred. Many of my fellow-passengers were  aghast at the prospect. It was approaching daybreak, and we had stood for  half-an-hour or more in the office after inserting our names in the visitors&rsquo;  book, and exerting all our powers of diplomacy on the room-clerk, with a view  to obtaining some advantage over each other. Finally, one detachment was  marched off, under convoy of a coloured man with a lantern, to a small church  within the grounds, the basement of which had been strewn with mattresses. Five  men (including myself) who had never met before were consigned to a portion of  the main hall in the third story of the hotel; where, by means of sheets  suspended from a rope, a good-sized sleeping apartment had been improvised.  There were two narrow cots and three mattresses upon the floor, and of these we  took possession. Having an oil-lamp behind the screen, our figures were  distinctly outlined upon it, which caused some meiriment as people passed our  camp en route to their rooms. But this only led to laughter from us in return,  and then nothing more would be heard from the outside but the pit-pat of little  feet scampering down the long passages. For the most part good-humour, and a  disposition to make the best of everything, prevailed. There were some  grumblers, as a matter of course; but they were in the minority. If they were  dissatisfied, they could go away &mdash; there were plenty of newcomers to take their  places. During the rush of visitors, men, women, and children slept upon the  parlour-floor; and ladies, utter strangers to each other, were stowed away five  and six in a small room, with two in a bed, and some on mattresses placed on  the bare floor. Husbands were separated from their wives, and many ludicrous  scenes and incidents resulted from the confusion consequent upon the daily  arrival of two or three hundred people late at night. One evening a young lady,  having left the ball-room for the purpose of retiring, ran shrieking through  the hall in the third story of the hotel, and meeting some of her friends,  declared that there was a man in her room. It proved, however, that she had  opened the wrong door. On another occasion a man, who had evidently been  drinking something stronger than sulphur water, insisted that a room in which a  lady was disrobing belonged to a friend of his, and that he was entitled to  half the bed; and but for the prompt appearance on the scene of an  ex-Confederate general, who occupied a room adjoining, would have caused  serious annoyance. Mr. Jones was frequently aroused from his slumbers by  persons looking for Smith; and what with the slamming of doors, the rattling of  locks, the dragging of luggage through the halls, the squeaking of boots, and  the vociferous shouts for servants, the hotel was for some days a perfect  bedlam or pandemonium. Yet people would flock here, and endure the discomfort  until they had at least an opportunity to display their wardrobes, when they  would flit to other springs, less crowded and less fashionable. One night when  the train was, as usual, behind time, a lady assigned to a room near mine (I  had then secured a distinct apartment in one of the cottages) made the night  hideous with her fault-findings. She &lsquo;never saw such a pig-pen!&rsquo; She wanted to  &lsquo;leave at once.&rsquo; She &lsquo;would not stay a minute.&rsquo; &lsquo;No, she wouldn&rsquo;t take her  bonnet off.&rsquo; She &lsquo;wouldn&rsquo;t lay down.&rsquo; &lsquo;Are there no better rooms?&rsquo; &lsquo;Is No. 1999  (mine) any better?&rsquo; Finally, on being told she could not get away before  morning, she sent her unfortunate husband to the proprietors on what I knew  would prove a fruitless errand; and I went to sleep.</p>
<p>There are many  attractions to draw visitors to these springs. The scenery is beautiful. It is  a pleasure to breathe the pure mountain air. One meets here charming society,  &amp;c. A clergyman whom the proprietors had engaged to conduct divine service  during a former season startled his hearers by asking in his inaugural sermon,  &lsquo;What do the old ladies bring their daughters here for? Is it to marry them to  the men whom they love? No,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;it is to marry them to men with money  &mdash; to sell them, in fact.&rsquo; And then he went on to say something even more  obnoxious, and in very questionable taste, which I will not repeat. The future  services of this most over-refined divine were of course dispensed with, the  proprietors not caring to have farther insults heaped upon their guests. Nor  were these allegations true. There is very little done in the way of  match-making at these summer resorts. People come and go; and in the rush and  confusion there are few opportunities for serious courtship. Possibly some  young ladies may &lsquo;set their caps&rsquo; here as elsewhere; and young men, and old,  may also seek for life-partners, as well as for the German or croquet &mdash; and why  shouldn&rsquo;t they?</p>
<p>One word tells what  people do here; and that is &mdash; <em>dance</em>.  Some few occupations incidental to dancing may, however, be mentioned. We will  suppose that Beauty is out of her bed at 8 o&rsquo;clock A.M. She first visits the  spring; and it is a pleasant sight to see the young ladies congregate there before  breakfast in the studied neglige of their morning toilets. The walk and the  pure air bring a rosy glow upon fair cheeks, and soft eyes sparkle with health  and happiness. Some sip the water as daintily as a humming-bird extracts honey  from a flower; a few make a wry face, as though swallowing unpalatable  medicine; while others quaff the clear sparkling liquid as though they enjoyed  it. Indeed, one does come to like the water after a time, and to drink three or  four glasses of it before breakfast with a decided relish.</p>
<p>Take a newspaper, seat  yourself upon a bench, and the beauty of the springs will pass in review before  you. How daintily the young women trip down the hill to the fountain, their  skirts looped up to avoid the dew! They have fleecy shawls or bright scarfs or  opera cloaks thrown over their shoulders to protect them from the morning air;  while some who are returning from a stroll in the surrounding woods have bright  autumn leaves twined in their hair, or pinned on their bosoms. Others who present  (must I say it?) a rather limp and draggled appearance are just from the bath.  Peering over your newspaper you see all this, and much more besides, while the  cheerful twitter of the maidens&rsquo; voices, and their birdlike trills of laughter,  fall pleasantly upon the ear.</p>
<p>Near you sits ex-Governor  Henry A. Wise, fashioning a walking-stick he has cut during his morning walk,  and giving utterance to his views on the political situation in fiery words, to  which a little group of bystanders listen attentively. Among his utterances on  one occasion were some sentences like these: &lsquo;I would not give a pinch of snuff  for the writ of habeas corpus in this country.&rsquo; &lsquo;We ought to stand on  principle, and the crawling creeping creatures of expediency and policy ought  to be kicked out of the temple of liberty.&rsquo; &lsquo;We are drifting into imperialism,  and if I had health and strength, I would thunder it from the housetops into  the ears of the people.&rsquo; But he does not yet &lsquo;despair of the republic&rsquo; &mdash; &lsquo;or,&rsquo;  said he, &lsquo;I should be an infidel if I did not believe in the ultimate triumph  of the right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Hard by stands Commodore  Matthew F. Maury, grasping a stout walking-stick in his right hand, and  discussing the condition of affairs in Virginia &mdash; and particularly the  water-line communication with the West &mdash; with a party of friends. The Commodore  has grown a white stubbly beard of late; but still looks fresh and vigorous,  and destined to many years of usefulness.</p>
<p>Now comes General Robert  E. Lee, dressed in a modest suit of gray, and wearing a broad-brimmed straw  hat, from under which you catch the kindly half-melancholy expression of his  handsome eyes. Set in its frame of gray beard, his is a countenance to love and  admire. With General Lee is W. W. Corcoran, Esq., the princely Washington banker,  whose benevolent face is a correct index to his character. All these gentlemen  I met, as described, at the spring one morning. Elsewhere I shall refer to  other distinguished guests, taking up now the thread of daily life at the  &lsquo;White.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After breakfast Beauty  resorts to the spacious parlour, where the belles and beaux congregate to &lsquo;do  treadmill,&rsquo; as they describe their promenade round and round the room. The  mammas, papas, and chaperones sit against the walls, with perhaps here and  there a young couple enjoying a quiet chat or mild flirtation. After an hour or  more has elapsed, the ten-pin alley or photograph saloon is visited; or the  romantic walks about &lsquo;Lovers&rsquo; Leap&rsquo; explored.</p>
<p>Then the spring is again  resorted to: and toilets are made for dinner. After dinner, &lsquo;treadmill&rsquo; again &mdash;  later, a siesta, a drive or ride, or a lounge under the spreading shady trees  on the lawn, where the band plays for an hour or more before tea. Now the great  event of the day draws near, and Beauty appears at the tea-table in full-dress.  A little &lsquo;treadmill&rsquo; is gone through after tea, so that engagements may be made  for the evening; and then to the ballroom, with its slippery floor and lively  music. The German is danced every evening; and sometimes, by way of variety, it  is danced in the morning as well. Indeed, I am not sure that some of the young  ladies do not begrudge the use of the ballroom for other purposes on one day  out of the seven. Wednesday evening there is dress-ball. On the other evenings  about one-half of the ladies present appear in full-dress; the remainder are  variously attired, and as many wear short dresses, they make rather liberal  display of their ankles in the round dances. Of course the young ladies in long  skirts and the old ladies who sit in the background think it is horrid of the  short-skirted ones to make such a display. Some of the gentlemen are really <em>outr&eacute;</em>, wearing coloured shirts and  morning suits; but quite one half have sufficient respect for themselves and  the company to put on white shirts and black coats. A few appear in dress suits;  which is, after all, the correct thing when a gentleman goes among ladies in  the evening, whether to opera, concert, or ball. Dancing is over by midnight;  and so ends the day. The same routine is followed on the morrow, and until the  end of the season.</p>
<p>Of course, at a place  like this, there must be petty jealousies and heart-burnings. There are sure to  be found people who delight in saying ill-natured things; people who make witty  remarks at the expense of their friends, as well as of strangers; people who  have keen eyes for cotton, velvet, and lace, and are skilful in detecting  French gilt and paste; and others with a wonderful memory for last year&rsquo;s  dresses. We could not well do without these people either. They are the vinegar  and pepper which help to make up the salad of society. They give piquancy to  the insipidity engendered by excessive goodness, and by creating laughter rouse  the misanthropical from their torpor. I do not think there is any reason in  these feminine amenities; for, of course, the people I have referred to belong,  almost without exception, to the gentler sex. I jotted down a few of the  remarks made to me, or in my hearing, though I fear they lose much in the  transfer from rosy lips to ink and paper. The morning after a ball a young lady  was pointed out to me who wore a pair of blue boots (evidently too small for  comfort) with this remark: &lsquo;That girl must have slept in those boots. She wore  them last night, and they were so very tight, she couldn&rsquo;t get them off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The following remarks are  from various sources:</p>
<p>&lsquo;That girl is wearing the  same head-dress she wore last year; and the same flowers, arranged in the same  way. Don&rsquo;t believe she has combed her hair since.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a lady who had  one hundred and one offers, and took the one hundred and oneth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a California  widow, who has had seven husbands; three are dead, and four living. The last  she was divorced from.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That lady has the  reputation of never wearing the same dress twice; but I saw her in a dress she  wore here last season.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the girls here mean  business, i.e. matrimony.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That lady never wears a  dress a second time. Her husband&rsquo;s income last year was $60,000.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That young lady is from  Baltimore. She sits on the grass under the trees and a brown umbrella all day  long. Of course she does not sit alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Green has nineteen  suits of clothes.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is a Tennessee  colonel. He is a great ladies&rsquo; man, and has the reputation of killing a young  lady in a fifteen minutes&rsquo; interview.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a young man  with a senseless face and several upper stories to let. But he has a fine pair  of horses, and the prettiest girls here smile upon him, and accept his  invitations to dine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Blacque Bey is the great  gun here. Everybody does what B. B. does. When B. B. sneezes, everybody  sneezes. When B. B. walks, everybody walks. What B. B. says, everybody swears  to. It&rsquo;s a big thing to be B. B.&rsquo; &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>In recalling the names  and faces of those I met at the White Sulphur in 1869, I am painfully reminded  that the two most distinguished are dead. General Robert E. Lee, the great  soldier and Christian gentleman, has been summoned to brighter realms above;  and George Peabody, the millionaire philanthropist, who gave away his millions  while living, has gone to his rest after a life of unwearied well-doing. He was  in feeble health while at the springs, and rarely left his cottage. On one  occasion only he appeared in the parlour, and the ovation he then received was  touching. Ladies thronged about him, eager to press his hand; and some even  claimed the privilege of bestowing sweet kisses on one whom they regarded as a  national benefactor. During his sojourn at the White Sulphur, Mr. Peabody gave  $60,000 to the College at Lexington, Virginia, of which General Lee was  President. Mr. Peabody&rsquo;s first donation in behalf of Southern education, made  in 1866, was $1,000,000 in cash and $1,000,000 in Mississippi State bonds. The  second donation, made in 1869, was $1,000,000 in cash and $486,000 in Florida  State bonds. The nominal amount, therefore, is $3,500,000, though only  $2,000,000 are at present available. This is judiciously invested, and yields  annually about $130,000. In special recognition of the former of these  donations, the Congress of the United States, on the 16th of March 1867, voted  to Mr. Peabody a magnificent gold medal, which was soon after made and  presented to him. The testimonial, though called a medal, is more properly a  piece of symbolic statuary, about one foot in height &mdash; an exquisite work of  art. It was manufactured in New York, and cost $7000.</p>
<p>The Southern Confederacy  was largely represented at the White Sulphur. General Lee was, of course, the  great attraction. General Beauregard, too, ranked as a fixed star, and was  specially noticeable for his gallant attentions to the fair sex. Then there  were Generals Magruder, Lawton, H. A. Wise, Gary, and others, and Colonel  Moseby. Commander Maury had his satellites; and there were hosts of senators,  ex-ministers, and ex-governors, colonels and captains by the score, and no end  of ex-railroad presidents, with a sprinkling of judges, and a small dose of  doctors. Baltimoreans were very numerous, and took the lead in everything.  Perhaps I am prejudiced; but kinder people I never met than those who dwell in  the Monumental City. Foremost in all charitable movements, and devoted to the  South and its interests, they carry into private life the kindly feeling toward  strangers, the generous hospitality, and graceful courtesies of the old school.  No ladies receive more attention at the springs than the Baltimoreans &mdash; few as  much. The men from the far South are wonderfully attracted by these Baltimore  belles; and I fear often play truant to the girls they left behind them.</p>
<p>Dr. Burke, from whose  work on the Virginia Springs, published thirty years ago, I quote, thus  describes the social aspect of these springs, in contrast with similar resorts  in the North:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Saratoga and other  Northern watering-places being brought by railroads into contiguity with large  and populous cities and towns, and accessible to persons in every condition of  life at a trifling expense, the mass of visitors is, of course, composed of all  sorts of people. The knowledge of this fact makes men distrustful of each  other&rsquo;s standing, and shy and reserved. Such a material wants, and ever will  want, the enchanting ease of manner, dignity of deportment, and air of true  gentility which distinguishes Nature&rsquo;s gentlemen from the mere cockneys and  pretenders. At the Virginia Springs, on the contrary, there is a feeling of  equality, a relinquishment of formality, a republican simplicity of manners, a  reciprocity of kind, courteous, but unpretending civility, that renders these  places peculiarly agreeable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If such was the contrast  in the olden times, how much more salient is it now, when &lsquo;shoddy and  petroleum&rsquo; have overwhelmed the Northern watering-places! Among the visitors at  the White Sulphur last season were the children of many of those who were once  known here in their own cottages almost as lords of the manor; and there were,  too, some of the old habitu&eacute;s, although they live now in a style rather simpler  than that of former days. As an evidence of the prevailing simplicity of  manners, there is nothing so striking as the little groups of persons, ladies  and gentlemen, who come down on the green lawn, under the big oak-trees, and,  spreading out a blanket or shawl, squat down on it <em>&agrave; la</em> tailor, or recline <em>&agrave; la</em> Turk, and chatter like very children. Nobody talks loudly, nobody puts on &lsquo;airs,&rsquo;  nobody cuts a swell. There is an observable general aspect of ease, dignity,  and genuine good-breeding well becoming a place which is the representative of  Southern refinement.</p>
<p>Two or three grand balls  are given each season by the proprietors, who also provide music for dancing  six nights in every week. Particularly brilliant was the grand fancy-dress  affair, known as the Peabody Ball, which took place on the 11th of August 1869.  It was attended by more than two thousand persons, including the wall-flowers. Few  masks were worn, but a very large number of the dancers were in fancy dress,  and the costumes generally were the most costly and elegant ever seen at a  Southern watering-place. Many of the dresses were fashioned by Parisian <em>modistes</em>, having been ordered and  imported specially for this occasion. The display of jewels, especially of  diamonds, and the rich laces, reminded one of <em>ante-bellum</em> festivities. It is a remarkable fact that there was no  &lsquo;Belle of the Ball.&rsquo; From so many beautiful, charming, and attractive women it  was impossible to select one who conspicuously outshone her companions.</p>
<p>Every one wants to carry  away from the springs some memento of his or her visit. The photographer finds  constant and profitable employment in taking groups at the spring or before the  cottages. The gentlemen purchase walking-sticks from the natives, or cut them  in the vicinity of Lovers&rsquo; Leap; and both ladies and gentlemen resort to the  Japanese store, where only articles of Japanese manufacture are sold, and where  you can purchase a great many curious things, provided your purse is well  lined. The ladies carry fans, on which are inscribed the autographs of their  admirers and the celebrities. The signatures of Generals Lee and Beauregard are  often met with, and are greatly prized. Of course, such an everyday occurrence  as the carrying away of manly hearts by departing belles calls for no special  mention. Yet this is a serious matter, if we may believe in the protestations  and lamentations of the melancholy youths one finds smoking their cigars under  the gallery in the morning, instead of doing &lsquo;treadmill&rsquo; as usual. But many, I  fear, &lsquo;take heart again&rsquo; on the arrival of some new beauty.</p>
<p>The season of 1870 at the  White-Sulphur Springs is nearly over. The feminine fashionables, with their  fanciful frippery, fled long since. They had displayed all their new dresses;  exerted all their powers of pleasing; exhausted themselves with over-much  dancing; and, perhaps, exhausted their finances also. A distinguished  Virginian, on being asked how long he expected to remain at the springs,  replied:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, sir, you might just  as well ask me how much money I&rsquo;ve got. A Southern gentleman always stays at  the springs, sir, as long as his money lasts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I write in the mellow  month of October. The trees are clad in their gorgeous autumnal foliage; the  air is clear and bracing; and the warm sunshine glints on the dead-gold,  blood-red, crimson, russet-brown, and pale yellow of the leaves which still  cling, despite autumnal gales, to the trees of the surrounding woods. Then the  blue autumnal haze, which falls over the distant hills, like a veil over a  woman&rsquo;s face, hiding possible defects without placing actual beauties in  eclipse; the morning mists, which stoop low below the mountain crests; the  weird moonlight, the twinkling lights from the cottages, and the brilliant  blaze from the many-windowed hotel, &mdash; all aid to produce effects stranger and  more beautiful than those of theatrical transformation scenes, with their  undressed beauties, blue lights, and tinsel. </p>

<p>In the month of September  1849, the English barque Hermione, 900 tons, was on her passage from London to  the Cape, with a cargo of goods for that colony. She also carried out some 80  or 100 intending colonists, of whom about 15 or 20 were first-class passengers.<strong></strong></p>
<p>These last &mdash; drawn  together by that freemasonry which only exists on board ship during along and  tedious sea-voyage, where the voyagers throw aside all distinctions of clique,  and are dependent upon one another for mutual amusement &mdash; had formed themselves  into a comfortable party, and were gathered together on the quarter-deck one  very fine and sultry evening. The Hermione had accomplished two-thirds of her  passage, and was in the latitudes of flying-fish, bonitas, dolphins, sharks,  and other tropical inhabitants of the deep, the observation of which was a  source of perpetual amusement to the ship&rsquo;s company and passengers.</p>
<p>Amongst the latter were  an old Dutch merchant named Van Leyt, his wife (a lady of German extraction),  and their three daughters, Lenchen, Gretchen, and L&ouml;ttchen. There were a couple  of young gentlemen or so going out as mercantile clerks, a midshipman going to  join his ship, one or two speculators in colonial produce, and a widow lady of  middle age who atfected juvenile airs, and was always talking of her nerves.  Mrs. Chudlepip thought it highly interesting, on any little emergency, to  pretend to be utterly confused and helpless, and to be unable to act without  male assistance. Thus she was perpetually talking of what she said and did on  such and such an occasion, and what she <em>ought</em> to have said and done; videlicet, as she parades the deck on this September  evening, leaning on the arm of a Cape Town &lsquo;colonial broker&rsquo; of considerable  means, and some few years her junior: &lsquo;Well, my dear Mr. Trappit, you see it  was so awkward; the captain asked me if I should like to see some of the crew  dance; and detesting the tedious monotony of this horrid ship, of course I said  yes &mdash; so thoughtless of me, but I am so impulsive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trappit murmured a  few words, intended to be complimentary. The widow continued:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, as you say, dear  Mr. Trappit, my spirits do sometimes get too much for me. Well, when I was informed  that the men would dance <em>with their feet  bare</em> (so improper and indelicate before ladies!), of course I was shocked,  so I immediately withdrew my consent: and what <em>do</em> you think the captain did, Mr. Trappit?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trappit could not  possibly guess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, he actually laughed  at me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trappit coughed;  perhaps it was to avoid following the captain&rsquo;s example.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So you see,&rsquo; added Mrs.  Chudlepip, &lsquo;my impulsive nature led me to do precisely the reverse of what I  ought to have done. Instead of giving my consent thoughtlessly to the gambols  of the crew (which the captain declares are necessary to keep them in spirits),  I ought to have inquired of what nature they would be before sanctioning them  with my presence.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Trappit gazed  vacantly at the sea; the widow inclined her head to one side, and gently played  with her gloved fingers on the ivory handle of her parasol the sweet melody of  &lsquo;What she said and did, and what she <em>ought</em> to have said and done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Nearly all the  first-class passengers were assembled on the aft or quarter-deck, and owing to  the heat, were in various states and degrees of languor. One or two listlessly  promenaded the deck, making abrupt turns, something after the fashion of the  Polar bear in the Regent&rsquo;s park when he feels the heat too much for him. But  the majority reclined upon cushions, sipping lemonade and sherry, and smoking  cigarettes. Mynheer van Leyt and his buxom broad-shouldered wife were engaged  in a game of draughts, whilst their three daughters reclined at their feet,  engaged in their everlasting knitting; which absorbing employment, however, did  not prevent the plump and flaxen-haired L&ouml;ttchen from occasionally casting  side-glances at the young midshipman, who was leaning over the taffrail, idly  throwing date-stones into the water. He was a very handsome fellow was Ernest  Sellars, midshipman of her Majesty&rsquo;s war-sloop Thunderer. He was about twenty  to twenty-two, lithe, active, and sun-browned, with the whitest teeth and the  blackest of curly black hair, and with that general Byronic air which is so  fascinating to a certain class of young lady. Besides, there is no doubt whatever,  that a midshipman&rsquo;s uniform is above most other costumes calculated to set off  to advantage the &lsquo;human form divine.&rsquo; So, unquestionably, thought L&ouml;ttchen van  Leyt; and for the matter of that, it is possible that her sisters were of the  same opinion.</p>
<p>A general air of ennui  pervaded the party: Vrow van Leyt grumbled audibly as she wiped her broad red  face with a large yellow silk handkerchief, and Mrs. Chudlepip seemed to be  meditating on what it would be correct to &lsquo;say and do.&rsquo; Even the &oelig;illades of  the siren L&ouml;ttchen failed to have any effect upon the insensible Sellars, who  continued to puff his cigarette and to throw date-stones into the water with  the utmost nonchalance. Suddenly, however, he started from his listlessness,  exclaiming vehemently,</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, by Jove, what a  monster!&rsquo; The fair Lottchen gave a fascinating little scream as she inquired:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Dear me! what do you  mean, Mr. Sellars? what is so monstrous?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shark, fra&uuml;lein; an  enormous shark that is following us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shark!&rsquo; cried every  one simultaneously, as a general rush was made to the taffrail. Vrow van Leyt  upset the draught-board in the excitement, and Mrs. Chudlepip exclaimed:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Following us! O, how  horrible!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Amid the general  excitement, the captain, who had been engaged in some duty in the forepart of  the vessel, came aft.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What is it, ladies and  gentlemen?&rsquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shark, sir!&rsquo; cried  several of the men.</p>
<p>Captain Torr looked over  the side of the vessel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A shark indeed,&rsquo; said  he, &lsquo;and a monstrous one!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, there was the  savage-looking fish, with his pointed snout and his cruel malevolent-looking  little deep-set eyes, with a sort of satanic gleam in them, as of an evil  spirit anticipating his prey. He was at least thirty-five feet in length; and  as his great black fin cut the water, appearing about a foot above the surface,  there was a stealthy appearance in his movements which caused the passengers to  shudder, as one turns cold with loathing at the sight of a venomous reptile.  The sea was calm as plate-glass, and of a deep intense blue. It was moreover,  as is often the case in these latitudes,phosphorescent; so that as the huge  fish cleft the water with his gigantic fin, he left behind him a track of what  seemed like living fire.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chudlepip suggested  poetically, that the shark looked &lsquo;like a lost spirit amid the flames of  torment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Would you like to look  at him a little closer, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; asked Captain Torr, with a covert smile.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I! O <em>no</em>, thank you, sir!&rsquo; cried the widow,  with an affectation of intense horror.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will you give us leave  to try and catch him, sir?&rsquo; eagerly asked Ernest Sellars, who had seen this  sort of fun before.</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is just what I  meant,&rsquo; returned the captain.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a line of  great strength, with an enormous hook baited with a dead fowl, was speedily  prepared, and the tempting morsel offered to the hungry fish. But although he  kept steadily in the wake of the vessel, and occasionally glared malignantly at  the bait, he would not touch it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s a-waitin&rsquo; for  somethin&rsquo; <em>better</em>, yer honour,&rsquo; said  Pat O&rsquo;Donovan, one of the crew, touching his cap to the captain.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What does he say,  capitaine?&rsquo; inquired Gretchen van Leyt.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, nothing, fra&uuml;lein.  Sailors have such odd superstitions; they think the shark is waiting for one of <em>us</em>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shure an&rsquo; that&rsquo;s it, yer  honour,&rsquo; said Pat, who was endeavouring in vain to entice the monstrous brute.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gott in himmel!&rsquo;  ejaculated the Vrow van Leyt, her red face turning to a hue a little less like  a pickled cabbage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, shocking! dear, dear,  how dreadful!&rsquo; added Mrs. Chudlepip. &lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;<em>Do!</em>&rsquo; returned Captain Torr; &lsquo;why &mdash; nothing. Have a little patience,  ladies, and you&rsquo;ll see the brute lagged yet. Try a bit of salt pork, Pat. Here,  Ned Wilson, ask the cook for a piece of pork.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The whole of the  passengers, fore as well as aft, and the entire crew, were now watching  operations with the greatest interest. The pork was fetched and tried, but was  no more successful than the fowl had been. The shark smelt at it with a  saturnine grin, but would not attempt to swallow it. The sailors began to  mutter to one another, and to shake their heads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Shure it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cute the  baste is!&rsquo; said Pat. &lsquo;Arrah, thin, he knows one of us is goin&rsquo; to kick the  bucket, mates.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, ay,&rsquo; responded  several of his comrades. For it is well known that sharks are extremely  sagacious in this respect, and when death and disease are busy on board a  vessel, they will follow in her wake for days, in greedy expectation of the  dreadful banquet which they know will be forthcoming.</p>
<p>Ernest Sellars, who had  never removed his eyes from the surface of the sea, now descried a second black  fin above the water, about a dozen yards behind the first.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By Jupiter, there&rsquo;s a  pair of them!&rsquo; he cried, pointing out the new-comer to the first mate of the  vessel.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I think it&rsquo;s likely  enough there are a shoal of them,&rsquo; returned the first mate quietly. &lsquo;The  beggars are so artful, they seldom show all at once.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Captain Torr was now  determined to do his utmost to secure one of the monsters; and he was seconded  with a will by his crew, for all sailors hate the shark with an intense spite  and aversion.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fetch a fresh leg of  mutton, Ned,&rsquo; cried the captain. &lsquo;There was a sheep killed an hour ago, and  we&rsquo;ll sacrifice a leg to entice one of those rascals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The leg of mutton was  brought, and whether it was that it savoured more of blood than the salt meat  or the blanched fowl, or whether it reminded the shark of a morsel of a man, it  is impossible to say; but the bait was no sooner offered to the ferocious  creature than he took it with a force which shook the mast to which the end of  the line had been made fast.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Gott bewahr!&rsquo; screamed  the Dutch-German family. &lsquo; &rsquo;Tis like Beelzebub himself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The sailors gradually  hauled in the line, the enraged shark darting from side to side, lashing the  sea with his tail, and scattering showers of brine in clouds over the deck.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chudlepip, with a  succession of little shrieks, seized hold of L&ouml;ttchen van Leyt by the arm, and  poured into that terrified young lady&rsquo;s ear a long string of suggestions as to  what &lsquo;ought to be done,&rsquo; not a word of which could the foreigner understand.</p>
<p>&lsquo;By your leave! stand  away! Out of the way, there!&rsquo; roared half a dozen hoarse excited voices, as the  shark, struggling and vicious, was drawn on to the deck.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good God! get out of the  way, ladies!&rsquo; screamed Captain Torr at the pitch of his voice.</p>
<p>But it was too late. Mrs.  Chudlepip, now in an agony of genuine terror, was too bewildered to know &lsquo;what  to say or do,&rsquo; and in her confusion drew her companion, together with herself,  immediately in the direction of the shark. The angry and alarmed brute gave three  or four resounding slaps with his tail, and away flew Mrs. Chudlepip and L&ouml;ttchen  into the sea.</p>
<p>The confusion was  terrible; ropes were thrown out, a boat was lowered, and Ernest Sellars, with  the impulse of generous youth, jumped overboard without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.</p>
<p>But now a low groan burst  from those on deck, as the second shark was seen to make in the direction of  the unfortunate women. Poor Mrs. Chudlepip&rsquo;s enormous bustle and voluminous  petticoats served as a buoy, and kept the half-drowned pair above water.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now!&rsquo; roared the  captain. &lsquo;Pull, Tom Roberts! another stroke, you have them! Give way, lads,  give way! Hurrah!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And a great cheer arose,  as it was then seen that L&ouml;ttchen van Leyt was safely drawn into the boat.</p>
<p>At the same moment Ernest  Sellars, who was swimming with a rope round his waist towards Mrs. Chudlepip,  seized the halfdead widow by the hair, and gave the signal to be drawn on  board. It was only just in time; for even as the young man and his fat and fair  burden began to rise from the water, the shark turned on his side to seize  them. Making a desperate effort, the unwieldly animal in his disappointment  grabbed furiously at the luckless Mrs. Chudlepip. Away came bustle and  petticoats, torn like old rags; which, being immediately bolted by the shark,  the unfortunate lady was dragged hastily on board with her deliverer, unhurt,  but in a state, as regards wardrobe, which, as the reporters say, &lsquo;may be  better imagined than described.&rsquo; Great as had been the peril, it was impossible  for the passengers to avoid roars of laughter at the widow&rsquo;s forlorn  appearance. Even her wig had come off when grasped by Sellars; and it was  fortunate that she had clung to the midshipman with all her strength, otherwise  she would have shared the fate of her petticoats. As she herself afterwards  said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I had hardly any clothes  on amongst all those brutes of sailors, my dear, and really I don&rsquo;t know what I  said and did, or what I ought to have said and done.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was affirmed &mdash; but no  doubt this was only malicious gossip &mdash; that Mrs. Chudlepip made the handsome  young midshipman an offer of her heart and Three-per-cents. Perhaps, however,  he had some doubts as to the propriety of marrying his grandmother; for it is  stated by those who should know, that Captain Sellars, of H.M.S. Termagant,  married a German-Dutch lady whose maiden name was Van Leyt. It is a matter of  certainty, however, that Mrs. Chudlepip, on her demise, left Ernest Sellars a  handsome fortune.</p>

<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></h3>
<p>During a solitary tour  which I took some three or four years ago in Germany, I one morning received  the following laconic epistle from my friend Everard Conyers:</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Hotel des Quatre  Saisons, W &mdash; ,<br>
  June 3d, 186 &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;DEAR OLD FELLOW, &mdash; If  this reaches you at Heidelberg, as I hope it will, and you are able to tear  yourself away from the delights of Prince Rupert&rsquo;s Tower, and the inebriated  riots of the enlightened Teutonic students, spare me a day or two at W &mdash; .</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;I am no longer, literally  speaking, tied here by the leg; but what say you if other ties have thrown their  noose around me? I want you to help me with your advice, as to whether or not I  shall rivet them around my neck once and for ever!</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;I will engage a room for  you at my hotel. Come, there&rsquo;s a good fellow! &mdash; Yours, &amp;c.</p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;EVERARD CONYERS.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;For the last seven or  eight years of our lives Everard Conyers and I had been fast friends, and there  were few or none in the world dearer to me than he. Nor did I stand altogether  alone in this partiality, for Everard&rsquo;s attractions were such as neither young  nor old, as a rule, either resisted or attempted to resist.</p>
<p>To say that he was young,  handsome, and brilliant, of good fortune, connections, and gentlemanly tastes,  is merely to mention certain qualifications which he shared with others; but  beyond this, there was about Everard Conyers an almost womanly tenderness, of  which many a one, and I fear some of the fairer creation to their cost, had  experienced the charm.</p>
<p>I arrived at W &mdash; the  evening of the day on which I received Conyers&rsquo; letter.</p>
<p>After dinner we went out  together to the gardens of the Kursaal.</p>
<p>He was delighted to see  me, dear old fellow, and looked better than I had expected to see him. He had,  so he said, entirely recovered from the rheumatic affection (brought on by  lying on the wet grass after cricketing) to cure which he had first visited W &mdash;  .</p>
<p>Therefore I imagined his  prolonged stay to be solely occasioned by the &lsquo;other ties&rsquo; to which he had  alluded in his letter.</p>
<p>He did not, however,  mention the subject at dinner, but talked very fast on a variety of irrelevant  points, and professed an immense appetite; and I, for my part, was quite  satisfied that he should choose his own time and manner of making me his  confidant.</p>
<p>There was a ball that  night in the great hall of the Kursaal: such a ball as frequently occurs at W &mdash;;  by no means a dressed affair, no toilet being considered necessary for the  occasion beyond the removal of hat or bonnet on the part of the young ladies;  while between the dances, the performers strolled about amidst the crowd  outside the Kursaal, and drank coffee and ate ices beneath the trees.</p>
<p>Conyers had a ticket for  the ball; but after standing with me for a moment or so behind the screen which  on this evening, for the accommodation of the dancers, divided the great hall  from the rest of the apartments, he declared the orchestra stationed in the  gallery above to be intolerably loud and &lsquo;bruyant,&rsquo; and drew me on to a room at  the side, from whence proceeded the unmistakable chink of money, quite audible  amidst the noise of pattering feet, the hum of voices, and the undulating rise  and fall of the Strauss waltz.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Playing high to-night,&rsquo;  said he, after a minute or so, during which he and I had stationed ourselves among  the spectators at one of the gambling-tables.</p>
<p>So saying, he threw down  a napoleon. The ball in the middle of the table pursued its course with the  usual dull rattle; and Everard&rsquo;s napoleon, in company with many another, fell a  prey to the long rake of the croupier.</p>
<p>He tried another and  another, then two, and lost persistently; shrugged his shoulders slightly, took  my arm, and walked away.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No luck to-night,&rsquo; said  he. &lsquo;I sadly want <em>her</em> to tell me the  lucky numbers.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you indulge in much  of this kind of sport, then, if sport you call it?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>He looked in my face and  laughed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, no; merely as an  amusement &mdash; at least not systematically. My dear fellow, if you&rsquo;d been at W &mdash; as  long as I, you&rsquo;d have discovered a turn at the tables quite a necessity of  life, in fact the only thing to do; there&rsquo;s nothing else beyond mooning in the  gardens and making excursions to the forest, both of which become monotonous  after a time &mdash; at least they did so till &mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here he broke off  suddenly, perceiving an acquaintance in an adjoining apartment.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be back in a  minute,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I want to speak to that fellow, and ask if he and his will be  of my party to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Left alone, I strolled  out into the gardens amidst the gaily-dressed crowd. The evening was hot; but there  either was, or seemed to be, a certain coolness by the side of the artificial  lake which lies in front of the Kursaal.</p>
<p>Sitting here, my  attention was presently attracted by a figure coming towards me.</p>
<p>It was that of a  flower-girl. She was &lsquo;petite,&rsquo; evidently French, and in age I should say  somewhere about thirty, simply dressed in some dark colour, and wearing at her  side a little leathern pouch, into which those who took a rose from the basket  she held upon her arm put what return they chose.</p>
<p>I have said that she was  small, and her face was pale, almost sallow; but many a high-born lady might  have envied the simple dignity, the innate grace, of her bearing; and when she  smiled she was charming.</p>
<p>Some among the crowd  appeared known to her, and she had a smile or a word or two for all these; but  to strangers, or those perhaps whom she considered too pressing in their  attentions, she was gravity and decorum itself.</p>
<p>But above this, she had a  story in her face. I felt sure of it, as I watched her coming slowly towards me  among the crowd; a kind of questioning, searching look in her great eyes, as if  she sought for some one or something; and this habit from long use had, as it  were, grown into and become part of her life. I held out my hand for a rose,  still keeping my eyes on her face &mdash; I fear rather too intently for good manners  &mdash; and as I did so, I saw it change, the pale face became if possible a shade  paler, and a kind of sudden fire or intense light shone in her eyes.</p>
<p>She was looking beyond  me, and almost involuntarily I followed the direction of her eyes with mine,  and saw Everard Conyers, and by his side two ladies: one oldish, and quite  magnificently attired, even among that gorgeous assembly, in purple silk and  lace; the other a young lady, all in snowy white, most delicately fair, and in  form and feature simply the most beautiful woman my eyes had ever rested on.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur, d&eacute;sire-t-il  une rose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I lifted my eyes to the  pale face of the flower-girl, took the rose she gave me, and put something into  her little leathern pouch.</p>
<p>As she passed away,  Conyers&rsquo; voice at my side said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Leighton, you must let  me present you to Madame la Comtesse de Beauvilliers, and to her daughter la  Comtesse Hilda. &mdash; Madame,&rsquo; to the old lady, &lsquo;this is my best earthly friend;  let me entreat of you,&rsquo; he added, laughing, &lsquo;to bestow upon him some portion of  the favour, and of you, Comtesse Hilda, some of the smiles, which have of late  days made me the happiest among mortals!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mais, monsieur, j&rsquo;en  serai enchant&eacute;e,&rsquo; said the Comtesse de Beauvilliers, extending her hand to me &agrave;  l&rsquo;Anglaise; while the Comtesse Hilda honoured me with a profound and graceful  reverence, but said nothing.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards I  found myself walking up and down in company with the old Comtesse; Everard and  the daughter strolling on together in front.</p>
<p>Madame la Comtesse was  very gracious and affable, and very full of conversation, which she conducted  in a mixture of French and broken English.</p>
<p>Was this my first visit  to W &mdash;?</p>
<p>No; I had known it in  former years.</p>
<p>She had done the same.  For her part she was heartily sick of the place; and if it were not for a  certain &lsquo;soup&ccedil;ond&rsquo;un rhumatisme,&rsquo; and because the air suited the delicate  health of her daughter la Comtesse Hilda, she would not remain there another  hour; it was a &lsquo;wicked place, les morales y &eacute;taient tr&egrave;s basses.&rsquo; How very  seldom, for instance, it was your fate at W &mdash; to make the acquaintance of a  young man like my esteemed friend Monsieur Everard Conyers &mdash; a young man &lsquo;enfin  si frais, si pur, si comme il faut,&rsquo; &mdash; so different, in fact, from the general  run of W &mdash; society!</p>
<p>So he may be, thought I;  but I very much doubt, Madame la Comtesse, whether even his purity, however  great, will long stand the contaminating influence of society such as yours and  that of your daughter.</p>
<p>For as she talked, and  rambled sweetly on, and at length, though very cautiously, slid from the  contemplation of Everard&rsquo;s moral qualities to the far more important question  of his social position in England, and the extent of his income, trying  (though, as I flatter myself, in vain) to obtain from me some precise idea as  to what they might be, I brought both eyes and ears to bear pretty acutely upon  her, and with even greater intentness upon the fair and faultless vision moving  in front of me.</p>
<p>In some early paintings,  the Evil Spirit who first tempted our parents to sin is represented with a  serpent&rsquo;s body indeed, surmounted, however, by the head and shoulders of a  faultlessly beautiful woman; and in the perfect lines of the perfect face there  is nothing even to suggest wickedness or guile, far less degradation, shame,  and that great mystery &mdash; death; nothing to provoke a shudder or cause distrust,  save the one fact, that the beautiful mask is a mask, quite expressionless,  apparently immovable.</p>
<p>Some such reminiscence or  uncomfortable idea as this floated through my mind as I watched the Comtesse  Hilda walking by the side of Everard Conyers.</p>
<p>She listened indeed, and  answered and smiled; but the smile was the smile of the lips &mdash; not the eyes &mdash; and  displayed to perfection the pearly even teeth in all their symmetry and  whiteness.</p>
<p>And yet she was  beautiful; and it seemed to me that her beauty dazzled the eyes and burned into  the very soul of Everard Conyers.</p>
<p>I could see him grow more  earnest and low-toned in what he said to her; and there was a kind of tender  impassioned look in his honest blue eyes, for which indeed her face seemed to  possess the attractions of a magnet.</p>
<p>In the distance the  undulating sounds of the Strauss waltz swelled and sank upon the breeze, and  the moon rose high and solemnly above the trees of the garden.</p>
<p>Madame la Comtesse m&egrave;re &mdash;  basilisk-eyed &mdash; played her part to perfection, keeping well behind, and eying  the pair &mdash; so it seemed to me &mdash; much as a hungry spider might eye a couple of  fat and well-conditioned flies hovering upon the verge of the fatal web.</p>
<p>After a time, however,  she appeared to weary of my conversation; and well she might, considering the  meaningless platitudes with which I favoured her; but whether she set me down  as half knave or half fool, I do not know.</p>
<p>Certain personages among  the crowd enjoyed the honour of Madame la Comtesse&rsquo;s acquaintanceship: some she  greeted with a stately bend of recognition; with others she was empress&eacute;e in  the extreme; and one, a young effac&eacute;-looking man, with a handsome face and a  general air of effeteness and satiety about him, she introduced to me as  Monsieur le Comte, her son.</p>
<p>At length Madame la  Comtesse became suddenly affected by a violent &lsquo;crise de toux,&rsquo; and shortly  after this the Comtesse Hilda and her companion turned round so as to meet us;  whereupon the Comtesse m&egrave;re declared it time to leave the festive scene of the  Kursaal and return home.</p>
<p>Everard, who had at first  appeared a good deal crestfallen at the idea, consoled himself by reflecting  that the day of his f&ecirc;te chainp&ecirc;tre had well-nigh set in, for it was already  close on midnight.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will four o&rsquo;clock in the  afternoon suit you, Madame la Comtesse?&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;the heat will not be too  great in the forest at that hour, and I promise to provide amusement for you as  far as I can, and at any rate eatables, among the sylvan shades. The Comtesse  Hilda will, I expect, appear as a dryad,&rsquo; added he, smiling at her.</p>
<p>The three departed  together, Everard escorting the ladies home.</p>
<p>I promised to meet him at  the hotel on his return, and in the mean while strolled along the quiet paths  by the side of the water, meditating on what I had seen, and considering what I  should say to Conyers, were he to ask my advice and opinion on the subject.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s in love, I  reflected, and therefore no words of mine &mdash; did I possess the tongue of  Demosthenes and the wisdom of Socrates &mdash; are likely to make much difference to  him; he will simply put me down as dense and prejudiced, and, it may even be,  jealous.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>I started, and looked  round. At my side stood the flower-girl, very pale, very quiet, very composed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;you  are a friend to Monsieur Everard Conyers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I said I was, too much  astonished to say anything else.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can read faces,&rsquo; said  she, &lsquo;and I trust yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Seeing, perhaps, a shade  of suspicion, or at least amazement, in my expression at being thus accosted,  she went on:</p>
<p>&lsquo;I know what you would  say. You wish to know who I am, and what Monsieur Everard Conyers and his  affairs can be to me.&rsquo; (She spoke very slowly, pronouncing her words carefully  and distinctly, as one who wished to make herself understood.) &lsquo;I will tell  you. I am a poor flower-girl, and my name is Marie Dupin. Once, a year ago, I  was in danger, and quite defenceless. I thought for a moment there was no one  in the wide world to help me. Monsieur Conyers rescued me, monsieur; if he had  been my own brother, he could not have done so more nobly or more generously;  and I would give my life for him, and think I did but pay a rightful debt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, the colour  rose to her cheeks, and made her for the moment positively beautiful.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, Marie,&rsquo; said I,  &lsquo;what is the danger from which you would at present save Monsieur Conyers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; she answered  quietly, &lsquo;from the hands of the wicked Comtesse de Beauvilliers, and from those  of her beautiful and worthless daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And have you, then,  proofs,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;that the Comtesse de Beauvilliers is wicked, or, I will say,  designing, and her daughter worthless?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;deadly  proofs. But let me in return, monsieur, ask you a question. Has Monsieur  Conyers much money &mdash; very much?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He has a good fortune,  and certain expectations,&rsquo; I answered half unconsciously, speaking the exact  truth to this flower-girl, as if she had been the tried associate of my life.  But something in her earnestness and simplicity impressed me in spite of  myself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, it is as I thought!&rsquo;  said she. &lsquo;They will suck him like a leech, ruin him for this world and the  next, if they could; and then, unless the Comtesse Hilda thinks the remains of  his fortune sufficiently large, she will throw him away like an empty husk or a  worn-out shoe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I must hear more of  this,&rsquo; I exclaimed. &lsquo;You believe, then, the Comtesse and her daughter to be  mere adventurers &mdash; trading on the good faith and evident admiration of Monsieur  Conyers &mdash; tempting him to gamble, and perhaps lend them money for the same  purpose. You do not suspect the Comtesse Hilda of ulterior designs &mdash; in fact,  that she intends, if possible, to become the wife of Monsieur Conyers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I cannot say, monsieur,&rsquo;  answered Marie quietly. &lsquo;The Comtesse Hilda has been tossed about in the world  for many a long day; she may wish to secure a home for herself, and imagines  Monsieur Conyers to be in a position to provide her with one. But Heaven knows  she shall not attain her end unobstructed, while I live to tear from his eyes  the bandage which she has drawn around them! I tell you, monsieur, that on her  white hand there is the stain of blood!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The stain of blood!&rsquo; I  repeated.</p>
<p>Marie nodded, and her  great eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do not ask me whose,&rsquo;  she said; &lsquo;for his sake, perhaps, I might have spared her &mdash; for he loved her. I  do not ask revenge; I only ask to save the man who once saved me; and that,  Heaven helping me, I will do speedily. But it grows late, and I must leave you.  Good-night, monsieur!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Stay, Marie,&rsquo; said I,  &lsquo;let me beg of you to stay. The truth of your suspicions cannot fail to be of  paramount importance to me on account of my friend. Can you give me no clue, no  hint as to their nature and extent?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not to-night, monsieur!&rsquo;  she said simply. &lsquo;Nor shall my lips accuse the Comtesse Hilda. Her own lips,  her own eyes shall do that, and you will then be convinced that what I speak is  truth. Farewell!&rsquo;</p>
<p>In another minute Marie  Dupin had disappeared in the darkness.</p>
<h3 align="center"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></h3>
<p>On my return to the hotel  I found that Everard, to whose apartment I went, had arrived there before me.</p>
<p>He was stamping about the  room in a state of perplexity and impatience, so it appeared. One or two open  letters, evidently just arrived, lay about, and to the contents of these I  attributed this sudden change of mood, for which I should otherwise have been  at a loss to account.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah, sit down, old fellow,&rsquo;  said Everard, pushing a chair towards me and throwing himself into another. &lsquo;Well,  are you going to congratulate me? Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m one of the luckiest men  alive?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Before I answer that  question, Everard,&rsquo; said I, laughing, or attempting to laugh, &lsquo;I must know  precisely on what point my congratulations are expected.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To tell you the truth,  Leighton, I can hardly myself say; at least I am at a loss to explain in what  exact relationship I at present stand to the Comtesse Hilda. She knows, of  course, that I admire her &mdash; admire her immensely; but whether among her many  lovers &mdash; &rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Her lovers!&rsquo; I  interrupted him. &lsquo;And so, Everard, you love the Comtesse Hilda de Beauvilliers?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, what else would you  have me do?&rsquo; he exclaimed, stopping in the midst of his walk &mdash; for he had  risen, and was again tramping up and down the room. &lsquo;Surely to see her only, is  to love her!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To <em>see</em> her, yes,&rsquo; said I, with a marked emphasis on the word.</p>
<p>&lsquo;She is beautiful,&rsquo;  pursued Everard, as if talking to himself.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Most beautiful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And good and sweet as  she is beautiful. Don&rsquo;t tell me, because the old Countess may not come up to  all one&rsquo;s ideas, is foolish, vain, mercenary if you will &mdash; because she has  brought up her daughter in this style of place (and Heaven knows there can&rsquo;t be  a worse) &mdash; because maybe they have got into difficulties, having no one to  advise them&rsquo; (here his eye glanced at one of the letters on the table &mdash; which,  from its penmanship and business-like air, I judged to proceed from a man of  business or lawyer&rsquo;s clerk &mdash; as if that document was in some way connected with  the moneyed difficulties of the Comtesse de Beauvilliers), &mdash; &lsquo;in short, don&rsquo;t  tell me, Leighton, that the Comtesse Hilda is not good and pure as she is  beautiful!&rsquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with very  unnecessary warmth and vehemence, as a man does speak when he wishes rather to  convince himself than his listener of the truth of his words.</p>
<p>I kept silence. How was I  to disprove his statements? Moreover, &lsquo;the stain of blood, the stain of blood  upon that white hand,&rsquo; still rung in my ears, and perforce closed my lips.</p>
<p>As we sat thus, Everard  drew towards him the lawyer&rsquo;s letter, reread it, crushed it in his hand, and  threw it down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hang the fellow!&rsquo; said  he; &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the good of his writing to me on &ldquo;large sums of money due on the  estate, leases to be renewed, and extensive repairs necessary on the Yorkshire  property&rdquo;? I declare if he knows where the ready money&rsquo;s to come from, I don&rsquo;t;  and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is, then,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;so  expensive living at W &mdash;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well &mdash; not exactly. I  see what you&rsquo;re driving at, Leighton,&rsquo; said he, stopping short in his walk, and  looking me full in the face with his great tender eyes, in which there was a  strange light and shimmer to-night, so it struck me: &lsquo;granted that the old  Comtesse de Beauvilliers be designing, mercenary, and all the rest of it, that  does not affect the daughter, does it?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not precisely. But it  behoves you, Everard, in my opinion, before you inviolably connect your fate  with that of another, to consider under what influences and in what society she  has hitherto moved; whether your tastes, pursuits, and aims are in any way  similar; whether you may not one day discover, when it is too late, that a  great gulf lies between you &mdash; a gulf which you will then attempt to span, and  in vain!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; said  Everard, &lsquo;that I trust and love her; and if I thought this night that she loved  me as I do her, I should esteem myself the happiest of mortals.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Good-night,&rsquo; said I,  laughing. &lsquo;&ldquo;Force not the course of the river,&rdquo; I imagine to be a true axiom.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let me cap you. &ldquo;It is  better to meet a bear robbed of her whelps than a fool in his folly.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so we parted. I had  leisure to ponder these words of wisdom, and anything else which came beneath  my notice, the next day, during the morning hours of which I saw but little of  my friend.</p>
<p>In the afternoon I found  myself one of a rather large would-be-silvan party, reclining in a glade of the  beautiful forest which opens some miles from W &mdash; , and there partaking of every  delicacy of the season and out of it, in truly rustic guise; for our tablecloth  was spread upon the grass, and the company sat round on stumps and roots  covered with cushions and rugs, and ate Perigord pie and many another dainty by  the aid of two-pronged forks.</p>
<p>The banquet being at  length concluded, the servants retired with such spoils as they could lay hands  on; but the Champagne, Hoch-heimer, and Engelheimer still circulated among the  guests, who continued sitting around the remains of their feast.</p>
<p>Comtesse Hilda stationed  herself on the gnarled root of an oak, and Everard lay at her feet. Her hat she  had tossed off, and the setting sun lent a glory to the magnificent hair which  rippled down her shoulders in endless profusion.</p>
<p>The two were a little  withdrawn from the rest, and Comtesse Hilda, looking down, played with a bunch  of wild-roses which Everard had picked for her, and apparently listened with great  attention to his conversation.</p>
<p>A good deal of talking  and laughing went on among the guests, most of whom were apparently well  acquainted with one another; but I, a stranger, had leisure for observation.</p>
<p>So, I noticed, had a  certain fiercely moustached and whiskered individual, who sat nearly opposite  Comtesse Hilda and her companion. He too, I learned, was something of a  stranger at W &mdash;, and enjoyed the reputation of great riches. On him the  Comtesse Hilda, every now and then looking up from her lap and the flowers  which lay upon it, turned her eyes. Sitting thus, we suddenly became conscious  of a sweet voice singing an old French melody, the sounds of which came wafted  to us through the wood, now loud, now soft, now dying away upon the breeze; and  at the end of a long vista we beheld the small graceful figure of a woman  coming towards us, a flower-basket on her arm.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marie Dupin!&rsquo; exclaimed  Everard, springing up; &lsquo;the very thing! I know of no sweeter voice in the world  than Marie&rsquo;s &mdash; save one,&rsquo; he added, smiling at the Comtesse. He filled a glass  with Hochheimer and took it to Marie, who was now close to us. &lsquo;Pledge me,  Marie,&rsquo; he said.</p>
<p>She put away the wine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Merci, monsieur, je n&rsquo;en  prends jamais. &mdash; Les messieurs et mesdames, d&eacute;sirent-ils de roses?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everard slipped a piece  of gold into Marie&rsquo;s pouch.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Distribute them  yourself, Marie,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and then sing to us, anything &mdash; a French ballad &mdash; we  are not difficult to please; n&rsquo;est-ce pas, mes amis?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will do so with  pleasure, monsieur,&rsquo; said Marie. She then went round the circle, distributing a  rose and leaf to each in turn.</p>
<p>As she paused before the  Comtesse Hilda and gave her a crimson rose, the most beautiful in the basket, I  fancied a shade of distrust, like the morning film upon the sky, crossed that  perfect face. Marie sat down upon a stump, folded her small hands upon her lap,  and began to sing, very softly at first and slowly, some old French crooning  melody, such as a peasant might croon to her child, therewith to quiet its  murmurs and hush it into calm, but in a voice so full, so rich, so deep, that  you could not choose but listen. From this she passed into something very  spirited, quick, gay, lively; and at the end of her performance received  immense applause.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sing us one more song,  Marie,&rsquo; said Everard, who still lay at the feet of the Comtesse Hilda.</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I shall weary this  company,&rsquo; said she.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said one or  two: &lsquo;sing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And the Comtesse Hilda  laughed a little silvery laugh, and said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sing us a love-song,  child. Don&rsquo;t you know one?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oui, Madame la Comtesse,&rsquo;  said Marie gently; &lsquo;shall I sing it?&rsquo; and began.</p>
<p>It was a quaint old  melody this time; very peculiar, very pathetic, with an ever-recurring refrain  &mdash; </p>
<p class="note">&lsquo;Te reverrai-je done,<br>
O mes ch&egrave;res montagnes d&rsquo;Alsace?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&mdash; many verses long.</p>
<p>As the song proceeded,  Comtesse Hilda turned pale as death, and round her eyes rose great circles.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pardon,&rsquo; said Marie,  stopping suddenly; &lsquo;Madame la Comtesse se trouve mal!&rsquo;</p>
<p>A bomb falling in the  midst of us could hardly have astonished us more.</p>
<p>That this dryad, this  Diana, this goddess of the feast, should suddenly falter and fail, and her  wonderful ripe beauty assume the hues of mortal weakness, appeared utterly  incongruous, and, but for the fact, well-nigh impossible.</p>
<p>&lsquo;C&rsquo;est la chaleur; ma  fille est d&rsquo;une sant&eacute; d&eacute;licate,&rsquo; said the old Comtesse, going towards her; &lsquo;un  peu d&rsquo;eau, Monsieur Conyers, et cela se passera.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So it proved; for in a  minute or so, during which Everard, kneeling at her feet, had chafed her hands  between his own, Comtesse Hilda opened her eyes, smiled at her anxious adorer,  and declared herself quite restored.</p>
<p>During the confusion  which this little scene had occasioned, Marie Dupin, the flower-girl, had  disappeared.</p>
<p>The party did not return  to W &mdash; till late. We drove through the forest by the most beautiful  clair-de-lune I had ever witnessed, which caused every tree and every forest  glade to assume an unreal and spiritual appearance, while not a sound was to be  heard save that of our own voices and the noise of the carriage-wheels. I  slept somewhat late the next morning; and ere I had risen, was more or less  surprised by receiving a visit from Everard, who, after a hasty knock at the  door, entered without farther ceremony, and threw himself down in the armchair  by the side of the bed.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Are you awake?&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes &mdash; no; in what can I  serve you at this untimely hour?&rsquo; I answered, rubbing my eyes, so as to obtain  a better view of my visitant, which ended in my exclaiming:</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have not been in bed  all night! That, at least, is very clear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You&rsquo;re about right there,&rsquo;  said he. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep; so what&rsquo;s the good? What do you think of this ?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He took from his pocket a  small square parcel tied round with a piece of scarlet ribbon.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Think of it? how can I  tell, till I know the contents? Is it this parcel which has caused you a  night&rsquo;s unrest, Everard? If so, I must at least ask &mdash; first to untie the  ribbon, in order to learn what the packet may contain; and secondly how you  came by it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No &mdash; no! don&rsquo;t untie it,&rsquo;  said Everard, putting out his hand, &lsquo;and I will tell you my story.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I noticed now that he  looked very worn and weary &mdash; far more so than a single night&rsquo;s unrest  warranted.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; said he,  &lsquo;after the Comtesse Hilda had recovered from her fainting-fit, the party broke  up into little coteries.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Comtesse and I  wandered away in company with two or three others; but after a time our  companions dropped off, and she and I found ourselves alone.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I daresay you remember,  Leighton,&rsquo; said he, smiling, &lsquo;that in our nursery days we used to be informed  that the rays of the full moon upon the head produced madness &mdash; probably about  as true an axiom as other old-wives&rsquo; fables; but whatever the cause, I believe  I was mad last night.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It seemed to me,  Leighton, as if my whole life concentrated itself into those few minutes &mdash; for  it could hardly have been longer &mdash; during which she and I stood together in the  forest.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I told her I loved her;  and she &mdash; she did not reject me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You remember, when at  length all the company assembled in order to return to W &mdash; , some mistake  occurred about the carriages, and I followed the servants and others who had  gone in search of them, in order to make sure of all being right; when, turning  an angle in the path, I perceived at a little distance two figures &mdash; a man, and  by his side Marie Dupin. On seeing me, the man turned aside, but not before I  had recognised in him Count R&mdash; , who, as I told you, has been but a short time  at W &mdash; , and is very little known except by name.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Marie came on and met  me.</p>
<p>&lsquo;When I saw her face, I  started; there was such a strange look on it, and her eyes were full of tears. </p>
<p>&ldquo;The carriages are on the  road, monsieur,&rsquo; she said, &ldquo;and will be there by the time you return. Can you  spare me a few minutes? I have something to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Of course I complied;  and walked on with her. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; she said,  &ldquo;that man, Count R&mdash; , is a minister of police. He is here on the track of the  Comtesse de Beauvilliers and her daughter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you what I  said, Leighton. I believe if I had been shot near the heart, I should have felt  it less. She went on quietly: &ldquo;Not long ago the Comtesse de Beauvilliers and  the Comtesse Hilda resided at Berlin. They left the place suddenly and  secretly, not without suspicion of having been engaged in a political intrigue  of no creditable nature, for the purpose of obtaining money.&rdquo; (She said all  this, Leighton; and I heard it.) &ldquo;Since then circumstances have come to light  which have put the police on their track; and if they wish for safety, they  must leave W &mdash; to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I turned on her then,  Leighton; I was half wild, and she a woman. If she had been a man, I believe I  should have struck her down on the spot; but I thank Heaven I was spared that!</p>
<p>&lsquo;She only turned paler  and paler, and looked at me with her great strange eyes, which haunt me still.  Then she said: </p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur, it is not as  you say. I am no spy, no hunter of women like myself. I have told nothing to  the police-agent; and any proofs he may possess are not of my handiwork, or  obtained by my connivance. You may still save the honour of those dear to you,  monsieur, by means of the warning I have given you; but in return I make one  stipulation with you. Visit the Comtesse Hilda; give her this packet, and make  her open it in your presence; then, monsieur, you will see if I have reason in  my words, if I have cause to warn you against the Comtesse Hilda.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&lsquo;When she had said this,  she gave a great sigh, Leighton, as if her heart was almost broken, and turned  away; but I made her stop, and begged her to tell me what she knew and what she  meant. But she refused, and said, &ldquo;I will meet you to-morrow at the Comtesse de  Beauvilliers&rsquo;s, monsieur; till then I keep silence.&rdquo; And she went.&rsquo; </p>
<p>He ceased speaking.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Give me the parcel,&rsquo; I  said, and took it. The paper in which it was folded was somewhat worn and  sullied, and the ribbon faded. I judged that the parcel had been tied up not  recently, but some two or three years since.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go into the next room,&rsquo;  I said; &lsquo;I will join you in ten minutes, and we will go together to the Comtesse  de Beauvilliers&rsquo;s.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will not go there,&rsquo;  said Everard, who was sitting, his head sunk in his hands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, you will. If there  is nothing in that packet to compromise the Comtesse Hilda, so much the better;  in that case the story of the Berlin intrigue may be also false; if not, the  sooner you warn her that W &mdash; is no longer a safe residence for her, the more  you will serve her interests.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, he  and I stood at the door of the Countess&rsquo;s apartments; Everard changed and worn  by that night of agony, as if by the effects of a long and terrible illness.</p>
<p>They were all together in  the little drawing-room: the Countess Hilda sitting by the window; the old  Countess in the easiest of easy-chairs, and attired in a magnificent n&eacute;glig&eacute;  costume, sipping chocolate; and leaning behind her, weariness the predominant  expression of his handsome womanish face, stood the young Count, her son.</p>
<p>There was a little  antechamber to the room, and I was dimly conscious of some one noiselessly  entering therein behind us. Not so the inmates of the room, who were all struck  aghast by the change in Everard&rsquo;s appearance.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mais, qu&rsquo;est que c&rsquo;est,  monsieur?&rsquo; exclaimed the old Countess.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Vous ne vous trouvez  done pas bien portant ce matin?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Countess Hilda looked  at him in astonishment, thinking, no doubt, was this the guise in which he came  to claim her as his affianced bride? and a shade of terror and distrust passed,  as it were, from his countenance to hers.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Countess Hilda,&rsquo; said  Everard in a low tone, which sounded strangely in the silence of the room, &lsquo;may  I request you to open this parcel in my presence?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the indignant blood  rushed to the Countess&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, sir. I will do  nothing of the kind. May I inquire by what right you presume to make such a  request?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The right of loving  you,&rsquo; said Everard, in a still lower voice.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And who has instigated  you to so extraordinary a course?&rsquo; continued the Countess; and as Everard was  silent, &lsquo;Go, leave the room!&rsquo; said she passionately. &lsquo;Your conduct admits of no  excuse.&rsquo;</p>
<p>As she spoke, her eyes  fell upon some one who stood in the doorway looking at her, the Countess Hilda,  fixedly &mdash; Marie Dupin. She advanced into the room.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comtesse Hilda de  Beauvilliers,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if you will not open this parcel, I will do it for  you.&rsquo; So saying, she tore off the cover and opened the lid of a little silver  box. Within it lay two things: a diamond ring, and a thick lock of fair hair of  the colour called &lsquo;blond cendr&eacute;&rsquo; dabbled in and stiffened with blood.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do you know that hair,  Countess?&rsquo; said the flower-girl. It seemed she did; for she wavered, faltered,  looked round at her mother, who had risen in alarm, and the young Count, who  came forward angrily, and then sank rigidly into the chair behind her, staring  at Marie Dupin.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Get out of the house,  woman, or it will be the worse for you!&rsquo; exclaimed the Count.</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, no; let her speak,&rsquo;  said Comtesse Hilda, with a strange kind of laugh &mdash; &lsquo;let her speak!&rsquo; And Marie  Dupin did speak, and said,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, Comtesse, it is  three years ago since he died, my foster-brother Count Maurice de Bergue &mdash; died  by his own hand; but the stain of his blood lies on your white hands, Comtesse  Hilda de Beauvilliers &mdash; on you and on your mother!</p>
<p>&lsquo;God knows he loved you!  And you led him on, and made him believe that you too loved him; you led him on  &mdash; shall I say it, Comtesse? &mdash; into wickedness, into vice &mdash; in the midst of that  whirlpool, Paris, he, so young and fresh from our Auvergne mountains. You  taught him to gamble, and &mdash; you were a potent instructress &mdash; to forget everything  in the world but you, and the desire to make money, that he might pour it at  your feet. Then, when luck turned against him, and instead of gaining he lost,  and still he sought you, then you laughed at him; and one day, Comtesse, when  he wearied you, and you were aiming at far higher game, to which he had served  as decoy duck long enough, so you thought, you jested at him and his pretensions,  gloried in the new conquest you had made, threw him back the diamond ring he  had given you, and denied the possibility of bestowing your hand upon a ruined  man! Do you remember it, Comtesse?&rsquo; Comtesse Hilda bowed her white face. &lsquo;You  know what followed? You know why this hair is all dabbled in blood! He lay one  morning, stiff and cold and dead, across the threshold of his own door &mdash; he, my  brother, with the ring you had once worn against his heart!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Her voice sank here, and  faltered for the first time.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You shall pay for this!  Leave the house, woman!&rsquo; said the Count, and raised his hand as if to force her  to do so.</p>
<p>She looked at him very  much as one might look at an insect beneath one&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>&lsquo;It is not for vengeance  that I speak!&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;if it were, Heaven knows there is many a surer path  by which I might have compassed it. But vengeance will surely follow such deeds  as yours, Comtesse Hilda!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Comtesse de  Beauvilliers! Comtesse Hilda!&rsquo; she continued, raising her voice, &lsquo;be warned,  while there is time. The Berlin police are on your track &mdash; there is no longer  safety for you at W &mdash;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spy!&rsquo; shrieked the  Count, turning upon Marie with a fearful oath. The old Comtesse, with a  smothered exclamation, sank back upon her couch; but the Comtesse Hilda laughed  a little scornful laugh.</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the better,&rsquo; said  she; &lsquo;our career at W &mdash; seems to be terminated, and we will leave it to-day.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Monsieur,&rsquo; said she,  turning upon Everard, &lsquo;I imagine you no longer desire the fulfilment of those  vows which you last night swore to me with such fidelity?</p>
<p>&lsquo;This woman informs you  that there is blood upon my hands, and perhaps she speaks truth.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go, and rejoice in her  society, if you will, upon the peril you have escaped, and gloat over the  dexterity and address which have enabled you publicly to degrade the woman you  professed to adore!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Everard had not spoken  until now, but stood like one in a dream, struck dumb, and rooted to the spot &mdash;  as if from the effects of some horrible enchantment.</p>
<p>But as the Comtesse rose  to leave the room, he turned his face, and his white lips murmured:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hilda. God forgive you,  as I do!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she stopped, looked  at him with great wide-opened eyes, and came near him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Kiss me!&rsquo; she said &mdash; and  he kissed her &mdash; &lsquo;for,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I loved you!&rsquo;</p>
<p>For many days after this  Everard Conyers lay between life and death; and even after the fever had left  him, such great weakness remained behind, that it was for some time doubtful  which of the two would prove victorious. But he was young, and ultimately so  far recovered as to enable me to remove him from W &mdash; . This was a great point  gained; for here everything was fraught to him with painful recollections of  bygone joys. Nevertheless, so great was the apathy into which he had fallen,  that I much doubt whether he even thanked me for my pains; and I was well  aware, that though I had succeeded in removing his bodily presence from W &mdash; , I  had no such power over his mind, which &mdash; in as far as it had strength to cling  to anything &mdash; remained obstinately rooted to the reminiscences of the past.</p>
<p>He would sit for hours  moodily silent, never mentioning the names of those with whom he had been of late  connected, save once: and that to ask whether they, the Beauvilliers, had left  W &mdash; in safety. But when he was ill, and raving in delirium, the name of &lsquo;Hilda&rsquo;  was ever on his lips.</p>
<p>One night, when he was at  the worst, a light knock sounded at the door, and some one softly entered &mdash; Marie  Dupin, smaller, paler, more ethereal than ever. She came up to the bed and  looked at him.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Will he die?&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I  have killed him! It is all my work!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, Marie,&rsquo; I said; &lsquo;on  the contrary, you have saved him from a great peril. I believe that he will  live; if not, there is a living death far worse than the mere death of the  body.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He does not know me,&rsquo;  she said in her old gentle way; &lsquo;he must not.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Then she smoothed the  pillows with her soft womanly hand, and went away quietly.</p>
<p>One evening, about a  month after the time I first moved Everard from W &mdash; , we were sitting together  on the balcony of a little inn at a tiny seaport on the coast of Normandy. He  was already far better for the fresh sea-air and the quietness and primitive  life which prevailed in the village of C &mdash; , where, indeed, no greater  excitement was to be found than that occasioned by the outgoings and incomings  of the sea-faring inhabitants on fishing excursions, and nothing marked the  flight of time save the rising and setting of the sun, and the tinkling of the  church-bell for matins and vespers.</p>
<p>I had been reading to  him, and on laying down my book it struck me very forcibly, that I saw before  me very nearly the Everard of old times; so that I felt emboldened to say,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Everard, I have  something to tell you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what?  Anything pleasant?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Comtesse Hilda de  Beauvilliers is married; I read it this morning in the Paris paper.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Married!&rsquo; said he.</p>
<p>&lsquo;To some French marquis,  with many names and more titles, at the church of La Madeleine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>My last remembrance of  Everard Conyers is a very recent and a very pleasant one.</p>
<p>Three years have elapsed  since he and I returned to England together.</p>
<p>One warm evening, a week  or so ago, I was paddling down the Thames amongst the rushes and reeds and  forget-me-nots which grow by its margin, and presently relaxed my efforts and  let my boat float to land just where a little green lawn slopes down to the  edge of the water.</p>
<p>About a hundred yards  higher up, nestling among a clump of trees, stands a cottage clad all over with  ivy and cluster-roses. The French windows open down to the ground, and at the  sound of my call two figures emerged therefrom: Everard Conyers, blithe and  hale and sunburnt, all his dear old face lighted up with the pleasant smile I  used to say he specially kept for me and for one other, she who now stood by  his side; a slight figure, a sweet quiet face with great calm eyes &mdash; his wife,  Marie Dupin. </p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="OurTripToLochKillnoyOrTheFlyingScud"></a>Our Trip To Loch Killnoy, Or The Flying  Scud</strong></h2>
<p>Is there anybody, I  wonder, who, at some time or other in his life, has not visited the west coast  of Scotland? If such a one exists, I would strongly recommend him to do so; at  least I know that is the opinion to which we unanimously came in the cabin of  the schooner yacht Flying Scud, as we were enjoying a cigar and a glass of grog  prior to turning in for the night; the &lsquo;we&rsquo; aforesaid being comprised of Henry  Harlowe, aged twenty-seven, only lately come into a large fortune,  good-looking, good-tempered, and entered on the books of the &lsquo;Chaperones&rsquo; and  Mothers of Marriageable Daughters&rsquo; Society&rsquo; as a most eligible <em>parti</em>; secondly, of Captain Alexander  Northcombe, late of the 85th Dragoons, and now getting through time by spending  four months in town, another month or two in a cruise, and the rest of the year  in visiting at the hundred-and-one country houses where Captain Alec is always  a welcome guest; for he is up to everything, from private theatricals to being placed  at the warm corner of a covert when a big bag is wanted; thirdly and lastly, of  myself, described in the last census as being of &lsquo;no occupation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well, having introduced  you to ourselves, let me try to give you an idea of our ship. One of Harry&rsquo;s first  proceedings on coming into his kingdom was to build a yacht, such as he had  often declared that as soon as he could he would build. During our former  cruises in a little twenty-ton cutter, we had often laid our heads together to  scheme what the new yacht was to be; and the Flying Scud was the result of  those cogitations. She was a schooner of about one hundred and twelve tons,  with comfortable accommodation for five people, and, judging from one or two  little trials we had had in the north, very fast.</p>
<p>We were at this time,  about 11 P.M., off Lamlash in the island of Arran, having left Cambeltown in  the morning; but, owing to light winds, had only made our present position. It  was a splendid night; the moon was within three or four days of the full, and threw  a broad path of light across the water, looking like a belt of molten silver;  and the Ayrshire hills, standing up in strong relief from the water, completed  a picture such as is seldom seen, even among the lochs and bays of the Scottish  highlands.</p>
<p>However, we had admired  it to the full, and were now engaged in imbibing our nightcaps and discussing  the past and the future; the past consisting in reminiscences of our trip to  Skye, and the future in anticipations of our visit to well-known &lsquo;beautiful  Loch Killnoy,&rsquo; on the borders of which Alec&rsquo;s people had taken a house for the  summer, and where we were to sail in a regatta that would be attended by many  crack yachts, and thus have a good chance of trying what the Scud could really  do.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I say, Harry,&rsquo; said  Alec, &mdash; who was stretched on one of the sofas, for he had a great idea of his  own comfort &mdash; &lsquo;just put me the least drop more whisky in this, I&rsquo;ve made it  rather weak. Thanks. By the way, I forgot to tell you that I had a letter from  Polly&rsquo; (his sister) &lsquo;when we were in Cambeltown.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just like you, to  forget,&rsquo; cut in Harry; &lsquo;we will present you with a gold medal the day you  remember anything except dinner-time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, never mind, we  won&rsquo;t argue that point; but I&rsquo;ll just read you a bit of what she says; it&rsquo;s a  message to you two fellows, so I suppose you ought to hear it: &ldquo;You can tell  Mr. Harlowe and Mr. Middleton that I shall expect them to be very agreeable and  amusing; for there are some charming girls staying here, and there is &lsquo;no end&rsquo;  of croquet and archery and dances, and we all want to be taken out in the  yacht, and besides we have picnics and boating, and, in short, great fun.&rdquo;  There, what do you think of that, Mr. Digby Middleton and Mr. Henry Harlowe?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak to  me, for I&rsquo;m engaged in contemplating in my mind&rsquo;s eye all the bliss that is in  store for us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well for  you to talk about the pleasures that are in store for us,&rsquo; growled Harry; &lsquo;but  I appeal to your sense, if you have any, &mdash; a point, by the way, on which I am  rather doubtful, &mdash; if we are fit to shine in polite society, not to mention  such a gay whirl of dissipation as Miss Mary Northcombe so graphically  describes, after a month&rsquo;s roughing it in the north?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Alec gently murmured  through a cloud of smoke, &lsquo;Well, they must take us as they find us; and if they  don&rsquo;t like us, they need not have us.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is something in  that: &mdash; however, Digby, just pull that sleeping beauty off the sofa, and let us  go up and see how the night looks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t exert  yourself so much,&rsquo; said Alec, bringing his long body from the horizontal to the  perpendicular, and leading the way on deck.</p>
<p>There we found no change;  still almost a dead calm, as bright and as clear as ever, and, so far as I could  judge, no signs of a breeze. Donald the pilot, whom we had shipped as our  captain, was leaning against the main rigging, peering anxiously to windward  and whistling for wind. He was a thorough specimen of a Scotchman, cautious and  sure; would never commit himself to an assertion, but for all that he knew  every loch and inlet on the west coast as well as his own cottage.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, Donald, any signs  of a breeze? Shall we get up to the loch before morning?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&rsquo;Deed, yer honour,  there&rsquo;s no muckle appearance o&rsquo; it the noo; but happen we get a bit puff, I&rsquo;ll  no&rsquo; undertake to say but we might win up afore the mornen&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There, Harry, I hope you  have profited by the instruction afforded you. By the way, how goes the time,  Digby?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Just ten minutes to  eleven.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;By  Jove, is that all? I thought it was about twelve. I say, Harry, let us go below  and have a hand at &eacute;car&eacute;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well,  I don&rsquo;t mind if we do just for an hour or so. I thought it was much later, too.  Good-night, Donald, and get the square-sail on her if you have a slant of wind  in the night.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,  ay, sir, and gude-night to your honours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Well,  we went below, and having pegged the table &mdash; that is, made it fast, so that it  could not swing, for we did not expect a breeze &mdash; got out the cards, and Alec  and Harry sat down to play &mdash; Harry on the sofa and Alec on a low camp-stool &mdash; while  I mixed a little b. and s., otherwise known as brandy and soda-water. I had  just finished and put the tumblers on the table when we heard Donald exclaim:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Up  wi&rsquo; the helm; we&rsquo;ll ha&rsquo;e a fine breeze the noo.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Quick!&rsquo;  said Harry; &lsquo;unpeg the table, Alec, or we shall have all these things upset.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Poor  Alec stooped to do so, when the squall struck us, and his stool slipped from  under him, and he was deposited on the carpet; while, as the Scud heeled  rapidly over to the strong breeze, the three large tumblers slid gently off the  table, and discharged themselves and their contents into the nape of his neck,  as he rolled down the now sloping floor to the lee-side of the cabin; while  Harry and I lay on the two sofas and roared with laughter at poor Alec&rsquo;s  half-drowned appearance. However, the advent of the steward soon put things to  rights; but it had put an extinguisher on &eacute;cart&eacute;, and we went up on deck again,  where we found that the squall had steadied into a fine fresh breeze on the  quarter; we lent a hand to set the square-sail; that being done we turned in,  to be soon lulled to sleep by the wash of the water against the yacht&rsquo;s sides,  as, true to her name, she went flying along at the rate of nearly ten knots an  hour.</p>
<p>The  next morning I was aroused by Harry&rsquo;s coming into my cabin in a decidedly light  and airy costume, to inform me that we were just entering the mouth of Loch  Killnoy, and advising me to come up on deck, for, as soon as the anchor had  been let go, we would have a swim: this was farther enforced by Alec&rsquo;s putting  his head through the skylight, and stating, that if I was not on deck in the  space of one minute, he would salute me with a bucket of water when I did come.  As I knew I should have no peace, I made a virtue of necessity; and attiring  myself in what an African potentate &mdash; whose dress, according to tradition, is a  pair of spurs and a cocked hat &mdash; might consider a superfluity of clothing, put  my head up the companion, and saw for the first time &lsquo;beautiful Loch Killnoy. &rsquo;  Imagine a sheet of water about seven miles long and two broad, closed in at the  upper end by great towering jagged hills, descending almost perpendicularly to  the water&rsquo;s edge; while farther down the loch they assume a less wild  character, and though still majestic lose their points and crags, while their  bases are clothed with a thick belt of woods, out of which peep, but not  obtrusively, a few cottages and villas &mdash; and on the south side of the entrance,  placed on a natural lawn, and among some of the finest trees in Scotland,  stands the palatial residence of the Duke of &mdash;. Imagine this on a beautiful  summer&rsquo;s morning, the hazy blue of the hills, the reflections so well-defined  as almost to make the loch look like an inverted landscape &mdash; imagine all this,  if you can; and if you cannot, go and see it, and I think you&rsquo;ll agree with  Alec, when he said:</p>
<p>&lsquo;By  Jove, I say, awfully pretty, you know!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pretty,  you heathen!&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;why, it is the most splendid thing we have seen! I  say, Johnson&rsquo; (he was the sailing-master), &lsquo; shall we bring up in that bay  below the castle, where the other yachts are lying?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes,  sir; the pilot says that&rsquo;s the best anchorage.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What  schooner is that lying there?&rsquo; said I.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m  not quite sure, sir; but it looks very like the Ariadne.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I  believe it is,&rsquo; said Harry, &lsquo;and if she sails for the Cup, we&rsquo;ll soon see what  the Scud can do.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down  staysail. Are you all ready with the anchor?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay,  ay, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Down  jib.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The  helm is put down, and she comes round head to what little breeze there is.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Let  go.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Whiir-r-r,  rattle, bang, splash, and we are at anchor.</p>
<p>We  had a splendid swim in the very clear but very cold water; and having finished  breakfast, were discussing the propriety of ordering the gig, and going on  shore to call on the Northcombes and learn the plan of the campaign, when we  heard a lady&rsquo;s voice, which we recognised as Miss Polly&rsquo;s, asking &lsquo;if that was  the Flying Scud?&rsquo; We ran up on deck, and found a boat alongside, containing  Polly and four other young ladies; we took them on board, and were then  informed that they had seen the yacht come in, and being determined to surprise  us, had quietly rowed off to bring us on shore, without the mankind of their  party knowing anything about it.</p>
<p>What  a charming boat&rsquo;s crew they were! Polly was a brunette, rising twenty-one, as a  &lsquo;hossy&rsquo; man would say &mdash; of course we were introduced to the other four &mdash; and  the stroke, how shall I describe her? She was quite a different style from  Polly &mdash; fair, with lots of golden hair, like the princess in the fairy tale;  great big blue eyes, and such feet and ankles! The others were very good  specimens of what poor John Leech used to draw so well &mdash; &lsquo;English darlings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After  a vain attempt to be allowed to row them on shore, we got in and shoved off.</p>
<p>Loch  Killnoy is divided into two parts &mdash; upper and lower &mdash; by a long sandy  promontory running out from the east side, and which at high water of spring  tides is covered; but at all other times the tide runs with considerable force  through a channel comparatively narrow, but of sufficient depth to float the  largest ship in her Majesty&rsquo;s service. The Northcombes&rsquo; house was on the upper  part of the loch, but as the tide was flood we swept the narrows at a great  pace.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do  you see that house just showing through the trees, Mr. Middleton? asked Polly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Do  you mean the one a little way up the hill, with the large lawn?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes;  that&rsquo;s where Miss Herbert lives, and where all the great croquet tournaments  take place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>By  the way, Miss Blanche Herbert was the lady whom I tried to describe just now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I  hope you can all play well,&rsquo; observed the fair chatelaine.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I  think we can pass an examination in the art of croquet,&rsquo; answered Alec.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And,  Mr. Harlowe, when will you take us all out in the yacht? We do so want to go &mdash; don&rsquo;t  we?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O  yes, so much!&rsquo; was immediately chorused in reply.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Miss  Blanche Herbert,&rsquo; said Harry solemnly, &lsquo;with the exception of the day on which  we race, the yacht is entirely at your service.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How  very polite! If I were not rowing, I would make you the most profound curtsey;  but instead of that, I&rsquo;ll tell you that it is really very good of you. I vote  for to-morrow &mdash; don&rsquo;t you, Polly?&rsquo;</p>
<p>A  lively discussion as to where we were to go, and who were to be of the party, filled  up the time until we arrived at a little stone pier which ran out from the foot  of Mr. Northcombe&rsquo;s garden. Certainly no place could be better adapted for a  large party to stay at and amuse themselves than Armadale House. A velvety lawn  running down to the loch, with clumps of evergreens and laurels forming  themselves into walks apparently invented on purpose for flirtation, besides  all the amusements mentioned in Polly&rsquo;s letter, and added to this a host and  hostess who were hospitality itself, made our prospects look bright in the  extreme.</p>
<p>In  these days of express trains, Suez canals, and twenty-mile-an hour steam-boats,  it is no wonder that those whose business compels them to pass a certain time  nearly every day in a town should take advantage of the present facilities of  rapid transit, and deposit their household gods at some distance from their  offices. Nowhere is this theory more fully carried out than in the  neighbourhood of the ancient city of Glasgow. Partly by steamer and partly by  railway, merchants and brokers, bankers and manufacturers, daily go to their  toil, and as a natural consequence return by the same means; and so it happens  that wild, picturesque, and romantic spots, whose scenery and associations have  been made known to all the civilised world by the magic pen of the great wizard  of the north, Sir Walter Scott, are now dotted with the country residences of &lsquo;canny  Glasgow bodies,&rsquo; whose fathers would have thought it rank heresy to have dwelt  more than a mile from the temple of Saint Mungo. So wags the world away; and  nowadays a fast steamer puffs her smoke into the mouth of Rob Roy&rsquo;s cave as she  rushes past, while worthy Messrs. Mac Michel and Jamison, merchants of the  Trongate, Glasgow, discuss on her deck the probable result of the daring  encroachments beet-root sugar is making upon the genuine nigger productions of  Demerara.</p>
<p>Old  Northcombe &mdash; Alec&rsquo;s father &mdash; was one of these sort of worthy gentlemen. I do  not attempt to conceal the fact; but the days of looking down upon a man  because his father is in trade have passed away, and that wonderful association  known as &lsquo;society&rsquo; is just as willing to receive the heir of the  merchant-prince as the future possessor of the title of Duke of Fitznoodle.  However, in trade or not in trade, the proprietors of these said locations &mdash; to  use a Yankeeism &mdash; on the Clyde manage to have as charming a lot of daughters,  and as gentlemanlike a set of sons, as any old dowager of a past age might wish  to stigmatise and ban by saying to her dearest scandal crony, &lsquo;O yes, dear Lady  Montmatre, <em>pas mal</em>, as you say, but  then not in <em>our</em> set at all, you know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Be  that as it may, I know we three agreed that Polly&rsquo;s letter had not at all  exaggerated things; and even that rather uninteresting game of croquet, with  such partners as pretty Blanche Herbert and her numerous feminine  acquaintances, never became <em>ennuyant</em>.</p>
<p>I  must now carry you on to a week after our arrival, and put you <em>en rapport</em> with my <em>dramatis personae</em> on a Monday morning, as we were all standing on the  pier waiting for the boat to take us on board the yacht.</p>
<p>This was to be our last ladies&rsquo; trip before the race, which was to  take place on Wednesday, and the intervening Tuesday was to be devoted to  putting the Scud in proper fettle.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now tell me, Mr. Harlowe,&rsquo; said Blanche &mdash; &lsquo;do you <em>really</em> think you will win?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, I hope so; at any rate, I think your gloves are pretty safe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;m thankful to hear that; because Polly was making me quite  miserable all yesterday by saying that you had no chance against the Circe.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here I must observe, <em>entre nous</em>,  that the owner of the Circe, a fine cutter expected to arrive every day, was  engaged to Polly, so that accounts for her hostility to us. At this moment the  boat came alongside the landing-place, and having, with not more than the usual  amount of fuss &mdash; the most expressive word I can think of &mdash; succeeded in getting  the chaperone safely stowed, the girls were soon disposed of, as they were all  experienced boat women. Here I should like, if time and space would permit, to  say or rather write a few words with regard to that species of the genus female  known as the chaperone or female detective, for such nine-tenths of them are. I  do not mean to say, that if I wanted to find the man who kindly wrote my name  in mistake for his own on a cheque for 500<em>l</em>.,  which was duly honoured by my bankers&rsquo;, that I should employ one of them; but  if I wanted to know whether it was going to be a match between young  Mountchessington and Annie Mayfair, or if it could be satisfactorily proved  that Mr. A.&rsquo;s attentions to Miss B. were of such a nature as to warrant Miss  B.&rsquo;s papa in asking what Mr. A. meant, or even if I wanted a little evidence  got up in regard to a case that I thought it desirable to bring before Lord P&mdash;z&mdash;e,  commend me to a chaperone who has &mdash; note this carefully &mdash; successfully disposed  of four or five daughters, and has therefore a good sound knowledge of the art  &mdash; for art it is &mdash; of scheming.</p>
<p>Being now safely packed, we pulled out into the loch; and the Scud,  which had been some time under weigh, having gracefully rounded to and hauled  her staysail sheet to windward, thereby kindly allowing us to come alongside,  we succeeded in getting our living cargo safely on deck.</p>
<p>What fun it is, a party of ladies on board a yacht! Such questions and  such exclamations: &lsquo;how charming!&rsquo; &lsquo;how delightful!&rsquo; and the cabin being  entered &mdash; the descent to which, by the way, generally involves a considerable  display of that part of the human form divine known as &lsquo;tootsicums&rsquo; &mdash; there  arises a Babel of &lsquo;Look, Alice, books and pictures!&rsquo; &lsquo;And a piano!&rsquo; &amp;c. as  if they thought that the cabin of a yacht flying a Royal Yacht Club burgee was  furnished with nothing but bare boards. Suddenly a voice on deck is heard, &lsquo;Let  draw the staysail!&rsquo; and as the boat&rsquo;s head falls off, and she heels gently  over, there is an indiscriminate series of small shrieks as they all slide down  to the lee-side of the cabin. This little climax of course involves an  adjourning on deck, where we all gradually settle down to enjoy ourselves.  Blanche seems to find the compass an intricate study, to judge by the long time  she and Harry bend their heads together over it; Alec and I devote ourselves to  Blanche&rsquo;s sister and the two Miss Hamiltons; Polly walks forward with a firm  step, like a sailoress as she is, to consult the mate as to the probable date  of the Circe&rsquo;s arrival; and the dear old chaperone asks the captain in rather  an unsteady voice, &lsquo;if he is quite sure it is quite safe;&rsquo; to which query  Donald takes upon himself to reply more emphatically than politely, &lsquo;Hoot,  woman! what are you frightened for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>All the little incidents of the day, though very amusing at the time,  would but little interest you now; so let us pass on until about five P.M.,  when we were running back into the loch, and the question was raised by Harry,  as to whether we should go past the narrows into the upper half of the loch, or  not. After consultation with Donald, it was decided that we should, as he said  we might easily do so, and get back to our moorings soon after seven o&rsquo;clock.  To enable my readers fully to understand our situation, I must explain that  these narrows could only be gone through in safety with the tide in our favour  and the wind what sailors call abeam &mdash; that is, blowing on the side of the  vessel. It was now within an hour of high water, and the breeze in the proper  direction; so we should be able to go up with the last of the flood, and come  down with the first hour&rsquo;s ebb. All went well; we glided in safety through the  narrow passage, and spent an hour or so tacking about the upper loch, at one time  standing in close enough to recognise the members of the croquet-party on the  Northcombes&rsquo; lawn. Donald now hinted that it was time to return, and we bore  away for what Alec had christened the North-West Passage; for he declared it  must be, to judge from Donald&rsquo;s long face, as perilous as the one poor Sir John  Franklin lost his life trying to find.</p>
<p>We had gone down into the cabin, and were indulging in what ladies so  much delight in, afternoon tea, when we were startled by hearing the canvas  flapping.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; exclaimed Harry; &lsquo;if the wind dies away, and leaves us at  the mercy of the tide in the narrows, we shall go on shore to a certainty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The instant afterwards we heard the skipper call out, in quick eager  tones, to lower away the boats, and tow her head off shore. The moment I got my  head above the companion, I saw what an unpleasant scrape we were in. The  breeze had completely failed, and the eddying tide had caught the yacht, and  was taking her, broadside on, to where the short breaking ripple showed the end  of the spit which divides the upper from the lower Loch Killnoy. The only  chance of preventing her going on shore was to tow clear of the point, and the  men were exerting every nerve to do so, while Donald danced about the deck in a  state of almost rabid excitement. A few moments more decided our fate. A slight  shiver ran through the vessel as she touched the ground, and the rapidly ebbing  tide pressing us every moment more firmly on to the ridge, we remained most  unmistakably hard and fast. Of course, there was no danger &mdash; even the chaperone  could only raise a very small shriek; but fancy our disappointment &mdash; this was  Monday, the regatta was to take place on Wednesday, and as we had gone ashore a  very short time after high-water of a very high spring-tide, it was out of the  question expecting to get the yacht off under a month at least, at which time  we intended to have been on our way to the Mediterranean. Poor Harry&rsquo;s disgust  was intense when the fact was patent to him that the Scud could not sail in the  match, and no wonder he gave vent to an emphatic blessing. However, there was  no help for it, and we went on shore, leaving Donald and the skipper to make  arrangements for getting off the yacht. Of course, everybody condoled with us;  but there was a good deal of chaff about being shipwrecked in a calm.</p>
<p>Half an hour of our landing, Mr. Northcombe came home, after spending  his day in pursuit of mammon in the city of Glasgow; and nothing would satisfy  him but that Harry and I should stay for a week or so at Armadale House; and to  this we agreed, Harry with an eagerness I could not then account for.</p>
<p>The accident to the yacht was a great disappointment to us all, as we  had set our hearts on winning at the regatta; but, to quote Burns&rsquo;s version of  the proverb that appears in some form or other in every known language,</p>
<p align="center">&lsquo;The best-laid schemes o&rsquo; mice an&rsquo;  men <br>
  Gang aft a-gley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And so it was with us.</p>
<p>But to be brief: the regatta took place, and went off in a most  satisfactory manner. The Circe won as she liked, thereby making Polly happy;  but, of course, Harry, Alec, and I said among ourselves that the Scud could  have beaten her, had she been able to sail. As a matter of course, also, a ball  took place afterwards, as that is part and parcel of yacht-racing; and the day  following it was explained how Harry, after all, was not so very much  disappointed at the Scud&rsquo;s going on shore, he thereby receiving old  Northcombe&rsquo;s invitation to stay a little longer in the Frith of Clyde, which he  had accepted with such <em>empressement</em>.</p>
<p>The rooms of the Yacht Club, in which the ball took place, were  admirably adapted for the purpose, there being plenty of card and &lsquo;cooling&rsquo;  rooms en suite, and in one of these, about one A.M., were seated Harry and  Blanche.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Harry dear, I believe it is all fibs your saying that you are glad  that the yacht has gone on shore, and that now you can get off going to the  Mediterranean without any bother; and I&rsquo;m sure you are very savage at not  winning the regatta prize.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, darling, I&rsquo;m not; for I&rsquo;ve won a better prize than all the cups  that ever were sailed for &mdash; and that is you, my Blanche.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Great was the excitement on the banks of Loch Killnoy when the  engagement of Blanche Herbert and Harry Harlowe was announced; but, in spite of  the proverb that &lsquo;the course of true love never runs smooth,&rsquo; all went well in  this case. They are now married, and I am happy to say that Mrs. Harlowe has  neither put a veto on yachting nor insisted on the banishment of Harry&rsquo;s  bachelor friends. The Flying Scud was successfully floated off next spring  tides; and exactly a year from the day she went on shore, she again passed  through the dangerous narrows, carrying nearly the same party as she did on  that eventful occasion; and as we passed the point, that is now marked by a conspicuous  beacon, I said to Harry:</p>
<p>&lsquo;Old fellow, if any one had told you the morning we first entered the  loch that you would leave it a married man, what would you have said?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I should have said <em>then</em>, but I know what I say now &mdash; that it was a &ldquo;happy thought&rdquo;  which first brought me to &ldquo;beautiful Loch Killnoy.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>P.S. &mdash; Blanche&rsquo;s sister has taken pity on me, and we are to be &lsquo;turned  off&rsquo; very soon. We intend to spend our honeymoon in the Frith of Clyde, when  perhaps we may have the pleasure of meeting some of the readers of this paper.  Captain Alec is still a bachelor, and likely to remain so. </p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="ACouchOfHorrors"></a>A Couch  Of Horrors</strong></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know what induced me to cross Bundles Moor on a doubtful  winter&rsquo;s day. I had been stopping for a week at Tickleby Wells among the  Yorkshire moors, recruiting energies exhausted by the completion of my work on  the &lsquo;Infinite Indicative.&rsquo; My engagements necessitated my being in town the  next day. The solitary through train which daily left Tickleby, which is about  two miles from the Wells, started at 5.15 A.M. Perhaps a natural reluctance to  face the chilliness and darkness of early morn had some share in influencing  the decision I arrived at; which was this &mdash; to cross Bundles Moor on foot to  the town of Bungford, where there is a principal station, and whence I could  reach London by a night train in five hours. This plan gave me another day to  inhale the ozone of the hills.</p>
<p>My host the doctor tried to dissuade me. The day was lowering, snow  was in the air, the track was at places faintly traced, here and there it  failed altogether. But I laughed at his cautions. A man who had conquered  virgin peaks of Swiss Alps, who had crossed the Rocky Mountains, who had  mounted the extreme heights of the Andes, scaled the precipices of the  Himalayas, was not likely to be daunted by the dangers of Bundles Moor.</p>
<p>I started; the guests at the Wells, assembled in the portico, watched  my progress up the hill-side. I was soon out of sight of these, and alone among  the undulating moors of West Yorkshire.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding my experience in the Andes and elsewhere, I am bound  to confess that I lost my way; that I wandered many hours in fog and mist and  snow-showers; that I finally was very glad to abandon all hopes of reaching  Bungford, and to crawl warily along the track of a little stream, which at all  events led somewhere. The sulky day was almost quenched in night when I reached  an enclosed country and struck upon a stony lane hedged in by loose stone  walls. On clearing the ridge of the next hill, I saw through a rift in the fog,  lying in the valley beneath me, a little town gray and slaty. Presently I came  to a high-road bordered by a footpath of beaten cinders, and passing one or two  decent houses, sheltered by stag-headed hide-bound trees, found myself in a  street of gray stone cottages, varied here and there by the gateway of some  factory. The only sign of life about the place was the dull reverberation of  machinery, the gush of escaping steam. The town seemed deserted of inhabitants,  but coming to the opening of another street, I was convinced that such was not  the case; for with a great clatter of wooden clogs a human being was advancing.  His dress I can hardly describe, my attention being so much engrossed by his  complexion, which was of a brilliant blue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My friend,&rsquo; I said to him gently, as he approached, &lsquo;can you tell me  if there is an inn in this place?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hay?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Is there an inn here, please?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aw doan&rsquo;t know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there a public-house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A pooblic-house! Now do yo think a tawn loike this &rsquo;ud be without a  pooblic-house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;No, I should think not indeed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What do yo ask such fool&rsquo;s questions for, then?&rsquo; said my friend,  passing on, indignant.</p>
<p>I went on melancholy and forlorn; but again I met a man, whitefaced,  and wearing shoes.</p>
<p>Him I accosted briskly. Perhaps, after all, it was well to be a little  brusque.</p>
<p>&lsquo;My lad, where&rsquo;s public-house?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He stopped and scrutinised me narrowly.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Now, where do you come fro&rsquo; &mdash; London? Nay, you&rsquo;re none come fro&rsquo;  London. You&rsquo;ll be a chap fro&rsquo; a warehouse &lsquo;ee Bradford.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Come, tell us the way to the public-house.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, a don&rsquo;t much matter wi&rsquo; public-houses. Nobbut what a can do with  a good glass a yale now and then.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then you shall have a glass with me if you&rsquo;ll take me to the best inn  in the place.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In this way I succeeded in finding the inn, a dingy square stone  building flush with the road; behind it were extensive outhouses, breweries,  piggeries, and suchlike.</p>
<p>It was like a bit out of <em>Pilgrim&rsquo;s  Progress</em>, my experience in this Yorkshire town.</p>
<p>The landlord gave me no cordial welcome.</p>
<p>What was the name of the place? Well, it seemed very strange as a chap  should come to a place and not know name of it. Nay, there were no more trains  out that night. If I wanted trains, why didn&rsquo;t I go down to the station? Could  I have a bed? Well, he didn&rsquo;t know; they didn&rsquo;t matter much wi&rsquo; letting beds to  folk they knew nowt about. Summut t&rsquo;eat? Nay, he didn&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d aught to  eat; he&rsquo;d ax missus.</p>
<p>Missus came. Ever I have found, whether in African desert or Indian  jungle or American wild, that the kind heart of woman is open to the cry of  distress. But I thought at first that Yorkshire was an exception. Missus was  just as cautious as her master. I was really exhausted and worn out, or I would  have quitted the place at once. At last I happened to mention that I had met at  the Wells a well-known countryman of hers, Mr. Bungs: then she expanded.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Aye! well if ye know Billy Bungs ye&rsquo;re all right. I can give ye a bed  in billiard-room if ye like, I&rsquo;m full in th&rsquo; house. Dinner, my lad! it&rsquo;s  getting supper-time now. I&rsquo;ll get thee a bit o&rsquo; supper, and make thee  comfortable, never fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Really, after the walk I had had, the roaring fire in the inn-parlour  and the comfortable arm-chair were sufficiently pleasant. And the missus&rsquo;s bit  of supper consisted of a hot roast goose, a cold round of beef of about sixty  pounds avoirdupois, a pair of fowls and boiled ham smoking hot, a brace of  grouse, and pies innumerable, backed by a cheese as big as a cart-wheel; and  all put on the table at once.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; you say, &lsquo;I see it now &mdash; hot supper, bad dream, woke with a  start &mdash; regular thing!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wrong again, reader. My experiences of waking life have been thrilling  enough to enable me to dispense with the machinery of dreams. Though, indeed,  had I not irrefragable proofs of the reality of the scene I passed through on  the eventful night of which I am now penning the chronicle, I could wish to  believe it only a troubled dream. You shall hear.</p>
<p>Supper finished, I settled myself in the big arm-chair by the fire,  with the <em>Times</em>, a smoking tumbler of  toddy, and a well-filled pipe, prepared to enjoy myself. I had toiled hard all  day; this evening hour was to be my recompense. But the columns of the <em>Times</em> soon were lost in a mist, the  tumbler smoked untasted by my side, my pipe fell out of my mouth, and I slept.</p>
<p>I was awakened by a knocking at the door. It was the missus.</p>
<p>&lsquo;A&rsquo;m going to lock up now, maister, &mdash; you&rsquo;ll find th&rsquo; ostler up th&rsquo;  yard; he&rsquo;ll show you where your bedroom is, and give you a light.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I stumbled through the darkness up the yard; at an open door, at the  farther end of the yard, stood a man with a light in his hand. He called to me  as I approached,</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! you&rsquo;ve come to take your couch, then, have you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>At the time I was struck with the peculiar nature of his address. My  couch! Fancy a Yorkshireman asking you if you&rsquo;re going to retire to your couch!</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes; give me a candle, please,&rsquo; I said.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ha&rsquo;nt you brought a lamp, then? Well, here&rsquo;s a candle.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He handed me a bit of stick, which had a tallow-dip stuck at the end  of it. Possibly it was the customary chamber-candlestick in Yorkshire &mdash; at any  rate, I was too tired to care. I took it, and entered the open door. The  flickering light of the candle only showed me for a moment a vast black  interior, then the door slammed to behind me, blowing out my candle. I was in  total darkness. Still I had in my pocket a tin box of vesuvians. Without  venturing to move, I felt for this and found it. It is possible to obtain a  flame from a vesuvian if at the moment of ignition, when the phosphorus is  flaring, you apply a piece of paper to it &mdash; still, it&rsquo;s about three to one  against doing it. There were only two vesuvians left in my box &mdash; with each I  failed to light a paper. I turned to the door I had entered &mdash; it was locked.  Still I had been told that my apartment was a billiard-room. I should be likely  to find matches somewhere; probably on the chimneypiece; there are usually a  match-box and a hundred or two loose matches lying on a billiard-room  chimneypiece. The billiard-table must be in the centre of the room; if I could  once grasp that, I could make my way round the room, and my eyes, accustomed to  the darkness, might discern the fireplace.</p>
<p>I took two steps carefully forward, and was precipitated into an  abyss. I don&rsquo;t know how far I fell, consciousness left me for a moment. When I  recovered my senses, I was lying in some yielding matter, unhurt but gradually  sinking. Yes, I was being gradually swallowed up in some horrible viscid pulp.  Although I have breasted the billows of the mighty Atlantic, have sported in  the waters of the arrowy Rhone, yet here all my skill and strength were useless.  I couldn&rsquo;t swim, I couldn&rsquo;t move, except by swinging my arms purposelessly  about; in a few moments they too would be sucked in, and then &mdash; suffocation in  its most horrible form. And yet I couldn&rsquo;t believe it. No, it couldn&rsquo;t be that  this was really my last moment. Well, at least I should know whether my  theories in the Infinite Indicative were just; and yet perhaps not, perhaps  this blackness and gloom creeping over me may be Infinite too! O horror! They  say that in moments of sudden death the whole of a man&rsquo;s past life is revealed  to him as in a panorama. It isn&rsquo;t so, <em>crede  experto</em>; terror, incredulity, a wild wonder, sweep across all the nervous  centres, rendering impressions of consciousness blurred and illegible.</p>
<p>But whilst slowly sinking into this mysterious death, I became aware  of a bright light, as from a lantern, flashing upon me, and that a human form  was peering at me from above. One of the murdering gang who had inveigled me  into this trap, no doubt, and who was here to satisfy himself that the dastardly  deed had been accomplished. The fiend! he was actually prodding at me with an  iron bar! Rage restored my strength for a moment, and I clutched the bar, which  the man had thrust into my breast, with both my hands; the villain,  overbalanced, fell into the pit, the pit prepared for me, and I with all the  energy of despair grasped him, and actually using him as a float, succeeded in  raising myself partly out of the viscid mass. How he roared for help, for more  assassins! and how I, like a madman, crammed great double-handsful of the  sticky stuff we were struggling in &mdash; crammed them into his mouth!</p>
<p>But his cries had done their work; the doors were thrown open, and two  repulsive wretches, carrying stable lanterns, rushed in. </p>
<p align="center">* * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, missus, missus! Coome here, quick! Danged if supervisor han&rsquo;t  tumbled into t&rsquo;couch frame, and here&rsquo;s another&rsquo; (say gent) &lsquo;a-throttling him!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I had indeed found my way into the malt-house instead of into my  bedroom, had tumbled into the malt, and had nearly killed a responsible officer  of her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue.</p>
<p>After we had been fished out, and rubbed down and dried &mdash; my clothes  smell beery to this very day &mdash; my friend the supervisor, who seemed at first to  be strongly inclined to invoke the terrors of the law, and give me into custody  for what he called &lsquo;compressing a couch,&rsquo; began to take a more cheerful view of  the occurrence. He was a Scotchman, and willingly agreed to my proposal to bury  the remembrance of our struggle in an amicable toddy tournament.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Eh, mon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I thocht ye were the divil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;But, I say, what did you want to prod me with that iron thing for?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Prod ye, mon! I was just taking my gauge, that&rsquo;s all. Ye see we gauge  the malt always and all times &mdash; in the cestern, in the couch &mdash; that&rsquo;s the couch  where ye were &mdash; and it&rsquo;s put there to germinate, d&rsquo;ye see; and then it&rsquo;s spread  on the floor, and then roasted in the kiln, and we measure it all ways. But,  mon, I hope I&rsquo;ll never have to gauge sic another couch!&rsquo;</p>
<p>And may I never rest again on such a couch of horrors! </p>

<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="TheBridgeOfStraubing"></a>The  Bridge Of Straubing</strong></h2>
<p align="center"><em>A Legend  of the Danube</em></p>
<p>[In one of the three chapels planted round the churchyard of St.  Peter&rsquo;s Church, outside of the walls of Straubing, a tombstone is pointed out  as that which covers the grave of the unfortunate Agnes Bernauer. Though the  daughter of a humble citizen of Augsburg, this fair damsel, by her beauty and  virtue, gained the heart of Albert, son of Duke Ernest of Bavaria. Albert was  privately married to her; but unfortunately for the happiness of the youthful  couple, their secret reached the ears of the Duke, who had planned for his son  a more exalted match. The father, taking advantage of his son&rsquo;s absence, caused  Agnes to be seized, condemned to death upon false accusation, and cast from the  bridge of Straubing into the Danube. The fury and despair of Albert, on hearing  these horrid tidings, were boundless. He fled away, and in open rebellion  joined the army of Louis the Bearded, his father&rsquo;s bitterest foe, and with him  invaded his native land to take vengeance on the murderers of his wife. The  chronicler adds that this deadly and unnatural feud lasted for many years.] </p>
<p>&lsquo;He told me he&rsquo;d return ere dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me not to fear;<br>
  The dark has come, the stars are out, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Albert is not here.<br>
  Before the casement, where so oft<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We twain have sat, I&rsquo;ll wait,<br>
  And rush to meet him when I hear<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His hand upon the gate.<br>
  How dull and drear the room to-night <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without his cheery smile,<br>
  Uplifting my young heart with joy <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To heaven for a while!<br>
  O sweet half-year of cloudless skies!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O fields and happy flowers!<br>
  O sunny morns! O rosy nights!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O laughter-laden hours!</p>
<p>A step &mdash; he comes! Alas, &rsquo;tis gone;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It passes by the gate &mdash; <br>
  Some weary peasant trudging home <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lie still, poor heart, and wait.<br>
  He told me he&rsquo;d return ere dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me not to fear;<br>
  The dark has come, the stars are out, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Albert is not here.</p>
<p>Why comes he not? I know he seeks <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Duke, his haughty sire &mdash; <br>
Duke Ernest, stern, they say, and proud, <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of fierce and vengeful ire.<br>
But ere he left, he kiss&rsquo;d me thrice <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And strain&rsquo;d me to his breast: <br>
&ldquo;Sweet Agnes, I will tell him all,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we will hope the best;<br>
But, by my knightly faith, I swear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou shalt take thy stand <br>
Before the world my wedded wife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proudest in the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were his words, his last loved words.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is my heart not light?<br>
  Why sits a dread of coming woe <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon my soul to-night?<br>
  He told he&rsquo;d return ere dark,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He told me not to fear;<br>
  The stars are out, the moon is up,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Albert is not here.</p>
<p>He comes, he comes! I hear the gate&rsquo; &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas for human pride,<br>
  Three fierce repulsive men rush&rsquo;d in <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And seized the waiting bride, <br>
  &lsquo;Unhand me! &mdash; Hold! what want you here?<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can it be gold you seek?&rsquo;<br>
  Amazed at such rare loveliness,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those rough men could not speak; <br>
  But each drew back, and silent gazed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On face and ruffled brow:<br>
  Duke Ernest, lord of all the land, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enters the chamber now.</p>
<p>&lsquo;O, where is Albert? Speak, my lord! <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why comes he not to me?&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Peace,&rsquo; said the Duke; &lsquo;that erring knight<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never more shall see.<br>
  &lsquo;Nay, nay, my lord; recall your words!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray God it may not be!<br>
  For I am all the world to him,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he is all to me.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She sank down on a suppliant knee,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So innocent, so sweet;<br>
  She look&rsquo;d up in his frowning face,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She clung about his feet.<br>
  &lsquo;You will not part us, gentle Duke <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;No, no; &rsquo;twere death in life;<br>
  He is my husband leal and true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&rsquo;m his faithful wife.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Duke Ernest forth a casket drew,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A written scroll he bore:<br>
  &lsquo;Now, swear you are not Albert&rsquo;s wife &mdash;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vow ne&rsquo;er to see him more.<br>
  These men shall bear you far away <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Safe to a distant land,<br>
  With dainty robes, and costly gems,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gold at your command.<br>
  Upon these sacred relics swear <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&rsquo;re not his wedded wife;<br>
  But dare refuse &mdash; this scroll condemns, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To-night shall end your life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>She started proudly to her feet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She spake with flashing eye &mdash; <br>
  &lsquo;That I am Albert&rsquo;s wedded wife<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never will deny!<br>
  Though life to me is dear and sweet,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And death a gloomy shore,<br>
  Though life I love &mdash; know you,&rsquo; she said,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I love my honour more.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The old knight clench&rsquo;d his mailed hand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stamp&rsquo;d his foot in scorn:<br>
  &lsquo;Prate you of honour thus, forsooth!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You &mdash; a poor peasant born!<br>
  You are a witch &mdash; by hellish arts <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you beguiled my son.&rsquo;<br>
  &lsquo;Now, by the Holy Cross,&rsquo; said she,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;No witch-deed have I done!<br>
  He sought me for my own poor self,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He show&rsquo;d his love for me;<br>
  He woo&rsquo;d and won my virgin heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then he wedded me &mdash; <br>
  Yes, wedded me! In holy church <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was breathed the mystic vow;<br>
  And though I <em>was</em> a peasant born,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am his equal <em>now!</em>&rsquo;</p>
<p>A coarse curse like an adder hiss&rsquo;d <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From fierce lips parch&rsquo;d and white &mdash; <br>
  &lsquo;The eagle mates not with the crow;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crow shall die to-night.&rsquo;<br>
  He gave a sign his creatures knew, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obeying it full soon,<br>
  For now they drag the young bride forth <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the peering moon.<br>
  Along the dusty road they trail <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her dark dishevell&rsquo;d hair &mdash; <br>
  Would that brave Albert, sword in hand, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could meet those ruffians there!<br>
  They reach old Straubing&rsquo;s fatal bridge;<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, deed of dire disgrace!<br>
  The sad moon hides behind a cloud <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her pale affrighted face.<br>
  The Danube roars, the deep wind wails<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The night-birds loudly scream;<br>
  One long, lorn, terror-laden cry &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&rsquo;ve thrown her in the stream.</p>
<p>The clouds clear off, and silvery beams <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A halo round her throw,<br>
  Illume each stone upon the bridge,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each broken wave below.<br>
  See, see! she breasts the angry flood, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She struggles with the tide;<br>
  She nears the bank &mdash; by all the saints, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&rsquo;ll reach the farther side!<br>
  O, haste thee, haste thee, gallant knight!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And give a helping hand;<br>
  &rsquo;Yea, leap into the swollen stream,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And draw her safe to land.<br>
  He grasps her flowing hair; and now &mdash; <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O God! that there should be <br>
  In all the world so black a heart,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So base a wretch as he! &mdash; <br>
  He holds her head <em>beneath</em> the surge!<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A struggle &mdash; all is o&rsquo;er &mdash; <br>
  And she, so lovely and so true,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is still for evermore.</p>
<p>A great light on the waters fell,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet whispers floated by,<br>
  And melting strains of far-off song <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were wafted from the sky.<br>
  And then a wreath of mist arose <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the spot where Agnes sank; <br>
  Duke Ernest watch&rsquo;d it seek the stars, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then shuddering left the bank.</p>
<p>O Agnes! many a bard has sung <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy beauty and thy bale;<br>
  And many a fair Bavarian maid <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has wept to hear thy tale;<br>
  Wept too for Albert, hapless knight,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who hastening to thy side,<br>
  Met on the bridge thy murder&rsquo;d corse <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just rescued from the tide.</p>
<p>His horror, fury, his despair,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His grief &mdash; ah! who may tell,<br>
  As bending o&rsquo;er the lovely dead <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scalding tear-drops fell?<br>
  He took her cold, cold hand in his,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, with bated breath,<br>
  He swore upon her silent heart <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He would avenge her death.</p>

<p>Long years have past. In Straubing town, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Danube&rsquo;s turbid wave,<br>
  They still show, near its ancient church, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her venerated grave;<br>
  And history tells how civil war <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raged like a roaring flood;<br>
  How son &rsquo;gainst sire waged deadly strife, <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And dyed the land with blood, <br>
  And how the old Duke mourn&rsquo;d his heir <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the ghastly years went by,<br>
  While in his lurid soul was nursed <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worm that would not die. </p>
