</h2>

<p>For two days now an almost continuous stream of traffic had
flowed back and forth along the road. The weather was dry, and dust
thrown up by passing vehicles had settled upon grass and shrubbery.
It penetrated Mrs. Holmes&rsquo;s house and covered its scanty
furnishings with a thin, gray coating; it hung in the air and
choked her. Dust was nothing new to her&mdash;in fact, dust, grime,
disorder were nearly always present in her house&mdash;but now its
taste was irritating and it caused her to revile the sightseers who
had turned this back road into a busy thoroughfare.</p>

<p>All were morbid curiosity-seekers; they were bound to or from
the scene of the Ethridge murder.</p>

<p>Mary Holmes had heard the news of the crime while she was
feeding her geese two mornings before, and had hurried up the road
as fast as she could go. She had been one of the first to reach the
scene of the tragedy, arriving nearly an hour ahead of the
policemen and the newspaper reporters. Inasmuch as she had known
Amos Ethridge quite well and was his nearest neighbor, naturally
she had come in for a good deal of questioning.</p>

<p>She had little to tell, nevertheless it had been an exciting
experience; it had reminded her of old times to answer and to parry
quick, searching questions, while reportorial pencils flew to keep
pace with her words. The reporters had stared at her curiously and
had wanted to know who she was&mdash;all about her, in
fact&mdash;but she had been sly enough to give them no
satisfaction.</p>

<p>She had remained there all day, mingling with the ever-growing
crowd, discussing the case with townspeople whom she knew only by
sight, rubbing shoulders and talking with utter strangers; she had
walked home at dusk with a new feeling of consequence, with her
head higher than usual, and with her heart pounding. As she
prepared her supper she had even ventured cautiously to sing a few
notes&mdash;the first in more than a year.</p>

<p>Anticipation of seeing her name in print once again had affected
her so queerly that she slept little during the night and was up
and waiting agitatedly for the rural delivery-man. But when she had
read the morning papers, when she had seen herself through the eyes
of those reporters, she had been stunned, stupefied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The person living nearest to the scene of the tragedy is
Mary Holmes, a middle-aged, slatternly creature who occupies a
wretched hovel and runs a small chicken ranch at the rear of the
Ethridge estate,&rdquo; the first account ran. Mrs. Holmes had read
on dizzily, &ldquo;She is reputed to be a drunken, irresponsible
character of violent temper and eccentric habits, nevertheless she
shows surprising intelligence and unmistakable signs of education.
She was positive in her statement&mdash;&rdquo; etc.</p>

<p>The other paper had been equally uncomplimentary. It referred to
her as &ldquo;the goose woman&rdquo; and it described her as
&ldquo;a queer, bedraggled, old hag with the stride of an Amazon
and the airs of a queen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Holmes had torn the papers to bits, and later, when
representatives of the afternoon papers came to interview her, she
had refused to talk to them. But the Ethridge case had grown in
importance; the Chicago papers had rushed men to Westland by the
first train and these newcomers were even more inquisitive than the
local news-gatherers. This morning, in self-defense, Mary Holmes
had wired up her gate and nailed a sign to it which read,</p>

<p align="center"><strong>KEEP OFF<br>
REPORTERS TRESPASSING ON THIS PLACE WILL BE SHOT</strong>
</p>

<p>She sat now inside the open window of her front room where she
could watch the automobiles coming and going and hear what the
occupants said when they stopped to stare at her premises or to
read her sign. Evidently the term &ldquo;goose woman&rdquo; had
stuck, for she heard it over and over again. The manner in which it
was used, the laughter and the comment evoked by her warning sign,
were so offensive that she turned for comfort to her gin
bottle.</p>

<p>As to the crime itself, it had created a genuine sensation. The
murder of a man as prominent as Amos Ethridge was bound to prove
front-page news, for he was more than a figure of local importance.
To begin with, he was, or had been, a man of immense
wealth&mdash;the richest man in the whole state&mdash;a political
power, and in all probability the next Governor. Moreover, the
manner of his slaying, the circumstances surrounding it and the
evident ferocity of his assassin, had rendered the crime peculiarly
shocking. He had been shot to death, riddled with seven bullets,
while returning to his home late Thursday night. His body had not
been discovered until the following morning; then it was found
lying in a lane which connected a back road with the rear of his
handsome estate and upon its breast was laid a cross made of two
dead twigs which had been hurriedly tied together. Neither the body
nor its immediate surroundings revealed any clue to the identity of
the slayer; nothing indicated any reason whatever for the crime
unless a letter found in one of Ethridge&rsquo;s pockets was an
indication. This letter, which, by the way, was delicately scented,
had come through the mail and bore the local Westland postmark; the
writing upon the envelope was in a woman&rsquo;s hand, and inside
was a sheet of plain notepaper containing the one word,
&ldquo;Thursday.&rdquo; There was no signature.</p>

<p>Why, in the first place, a bachelor who could come and go at his
will should make use of a narrow, unlighted back road instead of
the broad, macadam thoroughfare which passed his massive front
gates was puzzling; why that cross had been laid upon the body;
why, in fact, anyone should wish to kill Amos Ethridge&mdash;all
were matters of pure conjecture. Questions like these lent mystery
to the affair, and that laconic, perfumed note which might have
been either a warning or an assignation spiced it with a suggestion
of scandal just sufficient to intensify general interest.</p>

<p>Mary Holmes dozed in her rocking chair. She was aroused by the
blare of an automobile horn and by the sound of voices. A car in
which were several men had stopped before her house; one member of
the party had stepped down and was trying to disengage the wire
fastenings of the gate; another, with a press camera over his
shoulder, was getting out. The man at the gate started to climb the
fence, but he was halted midway by a challenge from the house, and
looked up to discover that a tall woman in a faded gingham dress
had emerged upon the porch and was facing him threateningly. She
was a vigorous woman, long-limbed and erect, and she carried her
chin high. In spite of her ill-fitting garments, her flat,
shapeless shoes, and her untidy hair, there was an air of command
about her and an appearance of some consequence. That which caused
the fence climber to freeze into immobility, however, was the sight
of a shotgun in her hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello! You&rsquo;re Mrs. Holmes, I take it,&rdquo; he
began, cheerily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get off that fence!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell her who you are,&rdquo; one of the fellows in the
car directed. The photographer hurriedly opened the clasps of his
camera case.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re newspaper men from Chicago. We&rsquo;ve been
sent down here on the Ethridge case and we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are reporters, you can probably read,&rdquo; Mrs.
Holmes told him. &ldquo;What does that sign say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now see here, this is a big story and it&rsquo;s getting
bigger every hour. You can&rsquo;t shoot us for trying to get the
facts and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;You knew Amos Ethridge, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You heard the shots, Thursday night?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you told the local reporters. Come on,
talk to us. We want to get your picture, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been talking to you and you heard what I
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Mrs. Holmes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You want a picture, do you? Bah! You&rsquo;re all alike.
Vultures! Jackals!&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s voice rose in sudden
anger. &ldquo;You read what these Westland papers said about me,
didn&rsquo;t you? Well, get out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Ethridge used this road a good deal, I understand. At
night, I mean? You probably saw or heard his car that night? All we
want is a brief statement from you.&rdquo; Unobtrusively, the
speaker shifted his weight, lifted himself further over the fence.
&ldquo;We city men have an altogether different theory from
these&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman on the porch cocked her shotgun and raised it, saying,
grimly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall count three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come now! Don&rsquo;t be foolish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One! Two!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go ahead, Jim!&rdquo; urged the camera man. &ldquo;She
can&rsquo;t pull anything like that. If she shoots you, it&rsquo;ll
make a corking picture.&rdquo; The trespasser now had one leg over
the top strand of barbed wire and he steadied himself upon a
post&mdash;neither a graceful position nor one of great stability.
He was about to let himself down inside the yard when Mrs. Holmes
cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Simultaneously she fired. The dry grass and weeds beneath the
teetering figure exploded into a dusty cloud as the charge of bird
shot mowed a path through it. With a yell, the man flung himself
backward, leaving a fragment of his trousers leg upon the fence. He
picked himself up and shook a fist at the woman, shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You damned old harpy! I&rsquo;ll have you arrested for
that! What d&rsquo;you mean, anyhow&mdash;?&rdquo; He paused as he
heard the ominous click of the second barrel, and hurriedly backed
closer to the car. The photographer made haste to follow him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me catch you climbing my fence again. I
keep this gun for hawks, but it will do as well for
buzzards!&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes&rsquo; voice was harsh and strident;
she appeared to tower higher as her rage mounted. &ldquo;Poke fun
at me, will you? Well, you&rsquo;ve got something nasty to write
now, so be as nasty as you can. You want to know who killed Amos
Ethridge, do you? Rats! You don&rsquo;t care who killed him. All
you want is to choke your filthy papers with scandal and lies and
&nbsp;dirt. It&rsquo;s all you can write, all you can think about.
Lies! Dirt!&rdquo; She had quite lost control of herself now and
broke into an incoherent torrent of invective. She checked it only
when the objects of her wrath had slammed the car door and the
machine had rolled away.</p>

<p>When she was alone she strode back into her house and stood the
fowling-piece in its corner, then tramped about the living room,
her head high, her back straight, her deep bosom heaving. So!
They&rsquo;d get a story out of her, would they? Publish her
picture! Use her for a bit of local color, ridicule her, abuse her!
Well, she could give them back as good as they could send in the
line of personal abuse. The scum! The blackguards! She was sorry
they had fled so swiftly&mdash;while her mouth was still so full
and her tongue so bitter. For once in their lives they had heard
something which they would remember. They knew now that she was no
common country lout, no mere &ldquo;goose woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she reflected more calmly upon the encounter she felt some
pride in the way she had carried it off. It had been her scene: she
had held the center of the stage and she had played it
well&mdash;as well as anybody could play such a scene, upon short
notice. After all, only an artist can rise to dramatic heights;
none but the finished actor can portray sincere emotion. She,
&ldquo;a bedraggled old hag!&rdquo; Old, at forty-five! &ldquo;A
drunken, irresponsible character of violent temper!&rdquo; She
wished now that she had shot that reporter in the legs.</p>

<p>The next day, not only the local Westland papers, but also the
big Chicago dailies, carried amusing and highly colored accounts of
that shotgun encounter, and Mrs. Holmes derived a grim enjoyment
from reading them. Again she flared into fury at the
uncomplimentary things they said about her; but indignation is a
fire that quickly burns itself out and it gave her some
satisfaction to read of her victory. This satisfaction increased as
she reread the stories. After a while she experienced an actual
thrill at realizing that she had become a figure of importance in
the biggest news sensation of the day and that people from Maine to
California were reading about her. They saw the name &ldquo;Mary
Holmes.&rdquo; And after twenty years! She wondered if any of them
would remember having seen it before.</p>

<p>The mystery of the murder, by the way, still remained unsolved.
The clues left by the slayer of Amos Ethridge were so slender that
no progress had been made in piecing them together, and, naturally,
theories of various sorts began to be advanced. Several of the
Chicago papers declared that the cross of twigs on the dead
man&rsquo;s breast proved it to be a Ku-Klux outrage, and this
explanation was generally accepted, for Westland was a stronghold
of the Klan and Ethridge was a bitter enemy of the organization.
What is more, an impressive demonstration had recently occurred
here. There had been a parade and a midnight conclave at which
scores of new members had been initiated. Special trains had been
run from distant points, hundreds of automobiles had assembled,
thousands of robed and hooded Klansmen had gathered in the light of
a tremendous fiery cross erected on a hill just outside the city
limits.</p>

<p>Out of this occurrence had sprung a bitter political quarrel,
for Amos Ethridge had boldly proclaimed through the press that the
Governor was an avowed Klansman and that the conclave had been
planned with his knowledge and consent. Ethridge had gone further;
he had charged that the entire machinery of law enforcement was
Ku-Klux in sympathy and that the state had been betrayed, delivered
over to the Invisible Empire. He had promised to adduce irrefutable
evidence, proof positive, when the time came. His accusations had
met with a tremendous popular response and, as a matter of fact, it
was largely as a result of this outspoken support that he had
announced his intention to run for Governor at the coming election,
pledging himself, if successful, to wage relentless war upon the
hooded order and to restore the government to the people.</p>

<p>Threats against his life had followed. He had received Ku-Klux
warnings forecasting much the same end as had actually overtaken
him. His murder upon the very eve of the campaign convinced most
people that the charges voiced by the Chicago newspapers were
indeed sound.</p>

<p>But those charges were not so readily accepted by the citizens
of Westland. Amos Ethridge had been a great man locally and during
his lifetime his power had been such that few of his neighbors
dared speak a word against him, but, now that he was dead, tongues
began to wag. From various quarters there arose a hissing of
scandal. People voiced openly what they had never ventured to more
than whisper&mdash;viz., that Ethridge&rsquo;s private life had not
been above reproach, that there were chapters in it which would not
bear the light of day, and that the authorities would have to look
further than the Ku-Klux in order to find his slayer. What about
that &ldquo;Thursday&rdquo; note that had been found in his pocket?
There was more than one husband or lover, yes, even more than one
father, in Westland who smarted under a sense of outrage and who
had reason to thank God the millionaire was dead. Let the police
discover what woman&rsquo;s fingers had penned that note, then
perhaps the mystery could be solved. It was even whispered that out
of the solving there might result a scandal more painful to the
community than its present sense of loss, and that under the
circumstances it might be the part of wisdom to let sleeping dogs
lie. Such came to be the general feeling in Westland.</p>

<p>As the days crept by and no arrests were made, certain citizens
began to nod and to speak guardedly of &ldquo;influence.&rdquo; The
out-of-town correspondents heard these whispers and promptly wired
them in. As a result a special prosecutor was appointed by the
state and he came on to take charge of the investigation.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening, a week after the crime, Gerald Holmes drove
his new car out the road towards his mother&rsquo;s farm. It was
early, nevertheless it was quite dark. As he crossed the bridge at
the Italian settlement he noticed that his right headlight suddenly
went out, just as it had gone out a week previously at this precise
point. Tonight he did what he had done on that other occasion; he
stopped, got out, and went around to the front of the car to
investigate. Gerald did not pretend to much knowledge of
automobiles, but this coincidence, it seemed to him, proved
precisely what he had told the dealer; to wit, there was a loose
electric connection somewhere and a certain sort of jar destroyed
the contact, dislocated something or other. The dealer had promised
to have it fixed but&mdash;well, this was a sample of his work.
Fine way to turn out a brand-new car, even a cheap one!</p>

<p>Gerald shook the lamp gently, but it appeared to be rigidly
attached to its support and the bulb did not relight. He was afraid
to shake it too hard, for fear of pulling it off&mdash;this was no
rugged, hand-made, foreign car. Then he fingered aimlessly at the
wire beneath the lamp, but that, too, was disappointingly secure.
He reasoned that the wire must run in under the hood of the machine
and somewhere attach itself to a battery or a dynamo or a generator
or something, so he stepped back, lifted the bonnet, and peered
inside. He could make out very little indeed, even with the aid of
a match, and recognized nothing that could by any possibility be
considered a dynamo or an electric lighting plant. The vital organs
of an automobile, it seemed to him, were unnecessarily complicated:
he would have considered many of them utterly useless except for
the fact that here and there &ldquo;things&rdquo; were revolving.
He quickly discovered several wires, any one of which might be the
cause of his trouble, so, striking a second, then a third match, he
gingerly tested them. He had not gone far when he uttered a grunt
and jerked his hand away, incidentally bumping his elbow against
something sharp and hard. Automobiles are full of painful corners.
He dropped the match and swore, whereupon he heard subdued laughter
and through the gloom discovered a couple of figures near by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you fellows know anything about automobiles?&rdquo; he
inquired.</p>

<p>There came an answer in Italian, so he confessed, ruefully:
&ldquo;Well, neither do I. I can drive &rsquo;em, but I can&rsquo;t
fix &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He closed the bonnet, passed back through the glare of his good
headlight, and, stepping into the car, drove on. It was a relief to
note that the car ran as well with one light as with two. Some car!
This little buggy might have her faults, but he loved her, just the
same. It was the first automobile he had ever possessed and his
pride of ownership was inordinate, for it represented a terrible
extravagance. It was a lovely shade of blue, too, the particular
shade he adored, and he would have immensely enjoyed showing it to
his mother. That, however, was impossible. He could never make her
understand. Involuntarily, he fetched a deep sigh and shook his
head.</p>

<p>Instead of proceeding on past the poultry farm and parking his
machine in the grove near the entrance to the Ethridge lane, as he
had done a week previously, he turned in through a break in the
fence before reaching the farm, and killed his motor under a
wide-spreading tree. It was barely possible that the police might
be watching the scene of the tragedy, and in any event it was not a
nice place to be on a dark night. Gerald hated dark colors, dark
nights, dark deeds, and the thought of what had occurred a week ago
tonight in that lane, half a mile ahead, gave him a sick feeling.
He felt jumpy as he set out across the open pasture land towards
the lights of his mother&rsquo;s cottage, and more than once he
cast apprehensive glances back of him or stopped to listen.</p>

<p>Soon the familiar outlines of chicken houses and runs appeared,
then a dog barked. It was Jack, the old Airedale. The dog
recognized Gerald&rsquo;s voice and greeted him with extravagant
affection when the young man dropped down inside the fence. Mrs.
Holmes had heard the disturbance; she opened the kitchen door and
peered out, inquiring guardedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, mother!&rdquo; Gerald entered and closed the door
behind him, then stooped to kiss the woman&rsquo;s upturned lips.
When his face was within a hand&rsquo;s breadth of hers he checked
the movement and cried, reproachfully. &ldquo;Oh,
<em>mother!&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes answered petulantly: &ldquo;Very well! Don&rsquo;t
kiss me if you don&rsquo;t want to. But for Heaven&rsquo;s sake
don&rsquo;t start in with a temperance lecture!&rdquo; There was a
moment of silence, then: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand what it
is to live all alone, in a place like this. <em>You&rsquo;re</em>
never lonesome. You have people to talk to. You see things and hear
things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, mother. I won&rsquo;t lecture. But you know
how I feel about&mdash;drinking.&rdquo; The young man bent his head
and pressed his lips to the woman&rsquo;s cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When did you get back from Chicago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Today. This afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have a good trip?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. They liked my drawings and gave me some more work. I
got a new story to illustrate, too. But&mdash;I was all broken up
over the murder, of course! I left here the next morning, you
remember? I didn&rsquo;t hear of it until that afternoon
&mdash;then just the bare account. Gee! It was a shock. I felt as
if I ought to get on the train and come right back. I wanted to be
here for the funeral, too, but&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t get my money
in time and I didn&rsquo;t dare try to borrow from that
editor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes smiled faintly, almost sneeringly. &ldquo;The
funeral went off all right without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand how I felt towards Mr.
Ethridge. You never liked him, after what he did for me, but I did,
for he gave me my start; made it possible for me to have a career.
Not many rich men would interest themselves in a ragged, obscure,
young&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the son of a &lsquo;goose woman!&rsquo; &rdquo; Mrs.
Holmes broke in. &ldquo;Of course you read the papers and saw what
they called me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald flushed. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, I
read&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rotters! Well, you&rsquo;re not ragged now, are
you?&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes stared at her son, and in her gaze, oddly
enough, there were both pride and resentment. As an artist she
hated Gerald, as a man she&mdash;well, he was her son, blood of her
blood. What she beheld was a handsome youth&mdash;a boy of
sufficient good looks and charm of manner to warm any
mother&rsquo;s heart. Gerald&rsquo;s face was frank and sunny; it
was unusually expressive, too, but curtained with that veil of
conscious repression common to supersensitive people; it was the
eager, dreamy face of an artist, a writer, a musician. The
boy&rsquo;s faults and his weaknesses, Mary Holmes well knew, were
the faults and the weaknesses of most dreamers.</p>

<p>She had never dared to analyze very closely her feelings for
this child of hers&mdash;it is doubtful if she would have succeeded
very well had she tried&mdash;for ever since she had nursed him at
her breast he had roused within her emotions that violently
clashed. There were times when he filled her with a great
satisfaction, a sublime contentment, then again times when she
hated him fiercely&mdash;yes, hated him! There were occasions when
she lavished upon him a sort of savage affection&mdash;these
occasions were rare, by the way&mdash;and again occasions when she
treated him with a cruelty that was positively feline. Nearly
always, however, her feelings were mixed and he excited that
distressing warfare within her bosom. He was at once her comfort
and her torture, her blessing and her bane.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee! It gave me a fright to realize that I hadn&rsquo;t
been gone from here for half an hour&mdash;an hour at
most&mdash;when it happened,&rdquo; Gerald went on. &ldquo;Why, I
might have been involved in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>You?</em> Nonsense! Whoever killed Ethridge drove up
in an automobile and left it standing in that pine grove across
from the lane. I saw the tracks the next morning.&rdquo; Young
Holmes started: he eyed his mother apprehensively. &ldquo;By the
way, you <em>must</em> have met Mr. Ethridge on your way back to
town?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;N-no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have met him. You couldn&rsquo;t have had time
to walk to the end of the street-car line before he came along. It
didn&rsquo;t seem to me you&rsquo;d been gone ten minutes when I
heard his car pass and then the shots. Of course, it was longer
than that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you talked to the police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! They questioned me the morning of the murder
and they&rsquo;ve been here a couple of times since.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you&mdash;tell them about those&mdash;those
automobile tracks? I suppose of course they noticed
them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes nodded. &ldquo;Sure! You couldn&rsquo;t miss
them&mdash;they were as plain as the nose on your face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have they formed any suspicions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dozens, I dare say! But I guess they haven&rsquo;t
made much actual progress. My belief is they don&rsquo;t want to
discover who did the shooting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mean on account of the Ku-Klux&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ku-Klux nothing!&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes exclaimed. &ldquo;The
Ku-Klux didn&rsquo;t kill Amos Ethridge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you so positive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, the circumstances; the evidence; the things I saw on
the spot.&rdquo; The speaker seated herself and began to rock
vigorously. As she bent her mind upon the task of visualizing the
scene of the tragedy, her gaze became preoccupied, her face
changed. Her features were puffed and coarsened by drink, to be
sure, but upon them now was stamped an expression indicative of
more than ordinary mental power; it was as if a lamp had been
lighted behind a dirty, cobwebbed window pane. &ldquo;To begin
with, the number and the location of the bullet holes told a story.
There were seven of them&mdash;he was shot to pieces. She shot him
twice, so close that there were powder burns on his shirt; then she
stood over him and emptied her automatic into his body. It must
have been an automatic, from the number of shots. For that matter,
we picked up the empty shells where they had been ejected. Another
thing, she must have known this back road well, and that lane; she
must have known he&rsquo;d have to get out and open the gate. That
proves she had often been to his house with him, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why would he travel this road at all when the macadam
leads right up to his gates? The papers ask that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;P*olitics! He was in the race for the Governorship and he
had enemies. Probably he knew they were watching him. No candidate
for the highest political office in the state could afford to have
it known that his private life was corrupt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hm-m! Even yet I can&rsquo;t see what makes you so
positive it was a woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as stupid as the police! If there had been
one bullet hole, or even two, it would have indicated a man&rsquo;s
hand. But those other five shots were fired by somebody in a
frenzy&mdash;somebody who was hysterical&mdash;completely out of
his head. Or hers! It was the act of an insanely jealous
woman&mdash;or&mdash;or a man like you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mother!&rdquo;</em> Gerald protested, sharply.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that, even in fun. The mere fact that
a fellow can draw, has an eye for color, is no sign that he&rsquo;s
effeminate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t worry! This is just my own
theory&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty weak, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t intend to tell it to the
detectives. There are a lot of people in Westland who would rather
see Amos Ethridge where he is today than in the Governor&rsquo;s
chair. And I&rsquo;m one of them. Look at that cross over his heart
and that letter in his pocket. D&rsquo;you think a man would have
stopped to make a cross out of twigs and lay it on his breast? No!
More power to the woman, I say. The hand of God directed those
bullets and the hand of God will protect her. If we had more women
like her we&rsquo;d have less unhappiness, fewer ruined lives
and&mdash;and blasted careers. He had the money and the looks to do
anything. He was a whited sepulcher!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He had the money to send me to art school, too,&rdquo;
Gerald countered, with some feeling. &ldquo;And to pay my way for
four years. Just because he saw one of my drawings on a paper
bag&mdash;full of eggs! You never thanked him. You hated him for
it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Thank him?</em> For making an artist out of you?
<em>An artist?</em>&rdquo; Mary Holmes uttered a scornful sound.
&ldquo;You were enough like your father without that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald sighed and shook his head in discouragement. His mother
was indeed difficult&mdash;a queer woman. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not
talk about him or about father,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;What I came
to see you about is the case itself. I&mdash;I wish to Heaven
I&rsquo;d been here, so I could have prevented those wretched
newspapers&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll be called as a
witness next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what if I am called?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why&mdash;<em>think!</em> You must have been hurt by what
they said. If you go on the stand they&rsquo;ll want to know all
about us, past history, everything. The lawyers will dig it out and
the newspapers will make the most of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Maybe they&rsquo;ll treat me differently when they
know who I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald stared at the shapeless figure in the rocking chair for a
moment, then reluctantly he made up his mind to speak as gently as
possible, but as plainly as necessary. &ldquo;Mother, dear, you
don&rsquo;t understand what it would mean, for you can&rsquo;t see
how you&mdash;well, how you have changed! It hurts me to say it,
but I&rsquo;m afraid the papers wouldn&rsquo;t treat you as
sympathetically as you imagine, or as you deserve. It is so much
easier to ridicule than to sympathize or to condone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I see! Meanwhile, you&rsquo;re speaking more for
yourself than for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m speaking for both of us! Can&rsquo;t you
understand that I&rsquo;m having a hard battle to make something
out of myself? Why handicap me more? Westland isn&rsquo;t a large
city&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And of course you couldn&rsquo;t be known as the son of
the &lsquo;goose woman&rsquo;! Your friends would sneer at
you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald defended himself hotly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a cad.
I&rsquo;m not ashamed of our poverty. But I do have some pride,
some decency, and I associate with the best people I can. It shocks
me, it breaks my heart to see you steadily deteriorate. I&rsquo;ve
done what I could to stop it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have you ever done, except preach?&rdquo; Mrs.
Holmes broke out, angrily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <em>never</em> preached! Please, <em>please</em>
don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s quarrel, or at any rate let me say what I
have to say first. You resent my profession because my
talent&mdash;what little I have&mdash;came from my father. You
actually hate me at times, because when I was born your voice went.
As if that were my fault! I can understand that, after a fashion,
but other things I can&rsquo;t understand. For instance, why have
you always tried to strangle whatever there was in me? Oh, you
have! When I used to sing or play, it threw you into a rage and you
whipped me. Why, just think, I might have inherited your musical
talent! When I tried to draw pictures you slapped my hands. Thank
God, Mr. Ethridge saw something in my drawings and encouraged me to
defy you and&mdash;and make something of myself! You yielded
finally because you felt sure I&rsquo;d fail. When I made good you
refused to let me come home; threw me out; said you never wanted to
see me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you&rsquo;re like this I certainly do hate
you,&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes admitted in a voice totally without
feeling. &ldquo;You are your father all over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know! And you blame all this&rdquo;&mdash;with a
comprehensive gesture Gerald indicated the ugly, squalid,
disorderly kitchen&mdash;&ldquo;on him. But I don&rsquo;t. He
isn&rsquo;t to blame. It&rsquo;s the liquor, mother. And the
terrible part of it all is that&mdash;you&rsquo;re getting worse.
Nothing I say seems to have any effect and of course you
don&rsquo;t care what I think. But it makes you mad when the
newspapers say it. Well, they&rsquo;ll say it again, and a lot
more, if you become a witness in this Ethridge case. Your story
will be published from one end of the country to the other. That
would end me&mdash;my career, I mean.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Your</em> career! What do <em>you</em> know about a
career?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not&mdash;not as much as you know, of course. But,
mother, you must have some pride left in that career of yours, in
your name. Surely drink hasn&rsquo;t entirely killed your
self-respect. Even though my feelings and my future are matters of
indifference to you, do you want the whole world to know that you
were deserted by your husband and became a&mdash;well, a drunkard
and a woman of ill repute, as the papers had it? Do you want them
to know that the notorious &lsquo;goose woman&rsquo; in the
Ethridge case is really the once glorious Maria di
Nardi?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The object of this appeal rose and tramped about the room. In
spite of the fact that she was not very sure of her movements, in
spite of her untidy appearance, heightened by the drab, stringy
hair that drooped carelessly upon her neck and forehead and the
slipshod manner in which she wore her garments, there was
nevertheless an air of importance about her and a dignity to her
carriage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! I&rsquo;m a drunkard, a common woman, a low
character&mdash;all those rotten scandal sheets said! And my own
son agrees&mdash;tells me so with his own lips!&rdquo; The
speaker&rsquo;s voice was hoarse with passion, vibrant with
dislike. &ldquo;You dare to say such things to my face! . . . You
want to know what ails me, what has become of my pride, what has
driven me down into the mud and keeps me there. Well, it
isn&rsquo;t the liquor. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
<em>you!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Mother!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I mean it! D&rsquo;you think I drink because I like
the stuff? I drink to kill what&rsquo;s in me here!&rdquo; Mrs.
Holmes clutched fiercely at her bosom. &ldquo;It stupefies me so I
can&rsquo;t think, so I can&rsquo;t remember. I&rsquo;d have died,
otherwise. You took my voice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Again Gerald uttered a cry of protest, but the speaker ran on,
&ldquo;You robbed me of my one great talent, my glory. Yes, I was
glorious! Everybody said so. Kings and queens were at my feet, the
world worshiped me. &lsquo;<em>Career&rsquo;!</em> <em>I</em> had a
career&mdash;but you killed it. <em>You!</em> When you were born
you changed me from a nightingale into a frog. Where would I live
if not in the mud? D&rsquo;you wonder I detest you when I think of
what you did? . . . You&rsquo;re beginning to understand what a
career means and it frightens you to think of losing it.
You&rsquo;re beginning to understand that it means more than money,
more than friends, more than love, more than anything in this whole
world. That it&rsquo;s bigger than all of them. Well, it ought to
make you feel like an assassin, for when you killed my voice you
did more than ruin Mary Holmes, your mother; you murdered Maria di
Nardi, the opera singer, the artist, the greatest contralto in
Europe. In Heaven&rsquo;s name, haven&rsquo;t you done enough,
taken enough, without robbing me of what little comfort is left? A
chicken farmer. Me! A&mdash;a <em>&lsquo;goose
woman&rsquo;!</em>&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes threw back her head and
laughed wildly. &ldquo;What a joke!&rdquo; She sank heavily into
her rocker and swayed her body from side to side. &ldquo;Oh, my
God! What a joke!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald rose and laid a hand upon her drab, uncombed hair. He
could remember dimly, as if in some childhood dream, when that hair
had been shiny and fragrant and almost golden in color and when it
had been proudly worn. That memory left him low in mind and sick in
body. &ldquo;Is it altogether fair to hold me responsible for the
loss of your voice?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes shook off his hand, crying: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t paw
me! &lsquo;Fair&rsquo;? Is anything fair? Has life been fair to
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t have spoken as I did. But
don&rsquo;t misunderstand me. I&rsquo;ve lived long enough to learn
that there are forces outside of ourselves that are too big, too
resistless, to be overcome, so I don&rsquo;t blame you for the way
you feel, mother, for what you&rsquo;ve done or for the dreadful
change that has come over you. I don&rsquo;t even reproach you. I
only pity&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want pity!&rdquo; the woman cried,
furiously. The gin she had drunk earlier in the evening had failed
this time to stupefy; it had merely deadened what was gentle in her
and roused what was savage and hateful. Emotionally she was in
turmoil. The truth of Gerald&rsquo;s accusations had engendered
blind resentment and a fierce impulse to defend herself, to fight
back, to hurt him as he had hurt her. A rat will bite when
crushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had something in mind to tell you the last time I came
out,&rdquo; the boy was saying, &ldquo;but you were in no mood to
listen. I must tell you now, in view of what has happened this
week. I&rsquo;ve been working hard and getting ahead slowly. It
won&rsquo;t be long, I hope, until I can make a home for both of
us&mdash;for all three of us. I&rsquo;m going to&mdash;get
married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Holmes stared at him dully. Here was another shock&mdash;to
think of Jerry as no longer a boy, but as a man old enough to
consider marrying. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get married. Who&rsquo;d
marry you, the &lsquo;goose woman&rsquo;s&rsquo; son?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m getting at. I don&rsquo;t
propose to be known as the &lsquo;goose woman&rsquo;s&rsquo; son. I
propose to take you out of this if you&rsquo;ll let me. I propose
to have you come and live with us and leave all this behind,
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve picked out the girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald nodded. He flushed, and his sensitive, eager face was
slowly illuminated, glorified, by an expression his mother had
never seen it wear. It was an expression, by the way, that caused
the years to roll back and remembrance to smite her. He was, for
the moment, the living image of his father, and the likeness almost
wrenched a cry from her lips. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s very beautiful,
mother, very talented and very fine.&rdquo; The boy&rsquo;s eyes
were fixed and shining; a breathless, reverent quality had crept
into his voice, and it was plain that when he mentioned this girl
his soul bowed in worship and his heart paid homage. &ldquo;She is
infinitely superior to me, of course. That&rsquo;s what makes it so
wonderful, so incomprehensible. I want you to&mdash;well, to make
yourself over into what you were so that she can meet you and know
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. Mrs. Holmes broke it by
exclaiming harshly, &ldquo;Forget it!&rdquo; Gerald had hurt her
bitterly tonight. He had rubbed salt into her wounds. She had
fallen low; she had become ugly and old and contemptible, had she?
Instead of sympathy he gave her a sort of supercilious pity and
implied that she was unfit to meet his sweetheart until she
regenerated herself. Instead of sharing her sorrow he went out and
made his own life, made for himself a career such as he had robbed
her of. The injustice of it! Well, this would be their hour of
reckoning, the hour when she would compel him to take up and share
the burden that had bowed her shoulders. Those alcoholic demons in
the back of her head were dancing dizzily and it gave her a
prodigious, wicked satisfaction to realize that she had the power
now to humble his spirit as he had humbled hers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Forget it, Jerry,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t get a girl like that to marry you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can if we stop right here, mother, and if you&rsquo;ll
let me help you&mdash;er, get back on your feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have you&mdash;not the kind of a girl
you&rsquo;ve been talking about.&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes giggled
malevolently. &ldquo;You see, my boy, you haven&rsquo;t any name to
give her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much of a name, of course, but I&rsquo;ll make one.
I&rsquo;ll make it something to be proud of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes rose, walked to the cupboard, opened its door, and
took out a thick drinking glass and a square-faced bottle. Slowly
she poured the tumbler half full of gin, then drank it; her eyes as
they met those of her son were hostile, there was malignity in her
gaze. It was an act of deliberate, calculated defiance, for never
before had she taken liquor in his presence. Gerald looked on
incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand English,&rdquo; she said,
harshly. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re old enough to run around with women
and think about getting married, I guess you&rsquo;re old enough to
stand some plain talk. You give me enough, God knows! A little of
your own medicine won&rsquo;t hurt you. What I mean to say is
this&mdash;your father and I were never married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald gasped; his face whitened; a look of fright, of abject
misery, crept over it. &ldquo;I&mdash;should have known better than
to talk to you when you&rsquo;ve&mdash;when you&rsquo;re like
this,&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not serious,
mother!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes I am! I mean exactly what I say. You&rsquo;re
forever telling me unpleasant things about myself; now I&rsquo;ll
tell you some. I&rsquo;ll have to go back and explain, so
you&rsquo;ll understand. . . . Opera singers, in my time, were
about what they are now, and the profession was about the same. A
girl had to exercise every means at her disposal to get to the top.
It was the price. Success in any art must be paid for; every great
artist has to make some sort of sacrifice. I made mine, but the
reward was worth it. It was worth any price. Art is so much bigger,
so much more important than other things&mdash;everything else is
so small, so trivial, so false and so fleeting. I was young, I had
sex appeal, and I had a voice. I used them all to get ahead. I had
temperament, too. I lived every role I played: I put vitality and
fire into them. When I was on the stage they used to say I was a
flaming genius. Flaming!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes tramped about the room as she talked; beneath her
feet the bare floor boards creaked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve told you how my big success came abroad. You
know all that and how I was anticipating the day when I could come
home and achieve my supreme triumph, here in America. How I met
your father&mdash;in Paris. It wasn&rsquo;t his first affair, nor
mine, but it was the first time I had ever been genuinely, madly in
love. I didn&rsquo;t know I had it in me. I was a perfect fool.
Most women are, by the way, at one time or another. He hadn&rsquo;t
a thing&mdash;money, I mean&mdash;so I gave him what I had earned
and what had been given to me. I showered him with gifts, spoiled
him, turned his head. He took it all and we lived wildly,
extravagantly, drunk with each other&rsquo;s love. That temperament
again!</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it had begun to pall on him even before we
learned that you were coming, but he didn&rsquo;t show it. When we
discovered that I was going to have a baby I suppose we talked
about marriage&mdash;people usually do. Probably that helped to
spoil things. Perfect love, perfect romance, was one thing;
marriage, squalling children, milk bottles, dirty dishes&mdash;that
was another. He was an artist. You came between us even before you
were born.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t bear to see the change in me. My
appearance got more and more on his nerves. He quit
finally&mdash;went away. That was a terrible shock to me; it was
enough to kill most of the affection I might have felt for you. Oh,
I know it sounds unnatural, incredible! That&rsquo;s because you
can&rsquo;t understand how some people are constituted.
You&rsquo;re full of story-book sentiment; this was real life.
Neither of us was domestic. You won&rsquo;t understand, either,
when I tell you that his desertion wouldn&rsquo;t have left any
serious results on me; they said, as a matter of fact, that it
would make me even a great artist&mdash;having suffered. But at
least you can understand how it turned me back to my work with a
more passionate devotion than ever, since it was all I had left,
all that was real and substantial and satisfying. My voice had
never been so splendid as it was during that period. My friends
told me that a miracle had occurred and that I possessed the most
beautiful voice in the world. They worshiped it. They, and I,
blessed you as the cause of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you were born. . . Again Mrs. Holmes turned her eyes
upon her son, and now they were brilliant, feverish; her face was
working. &ldquo;You know what happened! For a while, the doctors
encouraged me to believe that my voice would come back. That was to
keep me from killing myself. But it didn&rsquo;t come back. It was
gone, lost to the world! There were artists in the company who
would have strangled you, gladly, and hung for it, if it would have
brought back Mary Holmes&rsquo;s voice. That&rsquo;s how much they
thought of it. That&rsquo;s what a truly great voice means.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You wonder why I&rsquo;ve never been a real mother to
you. God! You&rsquo;ve been a living reproach to me; every day of
your life you have tortured me, stuck knives in me. As if that
weren&rsquo;t enough, you&rsquo;ve grown into the very image of
your father&mdash;you&rsquo;re like him, inside and out. I suppose
this girl feels towards you the way I felt towards him&mdash;so far
as she&rsquo;s capable. But I&rsquo;ll bet she won&rsquo;t marry
you. Not now she won&rsquo;t.&rdquo; For a second time the speaker
giggled.</p>

<p>Gerald flinched at the sound, but he did not raise his head.
&ldquo;It seems to give you an unholy satisfaction,&rdquo; he said,
wretchedly. &ldquo;I wonder why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo; <em>&lsquo;Why&rsquo;?</em> Why not?&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes
allowed a hiccough to escape her lips. &ldquo;Turn about is fair
play, isn&rsquo;t it? Maybe you&rsquo;ll shed some of your fine
airs, now. Maybe you&rsquo;ll quit nagging me, quit this
&lsquo;holier-than-thou&rsquo; business. Why shouldn&rsquo;t you
help me carry my load? . . . Well, why don&rsquo;t you answer? What
have you got to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much&rdquo;&mdash;Gerald rose wearily and took his
hat&mdash;&ldquo;except to curse the day you tasted liquor for the
first time. If you were in your right senses you would never have
told me this. You wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t take such
devilish joy in causing me pain. You would have carried this secret
to your grave. I dare say you expect sympathy, but what about me,
the fellow who has always cherished an old-fashioned reverence for
motherhood and who believes in pure women and such things? You
mentioned the hand of God, a while ago. The hand of God is on you,
mother; it&rsquo;s on both of us. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid it will
destroy us both.&rdquo; Without another word Gerald walked to the
door, opened it, and stumbled out into the night.</p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>2</strong>
</h2>

<p>The time was when Westland had been a first-class theatrical
town and most of the good road shows had played it. But conditions
had changed. Chicago was only a few hours away, picture palaces had
been built, and now the old West Theater, the city&rsquo;s leading
playhouse, ran a stock company. It was a good stock company,
however; Amos Ethridge, the owner of the property, had prided
himself upon being a patron of the drama and he had seen to that;
in consequence a number of well-known artists were usually featured
upon the West&rsquo;s billing. This season the most popular, if not
actually the most prominent, member of the Ethridge players was
Hazel Woods, the youthful leading woman. Mr. Ethridge had hired her
out of a New York dramatic success and Westland considered itself
fortunate in having a real Broadway favorite to worship.</p>

<p>Stock engagements in small cities like Westland are often both
profitable and pleasant, for salaries are good, the players form
new friendships, they enjoy an agreeable social life, and receive
numerous courtesies and advantages not infrequently denied them in
larger cities. In Miss Wood&rsquo;s case, for instance, Ethridge
had put a charming little house at her disposal, rent free, there
being no really first-class residential hotel in Westland; and
there she reveled in the unfamiliar joys of housekeeping and
entertained as much as her arduous duties permitted. Being a very
pretty, very sprightly young woman, she had quickly made herself
popular.</p>

<p>Through Amos Ethridge she had met Gerald Holmes. She and Gerald
were about the same age, but in experience he was much younger than
she, and this fact, perhaps, as much as his shyness, his modesty,
and his undeniable genius had engendered in her a desire to
&ldquo;mother&rdquo; him and to help him along. Some men awaken in
women an impulse to hover them, and Jerry was one. But not many
emotional young women with abundant personal charm can successfully
maintain a maternal attitude towards an attractive and magnetic
young fellow, no matter how humble and how reverent may be his
regard at the beginning. There was only one possible outcome to
this affair. Gerald fell head over heels in love and, having
nothing, he magnificently offered to share it all with her. Hazel
had astonished him by accepting. Eagerly, and yet with caution, she
became engaged to him; she promised to marry him&mdash;some
time.</p>

<p>Tonight as Gerald parked his car near the stage entrance of the
theater a few minutes after eleven he experienced his first genuine
regret at having permitted himself to fall in love. What his mother
had so brutally told him an hour before left him dismayed, sick.
All the way in from her farm he had asked himself whether he should
tell Hazel and risk&mdash;nay invite her to break the engagement,
or whether he should deceive her. His duty seemed plain, but the
mere possibility of losing her was unbearable. He was in
turmoil.</p>

<p>Members of the cast and some of the stage hands were leaving as
he entered the stage door and spoke to Jacob Riggs, the doorman. He
and Jacob were great friends and the old fellow welcomed him with a
smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s dressing, but she&rsquo;ll be out in a few
minutes,&rdquo; the latter announced. &ldquo;Have a good time in
Chicago?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly a &lsquo;good time,&rsquo; &rdquo; Gerald
said, with an effort to speak naturally. &ldquo;I was too much
upset by the news of Mr. Ethridge&rsquo;s death. It must have been
a terrible shock to Miss Woods and to all of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah!&rdquo; Jacob nodded. &ldquo;It caused quite a stir
all over town. &lsquo;All Judah did Hezekiah honor at his
death.&rsquo; D&rsquo;you think they&rsquo;ll ever find out who
done it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope so. I can&rsquo;t bear to think&mdash;you see, he
did a great deal for me. He was a real friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He treated me all right, too, but&mdash;&rdquo; Jacob
shook his white head. &ldquo;A lot of things about him we
don&rsquo;t know, Jerry. A lot nobody knows. The Lord works in a
mysterious way and the wicked is doomed to destruction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here, Gerald realized, was the Westland attitude of mind. He
resented it, but at this moment he was in no mood to argue the
matter, so he turned away. Argument, he knew, affected old Jacob
disagreeably; it provoked him and excited more strongly his
fanatical religious ideas and prejudices.</p>

<p>This Jacob Riggs, by the way, was a character. If a man may be
said to smell of the theater, he did, for he had been born and
reared back stage, and it was his boast that the only crib he had
ever known was the top till of a Taylor trunk. The traditions of
the profession were real to him, its stars were actual
stars&mdash;faultless, effulgent creatures that soared through an
atmosphere reserved exclusively for heavenly bodies. Their art and
their persons were sacred; defects they had none. His world
revolved about the West Theater and its center was the stage door
where he held sway&mdash;that is to say, his material world. He
dwelt also in a spiritual world, a world of distorted biblical
quotations. An unusual type of doorman was Jacob. The stage crew,
mindful of the fact that he had been a second-rate singing and
dancing comedian in his prime, irreverently referred to him as
&ldquo;the song-and-dance saint.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were times, however, when Jacob proved himself to be
anything except saintly, for he had a frayed and ragged temper and
he took enormous, if sometimes ill-founded, dislikes to people. On
the other hand, his likes were equally decided and he had odd ways
of showing them. He had taken a tremendous fancy to Hazel Woods,
for instance, and, as he put it, he had adopted himself as her
&ldquo;guardeen.&rdquo; The first she had known about it was when
he moved his belongings into the vacant room over her garage and
without consulting her in the least announced his intention of
establishing himself as a permanent addition to her household.
Argument, protest, had failed to budge him. There he stayed. He
dismissed the caretaker employed by the actual owner of the
premises, and himself cut the grass, attended the flowers, and
generally took charge of things for Hazel.</p>

<p>Gerald had not waited long when he heard the rustle of a figure
approaching and Hazel came running towards him with her hands
outstretched.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad!
You&rsquo;ve been gone for <em>ages!</em> Let me look at
you.&rdquo; She faced him towards the light. &ldquo;Why, you
look&mdash;dreadful! What is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing! I&mdash;it has been a trying week.&rdquo; He
tried to smile, but his face felt stiff. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sure
whether you&rsquo;d want to see me&mdash;&rdquo; He answered her
startled, inquiring glance by saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all so new!
I&rsquo;m not used to it yet. And then, too, those newspaper
stories about my mother&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; Miss Woods slipped a gloved hand into the
crook of his arm and snuggled her shoulder intimately against his.
&ldquo;Is that all? Well, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re back.
I&rsquo;ve a thousand things to talk about. Come along. We&rsquo;re
going home and we&rsquo;ll have a bite to eat there. Where&rsquo;s
the little blue oil stove?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s outside at the curb.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want to ride home with us, Jacob?&rdquo; Hazel inquired
of the doorman. &ldquo;Jerry&rsquo;s fireless cooker will carry
four.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old fellow grinned and shook his head. &ldquo;I gotta lock
up. I&rsquo;ll be along later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Think of you driving an actress home in your own
car!&rdquo; the girl ran on as she and Gerald left the theater.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel rich and wicked?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not as rich as I did before I paid my garage bill.
I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to call this car my
&lsquo;blunderbus.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You&rsquo;re going to make lots of
money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Gerald helped the speaker into her seat he could not resist
planting a hasty kiss upon her cheek. &ldquo;Oh, careful!&rdquo;
Hazel cast an apprehensive look over her shoulder, but at the same
time she clutched his arm in a way that thrilled him. After a while
she said: &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t write me, once! I&rsquo;d like to
know how you are going to explain that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald answered, seriously: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I had in
mind back yonder. Our engagement doesn&rsquo;t seem real.
It&rsquo;s like a dream. I wondered if you really meant it; if you
actually cared for me. Then, too, those wretched newspapers! I told
myself you might change your mind&mdash;&rdquo; He heard an
incoherent but eloquent and thoroughly satisfying exclamation from
the girl at his side. She drew closer and the sensation of her body
actually against his rendered him dizzy. It was quite a task to
drive; it required stern determination to keep both hands on the
steering wheel.</p>

<p>Even during these few moments Gerald had become aware of some
subtle change in his fianc&eacute;e. She had never welcomed him,
even before old Jacob, with such unconcealed affection as tonight.
He had courted her at little parties, over restaurant tables, on
the street or in public places when other people were close by, and
he had never actually had her to himself for more than a moment or
two; but tonight he was taking her home. For supper! He knew that
the one maid she kept &ldquo;slept out,&rdquo; and hence for once
he could anticipate a real lovers&rsquo;
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, free from interruption. The
prospect was enough to render him careless of traffic rules.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that Hazel had never appeared so lovely as when
she snapped on the lights in her hall, dropped her light wrap, and
turned to him with shining eyes. Her lips were parted, her face was
eager; she held out her bare arms. It was a joyous, impulsive
gesture of surrender; her look, her attitude, was one of complete
abandon. She melted into his embrace, warm, fragrant, throbbing;
her lips clung to his and he could feel her tremble in response to
his ardor.</p>

<p>After a while the girl withdrew herself, then, flushed and
smiling mistily, she disappeared into the dining room. Gerald
slowly filled his lungs. He came out of his ecstacy when he heard
her in the pantry, and he followed, volunteering to lend her a
helping hand. But she laughingly refused his aid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. You must sit down and tell me all about your trip,
and how the editors liked your drawings, and what they said, and
what you thought about me, and that I&rsquo;m an adorable actress
and the most beautiful creature in the world and that you love me
wildly, insanely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was an order easily filled to the very letter. While the
girl came and went, Gerald talked, answered her breathless
interruptions, interrupted her. He watched her with adoring eyes.
When she passed his chair he detained her long enough for a caress,
and when she finally succeeded, despite his interference, in
setting the table, he drew two chairs up side by side.</p>

<p>Probably they ate something, but neither of them could have told
what it was.</p>

<p>Hazel was indeed a different girl from what she had ever been
before. During his absence her love, it appeared, had suddenly
burst from the bud into full bloom. The miracle would have made
Jerry completely happy except for that hideous thing in the back of
his mind. He tried his best not to think of it, but it would not be
ignored; the more openly in word and deed this girl confessed her
love, the more his secret distressed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you, dear?&rdquo; she asked him finally.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in trouble of some sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hesitated, then he broke out: &ldquo;Yes, I am&mdash;
frightful trouble!&rdquo; Instantly Hazel&rsquo;s hand closed over
his, concern leaped into her eyes; her tone changed as she urged
him to tell her what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose I must tell you, but&mdash;it&rsquo;s like
cutting my own throat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, <em>Jerry!</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swore I wouldn&rsquo;t, couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;and all
the time I knew I&rsquo;d have to. Tonight, of all nights!&rdquo;
He shook his head and groaned.</p>

<p>The girl eyed him in growing alarm. She had become quite pale
when she inquired: &ldquo;Is it something about&mdash;us? You
don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;marry me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing like that. I haven&rsquo;t done anything,
either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it can&rsquo;t matter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! I drove out to see my mother this evening about the
Ethridge case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; Hazel cried, sharply.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about that. I
can&rsquo;t bear to&mdash;to hear it mentioned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to talk about it. You see, I knew how she
must feel about the way those reporters had treated her, and I was
afraid it would set her to drinking again&mdash;afraid she might
say something or do something to make matters worse. You&rsquo;ve
been awfully sweet about her, Hazel. Not one girl in a million
would have been so charitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t the only woman in the theatrical
profession who has fallen on hard times and&mdash;gone back. You
shouldn&rsquo;t feel so ashamed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know her. I never knew her until tonight.
. . . I&rsquo;ve had a pretty bitter, pretty unhappy experience for
a young fellow. I was convinced that she had talked or would talk
so much that they&rsquo;d call her for a witness, put her on the
stand&mdash;Well, that would mean the whole wretched story,
understand? Publicity! Gossip! Scandal! Lord knows! it&rsquo;s
going to be hard enough for me to face what has already come out.
If it weren&rsquo;t for you I think I&rsquo;d run away from
Westland. . . . I found that she had been drinking. We always
quarrel when she&rsquo;s like that. She misconstrues everything I
say, resents everything I do; something devilish and cruel comes
out in her. I suppose she must have some maternal affection for me,
somewhere, but she succeeds in concealing it mighty well. It was
the same as usual tonight. We had a terrible row. She broke out
finally and told me how she hated me and why: told me why she has
always stood in my way and tried to strangle whatever talent I had.
Oh, it was&mdash;hideous. . . . You&rsquo;re the only person to
whom I shall ever reveal what she told me: I&rsquo;ve <em>got</em>
to tell you, no matter what the consequences.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald repeated in a few short sentences the story he had heard
from his mother&rsquo;s lips. It was not a pretty story; he made no
effort to soften it. &ldquo;Imagine hearing a thing like that
from&mdash;your mother! I try to tell myself it&rsquo;s a
nightmare; that she didn&rsquo;t say anything of the sort or that
she was lying. But she wasn&rsquo;t lying. Worst of all, she
confessed casually, without the slightest feeling, that she had
been&mdash;bad! That&rsquo;s the hardest to bear. She was a bad, a
guilty woman! I&mdash;don&rsquo;t feel as if I could ever look
anybody in the eyes again.&rdquo; He dropped his head into his
hands.</p>

<p>Hazel rose and crossed the room to a window. She stood there
staring out into the blackness for some time. Jerry raised eyes,
bleak with suffering, dark with apprehension; after a while he got
heavily to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t blame you,&rdquo; he said, huskily.
&ldquo;She said no nice girl would marry me. I dare say no nice
girl <em>could</em> marry me. I feel like a criminal to hurt you,
but&mdash;I was desperate, I snatched at an hour of happiness.
I&mdash;&rdquo; He choked, then he made blindly for the hall.</p>

<p>Hazel turned, ran after him, drew him back to the couch upon
which they had been sitting. &ldquo;You poor boy!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. When she tenderly put her arms about him a wave of
relief swept over him; he completely lost control of himself and
gave way to his grief. He hid his face upon her shoulder. Like a
mother she comforted him. &ldquo;Nothing is going to make any
difference with me, so long as you love me. She told you that no
nice girl would have you and you believed her, did you? You
foolish, sensitive Jerry! As if you were responsible for her sins!
For that matter, I&rsquo;m not a &lsquo;nice&rsquo; girl; I&rsquo;m
a wicked actress.&rdquo; The speaker actually laughed, as if in
relief.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s more than a disgrace. I
haven&rsquo;t any name to offer you,&rdquo; Jerry&rsquo;s words
were tremulous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sh-h! Is it your fault that you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;love
child&rsquo;? Why, my dear, that&rsquo;s where your genius comes
from and I adore your genius as much as I adore you. Nothing can
shame that. You&rsquo;re going to be a great artist&mdash;oh, I
know it!&mdash;and I can help you; I can make you become great. No
man ever succeeded or failed very greatly, ever became very good or
very bad, without a woman to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry clutched the girl fiercely and she took delight in the
pain of his embrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought I&rsquo;d be shocked,&rdquo; she went on,
after a moment, &ldquo;but it takes more than&mdash;well, it takes
something pretty dreadful to shock a girl who has lived the way
I&rsquo;ve had to live. There&rsquo;s one thing the theater
teaches&mdash;that&rsquo;s charity. Your mother, whatever she is
now, was a brilliant artist in her time and we must remember that.
In the theater that counts for a great deal. There are people
endowed with such blazing genius that ordinary ties and ordinary
conventions don&rsquo;t, can&rsquo;t bind them. The fire of it
burns away their bonds. Yes, and how can you judge right and wrong?
They&rsquo;re such words. Circumstances are so powerful. She told
you what price girls sometimes have to pay for
success&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You angel!&rdquo; breathed the boy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
only good, clean women like you who can be truly
charitable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! We&rsquo;re all pretty much alike. Only some of
us are differently placed. What we actually do is of so little
consequence as against what we are&mdash;or what we become. She had
no right to stand in your way, of course; that was wicked and
cruel; it was hideous of her to tell you this thing; but&mdash;how
many geniuses are quite normal? Any great talent throws the scales
off balance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald had somewhat recovered himself by now. Gently he kissed
Hazel full upon the lips; quietly, reverently, but with a throbbing
earnestness he said: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the truest, sweetest woman
I have ever known and you&rsquo;ve brought back all my faith, all
my courage, all my self-respect; you&rsquo;ve made a man of me. If
you can think charitably of my mother, then surely I can. Yes,
you&rsquo;ve done a wonderful thing, for you&rsquo;ve made me more
ashamed of myself than of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was late when the lovers managed to tear themselves apart and
to exchange the last kiss. For some time after Jerry had gone Hazel
stood where he had left her, gazing meditatively at nothing and
with the faintest pucker between her brows. She pulled herself
together when she heard a sound in the adjoining room, and
inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Jacob?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yeah! I been waiting till Jerry went home. I wanted to
talk to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hazel returned to the dining room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty
late&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know but&mdash;there was a couple of fellahs at the
theater after you left. A couple&mdash;detectives.</p>

<p>Miss Woods turned startled eyes upon the speaker.
&ldquo;Detectives? W-what for? What about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Ethridge case, of course. They asked a lot of
questions: how often was he used to coming here; did he ever come
after the show, when you was alone; was you ever out to his place,
what kind of friends was you and him? All that kind of
stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. And what did you tell them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told &rsquo;em what the Book says: &lsquo;The wicked
man shall fall by his own wickedness. He shall be snared in the
work of his hands. Amos Ethridge was an abomination unto the Lord
and the Lord slew him with the edge of the sword.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But surely that didn&rsquo;t answer their questions,
Jacob.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! I told &rsquo;em he came and went here, like a lot of
others&mdash;him owning the theater like he did&mdash;and you went
out to his place once in a while when he was giving a party or
something. About him being here that Thursday
night&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They asked about that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They were awful particular about the night he was killed.
I said if he&rsquo;d been here I&rsquo;d of seen him, sure, and I
didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t see his automobile standing outside,
either. I swore positive to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, then Miss Woods murmured with an
effort: &ldquo;No doubt they are questioning everybody. I knew Mr.
Ethridge well; he was very kind to me. He treated all of the
company well, for that matter. Why should I wish to&mdash;to injure
him? Or anybody?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure thing! That&rsquo;s what I told &rsquo;em. Folks
have to have a reason for killing folks. You&rsquo;re just a sweet,
innocent kid. Iniquity ain&rsquo;t in the innocent and nobody
taketh reward against &rsquo;em. They showed me the letter that was
found on Mr. Ethridge and wanted to know if it was your
writing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; The inquiry came faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I lied about that, too! I said it
wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; Miss Wood&rsquo;s knees weakened and she sat
down. Her eyes were wide and frightened; they were fixed
hypnotically upon Jacob&rsquo;s. The old man regarded her kindly,
then said: &ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t you worry. Nothing&rsquo;s going
to happen. You go to bed. Jacob won&rsquo;t let nobody hurt
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the morning after Jerry&rsquo;s visit, Mary Holmes ran
through a stack of newspapers and discovered, to her surprise and
to her chagrin, that nowhere was her name mentioned. The Ethridge
case was featured as prominently as ever, but she had dropped out
of it. In one week she had emerged from obscurity, had become a
national character, and had been forgotten; it seemed almost as if
she had been born, had lived feverishly, and had died, all in seven
days. She did not enjoy the sensation; she was offended. The taste
for publicity is like the taste for narcotics: it feeds upon
itself, and, once formed, it is hard to break. For awhile Mary
Holmes had walked in the spotlight; now to be elbowed aside, to be
crowded entirely off the stage, caused her to boil with rebellion.
Her vanity had been hurt by the first newspaper stories, it is
true, but with a little imagination and some gin she had been able
to ignore their mockery and to construe what remained as applause:
it took some effort to picture herself as the old Mary Holmes
beneath whose feet once more were the rapt, upturned faces of the
world, but after a fashion she had succeeded. It was a sort of game
and she had enjoyed playing it. To be robbed now of that enjoyment
left a bleak feeling of emptiness, a feeling which increased when
she dimly recalled her scene with Jerry on the previous evening. So
he was going to get married&nbsp; That would leave her more alone
than ever. She was sorry she had told him the truth about himself;
he was such a sensitive flower! He would probably stay away
altogether, and his visits had at least broken the deadly humdrum
of this wretched existence. Any interruption, anything whatever to
do or to think about, was preferable to monotony such as she
endured. She realized this morning that those visits had meant more
than she had imagined. Heigh-ho! About all the excitement she could
look forward to from now on was being called as a witness in the
Ethridge case and getting back into the newspaper columns in that
manner. But there was no certainty that she would be called. Her
love of the dramatic made her wish that she had a really
sensational story to tell. It would be thrilling to take the stand
and give testimony that would electrify the court, the whole
country. There would be some fun in that and&mdash;</p>

<p>Her mind envisaged a new thought and she considered it while
feeding her poultry. When she had finished her work she walked up
the road and spent a long while studying the scene of the tragedy
and carefully exploring the ground. When she returned there was a
deep frown of preoccupation upon her face, but her eyes were bright
and there was a purposeful set to her features.</p>

<p>Later that day she assured herself that some destiny must have
shaped her thoughts, for Mr. Vogel, the new prosecutor, drove out
from town and interviewed her. With him he brought Westland&rsquo;s
chief of detectives, Lopez. For a while Vogel questioned Mrs.
Holmes perfunctorily; then his bearing changed; he became alert,
attentive.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you make all this known before?&rdquo;
he inquired. &ldquo;The police talked with you and so did the
newspaper men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the woman laughed harshly. &ldquo;They talked
with me; and then they went out of their way to make me ridiculous.
The idiots! The swine! Why should I tell them anything? Come here,
I want to show you something.&rdquo; She led her callers out of her
living room and into a squalid bedchamber adjoining. The bedclothes
had been slept in repeatedly and had not been made up; the room was
indescribably dirty, its windows were unwashed. It was precisely
the sort of den in which a woman like Mary Holmes would sleep. Too
bad she was not a credible witness, Vogel thought. If she were
anything except what she was he could put some confidence in her,
make use of her, but&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down.&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes cleared two rickety chairs
of their burdens of old clothes, dusty newspapers, and what not,
then from a dark corner she dragged forth a rusty trunk. The lid of
this she flung back: it was partially filled with old scrapbooks,
programs, lithographs, photographs, and the like. She rose with her
arms full and dumped her burden upon the bed, then thrust a huge
volume into Vogel&rsquo;s hands. &ldquo;Run through that and then
ask me why I tried to shoot that penny-a-liner! Those are
clippings. Most of them are foreign, but you&rsquo;ll find some in
English.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vogel turned the first few leaves of the book, then he looked up
incredulously. &ldquo;What the devil&mdash;? Are
<em>you</em>&mdash;Maria di Nardi?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am. Or I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; The prosecutor stared at Mrs. Holmes.
Lopez looked over his shoulder and read the yellowed headlines.
Together they examined the photographs on the bed and compared them
with the huge slattern before them. The pictures were old; those in
street dress were quaintly out of date, but many were in operatic
costumes which the men readily recognized. All showed a young woman
of magnificent physical proportions and considerable beauty. In the
shapeless figure and the bloated face before them none of that
beauty remained; nevertheless the likeness was recognizable.</p>

<p>Vogel rose to his feet in genuine agitation. &ldquo;This is
astonishing! I knew of you, of course, although I never heard you
sing. I&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;incredible!&rdquo; He stared about
at his surroundings. &ldquo;Do the newspapers know who you
are?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody knows who I am, except my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have a son?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes nodded. In a few words she told her callers about
Jerry, and from her tone as much as from her words they drew pretty
accurate conclusions as to the relations existing between her and
her boy.</p>

<p>For perhaps an hour Vogel and Lopez took turns questioning the
woman, then they drove her back to town with them. In Vogel&rsquo;s
office she repeated her story to a stenographer, read it in
typewritten form, then swore to it.</p>

<p>When, at last, she had been sent home, Lopez exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! That&rsquo;s the biggest wallop I ever had. It
upsets everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! She <em>must</em> be telling the truth, but
you&rsquo;re going to have a hard job to make a jury believe
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to check up, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be easy. But remember, she&rsquo;s
&lsquo;queer.&rsquo; Everybody knows she&rsquo;s drunk half the
time. She&rsquo;s a notorious character and&mdash;well,
she&rsquo;ll prejudice herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of that. I&rsquo;ll see that she
makes a good impression. I&rsquo;m going to get her out of that
pigsty, dress her up, and put her in a hotel and make her look like
a human being. I&rsquo;ll take her off the whisky, too, and make
sure that she doesn&rsquo;t talk until I&rsquo;m ready to have her
talk. This isn&rsquo;t an ordinary case, Chief; it&rsquo;s a
newspaper trial. When the time comes I&rsquo;m going to explode
something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;ll be a big thing for you if you can get a
conviction where our local people have failed to even start
anything. But speaking of explosions, what about the Woods girl?
This kind of blows up our theory about her, doesn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I show that &lsquo;Thursday&rsquo; letter to the
reporters? They&rsquo;re after me every day to see it. They know
about as much as we do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show them nothing until I tell you to. Now then, locate
that automobile with one headlight just as quickly as you can and
bring me the name of the man who drove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next day Mary Holmes hired a neighbor to take charge of her
poultry farm, then she dressed in her best, packed a few belongings
in a valise and went to a hotel in town, where she found a room
already engaged for her and a woman awaiting her arrival. The
stranger proved to be a matron from the girls&rsquo; reformatory.
Together the two women visited several shops and department stores
and made numerous purchases. A hair dresser and a manicurist were
at the hotel when they returned; with their aid and under the
matron&rsquo;s directions Mary Holmes went through quite a
transformation. Later in the afternoon she put herself in the hands
of a facial masseuse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes experienced a great pride and a great satisfaction
in her changed appearance, also a growing elation at the full
realization of her new situation. She would have been thoroughly
contented with the state of affairs except for one thing&mdash;she
discovered that the matron had gone through her valise and removed
her bottle of gin, her storm anchor. She hinted that she was quite
tired and let down after the day&rsquo;s excitement and felt the
need of a little stimulant, but the matron told her firmly that she
must do without. It was Mr. Vogel&rsquo;s orders. Mrs. Holmes
argued that she had a bad heart and was subject to
&ldquo;low&rdquo; spells; her doctor had prescribed a small nip of
liquor, several times a day&mdash;not enough to be intoxicating, of
course, just sufficient to keep her poor heart going. He had
recommended whisky, but gin was so much more easily obtained. As a
matter of fact, good gin, real gin, was being made everywhere.
Anybody could make gin, whereas most of the manufactured whisky
nowadays&mdash;well, it wasn&rsquo;t whisky at all. A person could
never be sure it hadn&rsquo;t been distilled in some zinc
automobile tank and wasn&rsquo;t actually poisonous. If her
companion cared to secure some good, safe gin&mdash;for medicinal
purposes&mdash;Mrs. Holmes could put her in touch with a cheap and
reliable source of supply. Three-fifty a bottle. It was dirt
cheap!</p>

<p>But the matron did not drink gin and she declared very firmly
that she did not propose to let her charge drink any. That, in
fact, was the principal reason for her presence here, and Mrs.
Holmes might as well make up her mind right now to indulge in
nothing more heart stimulating than tea and coffee until Mr. Vogel
was through with her.</p>

<p>This domineering attitude resulted in a stormy scene during
which Mrs. Holmes indignantly demanded to know if she was free,
white, and twenty-one, or if she was Mr. Vogel&rsquo;s prisoner,
his slave. The matron informed her coldly that she could consider
herself anything that pleased her, but if she insisted upon
disobeying the prosecuting attorney he could find ready means of
committing her to some place where she would be forcibly restrained
from making a beast of herself.</p>

<p>In spite of her pleasant surroundings, Mrs. Holmes slept badly
that night and when she awoke she was irritable, her nerves were
unstrung.</p>

<p>In his investigation of the Ethridge murder Mr. Vogel&rsquo;s
diligence was not prompted solely by an impersonal desire to solve
a mystery and to bring the perpetrator of a dastardly crime to
justice. Few officials are animated by motives so simple and so
public spirited. He had not asked to handle this case; the
assignment had been forced upon him by reason of the widespread
interest which the press awakened in it. Quite naturally,
therefore, he had determined to get as much publicity as possible
out of it for himself. To that end he had kept in close touch with
the newspaper men and periodically had fed them enough news, both
real and imaginary, to keep the case, and his name, on the front
page. But reporters are wise and worldly; daily they were becoming
more difficult to handle; some of them had begun to refer rather
bitingly in their daily stories to his lack of progress and several
had told him that they would be called in before long unless there
was something doing. Had Vogel been entirely unselfish he would
have welcomed an opportunity to work unhindered and unembarrassed,
but as it was he urged them to wait and promised important
developments in a short time. They waited. Westland waited. The
country waited.</p>

<p>Vogel kept his promise. He sent for the reporters. He kept them
waiting for an hour before admitting them to his private office,
then he asked them to be seated while he read them an
affidavit.</p>

<p>It was an amazing document that they listened to&mdash;it was
the stenographic report of a carefully prepared statement by Mary
Holmes. Mrs. Holmes &ldquo;being duly sworn,&rdquo; etc., recited
that about ten o&rsquo;clock on the night upon which Amos Ethridge
had met his death an automobile had passed her house going east and
had stopped near the entrance to the Ethridge lane. There it had
turned off the road into a small grove of pine trees which were
visible from her front window. That which had caused her in
particular to notice this car was the fact that it was running with
one headlight. When it stopped in the grove, this one light had
been turned off. She had wondered what anyone could be doing in
that place at such an hour and had suspected that it might be
somebody from the Italian settlement contemplating a raid on her
chicken house. Marauders had robbed her roosts so often that she
had been forced to buy a watchdog.</p>

<p>She would have satisfied herself promptly, only for the fact
that her son Gerald arrived a few minutes later and his coming
drove it out of her mind. Gerald had remained with her until after
midnight. When he had gone, apprehension, or perhaps curiosity to
see if the car was still there, had prompted her to investigate.
She had walked up the road, moving slowly and cautiously. She was
still some distance from the pine grove when another car had
approached from behind her, and in order to avoid detection in the
glare of its lights she had stepped aside into a clump of bushes.
This second car had turned at the lane and had stopped, with its
lights brilliantly illuminating the gate and the shrubbery on each
side of it. Mrs. Holmes had recognized the driver, when he got out
to open the gate, as Amos Ethridge.</p>

<p>Vogel paused and glanced at the reporters. They were frozen in
various attitudes of attention, so he resumed his reading:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was much relieved to see him there and I was just about
to call to him and ask him to wait a minute when I saw something
very strange and startling. Suddenly, without warning, the bushes
parted and a man stepped out. He was dressed in a long white cloak
or mantle. I thought it must be a ghost!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question. Describe this man, please, as closely as you
can.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer. I&rsquo;m afraid I can&rsquo;t describe him very
accurately. I was nervous and frightened, anyhow, and
this&mdash;this apparition made it worse. He was tall and I think
he wore a mask, but I&rsquo;m not sure. Maybe he just wore a hat
and it shaded his face. That&rsquo;s all I seem to remember&mdash;a
tall man in a long robe, but I heard him speak to Mr. Ethridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question. What did you hear him say?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer. He called him by name, then he said something
about a woman. It sounded as if he said, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t let
you take her away from me.&rsquo; Something like that.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question. You are positive that he said something about a
woman?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer. Yes. I remember that distinctly. Then he shot Mr.
Ethridge. He shot him twice, before he could fall. He kept shooting
at him as he lay on the ground. It was horrible. I thought I must
be dreaming or that it was a scene on a dark stage played in a
spotlight and I was away out at the front of the house&mdash;it
seemed so unreal. What happened next is pretty confused. I was
deathly afraid and I didn&rsquo;t dare cry out or move for fear the
assassin might have confederates near by and they&rsquo;d kill me,
too. I just stood there staring and shaking. I saw the man kneel
over Mr. Ethridge&rsquo;s body, but his back was to me. I presume
he was fixing that cross of twigs. Then he got up, passed out of
the glare of the headlights, and turned them off. After that, of
course, I couldn&rsquo;t see what he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Question. What did you do?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Answer. I stood still. I didn&rsquo;t dare move. By and
by I saw another light, across the road in the pine grove, so I
dropped to my knees and crouched in the weeds and bushes. I stayed
there until the other car passed me&mdash;the car with one
headlight. Then I got up and ran home. I suppose I ran home:
anyhow, I found myself there with all my doors locked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vogel laid aside the document from which he had been reading and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That, gentlemen, is the gist of Mrs. Holmes&rsquo;s sworn
statement, which she made voluntarily. Rather extraordinary,
eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you believe it?&rdquo; somebody inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Absolutely! Chief Lopez and I questioned her carefully
and we failed to shake her on any point. What&rsquo;s more, we
examined the roadside where she claimed she hid, and we found an
old glove which had lain there for some time. It was her glove. She
showed us the mate to it at her house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it!&rdquo; one of
the local newspaper men declared. &ldquo;I talked to her the next
morning&mdash;I asked her a thousand questions&mdash;and she
didn&rsquo;t tell me any such story. It sounds altogether too
theatrical. People don&rsquo;t happen along country roads after
midnight just in time to see murders committed in the glare of
automobile headlights. Why didn&rsquo;t she spill this
sooner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She says the talk about the Ku-Klux frightened
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a common drunk; she&rsquo;s eccentric and
utterly unreliable. I know all about her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; Vogel grinned sarcastically. &ldquo;Then
you probably know who she really is. You know her stage
name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His listeners pricked up their ears, but he forestalled their
questions by saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m making you boys a present of
a big story that you weren&rsquo;t smart enough to get for
yourselves. How many of you remember a grand-opera singer by the
name of Maria di Nardi? Not many. She was before your time. But I
remember her and you can look her up. She lost her voice right at
the height of her career and dropped out of sight; was forgotten.
One of the tragedies of the profession! She&rsquo;s living in
Westland and her name is&mdash;Mary Holmes! Oh, you don&rsquo;t
have to take my word for it. I&rsquo;ve got her here and she can
prove who she is! You can talk to her as much as you please. Break
down her story if you can. It&rsquo;s more than I&rsquo;ve been
able to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But wait!&rdquo; another man queried, eagerly.
&ldquo;What about the one-eyed automobile and the fellow in the
robe? Have you got him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vogel smiled again, this time complacently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
ask me to tell you everything I know. I&rsquo;m giving you this
story because the Ethridge case is being tried in the newspapers
and because you boys have worked hard on it. I&rsquo;m treating you
squarely and I expect square treatment in return. Understand? All
right! Make the most of what you&rsquo;ve got and&mdash;maybe
I&rsquo;ll have another story for you tomorrow. Possibly this
evening.&rdquo; With these words the speaker opened the door to an
inner office and called Mrs. Holmes.</p>

<p>When she appeared the newspaper men eyed her in astonishment,
for she was amazingly changed. She was no longer the unlovely
creature some of them had seen and all of them had written about;
she was a quite imposing middle-aged woman. Her hair no longer hung
in greasy snarls, it was soft and clean and smoothly combed; her
body had shape, and a good-looking street dress lent pleasing lines
to it; there were silk hose and high-heeled shoes upon her feet.
More astonishing than this, however, was the alteration in the
woman herself. She entered the room with her head up and with a
poise, a carriage that only the stage can teach; in her bearing was
a dignity that brought the reporters to their feet and kept them
standing until Vogel had introduced her and had given her a
chair.</p>

<p>This was Mary Holmes&rsquo;s hour and she made the most of it.
She took a tremendous satisfaction out of the evident embarrassment
of these young men. They had maligned her and she hated them for
it, but she concealed her feelings behind an air of modesty and
simplicity which was anything but genuine. She would have enjoyed
nothing more than to turn the vials of her wrath upon them, to
blister them with her scorn, but, realizing that through them she
was talking to a vast audience, she rose to the occasion as she had
risen to other roles.</p>

<p>Vogel had cleverly stage-managed her appearance and she had
rehearsed herself well. The result was all and more than either of
them had anticipated&mdash;she scored a triumph. She was acting, of
course, but what a part to play and what an audience to play to! An
audience consisting of America, the world! The world that had
forgotten her! Well, it would remember her now and it would throb
and sympathize with her story. That story, to her mind, was
infinitely more dramatic, infinitely more important, than the story
of the Ethridge murder, and upon her lips it became a poignant,
moving tragedy. She set the reporters afire.</p>

<p>Vogel had made her bring her scrap-books of yellowed clippings
and her photographs; he had also arranged for press photographers
and camera men from the news weeklies, for here was a subject
suitable for the screen reviews. When Mrs. Holmes left the
building, she faced a battery of still and moving-picture cameras,
and a way for her had to be cleared through the
curiosity-seekers.</p>

<p>Word quickly spread that an actual eye-witness of the Ethridge
slaying had come forward with an incredible story and a mob
followed Mrs. Holmes to her hotel. It swarmed into the lobby and up
to the elevator gates, reminding her of the crowds that had
followed her in Paris, in Vienna. She would have liked to step out
of her room to some balcony, with her arms full of roses, and throw
kisses to the street below.</p>

<p>In a surprisingly short time extras were out and Mrs. Holmes
heard them being shouted. They contained little but headlines and a
brief statement of facts, but she read them avidly and could
scarcely wait for the fuller accounts and for the arrival of the
big Chicago dailies the next morning. It fed her vanity to realize
that in many quarters upon typewriter keys and telegraph
instruments fast-flying fingers were pounding out her life story
and that it was being cast into molten metal for the world to read.
Those old photographs which had lain so long in the dark were being
reproduced and new ones finished! Mary Holmes, &ldquo;the goose
woman,&rdquo; had set the presses of the country a-spinning; Maria
di Nardi, the forgotten darling of grand opera, was being
reborn.</p>

<p>Sustained emotion, such as she had undergone today, demanded
relief, and again she appealed to the matron for some whisky. But
the latter was firm. Mrs. Holmes was too excited to eat any supper,
nor could she sleep when bedtime came. Habit had become fixed,
restraint had only whetted keener her desire for drink, and her
outraged system clamored fiercely for its accustomed anodyne. She
paced the floor until long after her companion had retired.</p>

<p>She wondered why Jerry did not communicate with her. He must
have heard those newsboys bawling &ldquo;extra&rdquo; by this time
and&mdash;But of course he was mad at her for getting into print;
he abhorred notoriety. A shrinking violet, that was Jerry! Bah! He
had offered to make her over if she&rsquo;d let him! Well, she had
made herself over. She wished he could see her tonight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes rang for a bellboy and asked him the earliest
possible moment he could secure for her the morning papers. The boy
volunteered to go to the offices and fetch the first copies off the
press; that would probably be about three o&rsquo;clock. This gave
the woman an idea, and she inquired if by any chance he could at
the same time secure for her a little stimulant, preferably whisky,
although gin would do. The boy assured her that he could. He
did.</p>

<p>Mary Holmes found pictures of herself on the damp front pages.
The stories that went with them were all that she could have
desired. She smiled, to be sure, at Vogel&rsquo;s positive
assertion that he was on the trail of &ldquo;the man in the
robe&rdquo; and that his arrest was merely a matter of hours. Vogel
was a great grand-stander. He amused the reader. She lowered the
liquor in her bottle and felt her tautened nerves relax, felt a
grateful ease and contentment creep through her.</p>

<p>When the matron came to awaken her charge in the morning she
found her lying across her bed with her clothes on, and with an
empty flask beside her.</p>

<p>There was a perfectly good reason why Gerald Holmes did not
communicate with his mother that night; he was, for the time being,
out of communication with anybody. Even while the evening extras
were in process of printing he had been taken to police
headquarters and there put through an examination sufficiently
rigorous to be termed the &ldquo;third degree.&rdquo; At first he
was humiliated and bewildered, although scarcely alarmed; he
answered questions frankly and fully, not realizing in the least
that every word he uttered closed the net more tightly about
him.</p>

<p>The police began by asking him about his relations with Hazel
Woods, and he told them of his engagement to her. He also admitted
ownership of an automobile and identified a linen dust coat as his
property, although why the police had taken pains to filch it from
the car and bring it here he could not imagine. With equal
readiness he admitted having driven out to his mother&rsquo;s farm
on the evening of the murder and having left the car in the pine
grove near the entrance to the Ethridge lane. Yes, his right
headlight had been out of commission.</p>

<p>To Gerald it seemed inconceivable that these men could actually
suspect him of complicity in the crime. Not until he had gone over
and over the story of his trip out and back and had detailed his
every action on that night without in the least impressing them did
he begin to appreciate the seriousness of his situation. Why should
they suspect him of the murder, he demanded to know. Why should he
wish to harm the man who had done more for him than anybody in
Westland? What possible motive could he have for destroying his
benefactor?</p>

<p>They told him why, in language so plain, so brutal, that he was
stricken dumb. Miss Woods had been Amos Ethridge&rsquo;s sweetheart
and the cottage she occupied was their love nest. She was the
writer of that &ldquo;Thursday&rdquo; note which had been found on
his body, and, after the show on the night of his slaying, he had
called upon her, as was his frequent habit. He had gone directly
from her arms to his death.</p>

<p>Gerald leaped to his feet. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie!&rdquo; he
shouted. In a fury he struck at the speaker. No attempt was made to
quiet him; on the contrary, his inquisitors undertook to capitalize
his agitation. They goaded him; they taunted him with being a fool;
they told him things about Ethridge and the girl that would have
driven any lover frantic. Vogel came in while this was going on,
but he took no part in the proceedings. When Jerry refused to be
convinced, when again he called them liars and defied them to shake
his faith in his fianc&eacute;e, they shifted their tactics and
read him his mother&rsquo;s deposition. He listened while
incredulity changed to despair.</p>

<p>When they had finished he told them, miserably: &ldquo;You
shouldn&rsquo;t believe that. She&rsquo;s&mdash;not altogether
responsible. She drinks more than she should and there are times
when she&rsquo;s apt to do or say almost anything. She&rsquo;s not
a credible witness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She wasn&rsquo;t drunk when she swore to this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see, there&rsquo;s just enough
truth to what she says to make it all sound plausible? She
doesn&rsquo;t know that I have an automobile. I didn&rsquo;t tell
her because&mdash;well, because she would have considered it an
extravagance, so she doesn&rsquo;t realize it was my car she saw
pass the house. I did leave it at the grove and it did have only
one headlight. Yes, and she saw the tracks there the next morning.
But she didn&rsquo;t actually see the murder, or she&rsquo;d have
told me. Why, we talked it over when I got back from Chicago and
she never said a word about it! Bring her here. Take me to her.
She&rsquo;ll set this thing straight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You better come clean,&rdquo; one of the detectives told
him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll save a lot of trouble and you&rsquo;re not
doing yourself any good raving like this. You may save yourself
from the gallows.&rdquo; In spite of himself Gerald flinched.
&ldquo;Pretty rotten to kill the man who befriended you. The jury
won&rsquo;t be out twenty minutes. Why, listen to this and do a
little thinking for yourself. Ethridge likes you, pays your way
through art school, and one day he introduces you to his gal. You
fall for her, like any sucker, and want to marry her until you
discover she&rsquo;s his sweetie. But she knows a good thing when
she&rsquo;s got it and she stalls you. All those Janes have a young
fellow on the side! Of course you&rsquo;re familiar with
Ethridge&rsquo;s habits; you know how he drives home that back way
every night after he&rsquo;s been to see her, so nobody will get
wise, and you know he has to get out to open that gate. You know
every inch of the ground out there, having been raised on the spot.
You buy a cheap car so you can get around&mdash;people on trolleys
are likely to be seen and recognized, late at night. What&rsquo;s a
guy like you, a picture-painter, want of an automobile, eh? All
right. One night when Ethridge has a date with your gal&mdash;his
gal&mdash;you beat it out to see your mother. You&rsquo;re a nice,
dutiful mamma&rsquo;s boy, only you&rsquo;re not living at home.
No, you&rsquo;ve got your own place in town and you leave her alone
with the chickens. You park your fliv where it&rsquo;s handy to the
lane; then you frame an alibi by calling on the old lady. But you
take pains to duck just before Ethridge is due home. Fine!
It&rsquo;s a wonder you didn&rsquo;t set the clock back when she
wasn&rsquo;t looking and call her attention to it. They usually
do.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you get a bad break&mdash;one in a thousand. Your
mother goes up the road in time to see you give Ethridge the works.
Tough for you she wasn&rsquo;t close enough to recognize your voice
or see your face; she&rsquo;d have kept her mouth closed if she
had, no doubt. Women are like that. But, not knowing you had a car,
she spills everything to Mr. Vogel, and he plays her just right. We
have you covered before he brings her into town. And by the way,
remember the two wops that talked to you the night you went back to
hide your tracks in case she suspected you? Your right headlight
was out that night, too. Why, man, everything checks up, even to
the white robe, or &lsquo;mantle,&rsquo; as she calls it! We find
this light-colored dust coat in your car. It ain&rsquo;t exactly
white and it ain&rsquo;t a &lsquo;robe,&rsquo; but it&rsquo;s close
enough. I never saw a cleaner set-up. Better call it a day and sign
on the dotted line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gerald spoke quietly, listlessly: &ldquo;You almost make me
believe I did it, but there&rsquo;s one thing you can&rsquo;t make
me believe and that&rsquo;s what you say about&mdash;Miss
Woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That night while his mother greedily read about herself in the
papers and drank herself into a triumphant stupor Jerry sat on the
edge of a bunk in the city prison.</p>

<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>

<p>Westland was in a furore. There was but one topic of
conversation. The Ethridge case had &ldquo;broken&rdquo; finally
and the explosion rocked the city, for nothing so fantastic as the
true facts had been conceived in the most imaginative mind. To
begin with, the story of Ethridge&rsquo;s &ldquo;love nest&rdquo;
and its charming occupant&mdash;which, by the way, the papers
featured in screaming headlines&mdash;was sufficiently scandalous
to delight the prurient minded. Then, too, the identity of the
slayer was a genuine surprise. A wicked rou&eacute;, a seductive
actress, a Cupid&rsquo;s bower, and a jealous young lover! It was
the oldest, the most hackneyed situation known to newspaper
reporting: it was hokum of the highest quality, sure-fire stuff.
Anybody could write it, everybody would read it. To have the lover
prove to be a base ingrate was an added touch and a tasty morsel.
But the thrill, the drama, lay in the fact that the ingrate&rsquo;s
mother had actually witnessed the murder and, in absolute innocence
of the part she played, had brought him to justice! Here was
something stunning; here was a coincidence truly uncanny; here was
the hand of God. Yes, and the final denouement, coming right on top
of the discovery of her real identity, was piling sensation upon
sensation.</p>

<p>To the general mind it was a peculiarly satisfying case because
the motives were plain and understandable and because the persons
involved, outside of the unfortunate mother, excited no sympathy
whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. Vogel came in for great praise for the expedition with which
he had solved a baffling mystery; the chain of evidence he had
forged was so strong and so complete that nobody questioned it. On
Sunday, the day after Gerald&rsquo;s arrest, more than one sermon
had for its text &ldquo;The wages of sin,&rdquo; and from pulpits,
not alone in Westland, earnest preachers thundered against rich men
of evil life, the ingratitude of youth, and the scarlet women of
the stage.</p>

<p>On Monday came the news that Mary Holmes was ill, completely
prostrated by her son&rsquo;s arrest and by the frightful
realization of what she had done. This, too, was tasty. People
enjoy sympathizing with the innocent.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes was indeed ill, not, however, by reason of what she
had sworn to, but by reason of what she had drunk. That
bellboy&rsquo;s choice of bootleggers had not been wise and Vogel
had been summoned early Sunday morning to learn that his principal
witness was suffering from &ldquo;non-alcoholic&rdquo; poisoning.
Realizing that the truth regarding her condition would surely
become known and very likely prejudice her reliability as a witness
if he sent her to a hospital, he insisted that she remain where she
was, meanwhile receiving, of course, the best medical attention. He
it was who gave out the story of her collapse.</p>

<p>Gerald, very naturally, had no reason to question the cause of
his mother&rsquo;s illness. It seemed to him that his plight was
enough to prostrate her, but it destroyed his immediate hopes of
disproving the charges against him. He was allowed to read the
papers, but what he read appalled him. It was conceivable, of
course, that his mother had actually witnessed the killing, as she
maintained, and had told him nothing about it&mdash;she was
eccentric; there was no telling what she might do or how she was
likely to behave under the influence of liquor&mdash;but he
strongly doubted this and clung to the conviction that she would
confess to a wild and imaginative romance or that somebody would
prove her story to be, in part, at least, the fanciful creation of
an alcoholic brain. But would she confess? How could she bring
herself to do so? Granting that she now realized where the truth of
her story ended and imagination began, an assumption which, by the
way, was not likely, was her love for him sufficient to warrant
humiliation? Moreover, could she undo the wrong she had done, even
if she tried? These were questions Gerald could not answer. At a
matter of fact, he did not try very hard to answer them, for
something more important than his own welfare weighed him down and
rendered him apathetic&mdash;it was the misfortune that had
befallen Hazel. From what he read in the newspapers it seemed to
him that he was the only person in the world who believed in her.
The poor girl must be suffering more keenly than he. Hers was the
greater tragedy.</p>

<p>Gerald was surprised on Monday to receive a visit from two
lawyers, members of the leading local firm, and to learn that they
had been retained as his counsel. He assumed, of course, that his
mother had sent them and he took cheer from that fact, but he
gained little comfort out of talking with them aside from the
realization that some one stood beside him.</p>

<p>He had expected some word, some communication from Hazel; but
none came and at last her silence convinced him that she, too,
believed in his guilt. It was a bitter pill to swallow, but, after
all, why should she doubt his own mother&rsquo;s word?</p>

<p>Some people are possessed of such implicit belief in themselves,
such self-confidence, and such high regard for their own
importance, that they assume others must share that faith. It is a
form of conceit, and no doubt it is a blessing to the possessor,
but Jerry was not conceited. He was a humble-minded, modest young
man and he considered himself of very little consequence indeed.
Upon consideration it seemed quite natural that Hazel should wish
to be assured of his innocence before yielding to her impulses. Had
he not tried her sufficiently without putting her love to this
test? He told himself that he had.</p>

<p>For several days Mary Holmes remained a very sick woman. Instead
of enjoying her unparalleled publicity she lay abed weak,
nauseated, suffering wretchedly. When at last she was able to lift
her head she eagerly demanded the daily papers and a complete
account of all that had happened since she was stricken, but not
until she was strong enough to sit up did the doctor permit her
curiosity to be gratified. Then he told her guardedly that the
&ldquo;man in the robe&rdquo; had been arrested and that the
Ethridge case had been solved. He did not tell her who that man
was, but he prepared her for a shock. She listened incredulously,
in a daze. He gave her the papers finally and left her alone to
read them.</p>

<p>He returned to the sick room after a while to find his patient
staring blankly at the wall. &ldquo;I thought you might feel the
need of a stimulant,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes did not hear him. &ldquo;Did&mdash;Jerry do
it?&rdquo; she inquired, stupidly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to know. You saw him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they can&rsquo;t&mdash;they can&rsquo;t do anything
to him on evidence like mine, can they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? It&rsquo;s hard to get a conviction on purely
circumstantial evidence, but yours is direct.&rdquo; There was a
moment of silence. &ldquo;The reporters are calling up every few
hours. They want to interview you as soon as you&rsquo;re able to
talk to them. Everybody is curious to know what you&rsquo;ll have
to say. Yes, and the Woods girl has been here half a dozen
times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t see them, nor her, either. Why does
<em>she</em> want to talk to me? Hasn&rsquo;t she done enough? I
shouldn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d dare show her face on the street
after causing all this and after everybody knows what she
is.&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes found the doctor staring curiously at her;
in irritation she flared out: &ldquo;Why are you looking at me like
that? What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a queer creature. I was wondering how it
feels for a mother&mdash;But you can&rsquo;t be much of a
mother.&rdquo; The speaker shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How <em>dare</em> you?&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes cried, shrilly.
&ldquo;The idea of your talking to me like that! I&rsquo;m sick.
I&rsquo;m in no condition to&mdash;Why, even the newspapers
blackguard me! But how did I know? What could I do? I never dreamed
I&rsquo;d&mdash;that it was&mdash;Jerry I saw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without comment the doctor turned and left the room.</p>

<p>The sick woman raised herself laboriously, gathered the
newspapers together, and flung them as far as she could. A terribly
bitter but impotent feeling of resentment came over her; tears wet
her cheeks. Again she had been foiled. The world was always against
her. Why did everything she touched go wrong? Why was she
frustrated in everything she tried to do? So Jerry had bought an
automobile without telling her about it! That&rsquo;s where the
whole trouble had started&mdash;out of his deceit. He was not only
cold and indifferent; he was deceitful. He had been her ruin, from
the very first; now he had ruined both of them. But he had brought
this upon himself. The fool! She had never hated anybody as she
hated him at this moment, for once again he had turned her triumph
into disaster. . . . How could she help hating him when he despised
her and disapproved of everything she did? Well, why should she
worry? There was no love lost between them and the mere fact of
their relationship meant nothing. It was an irksome tie. . . .
There had been a time when it meant something; he had seemed to
care a great deal for her when he was a little boy. . . . He had
been a pretty boy, by the way, with cute, lovable ways. Mrs. Holmes
stirred restlessly and rolled her head. But no longer! All he did
now was preach and voice his contempt. . . . Contempt from her own
son. Well, this would take him down a peg. He&rsquo;d have to get
out of this scrape the best way he could: she did not propose to
make a liar out of herself, to make herself ridiculous
or&mdash;worse. . . . She couldn&rsquo;t go back on her sworn
statement, even if she wanted to. That was perjury. And this Woods
hussy who had played at love-making with him, what did she want?
Help, of course, in clearing him. Humph! Some mothers might feel
called upon to go to extreme lengths for their sons, but not she.
No. She would not talk to her.</p>

<p>The next day, however, when Hazel Woods came again, Mary Holmes
suddenly changed her mind and had the girl sent upstairs. She was
feeling strong enough to sit up in a chair by this time; she
steeled herself to endure some hysterical out-burst, some
extravagant appeal to her sympathies. It surprised her when none
came. Miss Woods ,was haggard and listless, but she was in perfect
control of herself. She had fine eyes, the elder woman noted, but
they were hopeless and they gave the impression of thorough defeat.
She made it plain with her first words that she accepted as true
what had been given out through the papers&mdash;namely, that Mrs.
Holmes&rsquo;s illness was the result of shock and maternal
anxiety, and took it for granted that she was ready to join in any
effort, however desperate, to undo the mischief she had caused.</p>

<p>This gave the mother a disagreeable sensation. She inquired
coldly, &ldquo;Have you been to see him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hazel shook her head; her voice faltered. &ldquo;How could I,
after what came out? I was tried, convicted, and&mdash;publicly
branded, all in one day. It would only cause him pain to see me and
I can spare him that.&rdquo; After a moment she went on:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done what little I can. I&rsquo;ve hired the best
lawyers in the city, but&mdash;that is so little.&rdquo; Again she
choked. &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Holmes, he didn&rsquo;t do it! I know it
and so do you, but what can we do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;Nothing, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We <em>must</em> do something. Don&rsquo;t you understand
the danger he&rsquo;s in? If it hadn&rsquo;t been for your
statement&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, blame it on me!&rdquo; irritably cried the
elder woman. &ldquo;I suppose everybody expects me to&mdash;to go
back on my oath, just because he&rsquo;s my son.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl pondered this gravely, then nodded. &ldquo;Why, yes, I
suppose they do expect that. It&rsquo;s what any mother would do.
<em>I&rsquo;d</em> lie. I&rsquo;d steal, I&rsquo;d sin, I&rsquo;d
do&mdash;<em>anything</em> if I had one. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has never been a real son to me. He never cared a snap
for me. He has caused me every bit of unhappiness I ever had.
I&rsquo;ve had more than my share, by the way.&rdquo; The
speaker&rsquo;s tone was one of utmost bitterness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet it makes no difference, does it? You love him
just the same.&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes uttered a derisive sound.
&ldquo;Oh, now! Why try to deceive me? We women nurse our babies at
our breasts and no matter how old or how big or how bad they become
they&rsquo;re still our babies and we fight for them, tooth and
nail. I&rsquo;m a woman. I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! We fight for our lovers, too. Do you,
honestly&mdash;care for Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love him. I want him so much that I&rsquo;d&mdash;burn
eternally to have him for one day, one hour. You must know how I
feel. I&rsquo;m speaking now to Maria di Nardi. . . . But
that&rsquo;s not all. I care for him so sincerely that I
wouldn&rsquo;t marry him, even if he asked me. It&rsquo;s too late.
You understand that, don&rsquo;t you? He can be cleared; he can
make a name for himself; people will forget, so far as he is
concerned. But they&rsquo;ll never forget the girl in the Ethridge
case. You see, Mrs. Holmes, I&rsquo;m not the great artist that you
were. You had a God-given voice and a God-given genius. Maria di
Nardi wasn&rsquo;t an ordinary woman; she was more; she was one out
of many millions. She loved and she suffered more intensely than we
common women; she topped greater heights and sounded lower depths.
Jerry told me the story you told him. It is the divine talent, the
heaven-sent gift of the artist, that we must worship, not the weak,
human artist herself. The one is so insignificant, so unimportant
as compared with the other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Holmes experienced a grateful warmth about her heart at
these words. Here was a fellow &ldquo;professional,&rdquo; a woman
with soul and understanding. Hazel was still speaking:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry feels the same way. Even what you told him that
last night made no real difference in his regard for you. When you
say he is no son, that he never loved you, you are so mistaken. The
world suffered a loss when you lost your voice, but you have passed
on, through him, a talent perhaps as precious as your own. It must
be saved&mdash;not for us only, but for the world. Your career was
ruined: you can&rsquo;t permit his to be destroyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I only told what I saw,&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes
declared, uncertainly. &ldquo;I swore to it and you know what it
means when you swear to a thing. Why&mdash;they&rsquo;d arrest me,
for all I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a terrible mistake somewhere,&rdquo;
the girl earnestly asserted. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain the car
with one headlight&mdash;the car that passed you after the
shooting&mdash;and yet Jerry declares he left your house an hour
before the murder and drove straight to town. He&rsquo;s telling
the truth: I <em>know</em> he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They claim he laid in wait.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But they couldn&rsquo;t prove it without you! It&rsquo;s
your evidence that contradicts him. You didn&rsquo;t actually
recognize him&mdash;you said so! And if it had been Jerry
you&rsquo;d have known him. Of course you would! You&rsquo;d know
your own boy anywhere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;was too far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hazel protested breathlessly: &ldquo;No, no! Think! Oh, God,
think of <em>something</em> to show it wasn&rsquo;t he! Some
action, some gesture, some peculiarity! Maybe there were two
headlights on that last car and you were mistaken. It&rsquo;s so
easy to be mistaken and just that one point might save him. Think!
If it were me I&rsquo;d&mdash;think of something. I&rsquo;d&mdash;
But they&rsquo;ve discredited me; there&rsquo;s nothing I can do.
I&rsquo;m utterly helpless.&rdquo; She broke down now and, hiding
her face in her hands, she sobbed wretchedly; the tears came
through her fingers. There was a poignant quality to her grief. She
was very young and very frail. Mrs. Holmes realized that this
tragedy had broken her like a butterfly. A curse on men like Amos
Ethridge! Yes, and on men like Vogel!</p>

<p>After a while the mother said, roughly: &ldquo;Go away! Give me
a chance to think. Mind you, I don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s any
use but&mdash;&rdquo; Again she broke out in gusty vexation.
&ldquo;Oh, why does everything I do turn out wrong? It&rsquo;s his
fault as much as mine. It&rsquo;s easy for you to tell me to lie,
to perjure myself&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t. I merely say what I&rsquo;d&mdash;be
willing&mdash;to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right! All right! Go along now. I&rsquo;ll let you
know if I can think of anything, but I&rsquo;m sick. That&rsquo;s
my luck. Sick! That&rsquo;s how things go with me. I&mdash;I wish I
were dead!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That afternoon Vogel called at the hotel in accordance with a
request from Mrs. Holmes, and after she had beat about the bush for
a while she told him haltingly that she wished to make a new
affidavit. There were certain points in her first one that she
realized, upon careful thought, needed explanation, modification.
Vogel listened until she had finished, then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been expecting this. Save it for the
trial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;the trouble is Jerry&rsquo;s being tried now,
in the newspapers. The verdict will be in before the jury goes
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe he&rsquo;s guilty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woman averted her eyes. &ldquo;There are some people who
couldn&rsquo;t commit a murder, and he&rsquo;s one. There&rsquo;s
nothing vicious about him. He liked Mr. Ethridge and he knew
nothing whatever about the Woods affair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing vicious, eh? Nothing vicious about his mother,
either, I suppose?&rdquo; Vogel grinned derisively. &ldquo;Tell
that to the reporter you shot at.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes argued feebly until he broke in: &ldquo;I understand
you perfectly, and your feelings do you credit. But I am a servant
of the people and the law must be upheld. I sincerely regret that
in doing your duty you placed your son in jeopardy, but it&rsquo;s
not the first time such a thing has happened. Justice must be
served and murder will out. Truth is more sacred even than a
mother&rsquo;s love. It&rsquo;s my task to discover the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you <em>haven&rsquo;t</em>. I
was&mdash;mistaken,&rdquo; the woman protested. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not going to let an innocent person suffer for my
mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mistake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, call it whatever you want to. I gave wrong
testimony. I&mdash;lied!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed? It&rsquo;s too bad you&rsquo;re so late
confessing it. Now see here&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker&rsquo;s tone
changed&mdash;&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll end this foolishness right now.
I&rsquo;m not going to let you make a monkey out of me, whatever
your natural impulses may be. I dare say you&rsquo;ll testify that
I deceived or coerced you; put words into your mouth; induced you
to sign something you didn&rsquo;t read. We&rsquo;ll see! Are you
going to play straight, do your duty as a citizen and stick to what
you said, or&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. I can&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m going to tell the
truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Vogel rose. &ldquo;Thanks for letting me know. If you choose to
discredit yourself in any such manner I&rsquo;ll make a good job of
it. You see, I&rsquo;ve looked up your whole history and I&rsquo;ll
make you tell it to the jury, with your own lips. It won&rsquo;t
help the defendant any, believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Mrs. Holmes faintly
demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You understand plain English. You&rsquo;ll hear a lot of
it if you maintain this attitude.&rdquo; There was a pause.
&ldquo;You must have some affection for this&mdash;this
&lsquo;son&rsquo; of yours. That&rsquo;s nothing more than animal
nature! But the more lies you tell, the more the jury will believe
in the story you told me and swore to; the more firmly you will
convince them that you are swearing falsely to save your
illegitimate child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. If I don&rsquo;t do what you say you&rsquo;ll tell
all about&mdash;Jerry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you! Exactly! I&rsquo;d like to spare you both,
but&mdash;&rdquo; the speaker shrugged. &ldquo;Better grit your
teeth and go through with it. You can&rsquo;t save him, no matter
what you do.&rdquo; With these words Vogel left.</p>

<p>Hazel Woods was surprised late that night to receive a telephone
request to come at once to the hotel where Mrs. Holmes was
stopping. On account of the hour, she took old Jacob Riggs with
her. She had taken Jacob about with her a good deal this past week,
not merely as an escort, but also because he displayed such
pathetic eagerness to comfort and to protect her. In these troubled
circumstances she was grateful for sympathy and faith from whatever
source, and of all her friends he alone remained loyal; he was
indeed a father. He was, if possible, &ldquo;queerer&rdquo; than
ever, more given to melancholy quotations from the Bible;
nevertheless she had a tender feeling for him and her misfortune
had drawn them close together.</p>

<p>Hazel found a number of reporters waiting in the hotel lobby and
was surprised to learn that Mrs. Holmes had likewise sent for them.
Her surprise deepened, hope stirred, when the two attorneys she had
hired for Jerry hurried in, explaining that they, too, had been
summoned. It was quite a group that finally rode upstairs and filed
into the sick woman&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes was up and dressed, but she looked desperately ill.
As soon as her visitors had disposed of themselves she began, in a
voice harsh and purposeful:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get out your pencils, boys. There&rsquo;s another
&lsquo;big&rsquo; story coming. I had a talk with Mr. Vogel today
and told him I had made a false affidavit. I told him my account of
the Ethridge murder was a pure invention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The correspondents exchanged glances, the attorneys leaned
forward eagerly. Hazel felt old Jacob&rsquo;s bony fingers upon her
arm and heard him mutter some scriptural phrase of
thanksgiving.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to tell you the whole truth and I want
you to print it. I sent for Jerry&rsquo;s lawyers so they can have
it put down in proper form and I can swear to it. I don&rsquo;t
know how such things ought to be done, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Go ahead,&rdquo; one of the attorneys
urged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start at the beginning and go along in my own
way. Please don&rsquo;t interrupt me&mdash;you can straighten it
out later. Well, then, I did see an automobile with one headlight
pass my house that night&mdash;I was waiting for Jerry&mdash;and it
stopped in the pine grove up by the lane. But that&rsquo;s all I
actually saw. I didn&rsquo;t see the murder; I didn&rsquo;t see the
car come back. I don&rsquo;t know when it came back, for I never
stepped outside my door after Jerry told me good night. After he
left I went to bed. I heard some shots, but I didn&rsquo;t know
Amos Ethridge had been killed until the next morning. As soon as I
heard about it I hurried up there and hung around all day.
That&rsquo;s the truth, so help me God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A question or two was voiced, but the woman did not answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I talked to some of you boys that morning and told you
all I knew, but you went out of your way to treat me
contemptuously&mdash;make fun of me. I was furious when I saw your
stories. . . . When I was on the stage I used to get a great thrill
out of interviews; I was crazy for publicity. People in my
profession frequently get that way. I loved to see my name in
print. I saved every notice, every criticism; I collected thousands
of clippings and preserved them. It&rsquo;s a mild form of disease
and lots of actors have it, for they&rsquo;re always playing to an
audience. . . . I&rsquo;ve been acting all my life, on the stage,
at home, before my friends, to myself. When you&rsquo;re in print,
you&rsquo;re acting in a way, only to a different audience. When I
lost my voice I lost my audience. That was the hardest thing to
bear. I used to think I was the most tragic figure in the world,
but&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker smiled bitterly&mdash;&ldquo;I guess
it was largely because I never saw my name in print, never heard it
mentioned any more. What is a career except&mdash;applause? What
does a person get out of it except food for his vanity? I&rsquo;m
telling you this to explain what happened next, for if you
don&rsquo;t understand the sort of person I am&mdash;the theatrical
temperament&mdash;you won&rsquo;t be able to understand what I
did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, after I got over my first resentment at being
ridiculed, the old disease came back. It pleased me to be written
about and to have my words quoted, even though you called me the
&lsquo;goose woman,&rsquo; &lsquo;a bedraggled old hag,&rsquo;
&lsquo;a drunken harridan.&rsquo; When I realized how far I&rsquo;d
gone back a lot of dead hopes and ambitions came to life. Embers I
thought were cold. . . . The &lsquo;goose woman&rsquo;! It&rsquo;s
a good name for me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All at once I dropped out of the papers entirely. I got
no more thrills; had nothing to think about, nothing to occupy me;
I had to quit acting. I was awfully lonely. I&rsquo;d had a taste
of the drug: the habit was back on me fiercer than ever, if you
know what I mean. . . . I dare say after this you can follow my
motives. I pieced out a story to fit my theory of the killing,
studied the ground so as not to contradict myself, planted an old
glove&mdash;It was very simple; it looked perfectly easy; I
didn&rsquo;t think I was doing harm to anybody for I felt sure the
murder would never be solved and I was merely bringing Maria di
Nardi back to life&mdash;laying roses on a forgotten shrine. I
don&rsquo;t know and I don&rsquo;t care who killed Amos Ethridge.
Whoever did it had a good reason, no doubt, for he was a bad
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Vogel believed me. He brought me here, put me up,
dressed me up, and I got so I believed my own story. It was
wonderful to &lsquo;come back,&rsquo; to creep out of my shell and
become Maria di Nardi again, even though it was all make-believe.
There&rsquo;s a crab&mdash;the hermit crab&mdash;that does
something like that. He&rsquo;s an ugly, soft, misshapen thing, but
he crawls into empty shells, beautiful shells, the owners of which
have died, and he lives there. . . . I had a glorious time in my
new, beautiful shell until I realized that I had put a noose around
my boy&rsquo;s neck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mary Holmes fell silent. Nobody spoke for a moment; then
somebody inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did Vogel say when you told him this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said I was lying to save Jerry and he had expected
something of the sort. Then he threatened me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Threatened you?&rdquo; It was one of the lawyers
speaking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&ldquo;Yes. He&rsquo;s holding something over me. Now that
I&rsquo;ve defied him, I&rsquo;ve got to tell you what it
is&mdash;that means telling the whole world&mdash;and it
isn&rsquo;t easy even for a &lsquo;bedraggled old harridan&rsquo;
like me. You see&mdash;I was never married! . . . Well gentlemen,
there you have the whole story. Mr. Vogel doesn&rsquo;t believe it,
but you do, don&rsquo;t you? And the public will believe it. Why,
you must <em>know</em> I&rsquo;m telling the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker stared eagerly at first one then another of her
hearers. One of the older men answered her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It makes no difference, Mrs. Holmes, what we fellows
think. We&rsquo;re trained not to think, but to get the news.
We&rsquo;ll send out this story, if you say so, but are you sure
you want us to? Will it do any good?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&mdash;<em>don&rsquo;t</em> believe
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s put it this way: we don&rsquo;t think the
public will believe you. The circumstantial evidence is too strong
and you haven&rsquo;t really destroyed any part of it. Am I right,
boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of assent and Mrs. Holmes read in the faces
before her a unanimity of opinion that dismayed her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll swear to it,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sworn to one story&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dimly the woman realized that the promptings of that mother love
which had finally assumed shape within her, instead of saving her
son had merely served to completely discredit her, and if anything
to lessen her chance of assisting him. Again she experienced that
wretched feeling of impotence, of frustration. With this feeling
the animal in her came to life, blazed into fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you fools! You idiots!&rdquo; she stammered
shrilly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re doing your best to make a murderess of
me. And so is Vogel. But you shan&rsquo;t. He&rsquo;s my boy!
I&rsquo;m a bad woman. I&rsquo;ve been a bad mother to him, but
he&rsquo;s fine and clean and&mdash;you shan&rsquo;t hurt him.
He&rsquo;s a genius; he has my talents and his father&rsquo;s.
It&rsquo;s not his fault that I&rsquo;m a vain, selfish old&mdash;
<em>He</em> didn&rsquo;t send me to the dogs! Publish my story,
every word of it! D&rsquo;you hear? It&rsquo;s the truth and
I&rsquo;ll fight you. I&rsquo;ll fight Vogel. You shan&rsquo;t hurt
him. You <em>shan&rsquo;t!</em> He&rsquo;s
mine&mdash;mine&mdash;&rdquo; Her voice, which had risen steadily,
cracked, became an incoherent cry of anguish. With her clenched
fists she pounded weakly at the arms of her chair and her face was
horribly distorted.</p>

<p>Efforts to calm her hysteria were futile. Somebody hurried for a
glass of water. One of the attorneys drew Hazel aside and tried to
tell her something, but she understood nothing of what he said, for
her own agitation equaled that of Gerald&rsquo;s mother. She clung
to the old doorman at her side, sobbing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jacob! Jacob! It&rsquo;s too late. Nobody&rsquo;s going
to believe her.&rdquo; The confusion abated somewhat. A man was
telephoning for the house doctor and the reporters were preparing
to leave, when Jacob Riggs stepped forward and spoke to Mrs.
Holmes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take on so, Miz&rsquo; Holmes.
Jerry&rsquo;s innocent and I ain&rsquo;t going to let anything
happen to him. I know how you feel. It&rsquo;s the same with me and
Hazel. She was given to me as a daughter, and according to Ruth
&lsquo;a daughter is better than seven sons.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Woods turned her tear-stained face towards the speaker; men
who were leaving paused to listen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Lord struck down Amos Ethridge, for he was an
evil-doer and he delighted in his wickedness. But Jerry
wasn&rsquo;t His instrument. He used Jacob, the son of Isaac.
Ethridge was a prince of the country like Shechem, the son of
Hamor. He saw Jacob&rsquo;s daughter and he took her and his soul
clave unto her. The Bible tells you what Jacob done. Jacob slew him
and the Lord was pleased and He told Jacob to arise and go up
to&mdash;to somewhere and build an altar. If Vogel and the
policemen had read their Bibles they&rsquo;d know who killed Amos
Ethridge, the son of Hamor, for it&rsquo;s all written down. The
proof&rsquo;s there. They can&rsquo;t blame Jerry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Hazel inquired,
sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m</em> Jacob!&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s
answer was broadcast to all his listeners. A peculiar resonance
crept into his voice as he quoted: &ldquo; &lsquo;Break thou the
arm of the evil man&rsquo;! He wrought folly in lying with
Jacob&rsquo;s daughter and I slew him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Jacob!</em>&rdquo; the girl wailed. She hid her face
in her trembling hands, for now she understood. To think that even
he believed her guilty!</p>

<p>The others were slower, but they, too, finally grasped what it
was the old doorman was trying to tell them. They shot questions at
him; they scribbled down his answers. Some one dashed to the
telephone and put in a call for Vogel. Mary Holmes strained
forward, clutching at Jacob&rsquo;s arm; her lips were moving, her
eyes were riveted upon his face.</p>

<p>Stripped of its garbled Biblical quotations, the old
fellow&rsquo;s story was simple and easy to follow, and it bespoke
a mind deranged but not wholly unhinged&mdash;the mind of a
religious fanatic. Not one of his hearers doubted the truth of his
words.</p>

<p>He loved Hazel and he had mistrusted Ethridge; he had moved out
to her house in order to watch over her. What he saw had awakened
in him a great anger, but he could not make up his mind what to do
about it until inspiration came from his reading. He was Jacob, and
Jacob, so he read, slew the son of Hamor for the same sin that
Ethridge had done. As a mark of approval, God had revealed himself
to the slayer and had made him great. Once the doorman had realized
that this was a divine command, peace came to his soul and he
calmly prepared to obey. He bought a revolver&mdash;Jacob told
where and when&mdash;and on the Thursday night Ethridge had called
on Hazel he took the trolley, rode to the end of the line, and laid
in wait at a spot where nothing could intervene to prevent him from
doing the will of God. But he wore no robe and no disguise. When he
had killed Ethridge he laid a cross upon the body and prayed over
it, then he trudged all the way back to town&mdash;the electric
cars had ceased running by that time. At the first bridge on the
way back he had dropped his revolver into the stream. Jacob
described the exact spot and said the weapon could easily be
recovered.</p>

<p>That was about all. He voiced no regrets; on the contrary, he
was genuinely exalted and it was plain that he anticipated no
punishment whatever for having done God&rsquo;s bidding.</p>

<p>Vogel arrived in due time. He listened attentively to what was
told him, then he questioned the old man searchingly. After a while
he and Jerry&rsquo;s lawyers left, taking Jacob with them. The
newspaper men had gone some time before.</p>

<p>Hazel would have followed them, for she reasoned that Jerry
would soon be at liberty and would naturally come directly here,
but Mrs. Holmes was wretchedly unstrung and implored her to remain,
for a while at least. It was impossible to desert a woman so
genuinely in need of assistance until she had time to pull herself
together, so the girl stayed.</p>

<p>A really noticeable change had come over Gerald&rsquo;s mother.
The process of voluntarily stripping bare her soul and exposing it
to the light had served the purpose of cleansing it and purifying
it to some extent. She showed it in her words, her actions, in the
apprehension she displayed at the prospect of meeting her son. She
wondered if he would be harsh with her. She made pitiful,
fluttering attempts to better her appearance, but her recent ordeal
had left her almost helpless and Hazel was compelled to do the work
of her hands.</p>

<p>Jerry arrived before the girl could escape&mdash;Vogel, it
seemed, was capable of cutting red tape when he felt like it. He
entered the room, breathless, radiant. Without a word, except the
one cry, &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; he ran to Mary Holmes&rsquo;s chair
and knelt beside it. Hungrily she put her arms about him, pressed
him to her breast. Her face was glorified with an expression it had
never worn before. Its grossness was burned away and in its place
shone a suggestion at least of the beauty that had been Maria di
Nardi&rsquo;s. She crooned over her boy, she patted and she petted
him, she stroked his hair and kissed it.</p>

<p>Hazel looked on through a mist of tears. She resisted blindly
when, after a while, Jerry rose and took her two hands in his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They told me how you stood by us,&rdquo; she heard him
saying. &ldquo;How you hired those lawyers for me and
everything.&rdquo; He ran on with something more, something about
demented old Jacob and the necessity of making sure that no
punishment was visited upon him, but Hazel understood little
because of the roaring in her ears.</p>

<p>Of course Jerry was grateful, she had expected nothing less. She
assumed, however, that this meeting must be as distressing to him
as to her, and she blamed herself for inflicting this unnecessary
pain upon them.</p>

<p>Mary Holmes fathomed the cause of the girl&rsquo;s peculiar
agitation and it indicated the change that had occurred in the
older woman when she forgot herself and her own concerns
sufficiently to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jerry, dear, we owe everything to this child. She did as
much for me as for you. And yet she wants to run away! If you can
forgive me for what I&rsquo;ve done you can surely forgive
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he has n-nothing to forgive,&rdquo; sobbed the girl.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it. You don&rsquo;t understand. Nobody
understands. If I were guilty I&rsquo;d deserve punishment, but
I&rsquo;m not. They called me a scarlet woman; they preached
sermons about me; they lied and slandered&mdash;and they
didn&rsquo;t give me a chance to defend myself! Even old Jacob
believed&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jerry&rsquo;s voice rose above her heartbroken cry and its tone
more than his words quieted her. &ldquo;I never believed it. Why,
if I had doubted you, for an instant, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d
have had the courage to endure what I went through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Honestly?</em>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The young man nodded. In a strangled voice the girl cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got to hear the real truth. Mr.
Ethridge may have been a bad man, but he was good to me. Perhaps he
had&mdash;ideas about me at first. I dare say he had, but he
learned to know me and to respect me. He said he loved me; anyhow
he asked me to marry him, and I can show you his letters to prove
it. That wouldn&rsquo;t convince other people, but <em>you</em>
know he wasn&rsquo;t the sort of man to marry a girl he
couldn&rsquo;t respect. You <em>know</em> that don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. But even if it had been&mdash;otherwise, it
wouldn&rsquo;t have made any great difference so long as you had
learned to truly care for me. You taught me something about
charity. You proved to me that nothing matters very much if two
people really love each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Holmes nodded vigorously. &ldquo;Good boy, Jerry! I&rsquo;m
glad you&rsquo;re a man! She&rsquo;s a dear, foolish girl. She
thinks she oughtn&rsquo;t to marry you&mdash;afraid she
can&rsquo;t live this down. But, pshaw! Young people like you can
live anything down. The world forgets. It forgot Maria di Nardi and
it will forget the girl in the Ethridge case. Maybe it will even
forget the &lsquo;goose woman,&rsquo; if she behaves herself.
She&rsquo;s going to behave herself. She&rsquo;s an old derelict
and&mdash;But, for that matter, we&rsquo;re all three derelicts!
Isn&rsquo;t it better for us to drift together than to drift apart?
Certainly! Afraid she&rsquo;ll ruin your career! Humph! Why,
she&rsquo;ll make it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mother ceased speaking, for she realized that neither Jerry
nor Hazel were listening to her. They were standing close together
and looking into each other&rsquo;s eyes; they were quite oblivious
to her presence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="CaveStuff" id=

</h1>

<p>His name was Marcel and he was a valet. He came to Nome as
Colonel Waldo&rsquo;s &ldquo;man.&rdquo; That was the spring after
Waldo put over his big Saw Tooth Hydraulic proposition in New York
and was in sufficient funds to afford luxuries. As for Marcel, it
was the first time he had ever stepped his No. 7 double-A&rsquo;s
off of hard pavements; it was his first acquaintance with what he
called &ldquo;the life of the raw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not a phrase of Marcel&rsquo;s coining; he got it out
of an Alaskan romance he read on the way north. He read several
such stories and they caused his eyes to bulge, his heart to
flutter. From them he discovered that it was a savage country into
which he was going and he wondered if his nerves would endure the
constant shooting. He did not like shooting; unexpected noises of
any sort startled him and caused him to drop things.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, Marcel had come to Alaska by reason of a
geographical misapprehension, for nothing on earth would have
induced him to accept a position in the wilds of the uncharted
north if he had known what he was doing. When Waldo had offered to
engage him he had explained to the Frenchman that the job would
entail a trip across the continent and a summer of roughing it, but
Marcel had no idea where Alaska was located or what it was like.
The names of these American provinces and departments were
confusing; they were all barbaric and strange. He had tried to
remember this one long enough to look it up in a borrowed
encyclopedia and he believed that he had done so. What he read had
reassured him:</p>

<p class="note">Population, 1900, 1,066,300. Principal cities,
Omaha, Lincoln, South Omaha, etc., etc.</p>

<p>One certain paragraph he had not liked so well. It read
thus:</p>

<p class="note">Fauna.&mdash;The large mammals are almost extinct.
The bison does not occur wild. Elk, deer, and antelope are very
rare, but in the western part of Nebraska there are many of the
smaller animals such as wild cats, wolves, coyotes, and foxes.
Twenty-three species of reptiles are found, none poisonous except
three species of rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>Marcel had turned from reading this with a shudder, only to note
something else which caused his eyes to brighten:</p>

<p class="note">Flora.&mdash;The state is the meeting-ground for
the floras of the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi Valley. In
all there are more than 2,700 species. . . .</p>

<p>That was another matter! With his taste in clothes and over
thirty neckties to choose from, Marcel had gayly promised himself
that it would be a bad summer for those Rocky Mountain Floras.
Enthusiastically he had pictured them: sturdy, fair-skinned,
broad-hipped, deep-bosomed Amazons. Twenty-seven hundred varieties
to choose from. Astonishing! But this America! So rich in beauty!
&ldquo;One peepin of a country.&rdquo; There would be
&ldquo;somethings doing&rdquo; when Marcel Labaudie burst upon the
delighted vision of those Nebraska ladies.</p>

<p>He took the position.</p>

<p>It was not until he and the colonel had sailed from Seattle that
Marcel discovered his error; then it was that he talked to his
fellow travelers, consulted the ship&rsquo;s library. Then it was
that the hideous truth revealed itself. He could have shrieked.</p>

<p>But as he read about the &ldquo;broad open spaces,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the sturdy vikings of the north,&rdquo; &ldquo;the fair
daughters of the snows,&rdquo; etc., a change came over him. He
felt a subdued thrill, the first timid stirrings of an unfamiliar
excitement. After all, this was a colossal adventure, and every
man, even a valet, should experience at least one adventure.</p>

<p>Adventure came promptly. It came to Marcel even before he set
foot upon Alaska&rsquo;s golden strand. The ship wallowed up to her
anchorage abreast of Nome at the tail end of a sou&rsquo;easter. A
brisk breeze was still blowing and the distant beach was a milky
line of surf. The landing of passengers appeared to be out of the
question.</p>

<p>But Colonel Waldo was a restless man. Telegrams were awaiting
him; work on the Saw Tooth ditch was under way. He had a talk with
the captain and a lifeboat was put over.</p>

<p>Marcel watched the perilous procedure with detached, impersonal
interest. The reckless courage of those seamen excited his
admiration and caused him momentarily to forget his miserable
&gt;mal de mer. The boat plunged and thrashed; at one moment it
rose almost to the level of the sloping deck where Marcel weakly
clung, at the next it fell away into a watery chasm of dizzying
depth; it was in constant danger of being smashed against the
dripping steel sides of the Leviathan. Marcel closed his eyes, it
nauseated him to watch it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come along. Grab my dispatch case. We&rsquo;ve got no
time to lose.&rdquo; It was the colonel speaking.</p>

<p>Marcel followed his employer, clutched the door jamb of his
stateroom for support, and inquired: &ldquo;Pardon? You were
spikking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going ashore in that lifeboat. Can&rsquo;t
wait. Our stuff&rsquo;ll be off to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; Marcel exclaimed, faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right! Impossible&mdash;to wait.&rdquo; The colonel was
an active, ruddy man; he grinned as he inquired:
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Scared?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of a certainty! And I am sissick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the more reason to get ashore. Hurry up.&rdquo; With
fingers suddenly grown numb and nerveless Marcel buttoned his
overcoat to the chin, set his derby hat more firmly upon his head,
and took up the dispatch case. He never argued with an employer. It
was not done.</p>

<p>He could never recall just how he got into that lifeboat, but
for days later he had a horrid, nightmarish memory of clinging to a
slippery ladder with nothing beneath him except the boisterous,
bottomless sea. At one moment he was suspended at an enormous
height above it and he swooned with terror, at the next that
frightful ocean rushed upward to engulf him and he swung out, away
from the ship, like a plumb-bob. Somewhere beneath him was the
boat. He heard Colonel Waldo yell at him to jump; he closed his
eyes, released all holds, and kicked himself away from the
ladder.</p>

<p>He landed with a crash. He was bruised and shaken; cold salt
spray was blowing over him. But the dispatch case was still
clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>The Nome life-saving crew were on the beach and quite a crowd
from Front Street had assembled to see the lifeboat land through
the surf. Marcel had assumed that all danger was past, that his
great adventure had come and had passed gloriously, but the thunder
of those breakers, those excited onlookers, those men in shiny
boots and oilskins rushing back and forth along the shore, caused
his heart to stop beating. He could see nothing but destruction
ahead. Alas! he had journeyed five thousand miles to die twice in
one day! These mad Americans! Life for them was one attempt at
suicide after another!</p>

<p>Marcel uttered a cry of fright, for the lifeboat&rsquo;s rush
through the surf was halted; it seemed to stop, to be sucked
backward into the maw of a devouring wave, then it was swamped,
crushed beneath an avalanche of icy water. After that, chaos!
Marcel felt himself drowning, and the sensation was much worse than
he had believed it. For one thing, it was much colder. He had been
flung out of the boat into a welter of foam, a maelstrom of oars,
of thrashing arms and kicking legs. And he could not swim. The sea
picked him up, threw him down, swallowed him entirely, vomited him
out. He strangled. He inhaled salt water and sand into his
lungs.</p>

<p>He found himself being dragged up the beach finally; huge
calloused hands were slapping him on the back, squeezing the brine
out of him, kneading him, wringing him out like a wet sock. His
fingers were still locked into the strap of Colonel Waldo&rsquo;s
dispatch case. The colonel was in scarcely better plight than he.
Other people were working over him, shaking hands with him. Among
the latter were several women. The colonel was laughing loudly,
boisterously. He was demented, no doubt. Marcel decided that this
hideous escapade had unseated the poor man&rsquo;s reason. No
wonder. He felt certain that most of these strangers were
maniacs.</p>

<p>An hour later (Marcel and his employer had found lodgings in a
hotel and had thoroughly dried themselves out) the colonel eyed his
valet shrewdly and said with a grin:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That water was a trifle cold, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marcel paled and shuddered. &ldquo;At the least it was ten
degrees beneath zero,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind of a rough landing for a tenderfoot, I&rsquo;ll
admit. But what do you think of the place, so far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With genuine admiration the Frenchman exclaimed: &ldquo;I am
amaze&rsquo;! Every place I look is women and children! To think
all those pipple have sweemed in that cold ocean to arrive here.
Thousan&rsquo;s mus&rsquo; have perish&rsquo;! &gt;Mon dieu! The
Floras of those Rocksy Mountains are nothing to the brave wifes
an&rsquo; mothers of Alaska.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was typical of Marcel&rsquo;s state of mind. Alaska, its
climate, its scenery, its people, its customs, all were so foreign
to anything he had experienced that nothing surprised him.
Everything was phenomenal. He was a man from Mars and he moved upon
a strange planet peopled with unique inhabitants. And he was
likewise a phenomenon to them. He was the first valet Alaska had
ever seen; each was a revelation to the other. To him the Alaskans
were all that the books had described&mdash;a race of supermen; to
them he was&mdash;well, they could not quite classify him. Cooks,
longshoremen, roustabouts, bartenders, waiters, all were familiar
types and the north accepted them on broad and tolerant terms of
equality, for the mere nature of a person&rsquo;s employment
mattered little and no form of honest labor is degrading,
but&mdash;a valet! The species was new and unfamiliar. Men studied
Marcel with the same grave and earnest curiosity they would have
examined an interesting beetle.</p>

<p>Atlin Joe Billings, head teamster for the Saw Tooth outfit,
summarized pretty accurately the Nome idea of Marcel when he
confessed to his fellow employees:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a new bird to me an&rsquo; I thought I&rsquo;d
seen &rsquo;em all. I&rsquo;ve seen cowgirls an&rsquo; male
sopranners, female bank robbers an&rsquo; men dressmakers, but I
never before seen a housemaid with hair on her chest. He&rsquo;s a
kind of he hired girl. Mind you, I don&rsquo;t kick how a guy earns
his pay check&mdash;I&rsquo;ve stirred blankets in a bunk-house
an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done dishes in a quick-an&rsquo;-dirty,
myself&mdash;but there&rsquo;s some jobs that ain&rsquo;t of the
masculine tense. Foldin&rsquo; underclothes an&rsquo; handin&rsquo;
socks to a gentleman that&rsquo;s strong enough to reach &rsquo;em
himself is one. No, a bedroom ain&rsquo;t no workshop for a man.
But he ain&rsquo;t a bad little Frog, at that, an&rsquo; I kinda
like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Everybody liked Marcel, for he was eager to make friends and his
mind was thirsty. He hung with inordinate interest upon every word
that was said to him. These brawny, sunbrowned men with their boots
and their mackinaws, with their robust laughter and their scowling
passions, were demigods to him; they were conquerors of a land so
wild, so hostile that it filled him with awe and apprehension. When
a demigod is worshiped by a mere mortal he treats that mortal
kindly.</p>

<p>Atlin Joe Billings was in Marcel&rsquo;s eyes the ideal type of
superman that he had read about. He fascinated the little
Frenchman, awoke his deepest respect and his utmost envy. To be a
man like that!</p>

<p>Atlin possessed a jocose spirit and, finding that no statement
was too exaggerated, no lie too outrageous, for Marcel to swallow,
he fed him upon both.</p>

<p>For example, Marcel suffered from a troublesome corn&mdash;he
would wear shoes too small for him&mdash;and one day when Atlin
inquired why he was limping he revealed the cause.</p>

<p>The teamster was instantly all sympathy, and naturally, since
he, himself, had endured such agony from corns as to practically
undermine his health. Would Marcel believe him when he said that he
had counted at one time over eighty corns upon his poor, screaming
feet? Marcel would, he did believe anything Atlin told him. But
Atlin had cured himself. How? Simply by chilling the corn microbes
until they scattered, fled. He had walked from Circle City to
Dawson barefooted over the ice and had never known a sick day
since. The relief was unbelievable and now his feet were so hardy
that he could tread on broken bottles or kick a hole through a
board fence in his socks. What was more, he had cured thousands of
corns for his friends and he would cure Marcel.</p>

<p>The Saw Tooth outfit was in camp by this time, and in a
depression back of the cook-tent was a late snowdrift which the sun
had not yet melted. Thither Atlin led Marcel. He took a candle box
with him and this he arranged for his friend to sit upon. When the
latter had removed shoes and stockings he was told to bury his feet
in the wet snow and keep them buried as long as they felt
comfortable. A few simple daily treatments like this and Marcel
would be surprised. Atlin offered to fetch him something to read,
but when Marcel said that he did not believe he felt like reading,
the teamster brought some of the other boys and they all sat around
and watched the cure. Marcel, by this time, was patting his naked
soles upon the snow much as a pipe organist treads the foot keys of
his instrument, so the onlookers told jokes to divert his
attention, and, although he could not understand them, they were
very funny jokes, for the men laughed immoderately. They were
genial, good-hearted fellows to take such an interest in him.</p>

<p>Marcel followed out this treatment religiously for several days
and, if anything, public interest in it increased. Then he
developed chilblains. This caused quite an argument, and Atlin
finally acknowledged with reluctance that snow did not have the
same curative effect upon corns as did ice. Ice, he stoutly
maintained, was the death of them, due, no doubt, to the action of
the ice worms.</p>

<p>Ice worms! Marcel had never heard of such a thing, but forthwith
the teamster enlightened him. Marcel had surely noticed the thin,
threadlike lines and microscopic perforations in certain chunks of
ice? They were bored by ice worms. Nature had made the ice worm
transparent, Atlin explained, in order to protect it from its
enemies. They made nourishing soup, if properly prepared, and had
much the flavor of snails. But it was all in the cooking. Atlin had
learned the secret from the Indians, and one winter when his bacon
went bad he had lived exclusively on ice worms. One boiled the ice
in which the worms were imbedded until they fell out, then strained
off the liquid. But one couldn&rsquo;t boil it too long or of
course the ice would melt.</p>

<p>Many odd and valuable things like this the eager Frenchman
learned from his friend. He learned, for instance, that the Aurora
Borealis is visible only on Friday nights, and that the reason a
side-hill gouger has two short legs on its left side and two long
legs on its right side is so that it can graze in comfort on steep
mountain slopes. If Marcel should ever have the misfortune to meet
one of these monsters he was warned never to try to escape by
fleeing from left to right along the hillside. No, he must run from
right to left. Then, of course, the animal would be unable to
pursue him. On level ground the gouger is likewise practically
helpless, for its deformity compels it to run in circles.</p>

<p>He was informed, too, that Eskimo babies are reared on
whale&rsquo;s milk and that Uncle Sam supplies submarine milkers
from the Mare Island Navy-yard to keep the little dears in
food.</p>

<p>Much of Atlin&rsquo;s humor was good natured, but not all of it.
He was a hard teamster and sometimes he whipped his horses
unnecessarily. Sometimes, also, he took a cruel delight in causing
Marcel unnecessary humiliation and even pain. Marcel, having had no
acquaintance with practical jokes, never for a moment blamed his
big friend, but Colonel Waldo, who was wise in the ways of the
north, warned Atlin privately, but with firmness, that the pranks
would have to stop. As a result Marcel had a much pleasanter time
of it&mdash;until the Dahlgren girl arrived.</p>

<p>Old man Dahlgren, her father, was the storekeeper and, being a
thrifty soul, he got a job for his daughter waiting on table for
the office force. Atlin brought her out from town and Marcel
experienced an electric thrill at his first sight of her, for she
was a sturdy, fair-skinned, broadhipped, deep-bosomed Amazon. Her
hair was like corn silk, her eyes were as blue as the sea; she had
a wide mouth and when she smiled two deep dimples magically
appeared in her cheeks. She smiled too often, by the way;
nevertheless, it was a friendly smile and well calculated to work
havoc in a construction camp. She turned it upon dapper little
Marcel, even while Atlin, with jealous and exaggerated courtesy,
was helping her down off the freight wagon, and Marcel was
profoundly moved. His back stiffened, his chest swelled, he twirled
into sharper points his tiny, pomaded mustache, and when she had
disappeared into the store, he inquired breathlessly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; Atlin! &gt;Who is those beautiful
lady?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mushoo Marcel!&rdquo; the teamster mimicked.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s Dahlgren&rsquo;s daughter, Flora.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flora! Her name was Flora! &gt;&ldquo;Some bebe!&rdquo;
Ecstatically Marcel plucked a kiss from his lips and snapped it
after her. &ldquo;I am ravish&rsquo; wit&rsquo; her! She
is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hell you are!&rdquo; Atlin scowled at the speaker.
&ldquo;Looka here, Mercy Beaukoo, her an&rsquo; me decided on the
way out to ball up thicker&rsquo;n a lot of angleworms&mdash;that
is, I decided&mdash;&rdquo; Atlin&rsquo;s face slowly cleared.
&ldquo;You spoke it! I mean to say she &gt;is some baby! An&rsquo;
she&rsquo;s bound to take a great interest in you, Marcel. I bet
she never seen a real, live, high-class val&gt;ay before. Her
an&rsquo; you are goin&rsquo; to run together just like so much
axle grease an&rsquo; water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the team had unloaded, Marcel strolled into the store and
there found Miss Dahlgren waiting for her father to finish checking
off the newly arrived provisions. With a flourish he introduced
himself to the new arrival and bade her welcome.</p>

<p>Miss Dahlgren flushed and dimpled. It was gratifying to be so
cordially received by an important official of the Company. Mr.
Labaudie certainly dressed well and had charming manners, but he
was an awful cut-up. Fancy kissing a girl&rsquo;s hand, five
minutes after meeting her! But foreigners were like that; you never
knew what they&rsquo;d try next. He had nice eyes and she was glad
he adored blondes&mdash;it would render her work that much easier.
But such a way as he had with him! Not exactly fresh&mdash;no, he
was too sincere for that. Personally, Flora liked fiery people, so
long as they were sincere, and it was a relief to meet a gentleman
in a white shirt and a derby hat after all these roustabouts. There
was no doubt about Mr. Labaudie&rsquo;s sincerity, for he kissed
her hand a second time and pressed it. Of course he could call her
Flora&mdash;everybody called her Flora. My! but he got on fast! You
had to watch men with mustaches like his.</p>

<p>When old man Dahlgren had finished with his work and Marcel had
bade her a graceful but passionate adieu until supper time, Flora
asked her father just who it was that she had been talking
with.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? &gt;Him? That&rsquo;s Marcel, Colonel Waldo&rsquo;s
&lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;s gentleman.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s a &lsquo;gentleman&rsquo;s gentleman,&rsquo;
pa?&rdquo; the girl inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a val<em>a</em>y. He darns the
boss&rsquo;s socks and keeps his pants pressed and carries hot
water for his bathtub. &gt;You know&mdash;kind of a buck
chambermaid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Dahlgren. After a
moment she added. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice little fellow, at
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her father nodded. &ldquo;Sure! We like him fine. That&rsquo;s
the funny part of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marcel returned to his living quarters, changed into his best
suit, and selected the most becoming of his thirty neckties. With a
pair of sharp scissors he trimmed his mustache&mdash;a delicate
operation&mdash;and clipped his eyebrows. Then he steamed his face
with hot cloths and rubbed in a lilac-scented cream. When a man is
in love, when he has met the adorable queen of all the Rocky
Mountain Floras, he owes it to her to make himself as attractive as
possible. As a finishing touch to his toilet he doused himself with
perfume. Too bad he was denied the privilege of sitting at the
boss&rsquo;s table and taking food from her white hands&mdash;the
ditch men with whom he ate always commented in coarse language
whenever he used scents&mdash;but to-night this perfume would be a
tribute to her. Incense upon the altar of a goddess. And, anyhow,
she would smell him later.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Miss Dahlgren did not have the pleasure of
inhaling the permeating odor of musk which Marcel gave off, either
at supper time or later. The men smelled it, to be sure, and one of
them tore up a floor board, declaring there must be a skunk&rsquo;s
nest under the mess tent, but when the dishes were washed the new
queen enthroned herself upon the steps of the store with Atlin Joe
Billings and several others at her feet, and Marcel could not even
get within speaking distance of her.</p>

<p>Life in the Saw Tooth camp had been pleasant and harmonious up
to the arrival of Flora Dahlgren, but she proved to be an apple of
discord. Her ready smile induced several of the boys to make
reckless advances to her, with the result that Atlin clouded up and
poured all over them. He announced one day, as he bound up his
bruised knuckles with wet chewing tobacco, that he was the only
out-and-out ladies&rsquo; man on the Company&rsquo;s payroll and he
proposed to maintain that distinction. There was nobody left who
cared to argue the matter with him.</p>

<p>Despite Marcel&rsquo;s open worship of the camp divinity, Atlin
could not bring himself to be actually jealous of the little man,
for he told himself that no full-blooded, two-fisted dame like
Flora would fall for a valet. Nevertheless, he did go so far as to
warn the latter that he was particular what sort of people his
girls associated with, and that if he ever caught one talking to a
Frenchman he, Atlin Joe Billings, would make that Frenchman hunt a
gopher hole.</p>

<p>Marcel made inquiry and learned what a gopher hole is, then he
laughed at Atlin&rsquo;s absurd figure of speech. Why, for
instance, should he waste time searching for a gopher&rsquo;s
residence? Surely not for a hiding-place in which to escape the
teamster&rsquo;s wrath, for a grown man could not possibly
penetrate into the burrow of a ground squirrel! No! The American
language was beset with bewildering idioms.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as Atlin&rsquo;s duties took him away from camp during
the day, Marcel managed to see a good deal of Flora, but in spite
of all he could do his courtship did not prosper.</p>

<p>It was through her that he became aware, at last, of the odium
that attached to his occupation and of the unspoken prejudice
against him. He was incredulous, rather than hurt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why? The colonel will tell you that of all the valets
he has engage&rsquo; I render the mos&rsquo; perfect service. I am
his jewel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flora tried to explain just what she meant, but as a democratic
Alaskan she found it difficult to define nice social distinctions,
and the more she talked the less certain she was that she made
herself plain. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t exactly put it in words,
Marcel, except that being a valet somehow ain&rsquo;t a man-sized
job. A valet is a&mdash;a servant and you know there ain&rsquo;t
any servants in this country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are not all these pipple servants of Colonel
Waldo?&rdquo; Marcel inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Huh! I should say not. &gt;I&rsquo;m not a
servant.&rdquo; Miss Dahlgren turned up her nose. &ldquo;And say!
You better not let Atlin hear you call &gt;him a servant. Oh,
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am possess&rsquo; of such stupidy,&rdquo; confessed
the man. &ldquo;You wait behind the table; you rastle those grub
for the boss, as Atlin says, and shoot the biscuit! I feex him up
his clothes. What difference, eh? All right! I mak&rsquo; the
colonel&rsquo;s bed; Atlin mak&rsquo; bed for the colonel&rsquo;s
hosses. I swip his tent; Atlin clean him up the stable. For that he
is fine gentleman and I&rsquo;m servant! What you goin&rsquo; say
now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t going to say anything. It&rsquo;s kind of
foolish when you think of it, but there&rsquo;s lots of foolish
things in this world, and, anyhow, that&rsquo;s the way we look at
it. If you was a regular hired man and did a man&rsquo;s work
I&rsquo;d&mdash;it would be different. But&mdash;Why, for
instance, a girl couldn&rsquo;t &gt;marry a valet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Not unless she was a servant
girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It took quite a while for Marcel to grasp this peculiar attitude
of mind, and, although he could see no reason for it, he became
thoroughly unhappy, nevertheless. Flora, as near as he could
understand her, admired only big, brave men&mdash;men who took
orders for eight hours a day, but who acknowledged no master
thereafter. None but the reckless, primitive, forceful type of man
could win her, and Marcel acknowledged, ruefully, that those
qualities did not fit him. It was just as the books had said: none
but the cave-men returned with the bacon. He admired and envied the
husky teamster too sincerely to experience jealousy; instead, a
somber, brooding hopelessness settled upon him and he began to
avoid people.</p>

<p>One day he borrowed the colonel&rsquo;s 22-caliber rifle and
asked the latter to show him how to load and to fire it. The
colonel obliged him, and daily thereafter Marcel spent his off
hours wandering disconsolately about, popping at ptarmigan.</p>

<p>At first he could hit nothing, for he had never before aimed a
rifle, but he practiced assiduously and he learned to take careful,
unhurried sight at his targets and to hold his weapon steady. When
he finally killed a bird he became very proud. It was the first
blood he had ever shed, except with a safety razor, and he told
himself that he was becoming a genuine &ldquo;out-of-the-doors
man,&rdquo; after the American style. In time he surprised the cook
by bringing in quite a number of birds.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, odd to relate, Atlin&rsquo;s love-affair had fallen
out of joint. The blond Flora no longer appeared to derive complete
satisfaction from his exclusive society, and his wit awoke no
response from her beyond an occasional fretful complaint that he
was about as funny as a child&rsquo;s crutch. When he became
affectionate she likened him to a playful bull walrus and told him
irritably that there were such things as good manners, even in
men.</p>

<p>Atlin pondered the significance of this change. There was a
nigger in the woodpile somewhere&mdash;or a Frenchman. He could
scarcely credit the latter suspicion, but all the same he commenced
a systematic persecution of the valet. He did not show his dislike
to the world; on the contrary, he openly voiced his friendship, and
Marcel believed him. But those were unhappy days for the little
man. He was made ridiculous, made to suffer in every possible way.
He endured it all with a patient smile, a look of pained
bewilderment. It was the American way. Inwardly he bled.</p>

<p>Once he even allowed himself to be inveigled into a boxing
exhibition with Atlin. He protested that he knew nothing about
&ldquo;the rules of the box&rdquo; as practiced here: in the
&ldquo;gymnase&rdquo; at home boxers used their feet instead of
their hands. They kicked each other. This statement provoked a
shout of laughter.</p>

<p>Atlin promised not to hurt his little friend and playmate and
literally he kept his word. All he did was to toy with him,
sidestep his rushes, feint him into knots, rub the gloves in his
face, flick his nose with them. It was a side-splitting
performance, but when it was over and Marcel was alone he burst
into tears of mortification. If only the rules of the American box
permitted the kick of the feet! But no. He had made a fool of
himself, as usual, and Flora had looked on.</p>

<p>He was not angry at Atlin; he merely despised Marcel Labaudie,
the valet, the spineless, inept, incompetent servant. Oh, to be a
cave man.</p>

<p>One day word came to camp that over on Dog Salmon Creek a miner
had been mauled by a huge brown bear, and Colonel Waldo
&rsquo;phoned in to Nome, inviting some of his friends to join him
on a hunt. His invitation was eagerly accepted, for the great
Alaskan brown bear, an overgrown cousin of the Rocky Mountain
grizzly, is not common in the Nome section and is a trophy eagerly
sought after. There were five of these guests&mdash;business men
who welcomed this opportunity for a week&rsquo;s recreation.</p>

<p>Colonel Waldo ordered an outfit put together from the commissary
stores and directed Atlin to accompany the expedition as guide and
packer, a commission that delighted the latter. To Marcel he
confided:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, Beaukoo, this dude-wranglin&rsquo; is my dish. You
savvy why they&rsquo;re takin&rsquo; me along, don&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; Marcel did not savvy. &ldquo;Why, to do their
killin&rsquo; for &rsquo;em! There ain&rsquo;t a man in the party
could hit a mule in the rump with a spade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are then such a skillful marksman? What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I ain&rsquo;t absolutely unerrin&rsquo;,&rdquo; Atlin
modestly confessed. &ldquo;Of course I ain&rsquo;t never missed
nothin&rsquo; I ever shot at, yet, but you never know. If ever I do
miss a bear I promise you one thing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ear him down
an&rsquo; ride him into camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can perform those feat?&rdquo; Marcel was indeed
astonished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! A bear is scared of his shadder. All you gotta do
is be firm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;what the colonel means when he say that feller
is &lsquo;maul&rsquo; by a bear? &lsquo;Maul&rsquo;! She&rsquo;s
new word wit&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I done to you when we was boxin&rsquo;,
Frenchy. Bears is natural boxers. They like to dance, too.
You&rsquo;ve heard of dancin&rsquo; bears? They got &rsquo;em in
circuses. Why, I knew a feller up in Forty Mile one time that got
tied in with an old she bear with cubs, an&rsquo; she started to
waltz with him. He like to starved to death before he got shed of
her. They danced for more&rsquo;n a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary! &gt;Mon dieu! I would adore to be a
member of this party,&rdquo; Marcel breathed.</p>

<p>An hour later and he found that he was a member of the party,
for at the last minute Waldo drafted him as cook.</p>

<p>That expedition into the hills was an experience for the valet.
It was his first sight of the real wilderness. The trackless, open
valleys&mdash;broken by occasional thickets of willow and alder;
the treeless mountains brilliant here with acres of wild flowers,
scarred there by steep, naked slides where avalanches had hurled
themselves headlong from the heights; the peaceful meadows, belly
deep to a horse in lush grasses; the brawling streams and foaming
cataracts&mdash;all were new and amazing to Marcel.</p>

<p>And the rough life of the camp, it was full of delights. That
is, it would have been full of delights if he had been allowed time
in which to enjoy them, but he was kept on the jump from dawn until
dark. Colonel Waldo had provided the best for his guests and they
proceeded to enjoy it all to the full. It was, &ldquo;Marcel, do
this,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marcel, do that,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s
that leaping frog, Marcel?&rdquo; &ldquo;Marcel, fetch a bucket of
water,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hurry up with those dishes, Marcel, and make
my bed,&rdquo; &ldquo;Marcel, dry out my boots.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nobody turned a hand to help with the work, for what is a valet
for? Certainly valets have no feelings and require no sleep. The
little man worked until he was ready to drop. It was torture for
him to ride a horse, but that was about the only rest he got. Once
he fell asleep and tumbled out of his saddle, which deeply
embarrassed him. He uttered no complaint, however. This was that
free and invigorating &ldquo;life of the raw&rdquo; about which he
had heard so much. He knew now why they called it
&ldquo;raw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bear tracks were plentiful on Dog Salmon Creek and permanent
camp was pitched there. But the hunters had little success. They
rode out morning and afternoon, but were always back in time for
their meals. Even Atlin Joe had to be waited upon.</p>

<p>It was decided one morning to split up the party and go in
opposite directions, and Atlin suggested that Marcel go along with
him and his two companions, to hold their horses in case they saw
game. This the colonel agreed to.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can take my extra gun&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey, there!&rdquo; one of the sportsmen protested.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be shot in the back by a chattering
Frenchman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Marcel can use a rifle! I taught him to shoot my .22.
I&rsquo;d laugh if he got a crack at a bear and you fellows
didn&rsquo;t. Marcel, if you get a shot, take it. Take your time
and drop your bear if you can.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&gt;&ldquo;Oui, monsieur!&rdquo; The speaker smiled
deprecatingly. &ldquo;But I am no huntsman.&rdquo; Privately he
decided that nothing whatever would induce him to fire at a bear
and risk arousing in it a desire to dance with him.</p>

<p>It was not yet noon when Atlin halted his party and, with a
whistle of astonishment, pointed down at an indentation in the wet
moss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder&rsquo;s what I mean to call a &gt;bear
track!&rdquo; The hunters stared and nodded. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t
far ahead of us and he&rsquo;ll be layin&rsquo; down when it gets
hot. We don&rsquo;t want to jump him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never seen these grizzle bear,&rdquo; Marcel ventured.
&ldquo;What she&rsquo;s look like?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Atlin winked at his companions. &ldquo;&rsquo;Bout the size of a
dog, only greenish. You&rsquo;ll know one if you see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And meanwhile don&rsquo;t load that gun of yours,&rdquo;
one of the others said, nervously. &ldquo;You might tremble it
off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The party rode on for an hour or more. It was stupid sport,
Marcel decided. They stopped after a while and told him to hold the
horses while they went on afoot, and he was only too glad to get
out of the saddle. He waited interminably. It was early afternoon
when Atlin returned with the announcement:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we got him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No! I don&rsquo;t hear no shootin&rsquo;. You took him by
the ear, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We ain&rsquo;t killed him yet, but we got him all
surrounded up. He&rsquo;s hidin&rsquo;! Come on; we got a job for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marcel followed his long-legged friend for perhaps half a mile
until they came to a steep, bare hillside overlooking a tangle of
alders in the valley below. Then Atlin explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in them bushes, but it&rsquo;s too thick to
see to shoot. Mr. Thompson&rsquo;s over there on the other side,
an&rsquo; Hillker&rsquo;s down by them big bowlders. We got the
place ringed around, so all you gotta do is go in there quiet
an&rsquo; scare him out. We&rsquo;ll get him, sure; he ain&rsquo;t
got a chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You jokin&rsquo; wit&rsquo; me?&rdquo; Marcel inquired,
suspiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? &gt;Me? He&rsquo;s in there, honest! Them alders is
all loused up with tracks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;! Those grizzle bear is wild
animal&mdash;!&rdquo; The speaker was uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! They&rsquo;re &gt;awful wild. The minute he hears
you he&rsquo;ll come chargin&rsquo; out, hell bent. <sub>;</sub>You
ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&gt;scared, are you? You ain&rsquo;t scared of a
little ol&rsquo; &gt;bear? Well, I swan!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I go!&rdquo; said Marcel.</p>

<p>Of course Atlin knew everything was all right; just the same,
Marcel confessed to himself that this undertaking was not
altogether to his liking. When he drew near the thicket he loaded
the colonel&rsquo;s rifle. The shells were amazingly large; they
would undoubtedly make a deafening roar if they were fired, and the
weapon itself was as heavy as a cannon. He wondered if it would not
be a good idea to fire the gun now. But, no, Atlin had instructed
him to go quietly. No doubt the bear suspected that enemies were
about, and any loud noise would merely cause it to hide itself so
thoroughly that no amount of searching would discover it and thus
defeat the object of the entire expedition. One had to use the
guile of an aborigine in this hunting sport.</p>

<p>On hands and knees he crept into the covert.</p>

<p>The alders, flattened by the weight of heavy winter snows, made
going difficult, for they grew along the ground; their trunks were
twisted and their branches were interlaced. Marcel patiently
crawled through, between, over, and under them. In spite of himself
he felt his heart beating rapidly. Alas! there was no stuff in him;
his was the soul of a valet and it quaked at imaginary perils!</p>

<p>He paused after he had gone perhaps fifty yards, and listened. A
queer sound came to his ears&mdash;a subdued growling and snarling,
the rustle of a body moving among the leaves and twigs. So he had
alarmed the bear and it was in precipitate flight. But, no! The
disturbance continued in the same place. He saw a stir, an
oscillation of the branches ahead of him, then he realized that
there was neither fright nor menace in those mutterings. Rather
they suggested playfulness. His face lighted. &gt;Voila! Baby
bears! Baby bears at play! What luck! With redoubled caution he
pushed further ahead until the sounds were close at hand.</p>

<p>Marcel parted the leaves and craned his neck; what he saw
alarmed yet fascinated him. He was looking into a glade, an open
space a few yards in diameter, and in it three animals were
disporting themselves. But such animals! They were fat and
shapeless and clothed in rippling brown fur of amazing richness.
That which held the observer spellbound was their size. Manifestly,
they were not grizzle bears, for they were five times as large as
any dog. Neither were they side-hill gougers, for Marcel remembered
that gougers have long tails with red and yellow rings. These
creatures had no tails at all, or practically none.</p>

<p>Whatever they might be, they were in a pleasant mood and totally
unaware of his presence. They rolled over one another, they
wrestled gravely, they sat up in a ludicrous manner and pawed and
struck at one another for all the world as if they were boxing
after the absurd American fashion. Marcel decided they must indeed
be bears, but what to do next he did not know. After a while he
turned around and cautiously crept back out of the thicket. &gt;En
route he did some thinking; for the first time he began to doubt
the entire sincerity of Atlin&rsquo;s friendship.</p>

<p>The teamster was poised expectantly upon the hillside, his gun
in readiness; he was surprised when Marcel emerged from the alders
and stood up. The latter gesticulated excitedly, pointed back at
the thicket, and in vigorous pantomime tried to convey the
intelligence that he had encountered an extraordinary situation and
wished further advice.</p>

<p>Atlin approached down the slope, walking carefully and with
lowered eyes, as if looking for something.</p>

<p>Marcel danced; he grimaced elaborately in an effort to convey by
silent speech the fact that in yonder he had discovered not one but
three bears&mdash;or what he believed to be bears&mdash;but Atlin
was not skilled in lip reading. He proved, however, that he was
proficient in another accomplishment.</p>

<p>He found what he was looking for. He stooped, picked up a rock,
and threw it at the man below with surprising accuracy and amazing
violence. Marcel dodged. He could scarcely believe his senses.</p>

<p>The teamster armed himself with a second missile and stood
poised, frowning; with a gesture impossible to misinterpret he
motioned to his friend to crawl back into the brush or take the
consequences.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, Marcel became very angry. Was he indeed a servant,
subject even to the commands of Colonel Waldo&rsquo;s mule-skinner?
Or was he a man? He remembered what the colonel had said that
morning and he was seized with a grim, a malicious determination.
He would go back in yonder, but he would not frighten those bears
out for the amusement of Atlin and his friends; he would shoot one
himself. He would shoot two, all three of them, if they did not
secrete themselves without delay. He would show no mercy. He
reentered the copse and Atlin scrambled back to his post.</p>

<p>The little man followed the marks of his going and his coming
until again he heard the bears snarling and gamboling, but it was
difficult to obtain a position from which to fire with accuracy,
because the leaves were thick and the branches clutched at his gun
barrel like so many fingers.Through the canopy of twigs over his
head he could make out Atlin on the slope above, and his attention
was arrested by the latter&rsquo;s extraordinary actions. He was
lifting, straining at a huge slab of rock, and even as Marcel
watched him he managed to dislodge it. With a shove the teamster
sent it rolling down the hillside. It came in leaps and bounds,
gaining momentum rapidly; onward it rushed until with a crash it
flung itself into the thicket.</p>

<p>Then occurred an amazing phenomenon&mdash;something which froze
the valet&rsquo;s blood in his veins. Close at hand and where he
least expected it he heard a roar, a deep, rumbling rush of breath
and sound impossible to describe, and simultaneously the underbrush
oscillated to the movements of a gigantic body; it parted and there
before his bulging eyes an apparition upraised itself more dreadful
than anything he had ever dreamed about. It was a bear, but a bear
cast in an enormous mold. It was infinitely larger than those other
bears. It was mountainous. No doubt its astonishment at seeing
Marcel equaled his at seeing it, but the bear recovered more
quickly. The fur along its back rose; its muzzle wrinkled, curled
back into a terrifying snarl; its little, red, piggy eyes gleamed
wickedly. With surprising ease, considering its stupendous bulk, it
reared itself upon its hind legs and came striding, wallowing
through the brush toward the Frenchman. Alder trunks as thick as a
man&rsquo;s leg parted before it like so many grass stalks.</p>

<p>Marcel was aware of but one emotion&mdash;a soul-stirring
amazement at the size of the monster and its apparent lack of fear.
It was not in the least running away. Then he realized the
truth&mdash;it intended to dance with him!</p>

<p>These thoughts must have flashed through his mind like
lightning, for the bear was not forty feet away from him when he
first saw it. He must have acted with almost the same celerity. He
cocked his rifle and raised it. Colonel Waldo had warned him to
take his time! He aimed as deliberately as he was accustomed to aim
at the bright, bead-like eye of a ptarmigan, then he pulled the
trigger.</p>

<p>&gt;Sacre! What an explosion! The recoil of the rifle knocked
Marcel off balance and he found himself sitting in the mud. Quickly
he scrambled to his feet and ejected the spent shell.</p>

<p>The bear was no longer striding towards him, its towering head
level with the alder tops. It had lain down. It was quaking,
twitching with terror at the sound of that firearm. No
wonder&mdash;! Marcel started, for another bear, a second
bear&mdash;evidently one of the playful trio&mdash;crashed into
view, paused beside the one that had lain down, and smelled of it.
This was a smaller bear, but it was large enough. It espied Marcel
as he lifted his gun barrel and slowly took aim, and it emitted a
loud snort. Even as the man pulled the trigger he sensed rather
than actually saw its two playmates moving through the leafy
background.</p>

<p>The second shot set the marksman back in the mud again, but he
recovered himself as quickly as possible. Alas! These bears were
impossible to hit. The brush was bending and threshing as an
avalanche of brown rushed through it&mdash;two avalanches! He fired
at the nearest, without further effect than to evoke a hoarse
growl, then he turned and fired at a brown rump as it
disappeared.</p>

<p>By now it seemed to him that the thicket was alive with lunging
monsters, that he could hear them crashing, smashing through the
undergrowth on every side. Then he was startled nearly out of his
skin by a fusillade of shots from the mountain above, followed by
wild yells from Atlin.</p>

<p>Marcel would have turned and bolted, but it was impossible to
run through the thicket and, besides, he was too terrified to move.
He could plainly see the first bear he had shot at crouching in the
brush, ready and waiting for him to turn his back. Its eyes were
fixed upon his in an unblinking stare. The hair upon his head
stirred; he could feel it rise. He forgot the gun in his hand.
Coldly the monster glared at him through the alder trunks. Marcel
grew faint.</p>

<p>By and bye his gaze, hypnotically fixed upon the menace,
wavered, was drawn to something beyond. He changed his position,
stretched his neck. He could not believe his eyes. Yonder were two
bears! Lying side by side! They were dead! They must be dead!
Miracle of miracles! he had killed two grizzle bears; he, Marcel
Labaudie, the valet! He was sure they were dead, for when he spoke
to them they did not answer, nevertheless he was not sufficiently
sure they were dead to approach them. He was unfamiliar with the
habits of wild animals; perhaps they were merely &ldquo;playing
raccoon&rdquo; as the local saying went.</p>

<p>His attention after a while was attracted to another quarter,
and he investigated cautiously, timidly. What he discovered
convinced him that he was indeed quite out of his mind, for he
beheld still a third bear lying upon its side and breathing its
last. By this time nothing had the power to deepen his
astonishment.</p>

<p>He heard loud halloas finally, heard his name shouted, and he
answered. There was great relief in the tones of the Nome sportsmen
when he made them understand that all was well with him, but that
he needed assistance. After a while they and Atlin came to him,
crawling, fighting their way through the brush; breathlessly they
asked what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you see him, Marcel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hurt you, did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I seen him,&rdquo; Marcel told them, quietly.
&ldquo;I show him to you&mdash;all t&rsquo;ree of him.&rdquo; He
pointed, and his companions stared; they swore weakly, eloquently.
Cautiously they pushed forward and examined first one, then another
of the fallen giants. They were speechless, incoherent. Three huge,
Alaska browns; an old she bear that would stretch eleven feet as
she lay, and a pair of two-year-old cubs weighing six hundred
pounds apiece! shot by a French valet, in an alder thicket! There
was no language suitable for the occasion, nor for the emotions the
hunters experienced at thought of their own parts in the
exploit.</p>

<p>They told Marcel after a while that immediately following his
shots a bear had bolted out of the thicket and had nearly run over
Atlin. Atlin had fired five times at it, but it had escaped. They
had supposed, of course, that it was the animal which Marcel had
started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hit him, all right,&rdquo; Atlin asserted. &ldquo;He
was limpin&rsquo; some when I let up.&rdquo; These were practically
the first words the big teamster had uttered.</p>

<p>It was Hillker who said: &ldquo;Atlin, you&rsquo;re a dam&rsquo;
liar! I saw him when he broke cover and he was limping then. You
emptied your gun and never touched him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Marcel stared at Atlin Joe silently for a moment or two, and in
his eyes was much the same expression that still lurked in the
glazing eyes of that mother bear. To him had come a new
understanding of Alaskan bears and Alaskan men, at least men of
this type, and he tried to put it into words.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got somepin to tell you fellers. This long time Marcel
Labaudie is funny joke for you. He&rsquo;s valet. He&rsquo;s
servant man. You mak&rsquo; him wait on you, cook your grub, wash
your dish. You call him &lsquo;Frog.&rsquo; You brave
huntsmen&mdash;oh yes!&mdash;but you awful &rsquo;fraid of grizzle
bear, so you pick nice place for runnin&rsquo; away; then you send
for Marcel and say: &lsquo;Marcel, go chase him out! He&rsquo;s
little feller, no bigger as dog!&rsquo; You lie to Marcel. Then you
t&rsquo;row rock on him.&rdquo; The speaker had grown very white,
his eyes were blazing. &ldquo;Now Marcel goin&rsquo; tell you what
he t&rsquo;ink &rsquo;bout you. He t&rsquo;ink you t&rsquo;ree,
gret big lazy, lousy bums! He don&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; more for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With these words the speaker turned, made his way out of the
alders, and, without a look behind him, trudged back to his horse,
mounted it, and rode off.</p>

<p>There was genuine excitement at the Saw Tooth camp. The hunters
had returned, bringing with them three magnificent pelts and the
amazing story of Marcel Labaudie&rsquo;s feat, but Marcel himself
was not one of the party and nobody knew what had become of him. He
had turned his back upon his companions and ridden away; the
wilderness had swallowed him up.</p>

<p>Colonel Waldo had listened with an ominous lack of comment to
the story told him when Atlin and his two sportsmen came in, and he
had ordered camp broken the next morning. He could well understand
Marcel&rsquo;s anger&mdash;his was no less&mdash;and he had
supposed, of course, that he would find the latter at headquarters
when he arrived there. He was concerned to learn, upon reaching
home, that nothing had been seen of him. When the second night
passed without word of the missing man, he took steps to send out
searching parties.</p>

<p>Now nothing very serious had happened to Marcel. He had ridden
away from his companions, boiling with resentment&mdash;resentment
so all inclusive that it took in even Colonel Waldo&mdash;and he
had struck back in the direction of the main outfit, but it was
late when he started and he spent that night in the open, without a
fire. He was cold and miserable and in constant terror of being
devoured by gougers. It was a horrid experience. All the next day
he drifted about aimlessly, with nothing to eat except blueberries,
and not until the late Arctic twilight was darkening into night did
he see the first sign of a human habitation. Then he stumbled upon
a prospector&rsquo;s camp. He spent the night there. He ate much,
slept much, learned much. He and the prospector talked about bears,
and side-hill gougers, and ice worms, and submarine milkers, and
men like Atlin Joe Billings. His newfound friend had no sense of
humor; he saw nothing funny, for instance, about rolling a bowlder
into a bear&rsquo;s nest. He told the wanderer a good many things
of which the latter was ignorant, and when Marcel left he was
athirst for vengeance. His very soul was outraged and he was all
the angrier because of his present plight. It was a fine, Gallic
gesture to denounce those men who had imposed upon him and then to
stride away in dignity. But he had ruined it all by getting lost.
Marcel could have wept scalding tears at thought of this, for again
he had made himself a &ldquo;laughter stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was not the old Marcel Labaudie who rode into the Saw Tooth
camp that afternoon. His neat blue serge suit was torn and muddy,
his little derby hat was dented and out of shape, his linen was a
disgrace. He was grimy, sweat-stained, his face was overgrown with
a blue stubble of beard, and around his mouth was the deep
discoloration that only huckleberry juice can impart. But his black
eyes shone like jet buttons and his mustache was still twisted into
the likeness of two tiny rapier points.</p>

<p>There was a great to-do when he was recognized. Men came
running; they shouted greetings to him, shook his hands, clapped
him on the back. They all talked at once, so that he could
understand little of what they said, but instead of the ridicule he
had anticipated they actually appeared overjoyed to see him.
Nowhere among them did he descry Atlin, and he inquired as to the
teamster&rsquo;s whereabouts.</p>

<p>Atlin, he gathered, had that day been fired and he was at this
moment getting his things together. Marcel pushed through the crowd
and like a bee returning to its hive he made for the bunk tent. He
did not walk, he trotted. The men swarmed after him.</p>

<p>Flora Dahlgren had wept all that day, but she heard the
commotion and raised an eager, tear-stained face from her pillow.
Hastily she dried her eyes and, still sobbing, ran out of her
father&rsquo;s tent. She caught a glimpse of Marcel as he entered
the door of the big bunk tent, much as a wren darts into the
knot-hole guarding its nest, and she sped thither. An altercation
was under way when she arrived, and she paled, clutched at her
bosom, for she heard the shrill, vibrating tones of Marcel&rsquo;s
voice and the angry bass of Atlin Joe&rsquo;s. They were
quarreling. Atlin, the brute, would kill him! Flora moaned in
terror. Better that poor, heroic Marcel had fallen a prey to those
bears or had perished wretchedly of exposure than that he should
excite the teamster&rsquo;s devastating anger in this manner.</p>

<p>Marcel was hopping in rage; words tumbled from his
lips&mdash;words like &ldquo;false friend,&rdquo;
&ldquo;pig,&rdquo; &ldquo;assassin.&rdquo; French words, too, of
obscure meaning, but with a dreadful, wrath-provoking sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got eighty corn on your foots and you froze &rsquo;em
off, eh? Dog! Eskimo babies got whale for mother! Oh-h&mdash;you
devil-devil! Those grizzle bear is scare&rsquo; of his shadow.
He&rsquo;s dance for week wit&rsquo; frien&rsquo; of yours. Liar!
You push off the mountain those rock to destroy poor Marcel.
Traitor! Miserable Judas&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s a Jew?&rdquo; Atlin cried, resentfully.
&ldquo;Beat it, Frog! I lost myself a good job over you
an&rsquo;&mdash;Shut up! D&rsquo;you hear?&rdquo; He rose,
scowling, but the other continued to upbraid, to accuse:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You boil ice worm till he fall out. Ho-ho! You mak&rsquo;
lesson on the American box. You&rsquo;re fightin&rsquo; man. You
chase pipple in gopher house. Dirty swine! Vermin! Cheese
bug!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Atlin appealed to the other employees: &ldquo;Get him out if you
want to save him. Dam&rsquo; if I&rsquo;ll stand bullyraggin&rsquo;
from no&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a loud, stinging slap on the cheek from
Marcel&rsquo;s hand, and he uttered a bellow. He made ponderously
for the gadfly.</p>

<p>Flora Dahlgren screamed and tried to fight her way into the
tent, but she was held back. She did manage, however, to obtain a
position from which she could see what transpired next. Her
amazement was no greater than that of the other onlookers when she
beheld Atlin, livid with rage, swing at the dancing Frenchman, and
saw the latter dodge, then with an extraordinary display of agility
lift his foot and kick his assailant! In the chest! Marcel turned
his body, bent forward swiftly, and at the same instant lashed out
with his leg. It was a maneuver as unexpected by Atlin as by the
others. The teamster uttered a loud grunt and reeled backward.</p>

<p>He recovered himself, but not with sufficient quickness. Marcel
with the grace of a dancing master and the swiftness of an acrobat
followed, bent himself double for a second time and, to all
appearances, disjointed himself at the pelvis. Again he hurled his
foot at his antagonist with the force of a flail. This time he
kicked Atlin under the right arm and a hollow sound issued from the
latter&rsquo;s lungs. Next Marcel shifted to his other foot and
kicked Atlin in the left armpit.</p>

<p>The larger man was dazed, enraged at this indignity, but there
was no breath left in him with which to voice his opinion of this
outrageous and unfair method of assault and battery. He rocked upon
his feet; he lunged about; he swung heavily and tried to grapple
with his adversary, and meanwhile Marcel kicked him first on one
side, then on the other; on the ribs, on the head, in the stomach.
He dropped the big fellow, finally. Atlin fell with a crash and
crawled under his bunk. He was in great pain and bewilderment; the
universe was spinning dizzily about his head.</p>

<p>Marcel stooped and peered under the bunk at his victim. He was
breathing heavily from his exertions as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! Me, I chase pipple in gopher-house, too. I don&rsquo;
savvy the American box no more as you savvy &gt;la savate.
That&rsquo;s French way of boxin&rsquo;. How you like &rsquo;em? I
kick hole in board fence wit&rsquo; my sock feet, jus&rsquo; like
you. You&rsquo;re cave-man, eh? Me, too&mdash;only I don&rsquo;
know it biffore.&rdquo; He straightened himself, filled his chest,
and glared belligerently about at his spellbound audience.
&ldquo;Well, anybody goin&rsquo; mak&rsquo; fun on Marcel?&rdquo;
He scowled terribly and tugged at his mustache. &gt;&ldquo;Eh bien!
Get out the way. Mak&rsquo; passage for Marcel Labaudie.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Flora was no longer in the crowd. She had fled back to her tent
and was trembling there in mingled expectancy and dread. It was
perhaps twenty minutes before she heard quick, purposeful footsteps
approaching and recognized them as Marcel&rsquo;s. He did not knock
nor ask if he might enter; he flung the door wide and strode
through it.</p>

<p>Fiercely he stared at the cowering beauty; then he announced
harshly: &ldquo;I have lick this so big Atlin. I have kick him off
his dam&rsquo; block. Then I have gone to Colonel Waldo an&rsquo;
t&rsquo;row up my job. I am valet no longer. No. I am workin&rsquo;
in the store wit&rsquo; your papa. M&rsquo;sieu&rsquo; le colonel
has apologize&rsquo; for the insult I have endure at the fingers of
his frien&rsquo;s. My honor is satisfy. But you&mdash;!
&gt;You&mdash;!&rdquo; The burning intensity of the speaker&rsquo;s
gaze became almost intolerable. &ldquo;Well? You goin&rsquo; to
marry me nice, or mus&rsquo; I pull off your hair?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Marcel!&rdquo; quavered the girl. Tears came into her
blue eyes, she wrung her strong, capable hands. &ldquo;I never
liked Atlin. Honest, I never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! We see &rsquo;bout that. &lsquo;The puddin&rsquo;
is proof against eatin&rsquo;.&rsquo; Now mebbe you give me nice
kiss.&rdquo; With these words the speaker seized Miss Dahlgren
savagely.</p>

<p>&gt;&ldquo;Marcel!&rdquo; she cried again.
&ldquo;You&mdash;you&rsquo;re hurting me!&rdquo; There was a moment
of silence, then, &ldquo;You great, big,
splendid&gt;&mdash;brute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1><a name="CoolWaters" id="CoolWaters"></a>Cool Waters</h1>

<p>The valley was as dry as powder and as hot as the top of a
stove. It lay between barren hills, the naked summits of which were
blackened, doubtless by volcanic fires, although one could easily
imagine that the ceaseless rays of the vertical sun had burned them
brittle. The sandy plain separating the two ranges was covered with
desert vegetation&mdash;queer misshapen growths, most of which were
blunt and limbless. Some of the trees were mere stubs, others were
shaped like gallows, still others bore clumsy limbs of a sort and a
sparse covering of tiny leaves out of all proportion to the size of
the trunks against which they clung.</p>

<p>There were cacti of many varieties, of course, huge ribbed ones
forty feet tall that resembled tremendous candelabra, others that
were smaller and more grotesque in shape with hundreds of fleshy
upright ears or with melon-like knobs and protuberances upon their
extremities. An occasional shrub or clump of bushes upthrust itself
between the larger trees, but every growing thing was somehow
distorted; all were twisted by the heat, or bent by discouragement,
perhaps; likewise every growing thing, from the tiny cucumber
cactus, half buried in the sand, up to the tallest gallows tree,
was covered with spikes and spines, with dagger points and talons.
All these thorns were poisonous, all made festering wounds when
flesh came in contact with them. Virus tipped their points.</p>

<p>It was in truth a place of many poisons, a valley of pain, for
what discomfort the cat-claws and the dagger points failed to
inflict, the blistering sun and the irritating dust
accomplished.</p>

<p>At night when the weedless, grassless surface of the earth had
flung off most of the heat stored up during the day, it was
possible to breathe without gasping and to move about without
streaming sweat; but this relief was short and it merely served to
intensify the suffering that came with the ardent rays of the
morning sun. The days were hideously long.</p>

<p>It was not a fit dwelling place for man, and why nature had gone
to such lengths of devilish ingenuity in devising means to
discourage him was hard to understand. Gloria Fisk often asked
herself that question. Probably it was because of the oil, she
decided. Oil was precious; the getting of it always entailed
hardship and suffering. It seemed to her, however, that Nature had
outdone herself here; that she had been more cruel than necessary.
She could have economized on at least half of her discomforts and
still have left the place a Gehenna. The heat and the glare alone
were intolerable; why add the dust and the drought and the poisons
and the maddening isolation? Why pour out all her hatred upon this
place?</p>

<p>Other oil fields were not utterly impossible to live
in&mdash;the coastal fields, for instance, were bad enough, but
they were infinitely more livable than this. One could endure damp
heat or tropic fevers and stinging insects&mdash;even the
depredations of bandits&mdash;more easily than this eternal, dry,
blood-thinning heat. Bandits, however bloodthirsty, were better
than dust day and night, dust borne on every breeze, dust kicked up
by hoofs and wagon wheels and truck tires, dust that got into
one&rsquo;s food, one&rsquo;s clothing, one&rsquo;s eyes and ears
and lungs; ever-present dust from which there was no escape.
Insects, fevers&mdash;almost anything was better than the maddening
monotony of these rainless days during which nothing, absolutely
nothing, happened to divert one&rsquo;s thoughts from one&rsquo;s
misery.</p>

<p>There were still other oil countries, of course, where one could
live in actual comfort, where one could meet white people and speak
English and hear running water and see green grass&mdash;</p>

<p>Green grass! Cool waters!</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisk with a languid sigh went to the open window, parted
the dusty curtains, and peered out. The glare was blinding, heat
waves caused the distant derricks to dance and to waver. There was
a dryness in the air that caused her throat to contract so that it
seemed to rustle when she swallowed. It was a wretched
street&mdash;a roadway, almost incandescent at this hour of the
day&mdash;and it ran through a sprawling village of flimsy,
unpainted houses all hastily slapped together out of boards and
corrugated iron hauled in from the coast by rail. Sun like this
demanded thick &rsquo;dobe walls, of course, but there was neither
clay here at El Centro nor water with which to mix it. No, the
water, too, came by rail in hot steel tank cars, most of which were
foul.</p>

<p>Not a yard, not a fence, not a vine, not a bush, not a patch of
green met Mrs. Fisk&rsquo;s weary eyes&mdash;nothing but the
melancholy buildings, the road ankle-deep in a choking gray powder
that coated roofs and walls and even the scattering desert
vegetation round about the town itself.</p>

<p>Where the road came into view over a low knoll, there appeared a
rolling cloud created by the wheels of an approaching car. Roads
around El Centro were so rough that seldom could a car beat the
dust unless favored by a breeze; it must perforce rock and jolt
slowly through a suffocating smother that coated a driver&rsquo;s
lungs as thickly as his skin. Like a trail of smoke ignited by some
invisible brand, this dust streamer wound closer until Gloria made
out her husband at the wheel of his rattle-trap flivver.</p>

<p>All cars were rattle-traps six weeks after they were put over
these roads; this one complained loudly, its limber fenders
clashed, a jet of vapor rose from its radiator cap. Its tonneau was
piled full of rope and tackle. All automobiles at El Centro carried
similar cargoes. Veering drunkenly around the corner of the house,
it coughed once or twice as if clearing its one lung, then with a
long-drawn sigh of escaping steam it came to rest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hello, honey!&rdquo; Donald Fisk smeared the sweat and
the dust from his face and kissed his wife. He was a robust young
giant, but the desert had tried the fat out of his frame and left
it spare. His skin was burned almost black, and when he grinned his
teeth gleamed forth as white as dominoes. Like the other men of El
Centro, he smelled always of perspiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, but you&rsquo;re dirty!&rdquo; Gloria told him.
&ldquo;You look too funny&mdash;&rdquo; She laughed outright at the
expression lent by the muddy streaks of sweat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re feeling better, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
demanded, quickly. &ldquo;Jove, Gloria! That&rsquo;s the first time
you&rsquo;ve laughed in ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling wonderful! I&rsquo;m
&gt;well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems like a month at least since you laughed. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come! I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo; Playfully Gloria took
the thumb of his right hand in her fingers and led him across the
floor. She fairly danced ahead of him to the door of the bedroom,
where she bade him look. &ldquo;There! I&rsquo;ve been bubbling
ever since I heard about our reservation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Donald peered into the chamber; what he saw was an open steamer
trunk and a half-filled suitcase upon the bed. The room itself was
strewn with articles of clothing. &ldquo;Why, &gt;kid! You&rsquo;ve
begun to pack!&rdquo; Gloria nodded. &ldquo;Good Lord! And
it&rsquo;s ten days yet before we go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;but I couldn&rsquo;t wait. Oh, Don, you
don&rsquo;t &gt;know how I hate this place! You just haven&rsquo;t
the faintest conception how I absolutely &gt;hate it.&rdquo; Mrs.
Fisk was still laughing, but there was an hysterical catch in her
voice. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all that ails me&mdash;this desert! Now
I&rsquo;m going home. I&rsquo;m going home&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
home!&rdquo; She sang the words and her eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re not going to take all that trash when
you go. Not if I can help it,&rdquo; her husband declared; but she
interrupted his vigorous protest by saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe not, but it&rsquo;s such fun to get ready&mdash;and
I haven&rsquo;t anything else to pack. I can&rsquo;t sit still and
merely &gt;wait! I&rsquo;ve packed and unpacked a half dozen times.
When I get it all in, I pretend I&rsquo;ve forgotten something
important and there&rsquo;s barely time to throw it out and repack.
Oh, Don, little shivers and tickles run over me every time I think
of it! Home! I&rsquo;m going to pack every day. That telegram about
the stateroom has done more to cure me than&mdash;than anything. I
&gt;am well! Don&rsquo;t you think I am?&rdquo; Gloria&rsquo;s
voice quavered, broke; her face was briefly contorted and tears
appeared upon her lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, you&rsquo;re well. Just played out with the heat
and the confounded monotony, that&rsquo;s all. Wait till you begin
to breathe the good salt air.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And our stateroom is on the shady side of the
ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made sure of that. What&rsquo;s more, those fruiters
pump cool air into the cabins. Oh, it won&rsquo;t take you long to
pick up! I want you to have your old pep and your old color back
when we land. You&rsquo;ve got to have it or&mdash;well, the family
will make it deuced unpleasant for me.&rdquo; A furrow appeared
between Fisk&rsquo;s dusty brows. He stared about the sparsely
furnished rooms, then he said, earnestly: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been
a game kid to put up with this. It was worse than I expected; yes,
worse than your people said it would be. If I&rsquo;d realized just
what it was like here, I&rsquo;d never have brought you. But
say&rdquo;&mdash;his face lightened again&mdash;&ldquo;won&rsquo;t
it be great to put it over them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloria nodded. Her brief enthusiasm had left her limp, so she
sat down on the edge of the bed. She managed to summon enough
animation to agree. &ldquo;Yes. They were so smart&mdash;they knew
it all, didn&rsquo;t they? It will be nice to crow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mighty nice for me, anyhow. You just go ahead playing at
packing and unpacking your clothes, but when we leave we&rsquo;ll
throw &rsquo;em all away. I&rsquo;ll buy you new ones&mdash;the
most expensive ones on Fifth Avenue. I&rsquo;ll buy you more than
you ever had&mdash;twice as many as your dad gave you! Yes, and
we&rsquo;ll drive out the Island in our own limousine. I&rsquo;ll
get you a couple of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will be too late for the peonies when we get
there,&rdquo; Gloria said, musingly, &ldquo;but the roses will be
coming in. The ramblers on our place are wonderful. Think of it,
Don, roses, green grass, running water! That brook and the trout
pond! Won&rsquo;t it seem &gt;heavenly to be cool and clean again?
I&rsquo;m going to roll in the grass and bury my face in
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here! And the first time it rains I&rsquo;m going to
stand out and take every drop of it. It seems to me that every last
pore in my body is thirsty.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>

<p>&ldquo;How is the new driller getting along?&rdquo; Mrs. Fisk
inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;McKay? Oh, fine! All I&rsquo;m afraid of is that he may
work too fast. These hustlers are apt to be careless, you know.
He&rsquo;s at twenty-six hundred and fifty&mdash;right on top of
the structure. We&rsquo;ll be ready to shoot day after to-morrow.
I&rsquo;ve ordered the nitro and it will be out to-morrow. Believe
me, I&rsquo;m not going to lose a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If it comes in big&mdash;&rdquo; Gloria began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will. That well is going to live up to its name,
&lsquo;Homestake Number One.&rsquo; &rdquo; Fisk made the assertion
positively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be a five-thousand-barrel
well&mdash;or better. Can&rsquo;t help it, in that
location.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I had your confidence,&rdquo; his wife said,
doubtfully. &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m too tired to be enthusiastic
any more. I meant to ask if it will mean delay. Will you have to
stay and see to it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no! Everything&rsquo;s arranged. Once I bring it in,
Nolan can take charge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d &gt;die if we missed that boat. The well should
have been in a month ago, but&rdquo;&mdash;Gloria sighed&mdash;
&ldquo;something always seems to go wrong in this business. Just at
the last moment. Disappointment, heart-break&mdash;oh, I &gt;hate
it! &gt;Hate it! I&rsquo;m so nervous I could
scream&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s just a tired, sick little kid.&rdquo; Fisk
spoke comfortingly and stroked his wife&rsquo;s hair with a
mother&rsquo;s touch. &ldquo;This horrid old desert has worn her
out, but it&rsquo;s going to make her well and happy
and&mdash;rich. We&rsquo;ve made a hard fight, honey, but
it&rsquo;s nearly over. A little more courage, a little more
patience!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gloria regained control of herself with an effort and her
flower-like face broke into a smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be patient.
Only don&rsquo;t let anything happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he left the house, Donald told himself with a pang that he
had a sick girl on his hands. Gloria was sicker than she had
permitted him to realize and it had taken this brief flicker of
animation at the prospect of going home to show him just how weak
she really was. She was fragile, bloodless, the life and the
laughter had gone out of her. As a matter of fact, he had watched
it go day by day for months and he had tried vainly to check it,
but never before had he appreciated to what extent she had failed.
If anything should happen to her&mdash;Don closed his eyes and
refused to face such a thought. Only ten days more, then they would
go north to those green fields and cool waters of which she was
forever wistfully speaking. Ten days wasn&rsquo;t long.</p>

<p>This certainly was not a woman&rsquo;s country. Least of all was
it a country for a lovely, highbred creature like Gloria. But, Don
reflected, it had been this or nothing. Gloria had been willing,
nay eager, to marry him, even against her family&rsquo;s advice,
and even though it had meant exile. Nor had she once complained, at
least not until today when it was all over and she could voice her
hatred of this life without hurting him. That was like her, to fade
away, if need be to die by inches at his side, without
complaint.</p>

<p>One thing was sure&mdash;without Gloria&rsquo;s love to
strengthen him he would never have had the courage and the
pertinacity to win his fight against the desert. The mere fact that
his own money and that of his friends was sunk in the El Centro
field would not have been sufficient to keep him here. Not by any
means. He would have thrown up the undertaking long ago. But with a
wife like Gloria, a man couldn&rsquo;t quit; he couldn&rsquo;t
tolerate failure of any sort.</p>

<p>If he and Gloria had been able to get away once in a while it
would not have been so bad, but money from the wells which he had
somehow managed to drill had gone into new equipment, into storage
tanks, tank cars, drilling rigs, leases, and the like; for in order
to live at all in this business it had been necessary to expand,
and as a result production had not quite kept pace with
expenditures. It had been the old, heart-breaking story of most
so-called successful oil enterprises&mdash;just enough
encouragement to render it impossible to let go. But the company
had real holdings now, and with the Homestake making five thousand
barrels a day, yes, or even one-half that, it would be out of the
red in no time and its stock would be worth a lot. It would be
worth so much that Gloria could well afford to give her family the
laugh. Something like a million dollars, that&rsquo;s what it would
mean to them. And Homestake couldn&rsquo;t miss. El Centro
wasn&rsquo;t that kind of a pool. Once inside the limits, a man was
as safe as if his money were in the Bank of England.</p>

<p>Ten days more, then New York with its shops and its lights and
its theaters. He&rsquo;d show Gloria that he wasn&rsquo;t merely a
machine eternally thinking, talking, dreaming, living oil.
He&rsquo;d prove that he was the wildest, the most extravagant, the
most devoted lover the world had ever seen. The things he would buy
for her&mdash;the love, the tenderness he&rsquo;d shower upon her!
He&rsquo;d repay her for the faith and for the courage she had
shown. Ten days more!</p>

<p>Gloria ate but little supper that night. She attributed her lack
of appetite to excitement, to the anticipation of leaving, but as a
matter of truth, Francesca, the one servant they could afford, had
been more than usually shiftless that afternoon and the young wife
herself had been forced to prepare the meal. Any exertion of late
left her upon the ragged edge of utter collapse.</p>

<p>Donald&rsquo;s sympathetic remonstrance was interrupted by old
Pedro, the water man. Pedro halted his groaning truck outside the
house and called something in Spanish that took Fisk away from the
table and out into the road. Gloria had mastered only a few words
of the language&mdash;this climate robbed women of energy both
physical and mental&mdash;hence she could not understand what was
being said. When Don returned, he forestalled her anxious query by
announcing:</p>

<p>&ldquo;McKay&rsquo;s in some sort of trouble and I&rsquo;ve got
to run out there again. Don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of trouble?&rdquo; Gloria&rsquo;s tired face
was suddenly drawn with apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some kind of a fishing job&mdash;Pedro didn&rsquo;t know
just what.&rdquo; Fisk came around the table and kissed his wife.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fret, and don&rsquo;t wait up for me. You know
how long everything takes around a well. I may not get it fixed
before morning.&rdquo; He smiled reassuringly and playfully pinched
her ear. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t afford to risk any delay for the sake
of a little sleep, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>With sinking heart Gloria watched him go, for there had been
something in his voice that belied his cheerful words. This hateful
oil business! Its hazards were never ending; there was a malignant
genius in the wells that took delight in wrecking human plans and
killing high hopes, however well founded.</p>

<p>Don returned for breakfast, hot and tired and dirty; he began
gruffly: &ldquo;I was afraid of McKay! He dropped a tool in the
hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does that mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t set up his joint properly, I presume.
Anyhow, it means we&rsquo;ve got to fish it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a&mdash;a long job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not necessarily; depends on how the stem is cocked, and
things like that. We&rsquo;re going to take a picture of
it&mdash;you know, lower a soap mold and take an impression. While
they&rsquo;re doing that I&rsquo;m going to get a few hours&rsquo;
sleep&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t been off my feet all night. Lord,
it&rsquo;s hot!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fisk lay on his bed all that morning, and he perspired in his
sleep. Meanwhile his wife went on with her packing and her
unpacking. There was indeed very little to get ready and it was a
foolish waste of effort, but she had to do something with her hands
and this occupation gave her the same pleasure she had derived from
folding and unfolding her doll&rsquo;s clothes for imaginary
journeys. She had loved to play that game when she was a tiny girl
and she was becoming very childish of late.</p>

<p>Don left again during the most cruel heat of the afternoon; he
returned about midnight and Gloria gathered from what he told her
that these fishing jobs were tedious at best and that the crew was
getting along as well as could be expected.</p>

<p>For two days his nightly report was the same. Had the accident
occurred earlier, he would have proceeded, upon failure to grapple
the troublesome bit stem, to sidetrack the obstruction, so he
explained. In other words he would have drilled past it by allowing
the second bit to be deflected by the first. The lost tool was in
reality a forty-foot steel shaft standing in the bottom of the
hole, and it weighed many hundreds of pounds. Inasmuch as it was
tipped so that its upper end rested against the side of the well,
it was not easy to get hold of. This new drilling would have
resulted in a crooked hole fifty or sixty feet deep and would have
left the obstructing tool standing upon a shelf of rock. By
exploding a small shot a few feet below this shelf the lost bit
could have been dropped into the
pocket&mdash;sidetracked&mdash;after which the old shaft could have
been carried on.</p>

<p>But Fisk declared he was afraid to attempt this maneuver so
close to the structure. Other oil men had warned him against doing
so. Twice something of the sort had been tried in the El Centro
field and in each instance a ruined well had resulted. The shots
had seared the rock&mdash;due perhaps to some peculiar
characteristic of the formation. Again he told his wife not to
worry; some new fishing tools were on the way up from the coast;
McKay might have the obstruction out before they arrived&mdash;in
fact, he might get hold of that bit stem at any moment. That was
the way with fishing jobs.</p>

<p>Don maintained this hopeful attitude; in his wife&rsquo;s
presence he continued to be cheery, but out at the Homestake, where
he spent twenty out of every twenty-four hours, he was anything but
optimistic. Nor was he a pleasant person to get along with. Under
ordinary circumstances he would have refused to be unduly perturbed
by the accident, for delays are an inevitable part of the oil game
and grappling blindly for a bit stem in the bottom of a steel-lined
shaft a quarter of a mile deep is slow work at best. Sometimes it
takes weeks.</p>

<p>But circumstances were not ordinary. Gloria&rsquo;s heart was
set on catching that boat, the days were slipping past, and Don
could no longer blind himself to the truth that she was seriously
ill and ought to go. And yet there was nobody here he could send
with her, nor could he leave until the well was in. The directors
wouldn&rsquo;t stand for that, even if he could bring himself to do
such a thing. It so happened&mdash;as it usually does
happen&mdash;that no time in the entire history of the
company&rsquo;s operations could have been more unpropitious than
the present for a mishap such as this. The treasury was low, there
were bank loans soon to be met; nothing less than big new
&ldquo;production&rdquo; could avert a serious crisis. If he lost
the Homestake, the company was wrecked.</p>

<p>Fisk drove his men without mercy, but it was maddeningly futile
work, this blind grappling, this interminable experimenting with
one device after another. He became irritable and jumpy; his hands
shook when he wiped the stinging sweat out of his eyes; he cursed
the desert aloud when its heat rendered the work doubly hard.
Working on that derrick floor was like working upon a bed of coals.
Every piece of metal that flesh fell upon was hot enough to
blister; the stale water that he and his men swilled down their
throats was tepid, and even in their sleep they were thirsty.</p>

<p>Fisk told his wife grimly one day that they could not make the
boat. She took the announcement much as she would have taken a blow
in the face. It left her pallid and stricken with something
infinitely worse than pain. She crept away, and a few minutes later
he found her weeping. She made no sound, there was no expression of
grief upon her face, but tears of utter exhaustion were coursing
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Honey! Honey girl!&rdquo; her husband cried in agony.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take it like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to smile. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired, Don! I&rsquo;ve
been planning so. Oh, Don, I haven&rsquo;t strength left to stand
another disappointment!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch the next boat, sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking so much about the green grass
and the cool waters! I&rsquo;m so hot&mdash;so tired!&rdquo; Fisk
nodded; his face was working. &ldquo;I know. But I can&rsquo;t
leave. I can&rsquo;t&mdash;without throwing away everything
we&rsquo;ve fought for. The company will go to smash&mdash;you
understand! I&rsquo;d chuck it all if it were mine, but the crowd
relies on me. They&rsquo;d never forgive me. I&rsquo;d be a
quitter!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so.&rdquo; Gloria tried unsuccessfully to check
the tears. &ldquo;My people, too! We wouldn&rsquo;t have our
triumph, would we? You mustn&rsquo;t mind me. I&rsquo;m such a
baby! I&rsquo;ll be all right as soon as I get home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Day after day the work at the well went on; day after day there
was some new device, some fresh invention to try. More than once
Fisk was tempted to risk everything by exploding a charge of
nitroglycerine that would shatter the obstruction and then attempt
to drill through the mass of broken metal. But other oil men warned
him that he was crazy to think of such a thing. He might better
pull his casing and start a new hole.</p>

<p>He began to wonder if he were not indeed going crazy, for at
times he was tempted, oh, so sorely tempted, to snatch up his pale
little girl wife and fly with her, leaving the company to salvage
what it could from the wreckage. Only by the strongest effort of
will did he resist this insane temptation.</p>

<p>When he canceled their second reservation Gloria went to bed.
There seemed to be nothing seriously wrong with her and in fact
there was nothing the matter&mdash;except a broken heart.
Racehorses are like that&mdash;they will run until their hearts
break, until there is not another gallop in them; and Gloria was
from thoroughbred stock. The desert had beaten her.</p>

<p>A few days later Fisk wired to the port for the best doctor
available, and the latter came up on a special locomotive. What the
doctor said drove out of the husband&rsquo;s mind all thoughts of
oil, of fishing jobs, of Homestake Number One. A nurse was secured
as quickly as possible and meantime the physician stayed on.</p>

<p>Fisk did not return to the well; he hung about the house, a dumb
figure of suspense. Gloria no longer knew him and that was
terrifying. He was like a frightened child, deserted and alone.
Every whisper that issued from her lips was like a knife-thrust. He
did not sleep; his eyes grew bloodshot from the tears that came
whenever he left the sick room.</p>

<p>The doctor and the nurse watched him covertly and more than once
they found him muttering words as senseless as those that fell from
the sick wife&rsquo;s lips. He wildly cursed himself and the
desert.</p>

<p>Over and over, in his saner moments, Fisk told himself that this
was all a hideous nightmare from which he would awaken. It must be
a dream. His mind could not envisage a tragic culmination to his
long and bitter struggle&mdash;his and Gloria&rsquo;s struggle.
There is, there must be, a law of compensation; things come out
right in the end and the innocent do not suffer. God wouldn&rsquo;t
punish Gloria for his sin. That was inconceivable.</p>

<p>Nature finally exacted toll for the way he had cheated her, and
although he ached intolerably for sleep, he arrived at a condition
where he could not close his eyes; when he lay down his brain began
to race and black fancies drove him sighing out of his bed.</p>

<p>One morning when the brazen sun rose over the hills and began
again to pour its hatred into the valley, the doctor told him as
gently as possible that the end was near and that he must prepare
himself. It was merely a question of time now, a question of hours,
when the tired heart would cease to function. Gloria was in no
pain; further stimulants were useless, they would merely serve to
hasten that inevitable moment when the weight of her lungs would
prove too heavy for her feeble breath to lift.</p>

<p>Donald groaned. If only she would revive enough to recognize
him, to give him one word, one look! He would know then that she
forgave him. But for her to slip away without even a smile, a
kiss&mdash;God, no! It was not she who was ill, dying; it was
he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a case where any sort of medicine can do
much good,&rdquo; the doctor explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had other
cases like it. Nothing organically wrong, but&mdash;you understand!
It&rsquo;s the country, I guess. The heat or the monotony
or&mdash;hope deferred, maybe. We have a lot of it down here. If
your well had come in, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;d have
rallied.&rdquo; He said something more, about his other patients;
about the next morning&rsquo;s train; about a chance to ride down
on one of the tank cars&mdash;but Fisk did not hear him.</p>

<p>The husband sat most of that day in a trance waiting for his
hideous dream to end. Sometimes he bowed his head in his hands, but
the other watchers could not tell whether it was tears or sweat
that ran down between his fingers. They fancied it must be the
latter, however, for his grief was too abysmal for tears and in his
eyes there appeared to be no comprehension of what was going
on.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Fisk heard the little brown Goya children
playing in the road. They were laughing! He groaned aloud.
Children! Gloria and he had wanted children, but there again the
desert had thwarted them. This was no country for white women. A
man might as well lock his wife in a furnace and expect her to bear
children.</p>

<p>So Gloria was dying! And he had killed her! He rose and creaked
about the house, wringing his hands. His mental numbness was
wearing off now and agony consumed him. His mind was galloping,
running away, and he talked incessantly, but with a thick tongue
and without finishing his sentences. Yes. He had killed her! He had
staked her out on the blistering desert as the Apaches staked out
their prisoners, leaving the sun to wreak its torture.</p>

<p>What was that the doctor had said? If Homestake had come in she
would have lived? Oh, there were devils in this valley! They were
in the air, in the dagger points that armed the cacti and the
blood-bushes. Yes, and other demons were in the rocks beneath the
hills. These latter were the worst, for they collected in the
bottom of oil wells and cut cables; they deflected fishing tools;
they filled threads and sockets with mud and grit. Malignant
devils! The Homestake was full of them.</p>

<p>An insane determination took slow hold of Fisk. He went out and
cranked up his flivver, mumbling to the nurse that it was necessary
for him to go out and look after the job. Company affairs, he told
her, wildly, had to proceed, even if girl wives died and their
husbands went crazy with grief. Companies were like
that&mdash;soulless and unfeeling&mdash;just like
devils&mdash;great joke on company managers, wasn&rsquo;t it? They
put in their lives, they sweated their souls white, and
got&mdash;this. Damn all companies!</p>

<p>The car shot away and went rocking, pitching down the road.</p>

<p>McKay and his men were asleep when their employer arrived; he
did not awaken them. The desert moon was bright enough to read by,
so he flung himself out of the car and picked his way to the shanty
where the nitroglycerine was stored. The explosive was just as he
had left it three weeks before; he carried it out into the light
and poured it into the long tin containers designed for lowering
into the well. He worked swiftly and with no more caution than if
he were handling so much lubricating oil. The torpedoes, when
filled, he carried in upon the derrick floor; then he ran a thin
manila line through a block, and the end of this he made fast to
the first cartridge.</p>

<p>So! Those little devils would drop his tools, would they?
They&rsquo;d wreck the well, bankrupt the company, and make him
lose his boat, eh? Murderers, that&rsquo;s what they were. They had
murdered Gloria. By Heaven! two could play at that game!</p>

<p>He let the long, shiny torpedo slip quietly into the casing
mouth so as not to give them warning of what he had in mind.</p>

<p>McKay and his crew were awakened by a peculiar sensation; it was
as if their beds had been lifted a few inches by the upward thrust
of a thickly padded piston and then dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Who kicked my bunk?&rdquo; inquired the driller as
he sat up.</p>

<p>A startled voice answered him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny! Me
too. Did you fellows hear anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One man had, another had not. Somebody suggested an
earthquake&mdash;anything was likely to happen in this accursed
country. They were arguing stupidly in the dark when McKay spoke
with all trace of sleepiness gone from his voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! . . . My God, listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An instant, then he was out upon the floor and the others had
followed him. They stood strained, alert. At first the hush of the
desert was as complete as that of a tomb; then from somewhere came
a long, sighing exhalation, not unlike breath issuing from the
lungs of a wounded giant. It was an eery, penetrating sound, close
yet far away; it came from nowhere, from everywhere, and it raised
the hair upon the necks of the listeners. Together they tumbled out
of the shanty.</p>

<p>There was nothing in sight except the Homestake derrick, a gaunt
skeleton silvered by the moon; nevertheless that sigh grew, second
by second, and as it continued it changed into a whistling moan,
indescribably blood-curdling. The men realized finally that it came
from the well. And yet that was impossible! The soil beneath their
feet was trembling now; from the casing mouth issued a vibrating
rumble, a rasping, gasping, gurgling roar.</p>

<p>Then before their staring eyes an amazing thing took place.
Homestake Number one vomited into the night a geyser of black mud
and water and broken stone. The burden came with a great retching,
as if coughed out from the very vitals of the earth, but oddly
enough, instead of diminishing, the jet mounted higher, moment by
moment, along with the pitch of the sound that came with it. It
sprayed up, up, climbing the eighty-foot derrick section by
section, until the crown block was hidden. It stood there finally,
a tremendous fountain belching its rage up towards the empty sky.
There was the rush of many waters; the desert was drowned beneath a
deluge; there came a raw, penetrating odor of gas and petroleum.
Homestake Number One had come in.</p>

<p>The valley had flung off its suffocating shroud of heat; for a
few hours at least there was respite. In the living room of the
Fisk home the doctor and the nurse were talking quietly, soberly;
occasionally they stopped and listened, for out of the night came a
monotonous note like the hoarse blast of a siren many miles away.
Finally through this irritating monotone came another sound, the
approaching rattle of a rickety automobile. The road was
illuminated by the glare of headlights, then in the open doorway
there appeared the figure of a man in dripping, oil-soaked garments
which the dust of the road had rendered indescribably foul. His
hair was matted, his face was smeared, his shoes were sodden, and
when he stepped they oozed a sticky liquid the color of tar. He
had, it seemed, been plunged into a lake of oil, then rolled in
dirt, for he reeked with the smell of crude petroleum.</p>

<p>It was Donald Fisk. He stood rocking upon the threshold; the
whites of his eyes glared wildly as he fixed his gaze upon the
bedroom door; he tried to voice a question, but the dust was thick
in his throat and he failed.</p>

<p>The doctor approached him, laid a hand upon his greasy sleeve,
and spoke in a low tone: &ldquo;She is&mdash;asleep!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fisk flung off the grasp, lifted his arms on high and uttered a
cry of despair. &ldquo;Gloria! Gloria&mdash;&rdquo; He clenched his
grimy fists and shook them, he began to curse in a hoarse,
horrible, croaking voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; The doctor seized him again, struggled with
him. &ldquo;Man! You don&rsquo;t understand. She&rsquo;s asleep!
She&rsquo;s better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fisk comprehended nothing at first except the sharp admonition
for silence; that was all his brain could compass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The change came an hour ago. She has a chance. Heaven
only knows what happened&mdash;&rdquo; There was a breathless pause
while Donald Fisk slowly groped his way up out of utter blackness.
In the silence could be heard that same faint monotone. It sounded
like the distress signal of some distant liner, the whistle rope of
which had been tied down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a miracle, Mr. Fisk!&rdquo; the nurse piously
asserted. &ldquo;Strength came to her out of nowhere. She began to
breathe more easily, her heart grew stronger&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the well! She was waiting&mdash;waiting. It came
in an hour ago! Don&rsquo;t you hear it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quiet! Not so loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the husband was deaf to caution. &ldquo;Her soul was
waiting, hovering&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t leave me as long as
there was hope&mdash;&rdquo; A convulsion racked the oil-soaked
figure. &ldquo;Homestake came in like a lion, like a thousand
lions, roaring, belching&mdash;&rdquo; His voice broke, he choked.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the biggest well in the country! Twenty thousand
barrels a day or more. My head&rsquo;s splitting from the noise. It
drowned me&mdash;deafened me! When I saw it was oil I&mdash;I
cursed God!&rdquo; The speaker turned, lurched blindly to the wall,
and, resting his head in his hands, began to sob like a little boy.
&ldquo;I stood there with my face to the sky and cursed
God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Towards morning Gloria stirred, opened her eyes, listened, then
smiled contentedly at her husband. He had to bow his head close to
catch her whispered words: &ldquo;Our boat! I was so tired! I
thought I couldn&rsquo;t wait any longer. Then&mdash;I heard it
coming in&mdash;our ship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo; He pressed his hungry lips to her
cheek. &ldquo;You waited, and our ship came in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="TheMichiganKid" id=
"TheMichiganKid"></a>The Michigan Kid</strong>
</h1>

<p>Conditions were just right for snowballing.</p>

<p>The weather had turned warm during the night and morning found
the snow wet enough to pack well. By the time Jimmy Rowan arrived
at the school grounds he was glowing, panting. He had
&ldquo;washed&rdquo; the faces of several girls, to an
accompaniment of shrill protests and panicky shrieks, and some of
the older boys had run him down, cornered him, and washed his face
until his cheeks shone like a ripe tomato. His mittens were wet;
there was snow down his neck and inside his stockings; his muscles
ached, for he had launched a hundred missiles and dodged a
thousand. Gee! it was fine!</p>

<p>A real battle was in progress in front of the school yard. On
opposite sides of the street rival forces were drawn up; sallies
and counter-sallies, charges and flank attacks, were going on amid
a pandemonium of shouts and warwhoops. Into the fray Jimmy dashed.
Delirium seized him.</p>

<p>The Rowan kid was a stocky youngster and he could throw a
snowball with what seemed to him a destructive, nay a deadly force,
but, alas! he was wild! Every time he threw he grunted, and
frequently he fell down&mdash;heavy guns have a terrible
recoil&mdash;but thus far he had scored no hits.</p>

<p>Just as things were at their hottest there sounded the musical
jingle of sleigh bells and into School Street turned a team of
high-stepping bays hitched to a cutter. It was the Morris rig, and
Mr. Hiram Morris himself was driving. He wore his high, shiny silk
hat and his beaver gauntlet driving gloves and the overcoat with
the beaver collar. The Morris buffalo robe hung down over the
swelling sides of the cutter. The clamor abated; hostilities were
suspended to let him pass between the battle lines, for Mr. Hiram
Morris was Dover&rsquo;s leading citizen and when he appeared
everything in town ceased, fell out of step. Dover stood in awe of
Hiram Morris and it was proud of his turnout, which represented the
last word in style and luxury.</p>

<p>On came the equipage; snow flew from the horses&rsquo; hoofs,
their tails and their manes were streaming; Mr. Morris&rsquo;s
hands were wrapped in the taut lines and his thin, angular face was
set straight ahead.</p>

<p>Now the Rowan kid took his fighting seriously. Fighting, even in
make-believe, was something that could be taken on at a
moment&rsquo;s notice, but, once begun, it was a sort of sacred
ritual that had to be carried out to the very end. He was like a
snake&rsquo;s tail in that he never quit until sundown, and what is
more, certain of his normal faculties went into eclipse when he
engaged in combat&mdash;caution fled; he became possessed of a
superlative audacity. The frenzy of battle was on him now. He had
&ldquo;pegged&rdquo; snowballs at perfect strangers on the way to
school and perfect strangers had pegged them back at him. With the
exception of that band of heroes at his back the whole world was in
arms against him.</p>

<p>His eyes fixed themselves hypnotically upon the majestic
spectacle sweeping towards him; mechanically he groped for a
handful of snow. His fingers clutched something round and hard; joy
of joys, it was spent ammunition of some earlier fray! A snowball
turned to ice! Jimmy let fly with all his might from the very outer
edge of the sidewalk. He had no faintest expectation of hitting Mr.
Hiram Morris; it was merely the high ambition to accomplish bigger
and better things. But it was his luck that out of all the missiles
he had hurled that morning this particular one should speed to its
mark with the unerring accuracy of a rifle bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris&rsquo;s head was actually knocked out from under his
&ldquo;stovepipe&rdquo; hat. He uttered a cry of mingled pain,
profanity, and astonishment, then loudly he shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whoa!&rdquo;He jerked his horses back upon their
haunches; his face was convulsed; blood was streaming from his
cheek, for that frozen snowball had a stone in it. Swiftly the
great man stepped out of the cutter and strode towards his
petrified and horror-stricken assailant. There was a scurrying of
boys at Jimmy&rsquo;s back. The heroes fled, leaving him alone.
Awfully alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Young man!&rdquo; It was the first time in his eleven
long years of life that the Rowan kid had ever been addressed by
such a dreadful title. &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;James Rowan.&rdquo; This information was voiced in a thin
and feeble soprano. Jim had never realized what an enormous man Mr.
Hiram Morris was. He was taller than a church steeple and that
blood on his face rendered him incredibly horrid to look at.</p>

<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;James Rowan&rsquo;, eh? Jim Rowan&rsquo;s boy, I
presume. Well, young man, come with me.&rdquo; Mr. Morris inserted
long, thin, icy fingers into Jimmy&rsquo;s collar and strode
towards the school building. Jimmy went with him, touching his toes
to the sidewalk every few yards.</p>

<p>The school principal fell into a downright panic when
Dover&rsquo;s leading citizen entered his office with his face
streaming blood, with one eye already swelled half shut, and with
the Rowan urchin dangling from his hand. Hiram Morris, of all men!
Here was catastrophe.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris deposited his wretched burden, then in answer to the
principal&rsquo;s bleat of dismay, he snapped:</p>

<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;What&rsquo;s happened&rsquo;? Don&rsquo;t you see
what has happened! This young demon tried to&mdash;to kill me. What
have you got to say for yourself?&rdquo; Mr. Morris shook Jimmy to
drive this question home.</p>

<p>The young demon had very little to say and very little voice
with which to say it. He was sorry; he hadn&rsquo;t meant it; he
could not explain the satanic impulse which had prompted the
outrage; but&mdash;all the boys were snowballing. He never thought
he could hit Mr. Morris; he never hit anybody he threw at. It was
just fun. Jim had become very white and ill; his eyes were swimming
in tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Morris. Oh, my dear Mr. Morris!&rdquo; The
principal wrung his hands, cracked his knuckles. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
punish him and I&rsquo;ll send him home&mdash;expel him, of course.
Why, I tell people that we have only little ladies and gentlemen
here. It&rsquo;s a reflection upon the institution and upon me. The
board will be furious.&rdquo; The speaker chattered along in this
vein until Morris interrupted him to say in an altered voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t expel the boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, but for the sake of discipline, Mr.
Morris!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says he didn&rsquo;t mean to do it. I was furious for
a moment, but I&rsquo;ve been in snowball fights myself.
There&rsquo;s a kind of insanity that tackles kids. I&rsquo;m not
seriously hurt&rdquo;&mdash;the great man was trying to stanch the
flow of blood from his cheek with an expensive
handkerchief&mdash;&ldquo;and he realizes it wasn&rsquo;t a nice
thing to do. Is that right, Jimmy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We all make mistakes. Jimmy, I want you to promise to
always play fair, after this. Give the other fellow a chance and
never hit him when he isn&rsquo;t looking. Will you
promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s frightened nearly to death. I think he has
been punished enough.&rdquo; With his bloodstained handkerchief
still pressed to his wound Mr. Morris left the principal&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<p>This charity of view the principal did not by any means share
and the Rowan kid got a licking that he always remembered. This may
be a good place, by the way, to state that neither did he forget
his promise to Hiram Morris. In the months and years immediately
following, the memory of his atrocious act remained fresh; it
became a sore spot in his mind which would not heal, and whenever
he recalled it he experienced the keenest shame. This had an
effect, for it prevented him from getting well acquainted with Rose
Morris, his victim&rsquo;s daughter&mdash;something he desperately
longed to do.</p>

<p>Rose was at once the richest and the prettiest girl in Dover.
She drove a sleek, fat little pony hitched to a marvelous wicker
dogcart, the envy of every child in town, and to the Rowan kid she
represented all that was both desirable and unattainable. By the
time he was fifteen he was hopelessly in love with her and he
carved hearts and arrows on all the trees in his yard and initialed
them with interlocking R&rsquo;s and J&rsquo;s. He wrote her
passionate misspelled love notes and in words of fire he told her
of his undying devotion. He never sent the notes, of course, and
his declarations were only whispered to the empty air, for he still
remained &ldquo;the Rowan kid&rdquo;; his people were desperately
poor and he was cursed with a sensitive pride. He was not only
ashamed of his poverty, but also he felt certain that she looked
upon him as the would-be assassin of her father, hence in her
presence he was stricken dumb.</p>

<p>Jim was surprised one day to hear that Mr. Hiram Morris had
&ldquo;gone out of business&rdquo; and was leaving for the West.
What that meant the boy did not know, but he understood that the
Morris fortune was not what it had been. Rose and her mother
remained in Dover. They lived on much as usual and they referred
vaguely to those large interests which kept Mr. Morris away from
home, but the pony and dogcart were gone and so were the
high-stepping bays. It was while Jim was working his way through
college that they quietly moved away. The Morris house sold for
barely enough to pay the mortgage.</p>

<p>Some people endure poverty cheerfully, others with a grim
stoicism: the majority of people who are born poor accept it with a
fatalistic resignation and never look forward to anything else. Jim
Rowan was unlike any of these. He loathed poverty; it was
unendurable. It had kept him from knowing Rose Morris, and, now
that she was a poor girl, it prevented him from coming to her
rescue. He swore he would make himself rich for her sake. In time
this became a fixed idea with him and he quit college and went to
work, savagely. It took him quite a while, however, to realize that
riches are not come by in a hurry and that he was getting nowhere.
He had lost track of the Morrises completely&mdash;there was no use
of keeping in touch with them&mdash;but he still had his
day-dreams, he still thought of himself as Rose&rsquo;s prince who
sooner or later would search her out and seat her upon a throne.
Depression seized him occasionally when he saw how hopeless was the
task he had set for himself. At such times he grew desperate and he
told himself that no price was too great to pay for success; he
longed for some opportunity of becoming suddenly rich and vowed
that he would sell his soul for such a chance.</p>

<p>The chance came finally, or it seemed to come, with the news of
the Klondike discovery. Jim joined the first rush to the Yukon and
he arrived in Dawson City with the firm determination to make a
fortune somehow, anyhow. Here again, however, he learned that money
was not to be had for the asking.</p>

<p>Placer mining was a hazardous undertaking, with the odds a
thousand to one against success. Education counted for little in a
country where men were judged on a pick-and-shovel basis and paid
for the actual work they did. Jim saw that here was not the place
in which to earn a fortune; here was nothing but speculation,
chance, a gamble either with men or with nature. In order to beat
the game one had to risk all, then double his winnings and risk
them again and again. To gamble here was not a sin, it was the
daily practice of everybody. Men gambled with death when they hit
the trail; they gambled again when they staked their labor and
their time against Nature&rsquo;s bedrock secrets, only they took
longer chances than when they heaped their chips on the roulette
table or dropped their &ldquo;pokes&rdquo; on the high card. There
was this difference, too; Nature seldom played fairly, whereas
there were many square gambling houses in Dawson.</p>

<p>Jim Rowan fitted himself to his new surroundings and adapted
himself to a new code of morals. He played as other men played,
except in one respect; he never played for the excitement or for
the fun of it, he played only to win. He played for Rose Morris. He
tried speculating in claims, but he was unlucky: his only winnings
came from the manipulating of Dawson City real estate or at cards,
and the time arrived when he found himself the owner of a huge
Front Street saloon and gambling house, together with a nickname of
the Alaskan flavor. Perhaps a score of people knew him as James
Rowan, but to the thousands that went in and out of his place he
was &ldquo;The Michigan Kid.&rdquo; That was the way he even signed
his checks, for the name had brought him luck, and superstitiously
he clung to it.</p>

<p>Life flowed at a furious pace in those early days. Reputations
were made in a night; in six months they were hallowed; in a year
they had become legendary. There were many celebrities in the Yukon
country the mere mention of whom evoked tales of sensational
exploits on the trail, at the mines, or at the gambling tables; the
one perhaps best known of all was &ldquo;The Michigan Kid.&rdquo;
He it was who best typified the composure, the steady nerve, the
recklessness of his profession. A hundred stories were told about
him, and some were not pleasant, for it required a ruthless man to
hold down the job that Jim had taken, but most of them had to do
with his luck. That luck became a byword, finally: men blessed with
some extraordinary and unexpected good fortune were apt to boast
that they had &ldquo; &lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck.&rdquo;
&ldquo; &lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck&rdquo; became an
Alaskan phrase.</p>

<p>More than once Rowan took stock of his winnings and realized
that he had nearly attained the goal he had set for himself, but
invariably Fate intervened to prevent him from quite reaching the
quitting point. Time crept along. The cycle of life for placer
camps is brief. Dawson grew, flourished, began to die;
representatives of big companies appeared and bought up tracts of
property; they talked of huge dredging and hydraulic projects.</p>

<p>Some of these newcomers were possessed of the gambling fever and
they tried their luck against The Michigan Kid&rsquo;s. Rumors
spread of big games in the back rooms of the Kid&rsquo;s place,
games where the sky was the limit. One man in particular scoffed at
&ldquo; &lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck&rdquo; and prophesied
that he would &ldquo;get&rdquo; the Kid&mdash;send him out of the
country broke. This was a Colonel Johnson, a great engineer and
mining promoter who represented a London syndicate. He and Rowan
met, finally, much as famous duellists meet, and behind locked
doors they played for twenty hours. What the stakes were nobody
knew, but they must have been enormous, and luck must have run the
Kid&rsquo;s way, as usual, for Colonel Johnson rose finally,
stepped out into the hall, and killed himself.</p>

<p>That at least was the story which was made public and which the
authorities accepted. Certain spiteful-minded persons whispered
knowingly that this story was all a fabrication: that
&lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck had finally deserted him and
that the shot had been fired inside, not outside, the room. Ugly
rumors such as these flew through the streets, but whether they
reached the ears of the Kid nobody ever knew. Perhaps they did.
Perhaps that was why he sold his place two weeks later and without
so much as saying good-by to anybody he caught the next down-river
boat.</p>

<p>When Jim Rowan closed the door of his steamer stateroom behind
him, he closed it, as he thought, upon The Michigan Kid and
everything that had to do with that notorious character. Then when
the first bend of the river had hidden Dawson City from view he
drew from his pocket a wallet, and from this he carefully extracted
a blurry, time-yellowed picture of Rose Morris. It was a picture he
had clipped from a Dover newspaper on the day Rose graduated from
the local high school and it showed her as a girl in white with a
floppy hat and a sash of ribbon, about her waist. It was perhaps
the one and only personal possession that he had never risked
losing at some time or other. He gazed at it now for quite a while.
He wondered if Rose were still alive. If so, she must have grown
into a beautiful woman, yes, and a good woman&mdash;here the
gambler was speaking. No doubt she was married. He pondered this
thought deliberately and it awakened a feeling of regret too
indefinite to be called a pang, for long ago he had realized that
it was not the flesh-and-blood Rose Morris that he worshiped, but
an idea and an ideal. Of course he proposed to find her&mdash;that
was the one thing he had in mind&mdash;but what would happen when
he had found her was another matter. If she were married and happy
and if she remembered the Rowan kid who used to carry milk and
drive a dray and do odd jobs around Dover, he might even show her
the faded picture and tell her how he had made of her a fetish, a
star to guide him along the course of success. He could find a way
to tell her that without offense. Any good woman would be pleased
to know that her girlish purity, her charm, and her beauty had been
a man&rsquo;s inspiration. Of course he wouldn&rsquo;t tell her
just how he had made good. No need of spoiling a beautiful
thing.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, she were not married, and if she did not
remember that poor, low-bred Rowan kid too distinctly&mdash;well,
there again was something to think about!</p>

<p>This latter possibility impelled him to rise and stare at
himself in the stateroom mirror. What he saw made him realize one
price at least which he had paid for his money. He was still too
young to have laid on fat, but his cheeks were soft and pallid.
Gone, too, was the animation and the vivacity that lights young
faces. His face was a mask&mdash;a mask of putty&mdash;even the
eyes were cold and emotionless. They were the eyes of a man three
times his age. It was The Michigan Kid who stared out from that
glass and Jim Rowan admitted that he did not like the looks of the
fellow.</p>

<p>There were a few people on the river boat who knew him, but when
he boarded the steamship at St. Michael he saw no familiar faces,
and, inasmuch as his name meant nothing to his fellow passengers,
he felt a great relief. Already he had begun to realize, as he had
not realized in Dawson, that whatever The Michigan Kid may have
stood for on the upper river, back home that name would stand for
something altogether different. Back home! The words possess a
peculiar significance for men who have not been
&ldquo;outside&rdquo; in more than five years. Nobody but the
homeward-bound Alaskan can in the least appreciate them.</p>

<p>At Nome the ship hove to for twenty-four hours, and Rowan went
ashore to see what the place looked like. Here again he passed
unnoticed, and he was greatly cheered by that fact. If he could
walk the streets of an Alaskan gold camp without being recognized,
it argued that he would have no difficulty whatever in the big
world outside.</p>

<p>His attention was attracted by a poster which advertised an
informal rally of all the citizens of Nome who hailed from
Michigan. The meeting was to be held that night for the purpose of
general good-fellowship and acquaintanceship and with the ultimate
view of organizing a Wolverine Society. Jim decided to go.</p>

<p>It turned out to be a pleasant gathering. A glad-hand committee
was at the door to introduce strangers around; there was a program
of entertainment, with refreshments promised afterward. Ice cream
and cake! Jim Rowan grinned. Here was old home stuff. He wondered
what these pleasant-faced men and women would think if they knew
that he, the unobtrusive visitor, was The Michigan Kid, the most
notorious &ldquo;sporting man&rdquo; in all the north. They would
probably ask him to leave. He heard his name mentioned during the
evening&mdash;when a judge from Lansing delivered a speech
eulogizing the home state and referred to the Kid as &ldquo;that
unsavory character of the upper Yukon who has brought odium upon
the fair name of our birthplace.&rdquo; Again Jim grinned. Well, he
had the money, anyhow. One has to pay something for success.</p>

<p>Nowhere did he hear a name or see a face that he knew, with
perhaps one exception&mdash;the face of an old man who sat in a
quiet corner. It was a bearded face and the man was poorly dressed.
He wore rubber boots and overalls and a faded, threadbare mackinaw
that hung loosely from his stooping shoulders. His hair was thin
and gray and he coughed a good deal. He appeared to be quite as
friendless as Rowan. Jim studied the old fellow&rsquo;s profile and
decided that he had probably seen the man across the gambling table
or the bar&mdash;a river of derelicts like this one had flowed in
and out of his place during these recent years. He had about put
him out of his mind when the man rose to leave. Then Rowan started,
leaned forward; his eyes fixed themselves upon the stranger&rsquo;s
bearded cheek. Just under the cheek bone and half hidden in the
edge of the beard he saw a scar, and all at once the tall,
slouching figure assumed lines and peculiarities he knew. There
could be no mistake: it was Hiram Morris, Rose&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>Jim rose and followed the man out of the building. Hiram Morris
here! In Alaska! It was incredible. More incredible still was it to
recognize in this bent figure of discouragement the once mighty man
of Michigan, the colossus of Jim&rsquo;s youth.</p>

<p>Mr. Morris shuffled along the street, shaking his head and
muttering to himself. As he passed the entrance to a bakery whence
issued the savory odors of fresh bread, pies, and spicy cakes he
paused, lifted his face, and breathed deeply. He halted again
before a restaurant inside the show window of which were displayed
raw steaks and chops and cold-storage chickens upon a bed of
cracked ice.</p>

<p>Jim recognized the expression in that thin, eager face and he
experienced a shock. Good God! the man was hungry! Hungry in
Alaska! Nobody had ever gone hungry on the Yukon. What kind of camp
was this? Jim uttered a whispered oath. He&rsquo;d damn soon fix
this.</p>

<p>Holding his voice to a casual tone, he said: &ldquo;Excuse me,
but I&rsquo;m looking for a clean cafe. Can you tell me where the
gamblers eat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right here, I believe. It is the most expensive place in
town.&rdquo; The speaker&rsquo;s gaze remained fixed upon the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a stranger here and I don&rsquo;t know a soul.
Won&rsquo;t you join me?&rdquo; Mr. Morris looked up now, swiftly:
in his eyes was a glitter that Rowan had seen in the eyes of
famished trail dogs. &ldquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t know me!
Besides&mdash;I&rsquo;m not dressed for a place like this. I thank
you, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on. You&rsquo;ll be doing me a favor.&rdquo; Jim
held the door open and waited for the ragged figure to precede him,
then he selected a table in one of the booths and ordered a meal
for two which caused his guest to say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, you can&rsquo;t be familiar with Nome
prices. A T-bone steak is seven dollars and&mdash;those fresh
vegetables! Why, you&rsquo;ve ordered a millionaire&rsquo;s
banquet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it is a sort of banquet with me. It celebrates an
occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I met an old friend to-night: a man from my home town. He
did a lot for me when I was a kid and this is such a real event
that I&rsquo;d celebrate it if it took my last dollar. Now then,
tell me something about this camp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Morris was ready and, willing to talk about Nome. He had
failed greatly and he was at a garrulous age, but about himself he
had little to say and it was some time before Jim managed to
discover that he had been here for two years, mining, but without
success.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know how it is,&rdquo; he explained with a tremulous
smile; &ldquo;it takes time to develop a placer property when you
have no capital. But I have a splendid claim and one of these days
I&rsquo;ll land in the pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two men chatted on until their food was served, and,
inasmuch as the host had not seen fit to introduce himself, the
guest did not make himself known. It was not until the latter had
eaten ravenously, to his complete satisfaction, and had lighted an
expensive cigar of Jim&rsquo;s selection, that the younger man
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;d like to hear about that old friend I
met. He was a big man in our town and I was a poor kid, but he gave
me some advice that I&rsquo;ve tried to live up to. It came about
like this: one morning we were having a snowball fight in front of
the school-house when he drove past in his cutter.&rdquo; Mr.
Morris peered curiously at the speaker. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what possessed me, but I threw a ball at him. It was ice. It hit
him, hurt him like the devil. I&rsquo;d have been fired from school
only for him. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where was this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was in Dover. You took me to the principal
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, this is extraordinary! Then your name
is&mdash;Rowan. You&rsquo;re Jim Rowan&rsquo;s boy. And you
recognized me, after all these years!&rdquo; Mr. Morris was deeply
moved; his weary face was shining; his eyes had grown bright.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t fail to recognize that scar on your
cheek, sir, inasmuch as I put it there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy!&rdquo; The old man took Jim&rsquo;s hand in
both of his. &ldquo;How strange that we should meet like this! And
how you fooled me! You had your little joke, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Merely because I wasn&rsquo;t sure you&rsquo;d accept my
invitation to dine if you knew who I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Morris confessed reluctantly: &ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not
sure that I would have accepted, Jim. You see, times have changed;
things haven&rsquo;t gone well with me and it hurts a man&rsquo;s
pride to acknowledge failure to his friends. I have some pride
left. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not going back until I land in the
pay. Now that you know everything, I&rsquo;m going to make a
confession: I was&mdash;actually hungry when you invited me
in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hell of a camp, to let a man go hungry!&rdquo; Rowan
exclaimed, harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, I&rsquo;m pretty old and I&rsquo;m not very
strong. It&rsquo;s hard for me to get work. However, a little
poverty, a little hardship, doesn&rsquo;t hurt anybody. It makes
one enjoy good fortune when it comes. But, Jim, my boy, tell me
about yourself. How did I ever help you? You must have struck it
rich to be able to afford an extravagance like this&mdash;this
banquet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rowan shrugged. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a little and I&rsquo;ve
spent a little. You made me promise to fight fair and never hit a
fellow when he wasn&rsquo;t looking. I could have made more if I
hadn&rsquo;t lived up to that promise, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Crooked money isn&rsquo;t worth having and
money of any sort isn&rsquo;t worth too high a price. This is a
cruel country and it&rsquo;s hard to get ahead. But you&rsquo;re
young and you&rsquo;ve taken good care of yourself.&rdquo; Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s failing eyes did not see that Jim&rsquo;s flesh was
flabby and that the bleach in his cheeks came from lack of
sunlight. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your early training. I&rsquo;ve no
sympathy for these wasters who squander their money over bars and
gambling tables.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rowan nodded gravely; he spoke the literal truth when he said:
&ldquo;Neither have I.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of date, perhaps, but I still retain my
old-fashioned ideas. I daresay I don&rsquo;t belong
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can I?&rdquo; The question was accompanied by a
crooked smile and a regretful shake of the gray head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But your family&mdash;?&rdquo; With a gambler&rsquo;s
caution Jim was leading up to the question that had trembled upon
his lips from the moment he had first recognized Rose&rsquo;s
father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Morris died several years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry. I haven&rsquo;t heard from home in
ages.&rdquo; There was a moment of silence, then with averted eyes
and in a tone of indifference the younger man said, &ldquo;Your
daughter Rose must be a woman now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hiram Morris looked up eagerly. &ldquo;Yes. Yes, indeed! A
lovely, sweet girl.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Married, no doubt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. But some day I hope her Prince Charming will come
along. Poor Rose, she deserves a prince! She&rsquo;d love to see
you, I know, but&mdash;I&rsquo;m afraid her pride is stiffer than
mine. You understand. She feels our situation
keenly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean she&rsquo;s&mdash;here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes! Where else would she be? She&rsquo;s all I
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rowan felt himself grow dizzy, ill. Rose here! Dependent upon
this poor, feeble old man whom he had surprised staring at a cafe
window like a famished wolf! It was a moment before he could trust
himself to inquire: &ldquo;Where is she? What is she
doing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s out on the creek. I came in to look for a
man, a helper, but&mdash;I can&rsquo;t pay wages and nobody cares
to prospect a claim for an interest in it when there are so many
claims to be had for the staking, or to be jumped. We&rsquo;ve
about reached the end of our rope. I saw the notice of that
Michigan meeting and I thought I might find somebody
there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; said Rowan. When Morris looked at him
uncomprehendingly, he explained: &ldquo;You found me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my boy! You don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understand perfectly. You want a working partner and
you&rsquo;ll give him an interest. All right, how much of an
interest do I get?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I was going to offer a half&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too much, just for a pick and shovel stiff.
I&rsquo;ll put up the grub and outfit for all hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You&rsquo;ve done well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not well enough so that I can afford to turn down a good
offer like this. You&rsquo;ve been here two years and you
haven&rsquo;t struck pay; I spent five years on the Yukon and never
made a dollar out of mining. I left to look for something. Well,
I&rsquo;ve found it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next morning Jim Rowan put a pack on his back and hit the
trail. It was the first time in nearly five years that he had felt
pack straps, for The Michigan Kid had taken his exercise by proxy,
and he was dismayed to discover how soft and how short of breath he
had become. He felt a pang &nbsp;when he heard the siren of his
steamer giving the signal to weigh anchor, for he was heartily sick
of the northland and hungry for the world outside. He had worked
long for this hour; he felt now as if some one had offered him a
drink then snatched it away. And the worst of it all was that he
had no doubt made a fool of himself! Rose would not&mdash;could
not be the girl he had known; nor could the faint spark of a
boyhood infatuation be fanned into the flame of a real man&rsquo;s
love, for men&rsquo;s tastes change without their knowing it. Even
if he should learn to care for her and to want her, what then? He
knew without asking that Rose shared all of her father&rsquo;s
scruples and prejudices. Lucky for him that he had buried The
Michigan Kid; he must see to it that grass grew on the grave.</p>

<p>Rose had bloomed into exactly the sort of woman that Jim had
expected, thereby disproving the cynical statement that our
realizations never equal our anticipations. She was a little more
fragile than he had pictured her, but the reason for that was
evident and it wrung his heart. Ten minutes after he saw her, heard
her voice, looked into her eyes, he had ceased all regrets about
that departed steamship.</p>

<p>She was delighted to see the boy she had known, and with her own
hands she prepared the simple supper for three. Later she sought
out Jim as he was strolling about the claim, inspecting the traces
of old Hiram&rsquo;s desultory and inefficient labors.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father tells me that you have bought a complete outfit of
supplies, and lumber for another cabin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes. They&rsquo;ll be out to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl lowered her eyes and said with some difficulty:
&ldquo;Of course you realize that they came just in time.
It&rsquo;s almost easier to take charity from strangers than from
old friends. I&rsquo;m sorry you made the sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Charity&rsquo;? &lsquo;Sacrifice&rsquo;? What
sacrifice?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father says you were on your way
&lsquo;outside&rsquo;&mdash;after five years. I know what that
means. Then you met him, heard how badly we were doing, and
&mdash;came to our rescue. It was a generous impulse, Jim. For all
I know it may have taken your last dollar&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rowan opened his lips to speak, then closed them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see?&rdquo; The girl laid her hand upon his arm.
&ldquo;Poor Don Quixote! Won&rsquo;t you think better of it and go
out to God&rsquo;s country? You&rsquo;ve earned it, Jim, and
you&rsquo;ll find your opportunity there. Father is enthusiastic,
he really believes in this claim, but I know it&rsquo;s no good,
and, besides, we&rsquo;re unlucky. Everything has gone badly since
we lost our money back there in Dover. He&rsquo;s a feeble old man
and disappointment has made him almost childish. All he has left is
that conviction that some day he&rsquo;ll land in the pay. There
are hundreds like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what would you do?&rdquo; Rowan inquired. Wearily
Rose shrugged. &ldquo;What I have always done&mdash;remain at his
side. I love him. He gave me everything when he had it to give.
I&rsquo;m the staff he leans upon and without me he&rsquo;d fall.
We can get along, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was offered a job waiting on table at the
Bonanza&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man uttered an exclamation. Roughly he said,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d sooner see you in a dance hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could even get married&mdash;&rdquo; Rose smiled
faintly.</p>

<p>Jim&rsquo;s hands twitched, but his face was impassive as he
said: &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m going to stick. I made a few dollars in
Dawson and I left there looking for one more chance&mdash;one big
chance to win or lose, make or break. I play hunches, and when your
father offered to go fifty-fifty with me I had a hunch that my
number was due. Have you ever heard of
&lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course. Aladdin&rsquo;s lamp, too, but I never
expect to have either.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who knows? I have a feeling that your troubles are over
and that your father is really going to land in the pay.
Let&rsquo;s hope so, anyhow. I believe in hoping for things until
you get them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in this manner that Jim Rowan became a miner, a
pick-and-shovel man. He put up a cabin for himself and he did his
own cooking&mdash;a thing any man abhors. Rose protested that it
was quite as easy to cook for three as for two, but Jim could not
bear to increase her labors. Although he and Hiram began to
prospect the claim, it was he who did most of the actual work. His
flabby muscles rebelled, at first; blisters grew upon his white
palms; they burst, then turned into callouses. Slowly, painfully he
hardened himself. It was an ordeal, but as his body grew strong so
did his determination to win the love of Rose Morris. He smiled now
at those early doubts of his. It was not alone an ideal that he had
worshiped, it was the flesh-and-blood girl, the woman who had
become all and more than he had imagined possible.</p>

<p>Every day he had to fight the desire to voice his love, but the
better he came to know Rose, the more fearful he became that
somehow the grave of The Michigan Kid would be disturbed and that
she would behold the skeleton it concealed&mdash;grass was slow in
growing over it&mdash;hence he showed his devotion only in the
things he did. He began by building another room upon their cabin,
a room for her, and when she protested against the expense he told
her that he was keeping books and that Mr. Morris could pay him
back when he &ldquo;landed in the pay.&rdquo; Thereafter he managed
somehow to keep the old man and his daughter in comfort, quite an
effort at restraint on his part, inasmuch as he would have welcomed
the privilege of supplying them with luxuries and extravagances.
Every dollar he spent Rose believed to be his last.</p>

<p>Autumn came and Jim put into effect a plan he had worked out. He
&ldquo;salted&rdquo; the pannings from their ground just enough to
make a showing, this being necessary to his scheme; then he
interested a purchaser in buying the claim. He instructed the man
to offer twenty thousand dollars for it, supposing, of course, that
Mr. Morris would leap at the chance to sell. But this was the first
gold the old man had ever found and those few yellow flakes
strengthened his senile conviction that the property was rich. He
refused the offer. He refused again and again, even when
Jim&rsquo;s man raised the bid to forty thousand dollars. He did
more than refuse; he boasted about the offer in town and said he
had struck regular &ldquo; &lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo;
luck.&rdquo; This caused quite a flurry of excitement and
reluctantly Jim was forced to call off his bidder.</p>

<p>His effort had an effect other than he had expected: a
forty-thousand-dollar offer for a wild-cat claim on Friday Creek
centered interest there, and promptly the Bonanza crowd sent an
outfit over and began work on some property they owned below old
Hiram&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This outfit was in charge of a young fellow by the name of
Hayward, and once he had become acquainted with Rose he took such
an interest in Friday Creek that he spent all of his time there.
This Hayward was a fine-looking, upstanding youth and he
undoubtedly had a way with him. But his way with women was more
agreeable than his way with men: towards Jim Rowan, for instance,
he displayed the same air of contemptuous superiority that he
reserved for his employees. Rose liked him, however&mdash;perhaps
that was the real reason why Jim did not. In any event, the two men
were so different in character that a clash was inevitable.</p>

<p>Jim had made it a practice never to go into town for fear of
recognition, hence it was Hiram who made the weekly trips for mail
and for the necessary purchases. One day while he was in town it
began to snow, and during the afternoon this snow turned to rain
and sleet. The old man returned about dark, quite wet and chilly.
He was a long while getting warmed through and later in the evening
he complained of feeling badly and went to bed. Jim was awakened
during the night by a knock on his door. It was Rose. In a tone
that instantly brought him to his feet she told him that her father
was ill and that she was frightened. Throwing on his clothes, he
hurried to the larger cabin. Hiram was burning up with fever; he
coughed almost continuously; he was in pain. Jim announced at once
that he would go for a doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send somebody up from the Bonanza camp,&rdquo;
he told the girl, &ldquo;because I won&rsquo;t be able to get back
before morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rose turned eyes dark with apprehension upon him.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s very ill, isn&rsquo;t he? He woke me up
muttering. Hear him&mdash;? It&rsquo;s all about &lsquo;landing in
the pay.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s a pretty sick man.
There&rsquo;s a medicine case somewhere among my things. Look until
you find it. And don&rsquo;t allow yourself to become panicky. Be a
brave girl, Rose.&rdquo; He laid a hand upon Rose&rsquo;s
shoulder&mdash;it was the first time he had ever touched her except
by inadvertence&mdash;and there was such sympathy, such comfort in
his gesture that tears wet her lashes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a dear. I
don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d do without you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Young Hayward was in Nome, but Jim got one of the Bonanza men to
go to Rose&rsquo;s assistance and also he borrowed a horse for
himself. It was not many miles to town, but it was a wretched night
and he was glad when the animal wallowed out of the icy mud and he
felt the plank pavements under its feet. The first doctor he found
was ill; another had been called to Fort Davis; the third was
engaged on a confinement case, but promised to accompany Jim in
perhaps two hours. There was nothing to do but wait.</p>

<p>Jim was wet and cold. He stabled his horse, returned to the main
street, and entered the first saloon he came to. It was late; there
was nobody at the bar, but some of the games were still running and
there were a few figures at the lunch counter in the rear. Thither
Jim made his way in search of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>There was a stage at the end of the place where, in the earlier
hours of the night, a vaudeville show was given, and at the piano
were gathered several weary women of the dance-hall type. One of
them saw Jim and spoke to her companions, whereupon they turned and
stared curiously at his back.</p>

<p>Young Hayward rose from the faro table and approached the lunch
counter. He had been drinking some and losing considerably. There
was an unpleasant curl to his lips.</p>

<p>Jim had hitched himself upon one of the high stools; he had
raised his mug to drink when Hayward pushed it away from his lips
and called to the white-aproned waiter, saying:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Give this fellow a square meal.&rdquo; At the same
time he crashed a twenty-dollar gold piece upon the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said Jim. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
hungry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ham and eggs for a friend of mine,&rdquo; Hayward cried.
&ldquo;And give him the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim eyed the speaker coldly, as if from behind a mask, but he
appeared to take no notice of the tone Hayward had used. Still in
an even voice he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nice of you. I&rsquo;ve seen the time I&rsquo;d take
it.&rdquo; He lifted his cup for a second time; again Hayward took
his wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Rowan. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to ask you
something. It&rsquo;s about that offer for old-man Morris&rsquo;s
claim. D&rsquo;you know what I think?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re capable of thinking,
right now. If I were you, Hayward, I&rsquo;d go home and go to
bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; Hayward&rsquo;s disagreeable smile
became more pronounced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think; I
think it was phony. I think you tried to put something
over&mdash;tried to grab something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well? You can&rsquo;t arrest a man for trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you something else: old-man Morris is
honest, but I think he&rsquo;s in partners with a damned
crook.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men eyed each other. Very quietly Jim said: &ldquo;So!
You&rsquo;re just spoiling for trouble, aren&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With you, yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but I can&rsquo;t oblige you
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ha! Nor any other night. I&rsquo;ve discovered something
else about you, Rowan. You haven&rsquo;t got the guts of a guinea
pig.&rdquo; Hayward had not lowered his voice during this colloquy.
Those people in the rear of the room had heard most of what he
said, and they were looking on now in mingled curiosity and
apprehension. The dance-hall girl who had pointed out Jim whispered
excitedly to her companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny what a fool a man can make of himself,&rdquo; Jim
told the young foreman. &ldquo;Some day you&rsquo;ll realize how
badly up against it a fellow can get without knowing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bah! You rat! There&rsquo;s only one way to treat
a&mdash;&rdquo; Hayward raised his open hand to slap this object of
contempt, but the blow did not descend; he did not finish his
sentence, for suddenly his face was deluged by the blinding,
scalding contents of Jim&rsquo;s coffee cup. With an exclamation he
reeled backward, almost into the arms of the women at the piano. He
dashed the liquid from his face; with his sleeve he wiped his eyes,
cleared them; he gathered himself to rush upon the figure still
sitting motionless upon the high stool. But one of the girls flung
herself upon him, twined her arms about him, and in a voice
high-pitched, vibrant with warning, she cried:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t touch him, Hayward! He&rsquo;ll kill you!
God, man, that&rsquo;s &lsquo;The Michigan Kid.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p>

<p>Hayward&rsquo;s struggle died suddenly. It came still-born. Into
his purple face crept a look of astonishment, then incredulity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&mdash;? I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; Manifestly
he was still shaken by the urge to destroy, but indecision
paralyzed him.</p>

<p>By this time other hands had seized him; he heard the voice of
the faro dealer saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s him, all right. Close
your trap and beat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the Kid stared silently at the tableau, then he
revolved upon his stool until he faced the spellbound waiter across
the counter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ham and eggs and a cup of coffee for a friend of Mr.
Hayward&rsquo;s!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take it out of that twenty
and keep the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hayward was propelled towards the front of the house and,
although he cursed and glared over his shoulder and mouthed threats
as he went, it required no great exercise of strength to speed his
going.</p>

<p>Hiram Morris was too sick to be moved. The doctor pronounced it
pneumonia and for Rose and Jim there commenced a period of
sleepless anxiety. He moved her into his cabin and tried to force
her to take some rest, but as for him he did not remove his clothes
and scarcely closed his eyes for nearly a week. Then Mr. Morris
died. He had muttered almost constantly; the last words they heard
him whisper were those of his favorite prophecy, &ldquo;Some day
I&rsquo;ll land in the pay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That experience forever remained in Jim Rowan&rsquo;s memory as
a black, depressing nightmare. To Rose, of course, it was something
infinitely worse, vastly more terrifying. During the long hours of
uncertainty she had leaned upon him, and in her final grief she put
her head upon his shoulder and wept. It gave him the keenest pang
of all to be unable to take her in his arms and comfort her.</p>

<p>There followed the customary melancholy preparation and
formalities. There were still a few women left on the creeks near
by and these did what they could for Rose. Jim tried to induce her
to go home with one of them, but this she would not consent to do.
She insisted upon remaining until her father had been laid to rest,
then willingly enough she promised to leave this place which had
been the scene of such pain, such poverty, and such sorrow. It was
she who selected a burial place, upon the north &ldquo;rim&rdquo;
of the creek&mdash;a high bench that paralleled the bottom and that
looked out across the tundra towards the open sea. It was a spot
that in winter was sheltered from the icy blasts; in summer it was
brilliant with wildflowers, lush with tender grasses, and fragrant
with blooms&mdash;a pleasant place for a gentle, broken old man to
sleep. Other hands were ready to dig the grave, but this was a
labor that Jim Rowan reserved for his own.</p>

<p>In due time he began it. Fortunately, the rim was well drained
and, once he had picked through the thin crust of autumn frost, the
gravel was dry and he made good progress. He had finished his
melancholy task and was about to climb out of the pit, when he
noticed a peculiar reddish tinge to the gravel beneath his feet. He
took a heaping shovelful of it and, descending to the creek, he
stamped a hole through the ice and idly &ldquo;panned&rdquo; it on
the shovel blade.</p>

<p>He was engaged thus when young Hayward and two of his men
approached. Jim rose and leaned upon his shovel handle. He supposed
these were the first arrivals for the funeral, but Hayward
explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came up early to have a word with you,
Rowan.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you said about everything, the other
night,&rdquo; Jim told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in any humor
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was drunk! I made a fool of myself. Now that I know
who you are, I&rsquo;ve come prepared.&rdquo; Jim stared
incredulously at the speaker; harshly he inquired: &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t mean to say you intend to start something
to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. I came up to serve notice on you.
I&rsquo;ve learned how you met Mr. Morris and came out here, and I
understand why you came. But Rose doesn&rsquo;t understand. She
doesn&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re The Michigan Kid; she thinks
you&rsquo;re just the old friend of the family, her little playmate
from the home town. She doesn&rsquo;t know it was you that offered
forty thousand dollars for this claim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. She doesn&rsquo;t know any of those things. I
suppose you intend to tell her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do. Unless you have enough decency left to behave like
a man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you figure a man would behave?&rdquo; Jim asked.
&ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s all hearsay with you, but I&rsquo;m
curious to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hayward flushed. &ldquo;Never mind that line of talk. I came to
give you a quiet word of warning but if you want to get nasty, why,
just write your own ticket. I&rsquo;m ready to take you on now, or
later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see. That&rsquo;s why you brought help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker&rsquo;s color deepened. &ldquo;Listen, Rowan! I know
what happened to that Englishman, Thompson. He didn&rsquo;t have
any friends with him; the witnesses were all your friends.
I&rsquo;ve heard about a lot of your other fights, too&mdash;if you
can call &rsquo;em that&mdash;and I&rsquo;ve had a dozen warnings
to lay off of you, so I provided my own witnesses. Now here&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ve got to say&mdash;after the ceremony, you
duck!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what will happen to Rose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to that. She has friends enough to see
her through.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t duck, I suppose you&rsquo;ll tell her
I&rsquo;m a gambler and that I offered to buy her father&rsquo;s
claim for ten times what it&rsquo;s worth. That&rsquo;ll certainly
shock her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you had a reason for that offer&mdash;more of your
&ldquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; luck,&rsquo; probably! I understand
you did most of the panning. Funny about that luck of yours,
isn&rsquo;t it? Funny how everybody loses when they play you. You
were crooked in Dawson and you couldn&rsquo;t even play straight
with Rose and her father. It&rsquo;s perfectly obvious why you came
out here in the first place. Hell! Men like you ought to be shot
for looking at a girl like her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Hayward, I&rsquo;m not going until I get
ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have it your own way. But take it from me, your
&lsquo;luck&rsquo; has run out.&rdquo; The Bonanza foreman turned
and walked down the creek, followed by his two watchful
companions.</p>

<p>It was a dismal travesty of a funeral that occurred late that
afternoon. A clergyman and a half dozen of Mr. Morris&rsquo;s
acquaintances had driven out from town, but even including them,
there were not twenty people who followed the pine box as it was
carried across the thin autumn snow and up to its resting
place.</p>

<p>Rose was a brave but a pitiful figure. During the final
depressing rites Jim Rowan&rsquo;s heart bled for her. He it was
who let fall the first shovelful of earth. When the grave had been
filled in he saw that Hayward and the clergyman had taken her back
down to the cabin.</p>

<p>Jim had secured a team with which to drive the girl in to town,
and while the visitors were bidding her good-by he went to his own
shack and began putting his few belongings together.</p>

<p>He was mystified when he could not lay his hand upon the little
leather case with the old newspaper portrait of Rose, for that was
about all that he really cared to take with him. He looked
everywhere for it before he finally gave up the search. He had
refused Hayward&rsquo;s warning to leave, not because he expected
Rose to reconcile herself to his past, not because he now retained
the faintest hope of ever realizing his dream, but because there
was something yet to be done, and, moreover, because it was not his
nature to come or to go at any man&rsquo;s bidding. Hayward,
without doubt, would tell her the truth, sooner or later&mdash;for
that matter she would learn it anyhow, once she got to
town&mdash;and it might as well come from his lips as from
another&rsquo;s. Under the circumstances, therefore, it seemed as
if &ldquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rdquo; luck had indeed about run its
course. Whatever came to pass, however, Rose&rsquo;s future could
not be left to chance.</p>

<p>He was interrupted in his task by the girl herself. She came to
his door and with her she brought Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;Mr. Hayward has been trying
to tell me something&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Already?&rdquo; A flame leaped into Rowan&rsquo;s
eyes as he turned them upon the Bonanza foreman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, already! It&rsquo;s best to have it out and over
with,&rdquo; the latter declared, doggedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked him to say it before you, Jim if&mdash;if he
insists upon saying it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I merely started to tell her why she couldn&rsquo;t
afford to have anything further to do with you,&rdquo; the visitor
announced. &ldquo;I tried to tell her that I love her and want to
marry her; that I&rsquo;ll give her a home and end all of her
troubles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was it you said about Jim?&rdquo; the girl insisted
quietly.</p>

<p>Hayward told her; frankly, brutally he repeated what he had
previously said. Jim listened in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; Rose turned a strained, white face
upon The Michigan Kid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of it is. Not that about the killing of Thompson, of
course. He shot himself because he had lost company money. He came
to break me, but the game was square&mdash;all my games were
square, and he knew it. I just had my usual luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose, will you let me take you to town?&rdquo; Hayward
asked, earnestly.</p>

<p>Slowly the girl shook her head. &ldquo;Jim has arranged to drive
me in. I&rsquo;m sorry you didn&rsquo;t wait a while
before&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had a good deal to bear.&rdquo; When the
young man scowled at Rowan and opened his lips to protest, she
smiled faintly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be perfectly safe with him. The
Michigan Kid hasn&rsquo;t been accused of killing women, has
he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well. I&rsquo;m sorry, too, that it had to come at a
time like this. But I thought it best. I&rsquo;ll see you
to-morrow, Rose. Forgive me if I&rsquo;ve been rough. It&rsquo;s
only because&mdash;&rdquo; The speaker stammered, choked, then he
turned and went out into the chill twilight.</p>

<p>When the crunch of his footsteps had died out Rose inquired,
simply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why did you do it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Rowan answered carelessly: &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m just naturally a
bad sort, I guess! No great amount of character. I wanted money,
and gambling was the easiest way to get it. I always hated work. Of
course I had to be tough to get by; they kept me in hot water so
long I got hard-boiled&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that. Why did you come out here with
father, the way you did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now, I&rsquo;m not sure that I can explain unless it
was because of that hunch I told you about,&rdquo; Jim managed a
splendid assumption of sincerity. &ldquo;We gamblers play hunches,
you know. And say, it just proves there&rsquo;s something in them.
A mighty queer thing happened to-day, Rose. I didn&rsquo;t mean to
tell you yet, but your father was right. There&rsquo;s pay on this
claim!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Rose, listen! While I was digging up there on the
rim the gravel looked good. I took some of it down to the creek and
tested it. I can&rsquo;t begin to guess what was in it, but it was
rich. You&rsquo;re a rich woman. There&rsquo;s no mistake. It
wasn&rsquo;t a &lsquo;prospect,&rsquo; it was big pay, coarse
gold!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a while the girl sat silent, then abruptly she hid her face
in her hands.&ldquo;Oh! The pity of it!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;After he had worked so long and endured so much! Poor
father! So patient, so gentle, so old&mdash;!&rdquo; Tears stole
through her fingers.</p>

<p>Jim dared not try to comfort this grief; he could not even trust
himself to show the sympathy he felt. In a cheerful, matter-of-fact
voice, he said: &ldquo;He told us he would land in the pay and we
wouldn&rsquo;t believe him. But I know he&rsquo;s glad, for it was
you he wanted it for, not himself, and everything has come out just
the way he would have had it. I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bet he&rsquo;s
happy at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;Michigan&rsquo;s&rsquo; luck still holds good,
doesn&rsquo;t it? Half the claim is yours, Jim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! That &lsquo;partnership&rsquo; arrangement was a
joke. I&rsquo;ve got money, lots of it. I could have made things a
good deal easier for him and for you, but I didn&rsquo;t dare. No,
Rose, it&rsquo;s all yours and you have nothing to worry about any
more. You needn&rsquo;t pay any attention to what Hayward said,
unless you want to. I know you like him and&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
mighty nice boy. He has courage and he loves you. He&rsquo;s a
good, clean fellow&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Jim, I don&rsquo;t love him. I don&rsquo;t even like
him, any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Rowan declared,
heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love somebody else.&rdquo; The girl lifted her
tear-stained face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in love with a boy from our old
town. I think I must have cared for him ever since I was a little
girl. And I&rsquo;ve been in his thoughts, too. He has carried my
picture constantly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well! That&rsquo;s certainly nice.&rdquo; Jim could
think of nothing else to say. It required some effort to say that
much, and mean it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an unselfish boy. He did a great deal for
father. I think he&rsquo;d give his life for me. And yet he has
never said that he loves me. I had to find it out by
chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rose!&rdquo; All the reserve, all the counterfeit
cheerfulness of The Michigan Kid, fell away. It was Jim Rowan, the
Dover boy, who stared at her with working face, and exclaimed in a
voice suddenly grown hoarse, &ldquo;You&mdash;found that
picture!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; that night when I was looking for medicine. How long
have you had it, Jim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever since the day you graduated. I&rsquo;ve always loved
you, ever since I was a ragged kid and you drove by in your wicker
pony cart. Rose dear, it was because of you that I gambled. I
wanted money. I think I&rsquo;d have killed to get it&mdash;almost.
I went through hell. Then when I had my money and had found you I
went through hell again because&mdash;well, because of the hell
I&rsquo;d been through. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m not much of a man.
I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve made a mistake&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Jim did not finish, for the girl held up her arms to him and
said, quaveringly, like a weary child: &ldquo;Take me, Jim. Please!
I&rsquo;m&mdash;so tired!&rdquo;</p>

<p>So it was that The Michigan Kid&rsquo;s luck held through to the
finish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1 align="center"><strong><a name="Powder" id=
"Powder"></a>Powder</strong>
</h1>

<p>Ben Furlong came to the Southern oil fields looking for work. He
found it promptly. Seldom, it may be said, did any newcomer land a
job more quickly than he, for inside of eighteen hours after his
arrival he was on the chain gang and for sixty days thereafter he
labored for the sovereign State of Texas. It all came about because
of Mr. Furlong&rsquo;s vest.</p>

<p>Ben stepped off the train with sixty dollars upon his person,
capital sufficient for any practical oil man in any producing
field, but that very evening some new acquaintances invited him
into a crap game. Now in Pennsylvania, where Ben hailed from, craps
was a pastime, a game of chance indulged in by amateurs purely for
purposes of amusement; it was not an exact science nor a means of
livelihood, as here. As a result of that free, expansive Texas
hospitality Mr. Furlong spent the still and sleepy hours of his
first night on a bench in the railroad station.</p>

<p>In the morning he pawned his vest. Vests are useless adornments
in a hot country, but he finally found a second-hand shop the
proprietor of which agreed to advance him &ldquo;two bits&rdquo; on
this one. It was a trifling transaction, but important to the
visitor, who badly felt the need of a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>The owner of that vest had explored its pocket at least a dozen
times during the night. What was his surprise, therefore, when the
nimble-fingered purchaser found in it a twenty-five-cent piece that
somehow had worked through a rip in the pocket lining and into a
resting place that had entirely escaped the clumsy digits of its
wearer.</p>

<p>Enthusiastically Mr. Furlong thanked the discoverer and held out
his hand, but the latter grinned derisively and pocketed the coin.
Thereupon an argument developed. The oil man contended that he had
pawned the vest, not its contents; the merchant advanced the
ancient common-law doctrine of &ldquo;finders keepers, losers
weepers.&rdquo; Eventually Furlong went over the counter after his
money and got it. The tussle was brief, but when he emerged from
the pawnshop a moment later he walked directly into the arms of a
policeman, proving that this pressure upon the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
windpipe had not been sufficient to totally paralyze the
latter&rsquo;s vocal cords.</p>

<p>After hearing both sides of the story the guardian of the peace
decided that his timely arrival had broken up a mild case of
highway robbery complicated with incipient assault and battery, and
later the police magistrate concurred in some such view. At any
rate, Furlong soon found himself a member of the street gang, and
for sixty days thereafter he toiled at numerous degrading tasks
under the watchful eye of a gentleman with a long mustache and a
sawed-off shotgun. The weather was hot and he did not feel the need
of his vest.</p>

<p>This experience soured Furlong upon Texas municipalities of the
larger sort, and when at last he was free to go where he wished he
left town. He begged a ride from the friendly driver of a pipe
truck bound out into the country, and by nightfall he was among the
oil derricks. Chance led him to the little town of Opportunity.</p>

<p>Opportunity was a product of the recent petroleum excitement.
Originally it had consisted of a general store, a blacksmith shop,
a church, and a few farmhouses clustered about a dusty crossroads,
but, following the discovery of liquid gold, it had grown into
something uncommon, something quite extraordinary as towns go. To
begin with, it was amazingly ugly. Oil derricks were everywhere,
for the town site lay directly over a pool of exceeding richness,
and in places these structures stood so close together that their
straddling legs interlocked and necessity had compelled the owners
to board them in to prevent the oil from spraying over their
neighbors. The town itself was stained and spattered with
it&mdash;streets, houses, residents alike&mdash;and three times the
place had been wiped out by fire when some pipe line had burst or a
gusher had been ignited. It was built upon the ashes of itself; its
yards were paved with cinders and when the midday sun shone upon
them they radiated a cruel heat. Back of every store and residence
was a dugout&mdash;a dirt-covered storm cellar&mdash;fashioned as
a refuge against the next conflagration.</p>

<p>No, there was nothing alluring about Opportunity except its
name. Places of entertainment it had, to be sure, for on Saturday
nights when the crews came in it resembled some frontier mining
camp at the height of its boom, and relaxation was a necessity; but
prohibition had come and in Texas the Law rode herd on all
recognized forms of vice. In consequence its pleasures were
denatured. Instead of palaces of sin it had soft-drink stands, each
one enveloped in a swarm of flies; for pure amusement it maintained
a roller-skating rink. The rumble issuing from this latter sink of
iniquity during its busy hours could be heard for half a mile and
resembled the roar of a stamp mill or the sound of a heavy
surf.</p>

<p>Ben Furlong canvassed this town for work, but he was
unsuccessful, and after a day or so he went afield. He managed
somehow to eat and to find places in which to sleep, but nowhere
did he encounter a job. He was very dusty and quite hungry when at
last he stopped in at the Durham house.</p>

<p>Experience had taught him by this time that it was more
profitable to beg favors from the permanent residents of the
country than from the visitors, such as well-drillers, casing
crews, and the like, for in the farmhouses there were women and Ben
had good luck with women. They liked him. Usually, also, there was
a barn to sleep in and odd jobs which needed doing and which paid
for a meal.</p>

<p>This was a rather better-looking place than the average Texas
homestead, and when he knocked at the kitchen door a girl appeared
who was very much better-looking than the average Texas
homesteader. She was, in fact, a very pretty girl.</p>

<p>She readily fetched Ben a drink of water, and while he rested
she talked to him. That was, no doubt, because of his smile. He
informed her that he had been raised in the Pennsylvania fields and
was a good, practical oil man; then noting her expression of doubt,
he warned her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never judge a horse by his harness! These pants are on
their last legs, but that&rsquo;s the fault of the vest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With unquenchable cheerfulness he recounted his unfortunate
experience with the pawnbroker, and his manner of telling the story
made the girl laugh. That led to food. There being no chores to do,
Ben sat in the kitchen and chatted with the girl while she cooked
something for him, and in the course of their conversation he
learned that her name was Betty Durham, that her parents were dead,
and that the farm belonged to her aunt, with whom she had lived
ever since she was a little girl. The aunt had gone to Opportunity
in the family flivver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny, you cooking for a tramp driller like me and your
aunt owning acreage like this,&rdquo; Ben remarked.
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this land on the structure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! It&rsquo;s worth a lot of money. That well over
yonder&rdquo;&mdash;fork in hand, Miss Durham indicated a derrick
not far away&mdash;&ldquo;belongs to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From where he sat Furlong could see that the timbers of the
tower were still bright and unstained, thus advertising the
melancholy fact that the well itself was not a producer, so he
inquired: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with it? Dry?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dry nothing! They&rsquo;re not down yet. They&rsquo;ve
got a fishing job&mdash;been at it for a couple of
weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; The visitor shook his head.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s running somebody in debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I reckon we know it. Aunt Mary&rsquo;s crazy. Maddox sent
her to town for a new fishing tool. Tiller Maddox, he&rsquo;s our
driller. It&rsquo;s Aunt Mary&rsquo;s well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong opened his eyes in genuine astonishment. &ldquo;You mean
your aunt is putting it down with her own money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean just that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is like a dream, having ham and eggs cooked by an
heiress!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Durham laughed lightly. &ldquo;Sudden money certainly makes
a change in people and we&rsquo;ll probably do like the others when
we get ours. A lot of folks in this county are too good to cook ham
and eggs nowadays, but they weren&rsquo;t awhile back. Most of them
were lucky to have the ham. Of course we&rsquo;re not rich yet,
but&mdash;It&rsquo;s this way: when the first oil talk commenced
we&rsquo;d of been glad to get the farm drilled on most any kind of
royalty, but nobody would lease it. When they finally got ready,
Aunt Mary wanted a bonus&mdash;two bits an acre&mdash;and she
wouldn&rsquo;t listen to Uncle Joe&rsquo;s arguments. By and bye
they offered two bits, but by that time she wanted a dollar. When
they offered a dollar she changed her mind and asked ten, and then
when they were willing to pay ten she jumped to a hundred.
She&rsquo;s awfully ambitious, that way. That&rsquo;s what this
talk of quick money did to her. Then the companies got together, or
the boom kind of petered out, or something, and it began to look as
if Uncle Joe would be lucky to make any kind of a deal. He finally
laid his ears back and leased a small block. Then he up and got
killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was an accident. A powder wagon let go.&rdquo; The
speaker&rsquo;s face grew wistful, she stared out across the arid
countryside for a moment or two. &ldquo;Uncle Joe loved me,
but&mdash;Aunt Mary&rsquo;s his second wife; we&rsquo;re not really
kinfolks. It might just as well have been Maddox who got killed; he
was as close to the wagon as Uncle Joe and yet he wasn&rsquo;t
touched. Funny, too, because he&rsquo;s always been afraid of the
stuff and has a hunch he&rsquo;ll be blown up. All you have to say
to him is &lsquo;powder&rsquo; and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d your aunt come to put down this new
well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller drilled the one on that block we leased, and after
Uncle Joe was killed he quit the company and sort of took charge of
things for Aunt Mary. It wasn&rsquo;t a big well, but the royalty
is enough to pay for this one. If it comes in&mdash;well, I
won&rsquo;t cook any more ham and eggs, so you&rsquo;d better make
the most of these. Yes, and you&rsquo;d better come and get them;
they&rsquo;re done.&rdquo; Miss Durham set a plate on the table and
Furlong drew up his chair.</p>

<p>With the curiosity natural to his calling, the visitor inquired
more specifically about the nature of the mishap that had halted
Maddox&rsquo;s progress, but he learned little. He inferred,
however, that the royalties from the first well were dwindling at
an alarming rate and that any considerable delay in completing the
new well might therefore result in ruin to the owner. It was a
prospect that naturally gave Betty and her aunt grave concern.</p>

<p>When Ben had finished eating he said: &ldquo;Maybe I can give
this driller of yours some help. I&rsquo;ve worked on a good many
fishing jobs. D&rsquo;you think he&rsquo;d let me try?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He will if I tell him to,&rdquo; the girl declared.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s tried everything anybody has told him to try. Who
knows? Maybe you can do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The speaker put on her sunbonnet and together she and Furlong
went across the valley to the well.</p>

<p>Tiller Maddox was a swarthy man of about thirty-five; his eyes
were bold and black and set close together. He greeted the Durham
girl with an easy familiarity, a suggestion of proprietorship that
gave the visitor cause for thought, but towards Furlong he was none
too cordial and when Betty explained the reason for the
latter&rsquo;s presence Maddox frowned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Another wise guy, eh? Every rope-choker in ten miles has
been tryin&rsquo; to show us how smart he is. What d&rsquo;you know
about fishin&rsquo;, stranger?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; Ben confessed, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve had
some luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ve had plenty of luck, myself!&rdquo; Maddox
asserted. &ldquo;But I never had any good luck lettin&rsquo;
strangers monkey with my work. If you jim up the well, I take the
blame.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t jim anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll you charge for this here miracle of
yours?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Impatiently Miss Durham exclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
difference how much he charges if he can do&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been paid for any help I can give you,&rdquo;
Furlong declared. &ldquo;Probably I can&rsquo;t do anything, but so
far I don&rsquo;t even know what&rsquo;s wrong. Do you mind telling
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a bolt in the hole.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bolt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! A six-inch steel bolt. It worked loose and dropped
out of a tool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new one,&rdquo; Ben admitted. &ldquo;Why
don&rsquo;t you drill it out, pound it to pieces?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maddox grinned. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we been tryin&rsquo; to
do, but it&rsquo;s tempered harder than the bit. It dulls every
tool we use and all we been doin&rsquo; for for two weeks is
sharpen steel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you drill past it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How you goin&rsquo; to sidetrack a six-inch bolt loose in
the bottom of a hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can drive it into the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you can, can you? We&rsquo;re into a stratter of iron
pyrites an&rsquo; the rock&rsquo;s dam&rsquo; near as hard as the
bolt. It&rsquo;s much as ever a tool will cut it at all. That bolt
just shifts around in the bottom of the hole like it was in a steel
cup, an&rsquo; it&rsquo;s too small to grapple. I s&rsquo;pose we
could get holt of it with some fancy kind of a magnet if we could
get holt of some fancy kind of a magnet that would get holt of
it.&rdquo; Again Maddox grinned.</p>

<p>Betty Durham was staring as Furlong with an apprehensive pucker
between her brows. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that our luck, for a little
bitty old bolt to ruin everything? Can you think of any
way&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can think of one way that won&rsquo;t cost much to
try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any strangers experimentin&rsquo;
around&mdash;&rdquo; Maddox began; but the girl exclaimed,
sharply,</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been experimenting for two weeks at a
hundred dollars a day, haven&rsquo;t you? It&rsquo;s our well. Let
Mr. Furlong have a go at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The driller executed an exaggerated gesture of acquiescence.
&ldquo;Right you are, Betty! But if this feller puts it on the bum,
don&rsquo;t blame me.&rdquo; Then to Ben he announced: &ldquo;Help
yourself, pardner. You heard the boss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When Furlong had fully satisfied himself as to conditions he
took off his coat and went to work. He knew of no fishing tool so
designed as to pick up an object as small and as easily movable as
a six-inch bolt, therefore he made one. He took a short length of
steel casing of a diameter small enough to slip into the well, and
in one end of this he cut teeth several inches long. It was a labor
that consumed time: he was still at it when Betty reappeared at the
well about dark and advised him that his supper was waiting.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durham had returned from town. She was a woman of
indeterminate age. Her eyes were pale; her nose was hooked like the
beak of a hawk; her lips were thin and set in avaricious lines.
Immediately upon meeting Furlong she wanted to know whether he
believed his experiment would succeed, how he proposed to go about
it, how long it would take, and the like. Ben was noncommittal and
he refused to raise her hopes. Before he had finished his meal he
had convinced himself that the woman stood in some sort of dread of
Tiller Maddox and that her fear of antagonizing him almost equaled
her anxiety for Furlong&rsquo;s success. Ben wondered why. Another
fact he discovered&mdash;Betty and her aunt were not on the best
of terms.</p>

<p>After supper, by the light of a gasoline torch, Furlong resumed
his work the while Maddox vainly tried, with the new device which
his employer had brought out from town, to grapple that obstinate
piece of steel a fifth of a mile beneath his feet. But it was blind
work, monotonous work, dispiriting work; time after time the clumsy
fishing tool was raised and lowered, but its jaws refused to seize
the troublesome bolt. It was a job as hopeless and as baffling as
trying to pick up a pin with a pair of fire tongs attached to a
string.</p>

<p>The engineer of the rig watched Furlong&rsquo;s work with the
interest of a fellow machinist, and of him the latter inquired
finally:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! How come Mr. Durham to get killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was blowed up. It was when the Planet Company was
getting ready to put down that well on the northeast corner. Maddox
was workin&rsquo; for the company then&mdash;movin&rsquo; the rig
onto the ground. A powder wagon came by an&rsquo; the driver
stopped to ask his way. You&rsquo;ve seem them trucks&mdash;six
hundred odd quarts of nitroglycerine in square cans all set in
felt-lined racks to keep &rsquo;em from jarring. I allus been
scared of &rsquo;em, but them drivers pound their wagons over these
rough roads like it&rsquo;s so much molasses they got. Old man
Durham went across to the road and give him directions&mdash;he
stood there watchin&rsquo; the wagon as it drove on. The driver was
trottin&rsquo; his hosses, an&rsquo; when he crossed the railroad
track it let go. Jar set it off, I s&rsquo;pose. Tiller says he saw
it all, but he don&rsquo;t remember hearin&rsquo; a sound or
feelin&rsquo; a shock of any sort. All he seen was a big black
cloud, an&rsquo; when he looked for Old man Durham he wasn&rsquo;t
there. The fence was gone, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What happened to the driver?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you reckon happened? All the trace they ever
found of him or the outfit was part of a hoss&rsquo;s leg
hangin&rsquo; on a telegraph cross-arm about a hundred yards up the
grade. There was a hole thirty foot wide where the wagon had been
and the railroad iron was corkscrewed for a quarter of a mile. They
found quite a bit of Mr. Durham&mdash;enough to hold a funeral
over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Maddox wasn&rsquo;t scratched! That stuff certainly
acts queer at times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They figgered some air current was responsible. Kind of a
Godsend for Tiller, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to be killed? Sure&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw! To get in with the widder an&rsquo; Betty. Lucky for
them, too, that he took to lookin&rsquo; out for &rsquo;em. If he
makes this well they&rsquo;ll be movin&rsquo; into one of them
Dallas mansions with marble bedsteads.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! He&rsquo;ll never make a well if he keeps dropping
hardware in it. In my country a driller that careless would lose
his job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller won&rsquo;t lose his job,&rdquo; the engineer
asserted, positively. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t lose anything he goes
after.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the course of time Furlong finished cutting the end of his
steel casing into a series of teeth, and these teeth he then bent
slightly inward. This done, he attached the device to a tool and
lowered it into the hole. Even Betty Durham and her aunt Mary, who
looked on with growing suspense, understood now how he proposed to
pick up that bolt. He had shaped those tapering teeth so that they
resembled the curving fingers of a hand, and his delicate task was
to drive the casing home against the steel-hard bottom of the well
until those fingers closed, until he clinched them over the
obstacle. It was a task less difficult than it sounds.</p>

<p>Furlong himself handled the rig during this operation, and even
Maddox could find no fault with the way he did it. When, after what
seemed an interminable time, the wire cable began to stream up out
of the depths and wind itself in smooth, black layers upon the
drum, the two women pressed in upon the derrick floor.</p>

<p>Out of the well-mouth finally slid the fishing tool; it stopped,
hung motionless with the lower end at the level of their eyes. The
teeth had been bent inward, jammed together by the blows from
above; inside the basket thus formed and tightly bitten between two
of those prongs was a battered six-inch piece of steel.</p>

<p>When Furlong had finished washing up he found Betty Durham
waiting for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come over to the house,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You must
be tired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I was lucky,&rdquo; the young man declared,
with a grin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky, nothing. You&rsquo;ve got sense.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simple, wasn&rsquo;t it? I wonder Maddox never thought of
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty stirred; impatiently she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s
too busy thinking about something&mdash;! Say! We&rsquo;ve got an
extra room, but Aunt Mary says it wouldn&rsquo;t look right for you
to sleep there. Don&rsquo;t that make you sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How about the barn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what she proposed. Come on. We&rsquo;ll fix
it somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was dark; the trail through the cactus and the mesquite was
dim, but Betty knew it by heart, and where its meanderings were
indistinguishable she took Furlong&rsquo;s hand and guided him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you think Aunt Mary&rsquo;s crazy, risking all
her money like this,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure do.&rdquo; the man admitted. &ldquo;This thing
will show you the chances she&rsquo;s taking. Suppose that bolt had
been something else, something we couldn&rsquo;t get hold of?
There&rsquo;s a thousand things can happen to a well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know. But she&rsquo;s&mdash;greedy. She always was.
Tiller talked her into it after Uncle Joe died, and she
wouldn&rsquo;t listen to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lot safer to let the big companies do the
drilling, and be satisfied with a royalty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some people can&rsquo;t be satisfied,&rdquo; the girl
said, quietly. Then after a moment: &ldquo;Uncle Joe never intended
to leave the whole farm to her. They didn&rsquo;t hitch very well.
He said he was going to leave part of it to me, but&mdash;I guess
he never got around to do it. I&rsquo;ll bet Aunt Mary&rsquo;s
sorry by this time that she listened to Tiller; there&rsquo;s so
many things a driller can do to a well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! Is he that kind of a man?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What kind of a man? Men are all alike, aren&rsquo;t
they&mdash;when they&rsquo;ve got reason to be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She better fire him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess she can&rsquo;t, or dassent. . . . Funny my
talking this way to you and not knowing you only a few hours.
I&rsquo;d better mind my own business. Here we are. You wait while
I get a light.&rdquo; They had arrived at the house, and the girl
left her companion outside. She reappeared in a few minutes with a
lantern and a couple of patchwork comforters. These latter she
surrendered to Ben, then led the way to the barn.</p>

<p>Like most farms in the oil country, this one had been allowed to
run down, and with the exception of some chickens and a few
dispirited cattle there was no live stock left upon it. There still
remained, however, some old fodder; it was dusty and musty, but
suitable enough for a bed, and Furlong announced that he was
delighted with these sleeping arrangements. He set the lantern down
and walked to the door with Betty. There he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been mighty nice to me. I wish that fishing
job had been harder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would have taken longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl&rsquo;s face was dimly illuminated as she smiled up at
Furlong. She was the prettiest girl. he had ever known and he felt
a great liking, a great sympathy for her. The clasp of her warm
hand as she had guided him along the dark trail had affected him in
an unaccountable manner, and now it affected him again in the same
way when she laid it in his. A sudden recklessness overwhelmed him
and before he knew what he was doing he had bent forward and kissed
her.</p>

<p>The girl was startled, but she did not recoil. Curiously she
inquired; &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t help it, I
guess. I didn&rsquo;t intend to, but&mdash;&rdquo; Ben floundered;
he felt his face burning hotly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller tried that and I slapped him. I&rsquo;ve known him
a long time too,&mdash;!&rdquo; Miss Durham shook her head,
apparently more perplexed at her own lack of resentment than
surprised at Furlong&rsquo;s boldness. &ldquo;I must like you
pretty well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would&mdash;did. I&mdash;think you&rsquo;re
wonderful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer!&rdquo; Betty turned to go. A moment later she
called back through the gloom, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you when
breakfast is ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong was not altogether surprised when, on the following
morning, Tiller Maddox offered him a job. Maddox, it was plain, was
acting upon orders, and he took no pains to conceal his dislike for
the new hand; nevertheless, Ben accepted the proffer. Aside from
the fact that he needed work, his interest in Betty Durham was now
sufficient to make almost any sacrifice worth while.</p>

<p>In the days thereafter he tried to fathom the peculiar
relationship existing between Maddox and the two women, but he did
not succeed very well. The driller, it was evident, had his heart
set upon Betty, and in his attempt to win her Mrs. Durham was his
ally: nevertheless, for some unknown reason the aunt disliked and
distrusted the man. About all that Ben could make sure of was the
fact that in some manner not readily apparent the oil well was
being used by Maddox as a weapon; that somehow it had become the
stake in a three-cornered game.</p>

<p>Furlong and Betty meanwhile managed to see a good deal of each
other, but they met clandestinely. Neither of them openly referred
to this fact, and, although the girl pretended that it was her aunt
whom she feared, Ben very well knew that it was Maddox. No longer,
by the way, did he apologize when he kissed her, and their stolen
moments together had become very sweet.</p>

<p>Work on the well progressed as rapidly as could be expected.
Inch by inch, foot by foot, the heavy steel bits cut through the
rock; length after length was added to the casing, and as it neared
the level of the oil-bearing structure &ldquo;indications&rdquo;
became evident; occasional sighs and gurgles issued from the well
mouth as gas gathered and released itself. Its odor was at times
quite strong.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Maddox and Furlong clashed.</p>

<p>Some new tackle was being slung and Ben had been sent up aloft
while the foreman issued directions from below. It was heavy work.
Ben was forced to cling to the derrick timbers or to balance
himself upon a narrow plank, and his progress at times did not suit
the elder man. Maddox was in a surly mood, anyhow, and he became
profane. Furlong was hot and irritable. He answered back, whereupon
the man below flared out angrily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do like I tell you an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t argue, or
I&rsquo;ll come up there an&rsquo; give you a dam&rsquo; good
beating!&rdquo; The rigging was finally secured in place and Maddox
was occupying himself with something else when he felt a hand upon
his shoulder. He turned to find Furlong at his side. The
latter&rsquo;s eyes were blazing. In a voice ominously harsh and
vibrant with fury he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came down to get that beating. I want it
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other members of the crew froze in various attitudes of
startled suspense. The two men stared at each other.</p>

<p>Furlong was a burly, thick-necked youth: he was as hard as iron
and in his gaze at this moment was an evil quality quite
unexpected. His enmity for the driller had finally foamed over. In
proximity to this flaming passion Maddox&rsquo;s smoldering dislike
gave off no heat; nor at short notice could he fan its embers into
a blaze. After a brief survey, pregnant with possibilities, he
turned his head and winked at the other men. In a feeble effort at
jocularity he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d come up there and give it to you. I
never ast you to come down here an&rsquo; get it.&rdquo; He
guffawed loudly at his own humor and walked away. Furlong stood
shaking in his tracks.</p>

<p>That evening Maddox went over to the farmhouse. Evenings in this
thirsty land, like evenings upon the desert, were cool, refreshing,
beautiful. The brazen sky cooled, a blessed breeze played through
the scrubby bush and brought faint fragrances unnoticed at other
hours; the harsh outlines of unlovely objects were softened; birds
twittered; Nature filled her lungs and took on new vigor.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durham was rocking upon the little front porch, and of her
the man inquired:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her and Ben have gone to town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maddox scowled. &ldquo;I allowed they had.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone in to buy himself some clothes and she
took the car&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t need no more clothes than he&rsquo;s got,
on this job,&rdquo; asserted the driller. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s all
through an&rsquo; washed up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened, Tiller?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We had a row. I was a fool to put him on, in the first
place, but his week&rsquo;s up Friday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Durham ceased rocking; her sallow face became more yellow.
With an effort she said: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a right smart hand,
Tiller. I&rsquo;d ruther you didn&rsquo;t fire him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hell you&rsquo;d ruther!&rdquo; Maddox exclaimed,
angrily. &ldquo;What you got to say about it?&rdquo; &ldquo;Why,
it&rsquo;s my prop&rsquo;ty, my well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Y&mdash;you know what I mean. He&rsquo;s smart, I tell
you. Didn&rsquo;t he fish that bolt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! An&rsquo; didn&rsquo;t you hire him straight off,
so&rsquo;s to spy on me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller! It&rsquo;s no such thing. Why should I spy on
you? What you been doin&rsquo; that you need
spyin&rsquo;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut up an&rsquo; listen to me. He&rsquo;s fired Friday
night an&rsquo; he gets off this place the next mornin&rsquo;. So
that&rsquo;s that! Saturday, sometime, the powder wagon&rsquo;ll be
here an&rsquo; early Monday the men are comin&rsquo; to shoot the
well. We got a big one; I&rsquo;ll bet my life on that. I can tell!
Why, she&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; gas an&rsquo; tryin&rsquo; her best
to let go, but&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker paused, then finished
slowly, distinctly&mdash;&ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t agoin&rsquo; to
be no well whatever until I&rsquo;m took care of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The widow&rsquo;s colorless eyes fixed themselves hypnotically
upon the swarthy face of the man before her. He continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t gettin&rsquo; along any too good with
Betty before this feller showed up, but since he came she
won&rsquo;t have nothin&rsquo; to do with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did the best I could,&rdquo; Mrs. Durham declared,
nervously, &ldquo;but she says she won&rsquo;t marry you. She goes
hog wild every time I talk about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s ways to make a girl marry. You got to make
her marry me before that well comes in, or it&rsquo;s just like I
said&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t cominin!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller!&rdquo; gasped the woman. &ldquo;You dassent do
&mdash;anything to it. Not now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dassent I? Who&rsquo;ll stop me? You won&rsquo;t.
That little old bolt made a lot of trouble, didn&rsquo;t it? Well,
that&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo;. It just shows how easy it is
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you do that?&rdquo; Mrs. Durham bleated, in
dismay.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t sayin&rsquo; I did or I didn&rsquo;t. But
remember, if this well ain&rsquo;t a producer, you&rsquo;re blowed
up, and it ain&rsquo;t a-goin&rsquo; to produce till there&rsquo;s
a Mrs. Tiller Maddox to see it and to get her share! We bargained
that all out, long ago. Yes, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t afraid of you
goin&rsquo; back on our deal, either. You don&rsquo;t
dast.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;ll try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You better do more&rsquo;n try. I&rsquo;ll give you just
one more chance. If she don&rsquo;t come across, I want you to go
visit your folks Saturday evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; leave her here.
Understand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Mrs. Durham stared at the speaker, then she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller Maddox, you&rsquo;re a dirty dog!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! I&rsquo;ve took all the back talk I can stand for
one day. You heard me. You do like I tell you, an&rsquo; you
needn&rsquo;t to get back from your visit till Monday.
That&rsquo;ll give her all Sunday to cry. She&rsquo;s sensible.
She&rsquo;ll come around when she&rsquo;s had time to think it over
an&rsquo; do a lot of cryin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Not until Ben and Betty had finished their shopping and were on
their way home did he tell her about the trouble he had had with
Maddox that morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He let on he was fooling, but of course he&rsquo;ll fire
me the first chance he gets,&rdquo; Furlong predicted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ben! Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were bound to tie into each other sooner or later. You
can&rsquo;t choose a time to get fighting mad; it&rsquo;s as much
as you can do to pick good footing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aunt Mary won&rsquo;t let him fire you. She doesn&rsquo;t
trust him any more than I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! What has he got on her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl did not look up from her driving. She fetched a deep
breath as she said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;d dearly love to know.
There&rsquo;s something queer about it. . . . Uncle Joe was a
sweet, easy-going man and she rode him with a Spanish bit. She
never would have let him take me in, when my folks died, only I did
all the work. But he sure loved me. When the oil excitement came
they rowed and fought for months. Whenever he got an offer she
claimed he was trying to give the farm away and threatened to go to
law. I told you about that. He stood it as long as he could; then
he up and announced that I&rsquo;d been more of a daughter to him
than she&rsquo;d been a wife and he aimed to give most of his money
to me anyhow, and then he made that lease with the Planet people.
That&rsquo;s how Maddox came. I think she&rsquo;d have poisoned me,
if she dared, after what uncle said. When he was killed I supposed,
of course, she&rsquo;d throw me out, but she didn&rsquo;t. No use
to do it, I suppose, inasmuch as he hadn&rsquo;t left any writing.
As a matter of fact, she was better to me than she&rsquo;d ever
been. That&rsquo;s what makes me wonder sometimes&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wonder what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he didn&rsquo;t tell Tiller something. Something that
makes her scared of him. Sometimes she acts like it&rsquo;s only
because of him that she&rsquo;s nice to me. . . . I don&rsquo;t
know what I&rsquo;d do if she sent me away. I haven&rsquo;t got a
red cent. There isn&rsquo;t a living soul I could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben passed his arm around the slim, girlish figure and drew it
to him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be about all for you!&rdquo; He kissed
the cheek next to his and Betty hungrily pressed her face closer.
&ldquo;Good thing you aren&rsquo;t an heiress&mdash;and me with
less than a hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You behave yourself, or you&rsquo;ll wreck this
car,&rdquo; the girl warned him.</p>

<p>Maddox carried out his intention. He discharged Furlong on
Friday night, explaining that the well was down, and the next
morning Ben broke the news to his sweetheart. Betty was indignant.
She was for appealing to her aunt, but he refused to permit her. He
now had money in his pocket. There were better jobs to be had, and
he intended to find one in the immediate neighborhood where he
could see her often. He promised to let her hear from him in a day
or so.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s face was flushed, her eyes were shining, when she
entered the house after he had gone. She was surprised to find her
aunt awaiting her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tiller came over the other night while you was in
town,&rdquo; Mrs. Durham began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He talked a lot about you. Tiller&rsquo;s a fine man,
dearie&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty broke out irritably: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s start
that all over again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, your head&rsquo;s full of this Furlong, I suppose!
But what&rsquo;s he got? Nothing. Not even a job. Now Tiller wants
to marry you and&mdash;you better do it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know very well I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the
sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you won&rsquo;t and maybe you will.&rdquo; Mrs.
Durham&rsquo;s lips set themselves in lines of inflexibility.
&ldquo;If you got a smitch of sense you will. D&rsquo;you want to
be poor all your life or d&rsquo;you want to be rich?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t! I won&rsquo;t!&rdquo; declared
the girl. &ldquo;The big, black, greasy brute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t fly off the handle till I&rsquo;m
through. I&rsquo;ve been pretty good to you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see that you have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I have,&rdquo; snapped the other.
&ldquo;T&rsquo;ain&rsquo;t every woman would take you in, give you
clothes, send you to school&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Joe did that. You didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I kept you after he died, didn&rsquo;t I? Any reason why
I couldn&rsquo;t of thrown you out? No.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve earned my keep ever since I came. You&rsquo;d
have paid more for a hired girl than I cost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush up and let me finish! We allus fight like this.
Your Uncle Joe cared a lot for you and&mdash;and I want to respect
his wishes. When that well comes in this farm&rsquo;ll be
worth&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what. Anyhow, my heart&rsquo;s set
on seeing you get a good home and have everything. How&rsquo;d you
like to live in a fine house in Dallas, or somewhere, and have a
big car and a piano and money in the bank and di&rsquo;mond rings
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ails you? Are you losing your mind, Aunt
Mary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have &rsquo;em if you marry Tiller. Marry Furlong
and you&rsquo;ll spend your life over a cook stove.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can Tiller give me things like that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give &rsquo;em to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a moment Betty inquired, curiously, &ldquo;How much will
you give?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Durham&rsquo;s turn to hesitate, her words came with
an effort. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;mebbe a quarter
interest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; The exclamation was one of scorn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s gratitude for you! Mebbe if it&rsquo;s a
real big well I&rsquo;d do better. You&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got to do
it, Betty!&rdquo; the widow cried in distraction. &ldquo;If you
don&rsquo;t he&rsquo;ll ruin everything. He said so. If that well
don&rsquo;t come in the farm ain&rsquo;t worth&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So! That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re so generous. Now you
listen to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t marry Tiller Maddox, not for all the
oil in Texas, not if it was to save your life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ll get out of my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll get out this minute.&rdquo; Betty
turned away, whereupon the elder woman exclaimed: &ldquo;Wait!
Don&rsquo;t make up your mind in a hurry. I&mdash;I&rsquo;m going
over to Cousin Anna&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When? What for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right after dinner. You think it over while I&rsquo;m
gone, dearie. I feel like you was my own kin. I want to do right by
you and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>Opportunity lay hot and gasping under the sun. There was no
shade out-of-doors, for nothing grew in the streets, not even
grass; its cinder yards, its board walls and iron roofs radiated
waves of heat like those from a stove. Even the breeze that swept
across the waterless countryside was blistering and it carried a
burden of choking dust.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon Ben Furlong entered the skating rink, paid
his admission at the turnstile, and went through. Here, at least,
was a place to sit down out of the sun. An amazingly discordant
mechanical piano was playing, and in time with it sweating men in
overalls were skating arm-in-arm with hard-faced girls in khaki
knickerbockers and soiled shirtwaists.</p>

<p>Out of the whirling throng upon the floor shot a figure; it was
Ben&rsquo;s friend, the engineer of the Maddox rig. He rolled up to
the bench where Furlong sat and collapsed upon it. He still wore
the grease and the grime of his calling, but his exertions had
blended them, run them together.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! It&rsquo;s hard work havin&rsquo; a good time in
this town,&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Landed a job yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got some prospects lined up. What&rsquo;s the
matter? You fired, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Naw! Maddox laid us off for the day. Miz&rsquo; Durham
brought us in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did Betty come with her?&rdquo; Ben eagerly inquired.</p>

<p>The engineer shook his head; a grin spread over his face.
&ldquo;Say! You know how scared Tiller is of nitroglycerine? When
we left he was hidin&rsquo; out in the brush like a quail. The
powder wagon came an&rsquo; he took it on the run.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Powder wagon? What&rsquo;s a powder wagon doing
there?&rdquo; Ben inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he aims to shoot the well. He got a permit an&rsquo;
the stuff&rsquo;s on the ground, ready for the men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s crazy if he shoots that well!&rdquo; Furlong
declared. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he thinking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I told him. &lsquo;Leave her alone an&rsquo;
she&rsquo;ll blow herself in,&rsquo; I says to him. She&rsquo;s
coughin&rsquo; now, an&rsquo; I bet as many wells has been ruined
by that stuff as they is wells that&rsquo;s been made. You know
that, Ben. But he tells me to mind my own business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see Mrs. Durham.&rdquo; Ben rose, but
the other explained:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s gone away over Sunday to visit her
kinfolks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s looking out for Betty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno. Tiller, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong frowned. For a while he listened inattentively to his
companion, then he rose and left the rink.</p>

<p>Conditions all over the oil fields, as he well knew, were
unsettled, and he did not relish the thought of Betty out there
alone in that farmhouse; but even more disturbing was the fact that
Maddox proposed to shoot the Durham well. What ailed the man? If
experience had taught Ben anything, it had taught him that an
oil-bearing structure such as existed in that locality rendered the
use of explosives highly hazardous. Only in case the oil stubbornly
refused to flow would its use be wise. But this well gave every
indication of blowing itself in, with a little help! Maddox was
indeed insane.</p>

<p>After some indecision Ben decided to warn Betty. It was none of
his business, to be sure, but a word from her might induce the aunt
to go slowly and perhaps save the cost of the well. It would be
criminal to leave her in ignorance of the risks she ran. He tried
to hire a car to run him back out to the farm, but what few were
for hire were out, and it was some time before he could discover a
truck that was later going in that direction.</p>

<p>It was considerably after dark when Furlong left Opportunity; he
had to walk the last three miles, so it was late bedtime when he
finally arrived at the Durham homestead.</p>

<p>Evidently Betty was asleep; at any rate, the farmhouse windows
were dark and Ben wondered how he could best awaken her without
causing alarm. Visitors in the country at this time of night were
not common. He decided to call softly from outside her window, so
he closed the gate quietly behind him and made his way around the
house.</p>

<p>He paused in surprise when he had turned the corner of the
building, for the kitchen door was open. A momentary panic swept
over him; then he drew a breath of relief, for at that moment he
heard the girl&rsquo;s muffled voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>He opened his lips to speak reassuringly, but the sound died in
his throat, for inside Betty&rsquo;s room he heard a man&rsquo;s
voice, then a stir, a movement. This was followed by a crash, as if
a chair had been overturned, then a scream.</p>

<p>Furlong uttered a shout; he leaped forward.</p>

<p>Some marauder had entered the house just ahead of him.
Incredible as it seemed, he had arrived barely in time&mdash;He
plunged in through the kitchen door and fetched up sprawling across
the table. There was a crash of crockery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Betty!&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;<em>Betty!</em>&rdquo; He
made for the door beyond.</p>

<p>That throaty clamor from the girl&rsquo;s room, meanwhile,
continued. There were hasty movements, the sounds of a
struggle.</p>

<p>Furlong had never been inside the front part of the house, but
its plan was simple and he was guided by those shrieks of terror.
The door to Betty&rsquo;s room was closed, but it opened when he
found the knob. He glimpsed the dim square of a window opposite and
silhouetted against it he saw the girl herself, then of a sudden he
felt the floor fall away beneath his feet and realized that he had
been projected headlong into a bottomless abyss.</p>

<p>The next he knew Betty Durham was holding his head in her lap
and splashing water into his face. It struck him as queer that the
lamp should be burning when only the fraction of an instant before
all had been darkness.</p>

<p>Mechanically he made an effort to rise, but could not manage
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Must have hit on my head,&rdquo; he mumbled thickly, and
raised groping fingers. Then he sat up. He knew now that he had not
fallen into a pit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are they? What&rsquo;s&mdash;happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty was sobbing wildly; her hair hung in a cascade about her
shoulders; she was clad only in her nightdress, and it was soaked
with the water she had poured over Ben to revive him.</p>

<p>Beside the open door to the hall lay the wreck of a chair; two
of its legs were splintered, broken off: Ben realized more clearly
now what it was that had crashed down upon his head. With an effort
he scrambled dizzily to his feet. Water was trickling into his eyes
and blinding him; he brushed it away, then discovered, to his great
surprise, that it was not water at all, but blood, his own blood.
His head felt numb and twice its normal size; his brain did not
function clearly and his limbs refused to obey him.</p>

<p>Betty&rsquo;s voice came to him as if from a long distance; she
was telling him something, trying to make him understand that they
were alone in the house and that their assailant had fled. When
this became plain to Furlong, he sat down.</p>

<p>It was some time before the girl succeeded in stanching that
flow of blood from Ben&rsquo;s scalp and in binding up the wound,
for she was scarcely in condition to render help to anybody. By the
time her task was completed Ben had managed to get a pretty clear
idea of what had happened. She had been awakened by a sound and had
realized that somebody was in her room; she had uttered a
frightened challenge, only to feel groping hands upon her, to find
herself in the grasp of some unseen person. She retained no very
clear recollection of anything after that; the rest was a hideous
nightmare. Not until the miscreant had bolted out of the house and
she had finally managed somehow to strike a light was she made
aware of the reason for his flight. Then she had stumbled over Ben
and had realized that it was his voice she had heard calling to
her, that it was the sound of his coming that had interrupted the
attack. His plight had done a good deal to bring her back to
herself, but now she threatened to again abandon her
self-control.</p>

<p>Furlong checked this by saying: &ldquo;Betty Durham!
You&rsquo;ve got nothing on but your nightie!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was some time later when the girl emerged from her room,
dressed after a fashion, to find her deliverer waiting in the
kitchen with a scowl upon his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got a gun?&rdquo; he inquired, harshly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Ben. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to kill Maddox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Betty stared at the speaker; with shaking fingers
she plucked at her dress. It was in a thin, reedy voice that she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t Maddox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know! It wasn&rsquo;t Maddox.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; The girl nodded, and Ben bowed his
throbbing head in his hands. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad,&rdquo; he
groaned. &ldquo;Providence certainly brought me back. It
wouldn&rsquo;t happen that way once in a thousand times. Whoever it
was, I&rsquo;ll find him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both the man and the girl were in wretched condition. The rest
of the night they sat together, watching the clock and listening
for a possible return of the marauder, waiting for the day to
break. It was a considerable relief to hear the members of the
drilling crew when they passed about two o&rsquo;clock. Thereafter
they felt more secure.</p>

<p>It was shortly after they had finished breakfast that Furlong
was surprised to discover signs of activity, movements, goings-on
at the well which caused him to stare fixedly, then to announce,
incredulously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say! I believe Maddox is fixing to shoot the
well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty took her place at his side. &ldquo;Why&mdash;he
can&rsquo;t! He dassent! The powder men won&rsquo;t be here till
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All the same, he&rsquo;s doing something queer. See those
cans&mdash;those shiny things?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t hire Tiller to touch nitroglycerine.
He&rsquo;s scared of it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ben uttered an oath. &ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s filling those
cartridges. He&rsquo;s crazy! You&rsquo;ve got to stop
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty turned white; she shook her head. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t go
near the place. It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s Aunt Mary&rsquo;s
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stop him. Why, it&rsquo;s ten to one
he&rsquo;ll sear the rock, ruin the whole job and&mdash;Damned if
I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s trying to do that very
thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong started for the door, but Betty clung to him. When he
pushed on past her she followed him. Together they hurried across
the field and took the path through the mesquite. As they went the
girl continued to implore him not to interfere.</p>

<p>Halfway to the drilling camp they met the engineer hastening
towards the farmhouse, and the latter announced, breathlessly:
&ldquo;Tiller&rsquo;s gone plumb off his nut! He&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to shoot the well himself. You better stay
clear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong dashed past the speaker and emerged from the shelter of
the bushes in time to see Maddox gingerly swing a long, cylindrical
tin over the well mouth and guide it into the opening. A new manila
rope had been run through a block on the derrick, and with this he
lowered the charge.</p>

<p>Ben yelled at him; he waved his arms. Maddox glanced over his
shoulder, then let the line slide smoothly through his hands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take my tip an&rsquo; don&rsquo;t go too close,&rdquo;
the engineer shouted. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t no powder man an&rsquo;
that well&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; gas. She blows off every few
minutes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Betty seconded this warning in frantic tones of appeal:
&ldquo;Let him go, Ben. He knows what he&rsquo;s doing.
You&rsquo;ve got no right stopping him. You&rsquo;ll just make
trouble&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of my business,&rdquo; the latter agreed,
impatiently, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s something
crooked&mdash;&rdquo; He ceased speaking; then he seized Betty and
whirled her around with the sharp command, &ldquo;Run! Get
back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were still perhaps a hundred yards from the well, but
Furlong&rsquo;s practiced eye had seen something that suddenly
raised the hair upon his head. That rope from which was suspended
the heavy charge of liquid death no longer hung vertically, it no
longer ran over the block and into the casing; instead it was
falling in loops about Maddox. It was coming up out of the
well!</p>

<p>Maddox himself was alive to what had happened. That which he
most greatly feared had come upon him, and he also turned to flee.
But the platform was slippery or else he tripped over the rope and
fell. The others heard his cry of terror. He quickly regained his
feet, but to Furlong it seemed as if his movements thereafter were
maddeningly slow and deliberate, as if the whole scene before him
was being photographed upon his brain by a slow-motion
moving-picture camera.</p>

<p>The engineer&rsquo;s apprehensions had been well grounded. Once
again gas had been released far down in the earth, and now, like
breath forced from the lungs of some tortured giant, it rose,
propelling the smoothly fitting cartridge of nitroglycerine ahead
of it as a pea is propelled out of a pea-shooter. It was a
phenomenon by no means unusual in a well as unstable in its balance
of forces as this one. In fact, under like conditions none but a
madman would have dared to risk Maddox&rsquo;s maneuver.</p>

<p>The latter had not put fifty feet behind him when up out of the
well mouth shot the gleaming tin cylinder. Directly above and in
its path hung the massive forty-foot steel bit suspended from its
wire cable.</p>

<p>What happened next the observers were never able to agree upon,
but the world dissolved into an inferno of smoke and flame and the
suddenness of it rocked the sky, upheaved the earth. The two came
together with a cataclysmic roar. Furlong and Betty Durham were
tossed headlong, flung down like straws. When they scrambled to
their feet, dazed, shaken, terrified, it was to find themselves
enveloped in a mighty dust cloud. The eighty-foot tower of heavy
timbers was gone; in an instant it had utterly vanished. Where it
had stood was a shallow, smoking crater. Splinters of planking,
debris of every sort, were scattered far and wide; particles of
earth and gravel were raining from the heavens with the sound of a
heavy hailstorm; nothing in the neighborhood of the well remained
except the boiler and engine, and the former lay upon its side.
Even the bushes had been whipped out, uprooted, shaved off as by a
sweeping scythe.</p>

<p>That afternoon Furlong&rsquo;s friend, the engineer, came over
to the farmhouse with a considerable bundle in his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Betty?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right, but pretty well bruised, of
course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess there&rsquo;s nothin&rsquo; more us boys
can do, so we&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; in to town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right. I&rsquo;ll stay here until Mrs. Durham gets
back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s all of Tiller&rsquo;s stuff that we could
find. I reckon you better look after it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything besides clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much. A few letters an&rsquo; things we found in his
bunk. Miz&rsquo; Durham can keep &rsquo;em in case he&rsquo;s got
relatives. There&rsquo;s one suit of clothes that would fit me. No
use to throw &rsquo;em away. Say! It&rsquo;s funny how scared he
was of powder. It musta been a hunch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Shortly after the engineer had left, Ben came to Betty with a
queer light in his eyes. In his hand he held a soiled sheet of
foolscap paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Feel strong enough to stand another explosion?&rdquo; he
inquired with an effort to suppress his agitation. &ldquo;Well, the
queerest thing&mdash;! This farm doesn&rsquo;t belong to your aunt
Mary, after all; it belongs to <em>you!&rdquo;</em> The girl
gasped; she voiced some breathless query, but Ben ran on:
&ldquo;Your uncle Joe left it to you, just as he promised. He left
everything to you, except a thousand dollars to her. This is his
will and Maddox had it. I guess it&rsquo;s a good will, even though
your uncle wrote it himself. Anyhow it&rsquo;s witnessed by two
people&mdash;Maddox and another. From the date I figure it must
have been signed just a day or so before he was killed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from? How did Maddox&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve figured that out, too. Mr. Durham must have
had it in his pocket when Maddox found him. That would explain
everything&mdash;how he made your aunt do just what he wanted and
why she didn&rsquo;t dare to fire him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why she said I&rsquo;d have to marry him!
That&rsquo;s why&mdash;Oh, Ben!&rdquo; Betty rose suddenly and
clutched Furlong. &ldquo;I knew she was a mean, selfish old thing,
but I never thought she was so&mdash;wicked. This oil is a curse
to poor people. I hate it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Betty!&rdquo; Furlong exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
the wicked one to quarrel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s the only kin I&rsquo;ve got left and I tried
my best to love her. But she was so greedy for quick money that
nothing mattered. Maddox, too! It made beasts of them. I almost
wish we&rsquo;d never heard of oil.&rdquo; After a moment the
speaker continued, more quietly: &ldquo;I lied to you last night.
It was Tiller who came here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Furlong&rsquo;s body stiffened, he breathed an oath, then he
muttered: &ldquo;I thought so. Why didn&rsquo;t you tell
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s more, she knew he was&mdash;coming! They
arranged it. She as good as sent him! That&rsquo;s how he got the
kitchen key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This announcement the man greeted with the growl of an animal.
He began to pace about the room; his face had grown black and
threatening; his fingers were working as he stormed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait! Wait till she gets back here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t lay your hands on a
woman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; he breathed.</p>

<p>Betty shook her head; a moment, then a new expression slowly
crept into her eyes; her chin set itself firmly. &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
she declared. &ldquo;But you can lay &rsquo;em on her trunk and
drag it out here where I can pack it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I sure can,&rdquo; Ben agreed. &ldquo;And what&rsquo;s
more, when you get it packed I can lug it out to the gate where it
will be nice and handy for her.&rdquo; As he finished speaking his
frown disappeared; it was replaced by a grin and he said:
&ldquo;Say, Betty! What d&rsquo;you think? I&rsquo;m going to marry
an heiress, after all.&rdquo;</p>
