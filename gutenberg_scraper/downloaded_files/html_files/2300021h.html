<h2>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h2>

<p class="first">British-born and educated at Berlin and Oxford,
Ernest Favenc (1845-1908; the name is of Huguenot origin) arrived
in Australia aged 19, and while working on cattle and sheep
stations in Queensland wrote occasional stories for the
<i>Queenslander</i>. In 1877 the newspaper sponsored an
expedition to discover a viable railway route from Adelaide to
Darwin, which was led by Favenc. He later undertook further
explorations, and then moved to Sydney.</p>

<p>He wrote some novels and poems and a great many short stories,
reputedly 300 or so. Three volumes of his stories were published
in his lifetime:</p>

<p><i>The Last of Six, Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1893</p>

<p><i>Tales of the Austral Tropics</i>, 1894</p>

<p><i>My Only Murder and Other Tales</i>, 1899</p>
<br>

<p>His short stories range from bush humor to horror,
supernatural to strange, and to the privations of late 19th
century exploration in Australia's unforgiving inland. His first
two short story books (consolidated into one volume, as there is
considerable overlap), are available free as an ebook from
Project Gutenberg Australia.</p>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>1. &mdash; A TALE OF THE WESTERN DESERT</h2>

<h3><i>Bendigo Advertiser</i>, Victoria, Australia, 10 Feb
1894</h3>

<p class="first">A PARTY of four of us&mdash;three whites and a
black boy&mdash;while out on a prospecting trip in Western
Australia, were induced by likely auriferous indications to push
into the interior, far beyond the head of the Gascoyne. We were
well equipped, and were especially lucky in the season; so we
agreed, although the gold indications had failed, to go on and,
if possible, work our way right through the unknown country to
Kimberley. We were all experienced bushmen, and, as our horses
were in good condition, there was nothing very hazardous in the
attempt.</p>

<p>On Sunday, November 22nd, 1891, we were camped at a native
well of fairly fresh water, where there was a patch of good feed
for the horses, and about a mile away a small salt lake, on which
were swans, geese, and other wildfowl. We determined to spell for
a week in order to recruit, and, at the same time, do so without
encroaching on our rations, as the game in the lake would support
us.</p>

<p>With the exception of the flat on which was the good grass I
mentioned, the country was desolate and barren in the extreme,
sandy, and covered with spinifex. From a low sandhill not far
from our camp a range was just visible to the northwest. It was
to this point we determined to steer when we again started How
far away it was, we could not determine, but it was a
considerable distance, as we could only see it before sunrise and
after sunset during the short clear twilight. Dan, the black boy,
who came from the coast and did not understand the phenomena of
the plains, used to declare that it was no range, but a cloud;
and in spite of all our laughter about a cloud remaining always
in one place, and always of the same shape, he stuck to his
opinion.</p>

<p>At the end of the week we started. From various indications we
imagined that we should find it dry ahead, and took what
precautions we could. We left as soon as our horses had had their
morning drink, and all day rode through an unvarying tract of
spinifex plains and low sandhills.</p>

<p>By a great stroke of good luck, we came towards evening to a
grassed flat between two sand ridges, where a passing
thunderstorm had left a little water in a clay pan. This was just
enough for our wants; but, strange to say, even from the top of
the sand ridges we could no longer sight the range, although so
much nearer to it. This could easily be accounted for by the
formation of the country; but Dan, of course, put it down to his
cloud theory. From the time we left the salt lake we had not seen
a living thing of any sort, not even a lizard.</p>

<p>Next morning we started in the same direction, but still the
country remained unchanged. Shortly after mid-day we ascended a
sand ridge somewhat higher than usual, and simultaneously all
pulled up at the sight in front of us. About two miles ahead was
the range we had been steering for, hitherto shut out by the high
ridge we were standing on.</p>

<p>A grim, bare, rocky range, with level but somewhat serrated
summit running north and south: between us and it was a sand
plain, without a vestige of vegetation on it stretching right to
the rock at the foot of the range. The whole, under the fierce
vertical sun, was so blinding and radiating, that involuntarily
we put up our hands, as though shading our faces from the open
door of a furnace.</p>

<p>"We'll tackle that later on," said Westall, one of my
companions.</p>

<p>We agreed, and retraced our steps to where there were some
miserable stunted gums affording a little shade Here we turned
out and boiled the billy Whilst we had our meal, after relieving
the horses of the packs and water-bags, we discussed our
movements, and agreed to ride over to the range and examine it,
leaving Dan to mind the other horses.</p>

<p>It appeared, certainly, as though we would have to push back
to the salt lake during the night. In the afternoon we rode to
the range across the belt of bare, blistering sand. It was
granite, and beyond its barrier-like formation and surroundings
there was nothing uncommon in it.</p>

<p>I turned to ride slowly one way, and Westall and James went
the other. In about half an hour I returned to the point where
our tracks struck the range, but could see nothing of my
companions. I waited some time, and then rode slowly on their
tracks. Soon I met James coming back.</p>

<p>"Where is Westall?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he turned back," he replied; "there's nothing to do,
unless go up the range on foot; but Westall said he would go on a
little further."</p>

<p>We waited, and as we did there came to our ears an awful cry
of agony for help, that simultaneously we both shouted in reply,
and pushed forward as fast as the sand would permit. It must have
been a terrible cry to have reached us, for seemed to traverse
nearly a mile before we came upon Westall&mdash;up to his waist
in sand, and his horse, from which he had thrown himself over the
saddle, in the same. Which bore the most agonised expression, man
or horse, it was impossible to say.</p>

<p>The horse was incapable of movement; but Westall could till
move his arms. They were in a dry quicksand, and the sand was
burning hot. James seemed paralysed; but I, who heard of such
things, jumped off, calling him to do the same, and commenced
frantically to unbuckle my reins and slip my stirrup-leathers, in
response to the despairing yells for help that came to us.</p>

<p>While still engaged in this task, the horse, with a scream of
pain, disappeared. As fast as we could, we worked; then,
approaching as closely as we dared, we threw the substitute for a
rope to the wretched man, now nearly up to the I armpits.</p>

<p>It was too short. We threw ourselves flat, and felt the uneasy
mass of burning sand immediately in front, and thought we could
trust it. James got on his knees and tried another cast. This
time u was successful. Westall caught the stirrup-iron at the
end, and I, too, rose to seize the leather, when, as if
determined not to lose its prey, the sand began to heave and
work, consequent on the submergence of the horse, and Westall,
who must have been mercifully dead with the sudden increased
pressure, disappeared.</p>

<p>"Save yourself!" shrieked James; "it's got us."</p>

<p>If by magic, the sand beneath became tremulous and yielding. I
was nearest the range, and throwing myself flat once more,
commenced to roll toward it. James instinctively started to his
feet to run, and was caught, as were the horses.</p>

<p>I reached the range, clutched the burning rock, and dragged
myself on it. When I dared look, I wonder I did not go mad. James
was digging his hands in the hot sand, striving to drag himself
out; and the horses!&mdash;one stood quiet, trembling only, while
the sweat rained down; the other strove and struggled, and
whinnied piteously. And I had to sit there and watch it all,
utterly helpless. The only thing I could do was to throw myself
in and perish with them. But such a death! I turned face down,
and covered my eyes, and tried to stop my ears.</p>

<p>Once I looked. The devilish sand seemed alive with fury or
joy, shaking and quaking, and boiling almost. James must have
been dead, for he was lying forward with his head on his arms.
One of the horses was the same, the other was quiet; and I turned
away.</p>

<p>When I looked again, everything had disappeared, only the
glowing sand was still full of motion. I was alone.</p>

<p>When at last I regained some mastery over myself, the sun was
sinking low. The treacherous, horrible sand was quiescent; but
determined to wait until far into the night before seeking a
passage; meanwhile, I commenced to make along the rocks to the
spot where we struck the range, as being the safest place to
attempt it. But I reflected&mdash;the hellish thing having been
once set in motion, it may be days before it settles down again;
meanwhile, Dan will either come to look for us, and perish too,
or return to the old camp at the salt lake, and leave me to
perish by a more lingering death than that my companions met
with.</p>

<p>As this comforting thought struck me, I came upon what seemed
a confirmation of my fears. Three skeletons lay on the rocks, and
further off I saw the remains of two more natives who had been
entrapped like I had. Perhaps a whole tribe had gone under.
Surely if they could find no means of escape, what chance had
I?</p>

<p>It was more than once I approached the edge of the rocks,
meaning to dare the fatal passage; but my courage failed me. The
range, as I said, was bare, smooth rock, and I had weighty object
with which to test the condition of the sand. At last I thought
of the dead bodies, and although the task was sufficiently
repulsive, I managed to accomplish it, and dragged them to the
edge of the range, and pushed them out on to the quicksand. They
lay there unengulfed. Apparently, the way was open.</p>

<p>Still, I was too frightened to trust myself on my feet, and
rolled the whole way across to the firm ground. When I got up and
looked back, the two bodies had disappeared. I waited for no
more, but hurried back to camp.</p>

<p>I explained what had happened to the boy, and he at once
became terribly alarmed, and showed the greatest anxiety to leave
such a dangerous neighbourhood. We reached the settled country
after some days&mdash;that is to say, I reached it, for Dan
disappeared before then. It will easily be understood that his
disappearance was necessary, as if left to tell some garbled tale
he might have been the cause of suspicion that I had murdered my
mates; our experience having been too startling for ordinary
belief.</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>2. &mdash; THE SWAGMAN'S DREAM</h2>

<h3><i>Yass Evening Tribune</i>, NSW, Australia, 3 Jan 1901</h3>

<p class="first"><i>For non-Australians, the "jackasses" in the
last paragraph are kookaburras, birds popularly nicknamed
"laughing jackasses" at the time.</i></p>
<br>

<p class="first">TWO men&mdash;two swagmen&mdash;met on an
outback road, about an hour or two before sundown, and they
squatted down for a smoke, and exchanged confidences.</p>

<p>"You'll strike Hungry Hartford's place about sundown, and I
don't envy you. You'll get tucker, such as it is. A pint of
weevily flour; it it's beef, you'll get the New England tongue,
or it it's mutton, you'll get a scraggy piece of the neck and
shoulder. As for the tea, it's all stalks, and as for the sugar
it's black with age, and no sweetness in it."</p>

<p>"There should be a law," said No. 2, "compelling squatters to
furnish decent rations. How can they expect a man to travel on
such cag-mag?"</p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," said No 1. "They talk about their
Early Closing Acts and their Sunday closing, and their this,
that, and the other, but how about our rights and privileges?
Blow me, if they're regarded in the least. We should have a
swagman's member in Parliament."</p>

<p>"We should," said No. 2, "and if I could make a rise I'd go in
on that ticket; I can talk as well as most of them."</p>

<p>"You can, Bill, a deuced sight better than most. How would it
be to get up a subscription through all the travelling
fraternity, to subscribe to a fund to put you in Parliament."</p>

<p>"It might be done, Jim; but they'd all fight over who would be
treasurer. Well, so long. I suppose I must put in an appearance
at Hungry Hartford's, or I shall get no tucker, bad as it is;"
and No 2 resumed his swag and his way.</p>

<p>While discussing Hungry Hartford's rations that night the
conversation he had just had kept running in his head. Why should
he not put up for Parliament? He was as well educated as the
general run of members; he could talk fluently, and had any
amount of assurance. On reflection, he seemed to possess the
usual qualifications, and, thinking over it, he got into his
rough bunk, and fell asleep.</p>

<p><br>
"MR. SPEAKER, standing as I do here on the floor of the
Parliament House of a great and coming nation, with the dust of
honest tramping on my boots, and the taste of bad rations in my
mouth."</p>

<p>These were the words that awoke him, and he found himself in
the gallery of a large hall, looking down upon a gathering of
legislators, one of whom was then addressing the Speaker. The
figure of the speaking member was arrayed in the rough dress of a
swagman, and at his feet lay his rolled blanket; and then he
noticed that there were others amongst the assemblage who were
dressed as swagmen and had their swags lying at their feet; but
somehow, to his practised eye, these men did not look quite the
correct style of thing. But, strangest thing of all, the man who
was addressing the House, was himself. It is not often that a man
is privileged to look upon himself in the flesh, and this was
Bill Denner's strange experience.</p>

<p>His double was still speaking:</p>

<p>"I have the honor to represent a large and important section
of the community, and in the same of the community of swagmen, of
sundowners, as they are more poetically called, I claim that this
bill, authorising a swagmen, when his billy or waterbag leaks, to
obtain a new one from any station owner, should be brought
forward at once. That it will pass, considering the intellectual
status of the legislators of New South Wales, I have not the
slightest doubt. Which of you&mdash;I ask the question with
confidence in tho answer&mdash;would like to be stranded on the
burning plains of the West, with a leaky billy and a waterbag
with holes in it? Not one of you. Then why should these poor men
have to suffer the dangers and disadvantages of such a
misfortune. I leave the matter in the hands of the House,
satisfied that the feelings of humanity, of justice, and of
common altruism, will lead to this most necessary bill being at
once passed."</p>

<p>Now, during the latter part of this speech Bill Denner had
felt a strange kind of compulsory feeling creeping over him,
insisting on him going down and interviewing his double. He rose
from his seat and passed down the stains, seemingly by a mere act
of volition. His feet carried him round, whether he would or no,
to a front entrance, and there he came face to face with the
other Bill Denner.</p>

<p>The attendants and others took no notice of him, seemingly did
not see him, but his counterpart recognised him at once, and
seized him eagerly by the hand.</p>

<p>"So you hare come at last," he said. "I'm very glad; I'm
getting sick of the job; but I've put you in a good place, old
man. Lord, what fun it has been! Mind you keep up to the mark."
He took Denner's arm as he spoke and led him outside.</p>

<p>"But," protested Denner, "don't it seem strange for people to
see two men be much alike together?"</p>

<p>"Lord, man, no one can see you as long as I have your body.
Come along to a quiet place and I'll tell you all I've done."</p>

<p>The pair went on till they came to a small pub with an empty
back room, and they went in and sat down. The double rang the
bell.</p>

<p>"Bring two long beers," he said.</p>

<p>"Two?" said the girl, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, two. I expect a friend here shortly." The girl brought
them in. Then, when she had left the room, Denner poured one down
his dry and dusty throat.</p>

<p>"Now fire away," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, you remember when you went to sleep in the traveller's
hut at Hungry Hartford's station. In point of fact you went off
in a trance, and I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Was I buried?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you were buried right enough, and Hartford was very mad
at your choosing his station to die on. So they didn't bury you
deep, and I soon had you out, and thought I'd have a bit of fun
in your body. As soon as I appropriated your body I found out
what you had been thinking about, and the idea suited me down to
the ground. Now, thinks I, if anybody can engineer this job I
can."</p>

<p>"But who are you?" demanded Denner.</p>

<p>"Oh, one of the fourth spirits, who are allowed to play these
pranks. I went into the thing <i>con amore</i>, and I very soon
was returned as a member, ostensibly for Mudville, but in reality
in the swagman interest. You'd be astonished how the idea took.
The member of the Swagman's Interest became at once an important
member of the House. I have got three bills through
already&mdash;the Improvement of Rations Bill, the Disinfecting
Travellers' Huts Bill, and the 4 o'clock Tea Bill, by which any
traveller arriving at a station can demand afternoon tea if he
comes early. The idea got so popular that other members commenced
to copy the notion, and also my dress; but they can't do the real
thing, as perhaps you have noticed. Anyway, they commenced to
bring dogs in the House to make the thing realistic, but such a
series of free fights followed that it had to be stopped. The
dogs would fight, and then the members they belonged to would
accuse one another of kicking their dogs, and more fights would
follow. Now, I have put things in good working order for you, go
ahead in the path I have marked out for you, only don't make a
mess of things after I have had so much trouble in putting them
right. Now, I'll tell you how you stand. I've saved a bit of
money for you, living as I have done, and I can't take it with
me, for I am going back to the spirit world, here it is, £75;
take it, and pocket it. Now, mind your follow my advice, and
stick to the path I have chalked out. Good-bye, there is somebody
calling me, I must go. Your lodgings are at 47 Duchess Street;
the rent is paid for this month. Good-bye, take care of yourself,
for you are a noted man, and a celebrity in Sydney political
circles."</p>

<p>Denner felt a sharp twinge of pain, and then he was sitting in
the seat occupied by the stranger, and he was alone. Wondering
much, be picked up the swag on the floor, and hoisting it on his
shoulder, made a start out into the street to discover 47
Duchess-street.</p>

<p>With the money in his pocket, he had the sense to avoid the
pubs, and reached his lodgings in safety. They were clean and
tidy, and he was evidently a much respected man there, and was
addressed as Mr. Denner, which was an innovation in a swagman's
life.</p>

<p>He went to bed early, and next morning read in the paper the
brilliant speech made by Denner, M.L.A., the night before, and he
found himself styled the democrat of democrats.</p>

<p>Things went smoothly at first, for he stuck to the advice of
his mysterious friend, and kept to the beaten path that was laid
out for him. He received a deputation of swagmen, who, after
presenting him with a testimonial for the benefits he had already
obtained for them, requested him to introduce a bill to enable
all swagmen to be provided with bicycles, at the expense of the
State.</p>

<p>Gradually, as time went by, there crept over him a fatal
longing for a tall hat. He resisted the fascination as long as
possible, but at last it grew too strong, and he yielded to it.
He bought a tall hat, and in the solitude of his room he tried it
on. He looked in the glass, and shuddered. It was impossible to
wear a top hat with his swagman's shirt and moleskins; no, he
must have his hair and beard cut, and invest in full political
rig; a frock coat must follow, or the old dress be
retained&mdash;a compromise was impossible.</p>

<p>Fearing much, but led on by a fatal impulse, he indulged in
the change of garments. As he stood before the glass, and noted
his different appearance he seemed to hear an echo of mocking
laughter in the room.</p>

<p>When he entered the House that night he was met with covert
sneers and weak jokes. His speech fell flat, and as he looked
upward he met the reproaching gaze of many swagmen in the
gallery.</p>

<p>Next morning the papers alluded to him as the reformed swagman
or the transfigured democrat. From thenceforth his influence
departed. Representative swagmen called on him to resign, and, as
a final effort, he travelled down to the backblocks, there to
address a meeting of his constituents. There was a large
gathering, and a very indignant one, and he quailed as he saw a
vista of swagmen of all ages and sizes, all angry, all indignant,
and all crowding up to the balcony with missiles in their
hands.</p>

<p>"Call yourself a democratic swagman," they roared, "and wear a
top hat and frock coat! Ugh!"</p>

<p>And then a shower of missiles of all sorts were rained on him,
and he felt himself struck on the head. He started, and the whole
scene disappeared from view.</p>

<p><br>
HE was lying in the travellers' hut at Hungry Hartford's, and
the grey dawn was slowly stealing through the chinks in the
slabs.</p>

<p>"What a dream ."' he muttered. "No, I don't think I'll try to
get into Parliament as the swagmen's member. Doesn't suit
me."</p>

<p>He rolled up his swag and marched off along the road just as
the jackasses were beginning their morning song.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>3. &mdash; A HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 2 Sep 1899</h3>

<p class="first">I HAD long been interested in hypnotism, and as
I fondly imagined, understood the science as well as a man
without practical experience could. That was the trouble. In
theory I was perfect, but as yet my practical experience, was
limited to two attempts&mdash;both, I am bound to admit,
failures. At this juncture my wife came to my rescue. She is of a
mild and gentle disposition, and takes great interest in my
scientific researches; but it never occurred to me that she could
act as a subject for my experiments until after a conversation we
held one day on the matter.</p>

<p>'There is a singular development in connection with hypnotism
just recorded in this journal,' I said.</p>

<p>'What is it, Willy?' she asked.</p>

<p>'That if the person hypnotised thinks of some particular
character, whether of history or fiction, whom he or she admires,
they assume that character under the hypnotic influence. Further,
that the hypnotiser can imbue the patient with the notion that he
or she is some historical personage. But that,' I added, 'was
known before. The first part of the paragraph is, however,
novel.'</p>

<p>We talked over it for some time, and presently my dear wife
said shyly&mdash;'Willy, suppose you try and hypnotise me. I will
think of some favorite character. But mind, dear, you will not
make me do anything foolish, will you?'</p>

<p>I assured her that I would not, and we commenced the
experiment. To my astonishment it was a complete success.</p>

<p>'Now, Lucy,' I said, 'tell me who you are?'</p>

<p>The next moment I got a terrible blow in the face that nearly
knocked me down. 'The most infectious pestilence upon thee!' said
my wife. 'Hence, horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes like
balls before me; I'll unhair thy head!'</p>

<p>And she proceeded to do so by hauling me about by my beard,
for I had no hair to speak of.</p>

<p>On she went: 'Thou shalt be whipped with wire and stewed in
brine, smarting in lingering pickle!'</p>

<p>Good heavens! My gentle Lucy, who shrieked at a mouse, was
transformed into Shakespeare's Cleopatra. As well as I could
under the difficult I circumstances I removed the influence, but
my wife had no sooner caught sight of me than she fell back on
the sofa in a faint, with a cry of alarm.</p>

<p>No wonder. The first blow had caused a rush of blood to my
nose, and the second one had swelled my eye, whilst being hauled
about by the beard had left me slightly dishevelled. I must have
been a pitiable sight indeed.</p>

<p>'Oh, what has happened?' she moaned,</p>

<p>'I'll tell you directly,' I said, behind my bloodsoaked
handkerchief. 'I must go and stop this bleeding; it's only my
nose.'</p>

<p>I went to my bedroom, and when the bleeding had somewhat
stopped I told her what had happened.</p>

<p>'Is Cleopatra, as portrayed by Shakespeare, a favorite
character of yours?' I asked.</p>

<p>My wife rather shamefacedly confessed that she did admire the
domineering character of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>Here was a surprise. I should have thought that my wife would
have admired one of the mild heroines of Jane Austen, but this
disclosure took my breath away. It only shows how you can be
married for years and yet not know one another's character.
However, we agreed to drop the experiments at present, but the
thing had given me an idea.</p>

<p>We were not too well off, but I had expectations from an old
aunt. So too unfortunately had another nephew, an idle scapegrace
of a fellow, who would squander all she left him in a year or
two. But, most unjustly, my respected aunt had rather a weakness
for him, and naturally I felt very serious about my inheritance
at times. Why shouldn't I make sure, invite my worthy relative to
stay with me, persuade her to let me hypnotise her, and while in
that condition make her promise to make her will in my favor, to
the exclusion of the other unworthy nephew?</p>

<p>I mentioned the idea to my wife, and she and I arranged the
details of our plot. I found, on consulting all my authorities on
hypnotism, that a promise given under the hypnotic influence
remained binding until the patient was relieved of it by the
hypnotiser. Instances were cited of confirmed drunkards promising
to refrain from drink, and adhering to the promise; and of course
I thought all these cases true. This was satisfactory. If I could
only hypnotise the old lady my future was safe.</p>

<p>My aunt always enjoyed a visit to us. She was fond of her
meals, and my wife was a capital cook; so she came readily on my
invitation. I must admit that her visits were not an unalloyed
blessing, for she took every advantage of her position, and was
as exacting in her demands as one woman could well be. However,
when there is money at stake, one puts up with that sort of
thing, although my wife used to have a good cry every night in
the seclusion of our room. Indeed, I felt at times half inclined
to hypnotise my wife, and let my aunt have a little experience of
her in the character of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>However, my way was partly cleared for me, for my aunt was
deeply interested in the subject of hypnotism, and therefore I
began to talk about it, and the successful (God forgive me)
experiments I had made. We had a series of mock hypnotisms, and
my wife acted her part well, for I was careful not to make the
hypnotism a realism.</p>

<p>The old lady rose to the bait, and expressed a wish to be
hypnotised. It was a nervous moment. What if I failed?</p>

<p>Fortunately, the old lady, my respected aunt, was a willing
subject, and it was not long before I got her off into a real
hypnotic trance; and I proceeded to question her on the subject
of her will. She answered readily enough, and I found out that
beyond a poor £500, the whole of her property was left
unreservedly to her favorite nephew James. I told her that must
be altered at once, and the name of William inserted instead of
James. I hesitated whether I should allow James anything, but
generosity prevailed, and I let him stand in for the £500.</p>

<p>I restored my respected aunt to her senses, and she expressed
herself as much pleased at the success of the process. She stayed
with us a little longer, and I repeated the mesmeric passes, and
thoroughly fixed the will subject on her mind. We parted on the
most affectionate terms, far more affectionate than ever we had
been before.</p>

<p>A fortnight passed, and one day I received simultaneously a
letter and a telegram. I opened the telegram. My dear aunt had
suddenly expired in a fit of apoplexy. Surely we had not overfed
the dear creature? The letter was from her, written the night
before her sudden and lamented death. In it she upbraided me in a
furious manner; said that I had made her a laughing stock and a
show. She discarded me for ever, and I need not expect one penny
of her money.</p>

<p>My wife and I gazed at each other in dismay. What on earth had
occurred?</p>

<p>This is what happened, as I found out afterwards. That villain
James heard somehow, through one of my servants I suppose, about
the hypnotic experiments going on, and he laid a deep and artful
scheme. There was at this time a mountebank performing in the
town, who had a lot of miserable hired subjects whom he used to
make perform all sorts of ludicrous and disgusting tricks under
the pretended mesmeric influence.</p>

<p>To this entertainment James insisted on escorting my aunt She
asked to be taken out after a short time had elapsed, and
appeared very pre-occupied and silent.</p>

<p>'James!' she said, when they got home, 'I have been staying
with William, and while there he hypnotised me. Do you think he
made a show of me, like that man did with his patients?'</p>

<p>'Not a doubt about it,' said the villain.</p>

<p>'What! Made me eat tallow candles and stick pins in
myself?'</p>

<p>'Yes.' In fact, I know, he did from one of the servants.'</p>

<p>My aunt nearly had a fit. Then she dismissed James, and wrote
two letters&mdash;one to me, and one to her lawyers.</p>

<p>The next morning James turned up again, determined to drive
the nail home, and told her a list of my atrocities that he
pretended he had heard. He had just described how I called up the
servants and made her dance a hornpipe before them, when suddenly
she choked, turned red, and went off in a fit of apoplexy from
sheer rage.</p>

<p>James had overdone it.</p>

<p>When the lawyer arrived she was dead. I shall never forget how
James and I glared at one another while the lawyer opened the
will. The hypnotic suggestion had held good, and James had cut
his own throat. William got everything but the £500 which James
got.</p>

<p>'I congratulate you, Mr. William,' said the lawyer. 'Your aunt
only inserted your name about a fortnight ago.'</p>

<p>I have given up hypnotic experiments. I am quite satisfied
about the matter.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>4. &mdash; THE DROUGHT DEMONS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 30 April 1898</h3>

<p class="first">THE river had long ceased running, the water
holes were few and far between, and the cattle had worn long,
dusty pads in and out to their feeding grounds, gradually working
further and further up the ranges that bounded the valley through
which the river ran.</p>

<p>The drought showed no signs of breaking up. True,
thunderstorms gathered, and grew black and threatening; but in
the end they melted away in idle bluster; a few heavy drops of
rain, a flash or two of lightning, some heavy peels of thunder,
and then a storm of drifting, blinding dust. All day the
whirlwinds stalked over the burnt country, tall, revolving black
columns; and, all night the stars shone out of a cloudless sky,
bright, clear, and pitiless.</p>

<p>No moisture was in the air in the early morning, no dew
spangled the tussocks of white, dry grass, that here and there
survived&mdash;all was desolate under the cruel sun that lorded
it all the day. The station horses were too poor to work, even if
there had been anything to do, but sit down and wait for the
rain, which, seemed as though it would never visit that portion
of the earth again.</p>

<p>It was on an out-station in North Queensland that two men were
doomed to keep each other company during this dreary period of
heat and enforced idleness. The elder man managed to pass the
time fairly well, plaiting green-hide into whips, bridles, and
hobbles; the younger, whose tastes did not lie that way, after
one or two ineffectual attempts to learn the knack of it, gave it
up, and read the two or three tattered novels on the place for
the tenth or twelfth time.</p>

<p>'Bob,' he said one morning, 'I shall assuredly go mad if this
lasts much longer. What do you say if we take a trip up to the
head of the river?'</p>

<p>'What for?' asked Bob.</p>

<p>'Just to see where it comes from. You remember when we
followed it up to a gorge twelve months ago, and were blocked by
a waterhole. That hole must be pretty dry. now, and we can get up
higher.'</p>

<p>'What's the good,' muttered Bob, tugging at his plaits; 'only
knocking horses about for nothing&mdash;and they're as fat as
fools now; aren't they?' he added sarcastically.</p>

<p>'Oh! if we go steady, it wont hurt them. I'm dead sick of
staying here doing nothing; we might find something
interesting.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! This river just heads from the coast range just like
all the others. There can't be anything new about it.'</p>

<p>'I don't know. That range seemed very curious to me, and I've
had a hankering to get through that gorge ever since we were up
there. Will you come?'</p>

<p>'Oh! I suppose so. We may as well do something to earn our
rations. You can run some horses up from the four-mile bend this
afternoon. I saw their tracks there the other day.'</p>

<p>The next morning the two men started, taking a packhorse with
them, as they anticipated being away at least three days.</p>

<p><br>
THREE days passed, and three hungry dogs at the out-station
looked vainly for their return, and consulted together as to the
feasibility of going out calf-killing. Three more passed, and the
lean and famished dogs held a council of war, but could decide
nothing, until one of them hit on the happy thought of shifting
their quarters over to the head station, eighteen miles away.</p>

<p>In consequence the residents there were astonished by the
advent of three famished spectres, who were recognised as three
out of the four dogs belonging to the out-station; the fourth had
gone with the two men. Something was wrong evidently, and the
manager and another man started over at once, well-armed,
thinking the blacks might have raided the place.</p>

<p>It was dark when they arrived; but the slab hut, with its grey
roof of bark, stood there, silent and lifeless, with no sign of
any tragedy having taken place. There was a half-moon, and the
night was bright and clear. They dismounted, and, knowing the
secret of the clumsy latch, opened the door and entered. The
manager struck a match, and surveyed the empty interior. As if
the light had aroused something, a long, dismal, melancholy howl
arose from the river, about a hundred yards away. Again and again
it sounded, and the two stared at each other, until the match
burned the superintendent's fingers, and he dropped it
hastily.</p>

<p>'Surely that wasn't a dingo?' he asked. 'Didn't sound like
one; but what else was it?'</p>

<p>'Blessed if I know. 'Twasn't a man, anyhow. Try if you can
find the slush lamp; we'll make up a fire and boil our
quarts.'</p>

<p>The lamp was trimmed, and a fire lighted, the quarts were put
on, and the horses hobbled out to pick up such dry stuff as was
left. The deserted hut had a weird, uncanny appearance, and dark
shadows seemed to hide in the corners, dimly illuminated by the
flickering flame.</p>

<p>'I wish it was morning; we can do nothing till then,' said
Greenwood, the manager.</p>

<p>Of a sudden the cry arose again; but now it came swiftly
towards the house, and with it came a sound like the beat of
heavy wings. Both men had faced death in their lives, and were
plucky enough; but now they were fairly stricken still with
fright. And the cry came near, and circled round the hut, and the
beat or the heavy wings accompanied it; and the wings seemed to
flap against the walls, as though the wailing thing was trying to
find entrance to the light.</p>

<p>'Come on, Dick!' cried Greenwood, in desperation; and flinging
open the door, he rushed out, followed by his companion.</p>

<p>In the still, calm air the trees stood erect and
motionless&mdash;not a bough or leaf stirred. The vertical moon
searched every spot; but all around there was no sign of
anything. The beat of the huge wings was silent; but a sound
came from a distant belt of scrub like some strange being sobbing
in great distress. The horses were standing still, sulking over
the absence of feed, and did not appear to have been
startled.</p>

<p>'We must tie them up to-night,' said Dick, breaking the
silence, 'or they'll be miles away in the morning.'</p>

<p>'What on earth was that thing?' answered Greenwood, unheeding,
and straining his senses to catch any sound or murmur; but all
was quiet.</p>

<p>'Yes; tie them up, Dick,' said the manager, recovering
himself. 'Tie them up in the verandah. They'll be company for
us.'</p>

<p>He laughed mirthlessly, and after the horses had been secured
they turned into the hut, and commenced their interrupted
meal.</p>

<p>The night passed without their being disturbed, and by the
first dawn the men were mounted, and glad to lose sight of the
hut, where they had had such a dreary experience. They managed to
pick up the tracks of the two men, and follow them up the river,
until they got beyond the tracks of the horses' feeding grounds;
then it was pretty easy work, for it was soon evident that the
men were following the river for some purpose or other.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon when they reached a narrow gorge
in the range, through which the river descended, and here their
progress was blocked by a long and, apparently, deep waterhole,
with sheer rocks rising on each side of it; but, strange to say,
although they tracked the two right up to the water's edge, there
were no return tracks.</p>

<p>Greenwood gazed at the water in perplexity. The sides were
steep and inaccessible. Unless they had gone over the range, they
could not have got round the hole. But then there was no turning
back; the tracks went straight into the water, and were lost.</p>

<p>'They must have swum their horses across; but what for?'</p>

<p>It was getting late and their horses had had no feed the night
before, so it was impossible to do anything more that night.
Fortunately, Dick had noticed a patch of grass at the entrance of
the gorge, and they went back there, and turned their hungry
horses out and camped.</p>

<p>All night the silence was unbroken. No weird cries disturbed
their restless naps, and no phantoms came to their camp, beating
the air with invisible wings.</p>

<p>In the morning Greenwood determined to leave their horses
where they were, there being no sign of blacks about, and try and
get over the side of the gorge on foot. This they did, and in due
course arrived at a point from which they could see the end of
the water-hole, and some of the country beyond. But to theirs
astonishment the end was impassable, blocked up by huge boulders
and fallen rocks, a complete barricade.</p>

<p>'Whoever went in that hole never came out at the end,' said
Dick.'</p>

<p>Greenwood examined the place carefully.</p>

<p>'It seems to me that those rocks have fallen recently. There's
been a landslip lately.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps since they went through, and they can't get back,'
suggested Dick. 'They would have managed it on foot; more likely
the landslip caught them and their horses. Let's get as close as
we can.'</p>

<p>They clambered on until they were right over the ruin below,
and in sight of the country beyond the gorge.</p>

<p>A terrible looking place it was too, a barren, rocky basin,
seemingly without vegetation of any sort. The course of the river
could still be traced, showing a little water at intervals. But
the singular thing about the landscape was that it was dotted
over, with isolated, fantastic-looking rocks that took little
imagination to conjure into eccentric and devilish forms, most of
them like huge bats with extended wings.</p>

<p>'Blow me!' said Dick, 'but I never see'd rocks like that
before.'</p>

<p>'Nor I either. Let's see if we can get down and find any
tracks.'</p>

<p>After some trouble they reached the lower ground, and stood at
the upper end of the water hole that blocked the gorge, above the
huge mass of debris and rocks that formed an impassable
barricade. Just above this Greenwood drew his companion's
attention to a spring issuing from the scarred face of the
cliff.</p>

<p>'I have it,' he said, after a little consideration. 'That hole
was nearly dry when they came here, and they rode through it
easily, then came this landslip, and that spring broke out and
filled the hole up again.'</p>

<p>'We ought to find them up here then?'</p>

<p>'I'm afraid something has happened; they could have got back
the way we came.'</p>

<p>'Dashed queer-looking place,' said Dick, looking round. Now
that they were down in the basin the outlook was more weird than
from up above. The strange isolated rocks rose up in front of
them like an army of grotesque forms suddenly turned into stone.
Greenwood went over to examine one of them. His footsteps made a
hollow ring rise from the bare, flat rock, as though it was
cavernous. He called Dick over.</p>

<p>'These things are easily accounted for,' he said. 'There's a
soft stratum in this rock, and in heavy floods this flat we are
on is all submerged, and that stratum has been washed away, and
the hard rock left, standing. Look! there are one or two where
the soft stuff has been washed clean away, and the rock has
tumbled over.'</p>

<p>He pointed out the objects he was speaking of, but Dick, after
looking at them, suddenly exclaimed, 'What's that there, Mr.
Greenwood? There's something lying there as isn't a rock.'</p>

<p>They hastened over to it, and found to their dismay the
clean-picked skeleton of a horse.</p>

<p>'Twasn't the crows did that, or dingoes either,' said Dick
after a long pause. 'Besides there's no sign of them about.'</p>

<p>Both men stood silent and listened, but the stillness was
unbroken by even the common sounds of the bush.</p>

<p>'Not a scrap of anything left but the bones,' remarked
Greenwood, after examining the remains. 'Do you think it is one
of theirs?'</p>

<p>Dick looked puzzled. Then he stooped down and examined one of
the feet.</p>

<p>'It's old Ranger,' he said. 'See this crack in his hoof. When
I was over a fortnight ago I put a shoe on for Bob to stop Ranger
going lame. This is the shoe.'</p>

<p>'It's no good looking for tracks on this hard rock, but we
must have a search round, anyhow. Don't get out of hearing, but
cooee to me occasionally, and I'll answer. Fire a shot if you
want me.'</p>

<p>The men parted and soon lost sight of each other amongst the
standing pinnacles, but kept touch of each other's whereabouts by
calling out at intervals. Presently Greenwood heard a shot, and
going in the direction found Dick standing over the skeleton of a
dog. Like the other the bones were picked clean and bare.</p>

<p>'Wonder how many horses they had with them?' said Dick.</p>

<p>'Wonder what sort of thing it is that has done this. It's not
been done by anything in the bush that we know of, and I don't
think there's much we don't know of.'</p>

<p>'By jingo! suppose they tackle our horses while we are away,'
said Dick, and the thought made both men start.</p>

<p>'We must find something of Bob and young Daly before we
leave,' returned Greenwood firmly, 'or come back to-morrow and
keep on until we do. Whatever's left of them must be about here.
We'll follow the river for a bit; it's early in the day yet.'</p>

<p>They followed the river up for a couple of miles, and found it
only a channel worn in the solid rock, which spread on either
side. No soil, no trees, nothing but the strange pinnacles all
around them. They saw the ranges closing in ahead, and turned
back without having found any clue.</p>

<p>'I have often wondered why this river came down so quickly,'
said Greenwood. 'The water would accumulate in this barren, rocky
basin and burst through the gorge with a rush?'</p>

<p>'By God! there's Bob,' suddenly interrupted Dick, running
forward and calling Greenwood followed him, and found him
wondering and perplexed.</p>

<p>'I'll swear I saw him as plain as I can see you, and he seemed
to dodge behind one of these rocks, and now he ain't here.'</p>

<p>'It's strange he didn't answer you and come to us.'</p>

<p>'Strange. The old fellow must have got a touch of the sun and
gone dotty. I've heard that they keep away when they are like
that.'</p>

<p>'At any rate we must get on. If you saw him he must have seen
and heard you.'</p>

<p>'If,' muttered Dick, aggrieved. 'I tell you, Mr. Greenwood, I
did see him. Bob! Bob Blackburn!' he shouted.</p>

<p>Every echo in the ranges shouted back, 'Bob! Bob Blackburn!'
but the cries were only echoes, and the two started again.</p>

<p>'There he is!' exclaimed Greenwood. 'You were right, Dick.
Blackburn, here we are!'</p>

<p>He had gone again. They looked round every pinnacle and rock,
but he was not in hiding anywhere.</p>

<p>Astonished and somewhat uneasy, the two resumed their way, and
all the way to the gorge the mysterious figure appeared ahead, to
first one, then the other, of them, and when they reached the
gorge both saw it standing on the top of the tumbled rocks and
boulders, and there it vanished.</p>

<p>The two looked at each other, and whispered awe-struck, 'You
saw it too.'</p>

<p>Their nerves were getting a bit unhinged, but after a little
they rallied.</p>

<p>'We must search these rocks,' said Greenwood. 'You saw where
that thing disappeared?'</p>

<p>'Yes, what was it? It was Bob, and it wasn't Bob. However,
we'll find out.'</p>

<p>Talking pretty loudly to keep one another's courage up, the
two men commenced to climb the mass of fallen boulders to reach
the place where they had seen the figure standing.</p>

<p>At times a boulder slipped and rolled down with a rumbling
sound, and it was after one of these mishaps and some bad
language from Dick, who had slipped, that they heard a cry, a
voice seemingly calling for help. It seemed to float all round
them; they could not locate it.</p>

<p>'It was a human voice, at any rate,' said Greenwood, and he
shouted loudly in answer.</p>

<p>Again came the cry, but now they were on the watch, and were
able to place it.</p>

<p>'It comes from underneath,' said Dick. 'One of 'em is buried
alive.'</p>

<p>They were now close to the spot where the wraith had been
seen, and a little search soon showed a rift, opening into a
cavity under their feet. Greenwood stooped down and shouted:</p>

<p>'Any one there?'</p>

<p>His voice rumbled round the opening, which was apparently of
some size, and an answer came back:</p>

<p>'Yes; Daly!'</p>

<p>It seemed some distance below, and Greenwood called out to
know if it were safe to drop.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid not,' returned the imprisoned man. 'I'll crawl
underneath, and you can judge.'</p>

<p>'What's the matter?'</p>

<p>'My leg's hurt; we got buried by a fall of rocks; but one big
one has fallen across and saved me.'</p>

<p>'Where's Bob?' cried out Dick.</p>

<p>'He was killed, I hope. But something came and took him out.
But I will tell you all. First get me out, get me out of
this.'</p>

<p>After a time the entombed man stood beneath them, and by means
of their belts and a handkerchief they managed to ascertain that
there was nearly twelve feet of a drop.</p>

<p>'You're the strongest man, and I am the lightest,' said Dick;
'I'll drop down&mdash;you can lower me as far as you can.'</p>

<p>Greenwood lay down, and Dick lowered himself down and hung on
by the edge of the hole; then Greenwood took his wrists and
lowered him as far as he could and Dick reached the bottom
safely.</p>

<p>'How have you lived all this time?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The pack-horse was killed too, and I managed to get the bags
off, and there's water here.'</p>

<p>'How do you propose to get out?' shouted Greenwood, from the
top.</p>

<p>'Hanged if I know. Daly can only stand on one leg, and he's
mighty shaky. Could you cut some saplings, and&mdash;'</p>

<p>'Saplings!' retorted Greenwood.' 'You know there's nothing
here but rocks.</p>

<p>'Pile some rocks up,' said the wounded man. 'I commenced to do
it, but had to give up.'</p>

<p>'That's the only way, unless you wait here another night.'</p>

<p>'No!' called out Daly, in a voice of terror, 'it's at night if
comes. Not another night.'</p>

<p>'Go ahead, Dick,' shouted Greenwood. 'I'll collect some on top
as well, and drop them down. Stand from under when I sing
out.'</p>

<p>The two men worked hard, for the afternoon was now wearing on,
and at last had a heap high enough to enable Dick to assist Daly
to crawl to the top, and from there Greenwood was able to reach
down and help him, and they got him out. He was worn and haggard
from pain and misery, but they forbore to ask him any questions,
only Greenwood descended into the hole and examined it.</p>

<p>A great slab of the cliff seemed to have fallen forward, and
got chocked in a leaning position. The rocks and rubble had
rolled off this and blocked the sides. Daly called out to him to
look at the lowest end behind the stones, and he would find the
pack bags, tomahawk, and surcingle. Greenwood struck some
matches, and by their aid found a sort of barricade of stones
erected, and behind the articles specified. He handed them up,
and followed himself.</p>

<p>'What was that barricade for?' he asked Daly.</p>

<p>'To hide from the thing that comes at night. It took away Bob
and the horses.'</p>

<p>They asked no more, but set to work to help the hurt man away.
It was a hard task, but, thanks to the moon, they succeeded in
getting him over the range, and found the camp as they had left
it. The horses had not strayed away, and, as Greenwood said, they
were luckier than they deserved to be.</p>

<p>The next morning; after a sound sleep, Daly felt somewhat
recovered and told his story.</p>

<p><br>
'WHEN we came to the waterhole in the gorge, we found it quite
shallow, not over our horses' knees, so we rode through it,
meaning to camp on the top side of the gorge. When we got in
sight of the open country we saw that it was all flat rock, and
no place to camp, so we pulled up and were talking of coming back
here, to this place, which he had noticed, when there was a
tremendous crash, and the cliff seemed to fall in on us. We were
knocked down by the stones, for the big rock did not touch us,
but in fact saved my life. I believe they were all killed at
once, Bob, the horses, and the dog. I was bruised, but the worst
blow I got was this one on my ankle. As I lay there, half stunned
and stupid, I heard the rocks raining down on the huge slab that
protected me, until at last it grew darker, and I knew that I was
completely shut in, I got up, and found that I could only stand
on one leg. I limped about, and at last got underneath the
opening, and wondered if I could get out. The moon was not very
strong, then, so I had to wait till morning, at daylight I
commenced to look about, and saw poor old Bob and the horses and
dog all lying in the dim light, quite still; just where they had
fallen before the big slab came down and saved them from being
crushed. Then I began to collect stones to make a stand to
clamber out through the hole, but I hurt my foot trying to stand
on it, and had to give over. I took the bags off the pack-horse,
and that night the thing came.</p>

<p>'I first heard a cry, far away, come nearer and nearer... It
was not a human cry, but like nothing I have heard before. It
came close, I heard a noise like the beating of great wings, and
then something commenced to clamber up the rocks outside, and
there was a noise like sobbing; then the hole was darkened; and
presently I heard something rustling and crawling about the place
inside. I crouched in the leaning corner as far as I could, and
then I heard the noise of something being dragged, along the
rock, then the light came back through the hole, and I heard the
howling again. This time it was answered; other things came up
howling and crying, and once more the hole was darkened, and the
dragging sound recommenced. Sometimes the thing crawling about
seemed to come quite close to me, but it never touched me. At
last the light of the stars was visible once more, and with great
crying and the flapping of many wings the things departed; but
for a long time I heard the wailing noise they made.</p>

<p>'In the morning I saw to my horror that Bob and the horses and
dog had been taken away. I tried all I knew to get out, but only
made my ankle worse, and I felt like blowing my brains out, for I
saw no hope of anyone coming to my assistance. But I thought I'd
stick to life as long as I could, for surely I could manage to
make a hole somehow amongst the loose stones. So I gathered all
the boulders I could crawl with and barricaded the low end of the
cavern, for I was sure the horrid things would come back again.
They did; every night there has been hooting and calling, and
something rustling and searching about the cave. Whatever it was
they could not get in altogether; but I think the awful things
had a trunk that they thrust in, and it was not long enough to
reach me. How I lived through it I don't know. It has put its
mark on me for my life.'</p>

<p>After some further questions, Greenwood told Daly of the
experiences he and Dick had been through, the winged thing that
came to the hut, which was evidently one of the creatures that
had been at the cave; how the ghostly appearance of poor Bob
Blackburn led them to the opening, but for which probably he
would not have been found.</p>

<p>'Then,' finished Greenwood grimly, 'I'm going to find out what
these things are.'</p>

<p>'Take me home first,' cried Daly; 'I can stand no more.'</p>

<p>'Yes, we must go home first; there are a few things I want to
prepare. Dick, you'll see the matter out?'</p>

<p>'Rather,' returned Dick, with force and brevity.</p>

<p>By easy stages, they took Daly to the head station, and then
Greenwood made his preparations for a start.</p>

<p>The story, of course, had been told, and talked of, and the
evening before Dick and he and a third volunteer were going to
start, his black boy came to him with a tale he had heard from an
old gin. No blacks went up that river now, though once, right, at
the head of it, a large tribe used to camp; for there was a big
lagoon there with fish and ducks in plenty.</p>

<p>One year it was fearfully dry, and some strange things came to
the lagoon, flying things that killed the blacks, and sucked all
their flesh away. The fish died in the lagoon, for the water
turned black and stinking, the trees around it died; and what
natives were left fled for their lives. Then the story went
amongst the blacks that these awful things only came out when
there had been no rain for a long, long time, and only when the
rain came did they leave for the unknown places they came from.
The description given of these creatures by the old gin was
vague; but it agreed with what Greenwood had guessed.</p>

<p><br>
THE next morning they started. After some trouble they found a
way up the range, by which they could take their horses, and
following the range round they finally arrived at the river
again, having thus gone round one side of the rocky basin. Just
beyond should lie the lagoon, if there was any truth in the
blacks' yarn. Expectantly, they looked over the crest, of the
range, and there, sure enough, was a dismal black lagoon,
surrounded by skeleton trees, in the midst of a barren, desolate
tract of land. No sign of life was visible.</p>

<p>They descended but could not approach the water, as the ground
became marshy and boggy. The whole country seemed under a blight
and a curse: Once Greenwood thought he saw a dark, undulating
body rise above the gloomy surface, but he was never sure. His
plans were formed, he had only come to make certain of the
lagoon's existence. They turned their horses' heads back, and
returned to their old camp at the end of the first gorge.</p>

<p>The next day they, were busy at work at the cave where Daly
had been entombed. Having finished their work there, they
repaired to the side opposite to where the hind slip had been,
and after some trouble made a rude pathway, by which a lower
ledge could be reached. Greenwood had brought a coil of fuse and
some dynamite cartridges, intended for timber-splitting. He was
going to try its effects on a little trap, he had thought of. The
edge of the fallen slab looked very shaky, a charge might start
it, and if so it would pin down any animal or thing with its head
in the hole.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant moonlight night, now only a few days before
full moon, when the watches took their position on the cliff,
Greenwood being concealed: on the ledge, where the fuse
terminated.</p>

<p>At last, the hooting and the beat of wings was heard; and in
the moonlight they saw a huge dark shape come in sight, and drop
on its feet at the side of the hole. Still bent on getting its
victim, it thrust the long trunk it had into the aperture, and
commenced to explore it, its enormous black bulk standing clearly
defined, the wings propping at its sides. Dick nearly uttered an
exclamation, for there was a stealthy step at his side. But it
was only Greenwood, who had lit the fuse and joined them for
safety.'</p>

<p>Some anxious minutes passed, then, the horrible thing lifted
its head, and gave vent to the howls they had heard before.
Greenwood was afraid, that the cartridges might explode while the
thing had its head raised, but it plunged it in once more, and,
as it did so, the explosion rang out, and the huge slab slipped
down, and pinned it there.</p>

<p>The din that arose was awful. From far away came swift
approaching hoots in answer to the cries of their desperate and
struggling companion. They assembled round him to the number of
half-a-dozen or so, and a babel of sound came up.</p>

<p>The men crouched in terror, dreading discovery when there
suddenly came a loud crack and a dull grinding noise, followed by
an almighty crash. The explosion had started another fall in the
opposite cliff, and an avalanche came crashing on the monsters. A
cloud of dust arose, thick with waiting cries; then followed
another fall.</p>

<p>Out of the dust reek, Greenwood saw some gigantic form emerge,
and sail away with a thunderous beating of wings, and then the
cloud cleared and settled, but all was quiet down below, only the
cliff they were on still seemed to rock with the concussion. The
gorge was piled half full of rocks and rubble, but the creatures
who had been caught in the fall were buried under tons and tons
of rock.</p>

<p>The next day the rain clouds burst in fury, and since then the
drought-demons have never been seen.</p>

<p>Only a white-headed man named Daly still tells to everyone who
will listen his strange story. He is slightly deranged, and has
been ever since that time.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>5. &mdash; THE MURDER OF TOM BATES</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 29 August 1896</h3>

<p class="first">"SAME old fence," said the swagman, as he
contemplated an erratic piece of fencing by the side of the road.
"That crooked tree still alive that Jim Staines hung himself on.
It's quite pleasant to come back from one's wanderings and be
welcomed by the old familiar objects such as these."</p>

<p>The swagman pulled out his pipe, and proceeded to fill it with
a musing kind or air.</p>

<p>"Nine years since I was in this place, and blest if I think
there's any change in it. Bet two to one old Jarmyn is still in
the verandah looking out for travellers, and telling everybody of
the roaring nights of the old days." He smoked on for a time,
then a smile stole over this weather-worn features, and he
resumed the swag he had thrown down, and went on his way.</p>

<p>"Darned if I don't do it," he muttered; "I've just enough coin
to carry it through."</p>

<p>Maranoo, the township he was approaching, was just about the
sleepiest of all the sleepy bush townships of New South Wales. A
good-sized pocket handkerchief would have covered it. The one and
only street was grass-grown to such a degree that it was
generally used as a common. The daring stranger who walked down
it during midday roused up disgusted milkers chewing their cud,
and woke from pleasant dreams the sleeping horses. But in the
opinion of the citizens of Maranoo a halo of glory still stuck to
the place which time could not eradicate.</p>

<p>There had once been a gold field in its immediate
neighborhood, and the memory of that field was the badge of honor
of the Maranoos. True, the field had been of the smallest and
poorest, but gold had been got there, and as years passed the
nuggets increased in size and weight, and the mad orgies of the
diggers were spoken of with bated breath. Nay, by whom started it
was never known, but there were rumors of a deep lead, of such
wonderful richness that, if once traced, the fortunes of Maranoo
and the inhabitants thereof would be made for ever.</p>

<p>The swagman, whose name was Bates, had been on the field
during its short-lived existence, and had been personally known
to many of the inhabitants, having been one of those who had made
a little&mdash;a very little&mdash;gold.</p>

<p>"Don't suppose they'll know me again, with my hair all white
like it is. However, I'll chance it," and revolving these
thoughts, he marched on along the road.</p>

<p>Soon the great township of Maranoo hove in sight, the first
house, naturally, being a pub. There was old Jarmyn, as he had
anticipated, still on the lookout for the diggers to return and
rouse the welkin with festivity.</p>

<p>The architecture of the town was poor and simple in the
extreme, but it sufficed, for the inhabitants did not put on
airs. So long as they could spit in the road from their own
doorway they were content.</p>

<p>The swagman pulled up at the old pub known to fame as the
Digger's Rest, and throwing his swag on the verandah floor,
greeted old Jarmyn with the intelligence that it was blanky hot
for the time of year.</p>

<p>Jarmyn, after taking in the astounding fact that the newcomer
was a stranger in reality, and not one of the townspeople
masquerading as such, got up and proceeded methodically behind
the bar, the shelves of which were mostly stocked with
dummies.</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do," said Bates. "P'raps you'll join me,"
and he ostentatiously drew forth some silver. Jarmyn had no
objection, and joined.</p>

<p>"You don't mind a fellow here in the old diggings days of the
name of Bates&mdash;Tom Bates&mdash;do ye?" asked the
swagman.</p>

<p>"Bates! Name seems familiar like. A sort of cross-eyed,
down-looking chap, was he?"</p>

<p>"Not at all. Eyes as straight as your'n&mdash;might have had a
black 'un occasionally."</p>

<p>"Bates&mdash;Tom Bates. Of course," said the landlord,
changing his tack, for even a swagman was a rare and precious
being. "Now I mind him. I was thinking of Tom Gulliver. Yes,
Bates. Friend of yours?"</p>

<p>"Rather. He and I went to West Australia, together."</p>

<p>"What, that 'ere Coolgardie I've heard tell on? Do anything
there?"</p>

<p>"Me and Tom did first-rate at first, but he was allus
a-hankering after something he'd left behind here. Weighed on his
mind, it did, until he took sick with typhoid."</p>

<p>"Did he die?" said the landlord.</p>

<p>"Not he! Tom Bates die of typhoid&mdash;no fear! We got
stone-broke, and the stonier we got the more Bates talked of
Maranoo, and what there was there he'd left behind."</p>

<p>"What was it?" asked the landlord, filling the traveller's
glass again. "Ah! that he never told me. Only he used to say,
'Just you wait, Jim Thomson, until we get back to Maranoo, and
we'll just paint the town the bloomiest red ever was. You see,
old Jarmyn (that's just what he said) 'll just go clean off his
chump with joy when I tell him about it, and plump down a
twenty-ounce nugget, and say, Drinks all round, and take it
out o' that.'"</p>

<p>"I always did believe in the old times coming back," commented
the interested Jarmyn.</p>

<p>By this time the news had travelled round that there was a
stranger in the town, and one after another the Maranoos walked
in. The talk became general, and all the old residents claimed to
have known Tom Bates.</p>

<p>"And where may he be now?" asked the landlord.</p>

<p>"Tom Bates! Why, the poor old chap, he's lying dog sick in the
orsepittal in Gobungalong. 'Jim,' he says to me, 'I'll pull round
right enough. You go ahead, and wait for me at Maranoo, and the
time we'll have of it&mdash;my colonial!'"</p>

<p>"I suppose," said the landlord, "he didn't let on where it
was, did he?"</p>

<p>"He did not. I tell you, we was stone-broke and busted in West
Australia, and just for the lack of turning up a slug or two we'd
never have got back."</p>

<p>All eyes were fixed on the man who had really been to West
Australia, which most of the Maranoos imagined to be somewhere in
the neighborhood of New Zealand, and they had no notion exactly
where that was.</p>

<p>"What did you want to turn up slugs for?" demanded a
native-born Maranoosian. The traveller smiled in a superior
manner.</p>

<p>"Slugs is nuggets out there," he condescended to explain.</p>

<p>"When do you think Tom Bates will arrive?" asked the
landlord.</p>

<p>Jim Thomson, as he called himself, hesitated. "I want to have
a little talk with you about that," he said. "Something atween
ourselves&mdash;say, after dinner."</p>

<p>It being about that hour, the Maranoos dispersed, talking as
they went of the interest to be aroused in their town and the
probable disposal of unsalable town allotments.</p>

<p>"It's just this way with Tom Bates," said the hypocrite, after
putting away a good, sturdy feed. "I told you as how we were both
nigh stumped. Now, when Bates got took bad, and had to lay up in
the orsepittal at Gobungalong, he says to me, 'Jim, you take what
we've got left, and push on to Maranoo. If there's any of the
real old sort who remember Tom Bates, they might advance a little
loan, and down I'd come hot foot, and in less than a fortnight
you see that place will just roar again!"</p>

<p>The landlord mused solemnly.</p>

<p>"Have a drink," said the traveller, jumping up.</p>

<p>"Mind you, I don't say as they will do it," remarked the
landlord after the drinks had been swallowed. "But I don't mind
sounding the leading townspeople, and together we might make up a
little. How much do you think would be wanted?"</p>

<p>"Say, a matter of five pounds. What's that when you'll have
fifty&mdash;aye, and fifties&mdash;pass over this very counter
night after night," and he thumped the counter heavily as though
anxious that it should bear witness to the truth of his
prediction. Jarmyn nodded approvingly at the sentiment, and they
parted for a while.</p>

<p>Now, amongst the townspeople there was, as there usually is in
most sleepy-headed bush towns, a man of wonderful acuteness and
discernment. In this case the local wiseacre was a kind of
carpenter, painter, and Jack-of-all-trades. His name was Coop,
and he had once had a wonderful experience. No less than being
summoned to Sydney as a witness in a law case. True his evidence
had not been required after all; but his expenses had been paid,
and as time went on he persuaded himself that he had figured with
great distinction in the witness box, had been put through a
severe cross-examination by the opposing counsel, whom he had
signally put to confusion. When there had been much excitement in
the way of extra drinks, he was in the habit of adding something
about a banquet and presentation by his Sydney admirers; but this
was looked upon with suspicion.</p>

<p>Now, the case of Tom Bates was one to ponder over. He came to
the conclusion that, as he expressed it, there was something in
it. What that something was he could not explain; but as he was
in the habit of remarking, "They can't take an old fox like me
in. I've been to Sydney, and learnt all the tricks of the trade.
It's my belief"&mdash;then a brilliant idea came to
him&mdash;"Tom Bates has been murdered."</p>

<p>When it came to the matter of making up the £5 he gave nothing
himself, but he urged the others to do so.</p>

<p>"Give him rope enough," he said, "it's my belief that that £5
will unearth a ghastly crime."</p>

<p>He communicated his suspicions to the local policeman, when
that worthy would be sufficiently awake to listen to him. He held
out a vision of promotion and stripes to him. He argued that a
murder discovered in Maranoo would give the town as much
notoriety as a new gold field. He made himself an objectionable
nuisance, even to the easy-going Maranoos.</p>

<p>The £5 was collected, and handed over in one note to the
swagman, who publicly placed it in an envelope with a letter,
urging Tom Bates to immediately hasten to Maranoo, dead or alive,
and point out the scene of the future rush. This envelope, with
enclosure, was solemnly handed over to Jarmyn to post and
register, and he rose to the occasion and shouted for all hands
to drink success to the new rush.</p>

<p>"It's my belief," said the knowing man to the policeman, "that
he's suspicious of us. He saw that I read him like a book, and I
noticed he changed color. I must have seen him when I was in the
court in Sydney. If he heard me trounce that barrister no wonder
that he felt queer all over."</p>

<p>The policeman yawned. He was rather tired of Coop.</p>

<p>Another bright idea now occurred to Coop. As he was in the
habit of saying, "Give me the opportunity, and see me rise to
it." He determined to watch the pub that night to see that the
guilty man did not escape. He did so, but without result. Not to
be done, however, he invented such an adventurous recital of the
night's proceeding, that he staggered even the constable. If Coop
was willing to swear anything&mdash;no matter what&mdash;before
the local J.P.&mdash;he would take upon himself to arrest the
traveller on suspicion, but without the ceremony of swearing he
professed that the law could do nothing.</p>

<p>Coop hesitated, but led on by vain glory, made an affidavit
that to the best of his belief the man Thompson had murdered his
mate Bates, in order to obtain possession of information
concerning the whereabouts of a rich deposit of gold in the
abandoned workings at Maranoo. It took a lot of trouble to induce
the policeman to assist in the night watch, but Coop assured him
that it must lead to fortune, and he consented to try an hour or
two.</p>

<p>No one was more surprised than Coop when, after all had
retired, they saw the traveller emerge from the public house,
swag on shoulder. He stood still for a minute, looked up and down
the deserted road; then, taking what is known as "a sight" at the
building he was leaving, strode off.</p>

<p>Coop nudged the policeman, and they followed. "Be careful,"
whispered Coop, trembling somewhat, "he's a desperate man."</p>

<p>But the policeman, if stolid, was not afraid. He walked
quickly after the swagman, who turned sharply when he heard the
following footsteps.</p>

<p>"I arrist you on suspicion of having caused the death of one
Thomas Bates, and ivery word you say will be used against you,"
he gabbled off.</p>

<p>The traveller stood quietly enough taking in the sense of what
he said, then burst out laughing. "Hang it all mate, it's only a
joke. I'm Thomas Bates myself."</p>

<p>"Oh that be blowed," said Coop, who had recovered confidence
on seeing that there was no bloodshed imminent. "I knew Tom
Bates well, none better. We were like brothers when he was
here."</p>

<p>But the swagman still laughed. "You fool, Coop, don't you
remember me? Not that we were ever very chummy, but many's the
time I've shouted drinks for you when I had the stuff. Look here,
I tell you I'm Tom Bates, so how can I have murdered myself?"</p>

<p>The policeman was puzzled. "If you had, it would be suicide,
and I arrest you for murder."</p>

<p>"Arrest me! You can't arrest me for killing myself when I'm
alive!"</p>

<p>"Oh, but I can, though, and I do. Coop here swears that you
made away with one Thomas Bates."</p>

<p>"Coop does? Look here, you little varmint, I'll bring a double
action against you for destitution of character and illogical
imprisonment. How about that wife you deserted in Rattington? How
about that drunken man you choked?"</p>

<p>Coop waited to hear no more, but departed.</p>

<p>"Have I got to go with you because that bally little liar has
told you some cock and bull story?"</p>

<p>"Yes; we must have it cleared up now. Come along."</p>

<p>The swagman went.</p>

<p>So impressed were the townspeople with their belief in their
coming benefactor Tom Bates that they absolutely refused to
recognise the real Simon Pure, and Coop met with universal scorn
and derision for starting the trouble. Moreover, the policeman
related the accusations the swagman had thrown at him, and his
wife coming to hear of it, the life of poor Coop became a burden
and a reproach, besides which he was haunted by a dread of divers
and unknown penalties being inflicted on him in the event of the
traveller being Bates himself.</p>

<p>The case went up to the neighboring town, but as it all rested
on the alleged disappearance of a man whose existence no one was
sure of, there was naturally nothing in it. Gobungalong being
appealed to, replied that everyone but a wooden-headed Maranoo
man knew that there was no such thing as an hospital in
Gobungalong; consequently, there never had been a Tom Bates
there. The letter containing the enclosure was returned.</p>

<p>The traveller was discharged, accordingly, with a stern
admonition not to come to that part of New South Wales again
playing jokes on quiet people. He apologised; said that he only
wanted to walk the first few miles in the cool night, his meals
had been paid for, he had committed no crime&mdash;would the
bench see fit to grant him something from the poor-box to help
him along after this unjust and unlawful detention.</p>

<p>The presiding magistrate said that he was very sorry, but
there was no poor-box. The Maranoo people should give him
something by way of compensation; but they had all hastily left
the court.</p>

<p>Jarmyn assembled the subscribers and paid them back their
subscriptions to the Bates fund; then he locked the note up, and
Maranoo was happy and sleepy, once more.</p>

<p>One month afterwards the disgusted commercial who paid Maranoo
a periodical visit came on his rounds. Jarmyn had an account with
him, and handed him the torn £5 note in payment.</p>

<p>The commercial looked at it, smiled, and gave it back. "What's
the matter with it?" asked the astonished publican. "Aint it a
good 'un?"</p>

<p>"It was once upon a time," replied the commercial, "but that
bank is one of those that have burst up."</p>

<p>Jarmyn looked at the commercial in astonishment and dismay.
"Why, I got it from the branch bank in Oraka myself, and the bank
was open the other day."</p>

<p>He looked again at the note long and wistfully. "Blamed if I
think it's the same," he muttered. Nor was it. The note had been
changed by the swagman&mdash;a common enough trick, and not
requiring much dexterity, as the commercial explained.</p>

<p>"Bust me, if he didn't want compensation!" roared Jarmyn.
"I'll compensate him if I catch him!"</p>

<p>Strange to say, the townsfolk, while most sympathetic, did not
see their way to handing back the contributions Jarmyn had
returned to them, and there are now two factions in the once
sleepy town. The Jarmynites are those who did not subscribe, and
the anti-Jarmynites are those who did. Both parties detest Coop,
and the policeman is watching for an excuse to run him in.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>6. &mdash; A FATAL GAMBLE</h2>

<h3><i>Australasian</i>, Melbourne, Australia, 4 May 1907</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">THE man in the boat stood up and looked at the
shore he was slowly approaching; it appeared to be lonely and
uninhabited. A sandy core, almost directly opposite, invited a
landing, and that was the most hospitable thing to be seen. But
the prospect seemed to please the man in the boat. He sat down
and pulled wearily to the land, directing his course towards a
clump of mangroves at the southern end of the little beach. The
sea was calm, for the day was almost windless, and he landed
without experiencing any difficulty. First, concealing the
battered craft amongst the mangroves, he then hunted amongst the
rocks above high-water mark till he found a little hole, still
containing fresh water, left by a storm of the preceding day. Of
this he drank deeply, and returning to the boat, took from the
stern locker the scant materials for a meal, and sitting down
devoured them ravenously.</p>

<p>"A wasted life," he muttered to himself when he had finished.
"To think that in my despair and madness I should have urged him
on to a needless death;" he arose and shook his clenched fist on
high with a dramatic gesture. "But that traitor, that devil shall
pay for it with his blood, I swear."</p>

<p>His next proceeding was to load the boat with heavy stones,
push her into deep water, and sink her, so as to hide all traces
of his landing. Then he lay down upon the hot sand to rest. At
first he slept but little, being evidently disturbed by
tormenting dreams, but exhaustion won the battle at last, and he
sank into a dreamless sleep, that lasted until daylight the next
morning. Then he arose, and meditating for a short time, turned
his face to the south, and strode along the beach.</p>

<p>He knew that he was on the north coast of Queensland, but how
far he would have to toil on before meeting with any help, he
knew not. At last, towards noon, he espied a light-ship, moored
at her anchorage no great distance from the shore; beyond, a
spur from the range ran down into the sea, and formed a jutting
cape. He stopped and pondered.</p>

<p>"Government dogs," he said at last, talking to himself as men
used to solitude do, and there was a note of hatred in his low
voice. "No, I will not surrender, unless obliged. I will look
over the ridge ahead first." He struggled on, although evidently
wearied out, and it was a couple of hours before he stood on the
crest of the cape, and was able to command an extended view to
the south. As he looked he gave vent to an exclamation of
satisfaction. Some miles away a lugger was anchored close to the
beach.</p>

<p>"Trepang fishers. I can trust them," he muttered, and resumed
his weary march. The sun had sunk behind the range, when, at
last, completely worn out, he stood on the beach opposite the
lugger, and, mustering all his remaining strength, hailed her.
The hail was heard, and answered, and, after a few minutes, a man
got into the dinghy that was floating alongside, and sculled to
the beach. The wanderer waded in to meet him. The fisherman, a
genial looking fellow, gazed knowingly at him.</p>

<p>"Noumea?" he said, as a matter of course.</p>

<p>"Yes, Noumea, and starving;" returned the escapee in good
English.</p>

<p>"Didn't you see the lightship as you came?"</p>

<p>"I did, but&mdash;" and the Frenchman gave an expressive
shrug.</p>

<p>"Just as well, perhaps you didn't show yourself; old
Brankstone puts on as much side as the captain of a man-of-war,
ten chances to one the old ass would have shoved you in irons,
and signalled to the first steamer."</p>

<p>"And you?" queried the Frenchman. "If you're starving,
jump in and come aboard, we'll give you a feed, don't
matter to us where you hail from; it looks as though you
have had a devilish had time of it.</p>

<p>"Bad time, my God, no man ever went through such a time and
lived."</p>

<p>He scrambled into the dingy, and they, were soon on board the
lugger, lucre was only one more white man on board, beside the
coloured crew, and he so much resembled the rescuer than it was
not difficult to put them down as brothers: He looked at his
brother and said laconically:</p>

<p>"New Caledonia?"</p>

<p>"Yes," assented the other, "we'll give him a feed and rest,
lie's had a devil of a time, like the rest of them from
there.</p>

<p>"I have money," urged the Frenchman, hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, tommy rot. We don't take money from starving men," said
the man who had I brought him on board, and whose name was Bob
Davidson. "We were just going to have our chow ourselves when you
came along, so sit down."</p>

<p>The escaped convict was soon eating voraciously a warm and
plentiful meal, and that finished, he could not restrain the
longing looks he cast at the pipes the others commenced smoking.
Dick, the other brother, noticed the wistful glances and passed
over a cake of tobacco and a knife.</p>

<p>"Dashed if I think we've got a spare pipe aboard, those
niggers are death on pipes.</p>

<p>"No pipe, thank you, a little paper?" said their guest.</p>

<p>Dick grinned, and handed the Frenchman a piece of a "Cooktown
Herald," from which the other quickly tore a slip, and made
himself a cigarette.</p>

<p>"What is your name?" asked Bob, when this had been
completed.</p>

<p>Their visitor held up his hand imploringly, "Ah, one
moment."</p>

<p>The two well-fed men watched the outcast with an amused smile,
while he silently luxuriated in the unwonted enjoyment of
tobacco; presently he took the rude cigarette from his mouth, and
spoke: "My name my friends, my very kind friends, is Louis
Everard; I was sent to New Caledonia five years ago on the
perjured testimony of a false friend. But, bah, you always hear
that; is it not so?"</p>

<p>"What was the charge?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Embezzlement. I held a position of trust in a bank in Paris,
and I frequently had occasion to go to London on confidential
missions, which is the reason I speak your language."</p>

<p>The men accepted the statement in simple good faith; they were
gifted with more than their share of good nature, and not of
suspicion. Only they were relieved to hear that it was not a
murderer they were succouring.</p>

<p>"What are you thinking of doing?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"I seek to reach Cooktown. I have a friend, a countryman
there."</p>

<p>"Show your face in Cooktown like you are now, and you will be
arrested on suspicion at once. The police there have special
orders to keep a sharp lookout for you chaps. They're not very
sharp, but still! they couldn't miss you."</p>

<p>The man looked downcast. "Will you: help me?" he asked. "I
have a little money."</p>

<p>"On, hang your money. Don't keep harping upon that. If you are
an innocent man, we will do what we can to help you."</p>

<p>Everard sprang to his feet, and held his hand up. "May I be
taken again, and sent back to suffer more than I have suffered
already, if I have not told you the truth. I swear that I am
innocent."</p>

<p>There was a pause. "You didn't come across alone?" said
one.</p>

<p>"I had one companion, but be, poor fellow, died under the
hardship. He lies out there," and he waved his hand towards the
distant Pacific.</p>

<p>The conversation was carried on for some time longer, and then
the men retired to rest, telling Everard that they would work out
some scheme in the morning. In the morning, the two fishers said
nothing until after breakfast, and then they broached the
subject, and it was evident that their unexpected guest had
created a favourable impression.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Bob, "it's no good our lending you any of
our clothes, for we're nothing like a match." Everard was tall
and gaunt, and the brothers were short, sturdy men. "As soon as
you set foot in Cooktown, you would attract notice, and it would
be all up. What we propose doing is this. We are going to our
fishing station on No. 10 Island today. When we get there, Dick
is going to Cooktown, to get some stores, so you can just quietly
stop there at our camp until he gets back. He'll try and find out
your friend, and take him a letter if you'll write to him, and
get you some clothes, and get the friend to change your money,
for I suppose it is French."</p>

<p>"And you will allow me to pay you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a fair price, for we shall hare some trouble to set you
ashore. If you land in broad daylight every prying Custom-house
official and grass-green booby will be cross-questioning us as to
how we came to pick up a fellow like you on the Barrier. No, we
must manage it after dark, and Dick must have a confab with your
friend."</p>

<p>"Where shall I find him?" asked Dick.</p>

<p>Everard coloured slightly. "He is but in a humble
position&mdash;he is working as cook at some hotel, of which I
know not the name."</p>

<p>"There was a Frenchman cooking at the Great Northern, the last
time I was in the town, suppose it's the same."</p>

<p>"Most likely, if it is, he is the brother of the man who
escaped with me and died.. The brother sent him the money to
bribe one of the warders, but we had to start when but half
prepared; that was the cause of our suffering so."</p>

<p>Little more was said, and the lugger was soon standing for the
Great-Barrier and No. 10 island.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">TWO men were seated is a small room in a
Cooktown hotel. One was the late guest of the trepang fishers;
trimmed and well-dressed, he looked a different man to the
famished wanderer of the beach. He had landed, thanks to the
assistance of the brothers, without molestation, and was now
talking to a friend he had mentioned, who was a thickset,
dark-complexioned fellow, evidently of a lower social grade than
the escapee.</p>

<p>"I have told you all about our hurried escape&mdash;for
it was a case of now or never with us, and we went with but scanty
provisions, and but little water, I will now tell you of your
brother's death." Everard paused, and a look of horror shone in
his eyes.</p>

<p>"I murdered him," he said slowly.</p>

<p>The other started to his feet with a gasp. "Are you mad to
come to me and tell me this?" he hissed. "Do you not know how I
have worked and saved for the purpose of gaining my brother's
liberty? Do yon imagine that I would let his murderer go free?
You are mad I say. Your sufferings have driven you crazy; it
cannot be."</p>

<p>"Would to God it was but a dream. Read this." He banded his
companion a piece of paper, and he read:&mdash;</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"Everard will tell you all. It is a case of
necessity; one of us must die to save the other; there is an
equal chance for both. The gamble is quite fair. If it is my fate
to die, give Everard the money you have saved for me. He has
wealthy friends in France who will repay you on his return there.
You will either see me alone, or this paper and Everard."</p>

<br>

<p>The recipient of this message from the dead read it over two
or three times, then got up and walked about the room; the other
watched hint without a word. Presently the brother of the lost
man resumed his seat. "I will hear the rest now," he said.</p>

<p>"We put out to sea," continued Everard, "on one of the most
desperate ventures that ever two men embarked on. Owing to the
incompleteness of our preparations, we had a small boat instead
of the larger craft we had arranged for, and, as I said before,
with but scant provisions and water.</p>

<p>"Fate dogged us from the start. How our cockleshell lived
through the storms that burst upon us I know not; but one day we
found ourselves becalmed upon the bosom of the mighty Pacific,
which still heaved with the past convulsions. We had hardly
sufficient strength to bale the boat dry. Some rags of rail still
clung to the mast, but there was no wind to stir them, and so for
days we drifted on. Oh, it was awful to sit in that boat under
the burning sun, our boat wallowing in the swell, but not one
breath of wind. It seemed that we had but exchanged the horror of
the penal settlement for the horror of such a death; can you
wonder that my season gave way, and that a mad idea entered into
my half dazed brain. A short and quick death seemed preferable, I
said. 'What food we have left may keep life in one until the
Australian coast is reached: but it will not suffice for two. I
am willing to take my chance which of us goes overboard.'</p>

<p>"Your brother lifted his head and gazed I at me. 'You mean,
which of us shall die to save the life of the other.'</p>

<p>"I could see that he misunderstood me, and thought that I
meant to suggest the roost horrible resort. 'God forbid,' I
shudderingly said. 'No, no, we will not live on human flesh. The
man who sacrifices his life goes overboard."</p>

<p>"He shuddered. 'Not overboard. I have a horror of drowning. I
could not do it. Promise to kill me with your own hand if I lose,
and I consent to draw lots.'</p>

<p>"'I have no weapon,' I said weakly.</p>

<p>"Your brother was sitting in the stern. He opened a locker,
and drew out a tomahawk we had. 'A man cannot well kill himself
with this; but in the hands, of another it would be deadly.
Promise to do your share.'</p>

<p>"I hesitated; to jump into the sea was one thing; to sky a
companion in cold blood was another. 'I cannot do it,' I
answered.</p>

<p>"'Then there is no hope for either of us. For I will not
undertake to jump overboard. I have such a detestation, of death
by that means.'</p>

<p>"I pondered. After all, it was much the same thing. 'Well,
then I agree.'</p>

<p>"He held out his hand, and we solemnly swore to stand by our
compact.</p>

<p>"'How shall we decide?' he asked.</p>

<p>"'Let us toss up a coin three times after the English fashion.
Heads or tails as they say.'</p>

<p>"He took out the money that you had sent the warder for us.
'To think,' he said, 'that all this cannot purchase one poor
meal.'</p>

<p>"He selected a coin, and as the ghastly game commenced, it
seemed to me that the restless ocean grew still to watch us
gamble for out lives. Your brother tossed first. He spun the coin
up; caught it, and covered it with his hand.</p>

<p>"'Head!' I cried carelessly, for I cared nothing which way it
went.</p>

<p>"He lifted his hand, and the coin lay with the head uppermost.
I had won the first toss.</p>

<p>"I took the coin and spun it up in my turn. 'Head!' cried your
brother, and it was again a head. We were equal, and I handed the
coin back.</p>

<p>"'Head!' I again called, and for the third time the head was
uppermost, and I had won.</p>

<p>"Your brother smiled. 'I wish to write a few words first.' And
he wrote the words you have there. Then he handed me the
tomahawk, sat down on the after thwart, and bowed his head. 'I am
ready,' he said. Twice I raised the tomahawk, and twice my hand
failed. He lifted his face. 'Do not keep me waiting, remember
your oath, he said,' and bowed his head once more....</p>

<p>"I grasped the weapon; with determination I raised
it&mdash;and threw it far into the sea; my reason had
returned.</p>

<p>"'I cannot do it,' I cried. 'We live or die together.'</p>

<p>"Your brother looked at me reproachfully. 'Is this the way you
keep your oath?' he exclaimed. 'It is cruel to drive me to a
death I detest.'</p>

<p>"Before I could restrain him, he shut his eyes, and sprang
over the side. Instinctively I leant over and watched for him to
rise. Just at that moment a puff of wind arose, and stirred the
ragged sail. I caught hold of the tiller, and then I saw some
bubbles rising on the other side. I had been looking the wrong
way, and the boat had drifted over him."</p>

<p>Everard paused, and his listener got up and took two or three
turns about the room.</p>

<p>"You accuse yourself of murdering him. By what you tell me, it
was suicide."</p>

<p>"I murdered him. I have more to relate."</p>

<p>Everard went on with his tale. "The breeze grew steady, and we
were soon forging ahead through a calm sea. All night, with the
great horror of loneliness on me I kept on with a fair wind
astern, and in the morning, I saw a line of breakers ahead There
was one open passage, and through that I steered. Land rose in
sight. We had been closer to the Queensland coast than we had
imagined. Soon after noon I landed with a meal of food still on
board. But for my mad project, your brother would be sitting here
now."</p>

<p>He ceased, the other man kept gloomily looking down for some
time. At last he spoke. "What proof have you of this improbable
story?"</p>

<p>"You have the message in your brother's handwriting; and I
swear, on my soul, that I have told you the truth."</p>

<p>"Bah. You are clever. A man of education transported for
forgery and embezzlement. What easier than for you to concoct
such a yarn. I don't trust to it. Provisions ran short, of
course, and you killed him to save them for yourself. Yes, killed
a man who was sent to prison for his love of liberty, a political
martyr, who strove for freedom for his fellow workmen. I do not
believe you. Listen; blood must have blood; I will not slay you
with my own hands, but you shall go back to lifelong hell in New
Caledonia. I go now to inform the police of your presence here."
He rose and put on his cap.</p>

<p>"Blood must have blood," repeated Everard calmly; "but I am
guiltless of directly shedding your brother's, though I was
unhappily the cause. I am guiltless too of the charge that sent
me from France a branded felon; as guiltless as he was. Go, then;
bring the police; do not fear that I shall attempt to escape. You
will find me here when you return with them."</p>

<p>The other glanced at him, and hastily quitted the room.
Everard sat still and waited. Nearly half an hour elapsed before
returning footsteps were heard. The avenger entered alone.</p>

<p>"I have changed my mind," he said. "Go in peace, I do not say
that I have overcome my doubts, but I have thought deeply. Keep
the money you have for your own use. If&mdash;as my brother says,
you have wealthy relatives, you can repay me. If not, why&mdash;"
he stopped abruptly and spread out his hands.</p>

<p>"I thank you," replied Everard, gazing at him steadily; "not
for my life, for that is now worthless to me, but for the chance
it leaves me of revenge on the man whose perjury sent me to
prison. And I will avenge your brother, for the same man betrayed
him. I will come to him like a ghost from his villainous past,
that he thought laid for ever. Is not his name&mdash;" and he
whispered in the other's ear.</p>

<p>"By God, it <i>is</i> the man; you have told me the truth, and
I believe now in all you have told me."</p>

<p>He held out both hands, which Everard took.</p>

<p>"Go," he continued, "and when you confront that Judas, then,
when you strike, remember you are avenging both my brother's
death, and your own betrayal."</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>7. &mdash; THE HAUNTED STEAMER</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 14 Dec 1901</h3>

<p class="first">"NOW you fellows speak of it," said the chief
engineer of the S.S. <i>Mainbrace</i>, as he sat on his bunk,
with his legs dangling over the side, addressing two passengers
who had already been made free of his state, room, "the ship has
been haunted ever since Jack Collins went overboard, Just twelve
months ago. Naturally, we don't talk about it, but the passengers
generally find it out sooner or later. We are used to him, and
don't mind him."</p>

<p>"He was sitting on the transom in the saloon last night," said
the passenger for China, who occupied the camp stool. "I fell
asleep on deck, and did not wake till everybody had turned in,
and when I went below I saw him there. I thought be looked like a
stranger, but before I could fix him properly he was gone."</p>

<p>"He was on the after hatch a night or two ago," said the
pearl-sheller, who was on the settee. "I went up, meaning to
speak to him, but when I got close it was the shadow of the wind
sail. They play these tricks. There was a schooner up in the
Straits troubled the same way."</p>

<p>"How did it happen? There's only the two of us here, and we're
not talking men."</p>

<p>"He was our second officer," began the chief, "and a bright
young fellow, too, just going up for his master's certificate
when he reached Sydney, about a month before last Christmas. He
never went up, however. When he got home he found that his wife
had cleared out with someone else. Who it was she went with he
did not know, and nobody else seemed to know; but she was gone
right enough. I think, between ourselves, that not knowing who
the man was preyed on him more than anything. If he could have
got hold of the pair of them, and could have taken it out of the
man and told the hussy a bit of his mind, I don't think he would
have felt it as bad as he did; but, as it was, he could do
nothing, and the idea of going through life not knowing but at
any time he might unknowingly meet him, make friends with him,
and eat and drink with him&mdash;why he told me himself that it
was driving him crazy. It was on Christmas Eve that it happened.
I suppose the thought of his last Christmas, when he was ashore
and just married, was too much for him. Anyhow, he must have gone
over the side as soon as he went off watch. He gave the man who
relieved him the course, chatted a bit, as usual, then went down
off the bridge, and nobody saw him again. It might have been an
accident, for it was a dark night, and there was a heavy sea
running."</p>

<p>"I expect he knows now who the other fellow was," said the
sheller.</p>

<p>"Did the other fellow know him?" asked the China
passenger.</p>

<p>"Possibly not. Queer arrangement, eh? However, they won't meet
in this world. Poor Collins made sure of that," said the chief.
"Last trip he was often up on the bridge they told me, but this
trip he seems to be sticking aft. I have not seen him looking
down the skylight into the engine-room, as he used to. Keep it
quiet, though; some people are nervous, and don't like this sort
of thing."</p>

<p>The curtain hanging in front of the doorway was drawn on one
side, and a face looked in. The three men started, but it was not
the face of the man who "walked."</p>

<p>"You look comfortable," said the owner of the face. "Can I
come in?"</p>

<p>"Come in," said the chief, and the sheller shifted a little on
the settee to make room for the newcomer.</p>

<p>It was another of the passengers&mdash;a man with a fair beard
and rather large, light blue eyes. He accepted the accommodation
with a nod of thanks, sat down, took out his cigar case, and
offered the engineer a cigar&mdash;both the other men were
smoking already. The subject of conversation changed at once. The
engineer gradually glided into the inevitable yarn, and when it
was finished the China passenger and the pearl sheller said good
night, and left the cabin. A riding light was swinging about
midway between the officers' state rooms amidships and the saloon
companionway. As they approached it, another man could be seen
coming along the deck, going forward. They should have met just
under the swinging lantern, but as they approached the circle of
light, the figure faded out of sight.</p>

<p>"Collins," said one with a gasp, and clutched the other's
arm.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the man addressed, "I suppose we shall get used
to it in time," and he gave a forced laugh.</p>

<p>They halted at the companion way, and looked back. A bar of
light flashed for a moment across the alleyway amidships&mdash;it
was the third man leaving the engineer's cabin, he could be seen
coming along the deck.</p>

<p>"There's Collins again, standing by the skylight of the
engine-room," said the pearl-sheller, whose name was
Reynolds.</p>

<p>"Looks as though he was waiting for that fellow. Do you know
him?" returned the other.</p>

<p>"No: he's been sea-sick, I think; only just shown up since
we've been steady."</p>

<p>The third passenger came on. They could see the burning end of
his cigar, and when he came in the beam of light he stopped and
tossed the stump overboard; then, as he turned, he became
conscious of the figure standing at the skylight, apparently
watching him. For a moment they stood, the dumb ghost and the
unconscious mortal, looking at each other, then the man came
on.</p>

<p>"Who's that sulky beggar standing by the skylight?" he said,
when he reached the others. "Said good-night to him, and he
wouldn't answer me."</p>

<p>"His name's Collins; he's a remarkably quiet man," said the
China passenger.</p>

<p>"Seems like it," said the other. "Wonder if the bar is still
open. Have a nightcap, you chaps?"</p>

<p>"Not for me," said Reynolds.</p>

<p>"Nor me, either," replied Gibson, the China passenger.</p>

<p>"Well, it's a hot night, so I'll get the steward to mix me the
namesake of our friend, a 'John Collins.' Wonder if his name is
John? I knew a Mrs. Collins once," and with a vacant chuckle he
descended the few steps that led into the saloon.</p>

<p>"Seems a bit of an ass. What do you think?"</p>

<p>"I think we ought to put the ghost in irons. I shouldn't
wonder if this is the man it's looking for: I suppose you didn't
do it?"</p>

<p>"Not quite. I've got a very good little wife of my own; but
I'd rather have the ghost after me than her if I did such a
thing."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall turn in now. I suppose our friend has finished
his drink by this time," and they went to their respective
berths.</p>

<p>"Steward," said the fair-bearded passenger to the chief
steward the next morning, "somebody kept disturbing me last night
by looking in my cabin. If it was one of your boys, I wish you'd
tell him to stop poking his head in at my door."</p>

<p>The steward made a suitable reply, but watched the other as he
ascended to the deck. "Somebody looking in his cabin," he
repeated. "Seem to me I have heard tales of that sort
before."</p>

<p>It was fine weather, of the hot variety to be expected in the
tropics, and was bright and clear, and for once nobody had
anything to growl about, and Christmas warn rapidly approaching.
The fair-bearded, passenger alone seemed unsettled in mind, now
over-cheerful, and then despondent; his name was Vincent, and
though some got on with him well enough, neither Reynolds nor
Gibson liked him.</p>

<p>"Collins is very restless," said the latter one day to his
friend. "Kept doing sentry-go on the after deck last night.
Vincent was asleep in a chair, and suddenly woke up in a fright,
and staggered over to the railing. I collared hold of him, and
roused him up, and he said he'd had an awful dream. Dreamt he was
in the sea on a dark night, fighting for his life, and watching
the lights of the steamer disappearing. I told him he was taking
too much whisky, but he went below and got another nip. Then
Collins laughed."</p>

<p>"Here, drop that, old man; ghosts don't laugh, at least the
ghosts that I know don't."</p>

<p>"Well, anyway there was a laugh, a very nasty laugh, somewhere
about, and I had to visit the steward myself."</p>

<p><br>
THE next morning the steamer anchored at Rock Harbor for a few
hours.</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Vincent?" said the Customs officer when he
came on board. "Better for your trip?"</p>

<p>"Oh much, thank you; quite right now; naturally upset, you
know."</p>

<p>"Know that man?" asked Reynolds when the Customs official had
finished his conversation with the other.</p>

<p>"Slightly. He was up here with his wife about six months ago,
on his way to England in a B. and A. boat, and a sad thing
happened. They were overheard having a rather heated argument in
their cabin, and then she rushed on deck, and, it is supposed,
jumped overboard. She was never seen again. He was dreadfully cut
up, and at Donnor's Island changed steamers, and went back again
south."</p>

<p>"Where did this happen?"</p>

<p>"About halfway between here and Donner's Island. I must be
off. There's the donkey engine starting, and I don't want to be
carried on. Good-bye. Remember me to all up north."</p>

<p>About two o'clock the next morning those who slept below were
roused by hot words. Mr. Vincent and the chief steward were
nearly coming to blows in the saloon.</p>

<p>"I tell you the fellow came right into my cabin, and was
bending over me when I woke up. It's an infernal shame that you
can't manage your men better, and that passengers should be
annoyed like that."</p>

<p>"It's all fancy. My men are much too tired at night, and want,
to sleep, not go monkeying about looking in people's cabins. None
of the other passengers have been annoyed."</p>

<p>Vincent turned to Reynolds, who had been roused by the
discussion.</p>

<p>"I was dreaming that confounded dream again, and I woke up in
a fright, and there was somebody in my cabin bending over my
berth. I assure you there was."</p>

<p>The steward looked at Reynolds over Vincent's shoulder, and
made the motion of drinking with his hand, and Reynolds persuaded
him to go to bed again. It was blowing hard the next morning, and
an unseasonable change had taken place, a reminder of the coming
monsoons. The sea was getting, up, and it looked as though a
stormy Christmas would set in the next day. There had been a
small jollification, it being Christmas Eve, and Vincent, who had
recovered his spirits, had been exceedingly light-hearted and
jovial, and bad turned in early rather the worse for wear. It was
eleven o'clock, and the chief engineer and the two passengers
were taking a walk up and down the short poop deck; the ship was
uncomfortably restless, and they stopped, and sat down for more
ease.</p>

<p>"Who is that coming up?" asked Reynolds.</p>

<p>"Somebody in pyjamas, a woman and another man. Why, it's
Vincent." And the three men rose.</p>

<p>The steamer gave a heavy roll and a dive just then, and the
three figures passed aft on the opposite side of the deck as the
ship took a big beam sea on board. Down she went, the screw
racing like mad, and the three figures could be seen right aft;
but when she straightened up again they were gone. The engineer
took about three steps down on to the deck and into the saloon,
and the other two made their way aft. They looked over at the
bubbling wake illuminated by the light from the stern portholes,
but if any man's head had been above water it would not have been
seen in that seething turmoil. The alarm was given, and the usual
routine gone through, as a matter of form, for there was no
earthly hope of ever seeing the man again, and the steamer, after
much delay, resumed her passage with the loss of a lifebuoy and a
passenger.</p>

<p>When the chief hurried into the saloon he went straight to
Vincent's cabin, and found it empty, and the steward told him
that Mr. Vincent had just gone on deck.</p>

<p>"Was he alone, and in his pyjamas?"</p>

<p>"Yes," returned the steward to both questions. The chief went
on to the deck again, now crowded and busy, and drew the two men
aside.</p>

<p>"There were a man and a woman with Vincent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," they both affirmed; "they had seen the three figures
distinctly."</p>

<p>"I don't think we'll say anything about them," said the chief.
"I wonder whether Vincent saw them, too?"</p>

<p>"Poor devil," said Reynolds. "Dreamt he was in a big sea on a
dark night fighting for his life, and watching the lights of the
steamer disappearing."</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>8. &mdash; THE MYSTERY OF THE DEATH STROKE</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 14 Dec 1904</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">IT was raining, and the hearts of men and beasts
rejoiced. Raining! Not a few tantalising heat-drops, but a steady
downpour, out of a leaden sky; a downpour that drummed with a
grateful throbbing on rooftops, and trilled with a musical drip,
drip, from the downcast leaves still remaining on the non-edible
trees that the axe had left untouched. Water! Surface water, a
thing men had forgotten the appearance of, was beginning to stand
in pools on the flats; and, beyond, the river foliage was blurred
and misty...</p>

<p>But on Greenbank Station there was no rejoicing. The rain, the
longed-for rain, had been withheld too long, and now its mournful
splashings seemed to the ear of the listener to weave themselves
into that bitter refrain, "Too late! Too late!"</p>

<p>Years of the hardest work that can fall to the lot of man.
Thankless work, under a blistering sun, and a cloudless sky.
Amidst the piteous moaning of tortured, dying stock, all, all, in
vain. That day a representative of the mortgagees would arrive to
take over the lonely homestead, and a stockless run. Plenty and
prosperity would reign once more, as good season succeeded good
season, to benefit those who had never borne the heat and burden
of the day.</p>

<p>So thought Dick Drummond, as he sat on the verandah and
moodily watched the rainfall, and he envied that stout old
pioneer, his father, who two months ago had been laid to take his
last rest in the hard, baked ground. But there had been worse
behind. The mystery of a sudden, violent, and unexplained
death.</p>

<p>Obstinate, hot-tempered, open-handed, and honourable, old Dick
Drummond, senior, was riding home from the township of Wyagong,
and when half-way a mysterious hand had stricken him down. A
small gashed wound on the head, how inflicted they could not
tell, had tumbled him off his horse on to the dry, dusty road,
where he had lain until the horse himself, with trailing bridle,
had taken home a wordless message that something was wrong. It
was young Dick and one of his men who rode back hotfoot, and
found the body of the old man. With a bushman's instinct, he had
searched for tracks the first thing, and found no trace.</p>

<p>The single horse track going into Wyagong, the single horse
track coming back. The mark where the body had fallen heavily and
inertly, without a struggle, was all that the dry, dusty road had
to tell. Dry and dusty with the long drought. The fall, in a fit,
to the ground, could not have killed him, for there were no
stones in the neighbourhood to cause tho wound; nor had it been
inflicted by the horse's foot. Dick, junior, carefully kept the
ground as clear as possible from confusing tracks around the
scene of the tragedy, but it availed not.</p>

<p>The local tracking talent&mdash;and it was good&mdash;could
make nothing of it; black, white, and brown wore alike puzzled.
The wound on the head was sharp and clean, made by no blunt
instrument; but where was the instrument? And how had it vanished
without leaving any trace but the wound, so mysteriously
inflicted?</p>

<p>A man was arrested on suspicion; a man who had a grudge of two
years' standing against old Drummond. Two years ago there had
been some shearing troubles, and this man, Blacklock, had made
himself particularly active. But he overstepped the mark on one
occasion, and laid himself open to arrest. It was a matter of
identity, and it rested with Drummond. Drummond, obstinate as a
mule, when it was, as he thought, a question of right or wrong,
swore to his identity, and Blacklock got a severe sentence of
twelve months. When he came out, he openly vowed he'd got even
with Drummond, and when the old man was killed suspicion fell
upon him.</p>

<p>But nothing came of it, for there was no evidence to send him
to trial. Moreover, the electoral district of Wantaplace was on
the eve of an election, and Blacklock was an influential agent on
the side of Octavius C. Drummond, the popular candidate. Octavius
was a distant relative of Drummond of Greenbank, but there was
enmity, deep and bitter, between them; and when suspicion fell on
Blacklock, at the time of the murder, Octavius swore that at that
very time Blacklock was with him at Murtagh's Crossing, fifty
miles away. So the weak case fell through at once, and soon
afterwards, thanks to the energetic canvassing of Mr. Blacklock,
who was a popular man among many of the electors, Octavius C.
Drummond became M.L.A. for Wantaplace. And, as if in recognition
of the glorious fact, the eight years' drought soon afterwards
broke up.</p>

<p>A cold nose of sympathy was thrust into young Drummond's
listless hand, as he sat dreaming of the past, and an old Irish
terrier put his forepaws on his knee, and, with an uneasy
whimper, looked wistfully at him, with yearning, brown eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor old Barney," said Dick, as he patted the rough head. "I
hope the fellow who's coming is a decent fellow, who's fond of
doggies."</p>

<p>Barney suddenly jumped down, and ran to the edge of the
verandah, giving a short bark. Dick looked up, and saw a buggy
just pulling up at the stable. One of the two occupants got out,
and approached the house, and Barney jumped off the verandah, and
ran to greet him. Drummond followed with a surprised look on his
face.</p>

<p>"You, Grant? I expected someone very different," he said, as
he shook the newcomer's hand, and they re-entered the
verandah.</p>

<p>"The villain, eh? The usurping villain of a dastardly bailiff,
who was going to turn you out homeless on a cruel world! Well,
here he is. I am the representative of McWhirt and McWhirt; come
to demand the pound of flesh and as much blood as the drought has
left you. It's hard lines, Dick," he went on in a different tone,
"to see all this rain come when it won't benefit you."</p>

<p>"It's just the fortune of war, old man. But tell me what
brings you up here?"</p>

<p>Grant swished the water out of his sopping hat, and tossing it
and his waterproof on one of the canvas chairs, followed his
friend inside.</p>

<p>"You must know," said Grant, first helping himself to a little
whisky, which stimulant Drummond had thoughtfully placed on the
table. "I have been working some time for McWhirt, and McWhirt,
buying fats and droving, and when I got down to Sydney a week ago
I received Instructions to come up here and take delivery of
Greenbank I hesitated. I know of the old man's death, and,
somehow I didn't feel like it. But, on second thoughts, I changed
my mind. If I don't go somebody else will; and Dick would rather
I stood in his shoes than anyone else," and he stopped and patted
Barney as if to emphasise the remark.</p>

<p>"Just like you, Grant," replied Drummond, "but you don't find
much to take delivery of. Death has done that already."</p>

<p>The two friends said nothing for a time. Then Dick jumped up,
and said, "I've had a stroke of luck. When this place was
mortgaged there were two allotments of mine and Charley's in
Wyagong that were not included. All through the drought no one
would have given a brass farthing for them. Now, however, since
the rain, land is booming again. Why, I don't know. Anyhow, I was
offered six hundred for the two, and, you bet, I closed. It will
give me a start in another State, and be a windfall for
Charley."</p>

<p>"How's Charley getting on?"</p>

<p>"As well as a young beginner in an overcrowded profession can
expect to got on!"</p>

<p>"And what do you think of doing?"</p>

<p>"Well, I've a fancy for West Australia. I've an idea that Mr.
Blacklock's gone there."</p>

<p>Grant looked grave. "Still hold to that idea. How's
Octavius?"</p>

<p>"We don't correspond, but I believe he is now a shining
political light."</p>

<p>"Well, may this windfall prove a good omen; I shall see you
back here yet."</p>

<p>"To toll you the truth, I'm glad to get away. I shan't be
myself until I know the truth about the governor's death."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">THREE or four days afterwards Dick was in
Sydney. As he predicted, the delivery did not take long. Dick
stood on the doorstep of a small house, and contemplated an array
of small medical doorplates.</p>

<p>"Seem all to hang together, to give each other courage," he
mused as he rang the bell, and inquired for Dr. Drummond. After
satisfying the doormaid that he had had the audacity to call
without an appointment, she took his name up, and the next minute
he was being welcomed by his brother. After the first greetings
were over, Dick asked how the medical profession was getting
on?</p>

<p>"Where are you off to Dick?" asked Charley, suddenly, in
reply.</p>

<p>"West Australia, to do a little prospecting."</p>

<p>"Then I'm off, too, for there's too many doctors in Sydney
just at present."</p>

<p>"And how about Jim?"</p>

<p>"Poor Jim; we might as well wait for each other at the two
ends of the Continent as in two Sydney suburbs. Octavius has got
the last of her little money out of her. Cuss him."</p>

<p>"Cuss him, say I; but you'll not come with me, Charley. I've
got some good news for you."</p>

<p>"You're going to be very ill, Dick; never mind. I'll doctor
you for nothing."</p>

<p>"Listen. I had a bid for those two allotments in Wyagong, and
I've sold them for six hundred."</p>

<p>"Is the sky going to fall?"</p>

<p>"One hundred and fifty will do me for outfit, I think; you and
Jim can manage a beginning on the balance. I don't know how much
it wants to start a doctor on a career of slaughter."</p>

<p>"Got any of the money about you?" said Charley,
irrelevantly.</p>

<p>"A pound or two."</p>

<p>"Then let's go and have a decent lunch before the vision
vanishes."</p>

<p>During the meal Charley's tongue still kept wagging, though
Dick failed to rouse himself to the occasion, but he listened
attentively to his brother's chatter.</p>

<p>"Octavius has wheedled his old mother out of everything, and
even, as I told you, got poor Jemima's little bit. The old
woman's doting, and bedridden, and Jim has to look after her.
Octavius pays the rent of a small cottage, and allows them a
pound a week, and Jim has to eke it out typewriting, etc. We'll
go out after lunch, and talk this windfall over. Jim's got a
splendid business head, and, please the pigs, we'll make a
start."</p>

<p>A short tram journey and a walk brought the brothers to where
Jemima, the younger sister of the member for Wantaplace, resided
with her mother. Her welcome to Dick was cordial in the extreme,
and she entered into the discussion of business details with
animation, and they soon had the small capital planned out in a
satisfactory manner.</p>

<p>"But, Dick," said Jemima, "you're quite sure the one-fifty
will get you all you want?"</p>

<p>"Quite, and if you don't make use of the balance,
I'll&mdash;I'll lend it to Octavius."</p>

<p>"Been here lately?" asked Charley.</p>

<p>"Yes. He came to get me to alter his last new frock coat. He
goes to a cheap tailor, and he's not a good fit. He's good enough
to say that I am cleverer than any tailor, but then he has to pay
the tailor, and he does not offer to pay me, although the last
job took more than half a day."</p>

<p>"Poor old Jim," said Charley.</p>

<p>"Oh! He's a brother to be proud of. He's bidding for the
women's vote, and addresses meetings on the subject of underpaid
women's work. He owes me £25 for typewriting, and I'll go to one
of his meetings and read the item out one day."</p>

<p>"Well, no more typewriting, Jim, remember you're going to be a
doctor's wife now, and the member for Wantaplace must pay
somebody to do his work."</p>

<p>"Not he," said Jemima; "he'll run up a bill with some poor
struggling typist, and pay in promises like he always does."</p>

<p>"Our distant relation seems to inspire esteem and affection in
private life," said Dick, as they walked home.</p>

<p>"He's a skunk; but you'd be astonished at the moral political
reputation he's building up. Lord! to hear him speak you would
think he was fairly bubbling over with benevolence."</p>

<p>"Well, if I can verify my suspicions, I'll damage his bubbling
reputation," returned Dick, savagely.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">INLAND West Australia is looking at its worst.
Round the gold field districts the perennial dry weather common
to the locality has reduced the country to its usual wilted
condition. A group of mixed men, camels, and horses are scattered
about the ground surrounding a bit of a tin humpy and a few
dilapidated shanties. There is a little saltbush scattered
around, some very tired-looking scrub, and a bare granite mound
of rock. There has been a bit of soak here; and a speculative
individual has started a shanty; but the soak is at its last,
gasp, and the next morning will see the end of it as a halting
place. Dick and a couple of mates have stopped there to water
their few camels. To them comes a man leading a limping pony.</p>

<p>"Look here," he says in an aggrieved tone, "what that blooming
looney did yesterday. Chipped my prad on the hip skylarking about
with the niggers. I didn't see it till just now."</p>

<p>"Who was he?"</p>

<p>"Some escaped lunatic been here on the spree. Had too much of
the stuff they distil with the condensers. One of the combos
chopped out a boomerang, and was doing tho saltbush dodge, just
making it skim over the tops without touching, when this cove
reels up."</p>

<p>"'I'll show you how to throw a boomerang or anything else.
Stand, up, Billy, and hold this bottle!' But Billy took to his
heels; so he stuck the bottle up on a stump. My word! the drunker
he got the better he could throw. There's a whole heap of bottles
busted out there. Some of them blooming camels will be cutting
their pads with them."</p>

<p>"Wilde's this genius now'!"</p>

<p>"Went off in the horrors this morning with somebody else's
bike. Owner's after him; might find his body."</p>

<p>"Do you know him?"</p>

<p>"Not from a crow. Came here two or three days ago, mad as a
hatter, going east to smash up somebody who owed him some money.
Topped up here with that distilled stuff; but, my word! he could
throw a boomerang!"</p>

<p>Dick and his mates went to inspect the pony of the talkative
man. Drummond started when he saw the wound, which was not much
to look at.</p>

<p>"You are sure this was made by a boomerang?"</p>

<p>"Yes, the niggers told me he was fooling around at long
distance shots after he'd broken the bottles, and one went
amongst the horses. You see, it's just been whizzing round, and
one end has hit the prad, and the thing has whizzed off again.
'Tain't much if I can keep the flies off, but if it had hit a man
on the nut it would have cooked him."</p>

<p>Dick stared at the speaker in silence. It was just such a
wound was on tho head of his father when he found him. And this
man, this lunatic, who could throw blacks' weapons like few other
men, was Blacklock; had he not a reputation for it all over the
district? No wonder there were no tracks, for they had not looked
far enough back from the road. And Octavius knew all about it,
and bad perjured himself over the alibi. Blacklock was his
right-hand man. If he had been committed to take his trial,
Octavius would have lost the election. And now! He had promised
Blacklock money, and had broken his word. And Blacklock, always
an excitable, queer fellow, had been drinking himself
half-mad.</p>

<p>"We must find this fellow. I have a score to settle with him,"
he said to his mates.</p>

<p>"Here's the bicycle man coming back with his machine," said
the owner of the pony.</p>

<p>The man was wheeling his bike as though it had been
damaged.</p>

<p>"Where did you find it?" inquired one, as he approached.</p>

<p>"'Bout live miles away; he ran against a tree, but it's not
much hurt. I can fix it," returned the express-rider.</p>

<p>"Where's the lunatic?"</p>

<p>"Didn't stop to look for him; I've got to make time, you bet;
somebody else can go."</p>

<p>"All right," said Dick, "just direct me to where you found
your bike, while you tinker it up; my mates and I will start with
one of the niggers."</p>

<p>"You can't go wrong," said the rider, as he fell to work.
"Straight in the direction I come in you'll come on a bit of a
clear slope, from the highest part you'll see a low ridge. At the
western end of it I got my bike, and you'll see my trucks turning
back, his go straight on. He's got a bottle with him. I saw where
he got off to have a swig."</p>

<p>It still wanted two hours to sundown when Dick, his mates, and
a blackfellow started, and in an hour had come to the place where
the express rider had recovered his borrowed machine.</p>

<p>After that they managed to trace a mile or two of erratic
progress before dark, when they camped.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night Dick woke from an uneasy sleep. He
listened intently leaning on his elbow, for he had an indefinable
feeling that somebody was moving about. He could hear the camels
grunting, and the heavy breathing of the blackboy, and was about
to lie down again, when there was a mad laugh close at hand, and
an empty bottle whizzed over his head, and smashed against a
neighbouring tree. Before his mates were fully awake, the lunatic
was in the camp.</p>

<p>The blackboy jumped up in a fright, and, with unerring
instinct, ran straight back to the soak. After a hard struggle,
Dick and the others succeeded in overpowering and securing the
madman.</p>

<p>Towards morning he was exhausted and quiet, and they managed,
with much difficulty, to pack him on a camel, and take him to
some rock holes they knew of. It was no good going back to the
soak, there would be nobody there.</p>

<p>It was Blacklock whom they had rescued, but it was many days
before a gleam of intellect came to the brain shattered with
moody fits of brooding, sullen temper, aggravated by the
poisonous home-brewed spirit.</p>

<p>Sense returned at last, returned with the weakness and
indifference of approaching death. It was only the recognition of
Drummond that woke him into fuller life.</p>

<p>"I never meant to kill the old man," he croaked out. "It
astonished me when I hit him and toppled him over. The boomerang
went on a good distance, and I crossed the road a long way down,
at a place where you could not pick up my track, and recovered
the boomerang. But that skinflint! I pulled him through the
election, and he swore hard and fast in return, that I was at
Murtagh's Crossing, when a score of people knew I was at Wyagong.
Then I cleared out, and he promised to send me money, which he
never did, and what with that and thinking about the old man, I
got on this howling bust; and now I'm done for."</p>

<p>Dick could not deny it.</p>

<p>"Would it do any good if my confession was sworn to. And I
could tell you all about that perjury. Why the publican at
Murtagh's Crossing kept out of the way; 'cause he knew I wasn't
there."</p>

<p>"My mate Mitten is a J.P. I think we'll take your deposition
down, and I'll settle with Octavius."</p>

<p>"Do. He's an awful sneak. He knew I couldn't go back, and he
thought he'd got me, but it's not all over yet."</p>

<p>Blacklock's racked out body soon found peace. To the last he
assured Dick that he never intended the old man's death, but that
the devil got in him, and he couldn't resist the opportunity to
fetch the old squatter down in the dust.</p>

<p>Fortune often repents, and comes with both hands full. While
nursing Blacklock through his last hours, Mitten, who had little
to do, dropped on one of the best shows of that district, and
Dick went back to the east with the prospect of a fortune not far
ahead.</p>

<p>Charley and Jemima were married before he returned, and
Charley's practice was looking up, and Jim did no more
typewriting. Octavius was blooming and basking in the smiles of
political popularity, oozing good works out of every port, when,
to the astonishment of his admirers and followers, he resigned
his seat and left Australia. Nobody knew the reason but three
people, and nobody knew where he went to; but it was reported
that he had become the leader of a new religious sect in the
United States.</p>

<p>Greenbanks was still on the market and Dick invested in it,
and the delighted Barney bit his old friend Grant out of joy at
his return.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>9. &mdash; AN UNWILLING PIRATE</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 19 Oct 1901</h3>

<p class="first">IT was in 1770 that my uncle, who had been
knocking about the sea all his life, came home to Devon with his
pockets heavy with cash. He had strange tales to tell of his late
travels&mdash;he had been absent some three years&mdash;and of
the strange countries in the east, and of his adventures there,
and tales that fired my imagination, for I had been two cruises
with him, and would have much liked to go another, but my father
was ailing, and business compelled me to stop at home. Folks
whispered that my uncle was nothing more nor less than a pirate
when he got south of the Line, and a slaver to boot, but when I
went with him he did nothing but honest trading, and, although he
carried guns, and we twice had trouble with Dutch ships, in which
one of them was sunk, that was brought on by their own
interfering ways.</p>

<p>Well my uncle had been to the Great Southland that the Dutch
had found a long time ago, and that our own navigator, Captain
Dampier, had visited nearly a century before, and what he had
found there he would not state plainly, but whatever it was he
intended to go back there again.</p>

<p>I longed to accompany him, and chance willed that my father
got better, and I was able to leave. We were to sail from
Portsmouth, but were delayed two or three days waiting for a
friend of my uncle's, who was to accompany us.</p>

<p>He came off late one night, and we immediately got under way,
and by daylight were out of sight of land, laying a southern
course before a fair wind.</p>

<p>There was something strange about our mode of departure, and
when I saw our new shipmate in the morning I did not at all like
the cut of his jib. My uncle introduced him to me as Lieutenant
Dalgleish, late king's officer. I think we took a nautical
dislike to each other from the first, and my uncle noticed it,
for he took occasion to tell me to mend my manners towards
Dalgleish, for, said he, "I am under great obligations to him,
which this trip will pay off."</p>

<p>The Object of our trip I had not yet learned. I only knew that
we were bound to the Great Southland, and that my uncle expected
this to be his last voyage. It was, Heaven rest his soul, but not
in the way he hoped for.</p>

<p>We were lucky in the weather, and made good progress, and,
despite my dislike to Mr. Dalgleish, I had to confess that he
knew his business, and could navigate a ship well. We had a good
crew of old salts, better than most ships were manned with, and
our provisions were on a liberal scale, so that our time passed
pleasantly enough till we reached the Cape of Good Hope, and took
in fresh water and stores.</p>

<p>As we drew near the north-west portion of the Southland, which
the Dutch call New Holland, my uncle and Dalgleish pored over the
old Dutch maps of this <i>terra incognita</i>, and compared them
with a rough chart of my uncle's. At last, we sighted land, a
low, barren coast, to which we gave a wide berth, and changed our
course to a more northerly one. We kept on for some days, and
finally got to a portion of the coast where it was studied with
groups of islands.</p>

<p>Amongst these we cruised for some time, having no apparent
object in view but to kill time. At last, one day, just before
noon, we sighted a fleet of proas, and bore down to them. There
must have been between fifty and sixty of them, and my uncle and
Dalgleish went on board the leading proa, and the Rajah
commanding the fleet came back on board the <i>Mermaid</i>, as
our vessel was called. My uncle seemed able to converse with him
in some sort of a lingo I could not make head or tail of, but I
know that the old fellow, in spite of being a Mahomedan, got very
merry on the wine before he went on board his proa.</p>

<p>We now sailed west, and came across another fleet of proas,
where the same scene was reacted, and we then turned southward,
into what I have since found out from Captain Flinders's charts
was a great gulf. We cruised slowly round this great indentation,
though what good we did by it I knew not at the time, though I do
now. To all my questions my uncle would only smile, and say, "We
are waiting till the fish are ready to be caught, my boy."</p>

<p>Dalgleish had seemingly great influence over my uncle, but he
never interfered much with the actual working of the ship, which
was fortunate, for our crew, an honest lot of sea dogs, disliked
both him and his "king's officer" style as much as I did.</p>

<p>One day we put off for the shore to see if we could find a
supply of fresh water, for my uncle had an old Dutch chart, with
"Fresh water" marked on it in one or two places. Dalgleish and I
went with the boat, and found the water. We were not short of
water at the time, but my uncle wished to identify the spot for
future guidance.</p>

<p>We pulled up the entrance to a river fringed with mangroves on
each side, and found the water in a large lagoon, encircled with
tall trees, with weeping foliage and thick papery bark. We saw
many tracks and old fires of the Indians, but did not see any of
them about the lagoon. Going back we ran on to a mudbank, and the
boatswain jumped out to push the boat off. Immediately there came
a shower of spears from amongst the mangroves, which, fortunately
did no harm.</p>

<p>"Give way, quick!" shouted Dalgleish, jumping up and firing
off his pistol. The men were bending to their oars, for the boat
was now afloat, and the boatswain would have been left behind but
that I dropped the tiller, and seizing an oar, swung the stern of
the boat round and helped the man in.</p>

<p>"You should see that all your crew are on board before you
shove off. Mr. Dalgleish," I said.</p>

<p>"Yes," added the boatswain. "Is that how they do on a King's
ship&mdash;leave a man in a mudhole to be speared to death by the
Indians?"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash; your insolence," said Dalgleish. "You should
have got on board smarter; and as for you, Master Ruthven, I'd
advise you not to shove your oar in."</p>

<p>"I'll shove my oar in when I see occasion, in spite of any
cashiered King's officer," I retorted, and I saw him give a start
and dart a fiendish glance at me, which confirmed my suspicions
that he had been dismissed the navy in disgrace. However, he said
nothing at the time, but when I got on board, my uncle, joined by
Dalgleish, rated me soundly for my behavior. I had made a bitter
enemy, but I had also made a firm friend, for the sturdy old
boatswain was henceforth devoted to me.</p>

<p>After cruising aimlessly about for some time longer we
returned to the watering place, sent an armed party ashore, and
filled our casks, this time without any molestation. We then
sailed north and west, and amongst some islands came across a
large fleet of proas. All the crew were mustered up, and my uncle
made a speech to them in which to my intense astonishment he said
that he held a privateer's commission to harass and plunder all
the king's enemies, and that Lieutenant Dalgleish would read it
to them, which the latter, dressed in full uniform, proceeded to
do. He then went on to explain that a state of war existed
between the King of England and Sultan of Macassar, and it was
their duty to overhaul these proas by force if necessary, and
take what valuable they had, there would be good prize money all
round. He then called for three cheers for King George, and my
uncle ordered the decks to be cleared for action, and the guns
shotted.</p>

<p>Now this yarn was good enough for the sailors, who were tired
of inaction, and believed what was said, but it certainly did not
deceive me. The whole piratical scheme flashed across me at
once.</p>

<p>During our friendly intercourse with the Malays my uncle had
learned their movements when the pearl fishery, which they were
engaged in, would come to an end, and all the plans had been laid
accordingly, and we had cruised about in the great gulf until the
time was ripe.</p>

<p>As for the commission, I no more believed in that than I did
in Dalgleish himself. I drew my uncle on one side, and told him
what I thought of the affair, and refused to take part in it. He
flew into a great rage, swore the commission was genuine, and
calling Dalgleish over commenced a tirade against me, which I did
not reply to, but when Dalgleish sneeringly remarked something I
rounded on him, and plainly told him that he was a coward, and
had shown the white feather when the Indians attacked us. He
talked mighty big, but dared do no more, for he was no match for
me if it came to blows.</p>

<p>Our near approach to the proas cut short the altercation, and
bidding me hastily go and skulk below, my uncle went on the poop
deck, followed by Dalgleish. I leant over the side and watched
proceedings. The thing was managed well. My uncle knew the ways
of the Malays, and fired a shot across the bows of the proa which
carried the Rajah of the fleet. An armed boat's crew then went on
board, while we lay close to, with the guns trained on the
proa.</p>

<p>There was no resistance, and the marauders returned with their
plunder. As the pearls obtained were regularly brought on board
the Rajah's proa, it was not worth while overhauling the
remainder of the fleet, and we made sail for the next
rendezvous.</p>

<p>How the old Rajah took the transformation of his quondam hosts
into pirates I do not know, but I suppose it astonished him. Of
course the two did not confide in me as to the amount of their
plunder, but I guessed, from their manner, it was valuable. I
could not take the men into my confidence as to the legality of
these proceedings, but Oswald, the boatswain, had a very shrewd
suspicion, I felt certain. I kept my watch as usual, although
little communication passed between my uncle and myself; and
during one night Oswald asserted that his timely arrival only
prevented Dalgleish from sneaking on me with a knife when I was
off my guard.</p>

<p>We successfully rifled two small flotillas of proas, and then
encountered a large fleet, which Dalgleish seemed anxious to let
alone, but my uncle, led on by the belief that there was a big
haul to be got, persisted in attacking. Dalgleish, in fear of his
skin, did not go off in the boat, and as soon as they boarded the
proa a signal gun was fired and a brisk fire opened on us from
the carronades the proa carried.</p>

<p>Whether by some means they had heard of our former raids, and
were prepared for us, I know not, but we received a great
surprise. We could not fire, for our men were on board, so
another boat was quickly manned, and I started with a rescue
party, leaving Oswald in charge of the ship. We had a hard fight
of it, but we managed to rescue my uncle, who had a bad cut on
his head, and such men as were left, and beat a hasty retreat as
the other junks were closing in.</p>

<p>Firing had ceased when we got on board, and I was astonished
to see Dalgleish on deck in irons. Oswald informed me that he had
tried to get the men to make sail on the vessel and sail away,
leaving us to our fate. He had even offered the men half the
pearls we had on beard if they would consent. While Oswald was
telling me this the wind had dropped, and the proas had got their
sweeps out, and we were in a bad way. We got ready to resist any
attempts at boarding, when to our surprise a clumsy boat put off
from the Rajah's proa, and pulled towards us.</p>

<p>The Rajah himself, richly dressed, came on board, and as I
stepped forward, addressed me in Dutch, which I understood
sufficiently well to make out his meaning. He had us in his
power, but would let us go freely if we restored the pearls we
had already taken. My uncle was insensible, so on my own account
I explained to the men what the terms were and the hopelessness
of our position.</p>

<p>While I was doing this the Rajah caught sight of Dalgleish.
Instantly his countenance changed, and a look of gratified hate
came over it.</p>

<p>Evidently he and Dalgleish had met before, and under
circumstances that had left a deep debt of vengeance behind.
Hastily spoke the Rajah, "Give me this man, and keep the
pearls."</p>

<p>"No," shrieked Dalgleish. "For the love of God, Ruthven,
shoot me before you hand me over to this man."</p>

<p>The sailors pressed forward, and Oswald said, "If the Rajah
wants Mr. Dalgleish, he can have him and welcome."</p>

<p>My protests were unheeded, rough but friendly hands held me
firm, and amidst imploring screams and entreaties Dalgleish was
carried away in the Rajah's boat; and I never saw him more. Of
his fate I dread to think&mdash;a Malay's vengeance is something
terrible.</p>

<p>A breeze sprung up and carried us away from the scene, and we
steered for the Cape. My uncle never recovered his proper senses,
so that I could not learn the bond that existed between the two,
but suspected that my uncle's piratical tendencies had got him
into trouble with the naval authorities, from which Dalgleish had
rescued him.</p>

<p>I divided the pearls with the crew in just proportion, and
sold the vessel, devoting the money to the comfort of my uncle
during the few years he lingered on.</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; THE MOUNT OF MISFORTUNE</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 16 Dec 1899</h3>

<p class="first">THE hill, or mountain, as it was generally
called, stood sheer on the bank of the river, which wheeled
sharply around its base. The river was broad and sandy, and in
its deeper pools the crocodiles of the Northern Territory
disported themselves, and in the sunny hours of the winter days
could be seen basking on the sandbanks in sleepy ease and
contentment.</p>

<p>The mount itself was the termination of a range some sixty
miles long, which started from the locality of a gold field, and
all along its course the daring, prospector had threaded his way,
taking, his life in his hand as ho did so, for the blacks at that
time were, still savage and dangerous.</p>

<p>On the mount by the river several parties had obtained good
results; but, strangely enough, none were able to follow it up.
Nearly every party obtained one good prospect, and after that
were mocked by the color of gold only.</p>

<p>Worse than all, no party had ever camped at the mount but what
death, in some shape, had overtaken one of its members. One had
gone to the river to wash, his clothes. His mates searched in
vain for him when he did not return. The clothes were there, but
the crocodiles had got the man. Another had sickened of the
malarial fever of the north and died, and been buried there.
Another had stuck his pick into his foot, and he, poor follow,
died a dreadful death, in the agony of lockjaw. Two had gone
there, and only one had come back again, disappeared in a day or
two, and the story went round that he had murdered his mate.</p>

<p>So the tales ran about the mountain on the bank of the Railly
River; and men began to get shy of going there.</p>

<p>"The next lot will get chawed up by the niggers," was the
opinion of one old digger. "They haven't had an innings yet, and
it's about their turn now."</p>

<p>"Whoever they, get, they won't get me. I wouldn't go down
there for an ounce a day, unless, there was a regular camp," said
another....</p>

<p>"What's the matter with the place?" asked a tall young fellow,
who was sitting by the fire with the others, a new arrival from
Queensland.</p>

<p>They told him the story, and he laughed as they all did at
first when these yarns were told by the old hands.</p>

<p>"Everybody gets a good prospect to start with and then they
can never get any more? Hanged if I don't try my luck there."</p>

<p>"We'll find your bones in a black's oven," said the old man
who had first spoken.</p>

<p>"Blacks!" returned the other, contemptuously. "You shouldn't
talk to an old Palmer man about niggers."</p>

<p>"You may be in nigger country for years, and one fine day,
when you're smoking your pipe and reckoning that you're as safe
as the Lord Mayor of London, crash will go your skull, and
nothing will trouble you any more."</p>

<p>"I know 'em," said the other.</p>

<p>"So do I," said the young man, "they tackled us like devils
twice on the Roper, when, we were coming across, and speared my
best horse. I owe them something. But about this mountain is it a
true bill about the prospects?"</p>

<p>"True as gospel; there's men in the camp here who have been
there and found it: always the same&mdash;one good prospect and
nothing more."</p>

<p>"It must be traced somehow. I'll have a try, anyhow. By the
way, a brother of mine came over here about a year ago, and I
have never heard of him since. Tall fellow, not unlike me; Sid
Thomson was his name&mdash;used to be called Lanky Sid!"</p>

<p>"Good Lord!" said the old man. "Thought there was something
familiar about the cut of you. Yes, your brother came here, worse
luck, but where he is now nobody can say."</p>

<p>"How's that?" said the other, quickly.</p>

<p>"Because he went down to that there mountain, and he never
came back again."</p>

<p>"Tell me all about it. I came over here from the Palmer,
partly in the hope of finding him. Sid and I were always great
chums from boys."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, Thomson, if that's your name," went on Pranks,
the old digger, "but it's a queer story, mind you, and none too
pleasant for you to hear. Your brother Sid, I knew him well. He
went down to the Railly River Mountain; would go against all we
said, just the same as you, and he hasn't come back yet."</p>

<p>"How long ago was that?"</p>

<p>"More than six months. But that's not all. He had a mate with
him&mdash;a fellow called Radforth. Radforth came back alone.
Didn't say much to anyone&mdash;and disappeared. Clean gone,
nobody know where."</p>

<p>"Didn't anybody ask about my brother?"</p>

<p>"Of course they did, naturally. But he answered in a way that
made 'em think that Sid was still down there, and he had just
come up for rations. Leastways, he bought rations, and vamoosed,
without a word to anybody. This made some people who didn't like
him&mdash;for he was an ugly tempered animal&mdash;suspect that
something was wrong, and a party was made to go down. Well, they
went, down there, but devil a thing could they find, beyond old
tracks and old camps. Some think, maybe; that your brother and
Radforth went across to the Victoria River, and so on to West
Australia, but&mdash;I don't."</p>

<p>"I'll go down there at once, and alone, too. I'll find this
thing out for myself, by God! If my brother has met with foul
play, I'll hunt up this Radford if he's on earth."</p>

<p>"Steady! There's no proof that your brother Is dead, nor that
Radford killed him; but the rumor has got about here. Still there
may be no truth in it."</p>

<p>"Anyhow, I'm going down to have a look at the place. I suppose
you can tell me how to find It?"</p>

<p>"Simple as possible. You have only to follow the range round,
and the mountain is right on the bank of the river. You'll see
scores of old tracks. But look out for the niggers! Look here,
boy; they'll get the next man."</p>

<p>"I'm going, and I'll find out what's become of my brother,"
said Thomson; "and I'll start tomorrow."</p>

<p><br>
TO a man who had been through, the Palmer rush, and finally
overland to the Northern Territory, a trip of 60 miles was
neither here nor there. Following the range along, he came on the
second day to the Mount of Misfortune, round the base of which
ran the Railly River. Lonely as was the place, young Thomson did
not feel it so, so much was his mind occupied with his brother's
fate, but although there wore no fresh tracks of blacks about,
visible to his experienced eye, he took the precaution of camping
some way up the slope of the mountain. There was good feed on the
flat and there was no fear of his horses straying far during the
night.</p>

<p>It was a beautifully clear moonlight night, and Thomson lay
for some time smoking and thinking of the quest he was engaged
in, when suddenly he heard a sound that caused him to raise
himself up on his elbow and listen attentively. There was no
mistake. Somebody was working with a pick on some part of the
mountain. The night was noiseless, there was not even a wild dog
howling, or a breath of wind stirring, and clearly and distinctly
came the sounds of the strokes of a pick.</p>

<p>Thomson did not hesitate long. He picked up his Martini
carbine, and stole carefully and as silently as possible in the
direction of the mysterious sound. It was hard to trace, the
echoes amongst the ranges were, confusing, but at last he located
it, and leaning over the edge of the rocky descent into a steep
gully, he saw the worker.</p>

<p>A man was digging down in the bed of the dry creek that ran
down the bottom of the gully. Working, and had been working for
some long time, as Thomson's digger's eye could see by the long
heap of wash dirt piled up. Someone had penetrated the mystery of
the mountain, and the source of the intermittent patches of gold,
and was working it out quietly for himself. Who was the man?</p>

<p>"I'll watch till daylight, but I'll find out," thought
Thomson.</p>

<p>For hours the solitary worker continued his labor, and the
watcher at his post watched him. He congratulated himself on
bringing his carbine; a man with the lust of gold in his brain
would not hesitate to commit murder to preserve his secret.</p>

<p>It was about one o'clock in the morning before the digger
ceased his toil, put down his tools, and straightened and
stretched himself. Then he commenced to follow the gully down,
and Thomson strode silently after him. Down, down, following
every turn and twist, the two went, for Thomson had now descended
into the gully, and kept his man well in sight.</p>

<p>Soon the river was in view, and still the stranger kept on
until he reached the bank. He never looked back, but descended
the path by a well-worn pad, and went out on the sand to the edge
of a deep waterhole that extended down the river for a long way.
There was an island covered with undergrowth just behind where he
had taken up his position, and here Thomson concealed himself, so
close that he could hear every word the man uttered. He wondered
much that his presence had not been detected before; but the man
before him seemed as though he was acting in a trance.</p>

<p>He was sitting at the edge of the water, looking down into its
moonlit surface, and talking strangely to himself, as was but
natural in a "hatter."</p>

<p>"Are you there, Sid? Was it painful when the crocodiles took
you? Come up and tell me about it. I've got the lead right
enough, and the secret of the mountain. Come up, old man, and
don't grin down there. Bah! It wasn't painful&mdash;you were
killed quick. Come up, man, and see how well I'm getting on."</p>

<p>Thomson could no longer restrain himself. There was no doubt
in his mind that this was Radforth, the murderer of his brother
in order to gain and keep to himself the secret of the mysterious
mountain. He sprang down from the island, and stood beside the
talker.</p>

<p>Radforth jumped upright, and looked at him aghast. The
resemblance between the brothers was only a general one, but in
the moonlight it sufficed.</p>

<p>"So you've come at last. Come at last," cried Radforth,
falling back. "Go, take it; I'll take your place." Turning
quickly away, he plunged into the bottomless hole, where the
crocodiles that haunted it received him joyfully. He never rose
again. Thomson watched for long, but the moonlit surface was
unrippled after the commotions of the plunge had subsided.</p>

<p>In the morning he found the camp of the recluse, whom solitude
and remorse had evidently driven crazy, and, in a diary, found
his worse fears confirmed. His brother and Radforth had
discovered what promised to be the true lead of the mountain
source of the gold. They had not quarrelled, but the prospects
were so rich that the greed of gold grew in Radforth's breast,
and he killed his unsuspecting comrade.</p>

<p>He took his body to the waterhole, where one could always see
the small eyes of a crocodile and a snout floating on the
surface. There he left it, but the crocodiles did not touch it.
Day after day, night after night, it lay there, and the
crocodiles would not touch the dead body, nor hide the murder.
Then in desperation he buried it in the sand, and that night the
crocodiles dug it up, and in the morning it was floating at the
brink of the sand-spit. And there it floated till the flesh
dropped from the bone, and the awful thing sank. But I the curse
was on the man, and every night after his hidden toil in the
gully he was constrained to go down to where the bones were
lying; and all I this he had written down.</p>

<p>In the morning Thomson went down to the edge of the waterhole,
and under the clear water opposite where Radforth had been
sitting he saw the bones and skull of what he felt sure was his
brother's body. He recovered them, and buried them before he
returned to the old camp. He told old Franks, and they kept
silence, and went back to the mountain on the Railly River.</p>

<p>The first loads of the washdirt piled up by the wretched
murderer washed out handsomely. The remainder, which they were
too disgusted to go all through, contained but specks. The man
had been driving himself mad over piling up load upon load of
worthless dirt. The mystery of the Mountain of Misfortune is a
mystery still.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. &mdash; THE PRISONER OF WAR</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 18 Dec 1897</h3>

<p class="first">IT all passed so quickly that it seemed as
though a miracle had happened. One minute we were rejoicing over
our victory, and the next, an unexpected broadside, poured in at
close quarters, had covered our decks, with dead, dying, and
wreckage. While the Portuguese ship was just hauling down her
colors, and we were all intent upon her, the French ship we had
seen in the morning had crept up in the smoke, bringing a light
breeze with her, and had nearly blown us out of the water. There
was an awful silence after the deadly thunder of that broadside;
then a loud voice hailed us, calling on us to strike our
flag.</p>

<p>I got on to my knees, finding myself almost unhurt, and looked
at my father, who was shouting something to me, his voice broken
with a curious sort of whistle. I managed to stagger where he
lay, his body covered with blood. He was trying to point out to
me the sail-maker who was going aft to haul down the flag. I
guessed what my father meant, and drawing a pistol hailed him to
stop. He kept on, however, answering something, and had got his
hand on the halliards when I shot him down. Then I knelt by my
father, and braced myself for what was coming to send us to the
bottom. But nothing came, and presently I heard footsteps and
voices approaching. One whom I took to be the French captain came
up with another officer. He was a handsome, gallant-looking man,
and I scrambled to my feet to greet him properly.</p>

<p>"I am Captain La Roche, of the <i>Victoire</i>," he said. "You
are helpless, and sinking, so I refrained from firing into you
again. Is this your captain?"</p>

<p>All this was in very good English, and I hastened to
reply.</p>

<p>"This is Captain Stapleton, of the privateer <i>Eagle</i>. He
is my father, and I fear me, dead."</p>

<p>The officer who accompanied the captain stooped clown, and
rising shook his head&mdash;my father was dead.</p>

<p>"He died like a brave man, and will go down with his ship,"
said La Roche. "Now, will you muster up what men you have left,
for we have but scant time?"</p>

<p>I got my men together, and few enough there were. We entered
the French boats, and were rowed away from the sinking ship as
prisoners of war. One of the French sailors was going to haul
down the colors, but the captain stopped him, like the truly
gallant man he was. The vessels had drifted apart, and when we
had reached the <i>Victoire</i>, it was not long before the brave
<i>Eagle</i> plunged under. She went down bows first, the last
thing to go under being the English flag at her peak; and our
foolish fellows cheered it as it vanished.</p>

<p>The Portuguese ship had received much damage, but the
Frenchman was, of course, untouched, and it being calm weather
they kept company for some days, repairing the Portuguese
damages. Then we were transferred on board.</p>

<p>"I would have kept you with me," said La Roche, "but we have
no room for prisoners; and if I take you to France, heaven knows
when you will be set free, for it is a death grapple between
France and England. But this paltry squabble with Portugal will
soon be over; and you will be released. Goodbye, and if it comes
to your chance to help a Frenchman, do so for my sake."</p>

<p>I grasped his hand, and we parted. I never met the
generous-hearted fellow again, nor even heard of him. God rest
his soul for a true gentleman and a sailor.</p>

<p>Our destination, we learned, was Goa, in India, and we found
some difference in the dirty Portuguese ship and the trim
Frenchman. I especially suffered a change. La Roche had taken me
to his cabin, but in consequence of there being two Portuguese
officers on board as passengers, I had to go forward, as the men
of gilt lace and buttons objected to the presence of a heretic
pirate. Being young, I naturally resented this, and foolishly
took every small opportunity of showing it, so that when we
arrived at Goa, the unfriendly Don Gongala da Sarmentó, who was a
high official, managed that I should be separated from my
companions and confined alone.</p>

<p>I received anything but handsome treatment, and I found out
afterwards that the reason of my being so separated was that when
peace was proclaimed soon after my arrival, my companions were at
once released, while I was left to linger within the gloomy
walls, forgotten. I sent several memorials to the Governor, but
received no acknowledgment, and was making desperate resolutions
to attempt escape at all hazards, when an event occurred that
made me no longer sigh for freedom. The old woman who cooked the
vile food I had to put up with was the wife of my gaoler, and the
pair had taken some pity on my youth and loneliness, hence I had
obtained a little more freedom. I used to visit the fat old cook
in the kitchen, and found that it opened into the garden of the
governor of the gaol, a very high and mighty dignitary. I was
permitted to wander about the garden at certain hours, and when
nobody was likely to be about. Escape from the gaol was easy
enough, but how to get out of Goa?</p>

<p>How shall I tell what befell me in that quaint old garden?
Only that one day I met a dark-eyed girl, the daughter of the
governor, and again we met, and it came about that the bright
southern maiden, the devout young Catholic, fresh from her
convent, loved the ragged heretic prisoner.</p>

<p>One day I was talking to the old cook, and she asked me slyly
if I had seen the little donna in the garden. In her garrulous
way she went on telling me that a marriage had been arranged
between her and Da Sarmentó, the man to whom I owed my long
imprisonment, as I afterwards knew, though then I only suspected
it. This was pleasant news for a helpless and hopeless
prisoner.</p>

<p>"Frank, why are you prisoner?" said my sweetheart to me the
day after the cook's communication.</p>

<p>"Because my country and yours are at war with one
another."</p>

<p>"I think not. I do not know much, but I heard long since that
there was peace with England; and even now there lies an English
ship in the bay."</p>

<p>I leapt up, mad with rage and hope. Kept a prisoner of war
during peace time, and an English ship in the bay. I caught Nita
In my arms.</p>

<p>"Goodbye love, for the present; I must reach that ship or die;
and if I reach it, by heaven I'll cut Sarmentó's ears off. If I
fail, Nita, remember you must tell the English captain of my
being kept here."</p>

<p>I had her still in my embrace kissing away her frightened
tears, when I was roughly dragged away by strong hands. My enemy
had surprised us with a Ale of soldiers. I fought like a demon,
and wrenched a musket from one of them, and felled another to the
ground. Then I rushed on Sarmentó, who was dragging Nita away.
The coward! He put the shrieking girl in front of him to guard
himself. The men were closing in on me again, so I turned and
fled. I dashed through the kitchen and down the passage they
used. The door was open; I knocked down a sleeping sentry, anti
was in the street. Then I made for the bench. Sure enough an
English man-of-war lay at anchor, and on the beach was a boat, a
midshipman, and a couple of sailors tending.</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you?" was my greeting, as I ran up panting
and breathless.</p>

<p>"I am an Englishman, unjustly kept here as a prisoner of war,
and I claim the protection of my flag."</p>

<p>"War! Why we have not been at war with these here beggars for
ever so long. Kept an Englishman prisoner, eh? Won't old Fire
Irons raise Cain?"</p>

<p>The middy told me the ship was the <i>Sea Lion</i>, commanded
by the Honorable Augustus Firontes, usually known as Fire Irons.
He condescendingly informed me that I was safe under his
protection, for which I felt duly grateful. The captain and his
lieutenant, and the remainder of the crew came down, and I told
my story over again.</p>

<p>Firontes at once took me on board, and furnished me with the
necessaries I stood sadly in need of, then he went on shore in
state to interview the Governor-General. There was a serious
difference of opinion, but the wily Portuguese was too many for
the blunt English captain, and explained the whole matter away in
the most elaborate fashion. Fire Irons came on board muttering
threats of bombarding the town, but he could do nothing else.</p>

<p>That night I went ashore, accompanied by my new friend, the
middy. The captain, who knew my father by repute as captain of
the most dashing Letter of Marque that ever harassed the King's
enemies, had given me what money I required, and I made the old
cook happy with a handsome present; but of Nita I could learn no
word; but I left a long letter, telling her I would return. I
could only go on board disheartened, although Chambers, the
middy, was full of suggestions of cutting-out parties and
searching the pious city of Goa.</p>

<p>On reaching England I fond that I was a wealthy man. My father
had laid by money, and my uncle, a rich man, had just died, and I
was sole heir to both. It was peace time now, and I easily got a
ship for my purpose, and had my pick of men. Chambers obtained
leave and accompanied me, and we sailed for Goa. After dark I
went ashore, and found out my old friend the cook. I had just
arrived in time. Nita was to be married the following day to Da
Sarmentó.</p>

<p>There was some sort of ceremony going on that might at the
Governor's house, and as Chambers and I crept through the garden
we saw one of the large windows was all ablaze with light. It was
but ten feet or so from the ground, and when we looked In we saw
a brilliant gathering.</p>

<p>I saw nothing of Nita, but I saw Sarmentó in a brilliant
uniform among a crowd of others equally tricked out. Chambers
peered in beside me, and when I pointed out Sarmentó he put his
hand to his pistol, as if there was to be shooting there and
then. Just then I saw Nita. She was close to him; I had
overlooked her. She was sitting with an elderly lady, looking sad
and sick. The window was open, and I determined on a bold move. I
whispered my instructions to Chambers, who dropped and stood
ready; then I stole into the room. I anticipated a scream from
Nita, but hoped I should be quick enough to get away with her
before any of them could stop me. In a minute I stood beside
her.</p>

<p>"I have come for you, Nita," I whispered. She turned and saw
me. She was about to cry out, but checked it, and sprang into my
arms. But never did woman scream as did her companion. I made for
the window as the company rushed towards me, and was lifting my
sweetheart to pass her down to Chambers, when Sarmentó fired a
pistol at me. I felt nothing at the time, and carefully passed
Nita into Chambers's arms, jumping down myself.</p>

<p>"She has fainted," said Chambers, as we pushed on, he, who was
now a strong, athletic fellow, carrying Nita, whilst I followed,
keeping off our pursuers, who were not very eager in the
chase.</p>

<p>We joined our men, and were comparatively safe, and I now took
Nita from Chambers. Horror! she was covered with blood, amid as
her head fell back and the light of a lantern gleamed on her
white face, I saw she was dead&mdash;dead by the bullet intended
for me, fired by the coward who did not dare to come to close
quarters to rescue his intended bride.</p>

<p>Drums were beating now, and the town was roused. My men
hurried me to the boats, and we regained the ship, still bearing
the poor girl's body with us. Chambers took command and got the
ship out before they could bring the guns of the fort to bear
upon us, for I was stupefied with grief, and divided between
remorse for my rash act and rage at the murderer. Chambers roused
me up by morning, and we buried my unfortunate sweetheart in a
sailor's grave. Then there was only one thing left for me to do,
and that was revenge her.</p>

<p>Chambers tried hard to dissuade me from my purpose, but I was
not to be denied, and we had become too fast friends for anything
to part us. I heard that Sarmentó had been appointed Governor of
Macao, in China, and I hung about the coast until I had news of
his departure, and then I started in pursuit. Twice I engaged his
ship, and twice we were separated by a storm.</p>

<p>At last one night I lost sight of my enemy, and though I kept
on the course be should have gone, I failed to sight him morning
after morning. On through the Straits of Malacca, and never a
sail. Then an idea occurred to me&mdash;the ship had made south,
probably to the Portuguese settlements on Timor. We changed our
course, and with a fair wind sped there. We coasted along the
beautiful island, but there was no sign of my enemy. Perhaps we
had got ahead of him. I sailed back on the course he should have
come and met him.</p>

<p>It was a lowering day, but a dead, sullen calm had set in, and
we lay all day in sight of one another. In the morning there was
a heavy bank to the north-west, and a muttered rumble of thunder
that never ceased.</p>

<p>"It will blow us apart again," said Chambers, who was leaning
against a gun with me watching the Portuguese ship. "Look, they
are taking in all sail, and we'd better do the same."</p>

<p>I saw the justice of this, and soon both ships were stripped.
None too soon, for, without warning, the storm burst on us like a
thunderbolt, and we fled south before it. All night it raged, and
the next morning there was no abatement.</p>

<p>"Look here," said Chambers, "we shall be ashore directly," and
he pointed to where the land of New Holland lay on the chart, the
country lately taken possession of by the British.</p>

<p>"We'll both go together," I answered, for the Portuguese ship
was still in sight to leeward of us. At noon the storm lulled and
the weather cleared. We saw before us a long, low, level
coast.</p>

<p>"The Portuguese have hoisted a signal of distress," said
Chambers, who was looking at her through a telescope. We bore
down to her, and found she had sprung a leak, and was sinking.
The sea had fallen enough for the boats to live, and we took off
crew and passengers, but amongst them was no Da Sarmentó.</p>

<p>To all my questions I could get no information, and it was not
until some hours had passed that an idea flashed across Chambers,
who had been very active in saving the Portuguese.</p>

<p>"Look among the women," he said. "I thought one of them was
extra tall." True enough, we found him, hidden in a woman's dress
and veil.</p>

<p>I headed the ship in shore to where I saw a sandy beach, but
it was dark when we were off it, and I anchored for the
night.</p>

<p>Next morning, with one of the officers of the sunken ship and
Chambers, I landed and fought Sarmentó on that strip of beach on
the shore of the great unknown land at the south.</p>

<p>I disarmed him twice, and the cur begged for his life, so I
gave it to him; but I left him on that lonely shore, and sailed
away to Timor. I landed the crew and passengers, and
returned.</p>

<p>We found his dead body on the sand, dry and shrivelled.
Nothing had touched it, neither savages nor wild beasts, if there
are savages and wild beasts there.</p>

<p>So I was revenged, but it was of no avail; it could not bring
me back the dark-eyed girl who loved the ragged, lonely English

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; THE MAD HATTER</h2>

<h3><i>Australian Town and Country Journal</i>, Sydney,
Australia, 26 Nov 1898</h3>

<p class="first">THE man was squatting by the edge of the pretty
little stream that gurgled and rippled along, and, to my
astonishment, as I rode closer, I saw that he was gold-washing,
or apparently so. Now, as the country round about did not appear
at all auriferous; nor did I know of any diggings in the
neighborhood, I felt considerably astonished.</p>

<p>He did not move when I came close.</p>

<p>"How are you getting along?" I asked, for the sake of opening
a conversation. "An ounce to the dish?"</p>

<p>He twisted his head around to look at me, and said: "Not now,
but it don't run bad. Three and four pennyweights."</p>

<p>He was a solemn-looking old fellow, and he made this statement
so seriously that he rather staggered me. Then he went on quietly
finishing the last of the dish, while I leant on my horse's neck
and watched him. When he had finished he straightened himself up,
and, with a satisfied smile, handed me the dish. I took it and
inspected it. There was a little black sand, such as you can find
anywhere in Australia; beyond that, nothing. I gave him back the
dish without a remark, for I concluded it was a joke of some sort
he was playing off on me.</p>

<p>Taking the dish back, he remarked, "You wouldn't think stuff
ran like that about here, would you?"</p>

<p>"No, I should not," I replied. "How is it that the place is
not rushed?"</p>

<p>The old man looked at me with a cunning grin.</p>

<p>"'Cos they can't. All this land about here once belonged to
me; but I was swindled out of it. But not all&mdash;not all. I
was too sharp for them. They didn't know that there was gold on
this bit of land, so the swindlers left me that as worthless and
now I'm working it. Listen," and he came close; "I've got nearly
enough to buy back everything. I've been sticking at it now tor
years, and as soon as I've got all I want I mean to buy
everything back."</p>

<p>I didn't know quite what to make of it, but the little
township to which I was bound was just ahead; and I wished him
luck and pushed on, leaving him filling up another dish from a
bag of dirt that lay beside him.</p>

<p><br>
SEATED in the verandah of the hotel that evening, I mentioned
to the landlord my meeting with the old man.</p>

<p>"Old Forsyth, the mad hatter," he said. "Yes, the old fellow's
a character, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"He told me he owned all the country about here once?"</p>

<p>"Partly true; he had a big station once; and got a lot of land
purchased, but he lost it all."</p>

<p>"He said he was swindled."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's part of his madness. He played the fool, and, of
course, others took advantage of him. I'll tell you the old man's
story, if you like; it's a queer one."</p>

<p>"Naturally," I agreed, and the landlord commenced.</p>

<p><br>
"OLD Forsyth originally made his money on the gold fields, but
that was before my time. When I came here he had a good bit of
land, and leased a fair-sized station, and was a hard-working
fellow with a capital bank account. He was a widower, with no
children, and married a young wife. She was a good-looking fool,
who married him for his money, and hadn't the sense to know when
she was well off. She finally eloped with a flash overseer he
had, and that settled poor Forsyth.</p>

<p>"He drank and muddled away all he had in about eight years. Of
course, he was swindled to a certain extent; unscrupulous people
took advantage of his state to make good bargains out of him. No
one would have believed that a man like him could have been so
fond of the woman; but there is no mistake, it broke him right
up. That's his story. He wound up with a bad attack of brain
fever, and since then he's been a harmless lunatic, possessed
with an idea that he has a private gold mine, and has panned out
a fortune, in that creek. Of course there's no gold in this part,
I need not tell you that."</p>

<p>"How does he exist?" I asked.</p>

<p>"That's where the romance comes in. When his wife ran away,
she left him a year-old baby daughter, and when this child was
born he was so delighted that he insisted on settling on her a
birthday gift of a small farm, and it was tied up so tight that
when the drink softened his brain, he could not make ducks and
drakes of that; though many tried to get it from him. It's not of
very much value, but that deserted girl has grown up a regular
wonder. Smart and pretty. She keeps a lot of poultry, and runs
the farm as a dairy. She's between 18 and 19 now, and could have
married well half a dozen times; but no, she runs the place, and
looks after the old man. Not that he wants much looking after,
for as long as he's allowed to fill his bag up with what he
thinks is wash-dirt, and take it down to the creek and wash it,
he's happy."</p>

<p>The landlord stopped and lit a fresh cigar.</p>

<p>"There's one thing," he went on, "which none of us can make
out. No one stops on the place at night but the old man and the
girl, and a queer-looking servant woman they have there. Nobody's
ever asked there. Two or three parsons have tried, in that
familiar way they can put on when they like, but all they've
got's a snubbing for their pains. No, there's no reason why the
girl shouldn't marry and have a home and family of her own, for
the old man is no hindrance; he's harmless; but there's something
behind. But it's nothing bad, mind you," said the landlord,
getting up, when I proposed an adjournment to the bar. "Nobody
here would believe anything bad of Miss Forsyth, the mad hatter's
daughter."</p>

<p><br>
IT was years, but not many years, afterwards that I went back
again to the little township where I had met the "mad hatter." To
my surprise, the first man I met was an old friend, a doctor, who
had settled down in Yungellalla in hopes to pick up a practice.
From him I learned the sequel of old Forsyth's story. I was
introduced to Mrs. Lofell, the wife of the doctor. Her maiden
name was Miss Forsyth.</p>

<p>"I was called in to see old Forsyth," said Lofell, when he
explained matters. "He was sick unto death. It necessitated my
being there night and morning, and I found out the little mystery
that surrounded the small household.</p>

<p>"That girl&mdash;my wife&mdash;how instinct had taught her, I
know not; nor would I seek to pry in that great mystery that
means the charity of femininity, was shielding her unhappy
mother. She was the woman who was the disfigured servant. Oh!
that farce the girl kept on.</p>

<p>"Every night the woman, who appeared occasionally before the
working men on the farm as the disfigured servant, came and took
her place as Forsyth's wife. Not the disgraced wife! That had all
been lost and obscured in Forsyth's clouded brain. He retained
one idea, that was the restoration of his vanished wealth. In the
evening his wife appeared in the dress of her youth, and the old
man was happy and contented. That was the secret of the girl's
life. She kept her mother in the same guise, as far as the
husband was concerned, as when she was the young bride he wooed
and won. That is all. But it was such a deed of devotion that it
won my love, and you know the rest."</p>

<h2><a id="ch13"></a>13. &mdash; TRALOOA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 20 &amp; 27 Jan 1900</h3>

<p class="first">LONG years had passed since any man had tried
his luck on the deserted little gold field of Tralooa. It never
had been more than a mere flicker of a rush, that had vanished at
the first whiff of bad luck. It had now lain for years, bearing
on its face all the misery of a deserted gold field. The mounds
of earth were still visible, for the grass of northern Australia
is not always so kindly disposed as that of countries with milder
climates, and does not so readily cover up the scars which man
makes on the surface of mother earth.</p>

<p>The nearest township, if such it could be called, was four or
five miles away, and, excepting when now and again a little mob
of bush cattle wandered on to the old abandoned field, and one of
them tumbled down one of the old shafts that had not yet fallen
in and got filled up, and remained there until death stopped its
futile bellowings, the solitude was pretty well unbroken.</p>

<p>One day a strange cavalcade appeared on the lonely scene of
past and buried hopes. A creaking old cart, drawn by a bony
horse, drew up there one afternoon, and an aged couple got out of
it, and looked at the dreary scene for a moment in silence.</p>

<p>"Seems as though all was gone to rack and ruin, mother," said
the old man to the old woman.</p>

<p>"It is dreary, dear. Shall we camp here?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Best get a little further away," he replied. "I don't want
the old moke to tumble into one of the old holes to-night, and
he's sure to do it if he gets a chance. We'll go about a mile
down the creek."</p>

<p>"And is there were Jack was the last we heard of him?" said
the old dame, looking curiously around on the desolate spot. "It
looks like a graveyard. Yes, Tom, we'll go down the creek a bit,
and camp."</p>

<p>"This is the place, Madge; but when I came to see Jack here it
was just like a Sydney street for life. Lord love you, what a
change there's been!"</p>

<p>The old fellow sighed. During many years he had persuaded
himself that unfortunate Tralooa, with its one store and shanty,
had been a scene of glittering gaiety and wild dissipation when
he had come up there to see his son, one of the prospectors of
the only claim that had a poor little show. It had been many long
years since the old man's son had written to his mother a glowing
letter of the fortune he was making and the good times that were
coming, and the old man had started and come up to see him. From
the time he had said goodbye to his son, and returned home to the
struggling little dairy farm, nothing had ever been heard of
their son. Jack and the brilliant fortune had disappeared
together. The old man had written, but could obtain no tidings
save that the little gold field had been abandoned, and the
fortune-seekers gone no one knew whither.</p>

<p>The hard times came, dry season after dry season, and the farm
was lost. The old man had a brother in another part of the
colony, who would give him and his wife a home, and there they
were now journeying, and, as the road went close to Tralooa, they
had turned off to visit the place where their son had last been
heard of.</p>

<p>"Where was Jack's tent?" asked the mother.</p>

<p>The old man looked about in a confused manner.</p>

<p>"Things is so changed," he muttered. "As near as I can make
out it would have been up on yon ridge. Them two uprights would
perhaps be where the store was, and next to it were a
public-house and a right pretty girl in it; seemed to think no
end of Jack too, called him Mr. Harding."</p>

<p>"Some painted hussy," said the old woman.</p>

<p>"Well, she might have been, for she had a rare color on her
cheeks and lips. And Jack, he put his money down like a lord, and
he looked like one, too. Ah, he was a handsome boy."</p>

<p>"And it is a pity," said the old woman, severely, "that you
had no more sense than to go with the boy into a drinking shop,
and take notice of a girl's lips, at your age."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said the old man, soothingly, "there was such
bustle and excitement, and Jack wouldn't be said no to; there was
no harm done, Madge."</p>

<p>The old woman only gave a contemptuous snort, and, after
gazing for some time round the field, hobbled back to the cart,
and they resumed their journey.</p>

<p><br>
THE next morning they reached the little township of Tralooa,
from which the gold field took its name, and stopped a few hours
to purchase some rations.</p>

<p>"Was you here when the rush was on?" asked the old woman of
the storekeeper's wife.</p>

<p>"Yes, and before it. We've been here a long time. The rush was
not much&mdash;how did you come to hear of it?"</p>

<p>"Our son, Jack Harding, was one of the prospectors," said the
old man, with ill-concealed pride.</p>

<p>"Jack Harding,' echoed the woman, looking at the old couple,
curiously. 'Yes, I remember him.'</p>

<p>"We have lost sight of him since the rush&mdash;never heard a
word of him or from him."</p>

<p>Anyone could have seen that the storekeeper's wife knew
something that she wouldn't tell. Anyone but the primitive old
pair before her.</p>

<p>"You don't see the papers, maybe?" she said.</p>

<p>"No, missus; we have had no time for reading papers."</p>

<p>"O, I was just thinking about those personals, as they call
'em, that they put in. Suppose your son had put in one of those,
saying he was going away, you wouldn't have seen it?"</p>

<p>"No, missus."</p>

<p>But the storekeeper's wife was thinking of something else that
had been in the paper&mdash;a "personal" truly, but very
different from the personals she had been talking about. "No, I
remember Jack Harding; but I can't say where he is now&mdash;he
just disappeared, like the rest."</p>

<p>Then she chatted with the old pair, and found out where they
were going, and asked them to stay and have a meal, and sent the
simple couple on their way contented, feeling that they had
received the kindness for Jack's sake. But the storekeeper's wife
had told them a lie for their own sake, for she and everybody
about Tralooa knew that Jack Harding was in gaol for nearly
murdering a man.</p>

<p>Unwitting of this, the old couple journeyed on until they came
to a fair-sized township, some thirty miles from their
destination. Here they camped on the common outside. It was,
growing dark; the old bodies had had their tea and were sitting
contentedly round the small bit of fire that the exigencies of a
small allowance of firewood such as is to be found in the
neighborhood of a township commonage allowed, when the noise of a
coarse, cursing voice was heard approaching.</p>

<p>"Some drunken woman. I hope she won't come here," said the old
man.</p>

<p>But he was wrong. The shrieking voice, wrangling with itself,
as in very despair of somebody else to exchange curses with, came
in towards the little spark of fire, and halted there, in the
person of a besotted woman hugging a gin bottle.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't I sit at this fire?" she demanded, although no
one had spoken.</p>

<p>"Seems to me I you ain't got much manners when a lady, who's
been brought up as a lady, pays you a visit. 'Take a seat; my
dear;' 'oh, yes, with pleasure!' and the foul creature plumped
herself down beside the shrinking form of old Mrs. Harding.</p>

<p>"Got a pannikin?" the woman said. "Seems to me that you're
very shy of your plate in this camp? Ha-ha! Plate in the camp!
Why, I've drunk out of plate with my crest on it. My blooming
crest! Two crossed bottles and a corkscrew rampant. That's
heraldry, you know; but you don't understand. Give us a pannikin,
old man."</p>

<p>"Help me into the cart, Tom," pleaded the old woman, as Tom
gave his uninvited guest a pannikin.</p>

<p>"What, going already!" said the drunken woman; "leaving me all
alone with the old man. Well, you aren't jealous as others, so
keep your hair on."</p>

<p>Then the drunken mutter subsided into a sleep&mdash;a sleep so
sound and deep, the sleep of intoxication; so deep was it that
the old man drew back fearfully and shudderingly, for he could
not account for the change in her face.</p>

<p> "GIVE ME some more!"</p>

<p>The old man helped her to some more gin, with the same look on
his face; then he suddenly dropped both glass and bottle, and
said, "I know you now!"</p>

<p>The old man made no effort to pick up the fallen bottle and
glass, but stood staring at her with a look that forced her
attention.</p>

<p>"Look here," said the old fellow, "when you was asleep just
now, your face was quite changed. I saw the gal that talked and
laughed, and smiled with her red lips on my son, my boy, at
Tralooa Gold Fields. Was it true&mdash;was you the gal? Now you
are awake, and asking for more gin, you are only the drunken
woman as came to our camp tonight. When you was asleep you was
different. Perhaps you was dreaming&mdash;dreaming maybe as I do
sometimes&mdash;of Jack coming back all a-smiling and happy, with
a pocketful of gold."</p>

<p>The woman gazed at him awe-struck, while the last nip of gin
gurgled melodiously out of the neck of the overturned bottle.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" she asked, "and why do you speak of Tralooa,
and of Jack? If it's Jack Harding you mean&mdash;handsome
Jack&mdash;you'll never see him coming back smiling with a
pocketful of gold."</p>

<p>"Where is he, woman?"</p>

<p>"Jack, Jack Harding; he got put in gaol and he's there
still."</p>

<p>"Jack! my Jack! in gaol! What could he be put in gaol
for?"</p>

<p>"Dear! oh! deary me!" said the woman, getting maudlin.
"Through me if you want to know. I led Jack on, and he
half-killed a man he met with me, and he was nearly being hanged
only the man didn't die. Lord! Lord! to think of a real lady
being brought to this!" and the wretched creature, from whom all
trace of womanly beauty had departed, bowed down her head and
wept piteously.</p>

<p>The old man stood, with white fury on his face, when a figure
intervened, for Madge had scrambled out of the cart and come
between them.</p>

<p>"Leave her to me," she said; "seems to me"&mdash;for with all
the misery of the revelation she could not, woman-like, resist a
wifely gibe&mdash;"that you'da been better employed giving Jack a
lecture than drinking with him."</p>

<p>The old man kept quiet, and the old woman turned to the
bloated thing of shame, and put her arm round her neck.</p>

<p>"Tell me about Jack?" she said. "He was my son, and I have a
right to know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" the woman gabbled on incoherently. "I am sorry, but he
was so forcible, and wild, and thought I was an innocent young
girl, God help us! and so when he got jealous he half-killed
another man, thought he had killed him outright, and went out and
boasted about it, and was arrested, and kept in gaol to see
whether the other man would die or not. And so, then he lived,
and it was all my fault; he got ten years for it."</p>

<p>So ended the incoherent gabble, and the outcast put her head
on her knees, and wept maudlin tears.</p>

<p>"So Jack's in gaol," said the old woman. "My Jack in gaol, on
account of such as she. I was cross with you just now, old man,
but never you mind that; help me back into the cart. Ten
years&mdash;ten long years, and then when he comes out he won't
be my Jack. No, old man, I couldn't bear to see him. Help me back
into the cart."</p>

<p>The old man did as he was told, and stood by her leaning over
her, sobbing, and holding her hand.</p>

<p>"Tom!" she said suddenly, "If I died here I'd have to be
buried here; do you think you can turn back, and let me die in
the old place&mdash;near the old place rather&mdash;so as I could
be buried there, where I always thought of Jack as a child. Don't
you think you could manage it, Tom?"</p>

<p>"I could, Madge, but," and he broke down utterly; "What's to
become of me?"</p>

<p>"God knows, old man. We are both broken old stock, of no good
to anybody. Only I must go back and die where I thought of my
Jack as a boy who scarcely knew gaol by name."</p>

<p>"I'll take you back, Madge to-morrow morning, I will; now go
to sleep, dearie."</p>

<p>The old man went back to the fire, and crooned over it: the
woman was still sitting with her bowed head in her hands. The old
man did not know enough to discriminate between the remorse born
of gin and that which sprang from the real emotions. He sat
sullenly down, and the strangely assorted couple watched the fire
die out together.</p>

<p>Presently the woman rose.</p>

<p>"Look here," she said, and her face had somehow got back some
of the old look in it. "Tell the old woman that Jack sent her
this; Jack entrusted it with me for her, and take her back to
where she wants to die, and let her die in peace, and bury her as
she wishes. Never tell her that I gave it you myself, and it was
never Jack's."</p>

<p>She produced from some part of her ragged dress a knotted
handkerchief, undid the knots, and put in the old man's hands
more sovereigns than he had ever seen together before; but that
was not many, truly.</p>

<p>"But you," mumbled the surprised old creature.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;well, I shall get killed, maybe, over this; but never
you mind. You take the old woman back and let her die in
peace."</p>

<p>And she went out like a ghost into the dark night, and left
the old man staggered and stupid, with the gold in his hands.</p>

<p><br>
THEY got back, the old couple, and the old woman died in such
peace as she could find left, and the old man soon followed her.
But, owing to a bad habit of never reading a newspaper, they did
not read of a brutal murder, committed near the township they had
once stopped at, nor how it was said that one of the criminal
class had beaten a woman to death for losing some stolen money he
had entrusted her with.</p>

<h2><a id="ch14"></a>14. &mdash; THE PUZZLE CHART</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 7, 14 Oct 1899</h3>

<p class="first">IT was in one of the worst parts of Western
Australia that we pulled up and looked over the most uninviting
landscape a man could see anywhere in Australia. We halted on the
top of a ridge considerably higher than its fellows, and from
there looked over a dry and barren expanse of country, of which
the only constituent parts were stones, mulga, and spinifex.</p>

<p>Not a living thing was visible; not even a kite hovering in
the air; the whole was absolute desert of the worst kind,
destitute not only of life, but of anything that could support
life. The sun was about two hours off setting; the sky was
cloudless; the day had been excessively hot; and our horses stood
badly in need of water.</p>

<p>We looked at each other in some dismay.</p>

<p>'Let's have a squint at that chart,' said Ned. I took it from
my saddle pouch, and together we went over it.</p>

<p>Yes, we had followed the directions quite correctly, but the
country we had arrived at was of an entirely different character
to what we had been led to expect; in fact, it could not well
have been more different.</p>

<p>'Thirty miles back to the last water,' groaned Ned. 'Here's a
fix; and all thanks to believing in that blooming old chart. The
man was looney before he died.'</p>

<p>'Loony or not, we've got to get out of this somehow.'</p>

<p>I looked around, and noticed a desert gum much older and
higher than its fellows&mdash;in fact, it was a wonder to see so
tall a tree in such a position. It was but a short distance away,
and I told the black boy to go and climb up it, and see if he
could see anything from the higher elevation. As a blackfellow
naturally does, he looked all round the tree before commencing
the ascent; then he called to us to come over, which we hastily
did.</p>

<p>'Whitefellow cut 'em,' said the boy, pointing to some marks on
the tree.</p>

<p>They were old, but had been cut deep at the time, and the
desert gum grows slowly, and the letters were easily
distinguishable.</p>

<p><br>
'CLIMB' we both spelled out together.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' shouted Ned; 'we've struck oil after all.'</p>

<p>'Up you go, Tommy Dod!' I said to the boy. The twisted trees
of that part of the country are easy to climb, and Tommy was soon
as high as he could safely go. He was so long in speaking that we
both impatiently cried out to know if he saw anything.</p>

<p>'Yowi. Over there,' and he pointed down the very valley along
which we had been hopelessly gazing.</p>

<p>'What name?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Land tumble down,' he said; ''nother fellow country come
up.'</p>

<p>Both Ned and I guessed the truth at once. What from our
elevation, we had taken for the end of the valley, was really an
abrupt fall to better and different country. We mounted, and, not
having much time to spare, pressed on as fast as the nature of
the country allowed.</p>

<p>We got to the abrupt decline about half an hour before
sundown, and to our joy saw, no great distance beneath us, the
patch of open country through which ran the tea-tree creek marked
on the old chart, for which we were in search. But for the
accident of finding the old tree, which seems to have been
purposely omitted from the chart in order to mislead people, or,
as it might have been in our case, lure them to their death, we
should certainly have missed what we sought.</p>

<p>However, we thought nothing about this as we hurried down the
steep decline, and made for the creek where, according to the
rough chart, we should find water. This turned out to be the
case, and we were soon comfortably camped.</p>

<p>It is now time to relate how this chart, or tracing, came into
our possession. About one hundred and twenty miles from where we
then were was an outside mining camp called Goram Gerup. Ned and
I had been working there for some twelve months and knew the
story of Loony Jones, who periodically made an excursion into the
bush to search for something, which evidently he could not
find.</p>

<p>The last time Looney Jones came back he was bad with fever. He
camped near us, and we looked after him a bit, but lie was too
for gone, and eventually died. Before dying, however, he gave us
the ragged and much-worn chart, which he averred was the key to
wealth, if we could only follow the track indicated on to its
end. He had been vainly trying for more than a year, and
gradually lost all he had in the vain search. Where he himself
got the chart from he would not reveal, and Ned and I always
suspected that he had murdered a man for it.</p>

<p>This belief was now changed into a certainty, as if it had
been honestly come by the donor of it would have told him the
secret of the tree. If a man missed that guide, he might wander
amongst the spinifex gullies until he was worn out, and his
horses dead. Evidently Jones had never struck the tree.</p>

<p>'I vote we have a day's spell here,' I remarked to Ned, just
before finally turning in. 'There's grass and water, the nags
want a rest, and we will poke about and see where we are.'</p>

<p>'Right,' returned Ned, and the next moment we were off on a
long dreamless sleep until morning.</p>

<p><br>
THE patch of open country was but small, and surrounded by the
barren spinifex ridges. The presence of the water was easily
accounted for by the fact that where we were was a sort of basin
or depression, into which all the drainage and rainflow of the
surrounding country found its way. Naturally we both looked first
in the direction, in which the little creek ran in the hope of
seeing a gorge of some sort, although none such was indicated on
our chart, which, by the way was pretty well undecipherable from
constant handling. But the creek ended, as it began, in dry sand;
it only formed a kind of channel to receive the scanty drainage
of the surrounding ridges, never enough to flow any distance.</p>

<p>Ned drew my attention before we left to the number of parrots
and pigeons who were coming in to water.</p>

<p>'No more about here, old man,' he said, 'or they would not
muster up in that fashion.'</p>

<p>'Well, we're all right,' I replied, 'we need not shift camp
from here until we know where we're going to.'</p>

<p>We rode according to the route marked on the chart, and in
seven or eight miles it landed us on the shoulder of a high
spinifex ridge. From there we could see nothing of any
consequence, and as the track marked on the chart took a sharp
turn to arrive at this object point we were naturally
surprised.</p>

<p>Vainly we looked around, no striking object of any sort was in
view, nothing tout rough mulga, spinifex, and stones.</p>

<p>'There's another plant in this,' said Ned, 'This here old
chart is as full of tricks as a monkey. Let's have a good look at
the thing?'</p>

<p>We looked, and were further mystified by observing that there
was a gap in the line of route marked. Evidently this point was
another little trap, and I began to see that the chart had been
for the sole benefit of the man who made it, and these gaps and
breaks were intended to put others off the scent if the chart was
lost. Evidently the maker of the chart depended on his memory at
these points, and I argued that there must be some striking
object in view.</p>

<p>Bearing this in mind. I looked most carefully all round, but
could see nothing in any way uncommon. Telling Ned to stop still,
I rode slowly up and down the ridge once, twice, thrice. Suddenly
I caught it&mdash;at least, I caught sight of what I was sure was
the guide mark.</p>

<p>On a ridge about a quarter of a mile away was a boulder, and
from one point which I passed I had suddenly caught sight of it
transformed into the semblance of a man's head. I shifted my
position and lost it. Only from the one place did the outline of
the rock lend itself to the illusion. The face was so grotesque
and absurd that I could not help laughing; and Ned came riding
up.</p>

<p>Ned was not in a good temper</p>

<p>'Blowed if I see anything to laugh at about here,' he said.
'The man who'd laugh in this sort of country would sing comic
songs at a funeral.'</p>

<p>I pointed out the rock to him, and at last he saw the
resemblance to the man's face.</p>

<p>'That must be it,' he agreed with me; 'let us ride over and
see the next move.'</p>

<p>'My turn now,' said Ned when we reached the boulder, and
dismounting: he climbed on top.</p>

<p>Standing up he gazed all round, rather disconsolately at
first, but presently he brightened up.</p>

<p>'Come up here,' he said, and I climbed up and stood beside
him.</p>

<p>'Do you think that's it?' he asked, and pointed to a belt of
black scrub.</p>

<p>I soon noticed what he meant. Through the scrub, visible only
from where we stood, was a clear track like a road, although, of
course, that was impossible. What it really was, was that the two
scrubs almost met, leaving but a small gap between them. This
from where we were looked like a cleared road. Seen from down
below the scrubs overlapped, and the space was not visible.</p>

<p>'Do you think that is the place?' asked Ned rather
doubtfully.</p>

<p>'Taking all things into consideration, I do. That had better
be our next dart, but it is no good going on to-day&mdash;
to-morrow will be time enough.'</p>

<p>We returned to camp, and entered on a more complete
examination of the chart than we had yet bestowed on it.</p>

<p>By means of a strong magnifying glass, which we carried for
prospecting purposes, we made out much more than we had formerly
found on it, so much had been half obliterated. In places there
were sentences written in a sort of crabbed round hand.</p>

<p>One ran: <i>'Here you will find the first fruits of your
toil</i>.'</p>

<p>'Shouldn't mind some fruit just now,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'What sort of fruit do you think he means?' said Ned, who had
not yet recovered his temper. 'Expect to get raspberries and
strawberries growing on the spinifex and oranges and peaches on
the mulga?'</p>

<p>'Now, we'll straighten it out,' I said, not heeding Ned's
sarcasm.</p>

<p>By means of a pocket compass and a makeshift protractor I
followed up the course. The maker had put no indications of the
cardinal points on his map, and I had to run it from laying out
the course we had already come. But the worst of it was, I had no
means of arriving at his scale of miles, as in all probability a
man who was so intent upon wrapping up his secret so that he
alone could unravel it would be likely to alter his scale so as
to bother one still more. When I had finished I made out that, if
the scale was the same all the way through, the end of our
journey, by many devious twists and turns, was about seventy-five
miles away, but the same point could be reached in about forty to
fifty miles by making straight across. This, however, considering
the eccentric character of the map, the nature of the country we
were in, and the general unreliability of everything, was too
rash an undertaking to contemplate.</p>

<p>'We're well off here,' said Ned, 'and we won't shift until we
know for certain where we are going to.'</p>

<p>This sentiment I duly endorsed. A couple of tender bronze-wing
pigeons, split open and broiled on the coals, had restored Ned's
temper, while the billy, bubbling alongside the fire with a stew
of parrots, rice, and preserved potatoes, nicely flavored, in it,
cooking for breakfast, made him feel content.</p>

<p>Next morning we were away pretty early.</p>

<p>Our camp and spare horses could be safely left to take care of
themselves, as we had not seen track or sign of a blackfellow,
either old or new, as yet; so we took Tommy with us, for three
pairs of eyes were better than two. We made straight for the gap
in the scrub that we had noticed, and were about entering it when
an exclamation from Tommy made us look round. He had been looking
back, and boulder on the ridge had caught his eye. No wonder he
called out. From the side we now were the ludicrous likeness to a
face was wonderful&mdash;a mocking face&mdash;the face of a
sardonic and spiteful old man.</p>

<p>'Looks from here as though he was laughing at us,' said
Ned.</p>

<p>'Perhaps he is,' I returned, as we started on again.</p>

<p>When we got out of the scrub the same dreary array of spinifex
ridges confronted us, the only change being that in the distance,
about fifteen miles away, there was a peak visible. I consulted
the map, and found that, according to my working of it, our track
should go to that peak or very near it In fact, it was at that
spot on the map that the writing occurred about 'first
fruits.'</p>

<p>'Tell you what, Ned, I said, 'I'll toss you who goes on to
that peak. The other can go back to camp, and bring out a horse
with the two big water bags on, and meet the one who goes
there?'</p>

<p>'I'm on,' said Ned. 'It's no good our taking all the horses
out there, and I bet there's no water.'</p>

<p>I had a coin in my saddle pouch, and we tossed and I won. Ned
looked disappointed.</p>

<p>'Never mind,' he said, 'I expect you will do better than I
should. I'll be here with the water, never fear. And if you don't
come back tonight?'</p>

<p>'Say to-morrow night, or to-morrow at twelve. Then you can
follow up,' I returned.</p>

<p>I had made a rough copy of the map, so I gave Ned the original
for safety. I collected all the food we had brought out for a
midday meal, took both water bags and Ned's cartridges and
started.</p>

<p>I had a good fresh horse, and one which I had lately shod, so
did not anticipate any difficulty. Bush riding by oneself is
always lonely, but riding through such lifeless country as that
was, is something more than lonely. During the fourteen or
fifteen miles to that peak, I never heard a sound or saw a living
creature, except a tiny lizard or some ants.</p>

<p>The approach to the peak was across a sandy plain, on which
loose boulders were scattered about. Out of this plain the peak
arose, bare, gaunt, and glistening with heat. It was a kind of
red rock, unlike the usual run of the solitary peaks of that
region, and I rode round it looking for an easy means of ascent,
for there was nothing about the foot of it worthy of notice,
while from the top I might see what was meant by the 'first
fruits,' or, at any rate, have an extended view ahead.</p>

<p>I soon found a pretty easy assent, and determined to take it.
Just opposite was a clump of dead saplings, and to one of these I
tied my horse, took the full waterbag off&mdash;I had emptied
one&mdash;and hung it on a tree. Then I started up the peak.</p>

<p>I suppose I must have been about halfway up, when I heard an
affrighted snort from my horse. I looked down. He, one of the
quietest of animals, was hanging back on his reins, his ears
cocked, snorting with terror, although I could see nothing.
Instantly the dread of being left to get back on foot flashed
across me. Calling to him so that he should recognise my voice, I
began hastily to descend.</p>

<p>As I did so a good-sized boulder, how detached I know not,
came bounding down from the top of the hill, and passed
perilously close to me. I got down somehow, but too late. The
dead branch to which my horse had been tied had broken, and he
was making his way campward along his outward track. I looked
carefully round but could see absolutely no sign of anything that
could have frightened my horse.</p>

<p>Suddenly a blind unreasoning fear assailed me. I had only one
desire, to get away from the presence of the peak. I could see
nothing, could hear nothing, but I felt the place was not good
for me. Congratulating myself, even in my flurry, on my
precaution in having taken the waterbag off the saddle, I took it
in my hand and started off back on the track.</p>

<p><br>
THAT walk back through the awful desolation of that country
was a nightmare that I remember still, and dream of at times.
Always I fancied that there was some threatening presence
following me up with dire intent. I could not help glancing
fearfully around now and again, as if it was possible there could
be any living thing in that dread, drear desert but myself. It
was horrible, this feeling of fright, which might overpower a man
under some strange circumstances at the dead hour of night, but
here, under the blazing sunshine, in was unnatural, and out of
all reason.</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown when I was hailed by a welcome shout
ahead, and I saw Ned breasting the rise, coming cantering towards
me, leading my runaway horse. What a change that human about in
that wilderness made in my feelings. At once I regained my nerve,
and the superstitious terror that had dogged my track vanished
like the quick passing of a fleeting shadow.</p>

<p>'Not hurt?' asked Ned anxiously, as he pulled up alongside of
me.</p>

<p>'No,' I answered; 'Jimba and I both got a fright about
nothing.'</p>

<p>It was with a thankful feeling of intense relief that I put my
foot in the stirrup again, and as we rode home, I told Ned all
about it.</p>

<p>'When you were half way up, what did the country already look
like?' he asked.</p>

<p>'I never looked: I blundered down the hill so fast to catch
Jimba before he got away, that I forgot all about it, and then
that gibber coming down upset me still further.'</p>

<p>'We'll make an early start,' said Ned, 'and take Tommy with us
to mind the nags while we go up the peak.'</p>

<p>To this I agreed, and a good feed when I got back to camp, and
a night's sleep, made me inclined to laugh at myself the next
morning, when, before the largest of the constellations had laded
out, we were on our way back to the mysterious peak.</p>

<p>We rode quickly, leaving Tommy to follow more slowly with the
pack horse. When we reached the peak, we rode carefully all round
it, looking for tracks, but with the exception of mine of the day
before, we could find nothing. We examined the stone that had
nearly capsized me, and found it weather-worn almost to the shape
of a globe; it may have been just ready to topple over, and by a
strange coincidence, had fallen at the very time when I was
ascending the hill. In fact, that must have been the case, for
there could be nobody human, at any rate, waiting at the top of
the peak to roll it down on the first comer. I felt none of the
strange terror I had felt the day before, the companionship of my
mate seemed quite sufficient to banish any superstitious feeling
of that sort.</p>

<p>On the arrival of Tommy, we commenced the ascent, leaving him
in a clear space, in full view of us. Slowly and carefully we
went up, hardly looking abroad, until at last we gained the top,
and both stood silently gazing around.</p>

<p>What did we see? In the immediate neighborhood the same dreary
desert, to which our track seemed now wedded; beyond, low ranges,
square-topped, and clothed for the greater part with black scrub,
showing mostly a precipitous face for the last hundred feet of
their summit. These, unpromising-looking ranges bounded our view
nearly all the way round, but when we came to look at right
angles to the course we had been following there was a depression
in the range, and it looked as though a creek formed in the basin
in which we then, were and found its way through this
depression.</p>

<p>At times we fancied we could trace here and there the timber
of a creek, but it was by no means a certainty, although we both
felt sure, from the lay of the surrounding country, that a creek
must exist. On consulting the map, we found that the track led in
that direction.</p>

<p>Ned pointed out to me the place whence the boulder had been
dislodged. A patch of fresh colored rock, different from the
weather-worn surface around. So small was it that the stone must
have been poised most delicately, right on the brow of a sloping
rock. The least tremor would have started it.</p>

<p>'It strikes me, Ned,' I said, 'that is the first fruits the
map speaks of.'</p>

<p>Ned nodded assent.</p>

<p>'We must keep our eyes open,' he replied. 'This old chart's
dangerous.'</p>

<p>It was now about noon, so we decided to send Tommy back to
camp, and take a short ride in the direction of the apparent
creek. Before descending we took another look round, but no sign
of life was visible, no smoke anywhere.</p>

<p>Tommy was glad to see us back again. He said that he felt
frightened, but he couldn't tell why.</p>

<p>'Horse frightened, too,' he said. 'Mine think it dead fellow
sit down here.'</p>

<p>'What for you think it dead fellow sit down here?' demanded
Ned.</p>

<p>'Baal mine know; only mine think it. Stone sit down there.' He
indicated a pile of stones a short distance away, which had
escaped my observation. We rode over, and looked at it. It
certainly looked like a grave. It was a pile about six feet long,
and three broad, and had been built up by human hands.</p>

<p>'Blackfellow do this?' asked Ned of Tommy.</p>

<p>'Baal blackfellow,' said Tommy, emphatically. 'White
fellow.'</p>

<p>We started to work putting the stones on one side. As we went
on we found that the hole, grave, or whatever it was, was filled
with stones; nor had we far to go, for it was evident that the
loose, shifting sand had not permitted the sexton to go very
deep.</p>

<p>In a short time a shrivelled body showed through the stones,
and, working hastily, we soon had it uncovered. The dry, hot sand
had reduced it to a mummy, but it had preserved the clothes and
hair. The body was that of a man of strong build, with a black
beard and black hair, most of which had, however, fallen off on
the blanket on which he was lying.</p>

<p>We examined the grave thoroughly to see if anything had been
buried with him which could give us a clue to his story, but
found nothing beyond the belt and pouch he had on, for he had
been buried in all his clothes; this we took for future
examination. What we did discover, however, was that the man had
not died a natural death, his skull being fractured just over the
left temple.</p>

<p>We filled the grave in again with the stones, and by that time
it was getting late and we started for camp. After tea we
examined the pouch. It contained a piece of tobacco, shrivelled
up like a withered stick, a pistol cartridge, and a well-worn
envelope containing two or three papers. We fell with eager
curiosity on these.</p>

<p>The first one we opened was a bill for £6 10s from the Blank
Hotel, Fremantle, and Ned, after turning it over and upside down,
put it aside with the remark that it was not receipted. The next
paper was a newspaper cutting, stuck upon a piece of note paper
with marginal notes in lead pencil.</p>

<p>This promised to be more interesting, and it was, The
newspaper cutting was to the effect that James Bornstock had
returned to the camp at Goram-Gerup, after a long prospecting
trip. He reported finding likely-looking country, but had
obtained no satisfactory results. He also reported the death of
his mate by thirst. This was what the printed matter contained;
the marginal annotations ran as follows:</p>

<p><i>'Bornstock's a liar. I must look him up.' </i></p>

<p>This with regard to getting no satisfactory results from the
country. Opposite the line about losing his mate was
scribbled:</p>

<p><i>'I must take a hand now, Bornstock won't come back without
me.'</i></p>

<p>'But he did,' put in Ned, as we finished, reading.</p>

<p>'Mr. Bornstock, whoever he was, seems to have been clever at
losing his mates,' I returned.</p>

<p>'Well, If Loony Jones killed him, it was only tit for tat,'
said Ned.</p>

<p>The next paper proved the most interesting of all to us. There
was a. circular mark drawn on it, and a straight line extending
from it some distance. Along this line was written, <i>'Keep
northeast; never mind rest</i>.'</p>

<p>'Does that round mark mean the peak?' said Ned.</p>

<p>'I should think so,' I answered, fanning out the Chart. 'What
is the bearings of that depression?'</p>

<p>'North-east.'</p>

<p>'Here are, then. The track makes a lone course to the
north-east, and then wanders about all roads.'</p>

<p>'Bravo and bully for us! but what a lot of lives this bit of
paper is accountable for?' and Ned touched the frayed old map.
'See; there's the unknown mate of Bornstock's; then the man whose
body we found; lastly, Bornstock himself; and only for a lucky
fluke you and I might have been added to the list.'</p>

<p>'Well, shall we chance it, and make a move to-morrow morning?'
asked Ned.</p>

<p>'Yes, there seems nothing else to do. We can always make back
here, and by going straight to that opening, instead of round to
the peak, we can cut off at least five or six miles.'</p>

<p>On that conclusion, we went to sleep, and next morning broke
camp, bag and baggage. As we approached the dip in the range, we
saw that a dry sandy creek did form, and assumed large
proportions as we went on, but the bed was hopelessly dry, and
looked as though it had been waterless for years. As we went on
the ranges closed in on us more than we had expected.</p>

<p>I stopped, and consulted the chart, and found that, according
to it, we should turn off at an angle that would bring us on to a
south-east course.</p>

<p>'Well, Ned,' I said, 'shall we follow the chart or the
creek?'</p>

<p>'The creek for me,' answered Ned; 'I'm sick of that puzzling
old chart; besides, I think from, the look of things that there
is going to be a change of scene directly.'</p>

<p>'Go ahead,' I returned, 'we can always turn back and follow up
the other course.'</p>

<p>In about half an hour a black reef of rocks was visible
stretching right across our track. The banks of the creek, too,
were now much shallower, and the creek was much wider. As we got
closer we could see that the reef crossed the creek and ran on to
the corresponding range on the outer side. It seemed an
impossible wall to take horses over. The bed of the creek was now
one clean-swept, smooth rock; no sand or any debris was
visible.</p>

<p>When we reached the rocky wall and dismounted, neither of us
spoke, and we mutually turned and went down to the bed of the
creek. It fell over a precipitous rock of about a hundred feet in
depth, and stretched before us was a lovely valley, bordered by
sharp-peaked ranges, some with red, rugged faces, glinting in the
sunlight&mdash;others covered with dark scrub.</p>

<p>The valley itself, although of no great size, was evidently
well-grassed, and free from the odious spinifex. Plains separated
by belts of scrub lay before us, and through it all wound the
creek, now apparently well-watered, for the trees in the bed and
on the bank were green and densely foliaged. Parrots were
swarming everywhere, and their noisy chattering rose even to
where we were standing. We could see flocks of white corellas,
slate-colored galahs, black cockatoos, and others flitting about,
shrieking and scolding.</p>

<p>Ned advanced to the edge, and looked over, then he called to
me. Below at the foot of the smooth rock was a deep, dark
waterhole, formed by the rare floods that now and again swept
down the creek.</p>

<p>I drew Ned back, for the rock was as slippery as glass, and an
unwilling plunge down was not advisable. To get the horses down
was the next trouble, and it was only after some hours that we
managed to find an available break over the wall-like reef, and a
descent the other side. At last we were safe down, and soon had
fixed up a comfortable camp.</p>

<p>'It must have been a long time since the interesting Mr.
Bornstock's visits to these parts,' I remarked to Ned. 'We have
not seen the ghost of a track yet.'</p>

<p>'That dead man was a pretty plain track,' said Ned; 'but I
wonder there is not some sort of an available track up and down
this wall.'</p>

<p>'I don't, it would have betrayed him at once, probably he went
up and down a different way every time.'</p>

<p>'Well, anyhow, we had better go over this valley now we are
here. There's an hour or two of sun yet. Shall we ride down, the
creek a mile or two?'</p>

<p>I assented, and we caught our horses and started. The creek
was well watered with shallow pools, fringed in places with a
growth of rushes. Ducks flew up as we approached, and
occasionally a lonely jabiru rose hastily in affright.</p>

<p>'How is it there are no niggers about?' I said.</p>

<p>'I can't make it out. I've seen one or two very old camps, but
that is all,' answered Ned. 'One should think this place would be
a paradise for them.'</p>

<p>I assented, and as it was getting late we turned back.</p>

<p>Half-way to camp we came across Tommy making along our tracks.
He was terribly frightened, and begged us not to camp where we
were that night. It seems that noticing a good many wallabies
amongst the rocks, he had gone along the wall to try and get a
shot at one, and in about half a mile had come upon a scene which
had frightened the life out of him. We went out to look at
it.</p>

<p>From twenty to thirty bodies of natives, half mummies, half
skeletons, lay there. A hideous massacre had been perpetrated at
some time, and men and women and children had been rounded up
against the face of the rocky wall and shot down. It was the most
ghastly sight Ned or I had ever seen, and we gazed in horror at
it. There was no mistake that it was the hands of some murderous
whites which had done the deed, for many of the skulls had
unmistakable bullet holes in them.</p>

<p>'Some of Mr. Bornstock's work?' Queried Ned.</p>

<p>'Yes, and that other man's. Don't you see, he must have been
here with Bornstock to be able to write those directions. He
helped him to slaughter these poor devils, and then when
Bornstock got rid of him, why he killed two birds with one stone.
Got rid of a witness and of a man who knew his secret.'</p>

<p>'That's it,' said Ned. 'Loony Jones would have made another if
he had come out this far, but he must have killed Bornstock
before he got to the marked tree, and, of course, couldn't pick
up the trail.' We had dismounted, and were looking at the poor
wretches around us. Ned turned over a rotting dilly bag with his
foot. The contents rolled out, and we saw the gleam of gold
amongst it.</p>

<p>Picking it up it proved to be a good-sized specimen containing
more than an ounce of gold.</p>

<p>'We are close to It,' said Ned.</p>

<p>'Yes, but I'm sick of the whole thing. It reeks with blood.
How many more shall we find?'</p>

<p>'There's a good moon, suppose we bury these remains to-night;
it's more than I'd do for Bornstock if we found him.'</p>

<p>I agreed, and by the light of a nearly full moon we dug a hole
large enough to contain the wretched remains of the massacre, and
put them mercifully out of sight.</p>

<p>We slept sound after our work, and next morning started early,
both feeling that we had about come to the end of our trip. Five
miles down the creek we came on to auriferous country and some
old workings in a gully leading down from one of the ranges, the
first sign, beyond the dead bodies, that we had yet seen of the
white man's former presence.</p>

<p>For more than a fortnight we prospected that place
industriously, but, beyond the merest show, we obtained nothing.
The auriferous belt was small, and dwindled off higher up the
range, and was overlaid by the desert formation.</p>

<p>We tried the old workings, and got a little shotty gold that
had been left behind, but the extent of the work that had been
done, and the way it had been followed, it was evident that the
former prospectors had struck a patch, and worked it out for all
it was worth. We tried some of the dirt left on the bank, and got
a little gold out of that; then we decided to give It up and
return.</p>

<p>I had an idea of taking up the country and selling it for
pastoral purposes; that, with the little gold we had got, would
give us something over our expenses.</p>

<p>'I wonder what Bornstock did with the gold?' said Ned the
night before we started back, 'and why he brought men as mates
out here?'</p>

<p>'He must have been threatened by the blacks when by himself,
and wanted company, and help.'</p>

<p>'I suppose so,' answered Ned, 'anyhow, I don't think that he
took the gold into Goran Gerup, He planted it somewhere, and I
guess I know where.'</p>

<p>Ned turned his back defiantly to me, and would say no more.
Next morning he said he wanted to go round by the peak, and we
went round.</p>

<p>'Now, old man, we are going to open that grave again.'</p>

<p>I started, and Ned's idea flashed across me at once, and we
set to work; The corpse lay there as we had left it, only,
perhaps from being exposed to the air, it seemed to have, shrunk
up more.</p>

<p>'I wonder if the blanket will bold to lift him out; he's light
enough, poor devil,' said Ned. We tried, and lifted the body out
with ease. Underneath was another one!</p>

<p>'This is a family vault,' said Ned. 'This must be mate No. 1.
But he must come out.' He was more of a skeleton than the other,
and he was soon deposited on the brink of the grave. Then we
searched.</p>

<p>The gold was there, underneath the two murdered men.
Altogether it finally gave us about £5000 each. We put the dead
men back, packed our treasure, and started, vowing never to
revisit the spot.</p>

<p>On our way back, after passing the tree marked 'climb,' we
kept a sharp lookout for the scene of the tragedy in which Loony
Jones must have had a hand; but we did not find it.</p>

<p>Bornstock, the murderer; and probable a madman, is the only
one whose bones lie somewhere&mdash;unburied, picked by crow and
dingo.</p>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>15. &mdash; FEY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 17 Oct 1896</h3>

<p class="first">THE shadows were growing long as the hot sun of
the west sank behind the trees that scantily lined the banks of
the inland river; cutting, like a great, serpentine ditch,
through the level, sloping downs of the Australian interior. The
river, in spite of its imposing breadth of bed, was dry for
miles, and the long, dusty cattle pads trailed in to the
far-apart water-holes, radiating from all parts of the
compass.</p>

<p>Along one of these, raising a white cloud which powdered
themselves, their saddles, and their horses indiscriminately,
rode two men, while behind them jingled a couple of pack-horses
driven by a black boy, whose face, greasy with sweat, was
powdered white with dust on the projecting portions.</p>

<p>'Thank goodness, we'll be in to the Ten-mile in time for a
swim,' said one of them, whose light blue eyes shone brightly out
of his swarthy face.</p>

<p>'Yes; I don't know how many of the proverbial pecks of dust we
swallow every summer up here. I could grow corn on my
saddle-cloth.'</p>

<p>It was not long, before the Ten-mile Waterhole was reached,
and men and horses were soon enjoying the rare luxury of a
satisfying drink and bath in moderately cold water, for the
Ten-mile was a noted hole for depth and length, and a dive deep
down took one into a refreshing stratum of cool, shimmering
obscurity.</p>

<p>Invigorated, the men sat down to their meal as the early stars
were beginning to make themselves visible, and then the grateful
scent of tobacco mingled with that of burning wood went up as an
incense offering to the silent night.</p>

<p>Mertel, the man with the light blue eyes, was aroused from
deep slumber by his companion shaking him. The night was well
advanced, the still surface of the pool reflected the stars
without a ripple causing them to move, and all was still.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' he asked.</p>

<p>Pierse, the other man, drew his attention to a light at the
end of the hole, about a quarter of a mile distant. It was but a
flicker of light, and Mertel suggested that it was a smouldering
log, left burning by some former traveller.</p>

<p>'I'm going up to see; you keep a look-out till I come back. It
was here those two men were killed by the natives six months
ago.'</p>

<p>'The niggers wouldn't light a fire up there if they meant to
be saucy,' said Mertel.</p>

<p>'No, I suppose not; at any rate, I want to see what's there,
for I feel sure there is something.'</p>

<p>'Well, I should wait till morning, if I were you.'</p>

<p>Pierse made no answer, but disappeared in the darkness; and
Mertel lit his pipe with an ember from the dying fire, and lay
down on his blanket again.</p>

<p>His companion made his way as cautiously as he could along the
edge of the waterhole, until close to the glint of fire. Going
near softly and silently, revolver in hand, he stopped once more
and listened. All was silent, and step by step he advanced until
he stood close by the red embers. It was the smouldering end of a
log, and Pierse was about to turn back to his camp when he
noticed that something seemed to be toasting on the live
coals.</p>

<p>Stooping down, he saw that it was the edible seed pods of the
water lily, a food used by the natives.</p>

<p>A noise in the water aroused his attention. He turned, and in
the faint starlight saw a glistening black object like a head oh
the surface. It rose up at the edge, and the owner of it was
coming towards the fire, when, catching sight of the unexpected
guest, it gave a harsh, inarticulate cry, and plunged with a
splash back in the water.</p>

<p>From the hasty and indistinct glance Pierse had caught, the
object appeared to be a young black, but that was all he saw,
and, confounding his folly in not keeping out of sight, he
returned to his camp.</p>

<p>Riding round the next morning the men saw by daylight that the
camp had been a white man's, some weeks old, during which time
the log had been slowly smouldering away.</p>

<p>The lily pods had disappeared, and the tracks in the ashes
showed the imprint of a small foot only.</p>

<p>'No good looking for him or it,' said Mertel. 'The young
devil's watching us from somewhere, but what can the creature be
doing here all by itself?'</p>

<p>'Hanged if I know. I've a good mind to stop to-night, and lay
a trap of some sort for it.'</p>

<p>'Pooh! A nice job to stop roasting here all day on the chance
of catching a young nigger; not quite.'</p>

<p>Mertel turned his horse to ride off as he spoke, and Pierse
reluctantly followed him.</p>

<p>'I never heard a human being make such a queer noise before,'
he said.</p>

<p>Several times on their way home to the station he reverted to
it, and talked and chattered in a way quite unusual with a man of
his generally taciturn nature. The station was some ten miles
from the waterhole, as the name indicated, and Mertel thought he
had never seen his friend in such good spirits before as he was
on that homeward ride.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Pierse went down to the small camp of quiet
blacks who had found their way in to the station, and had a long
confab with one of the old men there.</p>

<p>'I'm going to the Ten-mile to-morrow,' he said to Mertel, as
they sat at their evening meal, 'will you come?'</p>

<p>'Not I,' was the answer. 'Get some of the blacks to go with
you.'</p>

<p>'They wouldn't come for anything I can offer them. That's the
queer thing about it.'</p>

<p>'Because of that murder there. Most blacks are like that.'</p>

<p>'No. I don't think that's the reason, but I'll find out before
I return.'</p>

<p>Towards evening Pierse left on his errand, having provided
himself with a couple of days' rations, in case his pursuit was
not successful the first night He arrived at the hole after dark,
and proceeded to make his preparations, which mostly consisted in
getting a safe place of espionage on the still smouldering
log.</p>

<p>It was a long watch. The belt was right overhead and the cross
upright in the south, when he saw a dark, silent shadow raking
the coals together. They flickered and blazed a little, giving to
view a queer, elfish figure, with brilliant black eyes. Miserably
thin and attenuated, with arms and legs of wonderful slenderness,
the creature, a native girl, crouched over the fire, more, as it
would seem, for company than warmth, for the night was still and
sultry.</p>

<p>Pierse watched this being, wondering how it came to be there,
for blacks never neglect their children, although they might eat
them occasionally.</p>

<p>Presently the girl got up, and going to the edge of the water
slipped quietly in and disappeared.</p>

<p>Here was another surprise, for blacks, as a rule, do not move
about much at night, and certainly do not go hunting around for
their food during the dark hours.</p>

<p>Pierse waited patiently, and in due course the dripping wet
figure rose from the water, and coming to the fire, commenced to
peel and prepare the pods it had been collecting. Now was
Pierse's chance, and while the girl's attention was thus
occupied, he sprang upon her and seized her.</p>

<p>He had not expected any opposition, but the thing fought and
twisted and wriggled, making no sound beyond the indistinct and
half-human-like cry it had given vent to before. At last he
managed to tie the Slippery, eel-like object fast with the halter
from the packhorse which he had brought with him.</p>

<p>At the last moment, watching an opportunity, the captive
suddenly seized Pierce's left hand with its teeth, and inflicted
a savage bite that brought an oath of pain from his lips.</p>

<p>After that the girl remained quiet, and made no more efforts
to get free. Pierse washed and bound up the wound with the
handkerchief from around his neck; and then set himself to
conciliate his captive in the way that is generally most
successful, namely by feeding her. It was some time before he
could get her to take any food, although she was evidently
starving; but little by little she took and tasted, and at last
ate ravenously.</p>

<p>At daylight he started back with his prize, who now seemed
reconciled to her fate, and trotted easily along at the slow pace
he went at; but no word or sound had she uttered, save the
strange cry made when struggling for her freedom.</p>

<p>Their way lay past the blacks' camp, and those who were still
there greeted Pierse and his prisoner with loud cries, that soon
grew violent. The old gins especially raged and spat at the girl,
and waved their skinny arms aloft as though warning her off their
encampment. Pierse cracked his whip, and made as though he was
going to use it on them, and the clamor stilled, and the two went
on to the principal hut, for the buildings were little more.</p>

<p>'Very strange thing about those blacks going on like that,'
said Mertel, when Pierse had finished his yarn. 'I wonder what's
the matter with the girl that she should be hunted out like
that?'</p>

<p>'I don't know. It's a thing I never heard of before; but then
they all have different customs. I've sent Fred down to try and
find out what it means.'</p>

<p>Fred, the black boy, soon returned, and related what he had
found out The girl was dumb, and, on account of some fancied evil
resulting from her presence in the tribe, had been cast out by
them to starve.</p>

<p>Pierse then remembered that the strange, animal-like cry was
the unnatural sound of pain or terror usually made by the deaf
mute.</p>

<p>'Old man say some pella white pella tumble down along a
station now that one come up,' added Fred.</p>

<p>'Oh, we'll chance all that,' said Pierse. 'You go and tell
those old gins, Fred, that if one of them touches the girl I'll
break her skull with her own yam stick.'</p>

<p>The child seemed to perceive at once that she was going to be
well treated, and employed herself during the ensuing four and
twenty hours in satisfying her enormous appetite.</p>

<p>She was seemingly about eleven or twelve years old, and
possessed a bright, intelligent face, with remarkably keen eyes,
always on the watch, which acuteness was rendered necessary by
her want of hearing.</p>

<p>Pierse doctored his hand up with such simple remedies as they
possessed on the station. The bite had been a good, vicious, and
vigorous one, and Mertel wanted him to go in to the nearest
township and have it properly dressed. But he only laughed at him
and went to work as usual. At the end of a week of blistering hot
weather he put his hand in a sling, and complained that it
throbbed so at night that he could not sleep.</p>

<p>One morning when seated at breakfast he suddenly stared hard
and fixedly at his friend, but without speaking.</p>

<p>'What the devil's the matter?' asked Mertel. Pierse gave a
sort of snarl, then drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p>'I couldn't open my mouth,' he said. 'My jaw seemed to get
set.'</p>

<p>Two or three times in the course of the morning this
happened.</p>

<p>'Tom!' said Mertel to the stockman, a lean, hard specimen of
the western man. 'How long will it take you to get in to the
crossing and bring that doctor out?'</p>

<p>'Two days and nights.'</p>

<p>'Take any two horses you fancy best and start at once. I'll
send a letter by you.'</p>

<p>'S'posing he's drunk, as he generally is?' remarked Tom as he
took his bridle down from the peg.</p>

<p>'Bring him, drunk or sober. Strap him on and bring a bottle or
two with you to keep him going.'</p>

<p>Tom whistled&mdash;he was not a man of many words. When he was
ready Mertel gave him a letter.</p>

<p>'He'll have a bag with him, Tom; see that he brings it.'</p>

<p>Tom nodded, swung himself into the saddle, and with the led
horse jogging alongside of him rode off on the dusty road, across
the big plain.</p>

<p>Mertel turned into the hut; Pierse was laughing strangely.</p>

<p>'Just had another of those queer contractions of the jaw.
Feels deuced rum, when a fellow can't open his mouth,' and again
he laughed mirthlessly.</p>

<p>All through the hot day he roamed about now complaining of his
hand and arm, now laughing and grinning in a way that made Mertel
feel cold, although in the verandah it was one hundred and
fifteen by the thermometer.</p>

<p>The little black mute watched the man from a corner, or
followed him about at a little distance. Whether she knew what
was wrong, and that it was her doing, Mertel could not tell, but
he thought so. As night came on the paroxysms of pain became
worse, and the arm was angry and red to the shoulder.</p>

<p>Mertel could only sit with him and pray that Tom would return
speedily. So the night dragged on, and in the morning Pierse
could not speak, and could only look imploringly at his friend;
but the pain had left him, and his arm was swollen and numb.</p>

<p>Mertel, looking at it, could only mutter to himself that it
was too late, and that if all the doctors in Australia were there
to amputate the poisoned limb it was too late.</p>

<p>The sun was setting when Pierse died in dumb agony, and Mertel
composed the pain-contorted face and straightened the late strong
limbs. A black shadow came in noiselessly and stood beside him as
he did it. The deaf mute, the outcast, stood there and looked
with curious eyes of awe and wonder at the dead.</p>

<p>She timidly put out her hand and touched the body, then glided
out again.</p>

<p>Midnight, and two men riding across the plain, heard the
natives wailing in their camp after their childish manner, and
Tom knew at once that death had beaten him, well as he had
sped.</p>

<p>The stiff, tired, and half-asleep doctor tumbled off his horse
at the verandah. Up to the day when whisky won the fight with him
in the end, he never forgot that ride, without break or pause,
over the endless and monotonous downs, with the silent tireless
figure like fate beside him.</p>

<p>Deaf to all his entreaties to stop, if only for an hour.
Doling him out occasional nips of whisky, as though he was a
machine that required recharging. He limped up to the bed and
looked at the dead man.</p>

<p>'I could have done nothing, I'm afraid,' he said hoarsely to
Mertel. 'Never have had the nerve to take his arm off; look how
my hand shakes,' and he threw himself on Mertel's bed and went
off into a heavy sleep.</p>

<p><br>
THEY buried Pierse at dawn, and the deaf and dumb girl watched
with the same eyes of awe and wonder. An hour or two afterwards
the doctor woke up and went bunking out on to the verandah.
Mertel was standing looking around as though searching, for
something.</p>

<p>'Tom,' he called across to the gaunt stockman, who was
standing smoking under the verandah of his hut, as though a
hundred miles in the saddle without break or spell was mere
child's play. 'Can you see the little nigger about anywhere?'</p>

<p>Tom answered in the negative, as he strolled across.</p>

<p>The heat haze was beginning to shimmer and tremble around the
horizon, and shrouded from view a black speck speeding away from
the station, never seen more.</p>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>16. &mdash; THE LOST GULLY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 5 and 12 Aug
1899</h3>

<p class="first">THE Macdonnell Ranges, in Central Australia, are
noted for their complicated formation. The ravines and gullies
running from them, if followed, lead you, after many devious
twists and turns, in the very opposite direction to the one they
apparently started to follow.</p>

<p>At the time the overland line was being constructed many tales
circulated amongst the men concerning rich deposits to be found
amongst the fastnesses of these ranges, mostly arising from the
fact that, when digging the holes for the poles, occasionally,
washdirt had been found, which yielded a few colors of gold.</p>

<p>Gradually these yarns concentrated themselves into one, and
that told of a wondrous gully situated in the maze of the great
belt of ranges that spread from east to west across the heart of
Australia. This gully was said to be held in dread by the
natives, who only at times peeped fearfully into it from the
crests of the neighboring ridges.</p>

<p>As usual, as years went on, the story of this hidden gully
grew and grew, until at last a tale was brought in by one man,
which seemed to give some definite form and substance. Coming in
alone from one of the newly-formed stations to the westward, he
met with an accident in the ranges, and lamed his horse and
himself. Fortunately, some quiet blacks came across him, and took
care of him, and looked after his two horses for a day or two,
till he could hobble about. He asked them about the gully, and
one old fellow said he would take him to a ridge overlooking the
mysterious gully, if he would go by night.</p>

<p>Urged on by curiosity, he consented, and, as one of his horses
was uninjured, he rode out one might, accompanied by five or six
of the natives. They travelled the best part of the night, and
then camped at a waterhole in a gorge, where the blacks insisted
on staying nearly the whole of the next day. Towards evening they
led him up a high ridge, the opposite side of which was
precipitous, and from there he could see the gully below him.</p>

<p>It was broad, with a watercourse running down the centre,
fringed with a growth of young trees. But the rest of the country
visible was distinguished for an absence of any timber at all.
One remarkable feature was, what seemed like a number of pillars
of stone, dotted about here and there, also what looked like low
walls, also made of stone. Beyond this he could make out nothing,
and the blacks were uneasy and anxious to get away, so, as the
sun went down, he turned back from the gully, determined to
search for it another time.</p>

<p>But that time never came, for an unfortunate accident ended
his life before he had a chance to put his intention into
execution Then others took up the search, but none found the
gully with the strange pillars and walls of stone, and the blacks
grew suspicious, and denied all knowledge of its whereabouts.</p>

<p>One man became noted for the pertinacity with which he sought
after the lost gully. Three or four times he had been in danger
of his life from the blacks, who were not all well-disposed; but
nothing would deter him from the quest, neither hunger nor
thirst, nor the spears of the savages; and as years went on he
grew grey, and lean and sullen, and when, he came in to procure
rations, the men on the telegraph line and on the stations spoke
of him amongst themselves as cranky Jennings.</p>

<p>He made enough fossicking about to keep himself going in
rations, and as soon as he had a month or two's supply he would
go out again on his everlasting wandering, until at last he
disappeared, and men soon forgot him.</p>

<p> THE twilight was closing in rapidly, hastened by a dense
black cloud that was quickly spreading over the sky, foretelling
a night of storm, of thunder and lightning, when Jennings picked
his way carefully along a boulder-strewn ridge. Down in the gully
below darkness had already set in under the shadow of the looming
storm. Looking round in the dusk, Jennings espied a place where
two or three great rocks were piled up in such a way as to form a
rude cave. He made for this, and unsaddled and unpacked his
horses. Then, before the storm burst, got in a supply of dry
wood, and made himself as comfortable as circumstances
permitted.</p>

<p>The storm crept over the sky with a constant low mutter of
distant thunder, which seemed to rumble all round the horizon,
but there was no rain, until, in more than an hour's time, there
was suddenly a flash that seemed to rend the heavens in all
directions, and with it a peal of thunder which sounded as if the
great granite hills all around were shaken and rocking to their
foundations.</p>

<p>Then the rain came down in a terrific downpour, and black
darkness settled down once more.</p>

<p>Jennings had started to his feet after the flash, for he had
seen something in the white light of the flash that made his
heart beat. Another flash flooded the gully below him with a
searching, brilliant illumination, and showed him a sight that
made him shout with wonder and joy.</p>

<p>As long as the storm lasted he stood there, watching the
wondrous sight that the blazing lightning revealed to him, until
at last his strained brain gave way, and he fell unconscious. He
had seen the lost gully by the light of the lightning; but the
stone pillars now supported a colonnade round a large square
building, and the stone walls turned out to be the walls of a
fortification of some sort. Then, whether it was the bewildering
glow of the quick-flashing lightning or not, these buildings had
seemed to stagger and collapse as though an earthquake was
shaking them into ruin; and in the intervals, of the pealing
thunder he heard the clamor of a trumpet sounding a note of wild
terror and alarm. Then another flash showed him a swirling flood
of water rushing down the valley and submerging all
things&mdash;and then, a blank.</p>

<p>When Jennings woke the sun was shining brightly, every rivulet
and channel was singing with running water, and the atmosphere
was full of the refreshing scent which fills the early morning
air after rain.</p>

<p>He looked down the gully. Yes; as the man who first saw it had
reported it, he saw the rocky pillars and low, rocky walls, but
no trace of the vision of buildings that the flashing lightning
had revealed to him.</p>

<p>Long solitude and constant brooding over one object had
somewhat weakened his brain, and he did not regard what he had
seen, or fancied he had seen, as anything out of the ordinary
course of nature. He made his tea, and ate his breakfast, then
went after his horses, packed up and sought out a place to
descend into the valley. To do this he had to follow it some
distance towards its head, and even then he had much difficulty
in getting down.</p>

<p>The bed of the gully was covered with long lush grass, a
singular sight to see amongst the arid ranges of the interior.
The creek at the bottom of the gully was running strong after the
rain, but it was well within its banks, and Jennings soon arrived
at the stone pillars and what appeared to be rude walls; but they
were so weather-beaten that it was hard to say whether they were
some fantastic work of nature or some ancient work of human
hands.</p>

<p>Beyond them the gully closed in with high cliffs such as are
common in some parts of the Macdonnell Ranges. In the middle of
this narrow part Jennings happened to look back, and then he saw
these rocks or ruins under quite a different aspect. They now
appeared to be the pillars and walls of an ancient gateway built
across the narrow way, for two of these pillars were on one side
of the creek, two on the other, and the remains of the seeming
wall fitted in to their places at the sides of each. This effect
was not so noticeable from up stream as it was down below the
singular ruins or natural formation, whichever it was.</p>

<p>But the sight that greeted him when he came to the lower
mouth of the narrow pass was one to make him exclaim with wonder.
The gully widened out into a large open basin, almost treeless,
save for the growth that fringed the watercourse on either bank.
Scattered about this basin, which was surrounded by low cliffs,
were mounds of rock, of the same construction as the gate-like
erections he had passed in the narrow defile.</p>

<p>But the strangest sight of all was the number of animals and
birds about, all without any fear of man, and apparently dreading
no danger from him. Jennings rode on, past kangaroos of all
kinds, who simply lifted their heads from the grass and gazed at
him with a look of mild surprise. Emus ran close up to him, and
inspected him curiously; and the creek, which here broadened out
into a string of broad lagoons, was covered with aquatic birds of
every kind.</p>

<p>What marvellous superstition had kept the native hunters out
of this veritable animal paradise? And what had kept the
kangaroos down, so that they had not increased, in such numbers
as to be forced to overrun the limits of the valley?</p>

<p>Jennings rode on until he came to the ruins, and, dismounting,
proceeded to examine them. Wind, weather, and water had worked
their will on them, and, even as the others, one could scarcely
tell what age or what nature they were. But when Jennings
remembered his strange vision, he recognised that the contour and
outline of the stones and rocks nearly resembled that of the
massive buildings he had seen in the night.</p>

<p>He rode on to the end of the basin, and found that the creek
here forced its way through a narrow, impassable gorge. Strewn on
the rocks and jammed in different crevices he saw numerous
skeletons and bones. On examination they turned out to be the
bones of kangaroos, etc. This accounted for the basin not
becoming overstocked, as periodically big floods must occur, and
most of its animal population be swept down the gorge to
destruction.</p>

<p>Jennings turned back, and went to the creek as close to the
ruins as he could get, and there camped. From the absence of
timber he was forced to make frig camp at the creek. He made a
meal, and then strolled over to the rocky mounds. All that
afternoon he pried and peered about them, and at sundown had made
up his mind as to his course of action. He was convinced that
they were of human agency.</p>

<p>Tired and wearied, he slept that night the sleep of
exhaustion; but in spite of all, he woke in the middle of the
night, aroused by the sound of voices.</p>

<p>He gazed upwards. The sky was calm and serene. The southern
constellations burned bright in a cloudless heaven, all was now
silent, but as he arose on his elbow to look around, he was
suddenly seized from behind and pressed down on his blankets
again.</p>

<p><br>
THAT they were human hands that thus pressed him backwards,
Jenkins knew by the feel of them; but he did not see who it was
who had thrown him down for his blanket was immediately muffled
across his face, and he found himself blindfolded, bound, and
helpless before he could make a sign of resistance.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances he thought it better to remain
motionless, as any sort of resistance was so quite out of the
question. He was picked up, seemingly by strong hands, and
carried away. No word was spoken by his captors, and the only
consolation he had was that he was treated gently, and not
handled in a manner which would show that he was intended for a
cannibal feast.</p>

<p>After a while he was set on his feet; and, apparently, two men
grasped his arms to either side, and by propelling him gently but
firmly forward, indicated that he must walk the rest of the
distance.</p>

<p>This change was a relief, and Jenkins willingly toiled on for
an hour or two. Of course he had spoken, but receiving no answer
had afterwards remained silent, rightly guessing that his captors
did not understand him my more than he would understand them.</p>

<p>The end came at last, and to his astonishment he found himself
still muffled and in darkness, deposited on a soft yielding
couch. A drinking utensil of some sort was put to his lips, and,
reckless of consequences, he drank what it contained, a pleasant,
sweet-tasting liquor. The effect was potent, for he remembered
nothing sure until he awoke to light and reason once again.</p>

<p>He found himself in a stone-walled room, lying on a bed and
covered with a soft covering of skins. Skins were everywhere,
covering the door and hanging on the walls. The bright sunlight
was glowing through the windows, and everything seemed peaceful
and still. Presently his eye was caught by what seemed a picture,
a rude scrawl executed on skin, but evidently intended to mean
the Madonna. It gave him wonderful comfort to see this. Whoever
it was had him in thrall, it was evidently people of some sort of
civilisation.</p>

<p>He got up from his bed and moved about, thinking naturally
that it would arouse the attention of his gaolers. He was not
disappointed, for a clumsy door opened, and a man of large
stature entered. He regarded the captive for a while, and then
spoke to someone outside the door, who brought in food and drink,
which Jenkins saw that he was expected to dispose of. He did so
the while the big man, who was dressed in skins, watched him.
This man was not very dark, but yet was swarthy enough to
indicate that he was not of pure European descent.</p>

<p>His meal finished, the man beckoned to him, and made him to
understand that he was to hollow him. Jenkins did so, and the man
led him through a passage into a room, which was furnished with
bare, roughly-made furniture. In it was an old, old man seated in
a chair, and one or two others of the same stature as his guide
waiting about. The guide motioned him to come close to the old
man, and then he saw that he was blind. The old man put his
wasted hands on the newcomer's face, and felt his features all
over; then he gave a sigh of satisfaction and leaned back in his
chair. He spoke in a language unknown to Jenkins, and one of the
men went out and brought back a parchment, which he gave to
Jenkins.</p>

<p>To his surprise, it was an English, and proved to be a royal
commission issued to one James Dirkman, authorising him to harry
and annoy the king's enemies, wheresoever he should meet them by
sea or land. More marvellous still, the signature was James
Rex.</p>

<p>After he had looked at the man who had brought it put into his
hand another paper closely written in a crabbed, upright hand,
Jenkins understood he was expected to read it, and as it would
occupy some time, he sat down on one of the rude chairs to do so,
it ran:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">To my son, and son's descendants,</p>

<p class="letter">
I, Captain James Dirkman fled from England in order to
save my royal master, King James. I suppose that my name has been
branded as that of a coward and traitor; but I leave this to tell
the truth to my descendants. It was when I accompanied the
English fleet in my barque, the Adventurer, that I received a
message from the Duke of York, commanding the fleet, to go on
board his ship. I went, and I now tell what passed. I resembled
his Grace greatly in height and complexion, and the Duke told me
in confidence that his nerves were unequal to stand the strain of
the impending engagement with the Dutch vessels. In short, would
I take his part. I consented, and he gave me his dress and full
instructions, and the Duke went out of the cabin as Captain,
Dirkman, and I remained. We won the battle, and the
'Adventurer,' my own barque, fled in a cowardly manner from
the scene of conflict, and I won the fight under the guise of the
Duke Of York.</p>

<p class="letter">
What was my reward? On our triumphal return to England, and
the necessary change had been effected, I was cast off by his
Grace, and told that I would be treated as a madman if I asserted
my claims to his gratitude. I had to submit, and in course of
time his Grace came to the throne, and then I received another
commission, and an intimation that I had better leave England at
once, and never return.</p>

<p class="letter">
There was no fighting against it. I left, and wandered over
the world, and came to this land. My crew were sick and dying of
scurvy, and my good ship had become only a floating lazar house.
I landed, and we, the poor survivors, formed an encampment on the
beach, and one by one died off, until at last I was left alone. I
know not how many years it was before a man came to the
beach&mdash;the natives had always kept aloof. He was a
dark-faced man, of great stature. When first I saw him he was
looking at the bare ribs of my poor barque, and turned to me with
a savage gesture, as if I was to blame for it being a stranded
wreck, and not a staunch craft as of old.</p>

<p class="letter">
He spoke in Spanish, a language which I could partly understand.</p>

<p class="letter">'
You come,' he said, 'from beyond seas; so do I. I had
hoped to return, but now I know that it is hopeless; those who
come to these shores never return.'</p>

<p class="letter">
That shipwrecked Spaniard and I wandered over this desolate
land, until we found the strange people living in this valley,
who are a remnant of those lost tribes who have not yet been
traced in the world's history. Here we married wives, and settled
down to live our outcast lives out. There is an old prophesy
about these people that they will be destroyed by flood in years
to come, but I leave this account with my children, to prove that
I, Captain James Dirkman, did not sail away in the
'Adventurer,' but stayed, and won the great battle over the
Dutch fleet. And I charge my descendants 'to show this to the
first European man who visits them.'</p>

<p>Here the scroll ended. Jenkins afterwards found that he would
not be allowed to leave the hidden gully on account of some
superstition that connected his arrival with the disaster of
flood that was to come.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN, years afterwards, the disappearance of Jenkins had been
forgotten, an old white-haired man appeared at Alice Springs
telegraph station, and told a strange story of how he had been
living with a tribe in the interior, and they had all perished in
a sudden inundation. He was looked upon as a harmless lunatic,
and remained a pensioner at the place until he died.</p>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>17. &mdash; A GHOSTLY TRYST</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 25 Aug 1900</h3>

<p class="first">IT was not without some feeling of nervousness
that young Mivert took up his position in Hangman's Gully to
carry out his boast of watching there all night; and interviewing
the ghost who was said to appear there with unfailing regularity.
He had extorted a solemn promise from his companions on the
station that they were to play no tricks on him. It was to be a
fair thing between the real ghost, if there was one, and himself,
without the interference of any sham ghosts.</p>

<p>Hangman's Gully had a peculiarly evil reputation. First, it
got its name from a famous massacre of blacks in the olden days,
when some convicts had by way of diversion, hanged some natives
from the projecting bough of a huge gum-tree that grew there. The
tree was still alive, but the long straight bough stuck out at an
angle, blasted and withered, and many people wondered that it had
not fallen off years ago.</p>

<p>The tree stood near a waterhole, and some sceptical manager
had in former times built a shepherd's hut under its unholy
shade, but all the shepherds who were stationed there had
committed suicide one after another with such praiseworthy
perseverance that the place was abandoned, and even the cattle
refused to make a camp of the spot, although in every way
desirable.</p>

<p>The ghost who walked the gully was supposed to be the ghost of
one of the stockmen who hanged the blacks. Some legends said that
he was pursued by a howling mob of blacks who finally hanged him,
shrieking from the withered limb. Others were to the effect that
the suicides and murdered blacks arose and danced a weird dance
around the Hangman's Tree.</p>

<p>Mivert thought of all these stories as he looked upon his
surroundings, which were not of a cheerful kind, as seen under
the rays of the half-moon. The framework of the hut still
remained standing, and the three graves of the self-murderers,
each fenced in with rough posts and rails, were plainly
visible.</p>

<p>Mivert lit his pipe and took up his station under the
Hangman's Tree. He fully expected that, in spite of their solemn
protestations, it was the intention of the boys to play some
trick on him, and determined that they should get a Roland for an
Oliver; but hour after hour went on, and save for the
exhilarating howl of a native dog, his watch was undisturbed.</p>

<p>It was near midnight, and the moon had set, leaving but the
stars to lighten up the scene, when Mivert thought he heard a
sound like somebody sobbing in close proximity to him. He
listened and was convinced that there was someone sobbing
bitterly in the near neighborhood. For a moment he felt startled,
then the belief that it was a clever hoax, taking an unexpected
form, took possession of him, and he darted round the tree,
whence the sounds proceeded, and grasped a dark figure standing
there.</p>

<p>'No good, old man&mdash;' he commenced when the figure started
back with a frightened cry, and Mivert saw to his astonishment
that it was a woman whom he had handled so roughly. 'Good God!
Who are you?' he gasped, all fear of the supernatural driven
clean out of his head.</p>

<p>'Oh, who are you? Do help me home. I have been away so long,
so long.'</p>

<p>Mivert saw by the pale light of the stars that the newcomer
had a riding habit on, and that her voice was the low, musical
voice of a well-bred young girl but he could think of no one in
the neighborhood at all like her in appearance&mdash;all the
women on the neighboring stations were middle-aged and had large
families.</p>

<p>'Where do you live?' he asked.</p>

<p>'At Castlebrook,' she replied.</p>

<p>Mivert started, Castlebrook was the former name of the station
he was living on, only, the old abandoned homestead was some
distance away from the present one.</p>

<p>'At Castlebrook,' he repeated. 'Certainly, I will help you
home, but I live near Castlebrook, and the old station homestead
is abandoned now. You must mean Brookfield, the new place. Were
you going there, and lost your way?'</p>

<p>'No, my home is at Castlebrook, my father is Captain
Baird.'</p>

<p>Captain Baird had been in his grave for more years than Mivert
knew. The girl must have had a fall and was rambling in her mind.
Baird first took up the country, and formed the old station; but
that was before the girl beside him could have been born. He must
see her back to the station at any rate.</p>

<p>He offered her his arm, and she took it, and gathered up her
habit with her other hand. Mivert walked slowly and thought it
well to avoid touching upon any but trivial subjects, trusting
that the manager's wife would find out all about her when they
got to the station. The track on coming out of the gully led
through a patch of brigalow and gidea scrub.</p>

<p>They were near the centre when Mivert noticed the slight
pressure on his arm relax, he turned to speak to his companion
and she had vanished. Gone, without a sign or sound.</p>

<p>Mivert felt a shock of fear; then He called to her without
avail. The scrub was silent, and there was neither sound nor
movement. Could she have gone back to the gully? He rapidly
retraced his steps, but at the Hangman's Tree and the gully there
was no sign of life, and his calls remained unanswered.</p>

<p>It was a warm night, and, wearied and worried, he laid himself
down to sleep out the remainder of his watch.</p>

<p>Daylight, and he had a swim in the lagoon, and went back to
the station to meet as best he could the badinage of his
companions. He would not admit that he had seen anything in
particular; but one or two strange things had happened which were
worth investigating, and he intended to spend another night
there. Of course he had many offers of companionship, which he
declined, assuring them that when he had solved the mystery they
should all benefit by it.</p>

<p>It was shortly before midnight the following night when Mivert
reached the Hangman's Tree. The place seemed as deserted as when
he last saw it on his return from his strange walk with his
companion who so mysteriously disappeared. He waited under the
tree, and watched the declining moon, which still shed its faint
beams on the gully. He was lost in thought, when a touch on his
arm made him start.</p>

<p>There stood the girl, and by the stronger light he could see
that she was young and handsome; but whether it was the moonlight
or not her face looked very pale.</p>

<p>'Where did you go to last night, asked Mivert; 'and what are
you doing here again?'</p>

<p>'I couldn't go past that place, you know; do you think you
could get me past to-night? I will hold tight to your arm.'</p>

<p>'But, Miss Baird, where have you been since you left me?
Surely you have not been wandering about the bush all the
time?'</p>

<p>'No; I have been asleep. But I want to go home so badly.'</p>

<p>More than ever impressed with the Idea that the unfortunate
girl was suffering under some mental delusion, although fairly
perplexed as to where she could be living, Mivert felt in a fix.
However, the only tiling now was to try arid get her to the
station, if possible.</p>

<p>'Come; we will start,' he said. 'Mind and hold fast to my arm
when going through the scrub,' he added, seeking to reassure the
fancy that seemed to haunt her. They started, and on nearing the
track through the scrub Mivert felt his companion's clasp
tightening on his arm, until it became almost painful. Suddenly
it was torn away. His arm was not let go; but the girl's hand
forcibly wrenched away from his arm, as though done by some cruel
physical power.</p>

<p>The girl had vanished as before, and Mivert was alone in the
scrub again, with his heart beating fast and the dew of terror on
his brow, for which he could scarcely be blamed. In the distance
he heard a faint cry. If it was not fancy, it sounded like 'Come
back again. Oh, come back! I must go home.'</p>

<p>Gloomy and taciturn, Mivert passed the following day brooding
over the problem of the past two nights. Who or what was this
creature of midnight who could, not pass a point in the scrub
without vanishing? That she was not of this world he felt sure,
but yet the touch of her hand was firm and life-like. His eyes
were red with want of sleep, but still he felt that he must keep
the ghostly tryst that night.</p>

<p>The moon now shed a fairly good light, and when Mivert took
his stand by the Hangman's Tree the gully was fairly well
illuminated. I will watch and see where she comes from, he
thought: but watch as he would, the presence approached him
unawares and unobserved, and was standing by his side 'ere he was
aware of its coming.</p>

<p>'Do try and take me back to-night,' she pleaded. 'I am so
tired, and want to go home. Listen! Can you carry me through, the
scrub, and hold me fast and tight, so that I can go home?'</p>

<p>'I'll try my best,' said Mivert. 'Let us go now while the moon
is still high.' Together they went along the track once more, and
as they approached the scrub Mivert stooped and took the girl's
slight form up in his arms, as he would a child's.</p>

<p>'Oh, you will carry me safely through,' she murmured in a
restful tone, and putting her hand over his shoulder she pressed
her deathly cold lips to his. Then Mivert went on with his light
burden, and had reached the centre of the scrub when, with a cry
of despair, the girl was forcibly rent from him by unseen hands,
and he was once more alone. Only the cry was still ringing in his
ears of 'Come back again! Come, back!'</p>

<p>'I don't know what's up with Mivert,' said someone at the dawn
of day, rousing up the manager of Brookfield. 'He's as mad as a
hatter, and keeps wanting to get up and go away.'</p>

<p>The superintendent went to the room Mivert shared with another
man, and found him in a high stage of delirium.</p>

<p>'He's been stalking off to that old Hangman's Gully chasing a
ghost for the last night or two,' volunteered Mivert's
roommate.</p>

<p>'Then he's caught some sort of malarial fever bad,' said the
super, 'very bad indeed. You'll have to go for the doctor. Saddle
up, and look sharp.'</p>

<p>Mivert was delirious all day, spite of the sleeping draughts
the doctor administered. Towards midnight be grew violent, and it
was with the utmost difficulty, he was kept in bed. After
midnight the paroxysm subsided and he looked at the super with
rational eyes.</p>

<p>'She has gone home,' he said, to him in an earnest whisper.
'She came and told me; it is all well with her.</p>

<p>Towards morning the fever increased, and he became
unconscious&mdash;a state, from which he only rallied just before
his death at sunrise. He begged the superintendent to search the
scrub between tie station and the Hangman's Gully.</p>

<p> AFTER the burial of poor Mivert, they searched the scrub foot
by foot, and found the bones of a skeleton, which the doctor
pronounced to be those of a woman. Amongst the bones was found a
brooch and a bracelet, but all articles of clothing had long
since yielded to time and exposure.</p>

<p>Living on the station was an old Irishwoman, who with her
husband, since dead, had been there since the early days of the
first pioneers, and had seen service with all the successive
owners. Old Margaret, as she was called, became greatly excited
when she heard of the discovery, and asked to see the brooch and
bracelet.</p>

<p>'The good God!' she exclaimed when she saw them, 'and it's the
pretty daughter of Captain Baird ye have found after all. Poor
girlie! She went out for a ride one day, and never came back,
though her horse did. Sure they searched high and low, and she
lying dead in the black scrub all the time. It killed her father.
She was all he had of kith or kin. He never looked up after. I
remember it well, for I was young at the time, and she and I were
great friends; and by the same token I pinned the brooch for her
before she went out that day. And how did poor Mr. Mivert know
the colleen was lying there? She must have come and told him.
Bury the poor creature's bones where his are, and perhaps she'll
be at rest. 'Twas cruel to die like that, and 'twas cruel on
young Mr. Mivert to die of seeing her.'</p>

<h3>A STORY OF THE PAST</h3>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 16 June 1906</h3>

<p class="first">MY name is Carjava, and I was second steersman
on board the yacht <i>Arnhem</i> when we left Amboina, in 1623,
on a voyage of discovery to the lands eastward and southward of
Java. We were accompanied by another yacht, the <i>Pera</i>.
Although my name is Spanish, I, like my father, was born in
Holland, and have always considered myself one of that
nation.</p>

<p>All went well with us until we sighted land and skirted it for
nearly two days' sail. The shore was fringed with mangroves, but
from the masthead we could see that there was rising ground just
within the mangrove belt, and one clear morning, immediately
before the sun rose, the tops of snow-clad mountains could be
discerned far, far in the interior.</p>

<p>From my position as second steersman, I, of necessity, knew
something of these seas, and knew that the land before us was
called Novo Guinea.</p>

<p>As our object was to steer south and examine the great
Southland known to exist there, and it being doubtful from the
report of the captain of the <i>Duyfken</i> as to the reception
we should meet there from the Indians, it was decided to send
ashore at the first likely place and replenish our
water-casks.</p>

<p>It was not long before we came to an open beach, which
promised good landing, and from aloft there appeared to be a
lagoon but a short distance from the beach. All looked
inviting.</p>

<p>We went ashore, a strong party, two boats from the
<i>Arnhem</i> and two from the <i>Pera</i> our own captain, Jan
Carstens, being in command. There appeared to be no Indians in
the neighbourhood, nor was the fresh water a great distance from
the sea, so taking our barracos and leaving a guard we proceeded
inland and filled our casks at the lagoon.</p>

<p>We then returned to the boats. Captain Carstens and some men
remaining behind to examine the country more closely as it
appeared to be deserted and safe. We stowed the barracos, and
were awaiting the return of our captain, when suddenly the
silence was broken by the most awful and fiendish yells man ever
heard. Naturally we made all haste to our captain and his men,
for they had evidently been attacked, and met him retreating with
his sailors, pursued by what seemed countless swarms of Indians.
Tall, copper-coloured men they were, with great mops of yellow
hair. They were discharging flights of arrows and throwing spears
at the fugitives, and although we made as much speed as possible,
and put on a bold front, we were too late; the lightly-clad
Indians had overtaken our comrades and killed them.</p>

<p>The savages on seeing us approach, halted, and the men on the
ship firing off a carronade, they took fright, and ran away.
Alas, our captain and all his party were killed. Having heard
that these cruel wretches were cannibals we took the bodies on
board and buried them at tea. It was useless to think of avenging
them, for the Indians could evade us with ease.</p>

<p>The head merchant, Gerrit Pietersz, now took charge and we
sailed away from the ill-omened depot, which had determined the
fate of our captain and eight of his men. It also determined the
fate of myself ere many days. Our coarse was south, and we soon
sighted the land that had been seen by the <i>Duyfken</i>. Here
we were somewhat luckier, for we found a wide opening into which
flowed a river which the boats could ascend and obtain fresh
water without the men landing.</p>

<p>We kept on, skirting the land south and west, but found it
everywhere shallow, barren, and of no use whatever to the Dutch
East India Company, while the natives were gaunt, treacherous,
and half starved, in no way so sturdy as those who had killed the
captain.</p>

<p>Still following the land, finding the same low muddy mangrove
swamps, we again turned north, showing that we had been sailing
round a great gulf. On this course we finally came to a headland,
and when we had rounded it the shore trended westward again, but
here my voyage on the <i>Arnhem</i> came to a sudden end.</p>

<p>The head merchant, who had succeeded the captain, was not very
friendly towards me, being in that respect very different from my
late captain, who had stood my very good friend on more than one
occasion.</p>

<p>With Gerrit Pietersz, it was quite otherwise; he lost no
opportunity to find fault end bicker with me; nor was I popular
with the crew. This arose from my Spanish name, for at that time
the most bitter enmity existed between Spain and Holland.</p>

<p>One evening a quarrel arose amongst the sailors on deck, and
one drew a knife, and stabbed another. I was close at hand, and,
though too late to stop the blow, I immediately closed with the
murderer, and wrested the knife from his hand. What was my
astonishment, to find myself seized, and accused of the crime.
Protest was useless. I was dragged before Pietersz, who had
evidently prejudged the case. The sailors swore positively that I
struck the blow, and that they had seized me with the knife in my
hand.</p>

<p>Nay, the actual, murderer went further, and vowed that I had
snatched the knife from his belt to commit the deed in order to
fasten the crime on him. Against this I had only my protestations
of innocence to offer, and, most unfortunately, the sailor who
was killed was known to have carried a grudge against me.</p>

<p>I was put in irons in the hold and confined there all night.
The next morning I was brought on deck, as I concluded, to be
hanged; but a more lingering death was in waiting for me. The
yacht was hove to, a boat lowered, and several articles of
dunnage put in it. Then my irons were struck off, and I was
roughly told to follow. I was to be marooned&mdash;left alone
among the cannibal savages of the great South land!</p>

<p>I commenced to protest, but Pietersz cut me short and,
pointing to the yardarm, said, 'You have your choice&mdash;one or
the other.'</p>

<p>For a moment I felt tempted to choose the disgraceful death,
but the next instant changed my mind and went myself into the
boat. Three men followed, and, I was silently pulled ashore. Just
there the land was clear and open, free from mangroves; and I and
my belongings were quickly landed, and the boat backed out and
pulled for the <i>Arnhem</i>.</p>

<p>As long as my enemies were in sight I maintained a firm front;
but when the yacht had shaken out her sails, and followed the
<i>Pera</i>, now some distance away, and the two discovery ships
disappeared found a point of land, and I was alone, I threw
myself down in a stupor of despair.</p>

<p>The heat of the sun aroused me. Rallying myself, I examined my
poor belongings. I must confess that in this respect I had been
fairly well treated, although I at once guessed that I owed it
principally to the kindliness of the first steersman, for I
remembered seeing him passing the things into the boat
himself.</p>

<p>There was enough biscuit and pork to last me a month with
care, a cook-pot, and, above all, a musket and ammunition, a
hatchet and jack-knife; and when I opened the bag of biscuit I
found thrust within a pipe and tobacco, fishhooks and lines.
These few possessions, and the knowledge that I owed them to a
friend, put me in better spirits.</p>

<p>My first care was to remove my provisions to a place of
comparative safety, and, determined to keep my courage up, I made
an ample breakfast, for the last time, meaning to husband my
resources hereafter. Then I started to see what sort of a place I
had been left in.</p>

<p>The outlook was promising, the country being open, without any
thickets to conceal the lurking Indians. As I proceeded a little
further I came to a lagoon with water lilies on it, and many
ducks and other birds swimming on its surface. I had not
approached very cautiously, and when they caught sight of me they
arose and flew with a great whirring and clapping of wings.</p>

<p>I was, however, hugely delighted at seeing them, as it
relieved me from the fear of dying from hunger and thirst. I
returned to the shore, and looked about for a place where I could
sleep, tolerably secure from the Indians.</p>

<p>I selected a rock, elevated and hard to climb, also protected
on each side by two more rocks. I took my hatchet, and lopped
some boughs for my bed; then, thankful that my life was spared, I
slept soundly all night.</p>

<p>And so two or three weeks passed. I saw no Indians, I caught
fish, and occasionally managed to knock over a duck; but the
loneliness was awful. I watched the horizon closely, for I hoped
that the Pera might return alone, and out of pity take me off. I
could only afford myself a small pipeful of tobacco every night,
and I had finished this one night, and was sitting dozily
dreaming, wondering whether I should ever see a light shine out
across the sea-line, when suddenly I saw one. I sprang to my feet
in amazement.</p>

<p><br>
IT was a light sure enough; Not only one, but two; and as I
watched, two more shone out. There were four.</p>

<p>By the position and the distance between them I took them to
be four different craft lying a short distance off shore. I must
have slept unknowingly, and during my sleep, they must have come
up in the darkness. I glanced at the stars, and saw that the
night was well advanced. Even as I watched, with every nerve
strained; my heart beating fast with hope and doubt, I heard a
strange sound behind me like a chorus of distant voices.</p>

<p>The Indians at last! Was I to die, just when a faint chance of
life offered?</p>

<p>The lights were stationary. I turned my attention to the
Indians. A soft whisper of wind brought me the voices more
distinctly, and I thought I could distinguish a glow in the
direction of the lagoon. I took my gun, and stole stealthily
towards it.</p>

<p>When I reached the open space where I had first come upon the
lagoon I saw at least five or six fires burning on the bank, and
loudly I could now hear the savage chant rising and falling. From
out of the brilliant circle of light they could not well see me
in the surrounding darkness; but I could safety watch them. It
was not a reassuring sight for a solitary man to witness in the
great unknown land I was then in. Round the largest fire circled
in a peculiar dance about thirty Indians, their black bodies
streaked with white in a hideous manner, and as they wheeled
round the blazing brands they looked like fiends rejoicing over a
lost soul.</p>

<p>The women apparently were squatting apart, drumming on their
laps, and droning forth a savage song, the men joining in now and
then. Sick and unmanned, I stole back to the camp on the shore,
butt the sight of those four lights at sea restored my spirits.
They were stilt there, and I saw by the sinking constellations
that daylight would soon end my suspense.</p>

<p>The dawn came and brightened, and I made out four high-peaked
vessels close to the shore. The darkness had deceived me. I
recognised them at once as Malay proas. The Malays were friendly
with the Dutch, and I rejoiced. So engaged was I in watching the
proas, that I had forgotten all about the Indians, when I was
startled by a rustle in the bushes, turned, and there stood one
of them not 20 yards away, with spears in his hand.</p>

<p>He gave a startled cry at my movement, for his eyes, like
mine, had been fixed on the proas. He jumped back and I ducked
behind the rock. A shower of spears hurtled over me. I rose
quickly and shot the nearest Indian; then crouched once more, and
the spears flew wide. So the fight went on, when suddenly there
was the familiar grating sound of a boat's keel, and a dozen
Malay sailors rushed past me and put the Indians to speedy
flight, following them, stabbing them with their krises. At the
boat stood a corpulent old Malay, clad in a gorgeous sash and
turban.</p>

<p>He smiled pleasantly enough at me, and said in broken Dutch,
'You sailor man?'</p>

<p>I nodded, and he said, 'Ship?' pointing to the rocks as though
he meant to ask had she been wrecked.</p>

<p>I nodded again, and intimated by sighs that I wanted to be
taken off. This he understood, and indicated that he would take
me. Then a gleam of cupidity came into his eyes, and he field out
his hand for the musket I still held. I had no other means of
paying my passage, so gave it to him with the best grace I could,
with the balls and powder horn. By this time the Malays were
straggling back. With their bloody krises thrust in their sashes.
Afterwards I learned that these conflicts with the Indians
occurred whenever they met. I had unconsciously done the Malays
good service, for the fight with me upset the ambush the Indians
were preparing for them, this being a favourite place for the
Malays to water their boats. How good it was to be once more
among my fellow beings, even if they were only, Malay pirates.
How good to leave behind me that great lone land of savage
solitude.</p>

<p>Of my life with the Malays I have not much to say. It tasted
some years, for although I could have returned to Java, I had no
wish to be hanged for a crime I had not committed.</p>

<p>One day we were again off the coast of the Southland, but
further west than we had ever been before, when we sighted a
stranded ship, evidently a Hollander. I boarded her with a boat's
crew to see if there was anything left on board, and from what I
saw concluded she was not a discovery ship, but one on the way to
Batavia, driven out of her way by a violent storm.</p>

<p>At first I thought that she was deserted, but on entering the
cabin I found three bodies in it. On a couch lay the form of a
man dressed in rich uniform; and by his side knelt woman, her
face buried in her hands. The third man lay in a huddled heap in
one corner.</p>

<p>The dark storm clouds were breaking, and the cabin was not so
gloomy. I went over to the couch and its double burden, and
gently raised the woman's bead. To my surprise she was a
beautiful girl dressed in the robes of a lady Of Quality. She was
alive, but seemingly in a deep swoon. The man was dead, dried
blood caked in hideous patches on his gay clothing. I went to the
third, and as I stooped over him a ray of sunlight darted into
the corner where he lay, and I recognised the features.</p>

<p>'Gerrit Pietersz!' I exclaimed.</p>

<p>To my surprise, he feebly opened his eyes.</p>

<p>'Who are you who calls me by name?' he demanded, staring at my
dress.</p>

<p>'Juan Carjava, whom you marooned on this coast!'</p>

<p>'Alive! Lift my head and give me a drink. I would speak.'</p>

<p>I picked up a flask from those that were scattered on the
floor, and supporting his head held it to his lips. It revived
him a little, and he glanced over at the silent figures.</p>

<p>'Both dead?' he asked.</p>

<p>'The woman is alive. But what happened?' I demanded in my
turn.</p>

<p>'Ask that beautiful hell-cat. A stout ship, a rich cargo, and
five score lives sacrificed for a wanton's whims. You are
exonerated: the rascal who did the deed confessed, and you can go
back. I am glad; your fate has troubled me.'</p>

<p>He was growing weaker, but he managed to gasp out: 'Living or
dead, cast her in the sea,' and, with a curse on his lips his
spirit passed.</p>

<p>The serang came in to tell me that there was no one left on
board, but there was much blood and marks of fighting; the
weather was fast clearing, and the plunder&mdash;but words failed
him.</p>

<p>Our fat old chief Ramma soon came off, and his delight at the
prize was unbounded. I took him into the cabin to see the bodies,
and the sole survivor, who was still unconscious, but the mystery
of the wreck did not trouble them much. They were dead, and there
was no one to dispute his claim.</p>

<p>Old Ramma had an island called Ratti, where he stored all his
plunder, and a rich hoard he had there. Beside the piratical
fleet, he owned many proas engaged in fishing for
<i>bêche-de-mer</i> on the northern shore of the Southland; and
he was a man of importance among his countrymen.</p>

<p>We were some days transferring the loot, and though the fair
lady soon recovered, nothing could be obtained from her in
explanation of the tragedy. Her name was Von Heslau, and she was
a niece of the Governor-General of the East India Company, and to
his care she was coming out to Batavia.</p>

<p>Of the voyage she would say little or nothing, save that she
kept her cabin very much, and there was fighting and bloodshed.
Strange to say, when she heard that there were no other
survivors, and that Pietersz had but lived a few moments, she
quickly gained her spirits, and was as gay as though she had
never known a care.</p>

<p>Ramma was in great good humour, and had all her belongings, of
which she claimed a great quantity, carefully stowed away to send
with herself to Batavia as soon as we had arrived at Ratti.</p>

<p>The old villain was greatly taken with her grace and beauty,
and, I believe, would have offered to make her Ranee of his
island kingdom had I not pointed out to him the risk of offending
the powerful Dutch Company. He was, however, anxious to secure a
treaty with them about Ratti, so it was arranged that I should
convoy Fräulein von Heslau to her uncle, and enter into
negotiations with him on Ramma's behalf.</p>

<p>Arrived at Ratti, a proa was soon made ready for our trip, and
the time came to say farewell. Ramma bowed gravely to the girl to
whom he had behaved with distinguished courtesy.</p>

<p>'Child,' he said in the Malay language, 'when you want a
friend, send to old Ramma. Bend your head.'</p>

<p>She looked at me, and I translated his speech. Laughingly she
inclined her handsome head, and he slipped over it on to her neck
a double string of splendid pearls of great value. She gave a
loud cry of admiration and delight when she saw what he had
done.</p>

<p>A fair wind soon took M to Batavia; that a memorable incident
occurred on the trip. The gnädiges Fräulein had never deigned to
exercise the spell of her fascinations over me&mdash;I was but a
poor castaway; but once she stooped to speak of the past.</p>

<p>'Did Captain Gerrit speak of me ere he died?'</p>

<p>'He spoke but a few wandering words, Fräulein.'</p>

<p>'Truth to tell, they were evil words; but doubtless he
raved.'</p>

<p>She looked sternly at me. 'It were well to forget a dying
man's ravings. They hang men for piracy in these seas, do they
not? And I have heard men speak of my uncle as a hard judge.'</p>

<p>She turned away, and left me meditating.</p>

<p><br>
THE Governor-General received me graciously, thanked me for
the care of his young relative, promised to guarantee Ramma
against any molestation of his island by Dutch ships, and further
offered me the post of first steersman, on board a ship bound for
Holland.</p>

<p>I returned to Ratti on the proa, and told the satisfactory
tidings to Ramma. He was very cordial, and when; I left a few
weeks after, he pressed on me a heavy bag of dollars, in addition
to my share of the loot, so that I, a naked, starving outcast
when he rescued me, bade fair to return to Holland with some
store.</p>

<p>I heard much of Fräulein von Heslau when I returned to Java.
Of her wit and beauty, of the many fatal duels she had caused,
and of more than one suicide. But of herself I saw nothing till
just before my departure, and then I made bold to call a Javanese
boy conducted me to the garden, where she was indolently
reclining on a bamboo lounge.</p>

<p>She looked at me with languid surprise.</p>

<p>'Well, sailor, what is it?'</p>

<p>'Pardon me, Fräulein, I am the Dutch sailor who rescued you
from the wreck. I sail for Holland to-morrow. I ventured to call
to say farewell.'</p>

<p>'Ah, I did not recognise you without your pirate dress. It is
just as well that you have, the air of Java may not prove
healthy. Do you want money?'</p>

<p>'I am in no want of money. I have but to offer my respectful
farewell.'</p>

<p>I bowed low, and was turning away, when she spoke again.</p>

<p>'Have you heard anything of that funny old Malay chief? I
forget his name.'</p>

<p>And as she spoke I saw her fingers toying with the double coil
of priceless pearls she wore round her white throat.</p>

<p><br>
WHEN Abel Tasman made his second voyage of discovery to the
south, Juan Carjava held a position of trust on the Limmen. A
year before that the pest swept down upon Java, and among the
victims at Batavia was the Governor's niece, Fräulein von
Heslau.</p>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>19. &mdash; BREAD CAST ON THE WATERS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia,10 July 1897</h3>

<p class="first">IT was a bright, cheerful looking site for a
station homestead, and the passing traveller who happened to come
that way always wondered why it should have been abandoned. The
remains of the house and the outbuildings stood on a rising knoll
overlooking a crescent-shaped lagoon and a wide stretch of open
country, with a range of blue hills in the far distance. The
straggling trees and bushes of a once well cared for garden were
still visible; but the intruding couch grass had covered the beds
and paths, the fence was down, and all was now an untouched
wilderness. Everything that could be of use at the new site
selected for the head station had been removed, and only the
gaunt corner posts and uprights of the buildings remained.</p>

<p>One thing only was exempt from ruin and decay, and that caught
the eye at once. It was a grave, enclosed by an iron railing, and
evidently still carefully tended. At the head a willow tree had
been planted, and it had thriven and grown wonderfully, and now
drooped over the headstone and trailed its slender branches
against the inscription that was on it&mdash;a simple one, the
intials 'J.S.' only and a date. Who lay beneath, man or woman,
one could not tell; but it was somebody whose memory was still
kept green. It was such a peaceful-looking spot, in spite of the
forlorn appearance that always settles down on an abandoned
homestead, that one unconsciously envied the one who, 'after
life's fitful fever,' slept so well there, undisturbed, save by
the sheep who straggled in to drink at the lagoon, and camp under
the shady trees during the hot hours of the day, and those who
came to tend the grave with loving hands.</p>

<p>All around spoke of rest and quiet, such rest and quiet as
should linger round the grave of one who had been, perhaps, an
idolised and only child, or a fair young wife, who, with her
first-born, had faded out of her year-old married happiness, or a
revered and reverend man whose blameless life had been passed in
deeds of benevolence.</p>

<p>The man who slumbered in that nameless grave was an outcast
from his fellows. One whose hands were stained with blood, and
whose life had been passed in crime, in riot, and debauchery. But
for one good deed he had earned this peaceful grave, cared for
and watched, when all he had to expect was the quicklime of the
gaol yard.</p>

<p><br>
JIMMY STONE was noted from boyhood for his surly temper and
brutal disposition. Dogs cleared out of his way intuitively,
children slunk away from him, and he never had a friend. He was a
good all-round man on a station; but was always getting sacked
for his cruelty to horses and cattle. If he went splitting he
continually quarrelled with his mates, and in consequence he
became a kind of social 'hatter,' and that did not improve his
temper. In a sort of way he was dimly conscious of his weakness
of temper, and when he eventually killed a man, and had to do two
years for manslaughter, it was brought strongly home to him that
there was something very wrong somewhere.</p>

<p>But Jim blamed the laws of society for it, and considered it
interference with the liberty of the subject. Jim did a little
horse stealing and a little honest work when it suited him, and
drank a good deal, and occasionally got into prison. He had to
shift his districts occasionally, and at last found himself on
the Palmer River, in North Queensland, in the early days of the
rush. He had rather a good time with some congenial mates, and
they did a roaring trade while the rush lasted and the fever
raged, and men died in lonely places, and left their horses and
goods behind them for the first comer.</p>

<p>Chinamen, too, were fine game, and Jim and his mates used to
have rare sport when a gang came along in deadly terror of the
natives, and ready to drop their swags and bolt at the first
alarm.</p>

<p>But things, of course, got too warm for them in a short time,
and the little pleasure party split up. Jim and another fellow
went fossicking. It was away in one of the barren spinifex
gullies, some distance from any camp, that Jim came on a tent,
and inside the tent was a man wasted with fever. Jim had seen a
good deal of this sort of thing, and often made a small rise on
the strength of it. He looked at the man and his belongings, and
saw that he was well equipped, and there were several things that
he desired. He bent over the man, who was muttering deliriously.
He was scarcely a man, and his beardless face; worn delicate by
sickness, was like a girl's. When Jim stooped over him he opened
a pair of large brown eyes, and looked at him solemnly, and
without recognition.</p>

<p>Jim drew back; then he went outside, got his water-bag, and
gave the sufferer a drink. Once upon a time Jim had had a love
experience. She was a girl with brown eyes like the sick boy's.
She was not one of the model women of the world; but she had
loved the brutal man, who did not hesitate to chastise her
occasionally after the manner of his kind; but that was nothing
to her, as he was faithful in his way.</p>

<p>One day Jim caught her talking to a man whom he had long
Jealously suspected, and whom he had forbidden her to speak to.
The chastisement inflicted on that occasion was particularly
severe; but she took it without complaint, and bore up for a long
time, until at last she had to give in, and be taken to the
hospital. What he she told about her bruised body Jim never knew;
but she lingered for a week, and then died. Jim saw her just
before her death, and he remembered those fond, dying eyes; he
had never forgotten them. The girl had died like a dumb dog
fondling the hand that killed her.</p>

<p>Stone meditated on these things in his clumsy, ignorant way,
until he was aroused by a horse's tread. His mate had followed
him. He dismounted, and gazed inquiringly at Jim.</p>

<p>'Cove dead or sick?' he said.</p>

<p>'Sick,' said Jim.</p>

<p>The other looked inside the tent, and his eyes glistened. 'My
oath, that's a good gun he's got. I Just what I want. He'll die
right enough. We I can help ourselves and leave him.'</p>

<p>'He won't die if he's looked after,' said Jim, sullenly.</p>

<p>Who's going to look after him? You going to turn sick
nurse?'</p>

<p>'Yes; if I choose to.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you're welcome to for me. But I want that I gun; you can
take his revolver. I suppose his I horses have gone to the bounds
of blazes.'</p>

<p>'I suppose they have; that's why you can't have the
gun&mdash;it might be wanted.'</p>

<p>'But I'm going to have it. If you like to play I the idiot I'm
not going to. I'll go in and twist his neck for two pins!'</p>

<p>'I'm hanged if you will; and if I am it will be for you!'</p>

<p>Then there was a very pretty quarrel, and Jim's mate
completely lost his temper, which was a very foolish thing to do
under the circumstances, because for once in his life Jim
resolutely kept his.</p>

<p>'Let's have it out down there,' he said, after I some mutual
recrimination. 'I've given the boy a drink, and he's asleep, and
I'm not going to have I him woke up.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you won't, won't you? Well, to oblige I you I'll step
over there. I've quilted you before, Jim Stone, and I'll do it
again, and thoroughly this time.' and they set off to a
convincing ground. Then, having lost his temper, the mate
incautiously proceeded to take his shirt off when they, arrived
there. He got it over his head, but he never I got it any
further.</p>

<p>Jim went back alone.</p>

<p>That was Jim's good deed; but be never bragged I about it. It
was not his weakness to boast. Stone found that there was a
little water in the I gully and a bit of feed for the two
horses&mdash;his late mate's and his own. He went back to his own
camp, and packed everything over, and started on his new career
as sick nurse. It was a long time before the boy got strong
enough to get up; but Jim stuck to him; and once the blacks gave
them a call, and Jim found the disputed gun very handy.</p>

<p>As soon as the youngster got well enough Jim packed him to the
nearest camp by easy stages. He had heard all his story which was
that of a very innocent but good-hearted youth, who had started
off brimful of adventure and inexperience. He made over to Jim
all his chattels, swore eternal gratitude, and departed for the
south to go back to his own people; and Jim wandered off to his
own people, which were of a different class.</p>

<p><br>
TEN or fifteen years had passed, when Jim Stone, whose wild
life was telling upon him a good deal, found himself one day in
the character of a swagman humping his drum past the station
already mentioned, not then abandoned. He went up to the cook to
get some rations, and travellers not being numerous, was told he
could stop the night and get his meals.</p>

<p>'What's the cove's name??' he asked.</p>

<p>'Wingfield,' replied the cook.</p>

<p>Jim started slightly, and just then a little girl came running
into the kitchen with a message from her mother. Jim saw the same
brown eyes he had nursed back to life.</p>

<p>'One of his kids?' he asked when the child was gone.</p>

<p>'Yes; the only one. Two have died here. They talk of shifting
the station, think the place isn't healthy.'</p>

<p>'He owns the place, then?'</p>

<p>'Yes; it's his own, and he isn't a bad sort, either.'</p>

<p>'Think I'll see him in the morning.'</p>

<p>'Better. He might find you something.'</p>

<p>Jim interviewed Wingfield in the morning. He recognised the
sick boy in the bearded man; but there was no recognition by the
other one. Jim was and felt prematurely old; his hair and beard
were white, and his face, never too handsome, was seamed with
toil and evil passions. Wingfield did not like his appearance,
and curtly informed him that he had no work to offer him.</p>

<p>Jim looked around, and a great weariness of spirit came over
him&mdash;a longing to end his days in peace and rest, away from
the heat and struggle of the past. He was tired and worn. He
asked if he could stay the day and spell; but did not betray
himself. His request was readily granted.</p>

<p>It was evening, and Wingfield and his wife were standing in
the verandah, when their only child ran up to them full of
news.</p>

<p>'Oh, dad! it's so strange. I asked that old traveller in the
kitchen to tell me some stories, and he knows one just like that
one of your's, about a man being alone and sick in the bush, and
how another man came and stopped with him, and fought the
black-fellows.'</p>

<p>'It can't be the same,' said Wingfield, in answer to his
wife's surprised and questioning look. 'Stone was a fine, manly
bushman: this man is like what you would imagine in old lag to
be.'</p>

<p>Such is the glamor of memory.</p>

<p>Wingfield went out to the traveller.</p>

<p>'Are you the Stone who saved my life on the Palmer years
ago?'</p>

<p>'I'm the man. Do you remember this?' he opened his shirt, and
showed the old scar of a black's spear taken in defence of the
man before him.</p>

<p>Wingfield did not hesitate; but to him the disappointment at
first was bitter. The Jim Stone of his memory was a hero of
heroes; but this evil-looking old swagman was no hero; but he was
the man, and Jim found a haven and a fast friend in the little
girl, who henceforth took him entirely under her protection. It
was she who in after times tended the grave of the man who had
saved her father's life. But fortunately no one ever knew the
truth, that the real good deed was not the romantic one of
tending the sick youth and defending him from the blacks, but
shooting a man when in the act of taking his shirt off.</p>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>20. &mdash; THE DEAD MALAY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 1 Jul 1899</h3>

<p class="first">WE stood on the summit of one of the highest
altitudes of the King Leopold Ranges, in North Western Australia,
and looked from thence to the north-east over a land that is
almost new to white men; Grey and Lushington only having made a
slight advance into it. There were three of us whites, and a
Kimberley black boy. We had been fossicking without success
around the western base of the ranges, and at last determined to
surmount them, and see what lay beyond. We had lost one horse and
much temper in making the ascent, for the King Leopold Ranges, if
not high, are rugged and abrupt.</p>

<p>Looking to the north-east, the country appeared much the same
as the usual coastal lands or Northern Australia, but we fancied
we could pick out an easy descent to the more level country
below. About fifteen, miles away, we calculated, there appeared a
line of dark foliage, which we took to indicate a river; beyond
the river, if river it was, a high ridge shut out any further
view. Our boy came from the head of the Marguerite River, and
could give us no information of what we should find when we got
down on the country before us.</p>

<p>It was mid-day, but being winter time it was nothing more than
a pleasant temperature, and we made up our minds to make the
presumed river that night. We had not much trouble to get down
the range, and arrived at the bank of the river about sundown.
There were good feed and water, and we turned out and made
ourselves comfortable.</p>

<p>'I suppose,' said Gordon, 'this will be an upper tributary of
one of the rivers Grey was on?'</p>

<p>'Apparently so,' I replied, 'perhaps those wonderful cave
paintings are somewhere on it.'</p>

<p>'Do you believe in their existence?' said Rogers.</p>

<p>'I believe that when they come to be examined again, they will
be found to resemble other black fellows' work. Grey was young
and inexperienced at the time, and I don't doubt but what his
imagination carried him slightly away,' I replied.</p>

<p>'What do you say to going down and having a look at them?'
said Rogers.</p>

<p>'Too rough; and not worth knocking our horses about over,'
returned Gordon.</p>

<p>Dismissing the subject, we turned in and the night passed
peacefully, although each one of us the next morning related how
he had dreamed of the aureoled figure described by Grey. The next
two days were uneventful; the country was indifferent; there were
no auriferous indications, and nothing to delay us. The third
day, from the top of a high ridge, we saw the sea and a tall
elevation right on the coast, its base seemingly washed by the
ocean. Towards this we steered our course, and camped at the foot
of it that night.</p>

<p>Next morning early we ascended it; and had a splendid view of
the bay, of which the elevation we were on formed the head, and
of the archipelago of islands that lay beyond. So interested were
we in the seaward view that we did not look around until an
exclamation from Gordon caused us to do so.</p>

<p>'Glory! What's that?' he said.</p>

<p>'That' appeared to be a mass of solid green, which we had no
difficulty in recognising as a bamboo jungle. About this part of
Northern Australia we had not seen any bamboos, although they are
common enough in the Northern Territory. The singularity was in
coming across this isolated clump, as the bamboo spreads rapidly
along tropical rivers. The clump in question appeared to be of
some extent, and had some sort of symmetry about it. Seemingly it
was about ten miles away.</p>

<p>Before leaving the crest of the hill we were standing on
Rogers drew our attention to the smooth decline of bare rock that
ran down almost from our feet without check or break right into
the sea for a descent of nearly 200 ft. Although the day was
calm, there was a swell on, and the waves came climbing hungrily
for some distance up the smooth rock.</p>

<p>'A pretty slide a man would have if he happened to slip down
there,' said Rogers.</p>

<p>'Yes; he'd set his trousers on fire before he got to the
water,' laughed Gordon; and we went back to our camp.</p>

<p>Naturally, we made for the jungle of bamboos. They were old
plants, thick-stemmed, interlaced, and hard as iron, absolutely
impenetrable. We followed them round, and found that they were
growing in a perfect square, about a mile away.</p>

<p>'These have been planted&mdash;this is artificial work,' I
said.</p>

<p>'It was not done by the natives, at any rate, for we have not
seen track or sign of them since we crossed the range,' remarked
Gordon.</p>

<p>Rogers, who had been silent for some time, said, 'I believe
the place is open inside, and this is a hedge of bamboos planted
by the Malays, who must have introduced the bamboo to Australia.
They had good-sized fleets of proas off this coast at one
time.'</p>

<p>'If there is something enclosed inside, it must be worth going
in to see, but how are we to get through?' I said.</p>

<p>'It would blunt any axe or tomahawk going in a dozen chops. I
know these old bamboos,' returned Gordon.</p>

<p>'Let's see if Dandy can shin up one, and get a look inside,' I
said.</p>

<p>Dandy soon peeled off, and easily went aloft. For some time he
could not seemingly see for the intervening feathery tops, as he
could not trust himself to the top of the bamboo, but at last he
sang out, 'Me see him. House bin sit down there!'</p>

<p>He came down, much excited. On asking about the house, he
described it by drawing it on the ground, as a low, oblong
structure with a flat roof. He said that all the land around was
bare, and that the house stood in the middle of the
enclosure.</p>

<p>We had to get inside that enclosure somehow&mdash;that was our
united determination. There was water not far off, and while
Rogers and the boy fixed up a tamp, Gordon and I rode round the
bamboos again. At last we came to a place where the bamboos had
not thriven well, probably on account of the stony nature of the
soil, a bit of rocky country here coming in. Not only that, but
some of the bamboos were dead, and, we concluded that with fire
and axe, we could force a gap. If we failed, we should have to
dig a way, and uproot the trees, as being easier than cutting
them down.</p>

<p>It was two days, and, I might say, nights, for we kept the
fires going all night, before we found ourselves in the
enclosure, so stubborn and broad was the hedge by which it was
surrounded.</p>

<p>It was with a certain feeling of awe that we looked around
this mysterious enclosure. Dandy's description had been accurate
enough. We stood on a bare and naked plain, surrounded by the
bamboo hedge, and in the middle rose the small building. It was
oblong-shaped, with sloping sides and flat roof, about fourteen
feet high and fourteen by eight, on a ground plan.</p>

<p>When we reached it we saw that it was built of mud bricks,
painted, or coated rather, with some solution that had resisted
all the weather that had so long beaten on it. There were no
windows and no door nor entrance.</p>

<p>'It is a tomb,' said Gordon.</p>

<p>'Tomb or not,' replied Rogers, 'we must see the inside of
it.'</p>

<p>To this we agreed, and selected a place of attack. Once the
coating was through the mud bricks were soft and friable, and we
worked away with a will.</p>

<p>'Look out for foul air!' said Rogers, as the point of his pick
went through, and we heard a fall of bricks in the interior.</p>

<p>We soon had a large gap in the wall; it seemed like sacrilege
thus partially to destroy this curious relic, but there was no
other way to get at the secret of its construction, nor the
purpose thereof.</p>

<p>The air that came but was certainly very bad. Whenever we
caught a whiff of it we had to speedily retire, so that, it being
about the middle of the day, we decided to finish the gap, and
then go away and have our mid-day meal before entering, leaving
the air to clear.</p>

<p>This we did, and when we came back, we found we could enter
with perfect safety. The light streaming in through the ragged
hole we had made revealed to us a strange sight.</p>

<p>In the centre of the apartment, on a raised bier, lay the body
of a man in perfect preservation. His features were Malay, and
his dress was also Malay in type, such as is worn by the Rajahs
of the Celebes and other islands. He lay on his back with his
hands clasped, and his attitude was almost exactly similar to the
sculptured figures on old European tombs. Evidently he was a man
of high rank, for his sarong and turban were richly worked and
wrought with pearls and stones of value.</p>

<p>His face was strong and dignified, and he might have been
asleep, instead of in the grasp of death. Certainly his
preservation was wonderful in the extreme, and accomplished by
some process that left embalmment far behind.</p>

<p>Glancing around, we saw figures were painted on the wall,
figures which we all recognised as those described by Grey in his
journal. We spoke to each other in awed whispers for the
surroundings were solemn in the extreme, when suddenly Dandy
interrupted us by a loud cry of terror, and ran out of the
opening.</p>

<p>Glancing at the corpse, we saw that a change was taking place;
whatever it was that had been, employed it could not resist the
action of the outside air, and now it was falling into
nothingness before our eyes. If was a fascinating, if thrilling,
sight to see what might have been a sleeping human being wither
and vanish into a little grey dust and empty robes. Where had
been the dead rajah there was now nothing but his rich clothes,
and they, too, went to pieces like tinder at our touch, and all
that survived of this strange occupant of the tomb were the
pearls and gems that had been on his dress, the gold thread they
had been sewn with, and a sheet of metal like copper beaten thin,
on which he had lain. This, when we took it outside in the
strong light, proved to be covered with written characters
deeply scratched on its surface.</p>

<p>Returning to camp, after a close examination of the inside of
the enclosure which resulted in nothing, we found Dandy squatting
by the fire, and muttering to himself. He had got a terrible
fright, and it was some time before he recovered his nerve.</p>

<p>We devoted several days to searching for further traces of the
Malays, but found nothing more. When we were ready to start, we
went up to the top of the hill from which we had first caught
sight of the bamboos, and stood there looking out across the
bright bay, and the islands, and thinking how it must have
looked when the Malay fleet was riding at anchor there. Suddenly
Dandy shrieked with horror, and cried out, 'Man there! Man
there!'</p>

<p>We looked round, but could see nothing. When we looked back,
Dandy was just slipping on the edge of the treacherous incline, a
look of agony and terror on his face, terror of something he saw
which we could not see; then, before we could save him, he was
gone to his death. He slid down with ever-increasing velocity,
uttering, at first, painful cries, but these soon stopped, and,
when at last he reached the water and vanished in a receding
wave, he must have been quite dead.</p>

<p>With one accord we left the fatal spot, and took our homeward
way, scarcely daring to speak of what we had witnessed, and quite
unable to account for it.</p>

<p><br>
THE inscribed metal plate has since been translated by a
well-known professor of Oriental languages, and this is the
purport of it. However, before mentioning this, I may say that
ere we left the spot the whole of the building forming the
mausoleum fell into ruins from the action of the air on the
inside parts which had been so long hermetically sealed.</p>

<p>This, then, is the story of the dead Rajah, and it dates back
as far as the 15th century:</p>

<p>One of the Rajahs of the straits who sent their fishing fleets
to the north coast of Australia, from time immemorial, had but
one son. He was of a brave disposition, but of weak health. His
father sent him with the annual fishing fleet, hoping to restore
him to vigor. He grew better on the voyage, and, landing with a
party one day, they were attacked, by the Australian natives,
with whom they had continued conflicts.</p>

<p>The Rajah's son received a severe wound, and the fleet sailed
back with him on board. He was dying when he arrived, but he
found his father dying, too. The old Rajah issued certain
instructions to his principal chiefs to be carried out after his
death and his son's death. These instructions, on the death of
the son, which occurred only a few hours after the death of the
father, were strictly carried out.</p>

<p>The young man's body was preserved according to a now
forgotten process; he was dressed in royal robes, and conveyed
back to the scene of his receiving the fatal wound. Then the tomb
was built, and the bamboo planted, and the work of vengeance
commenced. They watched the bamboos grow, and they captured the
natives time by time, and by batches they were plunged&mdash;men,
women, and children, young and old&mdash;down the rocky face of
the outstanding point, down to death, and burial in the sea. They
waited until the district was depopulated, and the smoke of a
camp fire never rose to the sky. These were the victims which
accompanied the last of their Rajahs to the other world.</p>

<p>What was it that drove Dandy to be the last victim? Was it the
Spirit of the dead Rajah we had liberated from the tomb?</p>

<p class="first">'THESE yarns about bush ghosts are all very

fast asleep and quiet. Now, the ghost I mean was in a city, in
Sydney, and he used to drive a cab about, a ghostly cab drawn by
a ghostly horse, and woe betide anyone who engaged him.'</p>

<p>'I suppose,' said the owner of the station, just waking up
from a doze, 'that most people had what is called the jim-jams
when they hailed him?'</p>

<p>'Nothing of the sort. I saw him myself once, at least the man
I was with said it was the ghost cab, but it certainly did look
very real; but I was in Sydney when it was all found out about
the cabman's murder, and then the ghost and the cab, and the
horse, and all, were never seen again.</p>

<p>'I can give you the true version, for the man who brought it
about was a friend of mine, and told, me all about it.'</p>

<p>'I was in a phantom cab that was dematerialised once,' said
the station owner. 'I hailed it early one morning, and it seemed
an alright sort of cab, and when I got into it it went off as
usual, but when we got in the street where there was an electric
light I suddenly saw a cart right ahead of us, and before I could
call out we went right bang through it, and then through several
buildings, and the whole blessed thing dematerialised, and left
me sitting in the middle of the road, with a policeman asking me
my name and address.'</p>

<p>'Oh! be quiet,' said Doubleton, 'I'll tell you the yarn if you
like and you'll hold your tongue; if not, say so?'</p>

<p>'Let us hear it?' said Dwyer.</p>

<p><br>
WELL, my friend, his name was Ryland, lived in the suburbs. He
had been to supper, and just about midnight was returning home,
when he saw a cab crawling along the street just in front of him,
so he hailed it, and the cab stopped. The driver looked at him as
he came up, and stooping down, he said, 'Do you want to go far,
sir; my horse is tired?'</p>

<p>Now, this was a very natural question to ask at that time of
night, so, Ryland had not the least suspicion of this being
anything else but an ordinary cab, and told the man where he
lived, and the man said he could manage it&mdash;so he got in,
and the cabby drove off. Ryland might have dozed off; he's not
prepared to swear that he didn't; anyway, he was awakened by
voices, and feeling the cab stop. The cab had stopped, and the
driver was in the road talking to a woman who was about to get
into the cab.</p>

<p>'Here, what's this?' said Ryland. 'I object to anyone coming
in; beside, you said your horse was tired.'</p>

<p>'He objects,' said the woman.</p>

<p>'It don't matter whether he objects or not,' said the cabman;
'its got to be. To-night's the twenty-first of November, and I've
got to drive you there, so get in.'</p>

<p>Without more ado the woman got in, and as she passed the light
of the lamps Ryland saw that she was very well dressed and very
handsome. He was wide awake by now, and quite ready to see the
adventure out to the end. On first waking he had thought that it
was only some belated creature of the night who wanted a lift
home. Now he saw that things were not what they seemed. His new
companion sat quietly alongside him, and the horse seemed to have
suddenly recovered all its fire and energy, for the cab bowled
along the road as though the own brother to Cauliflower was in
the shafts.</p>

<p>'You are out late,' said Ryland; 'lucky it's a fine
night.'</p>

<p>He told me that, as soon as he'd spoken, it struck him his
speech was not an example of wonderful brilliancy, but he felt
that he must say something.</p>

<p>'You're out late, too,' said his new companion; 'but I don't
consider the night fine.'</p>

<p>Just as she spoke, the sky seemed to get suddenly overcast,
and a pelting rain commenced.</p>

<p>Ryland had a great coat on his arm, and the lady was in
evening dress, with just what they call a cloud over her head and
round her throat, so he took his coat and offered it to her to
put round her shoulders, and she accepted it without a word of
thanks.</p>

<p>Presently the horse and cab pulled up short before a house
standing by itself in good-sized grounds. The gate was wide open,
and up the drive they went, and pulled up in front of the house.
The cabman was down like a shot, and thundered on the door with
the knocker so that Ryland said, 'He's making enough noise to
wake the dead.'</p>

<p>'Hush!' said the lady. 'He <i>is</i> waking the dead.'</p>

<p>Presently the door opened, And the lady made preparations for
getting out, so Ryland he jumped out to help her. She put her
hand in his, and it was so cold through her glove that it felt
like a burn where it had touched him. The door was open, and
there was a light in the hall, and the minute that lady stepped
into the hall, the night was fine, clear, and calm once more.</p>

<p>'You'd better look after the cab for a bit,' said a voice
beside him; 'I've got to go inside.'</p>

<p>Ryland found the cabman at his elbow.</p>

<p>'Supposing you look after your own cab,' he said, 'and I'll go
inside if anybody is wanted.'</p>

<p>'I've no objection,' said the cabman, 'not the slightest. It's
them inside might object.'</p>

<p>Ryland thought a bit. 'I'll go,' he said to himself, 'but I'll
just take the number of this cab first,' and he scribbled the
number painted on the lamps on his cuff. The number was 010203,
and a very queer number he thought it was at the time. Then he
turned, and was much astonished to find his great coat still on
his arm, although he could have sworn that he put it over the
lady's shoulders, and had not taken it back again.</p>

<p>He marched boldly in, never thinking what a liberty he was
taking, and hearing voices in a room on the left-hand side of the
hall he knocked at the door; there was no answer, so he opened it
and walked in. The room was lit up, and the lady was there with
two men, one old and one young.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' said Ryland, 'but I wish to know if the
lady requires the cab any more?'</p>

<p>The old man looked at him, and said, 'Go away, cabman, until
you are called.'</p>

<p>The young man&mdash;and a regular bounder he was&mdash;turned
round, and stared at Ryland very hard.</p>

<p>'I'm not the cabman,' said Ryland, 'but I hired the cabman to
take me home, and he may as well do it if this lady has quite
finished with his services.'</p>

<p>'Don't go yet!' cried the lady, suddenly starting from her
chair.</p>

<p>Now in the full light of the gas lamps Ryland said she was the
most beautiful creature he ever saw.</p>

<p>'No; I won't go,' he said immediately, 'if you ask me to
stay,' and he eat down on a chair.</p>

<p>The old man looked annoyed, and the young bounder stared at
him more insolently than ever.</p>

<p>'He can stay,' said the old man, 'if he gives us his name and
address. He'll do for a witness, as well as the cabman; and,
Charley, we must have no noise, no noise.'</p>

<p>Hardly had he got the words out of his mouth than the lady
started up and commenced screaming&mdash;scream after scream,
enough to take the roof off the house. The young man began to
curse, and the old man put his hands to his ears.</p>

<p>Ryland jumped up, too, and looked about for some water, for he
thought it was a case of hysterics; but as soon as he get up the
young man flew at him and clutched him by the throat, and so
sudden was the attack that Ryland was overborne and fell on the
floor, knocking his head against the leg of a good solid table as
he did so. He just remembered the cabman opening the door and
bursting in when his senses left him. When he came to them again,
the room was quiet and empty, though the lights were still
burning. He got up and looked around, and then saw that he was
not alone, for on the sofa lay the Lady.</p>

<p>Ryland went over to her, but she was quite still, with her
eyes half open, looking ghastly. He felt her forehead, and it was
cold, she had no pulse, and she was dead, as dead as could be.
While Ryland was attending to her, he heard a voice outside, and
going to the French window, saw a light down the garden, and
heard the sound of pick and shovel. He went out off the window
and crept down very quietly.</p>

<p>There were the two men, the old man and the young one working
away digging a hole. The asphalt path was torn up, and underneath
It they were digging a grave.</p>

<p>'That will be deep enough,' said the young one at last,
'to-morrow morning I'll fix the asphalt over it smooth.'</p>

<p>Then they went aside and staggered up again with the body of
the cabman in their arms, quite dead and limp. They put the body
in the grave and filled it up, and put the asphalt over it again
roughly. Ryland noted the place, and saw that one side there was
a big Norfolk Island pine, and on the other a very thick bush.
The men went back to the house, and Ryland followed them.</p>

<p>But instead of following the men, he suddenly found himself
walking along the same street where he had picked up the cab, and
before him was the cab crawling along as before. Thinking himself
the victim of some delusion, he first felt his head, which was
quite sound and then hailed the cab.</p>

<p>The cab stopped, it was not the same cab, and glancing at the
lamps, Ryland saw that it was not the same number; but the man,
although he was not the same man, made the same reply about his
horse being tired. However, he consented to take his fare, and
Ryland got in. He kept a sharp lookout all the way, but nothing
strange occurred, and he arrived safely at his own abode.</p>

<p>'You don't know of a cab with the number 010203, do you?'
asked Ryland, after he had paid the man.</p>

<p>'There's no such a number of any cab,' replied the driver.
'What is it again, sir?'</p>

<p>Ryland read off the number on his cuff by the light of the
lamp, '010203.' The man leaned down from his seat, and listened
attentively. 'One, two, three?' he repeated. 'Take the '0's out
o' that, and that there's the number of the ghost cab, one
hundred and twenty-three.'</p>

<p>'The ghost's cab?'</p>

<p>'Yes, have you never heard of it. One hundred and
twenty-three, the numbers just come in regular order, 1, 2, 3. It
was drove by Jim Cleary, and he disappeared, and his horse and
cab was driven out to a scrub, out Bondi way, and left there, but
the cab had all the lining torn out, and the cushions taken
away.'</p>

<p>'Suppose you tell me all about it to-morrow; it's rather too
late to-night. If that was the ghost's cab, why, I had a ride in
it to-night.'</p>

<p>The cabman looked at him curiously; then he said, 'What time
shall I be here to-morrow, sir?'</p>

<p>'Oh, about half-past 9 or 10,' answered Ryland, and went in to
puzzle over his strange adventure.</p>

<p><br>
A LITTLE before ten the cabman appeared, the real one, not the
ghost, and Ryland took him up to his room, and cross-questioned
him as to all he knew about Cleary's disappearance. It was not
much after all; but the date tallied with Cleary's disappearance.
The man, whose name was Hart, was naturally very curious to know
all about the ghost cab, but Ryland did not tell him just then,
but he described the house to him as well as he could, and told
him to drive about and look for one like it.</p>

<p>In a day or two he thought of going to the Public Library and
hunting up the papers to see if he could find anything else about
that time to associate with the disappearance of Cleary.</p>

<p>He found all about that, about the horse and cab being found
in the scrub and the absence of the cushions, but for a long time
he could see no trace of anything else.</p>

<p>At last he hit upon a paragraph called 'The Ranchurch
Mystery.' In this he found that the residents of the suburb of
Ranchurch were much excited about the disappearance of the
inhabitants of a house in that suburb. The description of the
occupants agreed very well with what Ryland had seen. A young man
and his wife and his father had lived there, they had kept two
servants, but they had been suddenly dismissed, the house shut up
a few days afterwards, and the occupants had gone away, and had
not returned. The house was the property of the tenants, so
beyond the agent coming out to look at it occasionally it
remained just as when it was left.</p>

<p>This was only a piece of that occasional and quite unnecessary
gossip that finds its way into a paper when there is really
nothing else to write about, but it afforded Ryland a clue to the
place he wanted. He noted down the address. Strolling down he
passed a cabstand, and saw the man Hart on the rank. He beckoned
to him, and asked him whether he had found the house yet, because
'I have without going out of town,' he added.</p>

<p>'Drive to Blodger and Sprice, the land and house agents,' he
said, and got in.</p>

<p>The clerk at the counter knew nothing of a house at Ranchurch,
but fortunately Mr. Blodger was in and disengaged. Yes, a house
at Ranchurch was in his hands to look after, but it was neither
to sell nor to let.</p>

<p>Ryland made out he was very anxious to make an offer for it if
he could go over it, and see what the house was like inside.</p>

<p>'There's a caretaker there,' said Mr. Blodger, doubtfully,
'and if I give you a card you might go over; but he is a
cantankerous old villain, and if he's in a cranky temper he might
refuse. I have no power over him myself, and, to tell you the
truth, wish I had nothing to do with the tally thing.'</p>

<p>'I'll go,' said Ryland, and the agent gave him a card.</p>

<p>The distance to Ranchurch was soon, covered, and the cabman
pulled up before a house that Ryland dreamily seemed to recognise
as the one he had seen on the night of his ride in the phantom
cab.</p>

<p>'Seems like the haunted house in Hood's poem,' he thought as
he got out of the cab. The iron gate was rusty and apparently
seldom used, but it did not stand ajar, but was chained and
padlocked. The garden was neglected, the house had all the blinds
down, and not a sign of life was visible.</p>

<p>'How the devil am I to get in?' he said aloud. 'There's no
bell visible.'</p>

<p>'Climb over, sir,' suggested Hart from the seat of the cab.
Ryland pooh-poohed the suggestion, as the railings were of iron,
and he had a decent suit of clothes on; instead of that he gave
vent to the most awful 'cooee' that he could.</p>

<p>'Enough to wake the dead,' he thought, and surely enough a
blind was raised, and the head of an old man peered out. Ryland
waved some papers at him as though he had a whole budget of
correspondence in his pocket, and the face disappeared.</p>

<p>Next, the door opened, and an old man came slowly and
painfully towards the gate.</p>

<p>'One of the ghosts,' muttered the awe-struck watcher as he saw
that it was the old man of the dream. The figure came up to the
gate.</p>

<p>'What is it?' he snarled through the bars. 'I have a
communication from Mr. Blodger concerning the house,' replied
Ryland.</p>

<p>'Well, give it me.'</p>

<p>'But I want to come in and see the house; I'm thinking of
buying it.'</p>

<p>The old man gazed on him doubtfully, and, muttering to
himself, unlocked the gate, and admitted Ryland. As soon as he
was inside, Ryland opened the gate wide, and beckoned to Hart to
drive in.</p>

<p>The old man stood aghast. 'We don't want any more cabmen in
here,' he said; then, suddenly stopping, he went on down the
drive, and led the way to the house.</p>

<p>When they got there, Ryland told Hart to get down, and wait,
and keep his ears open, then giving Blodger's card to the old
man, who was waiting at the door, he followed him Into the house.
Dust everywhere, darkness and mildew. Ryland felt as he followed
his guide that he was back once more in his strange experience of
the Phantom cab.</p>

<p>On they went through different rooms, where the furniture was
rotting untended and the shrouded windows steeped the rooms in
semi-darkness.</p>

<p>They had entered the room which Ryland remembered well, and,
lookup round, saw that the furniture was unchanged since he had
imagined he was there!</p>

<p>'I should like to see the garden,' said Ryland.</p>

<p>'Like to see the garden, would you?' said the old man, glaring
at him, 'come on then.'</p>

<p>They were in the hall, the front door was open, and, unseen by
the old caretaker, Ryland made a sign to Hart to come in, and
follow them. Sauntering round, they at last came to the place
which he had marked down in his vision. The Norfolk Island pine
on one side of the broad path, and the thick shrub on the other.
Ryland looked at the asphalt, and then at the old map?</p>

<p>'It was just here, wasn't it?' he said. The living ghost gazed
at him with horror, his lips moved convulsively; then he dropped
down in it fit.</p>

<p>Presently he came round, but he was all broken up, and
confessed to everything. The son's wife had money, but It was
securely settled on her, and they could, touch nothing without
her consent, and so badly was she treated by them that she went
to live with come friends in town.</p>

<p>One night, when there was a ball at her friends' house, they
sent Cleary, the cabman, whom she knew, to her with a note,
saying that her husband was dying; would she come and say goodbye
to him. Without thinking, she got into the cab, and came just as
she was. Then, when she found it was all false, she wanted to go
back, but they wouldn't let her, and they wanted her to sign some
deed about her property, which the cabman would witness. She
refused, got frightened, and began to scream.</p>

<p>Cleary came into see what was the matter, and the young fellow
who was a perfect savage, hit him a blow on the head which killed
him. The woman was senseless on the sofa, so they carried Cleary
out and put him inside the cab, and intended to start the horse
off, so that he'd smash the cab up somewhere; but the horse was
so tired that he wouldn't budge. Then they took him out again,
and buried him under the asphalt, and as the inside of the cab
was stained with blood, they drove it out to where it was found,
and tore the linings and cushions out and threw them in the
sea.</p>

<p>When the unfortunate wife woke up, her mind was gone. She was
taken to a lunatic asylum, and there she died, and the young
fellow got the money. He cleared out, and left his father to act
as caretaker at the place, and see that no body found the
cabman's body. But he treated him cruelly, and only allowed him
just enough to keep body and soul together.</p>

<p> 'WAS THAT all?' asked Dwyer&mdash;the owner of the station
was asleep.</p>

<p>'Yes, only the young fellow was caught easily enough and
hanged. The old fellow died in the gaol hospital, and cabman No.
010203 was never seen any more.</p>

<p>'He was under the asphalt then?'</p>

<p>'You bet he was; and would be there now only for Ryland going
for a ride in that phantom cab.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>22. &mdash; THE LUCK OF TINTINBURRA</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 23 Dec 1899</h3>

<p class="first">'MY dear fellow,' said the prosperous individual
to the seedy one. 'To tell you the truth, I am infinitely worse
off than you are.'</p>

<p>'Then you must be bad indeed, for I haven't the price of a
feed or a bed on me, and yet if I only had a few pounds I could
make thousands.'</p>

<p>'I've no doubt you could. I never knew a man in your position
who couldn't. But, unfortunately, I have not got the few pounds
to lend you. See here, Stanmore,' and he took out a sovereign
purse, and flicked it open, showing Its emptiness.</p>

<p>'That purse itself is worth a pound or two,' said the
other.</p>

<p>'Not paid for my boy. I should go to gaol on a vulgar charge
of larceny if I sold it, and when I do go I intend going on a
much more respectable scale.'</p>

<p>'Do you mean to say that there's a crash impending?'</p>

<p>'I do indeed, crash is a mild way of putting it. In a day or
two, exit your old friend Paul Wright.'</p>

<p>'I suppose you could save yourself even now if you had the
money?'</p>

<p>'I could, but where is the money?'</p>

<p>'Find me the few pounds I speak of and in all probability the
money is yours.'</p>

<p>'What's this mad idea?'</p>

<p>'If you are bound to go under, a few pounds more or less will
not make much difference; and the chance is A.1.'</p>

<p>'Let's go and sit down somewhere, and have a drink, and you
can tell me all about it. Anything is better than thinking, just
now.'</p>

<p>'You remember Mat Reynolds?'</p>

<p>'A fellow mad on re-prospecting old fields. Yes, but if he is
your authority on making a rise, it does not go for much.'</p>

<p>'Mat is not so mad as you think him. Anyhow, he has got
something this time. He has picked up the lost lead of the
Tintinburra. The company is about to be wound up, and the shares
can be had for the asking. You remember what they went up to
once. Well, they will go up beyond that this time. I did Mat a
good turn once, and he has taken me into his confidence, thinking
I could raise the needful. I relied on you, for I thought your
prosperity was the real thing. If you can raise a hundred, you
will get it back fifty-fold.'</p>

<p>'Why cannot Mat raise it himself?'</p>

<p>'Just because he has got the reputation you gave him just now.
People think he's got a bee in his bonnet.'</p>

<p>'And you don't, because you have nothing to lose?'</p>

<p>'I think he's right in what he says. I know the country, and
see no reason why it should not be so. I can't go into detail
because the secret is not mine.'</p>

<p>'Do you know that it will go hard with me if I Incur any more
liabilities at this stage of my affairs? At present I may come
out free with all my possessions under my hat; but if I raised a
hundred pounds it would be fraud&mdash;that is, it is very likely
to come under that head.'</p>

<p>Stanmore got up dejectedly.</p>

<p>'I see, if that's the way it stands, it is impossible to
expect it of you. I've lost so many chances during my life one
more or lees does not make much difference.'</p>

<p>'Stop a minute. I presume that your time is not valuable, and
I must say that, although you are a perfect Jonah of ill-luck,
you have always been indifferently truthful and honest. Now, I'll
consider this question a bit; meantime have a cigar, it is not
paid for, but cigars are meant for consumption, not like
jewellery.'</p>

<p>Stanmore lit the cigar, and smoked silently while his friend
pondered.</p>

<p>'Look here, Stanmore,' he said at last, 'you are, and always
have been, the most unlucky of men. I am superstitious, I
suppose, so are most of us, particularly where chance is mixed up
in it. Now, if you allow me to meet your Mat Reynolds, whom I
know but casually, and if I am satisfied of the <i>bona fides</i>
of the thing, I will risk it, and raise the money; but you must
not appear in the matter. Your infernal luck would ruin
everything.'</p>

<p>Stanmore glanced down at his shabby trousers and cracked
boots, then took a long pull at his cigar, and sighed.</p>

<p>'You see,' went on Wright, 'it's all in your own interest; I
risk more than you or Reynolds. You have nothing to risk, in
fact; and Reynolds has but this information. The whole thing must
be put entirely in my hands, or I won't stir in the matter.'</p>

<p>Stanmore smoked on and said nothing.</p>

<p>'Of course, I can do nothing but trust to you in the matter,
so I agree, only I must live while the affair goes on.'</p>

<p>'I'll see after that. Now, what time am I to meet
Reynolds?'</p>

<p>'Any time you like to-night' and they parted.</p>

<p><br>
THE finding of the lost lead of the Tintinburra Mine was more
than a nine-days' wonder, and the phenomenal price to which the
shares ran up was long remembered. Then the lead ran out again,
and shares went down to nothing once more, and some men went to
King-street, and some went into the harbor, and some retired to
suburban residences.</p>

<p>Mat Reynolds, the discoverer, went mad in reality. He could
have done well; but his faith in the recovered lead was so
absolute that he held on, and the shock was too much for him.
Wright was gay on his recovered fortunes, and redeemed character,
and, as for Stanmore, that unhappy Jonah had to content himself
with an extremely small portion which, growl as he might, be had
to accept. So he accepted it, and swore a bitter vengeance
against his one-time friend; then a sudden change set in, and his
luck became a proverb.</p>

<p>But it gave him no satisfaction, for the idea of having been
made a puppet of in the way he had been was bitter to him, and
the social success of Wright was an aching smart in his own good
fortune.</p>

<p>As his means grew, he set to work to thwart Wright in every
possible way he could, and gradually got the whip hand of that
individual in a very substantial manner.</p>

<p>At last Wright took occasion to speak to him on the subject,
and explained, to his own satisfaction&mdash;and many would have
agreed with him&mdash;that the risk he took in the matter
entitled him to the lion's share of the plunder. But Stanmore, in
his perverse grudge, would hear none of it.</p>

<p>'When you are in the position I was when I came to you,
perhaps I'll forgive you, and, if I can bring you to that
position, I intend to do it.'</p>

<p>With that he left him.</p>

<p><br>
AS years went on, this mad hatred still continued, till at
last it appeared as though Stanmore would achieve his desire. The
ill luck which had so dogged him seemed to be transferred to his
enemy, for Wright gradually sank, as Stanmore prospered.</p>

<p>One day when Wright, now reduced, was traversing the city in
search of employment, the face of a ghost from the past arrested
his attention, stopped, turned, and walked beside him. It was Mat
Reynolds, lately released from the lunatic asylum as cured. He
spoke rationally, but his one theme was the lost lead of
Tintinburra. He wanted money to go back and renew his prospecting
work. There he was confident that he could pick up the lead once
more, if he only had the money.</p>

<p>'Go and ask Stanmore,' said Wright, and turned away with a
grim laugh. But Reynolds followed him up.</p>

<p>'I have seen him, and asked him,' he said. 'He has promised to
help me if you will go and ask him.'</p>

<p>'<i>I</i> go! That is only a lie of his to degrade me still
further. He mainly brought me down to this, and now he wants me
to go begging to him, as he did to me. He told me as much. No,
you must get it out of him some other way. I'll not ask.'</p>

<p>Reynolds begged and entreated, but Wright would not do it. For
weeks he still walked about looking for work, and for weeks the
ghost haunted him, and would not be put off, always entreating
him to put his pride away, and they would both be rich once more.
Till at last, worn, worried, and overcome, Wright consented.</p>

<p>'Your luck, Wright, is so infernally bad, that perhaps it is
better your name should not appear. I'll look after your
interests,' said Stanmore. He was wasted, and a light of fever
burnt in his eyes.</p>

<p>'Look after your own interests,' retorted Wright, 'you've not
much longer to do it.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?'</p>

<p>'Mean, man! Death is written on your face, as ever his finger
wrote it.'</p>

<p>'Is it; then I'll tell you what I'll do. Before we go into the
thing I'll make my will, and leave you all my share in the
Tintinburra Mine. Will that do you?'</p>

<p>'Go ahead as quick as you can; perhaps when you are dead my
luck will change again. Now, let us part. I'm hungry and
tired.'</p>

<p>Stanmore took a sovereign purse out of his pocket, emptied the
gold out of it, and said, 'I'll leave you that, old man, in my
will as well. Just as it is now.'</p>

<p>A hungry dead-beat loafing in Hyde Park saw two paragraphs in
a dropped paper that made him laugh grimly. One was to the effect
that Matthew Reynolds had blown his brains out, at the once
notorious Tintinburra Mine, the reason being, as most people
thought, on account of his failure to re-discover the lost lead.
The other paragraph related to the death of that eminent citizen, Mr.
Walter Stanmore. It did not tell that he died laughing, after
reading the account of Reynolds's suicide.</p>

<p>'Might as well get that sovereign purse, at any rate,' said
the dead-beat; 'wonder if my legs will carry me out there
to-morrow.'</p>

<p>He was in luck that evening, for he met an old acquaintance
who lent him 5 shillings, and warmed and comforted by a couple of
meals and a night's sleep in a bed, he went out to his enemy's
residence, and after some trouble and an appeal for the lawyer,
who happened to be there, he was admitted. The lawyer took a
wonderfully keen interest in him, and took him into a room by
himself.</p>

<p>'The will is simple enough, and will be easily proved,' he
commenced, when Wright interrupted him.</p>

<p>'I've come for the sovereign purse he was to leave me; I don't
care about anything else.'</p>

<p>'Certainly, he left you the sovereign purse, and all the
scrips of the Tintinburra Mine owned by him.'</p>

<p>'What's the good of that; I'll get a pound or two on the
sovereign purse.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps you don't know the rights of Reynolds's suicide; it's
only just come to hand. His head was weak, and when he found the
lead again&mdash;found the lead again,' he repeated, 'his brain
gave away, and he shot himself. That scrip will be of great value
in a few days. Here, hold up, man; we don't want three dead men
on our hands at once.'</p>

<p>But the third man did not die.</p>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>23. &mdash; THE SKELETON'S LEGACY</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 1 April 1899</h3>

<p class="first">IT seems a besetting weakness of living humanity
to ape the emblems of its long dead brethren. Men wear imitation
skulls as ornamental pine in their neckties, and the skull is a
favorite device to introduce in little knicknacks for the
writing-table, ink-stands, ashtrays, etc. In fact, everyone's
memory will tarnish him with some detail in which the emblems of
mortality, as they are called, play a part.</p>

<p>Going down George street very late one night, I came across a
skeleton holding a lamp-post up; at least he was hanging on to it
actually like grim death, as though either he or the lamp-post
intended to fall down shortly.</p>

<p>'Better take my arm,' I said; 'you seem to be gone at the
knees.'</p>

<p>'Thanks, old man, I am a bit wobbly. Can't carry my liquor
like I used to; no capacity now.'</p>

<p>He seemed a genial sort of skeleton, and when he disengaged
himself from his support and accepted my arm he got along very,
steadily, considering.</p>

<p>'You'd better come up to my rooms,' I suggested; 'I can put
you up for to-night.'</p>

<p>'I don't mind if I do, old man,' he replied; 'I'm a long way
from home, and the trams have stopped running and the last train
to Rookwood has left.'</p>

<p>By the time we got to my abode we were on very good terms, and
when I got him seated with a cigar in his mouth he was quite
genial. He had one disagreeable habit I admit, and that was that
he omitted to eject the smoke from his mouth, but instead let it
ooze out through his eye sockets, nostrils, and the cracks in his
skull, and other openings.</p>

<p>'You have a great leaning for skeletons in Australia,' he
said, as he reclined comfortably back in his chair. 'I seldom
pick up a bush story to read but what a skull and some bones
found in the bush after many years does not play a prominent
part. Now would you like to hear my story?'</p>

<p>I readily intimated my desire to do so.</p>

<p><br>
'I DIED nearly twenty years ago,' commenced the skeleton, 'and
I'm sorry to have to say that your coming across me in a state of
inebriation is due to the fact of my having died in a fit of
<i>delirium tremens</i>. To-day was the anniversary of my
death.'</p>

<p>'You keep it up,' I remarked.</p>

<p>'As you say, I keep it up, it's my one weakness now. I had a
good many when I was alive. Horses, wine, and the fair sex,' and
as the collection of old bones stopped to indulge in his
meditation on his past conquests, I gently jogged his memory.</p>

<p>'I beg your pardon,' he said, 'I was thinking of a girl I knew
once. Well, to continue. I ran through a lot of money in England,
and then came out here with the few thousands left out of a
tolerable fortune, and after getting some bush experience took a
partner named Beaumont and bought a station in Northern
Queensland.'</p>

<p>'My name is Beaumont,' I interrupted. 'Not a son of his?'
remarked the skeleton. 'I took good care of that.'</p>

<p>'No, but I had an uncle of the name who once had a station in
Queensland with a partner called Fletcher.'</p>

<p>'That was me,' said the skeleton kicking his bony toes up.
'Beaumont and Fletcher, that was our partnership signature. Queer
go eh; picked up by a nephew of my old partner when I'd got too
tight to catch the train. What a lark, especially when I killed
your uncle.'</p>

<p>'You killed my uncle!' I exclaimed, and in plain truth my
uncle had disappeared in a most mysterious manner.</p>

<p>'Yes, I killed him; but I know now it was under a mistaken
impression. It's no good you're getting your hair off about it.
I've been dead about twenty years, so you can't hurt me. Now
shall I tell you all about it?'</p>

<p>'Go on,' I said, re-seating myself, for in my natural
excitement I had sprung up. The skeleton went on.</p>

<p>'Your uncle and I got on famously for a while, but he was a
very steady fellow, and at last got to remonstrating with me on
my occasional outbursts of dissipation. This began to irritate
me, and a coldness was growing up between us when Dorothy Malcolm
came into our lives. She was the daughter of our nearest
neighbor, and came up to the station on a visit of a few months.
Both Beaumont and I fell in love with her at once, and I can
honestly say that for her sake I tried to reform my mode of life
and live cleanly. As often happens, the girl chose the crooked
stick&mdash;that was me&mdash;and refused the straight one. I was
the accepted suitor, and we were engaged. I went down to the
seaport to buy a ring and some presents, arid while there fell
into my old habits, and it was some time before I was able to go
back. During that time some kind gossip had carried the news up
to the station, and Beaumont met me with one of his hated
lectures and frankly told me that if it occurred again he should
feel it his duty to inform Dorothy's father, as it was impossible
the girl could be happy with a man of my confirmed habits.
Naturally I resented this, coming from a disappointed suitor, and
hot words passed between us, and in the end we agreed that our
partnership should terminate at the end of the year, about sis
months distant.</p>

<p>From that date I noticed a certain coldness growing between
Miss Malcolm and myself which, not unnaturally, I put down to
Beaumont's poisonous tongue. In truth. I know now that he never
spoke a word to her against me, but that my life of dissipation
had deteriorated my character so much, that, when it came to the
familiar relations of an engagement existing between us, most of
her illusions were speedily dispelled.</p>

<p>On first acquaintance the veneer of polish I had assumed had
completely deceived her, but as she saw my real character her
affection waned and I foresaw the breaking off of our
engagement.</p>

<p>I tell you that I had now began to hate my partner with a
perfectly ferocious hatred, and, when Miss Malcolm at last told
me that she had mistaken her feelings towards ire and requested
to be released from her engagement, I acted like a blackguard and
used words to her that no man should.</p>

<p>Returning to the station, Beaumont and I had a furious row,
and as we could no longer live together we decided to at once
separate until our affairs could be settled. Beaumont increased
my rancour by accepting the hospitality of our neighbor Malcolm.
This naturally made me believe that he was the man who was going
to succeed me in the daughter's favor.</p>

<p>I was fuming in the verandah when the blackboy, a boy who was
devoted to me, because, being an ex-trooper and devoted to drink,
he could always count on me to give him a nip, whereas Beaumont
would refuse him.</p>

<p>'Marrme,' he said, coming up the verandah, 'me bin find'em
gold.'</p>

<p>'Find gold?' I echoed.</p>

<p>'Alonga range,' and he held out a big lump of quartz, which
was simply half gold. I took it in amazement.</p>

<p>I knew that Pluto would not tell me a lie, and I knew that he
had a habit of absenting himself for some days from the station,
which was only overlooked in him because he was such a good
tracker and rider.</p>

<p>'Whereabouts alonga range?' I asked.</p>

<p>'You and me go. I know long time. Now Mister Beaumont gone,
you and me go.'</p>

<p>The next morning we started; the range was nearly thirty miles
away and it was evening before we reached it. We camped at the
foot of it, and next morning commenced the ascent. The range was
a steep, precipitous one which divided the rivers of the Pacific
coast from those flowing into the Gulf of Carpentaria.</p>

<p>Pluto finally led me to the head of a wild gorge surrounded by
scrub, or rather jungle, from which one could catch a glimpse of
the sea. The reef was there plain enough, and a for me was within
my grasp, but what of that, I wanted Dorothy Malcolm.</p>

<p>Gradually as I sat there a thought, a delightful scheme of
vengeance came into my head. Beaumont would be too poor to marry
after we parted. I had put most of the money in the station, and
he had little more than a working share. I would bring him out
and show him the wonderful reef, and twit him with it and what he
had lost. Then I would quietly dispose of him, and then, with
fortune before me, I would court Dorothy Malcolm once mote and
win her again.</p>

<p>The idea was too fascinating to resist. I got up and told
Pluto that we would go back. It was a wild view I saw as I stood
at the head of the gorge and looked seaward. The cliffs at my
feet were nearly precipitous, save that below me, about thirty
feet; lay a tiny ledge, and the bottom of the gorge, 500 feet at
least, was all scrub and jungle.</p>

<p>I sent a note over to Beaumont after my return, and asked him
to come over to see me on a matter of importance. He came, and I
showed him the piece of quartz which Pluto had given me, and told
him that as we were still virtually partners, I thought it only
right to acquaint him with the discovery.</p>

<p>He seemed struck, the poor fool, by my assumed honesty of
purpose, and readily consented to the plan I proposed. This was
that he should go back to Malcolm's, keep quiet about what I had
told him, and meet me at an appointed spot the next day when I
would take him to the reef.</p>

<p>He was there right enough, and he and I and Pluto rode out to
the reef in the range at the head of the gorge, Pluto the savage,
keen as all savages are, guessed what was coming, guessed partly
as a savage, guesses, but never guessed the whole truth. He rode
ahead leading the way and sometimes chanting a scrap of barbaric
corrobboree, so we went on, one to madness, and two to death. I
need not go into detail until we stood at the head of the gorge,
and Beaumont stooped in wondering ecstasy over the rich gold
reef.</p>

<p>'Is it good?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Fletcher, we are millionaires,' he said, 'and I have
misjudged you; another man would have kept this quiet until after
we had dissolved partnership. Shake hands, old man.'</p>

<p>He put his hand out and I brought the butt end of the driving
pick we had used for knocking off the quartz down on his
defenceless skull, he staggered back half stunned, and I pushed
him over the cliff. He fell on the ledge, and when Pluto and I
peered over he was sensible, thirty feet below. I shrieked at
him&mdash;</p>

<p>'You marry Dorothy, my partner; you think that I was going to
share this find with you and let you take my place? No, you dog;
you shall die as a dog! You poisoned my gin's ears with tales
about me, and you die!'</p>

<p>'Yowi! Die! die! die!' screamed Pluto, mad with the delight of
slaughter, and lifting a huge fragment of quartz, which we had
knocked off; he dropped it on the man's head, and the figure lay
quiet and inert.</p>

<p>I got up, for I had work yet to do.</p>

<p>'Pluto,' I said, 'It's your turn now, old boy. Very sorry,
but&mdash;' and before he could comprehend I had put two bullets
through him, and with one push he went down, down, to the very
bottom of the gorge. Poor Pluto! I felt sorry tor him even, as I
sent him to his death, but you must agree with the that his
murder was absolutely necessary, some day in a drunken fit he
would have revealed everything.</p>

<p>Beaumont's horse was found with the saddle turned under its
belly, but his remains were never discovered.</p>

<p>I never gained anything by the deed. Dorothy&mdash;although no
one suspected me of the crime, for nobody knew that Beaumont went
with us, and Pluto was supposed to have ran away&mdash;seemed to
regard me with a shrinking sort of horror against which there was
no making headway.</p>

<p>I sold out the station, came south and then Pluto began to
haunt me. Always and ever was it Pluto. Never Beaumont. Pluto,
with the look of horrified amazement on his face at my
treacherous attack, used to come and sit at my bedside until I
had to drown him in liquor, and in doing it I killed myself.</p>

<p>The reef is probably there untouched. I never dared go back to
the spot. Some spectre would have appeared and hurled me over the
cliff. Now don't speak nor make any remarks for the time is
short, And the witching hour of night long paste. You are
Beaumont's nephew, and I will make some amends by giving you the
directions to find that reef.</p>

<p>The skeleton Fletcher drew his chair to table and commenced to
write. How long he wrote I know not, for drowsiness overpowered
me, and I fell asleep.</p>

<p>It was broad daylight when I awoke and, recalling my stupid
wits, looked round for the skeleton, but there was nobody in the
room but myself and a strong smell of stale tobacco.</p>

<p>I threw the window open, and thought that I had gone to sleep
in my chair and had a queer I dream, and would have a bath and
freshen myself up; but there on the table lay a sheet of note
paper, closely written, and signed 'D. Z. Fletcher.'</p>

<p><br>
I FOUND the gorge and buried the bones of my uncle and the
betrayed black boy. The reef is now in full working order, and
paying well. I have never come across my acquaintance the
skeleton again, and it is to be hoped that he has abandoned the
pernicious habit of keeping it up on his death-day, which, he
informed me, answers to our birth-day during life.</p>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>24. &mdash; THE CHAPEL IN THE DESERT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 18 Dec 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">COCONUT, the black boy came up to the verandah
grinning all over his face, a sure sign that he considered his
news important. If a blackfellow has particularly bad news to
report he always grins more than ever. Blacks share with the
lower class of whites the love of importance attaching to the
messenger of evil tidings. This time, however, the news did not
immediately affect my friend and host Munster, on whose station
in Central Australia I then was.</p>

<p>'Blackfellow bin come up,' said Coconut. 'Myall fellow
nigger'&mdash;with great contempt&mdash;'bring paper yabba,' and
he handed Munster a cleft stick with a much greased and dirty
piece of paper in the slit, evidently folded by a white man.
Munster took it, and read it over to himself, then out loud.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">To the owner or manager of the nearest station.</p>

<p class="letter">The writer, a mate, and a blackboy started from
the head of the Gascoyne River (W.A.) to prospect across to the
overland line. When near the boundary our camels got away, all
but one we managed to secure. We could not overtake the others.
We pushed on with the one, but my mate, Thomas Lawson, died of
exhaustion. The blackboy went to a smoke he saw to look for
water, and never returned. I kept on, but the camel knocked up. I
was found in a dying state by a party of natives, and brought
into a little soakage well, and am with the blacks now; they are
very friendly. I beseech you, whoever receives this, to reward
the bearer, and come to my assistance. I have important knowledge
in my possession, which will recompense you. The blacks will
guide you back.</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Amos Dryant</span></p>

<p class="letter">October 19, 1895</p>

<br>

<p>We were both silent after the reading of this strange
document. Then we questioned Coconut as to the bearer. He
informed us that the bearer was at the blacks' camp, waiting. He
was frightened to come up to the house, so we should have to go
to the camp to see him. Without discussing the matter we went,
Munster first going to the store, and taking out a couple of
tomahawks and a piece of Turkey-red twill. We found the
messenger in the camp an evident myall of the myalls. After some
trouble, we found an old nigger who could fairly understand the
stranger, and bit by bit pieced out the story. The messenger had
not seen the white man; he was with a tribe a long way to the
westward of his hunting-ground; the 'paper yabba' had passed
through several hands before it reached him. Munster showed him
the two tomahawks and the red twill, and had it explained to him
that he would get one in the morning, when we started, and the
other and the red stuff after he had guided us to his tribe.</p>

<p>'If I had given him the tomahawk to-night,' said Munster, as
we strolled back, 'some of those beggars would have got it out of
him before morning. Now we will have a talk about this mysterious
message.'</p>

<p>We sat down on the verandah, and Munster said, 'You believe
this thing to be genuine?'</p>

<p>'As far as we have got, it seems incontestable so.'</p>

<p>'Good; so I think. You will come with me, of course, and we'll
take Coconut; that will be enough.'</p>

<p>'Now, the date of this message is October 19; man must have
kept a diary, I suppose; this is, November 12, so it has been
three weeks reaching us. Of course, that means nothing, for we
cannot tell how long it has lain in the different camps it has
passed through.'</p>

<p>'No,' I replied, 'the time is no criterion. The man may be
anywhere within 300 miles.</p>

<p>Munster got up, and consulted a. map stuck tip on the wall.
'We are one hundred and twenty miles from the boundary; I know
all the country that far. The chances are that he is still in
West Australia.'</p>

<p>'Can we manage with horses as far as you know?'</p>

<p>'I think so. We are pretty safe for water, with niggers
belonging to the country. The only thing is that these myalls
don't know how much water a horse wants. A little soakhole that
will do them they imagine will serve half a dozen horses. I've
been let in like that more than once.'</p>

<p>'What's this important knowledge he has in his possession, do
you think?'</p>

<p>'That's the part I like least about it, as if any white man
would not go after another without wanting a bribe held out.'</p>

<p>'True. But don't let us go out prejudiced, against the man. It
may have been written under the pressure of anxiety for somebody
to come to his rescue speedily. Neither you nor I would enjoy an
enforced sojourn in a blacks' camp.'</p>

<p>We made our arrangements for starting the next morning, and
before going to bed Munster made a copy of the message to take
with us.</p>

<p>'I'm going to leave the original at home,' he said.</p>

<p>Next morning at daylight we were off, the nigger trotting
along, proud in the possession of his new tomahawk. We did not
reach the place where his tribe was camped that day, but as
Munster knew the country we got water for the night, and the next
day, about noon, reached the end of our first stage in the
journey, the camp of the tribe the last messenger had come from.
It would be wearisome to recount the details of the trip.</p>

<p>We passed through three tribes of natives before reaching the
one which dwelt on the eastern side of a wide, expanse of dry
country, while the tribe the white man was with lived on the far,
or western side.</p>

<p>None of the blacks would accompany us, but, after much
trouble, we made out the situation and surroundings of the place
whereat expected to find the lender of the letter. Never in all
my life did I pass through such country as we traversed in that
stage. Spinifex, spinifex, the whole day long, in great banks 6
ft and 7ft high, showing years of gradual growth; spinifex is
rings and circles of eccentric shape. Nothing else but a few
stunted bloodwood trees; underneath, hard rock and gritty gravel;
overhead, cloudless sky and blazing sun. So we kept on until
Munster, looking back, said, 'By Jove! there's a fire chasing
us.'</p>

<p>We pulled up, and looked back. The heavens were being quickly
obscured by the dense black smoke of the resinous spinifex, and
though it was quite calm where we were the fire was bringing a
wind with it.</p>

<p>'We've plenty of time,' I said; 'we'll start one ahead, here's
lots of clear ground about here.'</p>

<p>We pulled up, and a few matches soon started a furious blaze
ahead of us that put us beyond all danger of being overtaken by
the larger conflagration.</p>

<p>One reads much of bush fires, but until a man sees a tract of
old-man spinifex in action one knows nothing of them. The clouds
of black smoke, half shrouding the leaping red flames, the roar
and tumult of the fire mingling with the wail of the miserable
trees as they bow their heads before it, and lift them with
foliage shrivelled and scorched. The excited whistle of the
swift-winged kites, keeping in front of the flames, and swooping
down upon the doomed vermin who only live in the waterless
country, and are forced to fly from the advancing destruction.
The slow-going crows, with their sepulchral croak, following the
red ruin, and garnering what the fire and the kites have left
them. All form a picture only to be witnessed in the heart of
Australia. The fire swept by us on either side, and as we rode
over the hot smoking ground we watched it unite with the one we
had started, and roar on to the westward.</p>

<p>All the rest of that day we rode over a blackened scene of
desolation, and camped at dusk on a patch of stony ground that
the fire had overleaped. We tied the horses up, for there was
nothing for them to eat, and they would otherwise only wander
afar in their hobbles. We were all gloomy and dispirited, and
spoke but little, munching our meal almost in silence. We
stretched ourselves on our blankets, and then commenced the
torment of the ants. In their creeping myriads they assailed us
from all sides. Sleep, the blessed, thing, beloved from pole to
pole, was impossible. All night we sat up, walked about, smoked,
and prayed for daylight.</p>

<p>Those who picture the Australian desert country as a
Sahara-like expanse of sand-blown plain may learn that the real
desert lies in the spinifex-covered sandstone rises. The rain,
when it falls, will turn the sandy plain into an oasis of
verdure, but on the barren sandstone ridge, come rain, come
drought, the conditions never alter. No bird life, but an
occasional weary kite winging his tired way to same distant
water, a belated owl, or the speckled, whirring quail. No animal
life but a startled bandicoot, or the prying bright-eyed little
lizard. And over all silence, day and night, silence so complete
that one welcomes the pound of the clinking hobble chains on the
horses as telling of something in the neighborhood that is
associated with one's fellow man. No shade by day, and the
infinite torment of flies; no rest by night for the infinite
torment of ants. And the cold, bright stars look down, unmoved,
unstirred, cold in their immortal calm though man is dying
beneath their gaze.</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown the next evening and our horses were
beginning to suffer somewhat when we emerged into a change of
country, and knew that we neared our destination. As we topped a
slight elevation a comparatively treeless expanse lay stretched
before us, and we saw what we took to be the blue expanse of a
lake, but which, in reality, was only salt mud; and the smoke of
a blacks' encampment on it bank. We rode hastily forward, for
this was the goal of our journey. The natives sprang to their
feet, and shouted as we approached, and then a white man advanced
to meet us.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">AMOS DRYANT was a man of good presence and of
taking manner. Even after living with the wild blacks for some
weeks he looked' neater and better cared for than either Dick
Munster or myself. That he was also a man endowed with strong
personality could be seen by the influence he had established
amongst the blacks.</p>

<p>'Friends!' he said joyously, 'Is it an accident, or did you by
chance get my message?'</p>

<p>'We got your message, and started at once. The message reached
us in three weeks, and it has taken us nearly a week to get
here,' replied Munster.</p>

<p>'Kind and generous men,' said Dryant; 'I thank you now, but I
will do more presently.'</p>

<p>Munster frowned.</p>

<p>'Look here, old man, don't talk like that. We came to rescue a
fellow white man, because we had the means at our command to do
it If we had not had the necessary material we should have passed
the job on to somebody who had. We don't want to hear anything
about recompense, it's not our style.'</p>

<p>'Where do the niggers get their water?' I interrupted, 'our
horses will be getting into that salt bog directly.'</p>

<p>'Oh, I will show you,' said Dryant nastily, and he led us to
where three or four wells had been dug, about a hundred yards
back from the saline swamp. We soon had the horses watered and a
camp fixed. There was plenty of good feed in the neighborhood,
and for the first time for two nights we felt restful and
contented. We had brought out presents for the niggers, some of
which we had distributed on the road. We gave the remainder to
Dryant to give to his friends, and they retired to their camp
happy, and left us alone. Dryant was enjoying the luxury of an
unaccustomed pipe, and Dick and I were smoking silently. Somehow
I did not feel the pleasure I had anticipated in the successful
issue of our adventure. Suddenly Dryant knocked out his pipe, sat
up, and commenced his yarn.</p>

<p><br>
'WE started out from the head of the Gascoyne, Lawson, myself,
and the black boy. When we got over the watershed we reached a
long stretch of level country, sometimes grassed, at other times
covered with spinifex and patches of mulga scrub. We had five
camels with us, and got along very well for about 300 miles, but
found no country worth prospecting. Then we got into low, stony
ridges, and found a little show in some of the gullies, but
nothing to pay. Beyond we found some big quartz blows, and one of
them seemed pretty rich, quite good enough to go back to. This
side we had a long, dry stage to cross. We had been two days on
it, when one morning we were packing up, when we were surprised
by a lot of natives, who had crept up to us, crawling through a
bit of undergrowth, near where we were camped. The camels were
not roped, and in the confusion of beating the niggers off, they
cleared out, with the exception of one the black boy managed to
stick to, and we never saw them again. By the time we had
polished off the blacks we found ourselves left stranded on a dry
stage, with one camel.</p>

<p>'We packed him with all we deemed most necessary, and put the
rest of our traps together in as safe a place as we could find,
then started to walk. The next day we made a brackish spring, and
then came a singular discovery. We came to a patch of fine,
well-watered country, open, rolling downs were grassed with
little; square-topped knolls scattered through it, some of them
showing quartz seams, which we examined, and found auriferous.
Suddenly the blackboy uttered an exclamation of affright, and we
saw him staring wildly ahead, and pointing with his finger.
Following the direction, we saw the cause of his fright. Standing
at the foot of one of the little knolls were about half a dozen
deer. The stag, an old one, with large horns, was in front, and
the terror of the blackboy was explained.</p>

<p>'The deer did not seem much alarmed, but on our approach they
cantered away. It was Lawson's turn next to cry out, and no
wonder; he had come upon a row of stones just showing above the
surface, and these stones had been squared by hand.'</p>

<p>Dryant paused, but neither, of us made any comment. Fact is,
we thought the man either off his head, or a liar.</p>

<p>He resumed</p>

<p>'These stones seemed to lead straight ahead, and looked like
the top of a wall that had been earthed up. They ran for nearly a
hundred yards, and then ceased. There was a spring there, and
we camped and proceeded to investigate. We found nothing that day
beyond ascertaining that it was the top of a wall of squared
stones, but on the next we found an opening in the ground, and
when we had cleared it away we found rough stone steps descending
seemingly into the bowels of the earth. We fixed up some lights,
and went down these steps, which, after all, did not go very far.
The air was dank and mouldy-smelling, but not poisonous, and we
looked round the place where we found ourselves, and to our
astonishment saw that we were in a little chapel with painted
walls. The painting was rude, but good enough for us to
understand. The subject was always the same, although differently
treated&mdash;blacks, natives, being converted by a party of
priests. In some they were being baptised, in some they were
kneeling before an uplifted crucifix; and in others they were
lying dead, and white angels were rising from their bodies.</p>

<p>'There was a large carved crucifix fallen on the ground, that
had formerly stood upright, and there were many relics of some
sort or another lying about in more or less perfect preservation.
It was rather oppressive down there, so after a bit we came to
the surface and investigated there, but could make nothing of it,
beyond that a change in the formation of the surface had taken;
place.'</p>

<p>Dryant ceased.</p>

<p>'Is that all?' asked Munster.</p>

<p>'Yes, we started in here to get a fresh outfit, and got on the
dry stage that finished us. Lawson knocked up and died, as I told
you; the blackboy went to a smoke, and never came back; and I
kept on until the camel gave in, and when I was just at the last
gasp, a party, of these fellows came along and carried me to
water.'</p>

<p>'How far away are these ruins?'</p>

<p>'Across the dry belt, about one hundred and fifty miles, I
should say.'</p>

<p>'Can we get out there with our horses?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Now you could, for a heavy thunderstorm has fallen since I
came here, and there are rock holes there that would hold water
for months.'</p>

<p>'Well, we have plenty of rations, and our horses are in good
fettle; what do you say to going out now, at once?' asked
Munster.</p>

<p>'I'm agreeable,' I replied. 'We're here now, and it's not
worth while going back to the station.'</p>

<p>'What do you say, Mr. Dryant, will you come? We brought a
spare horse and saddle for you to ride back on.'</p>

<p>For some reason I thought that Dryant did not like the notion
of my going to this place immediately, but he answered readily
enough.</p>

<p>'Very well, I will go back with you, and take you there.'</p>

<p>'That's settled then,' said Munster. 'Horses to-morrow,
piccaninny, daylight,' he called out to Coconut, who kept close
to us, and had not made friends with the blacks.</p>

<p>'How do you account for the ruins?' I asked Dryant.</p>

<p>'Only the one way. Australia was visited by early Christian
missionaries centuries ago; a thousand years, perhaps. They
formed a colony and converted many of the natives. Some
catastrophe blotted them out.'</p>

<p>The stars were still shining when we finished our breakfast
and started packing up, and with the pink flush of dawn at our
backs we started on our way to the mysterious ruins. It was a
dreary ride through the dry desert country, but we made a long
stage, and reached one of the rock holes Dryant had spoken of. As
he had predicted, the thunderstorm, had replenished it, and it
was now full.</p>

<p>Next day the way was just as weary, and about 4 o'clock we
came to another rock hole tolerably full, but evidently it had
only felt the outskirts of the storm. We watered out horses and
then pushed on till after dark, as Dryant said that there was a
strip of grass country on ahead. When we reached it we camped,
and reckoned that the next day, if the travelling was decent, we
might reach the edge of the patch of good country, which Dryant
described as equal to anything in Australia.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said Munster in camp that night, 'didn't you say
that the boy went after a smoke and never came back?'</p>

<p>'Funny the fire didn't travel at all; the spinifex is dry
enough; but we passed over no burnt country.'</p>

<p>'It was a fire right enough,' returned Dryant.</p>

<p>Next day, towards afternoon the scrub began to close in on us,
making progress with the pack horses slow and difficult.</p>

<p>Suddenly we emerged from the scrub without warning, and found
ourselves on the summit of a low, sloping rise, looking over one
of the most picturesque scenes I ever saw in Australia. The
gentle waves, the open country, timbered here and there with
slumps of trees and bushes, stretched to the western horizon.
Broken by the quaint little square-topped knolls or hillocks that
Dryant had spoken of, dotted about here and there. On either hand
of us the line of black scrub extended north and south like a
boundary wall, separating fertility from desolation. It only
wanted a lofty tier of ranges in the background to complete the
picture; but that, of course, we could not expect in
Australia.</p>

<p>After a long pause of admiration we rode on to where Dryant
said there was spring, and turned our horses on to the luxuriant
feed. Poor devils, they had been on short commons for two
nights.</p>

<p>Next morning we were early in the saddle, and in a couple of
hours' time had reached the camp of Dryant and his unlucky
mates.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">OUR first inspection was of what Dryant had
called the top of a wall; but both Munster and I agreed that it
was the beginning of a large and ambitions building. The stones
were neatly laid and fairly well squared, the workmanship, though
rough, having evidently been carried out on an orderly way. We
next went to the buried chapel, and, being well provided with
candles, were able to inspect it and its strange contents with
ease.</p>

<p>Truly, the paintings were, astounding, both from the effect
produced by the common pigments used, and the marvellous state of
preservation they were in. There were four large pictures
evidently intended for the education of the natives. In one they
were represented horrible and bestial in appearance, fighting and
dancing mad war dances. In the next they knelt before a group of
monks, who stood beside a cross and preached to them. In the
third they were receiving baptism, and now they were represented
without any of the wild appearance of the early picture; their
weapons lay neglected on the ground, a sign that they had
abandoned their savage warfare. The last of the series
represented the souls of the dead blacks ascending to heaven in
the guise of white angels. Though painted without perspective,
they were sufficiently graphic and realistic to at once attract
the attention of a savage, and moreover there was a rude kind of
genius displayed in their execution that was especially marked.
There were many other smaller paintings, chiefly portraying the
crucifixion. Evidently the work was one of very early
Christianity. The large crucifix that had fallen dawn was
fashioned out of mulga, and ingeniously carved. As a relic it was
priceless. It was nearly fossilised.</p>

<p>We ascended again, and Munster proposed that we should take a
ride round and try and discover any more remains of this ancient
mission station. Dryant excused himself on the plea of fatigue.
Coconut went with us to mind our horses if we had to explore any
place on foot. We were away a long time, but found nothing
except, from the shape of one of the knolls, we judged to be the
quarry from which the stone had been obtained; but any actual
signs of work time and weather had obliterated.</p>

<p>It was nearly 4 o'clock when we returned to camp, and found it
deserted. There was no sign of Dryant anywhere. Shouting and
cooeeing produced no answer; nor did he turn up before dark. We
indulged in many surmises, but could make no guesses at it.
Wherever he had gone, then he had gone on foot, for none of the
horses was away. We could do nothing till morning, except keep a
good fire burning, and fire off an occasional shot to let him
know the position of the camp. During the night both Munster and
I were haunted by on idea that we would hear a noise like muffled
shouting or shrieking. We only heard it when we were lying down.
On sitting up to listen all was silent. This, combined with the
strange absence of Dryant, caused us to pass a restless
night.</p>

<p>At the earliest dawn we were about looking for tracks, but
could not do any good. Our horses had fed close round and round
the camp, and obliterated all tracks. The day passed in a
fruitless search. We visited the chapel again and examined it
thoroughly, but found nothing more than we had seen before.</p>

<p>That night I was awakened by a movement in the camp, and
opening my eyes, without moving, I saw, in the dying moonlight, a
dark figure prowling round our pack bags. Munster lay within
reach, of me, and I managed to quietly awaken him. The figure was
stooping, with its back towards us, and simultaneously we both
sprang up end rushed at. It was a naked blackfellow, and after an
ineffectual struggle he gave in, and we led him up to the fire.
To our astonishment he addressed us in tolerable English, and
explained that he was taking some rations for a whitefellow.</p>

<p>'What name whitefellow?' asked Munster.</p>

<p>'Lawson,' said the boy to our amazement.</p>

<p>'What for Lawson no come up?' I asked. The boy, whom we had
released, for he evidently had no intention of running away,
tapped his forehead and shook his head. Evidently Lawson was out
of his mind. We made the fire up, gave the boy, whose name was
Monday, a feed, and while he ate he told his story.</p>

<p>That he was the boy who had accompanied Dryant and Lawson we
already guessed; and his tale was as follows:</p>

<p><br>
SOON after the start the two commenced quarrelling, the row
having arisen through Lawson having in his possession what, from
the boy's description, was evidently a woman's photograph. All
through the trip the dissensions grew more and more bitter,
until, according to Monday, he daily expected to see them shoot
one another. The loss of the camels put a stop to it for a time
in their common misfortune, but it broke out worse than ever
after their arrival in the good country and discovery of the
ancient mission chapel.</p>

<p>One day, when Monday was absent from the camp doing a bit of
hunting, he returned to find Lawson had vanished. Dryant told him
that Lawson had gone on by himself, and told him to help pack the
camel, as he was going to start after him that night.</p>

<p>They started, but saw no sign of Lawson. Then he grew
suspicious, and determined to bolt at the first opportunity, for
he concluded Dryant had killed Lawson, and would kill him next.
When they were travelling the next day he pretended to see a
smoke close handy, and went off to look at it, and as soon as he
was clear away he made back as hard as he could. He arrived at
the place where we then were at the end of the third day's
absence. He laid down to rest and think. He was Lawson's boy,
having been with him before the two joined, and he did not own
any allegiance to Dryant.</p>

<p>While resting he heard the same strange sounds that had
disturbed us. They frightened him terribly at first, but being
sharp-eared, he recognised something in the mysterious voice
resembling has missing master's. He recovered his courage, and
traced the sounds to a patch of scrub close at the back of our
camp. He finally located them as coming from under a big round
boulder that was there. He tried to move the boulder, but it
resisted his efforts, until he worked round to one particular
side, and then it rolled away easily. Below the boulder was a
large hole, and from this hole came the voice of has master.</p>

<p>How to get him out he did not know; but at last, fortunately,
having taken his tomahawk with him when he bolted&mdash;a
blackfellow never forgets that&mdash;he thought of cutting down a
couple of saplings and putting them down the hole, and by the aid
of these Lawson clambered up until Monday could get hold of him.
The poor wretch had been three days, in this horrible prison,
which was a large underground cave, the hole being in the roof.
He was nearly exhausted and half mad when Monday rescued him.</p>

<p>When he had drunk his fill he went off in a stupor, and so
remained for a long time. When he recovered, his brain was
obscured, and he was insane, and talked continually to
himself.</p>

<p>When we afterwards came to examine the cave and its occupants
we did not wonder at that. Monday had kept himself and the
unfortunate man alive by hunting ever since. On our arrival
Lawson had hidden, his senses partly returned&mdash;enough to
make him mature a plain of revenge. While we were away they had
stolen on Dryant, overpowered him, and dragged him to the hole
and thrown him headlong into the cave, then replaced the
boulder.</p>

<p>'And is he there still?' cried Munster, jumping up. The boy
nodded in the most matter-of-fact way.</p>

<p>'Come on; show us where it is. We must get him out!' And we
hastened to the spot.</p>

<p>It was not many yards from, our camp, but the undergrowth had
concealed it from our view. Monday showed us the side to tackle
the boulder, and it rolled easily off the hole.</p>

<p>'Dryant!' I cried. There was no answer. I called again, but
all was silent. He had either sunk into unconsciousness or death.
We brought lights, and peered into the ghastly oubliette, but the
lights were not strong enough.</p>

<p>'We must go down,' I said.</p>

<p>With surcingles and tent-rope, we had soon a line ready, and
made fast. Munster went first. It was about twelve feet to the
floor of the cave. I followed, and held the candles aloft.</p>

<p>It was a fairly large cavern, with a few stalactites in it;
but the contents! O horror!</p>

<p>The cavern was of limestone origin, and around lay heaps of
human bones and skulls fossilised by the water that occasionally
flooded the place; now it was dry. Dryant's body lay on the
floor, his face hideously disfigured and mangled. With a
sickening shudder, we noticed the cause. A huge lace lizard, the
flesh-eating iguana, gorged and asleep, lay coiled alongside the
dead man.</p>

<p>Both our revolvers cracked together, and the obscene reptile
stretched himself out, quivering in death. Then from dark corners
and nooks, hideous creeping things came out and looked at us with
hungry eyes. Startled bats brushed our faces with soft, repulsive
wings, and the place seemed full of horrible and unnatural
creations.</p>

<p>We fired again at the foremost of them, and then a stalactite
fell with a crash to the ground, and they disappeared to cracks
and crannies.</p>

<p>'Get the body out quick, or we shall both go mad,' I called
out, springing forward. We put our candles down, and carried the
mangled corpse to the hole, made fast the end of our line round
the shoulders and swarmed up ourselves, as quick as we could. We
drew the body up, and laid the poor wretch on the ground, and
covered the half-eaten face in a handkerchief. Then we rolled the
boulder back and closed the mouth of that hellish pit, I hope
forever.</p>

<p>We went to camp, and Munster got out a bottle of brandy we had
brought in case of accidents, and we both drank about two strong
nips rolled into one.</p>

<p>'By heavens! I shall dream of that place all my life,' I
said.</p>

<p>'Fancy that unfortunate man being down there for three days.
Ugh! No wonder he is mad.'</p>

<p>I asked Monday if he knew where to find Lawson and take him
some food. He said he did, and we sent him off, telling him to do
his best to get Lawson to come to us in the morning.</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of the bones in that place?' I asked, when
we were smoking. 'They had been there for centuries&mdash;they
are stone now.'</p>

<p>'I thought it might have been a burial place at first,'
returned Munster, 'but from the way that boulder blocked the
entrance I think something worse.</p>

<p>'What's that?'</p>

<p>'Once a man was put down there, and the stone rolled over,
escape would be utterly impossible, wouldn't it?'</p>

<p>'It would.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps refractory heathens who refused to accept
Christianity were put down there for the glory of God. Worse,
or as bad, was done in America. And also up here in the
East Indies.'</p>

<p>We were silent for some time, both thinking what had better
not be put on paper.</p>

<p>'I wonder how Dryant got Lawson down there?'</p>

<p>'Unless he recovers his senses we shall never know. Probably
they found the place, and Lawson foolishly descended to look at
it. The rest would be easy.'</p>

<p>'Good gracious,' I said, 'why, that hateful place comes right
underneath, here. If there are any cracks about some of these
amiable creatures may pay us a visit.'</p>

<p>'Don't talk about such things,' said Munster; and we dozed and
chatted till daylight.</p>

<p>At daylight we dug a grave, and were about to bury his body,
when Monday and Lawson came up. He seemed quiet, but quite
foolish, although he smiled and shook hands with us. We had sewn
the corpse up in a blanket, so Lawson did not see it. We lowered
it in the grave, and I said what I could remember of the burial
service over it. Then we filled it in, and devoted our attention
to the living.</p>

<p>We remained there nearly a week trying to find some clue to
the story and fate of the heroic men who had penetrated the
centre of ancient Australia and built a Christian chapel. But all
our trouble was useless. Where they came from and what was the
catastrophe which smote them we could not find out. Time had
choked up their buildings, had buried their secrets, and the
pictures on the chapel wall only told of their life-work. The
mystery was as impenetrable as the presence of the little herd of
deer one of which we vainly tried to get a shot at.</p>

<p>Before leaving we put a cross over poor Dryant's grave. Poor
devil, he paid heavily for his sin of attempted murder. Lawson
was perfectly quiet, and seemed to partly understand us, but the
shock to his brain had been terrible, and no wonder.</p>

<p>The weather was favorable and we got home by easy stages. We
saw Lawson placed under medical care. His family, residing in
Melbourne, took, charge of him. I hear he is recovering, but all
allusions to the past have to be avoided. Munster gladly took the
faithful Monday into his employ. He has written down to me to get
a camera ready, and come up and join him in another trip out
there next year.</p>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>25. &mdash; THE HORROR OF LESTON DOWNS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 8 Aug 1896</h3>

<p class="first">THE station was seemingly deserted. There were
no fresh tracks about, the ashes of the kitchen fire were cold
and lifeless. Save for that, everything bore the appearance of
habitation&mdash;nothing disturbed or in confusion, the three
legged pot hanging in the fireplace had a piece of sodden beef in
the greasy water, a dishful of thick sour milk stood on a shelf,
and there were two or three small loaves of hard, stale
bread.</p>

<p>'What do you make of it, Denver?' I asked my companion.</p>

<p>'Make of it? I can make nothing of it. Let's go through the
house.'</p>

<p>We did so, but the puzzle only grew more complex. Everything,
again, was in order and undisturbed. A half-finished letter in
the handwriting of Irving, the owner of the station, lay on the
table in the little skillion room he used as an office. What to
think of it we did not know.</p>

<p>'How long is it since you saw Irving?' I asked Denver.</p>

<p>'Not more than ten days ago. He was over at my place.'</p>

<p>'Did he seem himself?'</p>

<p>'Well, not quite; he had some queer tricks I never noticed
before. He kept starting suddenly, and wiping his face with his
handkerchief, then looking at the handkerchief as though he
expected to find some stain on it.'</p>

<p>'Don't suppose he's gone mad, and killed everybody on the
station, How many were there here?'</p>

<p>'Himself, two men, and a cook, and a colored gardener. No; I
don't think he has had a fit of homicidal mania, although he was
a most passionate fellow.'</p>

<p>'What was the colored gardener? A Chinaman?'</p>

<p>'No. Hanged if I know where he came from&mdash;Java, I think.
He was a good gardener, but a sullen, morose fellow.'</p>

<p>'Well, let's try and knock up a feed of some sort. Wonder
where the key of the store is?'</p>

<p>We found the key of the store, and got something eatable out
of it, then sat down to our meal, and discussed the strange
desertion of the station.</p>

<p>Suddenly Denver sprang up with a naughty exclamation.</p>

<p>'Look at my plate,' he said.</p>

<p>It was spotted with fresh dropped blood!</p>

<p>'It was not there when I sat down, and yours! Look&mdash;look
at yours!'</p>

<p>By heavens, mine was the same!</p>

<p>We stared at each other in consternation.</p>

<p>'Let's start home,' said my companion. 'My appetite is
ruined.'</p>

<p>He picked up the bridles, and went down the little home
paddock for our horses.</p>

<p>I strolled towards the garden, which had been formed near the
edge of the lagoon the station had been built on. It looked well,
and spoke favorably for the care it had received; it had not been
left untended long enough to yet show any signs of neglect. I
entered the hut of the colored gardener. It was neat and tidy,
but what instantly attracted nay attention was a large sheet of
newspaper fastened to the wall. On it, daubed in vivid red, was
an Oriental sign of some sort covering nearly the whole of the
double newspaper. I cooeed to Denver, and presently he came
down.</p>

<p>'What's the meaning of that?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Can't say. Looks like some obi business. See, there's been a
fire burning in front of it.'</p>

<p>He stooped down and looked at the ashes, then smelt them.</p>

<p>'Queer; smells like pastille ashes.'</p>

<p>He had been rubbing up a pipeful of tobacco between the palms
of his hands as he spoke. Suddenly he dropped it on the ground
with an oath. He held his hands out to me. They were stained, as
though he had been squeezing blood out of the tobacco.</p>

<p>'Come away,' he said; 'the place is cursed.'</p>

<p>We left the hut, and he washed and scrubbed his hands in one
of the little trenches which still held some standing water.</p>

<p>We discussed the strange thing as we rode home through the
moonlit night, but neither of us could arrive at any reasonable
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>The next evening we were smoking in the verandah of Denver's
place, when we noticed a horseman approaching. He rode up to the
rail where we generally hung up our houses, dismounted, and
walked up to the house.</p>

<p>'It's Irving,' said Denver quietly, as he rose to meet
him.</p>

<p>It was the ghost of Irving. Haggard, worn, and thin, with
haunted eyes, he came towards us.</p>

<p>'Give me something to eat, Den,' he said, in a tired and
hollow voice.</p>

<p>'Tea will be in directly,' replied Denver. 'Come and have a
wash, old man, and I'll tell one of the boys to let your horse
go.'</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' said Irving, sinking into one of the canvas
chairs, and sitting staring moodily in front of him.</p>

<p>'We were over at your place yesterday,' I remarked, the
silence feeling awkward.</p>

<p>'I saw the tracks,' he returned shortly.</p>

<p>'Where are the men?' asked Denver.</p>

<p>'Left, and gone in to the township.'</p>

<p>'And the gardener?'</p>

<p>'Muzra Khem. I've been hunting for him.'</p>

<p>We were all silent until the clatter of plates announced the
incoming of the meal. 'I will go to your room, Den,' said Irving,
rising.</p>

<p>At meal time we avoided the subject uppermost in our minds,
and talked, on indifferent local matters. Irving ate
voraciously&mdash;the man was actually famished. At times he
looked suspiciously at his plate and his food, but nothing
happened. We both suspected that he was looking for the ghastly
blood drops.</p>

<p>The night was calm and mild, and we had eat smoking in the
verandah for some tune, when Irving suddenly said:</p>

<p>'Did anything strange happen to you when you were over at my
place?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' returned Denver.</p>

<p>'Blood, I suppose?'</p>

<p>'Yes, blood appeared in the most mysterious manner on our
plates; we came away without eating.</p>

<p>'A fortnight ago,' went on Irving, 'Muzra Khem, who had been
long strange in manner, 'had a row with the cook and the other
men. He accused them of putting blood in his bread. I must tell
you that Muzra. Khem is a native of Sumatra, and belongs to some
mysterious sect or brotherhood, who are supposed to be possessed
of many occult secrets, mostly evil spells and curses. They are
strict vegetarians, and to taste blood or flesh is to them utter
damnation. I had warned the men to play no tricks, as he would
probably run amok if they did, nor do I think any trick was
played on him; the men all swore there was not. He only got bread
from the kitchen, and used to wait for it hot from the oven, so
that it could not accidentally touch meat or grease. The cook
could only explain matters by supposing that a bit of the red
yarn in the flour bag had got Into the flour and stained the
bread; anyhow Muzra Khem came up with an ugly looking knife in
his hand prepared to wipe them all out. We were going kill that
evening, and one of the men had just loaded the gun to shoot the
beast. He covered Muzra and made him halt, for he still had
sufficient sense for that, although if he had once commenced
stabbing, nothing but death would have stayed him. Finding
himself foiled, he came over to where I was standing in the
verandah. Walking up he commenced to explain his wrongs, and not
being in a good temper I told him to be off to the garden. Then
he burst out raving and, throwing the bread at my feet, made an
attempt to jump on the verandah, knife in hand, but I knocked him
down on his back, and before he got up had him covered with my
revolver.</p>

<p>'I ordered him to drop the knife. He did so, and then spat
twice in my face. You know what a fiendish temper I am afflicted
with. I lost all control over myself at this shameful insult from
a nigger, and it's a wonder that I did not kill him on the spot;
but a sweeter punishment suggested itself. I told the men, who
had come to my assistance, to go on up to the yard, and made
Muzra Khem go up too.</p>

<p>'When the beast was shot and stuck, I seized him, forced him
on his knees, and with all the strength of rage, bent his face
and mouth down to the gushing blood. Then I let him go. He got up
stiffly, for I must have nearly broken his neck. My senses
suddenly returned, and I would have given anything to have undone
what I had done when I saw the awful took of despair in the man's
eyes. If there is a hell, lost souls must wear that look.</p>

<p>'He looked round, at us with, those tormented eyes, then
stooped, dipped his hands in the blood, and, with a rapid
movement, sprinkled all of us with it. Then he passed out of the
yard, ran down to the lagoon and plunged in. We all knew he could
swim like a fish, so went on with our work.</p>

<p>'All that night there was a light in his hut, and I heard
sounds like some one chanting, for I could not sleep, in the
morning he was gone; and on the wall was a sheet of newspaper,
with some cabalistic sign scrawled on it in red. I tore it down
and burnt it.'</p>

<p>'It was there when we were there,' I said.</p>

<p>'That is the third time it has been replaced, which shows that
he is still hanging about. That morning the curse of the blood
drops commenced, I came over here, meaning to tell you, Den, but
when it came to the point I feared your laughing at me. When I
went home I found the men with their horses saddled waiting for
me. They were good fellows, who had been with me some time, but I
could not blame them. I would have done the same myself. Next the
blacks all left, and I was quite alone.' He paused.</p>

<p>'What have you been doing since?' asked Denver.</p>

<p>'Hunting for Muzra Khem. When I find him I'll torture him to
death, but I'll make him take the curse off.'</p>

<p>Denver got up. 'Old man,' he said, 'what you want is a long
sleep. Come and have a real good second mate's nip, and then turn
in.'</p>

<p>Irving rose, and we went inside.</p>

<p>I looked quietly in his room the next morning and he was
sleeping soundly.</p>

<p>'Let him sleep,' said Denver, 'It is what he wants.'</p>

<p>It was nearly eleven o'clock before he woke. He seemed much
more composed, breakfasted well, and though both Denver and I
offered to accompany him, he declined, and rode off home alone. A
week afterwards be visited us again, looking a different man.</p>

<p>'I've shifted it,' he said, after the greetings were over.</p>

<p>'And Muzra Khem?' asked Denver.</p>

<p>'Please, old friend, don't ask me any questions. Muzra Khem is
still alive. Let that suffice. I will stay here to-night, and
tomorrow morning I want you boys to come back with me, and, if
you can spare the time, stay a few days while I either get my old
lads back or fresh ones.'</p>

<p>We agreed cordially, glad to see things straightened up again.
Irving got the old men back; he was a popular man, like most
fiery tempered men, who have a thing out and have done with it.
It is the nagging men who are disliked. The story had, of course,
spread, but it had been laughed at naturally, and the talk soon
died out Irving, it was noticed, put great constraint on his
temper ever since the Muzra Khem incident, but he never unclosed
his lips about the means he had used to bring that gentleman to
reason.</p>

<p>Only he confided to Denver that he was engaged to a girl down
south, of whom he was passionately fond, and that he would have
shot himself if he had not succeeded in lifting the curse of
blood. He also assured Denver that he had only used a dire and
inhuman threat to Muzra Khem, but had not injured him, that
having been sufficient I had left the district for some time when
I received a letter from Denver.</p>

<p>'Wretched news, old fellow,' he wrote. 'Our poor friend Irving
was murdered in his bed the very night before he was starting
south to get married. He was stabbed to the heart with a dagger,
and on the handle was tied a paper with the following legend on
it. It was written in what was meant to be English, and I have
straightened it out, and send you its purport:'</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
I, Muzra Khem, once of the select, now a beast, did this
thing to the white devil who made me a beast. The white devil
caught me after I had put the curse of the dripping blood on him
and all of his. He was very quiet, but his hands were of iron,
and he bound me to a tree, fastening my arms behind me. Then he
drove pegs in the ground and fastened my ankles thereto, so that
the dead could have moved as easily as I. Then he looked into my
eyes and spoke:</p>

<p class="letter">'Muzra Khem, how many hells are there?'</p>

<p class="letter">'I answered "Seven."'</p>

<p class="letter">'And after I have killed you where will your soul go?'</p>

<p class="letter">'Into the body of a tiger, and for a thousand
years I shall roam about thirsting for blood.'</p>

<p class="letter">The white devil laughed.</p>

<p class="letter">'There won't be many tigers left in a hundred
years, let alone a thousand. What becomes of those who go to the
seventh hell?'</p>

<p class="letter">'None dare tell,' I answered.</p>

<p class="letter">
'But I know,' he said. 'It is the eaters of men's flesh,
who go to the seventh hell. Muzra Khem, unless you remove the
curse of blood from me and mine, you shall go to the bottom of
that hell. Listen! I will cut pieces of your flesh off, and you
shall eat them before me.'</p>

<p class="letter">
'I looked in that white devil's eyes, and saw that he had
power over me, and I bowed my head, for I knew he would do what
he said.</p>

<p class="letter">
'I will take off the curse of the dripping blood,' I
answered. 'And never curse me again. By what will you swear?'</p>

<p class="letter">
'I will swear by the seven trees with the seven branches
which only the wise have seen,' I replied.</p>

<p class="letter">'It is enough,' he said, and released me.</p>

<p class="letter">
We went back to the station, and I took off the curse of
the dripping blood, but I did not swear that I would not kill him
when his eyes were closed, for when they were open they had power
over me. It is done.</p>

<p><br>
'Of course,' added Denver; 'the hue and cry is after Muzra,
but in my humble flippin' opinion they'll have to go tiger
hunting to find him.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>26. &mdash; FATE OF KITTYCRUMMIE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 15 Oct 1898</h3>

<p class="first">SOME cooks are pre-eminently distinguished by an
ability to make themselves disagreeable. True, this is a
privilege accorded to all cooks, whose despotic power in the
kitchen is supposed to be a thing not to be crossed, unless the
culprit feels inclined to chance the wrath that will inevitably
ensue, but the cantankerousness of Jack Walters went something
beyond this. He was a scrupulously clean man for one thing, and
the luckless inhabitants of the men's hut never knew what
unwritten law they were transgressing.</p>

<p>If a man picked up a pannikin to have a drink, Walters would
watch him with unwinking eyes, and if he offered to put it back
in its place, wet and dripping, then Walters would solemnly hand
him a towel, with a look of withering and sarcastic scorn. And
the culprit would feel bound to polish that pannikin up dry and
bright before he restored it to its place.</p>

<p>Walters's power lay in moral persuasion. He was not exactly a
fighting man, but he had enough incarnated unsociability to make
the lives of all hands uncomfortable. The effect of his power was
that he was a good cook. A rattling good cook&mdash;in fact, a
perfect genius. A lesser man would not have been tolerated a
moment, but every body on the station where Walters worked licked
satisfactory lips, and put up with hits bad temper.</p>

<p>Walters had a dog, as unsatisfactory a member of canine
society as Walters was of human society. He was a big gaunt dog,
faithful to his master, and snarling towards everybody else but
one who could take his own part, and it was only by superior
numbers that the other station dogs ever got on level terms with
him.</p>

<p>Walters lived for long on Windook Station, distinguished by
several virtues. His good cooking and love of cleanliness, his
affection for Hooker, his dog, and his hatred of the blacks. He
saw men come and go, and even superintendents change, but Walters
and Hooker went on just the same. It came to pass, in the days of
a super named Lesteen, that the catastrophe happened which
brought to light the hidden mystery of Walters's past life, and
his evident misanthropical turn.</p>

<p>Hooker picked up a bait, and all attempts to save him, mustard
emetics and the cutting off of his tail and ears, did not
avail, and he died in the great agony induced by strychnine
poisoning. From that hour Walters became a changed man. He faded
and waited away, became quite amiable, gave the men jam tarts and
fat cakes every day, and at last took to his bed and announced
his intention of dying.</p>

<p>A messenger had come to ask Lesteen to go down and interview
the dying cook just as a traveller arrived the station. Lesteen
went down in response to the urgent message, and found Walters
alone in his bunk; the sleeping accommodation was partitioned off
from the kitchen, and the men had all cleared out and left it to
Walters.</p>

<p>He seemed pretty bad, and when Lesteen sat down by him, and
asked him how he felt, he answered that he wasn't long for this
world, but before he died he wanted to tell what had so long
weighed on his mind.</p>

<p>'Would Lesteen listen to him?'</p>

<p>Lesteen would do anything to oblige him, and listened
patiently while Walters told his story.</p>


<h3><i>The Cook's Story</i></h3>

<p class="first">
I WAS at sea once, and with me was a brother of whom I was
very fond. He was a sailor, and I was cook. I was enabled to
fatten him up well, and when the catastrophe occurred he was in
excellent condition. We were on a trading barque in the Pacific,
a bona fide trader, not a blackbirder, and were doing very well.
Unfortunately the skipper took it into his head to trade up at
New Britain, then not much frequented. We got on all right for
some time, then the natives got saucy, and one morning at
daybreak they boarded tho barque, and there was a horrible
massacre.</p>

<p>Strange to say, my brother and myself were the only ones left
alive, besides my dog Hooker. We were taken ashore, and the
niggers having tasted some of my cookery, when they had come
board the barque, made me cook for them. And what do you think I
had to cook for them? Why, the darned cannibals! The bodies of
most of my shipmates. However, I did it for the sake of my
brother, who was fat and fair and plump, and I made sure I would
have to cook him in the end&mdash;that they were only keeping him
for a tit-bit. Well, on his account I did my best, though I had a
bad job with the boatswain, who was a tough subject to make a
tasty dish of.</p>

<p>There was a rather nice young girl there, the favorite
daughter of the chief; her name was Kittycrummie. She took a
great fancy to my brother, and I told him that now was his chance
to up and marry her, and live with the tribe until he saw a
chance of getting away. As for me&mdash;since I had been cooking
for them they had become regular gourmands, and wouldn't have
lost me on any account. Fellows say I'm proud of my cooking; but
who wouldn't be when he'd make a tribe of cannibal New Britons
sit up, and understand good dishes.</p>

<p>Davy wouldn't have anything to say to Kittytrummie, who was
plump and pretty, because he had a girl of his own in Sydney, and
he said he wasn't going back on her. And all I could say to him
would do no good. Finally they took him away, and put him in a
bamboo cage, and there he would have to stay until he consented
to marry Kittycrummie, which he vowed he would never do.</p>

<p>I did all I could to persuade him to give in, but no, he
wouldn't budge an inch, and finally I was forbidden to go and see
him. One day, some time afterwards, the under cooks brought me
some 'long pig' (human flesh) to cook, and it was fat and juicy
and tender. I was just about starting to work at it, when a
thought struck me, and I demanded to know whose flesh it was, for
they had so flayed it with their horrid bamboo knives, that you
couldn't tell whether it was white or black.</p>

<p>True enough they told me it was my brother's, who had been
dispatched because he wouldn't marry Kittycrummie. Then I went
mad, and it was not until they had nearly thumped the life out of
me that I consented to cook the grub. Only then for a special
reason. Amongst the scores they had brought ashore, was a bottle
of strychnine, and I managed to get hold of it. I cooked Davy,
and seasoned him with strychnine. Now, I was in the habit of
feeding Hooker when I was cooking, but from this particular lot
of joints he wouldn't touch a single morsel, and I've honored and
loved him ever since. He knew it was Davy, and now the dear dog's
dead I don't want to live.</p>

<p>Well, the feast came off, and didn't they howl and yell when
the strychnine began to take effect. Lord, they tied themselves
up in knots, and rolled over in the worst kind of cramps, and all
the while I laughed at them, and jeered at them in their agony.
But though I looked everywhere when daylight came, I couldn't see
anything of Kittycrummie.</p>

<p>I was searching about, when I heard a gun at sea. I looked
out, and there were two gunboats, a Dutch and English one. Both
sent crews ashore. They both came up to me together, but when the
Dutch officer found I was an Englishman he saluted the English
officer, and left me in his hands. Well, I told them all about
it, and the lieutenant said that he would make the report all
right, and I wouldn't have any trouble at all. He'd make out that
a sudden contagious kind of malarial fever had swept over New
Britain, and they found that the natives had died in their
camps.</p>

<p>They were very good to me, and took me and Hooker down to
Cooktown, and got up a subscription for us on board. But I've
never been able to take to my fellow kind since, always thinking
how they'd taste in pies, and now that Hooker's gone I haven't a
mate in the world.'</p>

<p><br>
WALTERS had just finished when one of the men came in, and
asked Lesteen if he would mind coming out, and seeing the
traveller who was very anxious to see him. Lesteen went out. The
man was short and square in build.</p>

<p>'I'm looking for my brother,' he said, 'his name Is Walters;
but the fellows say he's that bad I can't see him. Can't I,
boss?'</p>

<p>'Is your name Davy?'</p>

<p>'It is.'</p>

<p>'Go in, then, at once.'</p>

<p>The man went behind the partition, and Lesteen beard a shriek
of horror. He went in fearing the surprise would be too much.</p>

<p>'Davy, Davy!' said the cook, 'how did you escape?'</p>

<p>'Kittycrummie took my place; put on my clothes, and was killed
instead of me. Dear girl, why did I not requite her
affection?'</p>

<p>'Then it was Kittycrummie whom I cooked, and poisoned the
whole crew with.'</p>

<p>'It was. I got taken off by the Dutch gunboat to Batavia, and
was stranded there without any money.'</p>

<p>'Fancy! Poor Hooker. He wouldn't touch a bit of Kitty. I
remember he was very fond of her. I think I'll get up and start
cooking Davy, you must be hungry.'</p>

<p>'I am,' said Davy; and his brother got up and recovered.</p>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>27. &mdash; THE LAND OF WAIT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 6 Nov 1897</h3>

<p class="first">THE fever of the north of Queensland had had me
is its grip for weeks. There seemed to be nothing to be desired
in life but one long, long drink of cold, clear water. To my
parched palate the water out of the cooling water bag tasted of
canvas and cattle camps.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when the pains that reached every joint were not so
bad as usual, I could shut I my eyes and dream of all the purling
brooks I had seen in more temperate climes. I remember looking
around and noting everything just before the strange thing I am
going to relate happened to me. The rough slabs of the but I was
lying in, the scorching iron roof, Jack lying on his bunk
smoking, and the big fireplace full of white ashes. Then I closed
my eyes, for the ache in my limbs had left me for a while, and I
thought I could sleep.</p>

<p>'Strange,' said a soft voice, apparently just above me, 'but
all who come here look as though they had passed through much
pain, weariness, and trouble, or else they are mutilated and
mangled.'</p>

<p>'Why strange?' answered another voice as soft and soothing as
the first. 'Why strange? You know what they have had to go
through on earth, and what we escaped.'</p>

<p>'True,' said the first speaker,' we escaped much.'</p>

<p>I opened my eyes to see if I was dreaming or I not. It was
soft and misty all round, and I could not clearly distinguish
things at first, but I managed to make out two indistinct forms
near where I was lying. One of them approached me, I and held a
vessel of some sort to my lips, while the other assisted me to
rise; the touch was substantial enough. I drank. What the draught
I was I know not, but it brought back strength, health at one
bound, and, for the time, oblivion of the past. I felt no longer
strange to the place; I felt as though in my rightful home. I
could see plainly, too; the misty twilight no longer I obscured
my sight. I was in a land like the earth, but far more I
beautiful. If you can imagine the earth freed from all grossness
and impurity, and only retaining its beauty, that would be the
place I was in.</p>

<p>I looked at my companions, two girls of about nineteen or
twenty, dressed in straight-dropping, somewhat classic garments,
and both lovely with an unearthly loveliness. I naturally glanced
at myself, and found that I wore a dress of something the same
style. I felt no surprise at this, I for, as I said, the draught
had rendered me as I oblivious of my immediate individual past as
one from the fatted fountain of Nepenthe would have I done.</p>

<p>'What is the name of this land?' I asked.</p>

<p>'It has no name, we who are here wait.'</p>

<p>'Wait for what?' I answered.</p>

<p>'For our time to return,' said the girl who had I spoken
last.</p>

<p>'To return? What did you mean when you were talking to each
other, and said you had escaped the trouble and misery of a life
on earth?'</p>

<p>'We are of the earth the same as you, but we died as infants;
since then we have grown up here.'</p>

<p>'And yet the place has no name?'</p>

<p>'No, it is only the Land of Wait.'</p>

<p>'If you died so young, how is it you know that there are
troubles on earth.'</p>

<p>'We visit it often, but we are not visible. We have stood by
our parents, when they grieved for us, and when fresh brothers
and sisters took our places we have seen how we were gradually
forgotten.'</p>

<p>I strove to remember what had immediately I happened before my
advent to this place, but I could not succeed. I could remember
things generally, but not particularly.</p>

<p>'Can you show me some of this strange land?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Come with us,' the girls replied.</p>

<p>We walked down a winding path that led through groves and
forests, with here and there a swell of meadow land. We met
several people on the way, dressed like I was, but all were
abstracted and silent. Presently there came along the path one
whom I recognised at a glance. The hairless face, stern,
features, and indomitable look, was unmistakable, as was the
squat, square figure. But now no elation was visible in the face,
no remembrance of past glories came to lighten it up. Only the
brooding look I noticed upon all as if they were engaged in an
endless attempt to solve the mystery of their past.</p>

<p>My two companions and other young people had not this
expression, for they had happily no past to remember. The girls
shrank back as the figure I have described drew near, pacing with
bent head and hands locked behind the back. He passed, and my
guides seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

<p>'I cannot bear to meet him,' said one to the other.</p>

<p>'Nor I,' returned her companion.</p>

<p>'He was a great conqueror, was he not?' she said, addressing
me.</p>

<p>'The greatest of our time,' I said. 'Does he, too, wait?'</p>

<p>'This is the Land of Wait,' answered one simply.</p>

<p>'Woe to the world, then, when he returns,' I said. 'He will
find it equipped with weapons of wholesale destruction such as he
never dreamed of. He will make it one reeking field of carnage
from one end to the other, if he goes back with all his former
experience, dormant though forgotten, in his mind.'</p>

<p>We passed on, and suddenly I noticed my guides became more
cheerful and sprightlier in demeanor. Birds were singing, and all
around us seemed blithe and jocund. Wondering at this, I suddenly
noticed a man reclining under a tree, whose face was as familiar
to me as that of the man whom we had lately passed. The noble
brow, benign eyes, and sensitive mouth, were those known to every
man where all European languages are read and spoken. Though his
figure was not clad in the familiar Elizabethan dress, no one
could mistake the man who reposed there, with none of the
brooding look so noticeable in the others in his face. Rather he
seemed as if musing pleasantly over fresh conceits than striving
to recall old memories.</p>

<p>'When he returns?' asked one of my guides artlessly.</p>

<p>'The world will be a hundred times the better for him. He will
carry fresh and undreamt-of joy into the lives of thousands. I
hope I shall be a boy upon earth when his time comes to
return.'</p>

<p>'I always feel different when I am near him,' said one girl,
looking at the reposeful figure with a radiant smile.</p>

<p>'Do none speak to each other in this land of Wait?' I
asked.</p>

<p>'Only such as we are, who have no past to recall. Those who
have lived their lives are always striving to remember them, but
always in vain. No one takes back to earth any memories of his
former life beyond a few fleeting fancies that cannot be grasped.
And it is here they forget them.'</p>

<p>We passed on, and saw many more people whose faces and forms I
recognised, and for whose return earth still waited. The crowds
thickened, and one ponderous person passed me whose face wore a
more than usual puzzled expression; and who muttered continually
to himself something that sounded like 'Fleet-street.'</p>

<p>'Do you know much of this land?' I asked, when once we paused
to sit down and rest.</p>

<p>The girls laughed. 'We who have no memories know all about it;
the rest are too busy trying to remember who they were.'</p>

<p>'I want to see where the savages, wait,' I replied.</p>

<p>'Everywhere; only they prefer the Hills and mountains. Shall
we go there?' We rose and walked towards a not very distant range
of low, mountainous hills; in this land walking was no fatigue.
Arrived there we found many of the savages sitting about in
listless attitude, with much the same look on their faces that
all the others wore. Some had attempted to form weapons, such as
they used in life, but their memory failed them, and the
unfinished implements lay there, never to be completed.</p>

<p>'In what form will they return?' I pondered</p>

<p>'Who can say,' said one of my guides. 'When though here they
wear the aspect of their past life, in the future they maybe as
different as possible. That great conqueror we passed; he lived
in France, did he not?'</p>

<p>'He did.'</p>

<p>'But what country he returns to is in the hands of fate.'</p>

<p>'It would be rather rough on the world if he sprang up in
Russia,' I thought.</p>

<p>We wandered amongst the savages, who had enough lingering left
of their old life to prefer the solitude of the mountains to the
haunts of the whites. There was not so much dejection in their
looks as listlessness, and a vain striving after a lost past.
There seemed little more to see in the mountains, so we descended
again, and wandered back, always in the misty half light, like
the struggling thoughts of the inhabitants, but yet I could see
plainly enough in it.'</p>

<p>'And does time pass always this way, waiting for the recall to
life and earth?</p>

<p>'Always; only for those like us, it is different, for we have
never known another life. We have seen it when we see the living
at times, and what we do see does not make us wish to so
there.'</p>

<p>'You talk of the earth as though it were a region close at
hand. Where is it?'</p>

<p>The girls smiled.</p>

<p>'This is the earth where we are now. These trees, these hills,
and plains, are those of earth; but seen with other eyes, the
eyes of those who wait They cannot see the living, nor can the
living see them; but the living are here all around us, pursuing
their work and daily toil, while we, the few privileged ones,
without any memory of sin and sorrow, can stand beside them
unseen and unfelt, and watch their daily and hourly
struggle.'</p>

<p>'Yes,' said the other, 'and influence them at times. Before
now we have made the intending suicide drop his pistol, the
forger change his mind and tear up the guilty paper, the murderer
forego his purpose. We, the sinless ones, have power in the world
such as he'&mdash;and she pointed to the moody figure of Napoleon
passing at a distance&mdash;'never dreamt of. You are not yet one
of the waiting world; will you look on earth again?'</p>

<p>I said 'Yes,' and immediately the girl had spoken, put her
hands on my eyes and closed them.</p>

<p><br>
'BY gum! He's a gonner!' said the voice of Jack Smith. 'I
thought he looked mighty pinched and queer when I got up from
having a smoke, and I came over to him, and there was the sweat
on his forehead, and yet he was as cold as a tombstone.'</p>

<p>'Feel his heart,' said Tom Green.</p>

<p>A rough hand was thrust under my shirt and held there for a
minute. 'Not a beat.'</p>

<p>'I've heard of holding a looking glass before the mouth,' said
Tom, 'and if it dims the least little bit, why there's breath in
the body.'</p>

<p>'I've got a bit of glass, we'll see,' replied Jack. I heard
all this conversation, and yet could not move or stir. I felt
that it would not be long before I was a fitting candidate for
the land of wait.</p>

<p>Jack approached with the glass and held it before my mouth,
then removed it after a while and they both criticised it
carefully.</p>

<p>'He's gone, poor fellow,' said Tom. 'We'll have to put him
underground to-night&mdash;such weather as this.'</p>

<p>This roused a frightful horror in my breast I had no fear of
the 'land of wait,' but I had an awful horror, as I think, have
all men, of a living burial. I struggled to burst the lethargy
that held me fast; then suddenly, it seemed as though something
soft was brushed against my eyes, and I was once more in the land
of wait, and on either side my two girl guides.</p>

<p>'Well, your friends are going to bury you tonight,' said one
smiling. 'Were you there?'</p>

<p>'We were. We told you we had the power of looking on at the
living, and at times influencing them.'</p>

<p>'Then influence those two men not to bury me alive.'</p>

<p>'That will not happen, for your time for this land of waiting
has not come yet.'</p>

<p>'And when I do come, how shall I know you again, for my memory
will be gone?'</p>

<p>'We wait. Before you come we may have been called back to
earth. If we are here we shall know you; let that suffice.'</p>

<p>'Hark! you are called now!' said the other one.</p>

<p>I looked round on the misty landscape, on the rapidly fading,
beautiful faces of the two girls who had guided me through the
land where the souls await their call back to earth, to work out
their destiny in other bodies; then all was blank.</p>

<p>Once more I was lying, weak and exhausted, in my bunk. It was
night, bright moon light. A short distance away I could hear the
strokes of a pick and the murmur of voices. Tom and Jack were
digging my grave. I essayed to move, and found that I could
feebly stir my limbs. It was enough. With a bit of a struggle I
sat up in my bunk and propped myself against the slabs. Then I
waited for the return of my companions. They took some
time&mdash;evidently they were conscientious over their
work&mdash;then I heard them come back to the hut, talking as
they came.</p>

<p>'It's a pity,' said Jack, as they entered, 'that we couldn't
make a proper coffin; but Lord, poor fellow, he wouldn't object
to a couple of sheets of bark.'</p>

<p>'No, I don't mind,' I managed to get out.</p>

<p>'Goramighty, Samson!' cried Jack, falling back, while Tom said
something like 'Godfrey Daniel Simpson!'</p>

<p>It took some time before I could persuade them that I was
really alive, and that the fever had left me. Then said Jack:</p>

<p>'Strong enough to get on your pins, old man?'</p>

<p>I protested that I was not.</p>

<p>'I'm sorry, because I'd like you to come out and see the
lovely grave we dug for you. Never mind, we'll keep it open
against it's wanted.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>28. &mdash; A LONG ROAD'S END</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 29 Dec 1900</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">THE long road seemed to be never coming to an
end. It would not have mattered so much had there been any change
in the landscape, any break or diversion which would end the
wearisome monotony of straight gum forest and straighter, dusty
track. The traveller began to feel out of temper, and his temper
was usually of the best. When the tired packhorse he was leading
hung back, and did not lead so well as usual, he jerked irritably
at the halter, which was a thing quite unusual for him to do. The
sameness of the timber and the surroundings was getting on his
nerves, and he longed for some sort of a rest and change.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a turn in the road. It was no longer an
everlasting straight track, with the gaunt telegraph poles
running beside it, but a deeply-foliaged creek appeared in view,
and beyond he could see the green vista of a cultivation
paddock.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether this can be Dowall's place?" muttered the
rider. "I thought it was further off; anyway, I'll inquire."</p>

<p>He turned off along the track which lad to the homestead he
was approaching, and let himself into the paddock by a neat,
easy-swinging gate, which to a man accustomed to heavy sliprails
was a luxury indeed. Everything looked smiling and green after
the dusty road, and he noted with complacency the irrigation
canals and the elevated tanks. There was a nice garden around the
house, and a convenient shed wherein to hang his horses up while
he made inquiries.</p>

<p>Those inquiries led him to the verandah, where a young woman
of rather comely presence met him with a smiling Inquiry.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are Mr. Conyers, whom my father expected
to-day? He will be back directly, meantime the boy will attend to
your horses and bring your valise in."</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Conyers followed his guide into the house, and
sat down to some refreshment, which the young lady kindly adapted
to a bachelor taste.</p>

<p>"I am glad I had an opportunity of speaking to you alone
before you met my father," said Miss Dowall. "I know of you as an
old friend of his for whom he has a great regard, and I wish to
tell you that you will find him greatly altered, and I want you
to pretend not to notice it. I cannot account for the alteration,
but it has been noticeable ever since my mother died, four years
ago. I hope you are going to pay a long visit, and perhaps he may
confide in you the cause of the change in his manner. I assure
you it's worrying me."</p>

<p>At this unexpected and frank disclosure Conyers could do
nothing else but express his desire to be of service, and it was
an honest desire, for Dowall and he had been always the best of
friends, although often the width of the Australian continent
apart. But a severance like that often tends to the continuance
of friendship.</p>

<p>Very shortly Dowall returned, and Conyers saw at once that
there was a greater change in his friend than the intervening
years should have made. But Dowall roused himself at sight of his
old friend, and during that evening, at least, was his old
self.</p>

<p>"I thank you," whispered Miss Dowall, as she said good night
to her guest. "He has not been like this for a long time."</p>

<p>Next morning Dowall still seemed his old self, and proposed a
ride to a certain cattle camp, to have his friend's opinion on
some cattle running there. Miss Dowall accompanied them, and, as
the morning was bright and cool, the ride was pleasant in the
extreme.</p>

<p>After Inspecting the cattle, they went on to a creek where a
blackboy had been sent ahead with a packhorse to make a fire, and
Miss Dowall soon had lunch prepared for them. They were in the
middle of the meal, and chatting gaily, when suddenly Dowall
sprang to his feet, and, with a look of horror, appeared to be
listening Intently to some sound. His face was white, and he was
trembling all over.</p>

<p>Miss Dowall rose and went to her father.</p>

<p>"Did you hear anything?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Nothing out of the way, father."</p>

<p>"Not a voice calling out?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"And you, Conyers?"</p>

<p>"I heard no voice."</p>

<p>"It must have been fancy. I am afraid I am troubled with
delusions, and want a change."</p>

<p>The meal was renewed, but all the gaiety was gone. Conyers
pondered long on the matter. That Dowall was troubled with
delusions was evident enough, and lie felt sorry for his
daughter, in whom he was beginning to take a great interest, and
if he could succeed in solving the mystery of her father's
strange illness the interest might become mutual, he began to
watch Dowall carefully, but quietly. There was no doubt that the
man was haunted, and there was equally little doubt that
otherwise he was as good a business man as ever, and as good a
station manager. But what was the meaning of this strange illness
that had overtaken him?</p>

<p>Conyers's visit became extended Indefinitely, he was an idle
man of means, although energetic enough on occasions. Lucy
Dowall's grey eyes had, however, done their work, and he felt he
could not leave without a favorable answer to his suit. His
answer, when he asked the question, was favorable enough, but
Lucy told him plainly that it was impossible for her to leave her
father while he continued in the peculiar state he was. "Left
alone," she urged, and her lover could not deny it, "he will
become so morose and melancholy that I dread the worst."</p>

<p>"Why does he not go away for a year?"</p>

<p>"He obstinately refuses. He has a nervous horror of being
amongst strangers."</p>

<p>When Conyers spoke to Dowall about the feeling he had for Lucy
the latter looked troubled.</p>

<p>"I don't say that the idea is unfamiliar to me, and it has my
warm approval; but you cannot marry Lucy until you have heard the
whole of my wretched story. I do not feel capable of telling you
to-day. Give me until to-morrow."</p>

<p>Conyers urged him to tell him everything when the time came,
as he thought he might be able to help him, and with this they
parted. The mystery seemed to be growing deeper instead of
clearer. What possible reason was there he should not marry Lucy,
save one? Had Dowall, afflicted with his strange disease,
persuaded himself that there was hereditary madness in his
system?</p>

<p>Conyers felt that he had hit upon the secret. He was assured
that Dowall was no more mad than he was, and could one dispel the
fancy that he was brooding over he would be himself again. Was it
the death of his wife, to whom he was much attached, that had
produced this state of mind? Lucy said It commenced about that
period. He told Lucy what had passed between him and her father,
and spoke hopefully in the matter, and seemed to anticipate that
the statement would lead to explanations which would clear up
things in a happy manner. He asked Lucy if she had any particular
reason for attributing his changed manner to the death of her
mother, and she answered that she had a peculiar feeling about
the matter that she could not account for. Much as her father and
mother had loved each other, she did not think that excessive
grief on her mother's account would in any way unhinge her
father's mind. He was of too practical a nature.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see him as he was the other day at the camp?"
asked Conyers. "I have seen him start and listen with a terrified
air, but he never asked me If I heard any thing, or heard anybody
speak as he did that day."</p>

<p>"And these starts and listenings commenced from the day of
your mother's death?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly from the day of her death, but from a few days
after she was buried. And I have more to tell you. More that is
still stranger. I have heard talking in his room often. At first
I felt frightened, and one night I summoned up courage to knock
at the door of his room.</p>

<p>"'Who Is with you, father?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No one,' he answered.</p>

<p>"'Who were you talking to, then?' I asked.</p>

<p>"'No one; I must have been talking in my sleep. Don't take
any notice. I am rather restless. He was not talking in his
sleep, for there were two distinct voices. Since then I have
heard them often."</p>

<p>Conyers felt that no satisfactory explanation could be given
to this, and it was with some anxiety he awaited the disclosure
Dowall had promised to make.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">'CONYERS,' said Musgrave, when the time came for
him to make his promised disclosure. 'Mine is about the strangest
tale you ever heard. I deserve all I'm suffering, for I am a
murderer. A murderer do I say? Far worse. I murdered my own
son.'</p>

<p>'Your own son,' said Conyers in' surprise. 'I did not know you
had a son?'</p>

<p>'He was not a white boy, he was a half-caste; you understand,
of course, it was before my marriage. I expected that when I
married, his mother might make trouble, so to make sure I told
her everything.'</p>

<p>'The best way, too,' muttered Conyers.</p>

<p>'Mother and child hung about the station, and I could not well
turn them away, but the mother, strange to say, appeared to have
a great admiration of my wife, and would do anything for her, but
the son would not approach her, of which I was glad, for he grew
up a sullen, ill-conditioned reprobate. For conscience sake I had
him educated, and I wish to goodness I had not. To that I owe my
trouble. He should have grown up in the blacks' camp by right. He
worked on the station, and as he grew up I could see that he
resented his inferior position. That you see was the result of
educating a nature not fitted to receive it. Well, time went on,
and Lucy came back from school, and then his evil temper broke
out.</p>

<p>'One day we were out on the run together alone.</p>

<p>'How would you like (he spoke perfectly good English) me to
tell Miss Lucy that I am her half-brother?'</p>

<p>'I'd cut the soul out of you if you did, and you know it.'</p>

<p>'Cut my soul out, you, my father, eh? Just try it?'</p>

<p>'I did try it, and gave him it with the stockwhip pretty hot, for
I was mad at the thought of what he had said. 'Now I will do it,' he
said. Then I pulled him off his horse, and went at him with my fists.
I am a powerful man, and can use them as you know. I punched him about
the body, and I suppose struck him hard over the heart, for he fell
down dead.'</p>

<p>'Are you sure he was dead?'</p>

<p>'Sure! Do I know a dead man from a live one or not? Some
blacks were about, and they took the body away, and I heard no
more about it, but the mother disappeared from the station. Soon
after that my dear wife died, and then it was that my torture
commenced. I hear his voice, he comes to my room and talks to me,
I am haunted day and night. But I deserve it. Now I see you think
that it is a good deal of fancy on my part, but when I heard the
voice at the creek the other day, did you or Lucy hear it?'</p>

<p>'That's easily accounted for. There was plenty of cover, and
anyone could easily have crept up unseen, and said anything
without our hearing it. We were a little bit engrossed
perhaps.'</p>

<p>'The man was dead I tell you, and it would not answer anybody
else's purpose to torment me so.'</p>

<p>'Where's the mother?'</p>

<p>'She came back to the station after my wife died.'</p>

<p>'Will you let me change places with you tonight, after dark,
unobserved?'</p>

<p>'I see what you mean, but you will hear nothing.'</p>

<p><br>
THAT night Conyers lay wakeful and watching, for he was
convinced that Musgrave was the subject of a trick. He was not
disappointed. When the house was quiet, a dark figure appeared in
the dim light, and commenced to say something, but Conyers,
determined not to risk an exposure, sprang out of bed and
grappled with the intruder, shouting for Musgrave to bring a
light.</p>

<p>The man whom Conyers had collared fought hard to get away, but
he stuck to him until Musgrave appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>'Here's your ghost, Musgrave.'</p>

<p>'Good Heavens, and I have been frightened nearly into madness
by this man!'</p>

<p>'What shall we do with him?'</p>

<p>'You let me go,' said the captive sullenly. 'You don't know
who I am.'</p>

<p>'I believe I do better than Mr. Musgrave does. It's not the
only part you've been acting. Now, we'll just lock him up until
daylight.'</p>

<p>They did so, and then Conyers, after Musgrave had quieted
Lucy's fears, communicated his suspicions to him.</p>

<p>'Is this the man you thought you killed, and who called
himself your son?'</p>

<p>'It is.'</p>

<p>'Well, I don't believe that he is your son. He's bullied his
mother into telling you so, and you've believed her. Come look at
the facts as you have told them to me.'</p>

<p>'By jove, you are right, I believe, and I have been made a
fool of all along,' and in spite of having been made a fool of,
Musgrave's face cleared with joy.</p>

<p>When daylight came Conyers took the affair in hand and found
all his suspicions confirmed by the mother's confession.</p>

<p>So the long road came to an end.</p>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>29. &mdash; THE MISTAKE OF A LIFE</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 16 Oct 1897</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">MORNING, such as only Southern Queensland, in
all the world, can boast of&mdash;a morning when spring is not
too far advanced and the flowering shrubs of the sub-tropical
clime are sweet and fresh, and the cool air of awakening day is
heavy with fragrance, a fragrance that vanishes when the sun
asserts his might as lord of the day. But whilst his power is in
abeyance, whilst the dew is moist on the grass and the first man
to cross leaves a dark trail of crushed blades and the trees drip
big tears, then, to the early riser, such a morning is a vision
to be treasured and remembered.</p>

<p>On such a balmy, peaceful dawn one remembers other breaking
morns&mdash;morns of still, sultry heat, when night had brought
neither respite nor repose, and one rose bitterly to gaze around
upon a dead, dust-white plain; or upon an oily sea, restless with
a long dreary roll, making every spar creak and groan like a
repining spirit; or the streets of a city, saddest sight of all,
with the paling gas and electric lights, the shabby, skulking
figures fleeing from the light of day, and all the nocturnal
wastrels of so-called civilisation biding from the coming life
and bustle. Better than this last is a morning in the central
desert, with the sign of a blood-red sun blazing in the east; or
a windless dawn in Torres Strait, with the New Guinea coast
looming in the distance. But here it was as clean an out-cut from
the pitiful stains of humanity as ever was the fabled daybreak of
the golden age.</p>

<p>Out on the verandah of the picturesque old homestead stepped
one who 'might have lived in the golden age. A girl of 19, tall
and lithe in figure, with a flush of expectancy on her
face&mdash;a flush on her face and a sparkle in her eyes that
came from the golden age of love. She leaned on the bar
surrounding the verandah, plucked a rose from the clusters
climbing on the verandah, and listened eagerly. Far distant
echoed the ring of a horse's hoofs, cantering along the road. The
girl put the rose to her lips and wafted a kiss in the direction.
At times the noise of horse tread died away when the rider was
crossing some hollow or gully; then they would come again louder
and clearer than before. At last they approached quite close, the
rider being hidden by a patch of scrub round which the road
wound; by the sound the house was pulled up to a walk, and the
horseman soon appeared, the rays of the early sun glinting behind
him.</p>

<p>The waiting girl turned pale, and then flushed red again, a
look of keen disappointment in her eyes. The newcomer, though as
goodly a specimen of manhood as maiden could desire for a lover,
was evidently not the right man who had been expected.</p>

<p>The rider lifted his hat to her, dismounted, hitched his horse
on a rail, and walked up to the verandah.</p>

<p>'Good morning, Miss Grandon. Is your father up yet?'</p>

<p>'Where's Herbert?' said the girl quickly, evidently thinking
of but one thing. 'I thought he was coming down with you.'</p>

<p>'So he did as far as Branxmore, and he managed to miss the
train there and of course the steamer at Rockhampton as
well.'</p>

<p>'He'll be down on the next boat men. But there's nothing the
matter with him? You're not deceiving me?'</p>

<p>'Not at all; he was as well as I am, the last time I saw him,
and I've heard nothing to the contrary since.'</p>

<p>The appearance of another man just then interrupted the
conversation. Grandon, the father of the girl who had been
waiting and watching on the verandah, was a tall thin man, with a
good-tempered looking face, somewhat weather-beaten and
sunburned. He had evidently risen hastily on hearing the voices'
outside.</p>

<p>'Well, Lascelles,' he said, 'back from the west. What have you
done with Wilford?'</p>

<p>'I was just telling Miss Grandon that he missed the train at
Branxmore, so he didn't come down with me. I got home last night,
and rode over the first thing this morning to tell you.'</p>

<p>The girl turned away for a minute, probably to hide the
mortification in her face, and Lascelles seized the opportunity
of making a sign to Grandon that he wanted to speak to him alone.
The elder man stepped down from the verandah, and the two
sauntered away out of earshot.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' asked Grandon, uneasily.</p>

<p>'Bad enough. When Wilford and I got to Branxmore the town was
full; there was a show and race meeting on. Wilford met a lot of
old friends and got on the spree.'</p>

<p>'A last bachelor one, eh? Well, I don't suppose Nora will ever
hear of it,' said Grandon easily. 'Hang it, man, do you think
that I came over here at this time in the morning to tell tales
about Wilford. No. There was a woman in one of the bars, who was
setting them all by the ears. I need not describe her; you can
imagine the sort of woman who goes back west as a barmaid. Well,
Wilford got entangled with her, and was not properly sober for
days. I could do nothing with him, though I did my best, nor
bring him to reason at all.'</p>

<p>'A pretty disgraceful sort of thing, considering his
approaching marriage to Nora, but I think, Lascelles, I would
have held my tongue about it, if I had been you,' said Grandon,
in an offended and suspicions tone, for it struck him that it
looked very like blackening the character of an absent man.
Lascelles stamped his foot angrily, and his face flushed at the
other's words.</p>

<p>'Can't you understand what I mean,' he retorted, hotly. 'I
came over here the first thing in order that you can tell your
daughter, and not let her hear of it by accident. He married the
woman. That's why he did not come down with me.'</p>

<p>Across Grandon's face shot a mingled look of rage and
pain.</p>

<p>'The infernal scoundrel!' he said. 'Why it will kill Nora. Her
belief in the man is perfect.'</p>

<p>'No, it won't kill her. She has too much pride for that. Wilford
has killed himself effectually as far as his future is concerned;
but Miss Grandon will get over it. He never can.'</p>

<p>'Was he drunk when he did it?'</p>

<p>'He certainly was not sober, nor in his right senses; but he
is married right enough.'</p>

<p>'Surely he will never come back here.'</p>

<p>'That's what I am afraid, of. The baggage he has married is a
woman with character, and she will have her way with him. When he
comes to himself he will recognise how hopeless his lot is, and
either blow his brains out&mdash;the best thing he could
do&mdash;or start drinking and let everything go to the
devil.'</p>

<p>'It's an awful blow,' said Grandon; 'but Nora is a brave girl,
though, it's at a time like this. I feel the loss of my
wife.'</p>

<p>'No one could wish Wilford a worse punishment than what he has
provided for himself,' said Lascelles. 'Now I must be off
back.'</p>

<p>'You won't stay to breakfast?'</p>

<p>'Under the circumstances, no, old man.' So the messenger of
bad tidings rode away.</p>

<p>'She will always think of me in connection with this, and
dislike me accordingly,' he thought gloomily as he went home.</p>

<p>'What's that mysterious confab been about,' asked Nora
Grandon, as her father returned to the verandah.</p>

<p>'Bad news, child,' he replied.</p>

<p>'Bad news? About Herbert? Then Mr. Lascelles did not tell me
the truth after all. He is ill, or has met with an accident.'</p>

<p>'Neither one nor the other; he has simply acted like a fool
and villain.'</p>

<p>The girl's face flushed hotly.</p>

<p>'What has Lascelles dared to tell you?' she said.</p>

<p>'Lascelles told me the truth. Wilford goes out of your life
for ever. He is now the husband of another woman.'</p>

<p>Her father had to hastily spring forward and catch his
daughter in his arms, she turned so white and staggered. She did
not faint, however, but after a moment or two stood upright
again.'</p>

<p>It cannot be true,' she wailed.</p>

<p>'It must be true. Lascelles would not invent such a story,
that must be well known up there. It happened at Branxmore, and
the only way to account for it is that Wilford was not
responsible for his actions when he did it.'</p>

<p>'He was drunk?' queried the white-faced girl.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered her father.</p>

<p>'And he swore to me when he left that he would never be
induced to touch anything again. He broke that oath, why should
he keep his faith with me,' then?'</p>

<p>Nora Grandon leaned against the side of the doorway, and gazed
out on the fair landscape that had suddenly become dull and
dreary to her.</p>

<p>'Who is the woman be married? She cannot be a good one to
marry a drunken man.'</p>

<p>'She is not,' replied her father. 'But you need not speak of
her, enough to know that she will be his shame and ruin, for the
rest of his life.'</p>

<p>'Do you think that will be any satisfaction to me?' said Nora,
indignantly, then turned to hide her misery in her own room.</p>

<p>Her father drew a deep breath of relief. 'She'll get over it,'
he mused, 'and it's better as it is. Wilford would never have got
out of the clutches of drink&mdash;it's in his blood. Now, it she
will only notice Lascelles, she will, have a man for her
husband.'</p>

<p>He turned to see after some of the early work going on on the
homestead; whilst on her bed in the solitude of her room his
daughter was sobbing her heart out.</p>

<p>And Lascelles was riding homeward, sorrowing for the girl he
had long loved with an unrequited passion; but his heart full of
a new hope that he could not repress.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">OUT on the limitless plains of the far west,
where only a winding, twisting creek, sparsely timbered, broke
the view, a man was standing, or, rather, leaning, against one of
the verandah posts of a rude hut built of stones and mud, and
thatched with coarse grass. He was smoking and evidently lost in
a brown study. Dressed only in the rough garb of outside
settlement, Lascelles did not look the well-dressed,
neatly-groomed man who brought Miss Grandon the tidings of her
lover's perjury nearly twelve months before. Those twelve months
had not brought him any nearer to Nora. Outwardly the girl had
quickly mastered her grief, and turned a brave face to the world;
but in her heart the cruel shame that had been put upon her still
bled and rankled. Lascelles had brought his cattle out, and
stocked the country that he had taken up on his former visit.</p>

<p>Of Wilford he saw but little, although the country he had
secured and stocked was in Lascelles's immediate neighborhood.
When Wilford's dazed senses returned to him, and he saw before
him the whole horror of his future life, he resolved to bury
himself in the far west.</p>

<p>Naturally, this did not suit his new-made wife. Aware that he
possessed a small but valuable station in the closely-settled
coast district, with a comfortable homestead, she had not the
slightest intention of going to live in the inferno of a
newly-formed station beyond the bounds of nowhere. But rage and
blaspheme as she would, the man was firm.</p>

<p>Return to the place where he had lived so long with this
painted harridan, ten years older than himself, as his bride, he
would not shame himself that far. At last she consented, after
wringing various concessions from him; and when a house was ready
Wilford went out to perpetual exile, taking with him his lifelong
punishment, who only consented to come on condition that she was
allowed a long visit to Melbourne in a year's time.</p>

<p>And so they settled down on the new station, amid the great
silent plains, the romance and mystery of which the woman could
not understand. Only when the supply of rum and other liquor came
up with the teams did she appreciate life. In off times she gave
Wilford no rest until he cent packhorses to the nearest shanty to
obtain a supply of the vile compound called rum in the parlance
of the bush publican of the for outside.</p>

<p>Lascelles, riding over occasionally, thought hard things of
Wilford&mdash;thought that he had brought his wife out to that
lone spot to let her drink herself to death or insanity, and free
him from the hideous incubus.</p>

<p>But he was mistaken. With all his weakness, Wilford had
accepted his fate, and had no thought of hastening the end that
he saw looming before the one or the other of them, for he drank
heavily himself, and Lascelles heard of the orgies on the
station; and discontinued his visits, as being of no use, and
only tending to do harm. Therefore, he was much surprised to see,
as he lounged against the verandah post, a rider coming across
the plain, whom he immediately recognised as Wilford.</p>

<p>'It's all over, old man.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' demanded the man, slowly taking his pipe
from his mouth.</p>

<p>'My wife is dead. Come over with me and fix things up.'</p>

<p><br>
LASCELLES started, and examined the face of the man keenly, a
suspicion striking him that perhaps Wilford himself had done the
deed.</p>

<p>'I was away out mustering, and there was no one on the place
but the Chinese cook; but I had no suspicion of any myalls being
in the neighborhood.' answered Wilford, as much in reply to the
glance as to any spoken word of inquiry.</p>

<p>'I left the men and rode in this afternoon, and found her
dead, the cook gone, and the tracks of blacks about the place.
Will you come back, and do what you can, as the men will not
return until to-morrow?'</p>

<p>'Of course, I will, and take a man with me.'</p>

<p>It was a good moon, and the three did not take long to cover
the distance between the two places. Wilford had taken the body
of his wife into the house, and laid it on the bed. The
unfortunate woman had seemingly been killed at one blow, and was
not much disfigured. Search as they would, they could not find
the body of the Chinaman, and concluded that he had either fled
or his body been carried off.</p>

<p>The blacks had done no damage to the place, and appeared to
have been but a small travelling party, as there were no tracks
of gins or children amongst, them.</p>

<p>Lascelles was a J.P., and therefore able to make an official
report on the matter without having to send for the police.</p>

<p>At the sultry dawn of a day of windless heat they buried, the
body of the unfortunate creature who had wrought such ruin in
Wilford's life. Then Lascelles turned his horse's head homeward,
and pondered on what would be the upshot of it all.</p>

<p>Would Nora Grandon condone the terrible offence and take her
recreant lover back. He thought and hoped not, but who can answer
for the wayward will of a woman where her heart is concerned.</p>

<p><br>
WILFORD remained on the station for some months, and then
Lascelles saw him. Next he noticed the change for the better in
his appearance. Although aged for his years he was a man from
whom a weight of shame and terror, bad been lifted. Has he still
hopes, thought Lascelles, jealously.</p>

<p>At that time there was a slight boom in western property in
Queensland, and Wilford sold his place and returned east to his
old station on the coast which he had leased during his terms of
exile out west.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Lascelles received an offer too favorable
to decline, and he too bade farewell to the western plains and
their tragedies.</p>

<p>On returning to the district where he had formerly resided he
heard that. Wilford was living a quiet, steady life on his
station. Nora Crandon still lived with her father, and looked as
though the storm of her life had cleared without leaving much
trace.</p>

<p>Lascelles thought that the time had arrived for him to try his
fate, and in consequence his horse's feet often took the road to
Grandon's station. But it proved vain. The girl gave him her
friendship, but nothing more, and he had perforce to content
himself with that, and so things went on until he heard that
Wilford, who, naturally, shunned the Grandons at first, was again
to be found at the station on friendly terms.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">NORA forgave her lover. He had been striving to
atone for the past, and he had succeeded. Grandon himself was not
in favor of it, but he was too easy-going where his daughter was
concerned to make any active opposition, so long as be saw her
going about with a happy smiling face once more.</p>

<p>Lascelles tried hard to stifle the life-long love he had for
the girl and seek consolation elsewhere, but he could not do it,
and made preparations to leave his place for a while when the
time for the wedding drew near. But he never went.</p>

<p>One morning early a messenger arrived from Wilford's station
with a packet for him, and when Lascelles had read it he took
horse at once and rode over. But he was too late, as he
anticipated. Wilford had ended his mistaken life by his own hand.
The packet was a pitiful confession of crime, and at the last he
dared not face the ordeal of marrying the pure-hearted girl who
had loved him so long and truly.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
'When I returned early to the station ahead of the men,'
[it ran], 'I missed my wife from the house, and after
calling her in vain went to the kitchen to ask the cook if she
had gone out riding. What did I see? Lying on the Chinaman's
filthy bunk was the woman I had married&mdash;stupefied with
opium. The grinning wretch himself was in a half-dazed condition
from the same drug.</p>

<p class="letter">
'My brain gave way and I lost control of myself, and only
felt the lust of revenge and murder hot within me. I killed them
both.</p>

<p class="letter">
'Then arose before me the possibility of a new; life of
freedom and a return to myself again. A small party of natives
had been to the station, but had done no harm, and their tracks
would serve to hide my deed.</p>

<p class="letter">
'The Chinaman's body I took away and concealed. My wife I carried
it in and laid on the bed. You know all the rest. I had made up
my mind to face life once more, and partly succeeded; but the
strain has been too much. I have succumbed.</p>

<p class="letter">
'For nights that woman has come in my dreams and told me of
what was coming, and I cannot let Nora marry a haunted murderer.</p>

<p class="letter">
'She will get over it, and I trust to you to hide the real
facts of my crime and let her imagine that it was a bit of
temporary insanity that has led to this deed; insanity bred by
brooding over the wretched past when I lost her, as I now know,
for ever. This is the charge of a dying; man to a one-time
friend, and, for Nora's sake I feel that you will carry it out;
but I felt that you, of all men, were entitled to know the truth
of the tragedy out west.'</p>

ONCE more an act of painful necessity was laid on Lascelles.
Once more it was his duty to cross the path of her he loved with
tidings of woe and trouble. And he did it bravely as before. The
unfortunate suicide and murderer has long since mouldered into
dust. But Lascelles and Nora Grandon have never become more than;
friends, and now it seems that they never will.</p>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>30. &mdash; GLUGSON'S BEND SANATORIUM</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 29 May 1897</h3>

<p class="first">IT was an awful sell when everything was going
on so swimmingly, but it is always a woman who upsets my
apple-cart, and, for the matter of that, nearly every other
man's. It was a small township or village, not far from the mouth
of the Murray, between Murray Bridge and the mouth of the river.
Railways went all round it, but none of them considered it of
sufficient, importance to call at; in fact, it was only a bit of
a place where a steamer used to tie up now and again.</p>

<p>What the population was when I first went there I can't
say&mdash;I daresay over a hundred; but the wonderful thing that
struck me was the astonishing healthiness of the place.
Grandfathers were as common as the ordinary fathers in other
places&mdash;that is to say, as common as the limited number of
the population admitted. And then they never died; there was no
graveyard belonging to the village. When a man arrived at the
state of a grandfather and began to get a bit shaky about the
knees, he generally got a little too much 'tanked' one night, and
managed to slip over the bank of the river. It was mighty
convenient, no fuss, no funeral&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>The women were the only trouble, for the grandmothers would
generally die shortly after the grandfather had vanished, out of
loneliness, then they just carried her off and planted her
anywhere. How the people lived, goodness knows, but they did not
seem to be badly off, and were able to keep one pub in a state of
solvency. They grew potatoes, and did a bit of trade with the
steamers; caught fish, and took them up to Murray Bridge and down
to Goolwa; shot ducks, cut firewood, and jobs of that sort. But
they were a lazy lot, and thundering gamblers. Most of their time
was spent in playing euchre, which was the only game they knew.
There was not much circulating wealth in the place, but it was
generally in the hands of one or two, and the remainder were
paupers until it came round to their turn to win.</p>

<p>Well, no good entering into the causes that first took me
there, but the confounded healthiness of the place struck me. Of
course, like all speculative men, I naturally thought there must
be money to be made out of it, and my thoughts, like everybody's
would have done, jumped to a sanatorium. That was the first idea,
and when I got, down thinking about it, I saw that it was a
regular soft thing. In the first place there was no graveyard,
and one had never been a long felt want. All deaths were
accidental; no doctor could make a living there. These were the
moral advantages, so to speak. Physically, there was the
river&mdash;trips down to Lake Alexandrina, etc.; we could rig up
a marked tree that Sturt had inscribed, that meant historical
interest; level country for driving and biking&mdash;why, it was
destined by nature for the purpose.</p>

<p>I proceeded to make inquiries, cautiously and methodically,
and found it was even better than I could have anticipated. There
were only two or three people in the place who had bought land,
they would willingly sell out, and the rest could be had straight
from Government.</p>

<p>I started off for Adelaide to see men who had the money to go
into the thing. When the men I had in view heard my account of
the place they bit at once, for they knew I had my wits about me,
and we set to work to draft out the prospectus of the Murray
River Immortality Company. We called it the town of Jouvence, and
drew up tables of 'average ages,' comparing the population of
Jouvence with the populations of places of the same size in New
Guinea and the West Australian gold fields, etc.</p>

<p>Then we had 'Births and Deaths,' 'Conjugal Condition of the
People,' 'Proportion of Married and Unmarried,' 'Sickness and
Infirmity,' (which was shown as nil), and lastly 'Salubrity of
the Climate.' All those tables out of a slushy village of a
little over a hundred inhabitants. I tell you it was a piece of
high art.</p>

<p>It was agreed that I should go back to Glugson's Bend, for
that was how the place was gazetted, and commence making some
improvements. Meantime, the other promoters would secure the land
and push the matter in town which, as it happened to be a
brisk time in speculation, they anticipated would boom. The
promoting money was put up, and I went back to Glugson's Bend and
commenced to make improvements, just to give the place a kind of
air as though big things were going to follow.</p>

<p>Now, we made one great mistake. We ought to have let the
Glugson's Bend people into a slice of a good thing, but, instead
of that, we had bought up the land they owned at a low figure;
were going to secure the rest of it; treated them like a lot of
chumps, in fact, which no doubt they were, but a chump gets very
mad if he misses a bit of pudding.</p>

<p>Anyhow, when they woke up to the fact that Glugson's Bend was
going to blossom out into a mighty big place (so we said), and
that they had not a hand in it, they began to get vicious. I came
in for all the abuse, being on the spot; but I didn't mind that,
for I got news every mail that the thing was catching on like
wild fire, and there were several fortunes sticking out ahead. I
got a decent sort of a landing stage rigged up, and a road cut up
to the one pub.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the publican remained my friend, for he saw
plenty of custom ahead. One or two strange steamers used to tie
up for an hour or two and have a yarn, out of
curiosity&mdash;Murray River steamers are never in a
hurry&mdash;and so we began to be talked about, which was just
what we wanted. The Glugson Bendites went on growling; said my
logs spoiled the river bank, and when two grandfathers tumbled in
and were pulled out again by my workmen, instead of being allowed
to drift down stream, they got real mad, and vowed that I had
shoved them in.</p>

<p>One mail I received a letter from my fellow promoters to say
that a very rich maiden lady, Miss Gojamma, had taken great
interest in the institution of the sanatorium, and intended to
pay it a visit, and, if satisfied as to the soundness of the
speculation, she would buy largely when the affair was put on the
market. Would I see that she was made comfortable?</p>

<p>I wrote back saying that I would do my best as far as the
limitations of the place allowed, and awaited Miss Gojamma with a
calm and assured spirit.</p>

<p>The steamer arrived, and I went on board to meet the lady. To
my astonishment, she was not, as I expected, an old maid, but a
fine, buxom woman of about 28 or 30. She had with her an elderly
man, sickly and feeble, a servant, and a pug dog. The old man was
her uncle, who thought that he would at once try the effects of
the Jouvence air. I got them ashore, though I was afraid once or
twice that the uncle would find the fate of the grandfathers, and
led them up to the hotel, amidst a grinning crowd of Glugson's
Benders, who made audible chuckleheaded remarks as we passed.</p>

<p>I installed them as comfortably as I could, assuring Mr.
Belotson, the uncle, that even with the rough accommodation he
would have to put up with, the wonderful air of Jouvence would
soon restore him to energy and vigor.</p>

<p>Miss Gojamma proved a most amiable companion during her stay
at Jouvence. I took her all over the place, and pointed out all
the facilities for making it the sanatorium of Australasia, and
she entered into everything with great sympathy, and proposed one
or two little things herself&mdash;ideas which, of course, I
received with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, old Belotson sat on a log and coughed, and chatted
with the grandfathers, and grew healthier and stronger day by
day. I had better by far have devoted myself to him than gone
trailing about with Miss Gojamma and whistling up her wheezy pug
dog.</p>

<p>So more than a week passed. I received a letter from my
partners saying that all was ready, and that as soon as they got
the deeds from the Government (we had applied for it as an
agricultural area) the Murray River Immortality Company would be
launched on the market. I showed this to Miss Gojamma, and she
expressed her delight and satisfaction. So did I when we reached
home by kicking that confounded pug when she had gone inside. I
always hated that dog. It was an unfortunate kick, all the
same.</p>

<p>Somehow, a much better feeling had been shown lately in the
town. The Benders chatted amicably with my workmen, and even
bestowed a more genial good morning on me when we met. Naturally,
I spent a little promoting money in setting up a few drinks for
them, and things smiled again. As I passed the half-open door of
the sitting-room, sacred to Miss Gojamma and Uncle Belotson, I
heard the latter reading aloud, and saw him sitting with what
was evidently a blue official paper in his hand.</p>

<p>I just caught the words as follows:</p>

<p>'Name, Glugson's Bend. Hundred, of Crowbait. County of
Gumsucker. Set apart prior to act (18 of 1872), requiring
dedication. There it is, Matilda, and those are the old survey
pegs I saw.'</p>

<p>I didn't wait to hear Matilda's answer, for fear of being
caught listening, but I slipped on to my room, and sat down to
think. But I could make nothing of it, and after tea I strolled,
out in the moonlight and took a short walk on the bank of I the
river. Miss Gojamma's pug walked after me, I and, remembering
that kick, gave me a nip in the leg. Next moment I had whirled
him out into I the flowing stream to join the grandfathers. It
was an act of irritable passion, but I was much I worried at the
time.</p>

<p>There was ruction that night, and the Benders I sought that
pug everywhere; but I trusted that by that time he was safely in
Lake Alexandrina.</p>

<p>Next morning I dispatched a letter to my partners, mentioning
what I had overheard; but my letter crossed one of theirs, in
which occurred the following query:</p>

<p>'Is the old uncle you mention as being with Miss Gojamma a
tall, thin man of the name of Belotson? If so he is the senior I
partner in the firm of Gojamma and Bunkum, the lawyers. He
manages all Miss Gojamma's business (her late father was the head
of the firm), and is the most infernal old skinflint going. He
was not sick at all when he left here, and must have been
shamming, so as to be able to poke about by himself and find
things out. Keep in with them, whatever you do.'</p>

<p>I wrote back at once that it was Belotson, the snaky old
fraud, and that I would do my best to keep friends with him. Back
came the answer to my first letter. It was all up unless we could
compromise and take Belotson and Miss Gojamma into the show. The
land had been withdrawn for township purposes long ago, and old
Belotson had found it out from some of the grandfather Benders,
confirmed it by the register, and notified the Government that it
was the same land we were applying for, and, of course, they
refused our application for an agricultural area, it being
already town lands. Still, there was a strong hope of getting
everything straight if Belotson thought well of the sanatorium
scheme, for we could then go in together, the difference being
that Miss Gojamma and her uncle would stand in as first robbers,
instead of coming in with the crowd. Otherwise&mdash;well, we
neither of us would do any good, for we could mutually spoil each
other's business.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this mattered far more to us than Gojamma and
Company. They had money, and we had none. How I felt inclined to
kick myself for my oversight in not conciliating the Benders! I
should then have heard of the old township reserve, and made
things right. There was no good crying over spilt milk, or
keeping up the farce any longer, and I knocked at the
sitting-room door, and entered into a conference with Belotson
and Miss Gojamma.</p>

<p>They both recognised the situation, and, the ice being broken,
both, especially Miss Gojamma, seemed inclined to enter into
friendly relations. Belotson, as a shrewd man of business,
approved of the scheme throughout, and submitted a plan of
co-operation, which I felt sure my fellow promoters would accept.
It would have been much stiffer, I am sure, but for Miss
Gojamma's influence, and as she was finding most of the money, of
course, she had a good deal to say in the matter.</p>

<p>Things had progressed in a very satisfactory manner, and I
rose to transmit the offer to my partners, feeling that a very
tight place had been well tided over. As I was going, the
landlord came to the door and said, addressing Miss Gojamma:</p>

<p>'Your dorg's found, mum.'</p>

<p>'Oh!' said Miss Gojamma, starting up, 'I am delighted. Poor,
dear old fellow! Where is he?'</p>

<p>I stood, my heart in my mouth, white the man answered
sheepishly:</p>

<p>'Well, he's outside, mum. He ain't eggsackly fit to come in.'
Miss Gojamma pressed to the door, taking me in her train. There
were numerous Benders grouped outside regarding an object on the
ground.</p>

<p>Such an object! A drowned dog is by no means a handsome sight,
but when it is a fat pug, swollen twice its size, with its four
stumpy legs sticking out like the legs of an iron pot&mdash;O,
horror!</p>

<p>Miss Gojamma shrieked, although not one of the shrieking sort,
and leant against me for support.</p>

<p>'How ever did he get into the river?' she moaned. 'My poor St.
John!'&mdash;for that was the pug's name.</p>

<p>'I may as well tell you, mum; Mr. Sawkins there just hove him
in!'</p>

<p>'Yes,' chorused the rest; 'we watched him do it.'</p>

<p>Now this was an awful and shameless conspiracy. One might have
seen me, but I am certain no more did. Miss Gojamma drew herself
away from me with horror.</p>

<p>'You threw my dog in the river!' she exclaimed. I ought to
have denied it boldly, sworn the Benders were all liars together,
and charged them with it; tout I was taken aback too suddenly. I
muttered feebly something about giving him a swim.</p>

<p>'Gave him a swim? Mr. Sawkins, I will never speak to you
again;' and she swept inside to her uncle.</p>

<p>They wrangled all the afternoon. The old man did not care if I
had drowned twenty pugs, when there was a good speculation in
view; but she would have none of it.</p>

<p>In the end he had to give in, and negotiations were off, never
to be restored again. Neither side could profit by the idea, so
it was abandoned.</p>

<p>But I chuckled next year when I heard that an epidemic of
swamp fever had located itself in Glugson's Bend, and many cases
had terminated fatally.</p>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>31. &mdash; THE LAST OF OLD RAT</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 24 Sep 1898</h3>

<p class="first">'THERE'S an old hut about fifteen from here, and
you will strike it about rundown,' said the traveller I had just
met. 'There's good feed and water there; but many people don't
like camping there.'</p>

<p>'Why?'</p>

<p>'I can't say. Never camped there myself. But used to be part
of a pub that was there. That got burned down. That's all I know
about it.'</p>

<p>He had asked for some tobacco, and was filling his pipe as he
spoke; so I continued the conversation&mdash;</p>

<p>'Likely to be haunted, this place?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Tell you I don't know. Knew the pub before it got burnt down.
Had many a good booze there. Ratkins used to keep it. Made rare
good stuff, too. Guaranteed to make a crocodile drunk with five
nips!'</p>

<p>'How did he get burnt down?'</p>

<p>'How do pubs, usually get burnt down? Somebody was boozed, I
suppose, and did it. I wasn't there.'</p>

<p>'Anybody killed over it?'</p>

<p>'Did hear something about somebody's bones being found.'</p>

<p>'Well, if I'm going to make the place by sundown, I must be
getting forward,' I said, gathering up my reins. 'Good day!'</p>

<p>'Good day! Hope you'll enjoy your camp tonight,' and the
traveller and I parted.</p>

<p>It was nearly sundown when I came to the old hut, and at once
determined that, ghost or no ghost, I was going to camp there
that night. The grass, like the grass always is on old camping
grounds in a good season, was thick and sweet; the country was
open; the place was situated on the hank of a well-watered creek;
and the only drawback was the usual one on old camps&mdash;an
absence of firewood. Still, that was not material; the night was
mild, and I could easily get sufficient to boil my solitary
quart.</p>

<p>I promptly unsaddled and hobbled my horses. The other side of
the creek might not have any ghosts; but in other respects it was
by no means as desirable as the side I was on. I was Just
enjoying a pipe, and watching the evening star sinking in the
west, my horse bells tinkling merrily on the flat, when I heard
someone approaching. It was dark, but the pieces of firewood I
had collected to boil my quart were still smouldering red, and
quite sufficient to indicate my camp.</p>

<p>The stranger rode up and got off his horse.</p>

<p>'I suppose you've no objection to my camping here?' he said in
a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>'None at all; you've as much right here as I have,' I
returned.</p>

<p>'Just so; right you are,' and the traveller dropped down
heavily on his feet, as though he was tired out.</p>

<p>'My horse stays well,' he said. 'He won't lead yours away,' he
continued, as he took the saddle off, and led his horse down
towards mine, carrying a pair of hobbles in his hand.</p>

<p>I suggested to him to take the quart-pot with him and bring it
back full of water, and he did so. Meanwhile I made the fire up.
My new companion came back with his bridle, and the quart-pot
full of water. He put the latter down by the fire to boil, and as
the full light fell upon his face I thought I had never seen an
uglier man. His face was disfigured with scars, and his hands
were twisted and distorted; while one of the scars on his face
bad given his mouth a kind of perpetual grin. The scars looked
like burns, and the man's whole appearance was decidedly
unprepossessing.</p>

<p>He had nothing to eat with him, and I provided him with the
necessary materials for a meal, during the progress of which I
inquired about the old pub and the reputation of the place as a
camping ground. He chuckled in his hoarse voice at the
question.</p>

<p>'Maybe It's haunted; maybe it's not. All depends on the date.
Old Ratkins, he comes back once a year regular.'</p>

<p>'Was old Ratkins burnt, then?'</p>

<p>'Sure and certain he was; inside and out, just as he'd burnt
the inside out of many a poor devil before. Burnt their brains
out first, so that they did what they never intended to do, and
then burnt their insides out afterwards. Oh, he was a villain was
old Rat&mdash;a low, torturing, murdering villain. How he
squealed when he was being burned, and how he kicked and tried to
get out, and how the man who did it kept knocking him back again.
Oh! it was glorious sport!'</p>

<p>My strange visitor seemed getting quite excited over the
matter, so I refrained from saying anything more until he cooled
down a bit.</p>

<p>'Were you there?' I asked.</p>

<p>'Perhaps I was, and perhaps I wasn't. Anyhow I knew all about
it&mdash;knew the man who did it, and knew why he did it. Should
you like to hear the story?'</p>

<p>'Yes, very much.'</p>

<p>The ugly man with the scarred face and hands filled his pipe
and lit it, then commenced:</p>

<p><br>
THERE was a fellow named Beames&mdash;Joe
Beames&mdash;carrying about here in Ratkins's time; decent sort
of fellow; didn't drink, 'cept perhaps a nip now and again.
Plenty of work; had a nice little home, and a young wife down at
Ravenslaw, the township. He camps here one night, and went up
with one of his mates to have a nip, and old Rat, who had spotted
him, mixed a dose that stiffened him in one act. Didn't remember
a single thing about ten minutes after he'd drank it.</p>

<p>Mates took him home to his camp, and he awoke in the morning
feeling as though he'd got a fire alight inside him and it had
burnt his tongue hard and stiff. Well, he went up to old Rat, and
you bet your life old Rat gave him some proper stuff to pick
himself up with, and was quite friendly. Beames began to think
him quite a decent sort of chap.</p>

<p>'Look here, Joe,' he says, as though he'd been at school with
him, 'there was a little bit of shouting going on last night, and
you would take a hand; though you was in no ways fit. So I'll
just wipe it off the slate, and we'll say nothing about it. You
might think as how I'd be encouraging men to shout when they were
boozed, which is a thing I never do. Not me. It might be some
people's style, but 'taint mine.'</p>

<p>'Well, of course Joe wouldn't hear of it; would insist on
paying his score, and old Rat wouldn't let him. Finally he did so
most unwillingly on the agreement that he took a bottle of rum
with him for the road. First time Joe had ever had occasion to do
so.</p>

<p>Beames went away thinking what an honest old bloke Ratkins
was, and vowing that he'd always call in there in future. This
was the beginning of old Rat stealing his brain, and he wasn't
long doing it either. By-and-bye things came about that Joe was a
different man altogether, for old Rat, as well as stealing his
brain, was beginning to steal his inside, and he never felt well
or fit for work till be had some of the poison to stop the
gnawing.</p>

<p>I can tell you things soon went from had to worse, and Joe
went down hill as fast as he could. Show you how he stole his
brains, Beames used to be as fond of his wife as a man could be
of a woman, and he began actually, to dislike her when she begged
him to give over drinking and be his old self again. Well, time
drew on, and Joe's wife was not far off from having her first
baby and he was expected down from his last trip, and sure enough
he comes on horseback. Well, his wife was awfully glad to see
that he' had thought of her, and come at all; and was quite
cheerful.</p>

<p>'Where's the team, Joe?' she said, presently pretending not to
notice how bloodshot his eyes were, and how dirty and untidy he
looked.</p>

<p>'Team's gone,' he said, without looking her in the face.</p>

<p>'Team's gone?' she repeated, not knowing what be could
possibly mean, 'Where's the team gone, Joe.'</p>

<p>'Ratkin has it. Showed me a bill he held over it; must have
signed it one time when I was drunk. Don't remember anything
about it.'</p>

<p>'You've lost your team, Joe, lost it for drink?' she said, in
a choking sort of voice. Then she stretched out her hands, and
before Joe could catch her she went right down in a dead
faint.</p>

<p>Well, the women came to help, and the next morning Joe was
sitting there more than half-stupid, with a dead wife and a dead
baby in the next room.</p>

<p>Well, poor Joe Beames, who used to be an independent man, with
a team of his own, a nice little home, and a pretty young wife,
was very soon a drunken loafer: and, worst of all, he got so low
that he became just a knock about wood and water joey at this
very pub of old Ratkins, just for his rations and what drinks Old
Rat and others gave him. This went on for some time, and Joe
Beames was getting worse and worse, when one night a traveller
comes along.'</p>

<p>Here the stranger paused for a minute or two.</p>

<p><br>
'I HAD this part from Joe himself,' he said when he
recommenced, 'otherwise I shouldn't ask you to believe it.
However, I assure you that it's true as Gospel.'</p>

<p>The traveller went in to the bar and looked all round. He was
a tall, dark faced looking chap. The bar was pretty full at the
time, and the chaps say as how became so hot that it felt like
being toasted when that fellow came in.</p>

<p>One fellow says at last, 'Have a drink, mate?' Then the
stranger he laughed like anything, and he says 'Have a drink, why
not? But I'll shout. I'll shout for all hands. 'Fill up, boys,'
and he walked over, to the bar.</p>

<p>'Hullo; you old pirate!' says he; 'How are you? Forgotten me,
eh?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' says Rat 'I can't remember your face just now; yet
somehow it seems familiar.'</p>

<p>'Of course it does, Rat, you old sinner. Trot out your free
fighters (meaning the thick-bottomed tumblers) and shake
hands.'</p>

<p>'He put his hand across the bar, and Rat and he shook hard. My
word, you should have heard old Rat sing out ki-hi!</p>

<p>'You're red hot,' he cried, as he wrung his greedy old paw
with pain.</p>

<p>They all got their drinks and the stranger paid for them. Then
he held up his glass.</p>

<p>Here's the last of old Rat,' he says, and he, drops a match in
his glass and the spirit flared up, and every man looked like a
cold, white corpse as he stood round, looking on. They were all
so scared for an instant they forgot to swallow the liquor till
the stranger tossed it off, all flaming as it was, and then they
drank it and cried 'Here's the last of old Rat!'</p>

<p>'Where's Joe Beames?' said the stranger.</p>

<p>And Joe Beames, somewhat sobered, came up to him.</p>

<p>'Come outside, Joe; I want to speak to you,' and the two went
off together.</p>

<p>'Damme, I don't like those kind of larks,' said old Ratkins.
'Who's that cove?'</p>

<p>Nobody could tell him, and they all felt mighty sober all of a
sudden.</p>

<p>'Joe Beames,' said the stranger; 'do you know who I am?'</p>

<p>Joe shook his head.</p>

<p>'I'm the devil, and I've come for old Ratkins. I'm going to
give you a chance, Joe; a chance to make him feel some of what
he's made you feel. You shall burn his brain and his inside the
same as he burnt yours, and ruined you. Away you go, Joe, and do,
it.'</p>

<p>Joe Beames stood straight up and felt like a man again. He
understood every word the stranger said and what he meant.</p>

<p>The men had fallen to drinking again, when all of a sudden
they found the room full of smoke. It had been coming for some
time, but they hadn't noticed it.</p>

<p>'The house is afire,' said one.</p>

<p>Then the flames burst up with a roar, for a lot of methylated
spirits old Rat kept below had caught. Away went the men, and all
of them got away safe.</p>

<p>Old Rat, he went to his safe to secure his cheques, and money,
and orders, and one thing and another. He was stooped in there,
shoving everything into a bag to carry away, when one of the
beams of the floor gave way, and the floor lurched down. The
heavy door of the safe slammed, and pinned old Rat, and held him
in the middle of that blazing, fiery furnace as burst up suddenly
all round.</p>

<p>Oh, man, it was an awful sight to see the old sinner getting
roasted. And when at last he did get up and staggered along to
get out of the fire, there was only one man game to go in, and
that was Joe Beames. They thought as he was going to help him
out; but no fear. He pushed him back, and he shouted, 'Here's the
last of old Rat;' and when the shrieking old sinner got up again
he went right into the fire and chucked him in again. No matter
how he got burnt, he never felt it, didn't Joe Beames, for the
joy of seeing old Rat burn, as he'd burnt the inside out of many
another man.</p>

<p><br>
THE stranger ceased, and after a bit I asked, 'What became of
Joe Beames?'</p>

<p>'I never heard tell rightly, but anyhow he told me the story,
and you bet it's true.'</p>

<p>The stranger suddenly grew taciturn, and we both of us
remained silent, until I fell asleep. In the middle of the night
I was suddenly awakened by a voice calling out.</p>

<p>I half rose, and listened. From the stumps of the old building
came a cry, in the hoarse voice of the stranger:</p>

<p>'Here's the last of old Rat!' and with it came, too, shrieks
of awful agony.</p>

<p>Much startled, I went over to the place where the stranger had
lain himself down. He was gone, and now all was silent. Nor did I
ever see that man again.</p>

<p>But he certainly came to my camp that night and told me this
story.</p>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 5 Oct 1895</h3>

<p class="first">'SOU-WEST you'll pick up the road from
Watervale,' said the man in charge of the repairing party on the
overland telegraph line, addressing two travellers with led pack
horses; 'but it's almighty rough across there, and I'd advise you
to go back to Watervale, and follow the road, You'll find it
shorter in the end.'</p>

<p>'Don't like turning back,' said one of the men, 'and our
horses are pretty fresh, and shod.'</p>

<p>'Oh, it's not stones so much as sand ridges&mdash;white sand
and pine scrub. However, you'd better turn out here, and start
to-morrow morning, for there's only one place where you can
reckon on water, and that's a creek about half way.'</p>

<p>'What came of the old loony who was knocking about here six
months ago?' said one of the line-men, addressing the crowd in
general as they sat eating their meal that evening.</p>

<p>'Never heard,' returned another; 'but there was some yarn
about his tracks having been seen going out the way you fellows
are going; and another yarn about his horses having turned up at
Watervale, but I never heard the rights of it.'</p>

<p>Next morning the two men started, and towards sundown came to
the creek they had been told about. It was a desolate looking
spot enough; a bare sandy creek, where a trickle of water down
the centre of the bed, cut its way between white sand ridges,
whereon gaunt angular pine trees threw their naked arms about.
There was a little grass on the edge of the bank, and the
travellers soon turned their tired horses out for it had been,
heavy travelling all day.</p>

<p>'What's that half-way up the ridge there, Jack?' said one of
them.</p>

<p>'Blessed if at does not look like a rag of an old tent. Let's
go up and see.'</p>

<p>It was the tattered rags of an old tent which the wind had
blown into ribbons, and the late owner sat with his back to a
tree as if complacently, contemplating the wreck of his property.
He had been dead some months, and the summer heat had dried him
to a mummy.</p>

<p>'What the devil's that round his neck?' said Alf to his mate,
as they stood and surveyed the relic.</p>

<p>They went forward and found a surcingle round the neck of the
corpse, like a running noose, the end of the surcingle having
been passed through the buckle and pulled nearly taut.</p>

<p>'Looks as if he'd been hanged and then let down again,' said
Jack, glancing up the tree.</p>

<p>There was a suspicious bough handily situated just overhead.
They found a pack-saddle and a riding saddle in the camp, and a
few of the rest of the impedimenta a man generally carries in
outside country; but the dogs had been at work, and the leather
had been damaged by the weather.</p>

<p>'I suppose it's the old loony the men spoke of, whoever he
was. I reckon we had better bury him in the morning; it's too
late to-night' said Jack.</p>

<p>'What on earth did he want to come and die here for?' grumbled
Alf, who seemed to look upon it rather in the light of a personal
affront.</p>

<p>'I suppose he couldn't pick and choose his own place, could
he?' retorted Jack. 'Although for the matter of that I don't see
what he had to die of about here. It's not a cheerful spot
certainly, but there's no occasion for a man to die on that
account.</p>

<p>The men cooked and ate their meal, and soon were fast asleep.</p>

<p>Jack woke up in the middle of the night and looked around, and
listened to hear which way the horses were making. It, was bright
moonlight and if the place looked cheerless by day, it looked far
more so at night The white bare sand and the sombre trees, with
their black shadows, did not combine to make up a lively picture.
A wind was wailing too, and made a melancholy sound, amongst the
pine boughs. Jack's attention was drawn by the flapping of the
old tent on the ridge. He looked that way, started, jumped up,
and stared with might and main. He glanced at Alf, but he was
sleeping soundly. What he thought he saw was a dark figure
leaping and waving its arms about under the tree where the corpse
lay.</p>

<p>'Must be a moving bough,' muttered Jack. 'Any way, I'll go and
see without waking Alf.'</p>

<p>Buckling on his belt and revolver, he went noiselessly to the
spot and' came on to a strange sight. The corpse had got up, and
was indulging in strange and unbecoming antics&mdash;springing in
the air; and trying to throw the end of the surcingle that was
round its neck over the branch overhead.</p>

<p>At last it gave up, and moaned so miserably that Jack felt
sorry for it; he was a soft-hearted fellow.</p>

<p>'What's the matter, old man?' he said.</p>

<p>'Matter!' groaned the corpse. 'Why I've got to roost out here
on this ridge without any rest until I've hanged myself.'</p>

<p>'What do you want to hang yourself for? I should have thought
you had no need to do that.' (Jack told me this yarn himself, and
said he felt as cool as a cucumber all through the
interview.)</p>

<p>'You don't understand,' returned the corpse. 'All our family
have hanged themselves. My father, my grandfather, and my uncle
Bill. My cousin Ned was hanged by the hangman. Now, my uncle Bill
was a cantankerous old curmudgeon, who always disliked me, and
before he did it he wrote a letter about his property, and in it
he said, "I mistrust my nephew Frank (that's me); when the time
comes he'll go back on his family, see if he don't."</p>

<p>'And then the old maligner went and did it.</p>

<p>'Now, I felt very hurt about this, and it rather preyed upon
me, so one day I made an attempt to prove old uncle Bill a liar,
but I was cut down and reprimanded by a magistrate, and
altogether made a mess of it. I tried another time; same result.
Same result again a third time, and I was getting about tired of
it. Then I made up my mind to come out away back somewhere where
a man could have a fair show. I got a hankering after the
telegraph posts, but I didn't think it quite fair, because those
chaps on the line were very sociable, so I came out here, and,
would you believe it that very day I started I was taken bad with
the fever.</p>

<p>'You know what the fever is, how it takes it out of a man's
knees and neck and backbone, and everything else. How I managed
to get here, I don't know; but somehow I did, and here I had to
camp. I was bad, and a bit off my head for a few days, and when I
was able to get about I found that my horses had come to the
conclusion that it was a God-forgotten kind of place, and had
cleared out Then it struck me that now was my chance. Here was I,
all alone, no one to cut me down; I'd show Uncle Bill if I was
going to go back on the family. And then, then&mdash;' (Here the
corpse yelled in agony.)</p>

<p>'I was too weak, too gone in the joints, to throw that blessed
surcingle over the branch! I tried, and tried, and tried, and at
last one day I made a sort of a cast of it and half choked
myself, and being so weak I fell down under the tree, and
died.'</p>

<p>The corpse was silent for awhile.</p>

<p>'Ever since then,' went on the defunct, 'I've been tormented
by old Uncle Bill coming and jeering at me, and night after night
I've tried to do it properly and failed, and never a soul has
come to this day to help me. Now,' went on the corpse, in a
coaxing tone, 'would you mind giving me a hand. Just a pull on
the surcingle, you know; throw it over the limb first.'</p>

<p>Jack took up the surcingle and considered. There could be no
harm in hanging a dead man who wanted it so badly. The corpse
took up his position, and he threw the surcingle over the limb,
but it fell too short for him to grasp.</p>

<p>'Wait a minute,' he said, 'I will go and get one of our's and
buckle on.'</p>

<p>Jack went to the camp, and got a surcingle. Alf was still
snoring, and the dead man was awaiting him with a heavenly smile
of expectation on his face.</p>

<p>'Now, then,' said Jack, 'say when you're ready.'</p>

<p>'Ready!' cried the corpse.</p>

<p>'Up you go,' said Jack, and half way up to the limb he went.
Jack took a turn and a couple of half-hitches round a handy
sapling, then, saying 'Good-night' went back to his camp, and
slept soundly until morning.</p>

<p><br>
THE two travellers got up at daylight. Alf went after the
horses, which had gone down the creek in a different direction.
Jack got breakfast ready, and glanced at the place of his
midnight adventure, but there was nothing hanging on the tree, so
he came to the conclusion that it was a nightmare, and made up
his mind to say nothing about it. Presently Alf returned with the
horses, and they had breakfast.</p>

<p>'Suppose we'd better go and bury that chap,' growled Alf.
'Good job it's soft digging.'</p>

<p>Jack assented, and they started. Arrived at the spot Alf
looked round and started.</p>

<p>No wonder! The body lay under the limb, the head a little
distance off, and over the branch dangled the empty noose.
Evidently the defunct's neck had not stood the strain. Jack kept
silence; then Alf strode over to where the second surcingle was
fastened to the sapling, and examined it.</p>

<p>'Blowed if he didn't come down and get my surcingle,' he
muttered as he recognised his initials marked on it. He unbuckled
it and marched off, saying to Jack as he did so, 'Look here, if
that fellow could get up last night and hang himself with my
surcingle, he can just bury himself as well.'</p>

<h2><a id="ch33"></a>33. &mdash; THE GONDERANUPS</h2>

<h3><i>Evening News</i>, Sydney, Australia, 20 May 1899</h3>

<p class="first">THE infinite torment of flies, was everywhere.
They flew down your throat when you opened your mouth, they
clustered in noisome swarms about your eyes, they drowned
themselves by dozens in your tea, and your food was made
repugnant by their crawling over it. Night brought no relief, for
although one could creep under the 'cheese cloth' curtains that
served for mosquito nets, the heat was stifling. All around was
the dry, white plain save where the tongue of timber, wherein the
men were camped, ran out into it.</p>

<p>And from out of that timber rose a bare mound of granite. At
the foot of the mound were two or three rock holes, one a pretty
fair-sized one, half full of water, and round the base of the
mound was a better spring of grass then anywhere else. The two
men there had nothing to do but wait, and waiting under such
circumstances was a weary business.</p>

<p>They were out looking over some new country in Central
Australia, and the man in charge of the party had gone ahead with
one man and a blackboy, leaving them there to await his return,
and mind the spare horses. Day after day they looked anxiously
across the plain hoping to see the returning figures, and night
after night crawled under their nets disappointed. It. was long
past the time when they should have returned, and the men were in
an irritating state of uncertainty as to what to do. To follow
the tracks might lead to trouble, as the absent men might come
back on another course and find them gone.</p>

<p>To continue stopping there doing nothing was well nigh
impossible. Martin stood and looked out across the plain about
two hours before sundown. He stood looking so long and intently
that Rawson, his mate, asked him if he saw anything.</p>

<p>'Yes, there's something bobbing about there. It looks like an
emu coming in to water.'</p>

<p>Rawson, joined him, and both men regarded the approaching
object in silence for some time.</p>

<p>'It's a blackfellow,' said Rawson at last. 'It is, and by
Jingo it's Dandy crawling back along the tracks.'</p>

<p>Picking up a couple of bridles, Martin went to where the
horses were feeding around the granite mound and caught two of
them. Saddling them hastily he started, leading one, towards the
dark figure coming across the plain.</p>

<p>Dandy was a miserable sight to see. His feet were cut and
bleeding; he had thrown his clothes away, and on his side, was a
ghastly wound covered with flies, which he was feebly trying to
beat away with a bough. Martin hastily dismounted, and put the
water bag to his parched lips. Dandy found his voice after a long
drink, and, turning on Martin, eyes of horror and agony, said
hoarsely:</p>

<p>'Them gone. Them two fellow gone.'</p>

<p>'Gone&mdash;gone bung?' inquired Martin, using the common bush
phrase for death.</p>

<p>'Baal, gone away, away alonga debbil, debbil.'</p>

<p>'Here, come on to camp, where you can lie down and we'll dress
your wound,' said Martin roughly, but kindly.</p>

<p>Dandy managed to mount, and they rode slowly back to camp.</p>

<p>'Don't speak to him for a bit until he's had a feed, and a
spell, he seems a. bit dotty,' Martin said to Rawson.</p>

<p>Dandy ate ravenously, and then they examined his wound. It had
a peculiar appearance, and seemed more like the tear of a huge
claw than anything caused by an ordinary weapon. Heat, flies, and
the exhaustion of walking had inflamed it, and a white man would
have succumbed to it quickly. Both men were old station hands,
and had become used to treating wounds on animals, so, though
rough, their surgery was practical.</p>

<p>Somewhat relieved and recovered, Dandy told them a singular
story, which, after allowing for the embroidery of a
blackfellow's fancy, the men could scarcely believe.</p>

<p>According to Dandy, they had found fairly well-watered
country, and were about turning back, whet they caught sight of a
low black range ahead, and Murray, the leader, determined to go
that far in order from the summit to view the land ahead. The
range proved very scrubby and barren and what puzzled Dandy was
that there were large pads or tracks leading through it, and,
although these tracks were dusty and seemingly used by whatever
animal made them, he could see no foot tracks on them.</p>

<p>They reached the top, and from it saw a level expanse of
country partly scrubby, and partly open, with a small lake about
two miles away. It was getting towards sundown, and they went to
this lake, which proved salt. There was fair grass about,
however, and they had water with them, so Murray expressed his
intention of turning the horses out for a few hours' feed, and
turning back by moonlight.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant moonlight night, only two nights off full
moon, and the party were smoking after their meal, when they were
startled by an agonised cry from one of the horses. There is no
sound more startling and painful to hear than the semi-human cry
of a horse in mortal pain and terror, and the men, starting to
their feet, picked up their firearms, and hastened in the
direction of the sound, their natural thought being that the
blacks were spearing the horses.</p>

<p>One horse, a grey, was plunging frantically in its hobbles,
rearing and uttering the terrified scream of pain that had
startled them. As they approached they saw, clinging to the
horse's throat, with claws buried in the shoulders, and its jaws
having a firm grip on the poor creature's throat, what appeared
to be a monstrous lizard.</p>

<p>The horse, as they approached, stood still, trembling all
over, but the horrible thing fastened on it never moved. Putting
his carbine close to its head at an angle that would not hurt the
horse, Murray fired. The claws of the thing relaxed, but the jaws
never opened, and the frightened horse began turning round and
round with the dead creature hanging on to its throat. Then it
staggered, fell, and, with a shuddering gasp, died.</p>

<p>The creature that had attacked it was, in fact, an enormous
sort of lizard, with a huge disproportionate head. The iron jaws,
armed with cruel teeth, still retained their death grip on the
dead horse's throat; from which the blood was now pouring. While
engaged in looking at it Dandy was seized in the side by another
of the horrible creatures. Rafter, the other man, killed it, but
not before it inflicted a terrible wound.</p>

<p>Murray called to them to catch the horses and get away as soon
as they could, for others of the brutes were coming along the
tracks they had noticed. Dandy could not see any footprints
because the lizard's short, stumpy tail obliterated the tracks as
it was dragged over them. Dandy could do nothing but stagger to
camp; while Murray and Rafter ran after the horses to drive them
up.</p>

<p>Dandy heard shouting and shots, but the others did not come
back. He heard another of the creatures crawling towards him,
and, overcome with blind terror, he fled. How long he was getting
back he could not remember.</p>

<p>This was the tale they got from him.</p>

<p>'What can these creatures be?' asked Rawson.</p>

<p>'I've heard of things like that in some parts of Central
America, bat never in Australia.'</p>

<p>'Now I think of it,' said Rawson, 'the blacks do say there are
large lizards about&mdash;that make long pads in and out to their
camping places. They call them&mdash;let's see&mdash;some name
like 'Gonderup.'</p>

<p>'Gonderanup,' corrected Martin. 'Yes, I've heard, them speak
of them, but never knew what they were.'</p>

<p>The men then had a serious discussion as to the best thing to
do. To wait until Dandy was well enough to go back with them was
not to be thought of. They must start that night. By close
questioning they thought they could get from him a fairly
approximate idea of the place. Anyhow, the range and the salt
lake were good landmarks.</p>

<p>As for Dandy, he could spell at the camp until they came back.
There were no signs of blacks about&mdash;no smoke had been
visible&mdash;while they had been there. The place seemed shunned
by the natives, and Dandy would be safe enough. Not that he
particularly enjoyed the idea any more than he did the notion of
going back to the land of the lizards, but there was no help for
it.</p>

<p>Each leading a horse, the two men started, having got a fair
idea from Dandy where they would find water.</p>

<p>They rode on steadily and silently throughput the night, and
in the morning, by a singular piece of good fortune, found
themselves still on the outward trail of Murray and his
companions. This simplified mattes very much, and they had hopes
of sighting the range before sundown.</p>

<p>They reached a rock hole about 10 o'clock, and turned the
horses out for a good long spell during the heat of the day. It
was sundown when they caught sight of the range, evidently some
distance off, and as there was a bit of good feed, and they had
been pushing the horses pretty hard, they determined to camp
until a couple of hours before daylight. They could formulate no
plan until they had seen these creatures and got the lay of the
country; but they had little hope of rescuing their two
companions alive.</p>

<p>They did not sleep much, for they did not know but what
Gonderanups might attack them although they had not yet come
across any of the trails spoken of by Dandy. Still they did not
know how far these creatures took it in their heads to ramble. It
was breaking day when they came to the edge of the scrub that
clothed the range, and here they saw the first of the long
converging trails, or pads, described by Dandy. More than that,
they saw one of the Gonderanups creeping back along the trail, as
though it had been out foraging during the night.</p>

<p>The sound of the horses feet made it stop and turn its
head.</p>

<p>'You're the best shot, Martin,' whispered Rawson. Martin
raised his carbine; the lizard stood defiantly still, and opened
its huge mouth as if in threat. Martin fired, and the thing
turned over, stretched out its short, stumpy legs, furnished with
great claws, and expired.</p>

<p>The two men rode up to it, and, after looking carefully around
to see that no others were near, they dismounted to examine the
brute. It was a stumpy-tailed lizard, about 6ft or 7ft long. Its
legs were short, and the claws were enormous. Above all, its head
seemed to be nearly one-third of its whole length, and the jaws
and teeth were terrifying, even in death.</p>

<p>'I am afraid we shall never find them alive,' said Martin. 'If
these things only come out at night, they should have been able
to get away in the daytime.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps the Gonderanups got them the first night, when Dandy
bolted.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so; I'm afraid they did,' said Martin. 'What horrible
creatures! If one got hold of a man he would never let go until
he was dead.'</p>

<p>'Let's follow the trail along; perhaps this fellow was late,
and they are all camped by now.'</p>

<p>Martin agreed, and they rode along the trail for two miles,
when they reached a fair-sized hole in the ground, and from all
sides tracks such as they were following converged towards this
opening.</p>

<p>'This is their lair, or one lair, at any rate,' said
Martin.</p>

<p>'I remember now the blacks said these things camped
underground all day; and hunted at night, though this country
cannot support, many of them,' and Rawson glanced around at the
barren waste of scrub.</p>

<p>'Will you chance it?' said Martin suddenly.</p>

<p>'What?' asked his companion. 'Why, there's heaps of dry wood
about here. We'll build such a fire over this hole that will
scorch the life out of them if they are not salamanders.'</p>

<p>'I'm on,' said Rawson. 'We must be canny. If they came out
with a rush where would we be?'</p>

<p>The two men dismounted, and, as a precaution, first put two or
three heavy dead logs crosswise above the opening. Then they
filled in underneath: with light wood, dead leaves, and any dry
lumber, and set fire to it. The dry scrubwood burnt like tinder,
and the men, working like stokers, kept piling more wood on until
there was a roaring fire that they could not approach.</p>

<p>Once they saw amid the reek and glare a hideous head, with
eyes burnt out of their sockets, appear for a moment, and fall
back again. This was the only attempt at escape they witnessed,
though for two hours, until they were fairly exhausted, they kept
feeding the fire.</p>

<p>'Not likely they have any other mode of egress,' remarked
Martin.</p>

<p>'No. All the trails seem to die out at the other end.'</p>

<p>'I should like to know how many we have roasted; but we never
shall. Let's get on ahead.'</p>

<p>They were soon at the top of the low range, and could see the
salt lake, which they soon reached. The skeletons, literally
skeletons, of three horses lay around, the flesh clean picked
from the bone; but they both drew a sigh of relief when they rode
round without seeing the sign of man's remains. They found the
saddles; but the camp did not at first look as though it had been
disturbed, until on further searching they discovered that most
of the rations and some cooking utensils were missing.</p>

<p>'Hurrah!' shouted Martin; 'the gonderanups never killed them.
They must have come back to the camp to get these things, and
must be camped about here.'</p>

<p>'What's this?' said Rawson, picking up a piece of paper that
had been tucked under the hook of one of the pack-saddles. They
opened and read the crumpled scrap:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">
'Martin, or Rawson,&mdash;I am camped on the rock mound,
two miles from here, due N.E. I write this in case you follow our
tracks. Rafter is delirious, and I cannot leave him. For God's
sake don't camp near the scrub or at the lake; there are devils
about.'</p>

<br>

<p>Neither spoke after reading this message. Both mounted and
with their led horses rode off due north-east. In a little time
they sighted the granite mound, and shouted and fired off their
revolvers to announce their approach. Murray consequently was at
the base waiting for them when they cantered up.</p>

<p>'Thank Heaven you have come!' he said. 'I have all this time
been nursing poor Rafter; he's mad, and I could not leave him.
Did you see anything of those horrible creatures?'</p>

<p>'Yes; Dandy came back, badly wounded, and told us about
them.'</p>

<p>'I gave up Dandy as dead. How we got away that night I can't
tell; but I managed to save Rafter and three of the horses;
Rafter is terribly bitten; three of them fastened hold of him. He
is round here under some cork trees; at night I carry him to the
top of the rock. There is water here, and I found out that these
things did not come out in the daylight, so I went to our camp
and got some rations.'</p>

<p>While they walked round the hill to see the sick man, Martin
told Murray of their trip out Rafter was bad indeed; his agony
was fearful, and at sundown he died. They buried him at the foot
of the lonely mound&mdash;a fitting headstone for a brave
man&mdash;and then they started homewards. Murray told them he
had shot three of the lizards while on the rock, and as they saw
none afterwards they began to hope that they had destroyed most
of them.</p>

<p>As they approached the place where they had made the fire over
the lair of the brutes, they smelt an intolerable stench&mdash;a
stench that seemed to thicken the air around them&mdash;and they
felt it impossible to approach the spot. This assured them that
they must have killed a good many, and the after settlement of
the country seemed to prove that the whole lot had been
destroyed, as none of the larger variety have been seen since,
although the smaller species is still to be found.</p>

<p>When they approached the camp all was silent. Martin shouted
for Dandy, but got no answer. Poor Dandy was dead. The bite of
the gonderanup seemed to be fatal.</p>

<p>Murray never would tell the whole details of his fight with
the lizards on the bank of the salt lake, when he managed to
bring off his companion. The subject seemed repulsive to him, and
he swore that you could hack the bodies off the creatures, and
their jaws would still remain fixed. They were not natural, he
said, and old blackfellows of that part who remember them say so
too.</p>

<h2><a id="ch34"></a>34. &mdash; MY ONLY MURDER</h2>

<h3><i>My Only Murder and Other Stories</i>, 1899</h3>

<p class="first">IT was simply a choice between killing a man,
and outraging all the finer sensibilities of my nature. Had I not
done the deed I should have had to appear in another man's eyes
as a coldblooded, selfish ingrate. I swear to you that it was to
spare the feelings of both of us that I took upon myself the
terrible responsibility of slaying a fellow-creature.</p>

<p>Do I regret the deed? Not at all.</p>

<p>Twelve years ago, I was just coming to the end of my term of
partnership in a North Queensland station, and well pleased I was
to get out of it, for pastoral property was falling rapidly. My
two partners were not so happy over the matter. The rate at which
they were buying me out had, under our agreement, been fixed some
time previously, and as prices had since steadily fallen, they
had to pay me more than the market value. But, then, had stations
gone up, as was anticipated by them when the rate was agreed
upon, I should have been forced to accept less than the market
value, so it was just the fortune of war.</p>

<p>I had to be up on the station by a fixed date, the wet season
had arrived, and there was not a day to spare. If I did not
attend on the date specified for delivery, it might form a
pretext for the other side to repudiate their bad bargain. The
rain came down steadily, and I knew that my work was cut out to
reach the place in time. Once across the Banderoar river, I was
safe, but when I arrived on the bank it was a swim, and fast
rising. There was too much at stake to hesitate; crocodiles or
not, I must cross. My horse could swim well, I knew, and so could
I. It was growing late, so, without more ado, I undressed,
strapped my clothes on the saddle, unbuckled the reins, crossed
the stirrup-leathers in front, and started.</p>

<p>As soon as old Hielandman (my horse) was out of his depth and
swimming straight, I slipped off and swam alongside him. We were
nearly two-thirds of the way across when suddenly Hielandman
struck against a submerged snag. The shock and the strong current
made me foul him, and ere I could get clear he had clipped me on
the head with his fore-foot. I don't remember much about what
happened immediately afterwards, only it seemed mighty hard to
drown just as I was about to retire with a small competency and
get married. Then I felt cold, and oh! <i>so </i>sick, and, after
an interval, I found myself ashore with a great singing in my
ears and a taste in my mouth as though I had swallowed all the
flood-water in North Queensland.</p>

<p>I had been pulled out by one of a party of men camped on the
bank I was making for. He had bravely jumped in without waiting
to undress, and after being nearly drowned himself, had dragged
me ashore. He was standing by the fire wringing out his wet
clothes, and, with the glow of new-born life within me, I thought
he was the most glorious fellow I had ever seen.</p>

<p>'By Jove, old man!' he said to me cheerily, 'if I had waited
to take my trousers off you would have been feeding the
crocodiles now.'</p>

<p>I did not doubt it, and I told him how deeply grateful I felt,
and how I could never thank him sufficiently. To die just then
would have been especially bitter, and I said so.</p>

<p>Hielandman had got free of the snag and swum to land safely.
Beyond the lump on my head there was no damage done. My new
friends were a party of drovers returning from delivering a mob
of cattle. I camped with them that night, and next morning, with
a light heart, departed for my destination. Needless to say, I
had assured Jenkins, my rescuer, of my undying gratitude, and
told him that whenever he desired it, my home should be his home,
and my purse his purse. He took it all very nicely, told me that
he was sure I would have done the same for him, that he wanted
nothing; but to oblige me, if ever he did become 'stone broke' he
would remember my kind offer.</p>

<p><br>
TWELVE years elapsed. The money I had received for my share
of I he station had, by judicious investment, turned into a nice
little fortune. I was married to a wife exactly suited to me, we
had three healthy children, and lived in good style in one of the
prettiest suburbs of Sydney. I had often told my wife of the
gallant way in which Jenkins, whom I had never since seen,
plunged into the flooded river and rescued me, and she as often
said that it would crown the happiness of her life to see him and
thank him with her own lips.</p>

<p>One day I was accosted in George street by a bearded and
sunburnt bushman dressed in unmistakable slop clothes, who seized
me by the hand and ejaculated, 'But for being told, I should
never have known you. You look a different sort of fellow to what
you did when I pulled you out of the Banderoar. By love, old man,
had I waited to take off my trousers you'd have been a gone
coon!' It was Jenkins, my preserver.</p>

<p>I was delighted to see him and insisted on his coming out to
stay with me. He agreed willingly, and I was at last able to
present to my wife the saviour of her husband. That she was
disappointed, I could see; but, being a good little woman, she
did not let the guest observe it. Truth to tell, I somehow shared
her sentiments. I had, perhaps, rather over done my description,
and had made my wife expect to see something akin to one of
Ouida's heroes. Jenkins certainly did show to better advantage at
his own camp fire than in town in his newly-creased
reach-me-downs, but we forgave all that, and made him royally
welcome. At dinner he was rather awkward, and insisted on telling
my wife the story of my rescue twice over, always emphasising the
fact that, had he stopped to doff his trousers, I should have
been drowned.</p>

<p>From that date there commenced an ordeal which I would not
willingly&mdash;nay, one which I could not&mdash;again endure.
When Jenkins gained a little confidence he became argumentative
and dictatorial. I am a sociable man, and my house was a
favourite with my friends, but Jenkins sat upon them all. He
asserted his opinions loudly and emphatically, and when
unacquainted with the place or topic under discussion, always had
some friend of the past to quote who knew all about it. He held
views on the labour troubles which were rank heresy to my circle
of pastoral friends, but never did he hesitate to loudly assert
them. And yet he was a good fellow, evidently looking upon me as
a sort of a creation of his own.</p>

<p>'Ah!' he would say, as we stood regarding my pretty house, the
sunny, flowering garden, and the children playing on the lawn,
'we should never have seen this if you had gone to the bottom of
the Banderoar. If I had stopped to take off my trousers.'</p>

<p>I felt this, too, and wrung his hand in response. Perhaps that
very evening we had a small dinner-party, and when I saw a demure
smile steal over everybody's face, I knew that in the coming
silence I should hear Jenkins describing what would have happened
had he 'stopped to pull'&mdash;Then, I could have slain him. We
had not a lady friend to whom he had not confided, in a loud
voice, that singular instance of his presence of mind in
refraining from undressing. Those male friends whom Jenkins had
not insulted, I had quarrelled with on account of their frivolity
in always asking me if 'Jenkins had taken his trousers off
yet?'</p>

<p>But the worst of it was that the dear fellow really believed
that he was affording me the most exquisite happiness in
entertaining him. He was convinced that for twelve years I had
been pining to pay off my debt, and that now I was enraptured. He
was my shadow and reverenced everything belonging to me. How
could I break this charm by declaring that I was tired of him? It
would have been worse than heartless.</p>

<p>At last my patient wife began to grow short-tempered and
restless. She told me plainly once that Jenkins had not pulled
<i>her </i>out of the Banderoar, and that she did not see why she
should put up with him any longer. I tried to point out that as
she and I were one it really amounted to the same thing, but she
replied that it certainly did not. We were not married when it
happened, and if I had been drowned she would have married
somebody else&mdash;perhaps someone not oppressed by having
barnacled to him a devoted rescuer who was eternally advertising
that he had not taken off his trousers.</p>

<p>I felt that a climax neared&mdash;and that something must be
done to prevent the breaking up of my once happy home. At times I
meditated investing a portion of my capital in a small selection
somewhere and getting Jenkins to go and look after it for me, but
he expressed himself as being contented where he was, and so
greatly averse to returning to the bush, that I abandoned the
ideas. Now, too, he began to indulge in sheepish flirtations with
the maids, and my wife sternly requested me to 'speak to <i>your
</i>friend.' I attempted to do so, but when I saw his mild,
affectionate eyes gazing at me and knew that he was thinking of
the time when he struggled beneath the muddy flood waters without
taking off his trousers, I broke down. I could not wound his
gentle heart.</p>

<p>It came to me suddenly&mdash;the inspiration, the solution of
the difficulty. Jenkins must die!</p>

<p>Once resolved, I acted. I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't
help it, any more than Deeming could help killing his wives, or
Mr Neill Cream could help poisoning all those poor girls in
London. Jenkins was a friendless bushman; I was a man with
responsibilities and a family. Their happiness stood first, and
it was kinder to Jenkins to kill him at once than to undeceive
him.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into details as to the carrying out of my
design. Enough to say that it was perfectly successful. I have no
intention of teaching the art of murder made easy. Jenkins died
peacefully and painlessly. The doctor said that his constitution
had been undermined by exposure and hardship. When he was
confined to his bed my wife forgave him everything, and nursed
him with unremitting care. I have even seen tears in the poor
little woman's eyes as she murmured that she was afraid we should
lose him. Other people came to see him, and he passed away happy
in the firm belief that he left behind him a large circle of
sorrowing friends.</p>

<p>I buried him in my own ground in Waverley cemetery, and
erected a neat stone with a suitable inscription, stating that he
had risked his life in preserving me from death.</p>

<p>All my old friends are back again. Everybody has told me what
a manly fellow I was, and how they admired my social pluck in not
looking coldly upon an old benefactor who did not happen to be
quite up to the Government House standard of dress and manners.
My conscience is easy.</p>
