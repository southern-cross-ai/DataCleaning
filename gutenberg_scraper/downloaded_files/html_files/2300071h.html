<p class="first">EDWARD PAGE MITCHELL (1852–1927), who worked as
an editor and story writer for the New York daily <i>The
Sun</i>, is recognized as a major figure in the early development
of the science fiction genre.</p>

<p>His works include stories about a time machine ("The Clock that Went Backward," 1881) and an invisible man ("The
Crystal Man," 1881), both of which pre-date H.G. Wells' novels
on these subjects (1895 and 1897).</p>

<p>Other works include stories about faster-than-light travel
("The Tachypomp," 1874), a cyborg ("The Ablest Man in the World,"
1879), teleportation ("The Man without a Body", 1877), and
mind-transfer ("Exchanging Their Souls," 1877).</p>

<p>Besides works of science fiction, Mitchell wrote stories in the fantasy and horror genres.
RGL offers special compilations of tales in all three categories.</p>

<p class="first">
THERE was nothing mysterious about Professor Surd's dislike
for me. I was the only poor mathematician in an exceptionally
mathematical class. The old gentleman sought the lecture-room
every morning with eagerness, and left it reluctantly. For was it
not a thing of joy to find seventy young men who, individually
and collectively, preferred x to XX; who had rather differentiate
than dissipate; and for whom the limbs of the heavenly bodies had
more attractions than those of earthly stars upon the spectacular
stage?</p>

<p>So affairs went on swimmingly between the Professor of
Mathematics and the junior Class at Polyp University. In every
man of the seventy, the sage saw the logarithm of a possible La
Place, of a Sturm, or of a Newton. It was a delightful task for
him to lead them through the pleasant valleys of conic sections,
and beside the still waters of the integral calculus.
Figuratively speaking, his problem was not a hard one. He had
only to manipulate, and eliminate, and to raise to a higher
power, and the triumphant result of examination day was
assured.</p>

<p>But I was a disturbing element, a perplexing unknown quantity,
which had somehow crept into the work, and which seriously
threatened to impair the accuracy of his calculations. It was a
touching sight to behold the venerable mathematician as he
pleaded with me not so utterly to disregard precedent in the use
of cotangents; or as he urged, with eyes almost tearful, that
ordinates were dangerous things to trifle with. All in vain. More
theorems went on to my cuff than into my head. Never did chalk do
so much work to so little purpose. And, therefore, it came that
Furnace Second was reduced to zero in Professor Surd's
estimation. He looked upon me with all the horror which an
unalgebraic nature could inspire. I have seen the professor walk
around an entire square rather than meet the man who had no
mathematics in his soul.</p>

<p>For Furnace Second there were no invitations to Professor
Surd's house. Seventy of the class supped in delegations around
the periphery of the professor's tea-table. The seventy-first
knew nothing of the charms of that perfect ellipse, with its twin
bunches of fuchsias and geraniums in gorgeous precision at the
two foci.</p>

<p>This, unfortunately enough, was no trifling deprivation. Not
that I longed especially for segments of Mrs. Surd's justly
celebrated lemon pies; not that the spheroidal damsons of her
excellent preserving had any marked allurements; not even that I
yearned to hear the professor's jocose table talk about
binomials, and chatty illustrations of abstruse paradoxes. The
explanation is far different. Professor Surd had a daughter.
Twenty years before, he made a proposition of marriage to the
present Mrs. S. He added a little corollary to his proposition
not long after. The corollary was a girl.</p>

<p>Abscissa Surd was as perfectly symmetrical as Giotto's circle,
and as pure, withal, as the mathematics her father taught. It was
just when spring was coming to extract the roots of frozen-up
vegetation that I fell in love with the corollary. That she
herself was not indifferent I soon had reason to regard as a
self-evident truth.</p>

<p>The sagacious reader will already recognize nearly all the
elements necessary to a well-ordered plot. We have introduced a
heroine, inferred a hero, and constructed a hostile parent after
the most approved model. A movement for the story, a <i>Deus ex
machina</i>, is alone lacking. With considerable satisfaction I
can promise a perfect novelty in this line, a <i>Deus ex
machina</i> never before offered to the public.</p>

<p>It would be discounting ordinary intelligence to say that I
sought with unwearying assiduity to figure my way into the stern
father's good-will; that never did dullard apply himself to
mathematics more patiently than I; that never did faithfulness
achieve such meager reward. Then I engaged a private tutor. His
instructions met with no better success.</p>

<p>My tutor's name was Jean Marie Rivarol. He was a unique
Alsatian&mdash;though Gallic in name, thoroughly Teuton in
nature; by birth a Frenchman, by education a German. His age was
thirty; his profession, omniscience; the wolf at his door,
poverty; the skeleton in his closet, a consuming but unrequited
passion. The most recondite principles of practical science were
his toys; the deepest intricacies of abstract science his
diversions. Problems which were foreordained mysteries to me were
to him as clear as Tahoe water. Perhaps this very fact will
explain our lack of success in the relation of tutor and pupil;
perhaps the failure is alone due to my own unmitigated stupidity.
Rivarol had hung about the skirts of the University for several
years; supplying his few wants by writing for scientific
journals, or by giving assistance to students who, like myself,
were characterized by a plethora of purse and a paucity of ideas;
cooking, studying and sleeping in his attic lodgings; and
prosecuting queer experiments all by himself.</p>

<p>We were not long discovering that even this eccentric genius
could not transplant brains into my deficient skull. I gave over
the struggle in despair. An unhappy year dragged its slow length
around. A gloomy year it was, brightened only by occasional
interviews with Abscissa, the Abbie of my thoughts and
dreams.</p>

<p>Commencement day was coming on apace. I was soon to go forth,
with the rest of my class, to astonish and delight a waiting
world. The professor seemed to avoid me more than ever. Nothing
but the conventionalities, I think kept him from shaping his
treatment of me on the basis of unconcealed disgust.</p>

<p>At last, in the very recklessness of despair, I resolved to
see him, plead with him, threaten him if need be, and risk all my
fortunes on one desperate chance. I wrote him a somewhat defiant
letter, stating my aspirations, and, as I flattered myself,
shrewdly giving him a week to get over the first shock of
horrified surprise. Then I was to call and learn my fate.</p>

<p>During the week of suspense I nearly worried myself into a
fever. It was first crazy hope, and then saner despair. On Friday
evening, when I presented myself at the professor's door, I was
such a haggard, sleepy, dragged-out spectre, that even Miss
Jocasta, the harsh-favored maiden sister of the Surd's, admitted
me with commiserate regard, and suggested pennyroyal tea.</p>

<p>Professor Surd was at a faculty meeting. Would I wait?</p>

<p>Yes, till all was blue, if need be. Miss Abbie?</p>

<p>Abscissa had gone to Wheelborough to visit a school friend.
The aged maiden hoped I would make myself comfortable, and
departed to the unknown haunts which knew Jocasta's daily
walk.</p>

<p>Comfortable! But I settled myself in a great uneasy chair and
waited, with the contradictory spirit common to such junctures,
dreading every step lest it should herald the man whom, of all
men, I wished to see.</p>

<p>I had been there at least an hour, and was growing right
drowsy.</p>

<p>At length Professor Surd came in. He sat down in the dusk
opposite me, and I thought his eyes glinted with malignant
pleasure as he said, abruptly:</p>

<p>"So, young man, you think you are a fit husband for my
girl?"</p>

<p>I stammered some inanity about making up in affection what I
lacked in merit; about my expectations, family and the like. He
quickly interrupted me.</p>

<p>"You misapprehend me, sir. Your nature is destitute of those
mathematical perceptions and acquirements which are the only sure
foundations of character. You have no mathematics in you.</p>

<p>"You are fit for treason, stratagems, and
spoils.&mdash;Shakespeare. Your narrow intellect cannot
understand and appreciate a generous mind. There is all the
difference between you and a Surd, if I may say it, which
intervenes between an infinitesimal and an infinite. Why, I will
even venture to say that you do not comprehend the Problem of the
Couriers!"</p>

<p>I admitted that the Problem of the Couriers should be classed
rather without my list of accomplishments than within it. I
regretted this fault very deeply, and suggested amendment. I
faintly hoped that my fortune would be such&mdash;</p>

<p>"Money!" he impatiently exclaimed. "Do you seek to bribe a
Roman senator with a penny whistle? Why, boy, do you parade your
paltry wealth, which, expressed in mills, will not cover ten
decimal places, before the eyes of a man who measures the planets
in their orbits, and close crowds infinity itself?"</p>

<p>I hastily disclaimed any intention of obtruding my foolish
dollars, and he went on:</p>

<p>"Your letter surprised me not a little. I thought you would be
the last person in the world to presume to an alliance here. But
having a regard for you personally"&mdash;and again I saw malice
twinkle in his small eyes&mdash;"an still more regard for
Abscissa's happiness, I have decided that you shall have
her&mdash;upon conditions. Upon conditions," he repeated, with a
half-smothered sneer.</p>

<p>"What are they?" cried I, eagerly enough. "Only name
them."</p>

<p>"Well, sir," he continued, and the deliberation of his speech
seemed the very refinement of cruelty, "you have only to prove
yourself worthy an alliance with a mathematical family. You have
only to accomplish a task which I shall presently give you. Your
eyes ask me what it is. I will tell you. Distinguish yourself in
that noble branch of abstract science in which, you cannot but
acknowledge, you are at present sadly deficient. I will place
Abscissa's hand in yours whenever you shall come before me and
square the circle to my satisfaction. No! That is too easy a
condition. I should cheat myself. Say perpetual motion. How do
you like that? Do you think it lies within the range of your
mental capabilities? You don't smile. Perhaps your talents don't
run in the way of perpetual motion. Several people have found
that theirs didn't. I'll give you another chance. We were
speaking of the Problem of the Couriers, and I think you
expressed a desire to know more of that ingenious question. You
shall have the opportunity. Sit down someday, when you have
nothing else to do, and discover the principle of infinite speed.
I mean the law of motion which shall accomplish an infinitely
great distance in an infinitely short time. You may mix in a
little practical mechanics, if you choose. Invent some method of
taking the tardy Courier over his road at the rate of sixty miles
a minute. Demonstrate me this discovery (when you have made it!)
mathematically, and approximate it practically, and Abscissa is
yours. Until you can, I will thank you to trouble neither myself
nor her."</p>

<p>I could stand his mocking no longer. I stumbled mechanically
out of the room, and out of the house. I even forgot my hat and
gloves. For an hour I walked in the moonlight. Gradually I
succeeded to a more hopeful frame of mind. This was due to my
ignorance of mathematics. Had I understood the real meaning of
what he asked, I should have been utterly despondent.</p>

<p>Perhaps this problem of sixty miles a minute was not so
impossible after all. At any rate I could attempt, though I might
not succeed. And Rivarol came to my mind. I would ask him. I
would enlist his knowledge to accompany my own devoted
perseverance. I sought his lodgings at once.</p>

<p>The man of science lived in the fourth story, back. I had
never been in his room before. When I entered, he was in the act
of filling a beer mug from a carboy labeled <i>aqua
fortis</i>.</p>

<p>"Seat you," he said. "No, not in that chair. That is my Petty
Cash Adjuster." But he was a second too late. I had carelessly
thrown myself into a chair of seductive appearance. To my utter
amazement it reached out two skeleton arms and clutched me with a
grasp against which I struggled in vain. Then a skull stretched
itself over my shoulder and grinned with ghastly familiarity
close to my face.</p>

<p>Rivarol came to my aid with many apologies. He touched a
spring somewhere and the Petty Cash Adjuster relaxed its horrid
hold. I placed myself gingerly in a plain cane-bottomed
rocking-chair, which Rivarol assured me was a safe location.</p>

<p>"That seat," he said, "is an arrangement upon which I much
felicitate myself. I made it at Heidelberg. It has saved me a
vast deal of small annoyance. I consign to its embraces the
friends who bore, and the visitors who exasperate, me. But it is
never so useful as when terrifying some tradesman with an
insignificant account. Hence the pet name which I have
facetiously given it. They are invariably too glad to purchase
release at the price of a bill receipted. Do you well apprehend
the idea?"</p>

<p>While the Alsation diluted his glass of <i>aqua fortis</i>,
shook into it an infusion of bitters, and tossed off the bumper
with apparent relish, I had time to look around the strange
apartment.</p>

<p>The four corners of the room were occupied respectively by a
turning lathe, a Rhumkorff Coil, a small steam engine and an
orrery in stately motion. Tables, shelves, chairs and floor
supported an odd aggregation of tools, retorts, chemicals, gas
receivers, philosophical instruments, boots, flasks, paper-collar
boxes, books diminutive and books of preposterous size. There
were plaster busts of Aristotle, Archimedes, and Comte, while a
great drowsy owl was blinking away, perched on the benign brow of
Martin Farquhar Tupper. "He always roosts there when he proposes
to slumber," explained my tutor. "You are a bird of no ordinary
mind. <i>Schlafen Sie wohl</i>."</p>

<p>Through a closet door, half open, I could see a human-like
form covered with a sheet. Rivarol caught my glance.</p>

<p>"That," said he, "will be my masterpiece. It is a Microcosm,
an Android, as yet only partially complete. And why not? Albertus
Magnus constructed an image perfect to talk metaphysics and
confute the schools. So did Sylvester II; so did Robertus
Greathead. Roger Bacon made a brazen head that held discourses.
But the first named of these came to destruction. Thomas Aquinas
got wrathful at some of its syllogisms and smashed its head. The
idea is reasonable enough. Mental action will yet be reduced to
laws as definite as those which govern the physical. Why should
not I accomplish a manikin which shall preach as original
discourses as the Reverend Dr. Allchin, or talk poetry as
mechanically as Paul Anapest? My android can already work
problems in vulgar fractions and compose sonnets. I hope to teach
it the Positive Philosophy."</p>

<p>Out of the bewildering confusion of his effects Rivarol
produced two pipes and filled them. He handed one to me.</p>

<p>"And here," he said, "I live and am tolerably comfortable.
When my coat wears out at the elbows I seek the tailor and am
measured for another. When I am hungry I promenade myself to the
butcher's and bring home a pound or so of steak, which I cook
very nicely in three seconds by this oxy-hydrogen flame. Thirsty,
perhaps, I send for a carboy of <i>aqua fortis</i>. But I have it
charged, all charged. My spirit is above any small pecuniary
transaction. I loathe your dirty greenbacks, and never handle
what they call scrip."</p>

<p>"But are you never pestered with bills?" I asked. "Don't the
creditors worry your life out?"</p>

<p>"Creditors!" gasped Rivarol. "I have learned no such word in
your very admirable language. He who will allow his soul to be
vexed by creditors is a relic of an imperfect civilization. Of
what use is science if it cannot avail a man who has accounts
current? Listen. The moment you or anyone else enters the outside
door this little electric bell sounds me warning. Every
successive step on Mrs. Grimler's staircase is a spy and informer
vigilant for my benefit. The first step is trod upon. That trusty
first step immediately telegraphs your weight. Nothing could be
simpler. It is exactly like any platform scale. The weight is
registered up here upon this dial. The second step records the
size of my visitor's feet. The third his height, the fourth his
complexion, and so on. By the time he reaches the top of the
first flight I have a pretty accurate description of him right
here at my elbow, and quite a margin of time for deliberation and
action. Do you follow me? It is plain enough. Only the ABC of my
science."</p>

<p>"I see all that," I said, "but I don't see how it helps you
any. The knowledge that a creditor is coming won't pay his bill.
You can't escape unless you jump out of the window."</p>

<p>Rivarol laughed softly. "I will tell you. You shall see what
becomes of any poor devil who goes to demand money of me&mdash;of
a man of science. Ha! ha! It pleases me. I was seven weeks
perfecting my Dun Suppressor. Did you know"&mdash;he whispered
exultingly&mdash;"did you know that there is a hole through the
earth's center? Physicists have long suspected it; I was the
first to find it. You have read how Rhuyghens, the Dutch
navigator, discovered in Kerguellen's Land an abysmal pit which
fourteen hundred fathoms of plumb-line failed to sound. Herr Tom,
that hole has no bottom! It runs from one surface of the earth to
the antipodal surface. It is diametric. But where is the
antipodal spot? You stand upon it. I learned this by the merest
chance. I was deep-digging in Mrs. Grimler's cellar, to bury a
poor cat I had sacrificed in a galvanic experiment, when the
earth under my spade crumbled, caved in, and wonder-stricken I
stood upon the brink of a yawning shaft. I dropped a coal-hod in.
It went down, down, down, bounding and rebounding. In two hours
and a quarter that coal-hod came up again. I caught it and
restored it to the angry Grimler. Just think a minute. The
coal-hod went down, faster and faster, till it reached the center
of the earth. There it would stop, were it not for acquired
momentum. Beyond the center its journey was relatively upward,
toward the opposite surface of the globe. So, losing velocity, it
went slower and slower till it reached that surface. Here it came
to rest for a second and then fell back again, eight thousand odd
miles, into my hands. Had I not interfered with it, it would have
repeated its journey, time after time, each trip of shorter
extent, like the diminishing oscillations of a pendulum, till it
finally came to eternal rest at the center of the sphere. I am
not slow to give a practical application to any such grand
discovery. My Dun Suppressor was born of it. A trap, just outside
my chamber door: a spring in here: a creditor on the trap: need I
say more?"</p>

<p>"But isn't it a trifle inhuman?" I mildly suggested. "Plunging
an unhappy being into a perpetual journey to and from
Kerguellen's Land, without a moment's warning."</p>

<p>"I give them a chance. When they come up the first time I wait
at the mouth of the shaft with a rope in hand. If they are
reasonable and will come to terms, I fling them the line. If they
perish, 'tis their own fault. Only," he added, with a melancholy
smile, "the center is getting so plugged up with creditors that I
am afraid there soon will be no choice whatever for 'em."</p>

<p>By this time I had conceived a high opinion of my tutor's
ability. If anybody could send me waltzing through space at an
infinite speed, Rivarol could do it. I filled my pipe and told
him the story. He heard with grave and patient attention. Then,
for full half an hour, he whiffed away in silence. Finally he
spoke.</p>

<p>"The ancient cipher has overreached himself. He has given you
a choice of two problems, both of which he deems insoluble.
Neither of them is insoluble. The only gleam of intelligence Old
Cotangent showed was when he said that squaring the circle was
too easy. He was right. It would have given you your Liebchen in
five minutes. I squared the circle before I discarded pantalets.
I will show you the work&mdash;but it would be a digression,
and you are in no mood for digressions. Our first chance,
therefore, lies in perpetual motion. Now, my good friend, I will
frankly tell you that, although I have compassed this interesting
problem, I do not choose to use it in your behalf. I too, Herr
Tom, have a heart. The loveliest of her sex frowns upon me. Her
somewhat mature charms are not for Jean Marie Rivarol. She has
cruelly said that her years demand of me filial rather than
connubial regard. Is love a matter of years or of eternity? This
question did I put to the cold, yet lovely Jocasta."</p>

<p>"Jocasta Surd!" I remarked in surprise, "Abscissa's aunt!"</p>

<p>"The same," he said, sadly. "I will not attempt to conceal
that upon the maiden Jocasta my maiden heart has been bestowed.
Give me your hand, my nephew in affliction as in affection!"</p>

<p>Rivarol dashed away a not discreditable tear, and resumed:</p>

<p>"My only hope lies in this discovery of perpetual motion. It
will give me the fame, the wealth. Can Jocasta refuse these? If
she can, there is only the trapdoor and&mdash;Kerguellen's
Land!"</p>

<p>I bashfully asked to see the perpetual-motion machine. My
uncle in affliction shook his head.</p>

<p>"At another time," he said. "Suffice it at present to say,
that it is something upon the principle of a woman's tongue. But
you see now why we must turn in your case to the alternative
condition&mdash;infinite speed. There are several ways in which
this may be accomplished, theoretically. By the lever, for
instance. Imagine a lever with a very long and a very short arm.
Apply power to the shorter arm which will move it with great
velocity. The end of the long arm will move much faster. Now keep
shortening the short arm and lengthening the long one, and as you
approach infinity in their difference of length, you approach
infinity in the speed of the long arm. It would be difficult to
demonstrate this practically to the professor. We must seek
another solution. Jean Marie will meditate. Come to me in a
fortnight. Good-night. But stop! Have you the money&mdash;<i>das Geld</i>?"</p>

<p>"Much more than I need."</p>

<p>"Good! Let us strike hands. Gold and Knowledge; Science and
Love. What may not such a partnership achieve? We go to conquer
thee, Abscissa. <i>Vorwärts</i>!"</p>

<p>When, at the end of a fortnight; I sought Rivarol's chamber, I
passed with some little trepidation over the terminus of the Air
Line to Kerguellen's Land, and evaded the extended arms of the
Petty Cash Adjuster. Rivarol drew a mug of ale for me, and filled
himself a retort of his own peculiar beverage.</p>

<p>"Come," he said at length. "Let us drink success to the
<i>Tachypomp</i>."</p>

<p>"The <i>Tachypomp</i>?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Why not? <i>Tachu</i>, quickly, and <i>pempo,
pepompa</i>, to send. May it send you quickly to your
wedding-day. Abscissa is yours. It is done. When shall we start
for the prairies?"</p>

<p>"Where is it?" I asked, looking in vain around the room for
any contrivance which might seem calculated to advance
matrimonial prospects.</p>

<p>"It is here," and he gave his forehead a significant tap. Then
he held forth didactically.</p>

<p>"There is force enough in existence to yield us a speed of
sixty miles a minute, or even more. All we need is the knowledge
how to combine and apply it. The wise man will not attempt to
make some great force yield some great speed. He will keep adding
the little force to the little force, making each little force
yield its little speed, until an aggregate of little forces shall
be a great force, yielding an aggregate of little speeds, a great
speed. The difficulty is not in aggregating the forces; it lies
in the corresponding aggregation of the speeds. One musket ball
will go, say a mile. It is not hard to increase the force of
muskets to a thousand, yet the thousand musket balls will go no
farther, and no faster, than the one. You see, then, where our
trouble lies. We cannot readily add speed to speed, as we add
force to force. My discovery is simply the utilization of a
principle which extorts an increment of speed from each increment
of power. But this is the metaphysics of physics. Let us be
practical or nothing.</p>

<p>"When you have walked forward, on a moving train, from the
rear car, toward the engine, did you ever think what you were
really doing?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I have generally been going to the smoking car to
have a cigar."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut&mdash;not that! I mean, did it ever occur to you
on such an occasion, that absolutely you were moving faster than
the train? The train passes the telegraph poles at the rate of
thirty miles an hour, say. You walk toward the smoking car at the
rate of four miles an hour. Then you pass the telegraph poles at
the rate of thirty-four miles. Your absolute speed is the speed
of the engine, plus the speed of your own locomotion. Do you
follow me?"</p>

<p>I began to get an inkling of his meaning, and told him so.</p>

<p>"Very well. Let us advance a step. Your addition to the speed
of the engine is trivial, and the space in which you can exercise
it, limited. Now suppose two stations, A and B, two miles distant
by the track. Imagine a train of platform cars, the last car
resting at station A. The train is a mile long, say. The engine
is therefore within a mile of station B. Say the train can move a
mile in ten minutes. The last car, having two miles to go, would
reach B in twenty minutes, but the engine, a mile ahead, would
get there in ten. You jump on the last car, at A, in a prodigious
hurry to reach Abscissa, who is at B. If you stay on the last car
it will be twenty long minutes before you see her. But the engine
reaches B and the fair lady in ten. You will be a stupid
reasoner, and an indifferent lover, if you don't put for the
engine over those platform cars, as fast as your legs will carry
you. You can run a mile, the length of the train, in ten minutes.
Therefore, you reach Abscissa when the engine does, or in ten
minutes&mdash;ten minutes sooner than if you had lazily sat down
upon the rear car and talked politics with the brakeman. You have
diminished the time by one half. You have added your speed to
that of the locomotive to some purpose. <i>Nicht wahr</i>?"</p>

<p>I saw it perfectly; much plainer, perhaps, for his putting in
the clause about Abscissa.</p>

<p>He continued, "This illustration, though a slow one, leads up
to a principle which may be carried to any extent. Our first
anxiety will be to spare your legs and wind. Let us suppose that
the two miles of track are perfectly straight, and make our train
one platform car, a mile long, with parallel rails laid upon its
top. Put a little dummy engine on these rails, and let it run to
and fro along the platform car, while the platform car is pulled
along the ground track. Catch the idea? The dummy takes your
place. But it can run its mile much faster. Fancy that our
locomotive is strong enough to pull the platform car over the two
miles in two minutes. The dummy can attain the same speed. When
the engine reaches B in one minute, the dummy, having gone a mile
a-top the platform car, reaches B also. We have so combined the
speeds of those two engines as to accomplish two miles in one
minute. Is this all we can do? Prepare to exercise your
imagination."</p>

<p>I lit my pipe.</p>

<p>"Still two miles of straight track, between A and B. On the
track a long platform car, reaching from A to within a quarter of
a mile of B. We will now discard ordinary locomotives and adopt
as our motive power a series of compact magnetic engines,
distributed underneath the platform car, all along its
length."</p>

<p>"I don't understand those magnetic engines."</p>

<p>"Well, each of them consists of a great iron horseshoe,
rendered alternately a magnet and not a magnet by an intermittent
current of electricity from a battery, this current in its turn
regulated by clockwork. When the horseshoe is in the circuit, it
is a magnet, and it pulls its clapper toward it with enormous
power. When it is out of the circuit, the next second, it is not
a magnet, and it lets the clapper go. The clapper, oscillating to
and fro, imparts a rotatory motion to a fly wheel, which
transmits it to the drivers on the rails. Such are our motors.
They are no novelty, for trial has proved them practicable.</p>

<p>"With a magnetic engine for every truck of wheels, we can
reasonably expect to move our immense car, and to drive it along
at a speed, say, of a mile a minute.</p>

<p>"The forward end, having but a quarter of a mile to go, will
reach B in fifteen seconds. We will call this platform car number
1. On top of number 1 are laid rails on which another platform
car, number 2, a quarter of a mile shorter than number 1, is
moved in precisely the same way. Number 2, in its turn, is
surmounted by number 3, moving independently of the tiers
beneath, and a quarter of a mile shorter than number 2. Number 2
is a mile and a half long; number 3 a mile and a quarter. Above,
on successive levels, are number 4, a mile long; number 5, three
quarters of a mile; number 6, half a mile; number 7, a quarter of
a mile, and number 8, a short passenger car, on top of all.</p>

<p>"Each car moves upon the car beneath it, independently of all
the others, at the rate of a mile a minute. Each car has its own
magnetic engines. Well, the train being drawn up with the latter
end of each car resting against a lofty bumping-post at A, Tom
Furnace, the gentlemanly conductor, and Jean Marie Rivarol,
engineer, mount by a long ladder to the exalted number 8. The
complicated mechanism is set in motion. What happens?</p>

<p>"Number 8 runs a quarter of a mile in fifteen seconds and
reaches the end of number 7. Meanwhile number 7 has run a quarter
of a mile in the same time and reached the end of number 6;
number 6, a quarter of a mile in fifteen seconds, and reached the
end of number 5; number 5, the end of number 4; number 4, of
number 3; number 3, of number 2; number 2, of number 1. And
number 1, in fifteen seconds, has gone its quarter of a mile
along the ground track, and has reached station B. All this has
been done in fifteen seconds. Wherefore, numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, and 8 come to rest against the bumping-post at B, at
precisely the same second. We, in number 8, reach B just when
number 1 reaches it. In other words, we accomplish two miles in
fifteen seconds. Each of the eight cars, moving at the rate of a
mile a minute, has contributed a quarter of a mile to our
journey, and has done its work in fifteen seconds. All the eight
did their work at once, during the same fifteen seconds.
Consequently we have been whizzed through the air at the somewhat
startling speed of seven and a half seconds to the mile. This is
the Tachypomp. Does it justify the name?"</p>

<p>Although a little bewildered by the complexity of cars, I
apprehended the general principle of the machine. I made a
diagram, and understood it much better. "You have merely improved
on the idea of my moving faster than the train when I was going
to the smoking car?"</p>

<p>"Precisely. So far we have kept within the bounds of the
practicable. To satisfy the professor, you can theorize in
something after this fashion: If we double the number of cars,
thus decreasing by one half the distance which each has to go, we
shall attain twice the speed. Each of the sixteen cars will have
but one eighth of a mile to go. At the uniform rate we have
adopted, the two miles can be done in seven and a half instead of
fifteen seconds. With thirty-two cars, and a sixteenth of a mile,
or twenty rods difference in their length, we arrive at the speed
of a mile in less than two seconds; with sixty-four cars, each
traveling but ten rods, a mile under the second. More than sixty
miles a minute! If this isn't rapid enough for the professor,
tell him to go on, increasing the number of his cars and
diminishing the distance each one has to run. If sixty-four cars
yield a speed of a mile inside the second, let him fancy a
Tachypomp of six hundred and forty cars, and amuse himself
calculating the rate of car number 640. Just whisper to him that
when he has an infinite number of cars with an infinitesimal
difference in their lengths, he will have obtained that infinite
speed for which he seems to yearn. Then demand Abscissa."</p>

<p>I wrung my friend's hand in silent and grateful admiration. I
could say nothing.</p>

<p>"You have listened to the man of theory," he said proudly.
"You shall now behold the practical engineer. We will go to the
west of the Mississippi and find some suitably level locality. We
will erect thereon a model Tachypomp. We will summon thereunto
the professor, his daughter, and why not his fair sister Jocasta,
as well? We will take them a journey which shall much astonish
the venerable Surd. He shall place Abscissa's digits in yours and
bless you both with an algebraic formula. Jocasta shall
contemplate with wonder the genius of Rivarol. But we have much
to do. We must ship to St. Joseph the vast amount of material to
be employed in the construction of the Tachypomp. We must engage
a small army of workmen to effect that construction, for we are
to annihilate time and space. Perhaps you had better see your
bankers."</p>

<p>I rushed impetuously to the door. There should be no
delay.</p>

<p>"Stop! stop! <i>Um Gottes Willen</i>, stop!" shrieked Rivarol.
"I launched my butcher this morning and I haven't bolted
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>But it was too late. I was upon the trap. It swung open with a
crash, and I was plunged down, down, down! I felt as if I were
falling through illimitable space. I remember wondering, as I
rushed through the darkness, whether I should reach Kerguellen's
Land or stop at the center. It seemed an eternity. Then my course
was suddenly and painfully arrested.</p>

<p>I opened my eyes. Around me were the walls of Professor Surd's
study. Under me was a hard, unyielding plane which I knew too
well was Professor Surd's study floor. Behind me was the black,
slippery, haircloth chair which had belched me forth, much as the
whale served Jonah. In front of me stood Professor Surd himself,
looking down with a not unpleasant smile.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Mr. Furnace. Let me help you up. You look
tired, sir. No wonder you fell asleep when I kept you so long
waiting. Shall I get you a glass of wine? No? By the way, since
receiving your letter I find that you are a son of my old friend,
Judge Furnace. I have made inquiries, and see no reason why you
should not make Abscissa a good husband."</p>

<p>Still, I can see no reason why the Tachypomp should not have
succeeded. Can you?</p>

<h2><a id="ch2"></a>02. &mdash; THE SOUL SPECTROSCOPE</h2>

<h3>THE SINGULAR MATERIALISM OF A PROGRESSIVE THINKER</h3>

<h3>PROFESSOR TYNDALL'S VIEWS MORE THAN<br>
JUSTIFIED BY THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE CELE-<br>
BRATED PROFESSOR DUMMKOPF OF BOSTON, MASS.</p>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 19 December 1875</h3>

<p class="first">
BOSTON, December 13&mdash; Professor Dummkopf, a German
gentleman of education and ingenuity, at present residing in this
city, is engaged on experiments which, if successful, will work a
great change both in metaphysical science and in the practical
relationships of life.</p>

<p>The professor is firm in the conviction that modern science
has narrowed down to almost nothing the border territory between
the material and the immaterial. It may be some time, he admits,
before any man shall be able to point his finger and say with
authority, "Here mind begins; here matter ends." It may be found
that the boundary line between mind and matter is as purely
imaginary as the equator that divides the northern from the
southern hemisphere. It may be found that mind is essentially
objective as is matter, or that matter is as entirely Subjective
as is mind. It may be that there is no matter except as
conditioned in mind. It may be that there is no mind except as
conditioned in matter. Professor Dummkopf's views upon this broad
topic are interesting, although somewhat bewildering. I can
cordially recommend the great work in nine volumes,
<i>Körperliche Geisteswissenschaft</i>, to any reader who may be
inclined to follow up the subject. The work can undoubtedly be
obtained in the original Leipzig edition through any responsible
importer of foreign books.</p>

<p>Great as is the problem suggested above, Professor Dummkopf
has no doubt whatever that it will be solved, and at no distant
day. He himself has taken a masterly stride toward a solution by
the brilliant series of experiments I am about to describe. He
not only believes with Tyndall that matter contains the promise
and potency of all life, but he believes that every force,
physical, intellectual, and moral, may be resolved into matter,
formulated in terms of matter, and analyzed into its constituent
forms of matter; that motion is matter, mind is matter, law is
matter, and even that abstract relations of mathematical
abstractions are purely material.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHING SMELL</h3>

<p class="first">
IN accordance with an invitation extended to me at the last
meeting of the Radical Club&mdash;an organization, by the way,
which is doing a noble work in extending our knowledge of the
Unknowable&mdash;I dallied yesterday at Professor Dummkopf's
rooms in Joy Street, at the West End. I found the professor in
his apartment on the upper floor, busily engaged in an attempt to
photograph smell.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, as he stirred up a beaker from which
strongly marked fumes of sulphureted hydrogen were arising and
filling the room, "you see that, having demonstrated the
objectiveness of sensation, it has now become my privilege and
easy task to show that the phenomena of sensation are equally
material. Hence I am attempting to photograph smell."</p>

<p>The professor then darted behind a camera which was leveled
upon the vessel in which the suffocating fumes were generated and
busied himself awhile with the plate.</p>

<p>A disappointed look stole over his face as he brought the
negative to the light and examined it anxiously. "Not yet, not
yet!" he said sadly, "but patience and improved appliances will
finally bring it. The trouble is in my tools, you see, and not in
my theory. I did fancy the other day that I obtained a distinctly
marked negative from the odor of a hot onion stew, and the
thought has cheered me ever since. But it's bound to come. I tell
you, my worthy friend, the actinic ray wasn't made for nothing.
Could you accommodate me with a dollar and a quarter to buy some
more collodion?"</p>

<h3>THE BOTTLE THEORY OF SOUND</h3>

<p class="first">I EXPRESSED my cheerful readiness to be banker
to genius.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the professor, pocketing the scrip and resuming
his position at the camera. "When I have pictorially captured
smell, the most palpable of the senses, the next thing will be to
imprison sound&mdash;vulgarly speaking, to bottle it. Just
think a moment. Force is as imperishable as matter; indeed, as I
have been somewhat successful in showing, it is matter. Now, when
a sound wave is once started, it is only lost through an
indefinite extension of its circumference. Catch that sound wave,
sir! Catch it in a bottle, then its circumference cannot extend.
You may keep the sound wave forever if you will only keep it
corked up tight. The only difficulty is in bottling it in the
first place. I shall attend to the details of that operation just
as soon as I have managed to photograph the confounded rotten-egg
smell of sulphydric acid."</p>

<p>The professor stirred up the offensive mixture with a glass
rod, and continued:</p>

<p>"While my object in bottling sound is mainly scientific, I
must confess that I see in success in that direction a prospect
of considerable pecuniary profit. I shall be prepared at no
distant day to put operas in quart bottles, labeled and assorted,
and contemplate a series of light and popular airs in ounce vials
at prices to suit the times. You know very well that it costs a
ten-dollar bill now to take a lady to hear Martha or Mignon,
rendered in first-class style. By the bottle system, the same
notes may be heard in one's own parlor at a comparatively
trifling expense. I could put the operas into the market at from
eighty cents to a dollar a bottle. For oratorios and symphonies I
should use demijohns, and the cost would of course be greater. I
don't think that ordinary bottles would hold Wagner's music. It
might be necessary to employ carboys. Sir, if I were of the
sanguine habit of you Americans, I should say that there were
millions in it. Being a phlegmatic Teuton, accustomed to the
precision and moderation of scientific language, I will merely
say that in the success of my experiments with sound I see a
comfortable income, as well as great renown."</p>

<h3>A SCIENTIFIC MARVEL</h3>

<p class="first">
BY this time the professor had another negative, but an eager
examination of it yielded nothing more satisfactory than before.
He sighed and continued:</p>

<p>"Having photographed smell and bottled sound, I shall proceed
to a project as much higher than this as the reflective faculties
are higher than the perceptive, as the brain is more exalted than
the ear or nose.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly satisfied that elements of mind are just as
susceptible of detection and analysis as elements of matter. Why,
mind <i>is</i> matter.</p>

<p>"The soul spectroscope, or, as it will better be known,
Dummkopf's duplex self-registering soul spectroscope, is based on
the broad fact that whatever is material may be analyzed and
determined by the position of the Frauenhofer lines upon the
spectrum. If soul is matter, soul may thus be analyzed and
determined. Place a subject under the light, and the minute
exhalations or emanations proceeding from his soul&mdash;and
these exhalations or emanations are, of course, matter&mdash;
will be represented by their appropriate symbols upon the face of
a properly arranged spectroscope.</p>

<p>"This, in short, is my discovery. How I shall arrange the
spectroscope, and how I shall locate the subject with reference
to the light is of course my secret. I have applied for a patent.
I shall exploit the instrument and its practical workings at the
Centennial. Till then I must decline to enter into any more
explicit description of the invention."</p>

<h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE DISCOVERY</h3>

<p class="first">
"WHAT will be the bearing of your great discovery in its
practical workings?"</p>

<p>"I can go so far as to give you some idea of what those
practical workings are. The effect of the soul spectroscope upon
everyday affairs will be prodigious, simply prodigious. All
lying, deceit, double dealing, hypocrisy, will be abrogated under
its operation. It will bring about a millennium of truth and
sincerity.</p>

<p>"A few practical illustrations. No more bell punches on the
horse railroad. The superintendent, with a smattering of
scientific knowledge and one of my soul spectroscopes in his
office, will examine with the eye of infallible science every
applicant for the position of conductor and will determine by the
markings on his spectrum whether there is dishonesty in his soul,
and this as readily as the chemist decides whether there is iron
in a meteorolite or hydrogen in Saturn's ring.</p>

<p>"No more courts, judges, or juries. Hereafter justice will be
represented with both eyes wide open and with one of my duplex
self-registering soul spectroscopes in her right hand. The inmost
nature of the accused will be read at a glance and he will be
acquitted, imprisoned for thirty days, or hung, just as the
Frauenhofer lines which lay bare his soul may determine.</p>

<p>"No more official corruption or politicians' lies. The
important element in every campaign will be one of my soul
spectroscopes, and it will effect the most radical, and, at the
same time, the most practicable of civil service reforms.</p>

<p>"No more young stool pigeons in tall towers. No man will
subscribe for a daily newspaper until a personal inspection of
its editor's soul by means of one of my spectroscopes has
convinced him that he is paying for truth, honest conviction, and
uncompromising independence, rather than for the false utterances
of a hired conscience and a bought judgment.</p>

<p>"No more unhappy marriages. The maiden will bring her glibly
promising lover to me before she accepts or rejects his proposal,
and I shall tell her whether his spectrum exhibits the markings
of pure love, constancy, and tenderness, or of sordid avarice,
vacillating affections, and post-nuptial cruelty. I shall be the
angel with shining sword (or rather spectroscope) who shall
attend Hymen and guard the entrance to his paradise.</p>

<p>"No more shame. If anything be wanting in the character of a
mean, no amount of brazen pretension on his part can place the
missing line in his spectrum. If anything is lacking in him, it
will be lacking there. I found by a long series of experiments
upon the imperfectly constituted minds of the patients in the
lunatic asylum at Taunton&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you have been at Taunton?"</p>

<p>"Yes. For two years I pursued my studies among the unfortunate
inmates of that institution. Not exactly as a patient myself, you
understand, but as a student of the phenomena of morbid
intellectual developments. But I see I am wearying you, and I
must resume my photography before this stuff stops smelling. Come
again."</p>

<p>Having bid the professor farewell and wished him abundant
success in his very interesting experiments, I went home and read
again for the thirty-ninth time Professor Tyndall's address at
Belfast.</p>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>03. &mdash; THE MAN WITHOUT A BODY</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 25 March 1877</h3>

<p class="first">
ON a shelf in the old Arsenal Museum, in the Central Park, in
the midst of stuffed hummingbirds, ermines, silver foxes, and
bright-colored parakeets, there is a ghastly row of human heads.
I pass by the mummified Peruvian, the Maori chief, and the
Flathead Indian to speak of a Caucasian head which has had a
fascinating interest to me ever since it was added to the grim
collection a little more than a year ago.</p>

<p>I was struck with the Head when I first saw it. The pensive
intelligence of the features won me. The face is remarkable,
although the nose is gone, and the nasal fossae are somewhat the
worse for wear. The eyes are likewise wanting, but the empty orbs
have an expression of their own. The parchmenty skin is so
shriveled that the teeth show to their roots in the jaws. The
mouth has been much affected by the ravages of decay, but what
mouth there is displays character. It seems to say: "Barring
certain deficiencies in my anatomy, you behold a man of parts!"
The features of the Head are of the Teutonic cast, and the skull
is the skull of a philosopher. What particularly attracted my
attention, however, was the vague resemblance which this
dilapidated countenance bore to some face which had at some time
been familiar to me&mdash;some face which lingered in my
memory, but which I could not place.</p>

<p>After all, I was not greatly surprised, when I had known the
Head for nearly a year, to see it acknowledge our acquaintance
and express its appreciation of friendly interest on my part by
deliberately winking at me as I stood before its glass case.</p>

<p>This was on a Trustees' Day, and I was the only visitor in the
hall. The faithful attendant had gone to enjoy a can of beer with
his friend, the superintendent of the monkeys.</p>

<p>The Head winked a second time, and even more cordially than
before. I gazed upon its efforts with the critical delight of an
anatomist. I saw the masseter muscle flex beneath the leathery
skin. I saw the play of the glutinators, and the beautiful
lateral movement of the internal platsyma. I knew the Head was
trying to speak to me. I noted the convulsive twitchings of the
risorius and the zygomaticus major, and knew that it was
endeavoring to smile.</p>

<p>"Here," I thought, "is either a case of vitality long after
decapitation, or, an instance of reflex action where there is no
diastaltic or excitor-motory system. In either case the
phenomenon is unprecedented, and should be carefully observed.
Besides, the Head is evidently well disposed toward me." I found
a key on my bunch which opened the glass door.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the Head. "A breath of fresh air is quite a
treat."</p>

<p>"How do you feel?" I asked politely. "How does it seem without
a body?"</p>

<p>The Head shook itself sadly and sighed. "I would give," it
said, speaking through its ruined nose, and for obvious reasons
using chest tones sparingly, "I would give both ears for a single
leg. My ambition is principally ambulatory, and yet I cannot
walk. I cannot even hop or waddle. I would fain travel, roam,
promenade, circulate in the busy paths of men, but I am chained
to this accursed shelf. I am no better off than these barbarian
heads&mdash;I, a man of science! I am compelled to sit here on my
neck and see sandpipers and storks all around me, with legs and
to spare. Look at that infernal little Oedieneninus longpipes
over there. Look at that miserable gray-headed porphyric. They
have no brains, no ambition, no yearnings. Yet they have legs,
legs, legs, in profusion." He cast an envious glance across the
alcove at the tantalizing limbs of the birds in question and
added gloomily, "There isn't even enough of me to make a hero for
one of Wilkie Collins's novels."</p>

<p>I did not exactly know how to console him in so delicate a
manner, but ventured to hint that perhaps his condition had its
compensations in immunity from corns and the gout.</p>

<p>"And as to arms," he went on, "there's another misfortune for
you! I am unable to brush away the flies that get in here&mdash;
Lord knows how&mdash;in the summertime. I cannot reach over and
cuff that confounded Chinook mummy that sits there grinning at me
like a jack-in-the-box. I cannot scratch my head or even blow my
nose (his nose!) decently when I get cold in this thundering
draft. As to eating and drinking, I don't care. My soul is
wrapped up in science. Science is my bride, my divinity. I
worship her footsteps in the past and hail the prophecy of her
future progress. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>I had heard these sentiments before. In a flash I had
accounted for the familiar look which had haunted me ever since I
first saw the Head. "Pardon me," I said, "you are the celebrated
Professor Dummkopf?"</p>

<p>"That is, or was, my name," he replied, with dignity.</p>

<p>"And you formerly lived in Boston, where you carried on
scientific experiments of startling originality. It was you who
first discovered how to photograph smell, how to bottle music,
how to freeze the Aurora Borealis. It was you who first applied
spectral analysis to mind."</p>

<p>"Those were some of my minor achievements," said the Head,
sadly nodding itself&mdash;"small when compared with my final
invention, the grand discovery which was at the same time my
greatest triumph and my ruin. I lost my Body in an
experiment."</p>

<p>"How was that?" I asked. "I had not heard."</p>

<p>"No," said the Head. "I being alone and friendless, my
disappearance was hardly noticed. I will tell you."</p>

<p>There was a sound upon the stairway. "Hush!" cried the Head.
"Here comes somebody. We must not be discovered. You must
dissemble."</p>

<p>I hastily closed the door of the glass case, locking it just
in time to evade the vigilance of the returning keeper, and
dissembled by pretending to examine, with great interest, a
nearby exhibit.</p>

<p>On the next Trustees' Day I revisited the museum and gave the
keeper of the Head a dollar on the pretense of purchasing
information in regard to the curiosities in his charge. He made
the circuit of the hall with me, talking volubly all the
while.</p>

<p>"That there," he said, as we stood before the Head, "is a
relic of morality presented to the museum fifteen months ago. The
head of a notorious murderer guillotined at Paris in the last
century, sir."</p>

<p>I fancied that I saw a slight twitching about the corners of
Professor Dummkopf's mouth and an almost imperceptible depression
of what was once his left eyelid, but he kept his face remarkably
well under the circumstances. I dismissed my guide with many
thanks for his intelligent services, and, as I had anticipated,
he departed forthwith to invest his easily earned dollar in beer,
leaving me to pursue my conversation with the Head.</p>

<p>"Think of putting a wooden-headed idiot like that," said the
professor, after I had opened his glass prison, "in charge of a
portion, however small, of a man of science&mdash;of the inventor
of the Telepomp! Paris! Murderer! Last century, indeed!" and the
Head shook with laughter until I feared that it would tumble off
the shelf.</p>

<p>"You spoke of your invention, the Telepomp," I suggested.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said the Head, simultaneously recovering its
gravity and its center of gravity; "I promised to tell you how I
happen to be a Man without a Body. You see that some three or
four years ago I discovered the principle of the transmission of
sound by electricity. My telephone, as I called it, would have
been an invention of great practical utility if I had been spared
to introduce it to the public. But, alas&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse the interruption," I said, "but I must inform you that
somebody else has recently accomplished the same thing. The
telephone is a realized fact."</p>

<p>"Have they gone any further?" he eagerly asked. "Have they
discovered the great secret of the transmission of atoms? In
other words, have they accomplished the Telepomp?"</p>

<p>"I have heard nothing of the kind," I hastened to assure him,
"but what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Listen," he said. "In the course of my experiments with the
telephone I became convinced that the same principle was capable
of indefinite expansion. Matter is made up of molecules, and
molecules, in their turn, are made up of atoms. The atom, you
know, is the unit of being. The molecules differ according to the
number and the arrangement of their constituent atoms. Chemical
changes are effected by the dissolution of the atoms in the
molecules and their rearrangements into molecules of another
kind. This dissolution may be accomplished by chemical affinity
or by a sufficiently strong electric current. Do you follow
me?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly."</p>

<p>"Well, then, following out this line of thought, I conceived a
great idea. There was no reason why matter could not be
telegraphed, or, to be etymologically accurate, 'telepomped.' It
was only necessary to effect at one end of the line the
disintegration of the molecules into atoms and to convey the
vibrations of the chemical dissolution by electricity to the
other pole, where a corresponding reconstruction could be
effected from other atoms. As all atoms are alike, their
arrangement into molecules of the same order, and the arrangement
of those molecules into an organization similar to the original
organization, would be practically a reproduction of the
original. It would be a materialization&mdash;not in the sense of
the spiritualists' cant, but in all the truth and logic of stern
science. Do you still follow me?"</p>

<p>"It is a little misty," I said, "but I think I get the point.
You would telegraph the Idea of the matter, to use the word Idea
in Plato's sense."</p>

<p>"Precisely. A candle flame is the same candle flame although
the burning gas is continually changing. A wave on the surface of
water is the same wave, although the water composing it is
shifting as it moves. A man is the same man although there is not
an atom in his body which was there five years before. It is the
form, the shape, the Idea, that is essential. The vibrations that
give individuality to matter may be transmitted to a distance by
wire just as readily as the vibrations that give individuality to
sound. So I constructed an instrument by which I could pull down
matter, so to speak, at the anode and build it up again on the
same plan at the cathode. This was my Telepomp."</p>

<p>"But in practice&mdash;how did the Telepomp work?"</p>

<p>"To perfection! In my rooms on joy Street, in Boston, I had
about five miles of wire. I had no difficulty in sending simple
compounds, such as quartz, starch, and water, from one room to
another over this five-mile coil. I shall never forget the joy
with which I disintegrated a three-cent postage stamp in one room
and found it immediately reproduced at the receiving instrument
in another. This success with inorganic matter emboldened me to
attempt the same thing with a living organism. I caught a
cat&mdash;a black and yellow cat&mdash;and I submitted him to a
terrible current from my two-hundred-cup battery. The cat
disappeared in a twinkling. I hastened to the next room and, to
my immense satisfaction, found Thomas there, alive and purring,
although somewhat astonished. It worked like a charm."</p>

<p>"This is certainly very remarkable."</p>

<p>"Isn't it? After my experiment with the cat, a gigantic idea
took possession of me. If I could send a feline being, why not
send a human being? If I could transmit a cat five miles by wire
in an instant by electricity, why not transmit a man to London by
Atlantic cable and with equal dispatch? I resolved to strengthen
my already powerful battery and try the experiment. Like a
thorough votary of science, I resolved to try the experiment on
myself.</p>

<p>"I do not like to dwell upon this chapter of my experience,"
continued the Head, winking at a tear which had trickled down on
to his cheek and which I gently wiped away for him with my own
pocket handkerchief. "Suffice it that I trebled the cups in my
battery, stretched my wire over housetops to my lodgings in
Phillips Street, made everything ready, and with a solemn
calmness born of my confidence in the theory, placed myself in
the receiving instrument of the Telepomp at my Joy Street office.
I was as sure that when I made the connection with the battery I
would find myself in my rooms in Phillips Street as I was sure of
my existence. Then I touched the key that let on the electricity.
Alas!"</p>

<p>For some moments my friend was unable to speak. At last, with
an effort, he resumed his narrative.</p>

<p>"I began to disintegrate at my feet and slowly disappeared
under my own eyes. My legs melted away, and then my trunk and
arms. That something was wrong, I knew from the exceeding
slowness of my dissolution, but I was helpless. Then my head went
and I lost all consciousness. According to my theory, my head,
having been the last to disappear, should have been the first to
materialize at the other end of the wire. The theory was
confirmed in fact. I recovered consciousness. I opened my eyes in
my Phillips Street apartments. My chin was materializing, and
with great satisfaction I saw my neck slowly taking shape.
Suddenly, and about at the third cervical vertebra, the process
stopped. In a flash I knew the reason. I had forgotten to
replenish the cups of my battery with fresh sulphuric acid, and
there was not electricity enough to materialize the rest of me. I
was a Head, but my body was Lord knows where."</p>

<p>I did not attempt to offer consolation. Words would have been
mockery in the presence of Professor Dummkopf's grief.</p>

<p>"What matters it about the rest?" he sadly continued. "The
house in Phillips Street was full of medical students. I suppose
that some of them found my head, and knowing nothing of me or of
the Telepomp, appropriated it for purposes of anatomical study. I
suppose that they attempted to preserve it by means of some
arsenical preparation. How badly the work was done is shown by my
defective nose. I suppose that I drifted from medical student to
medical student and from anatomical cabinet to anatomical cabinet
until some would-be humorist presented me to this collection as a
French murderer of the last century. For some months I knew
nothing, and when I recovered consciousness I found myself
here.</p>

<p>"Such," added the Head, with a dry, harsh laugh, "is the irony
of fate!"</p>

<p>"Is there nothing I can do for you?" I asked, after a
pause.</p>

<p>"Thank you," the Head replied; "I am tolerably cheerful and
resigned. I have lost pretty much all interest in experimental
science. I sit here day after day and watch the objects of
zoological, ichthyological, ethnological, and conchological
interest with which this admirable museum abounds. I don't know
of anything you can do for me.</p>

<p>"Stay," he added, as his gaze fell once more upon the
exasperating legs of the Oedienenius longpipes opposite him. "If
there is anything I do feel the need of, it is outdoor exercise.
Couldn't you manage in some way to take me out for a walk?"</p>

<p>I confess that I was somewhat staggered by this request, but
promised to do what I could. After some deliberation, I formed a
plan, which was carried out in the following manner:</p>

<p>I returned to the museum that afternoon just before the
closing hour, and hid myself behind the mammoth sea cow, or
Manatus Americanus. The attendant, after a cursory glance through
the hall, locked up the building and departed. Then I came boldly
forth and removed my friend from his shelf. With a piece of stout
twine, I lashed his one or two vertebrae to the headless
vertebrae of a skeleton moa. This gigantic and extinct bird of
New Zealand is heavy-legged, full-breasted, tall as a man, and
has huge, sprawling feet. My friend, thus provided with legs and
arms, manifested extraordinary glee. He walked about, stamped his
big feet, swung his wings, and occasionally broke forth into a
hilarious shuffle. I was obliged to remind him that he must
support the dignity of the venerable bird whose skeleton he had
borrowed. I despoiled the African lion of his glass eyes, and
inserted them in the empty orbits of the Head. I gave Professor
Dummkopf a Fiji war lance for a walking stick, covered him with a
Sioux blanket, and then we issued forth from the old arsenal into
the fresh night air and the moonlight, and wandered arm in arm
along the shores of the quiet lake and through the mazy paths of
the Ramble.</p>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>04. &mdash; THE ABLEST MAN IN THE WORLD</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 4 May 1879</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">IT may or may not be remembered that in 1878 General Ignatieff
spent several weeks of July at the Badischer Hof in Baden. The
public journals gave out that he visited the watering-place for
the benefit of his health, said to be much broken by protracted
anxiety and responsibility in the service of the Czar. But
everybody knew that Ignatieff was just then out of favor at St.
Petersburg, and that his absence from the centers of active
statecraft at a time when the peace of Europe fluttered like a
shuttlecock in the air, between Salisbury and Shouvaloff, was
nothing more or less than politely disguised exile.</p>

<p>I am indebted for the following facts to my friend Fisher, of
New York, who arrived at Baden on the day after Ignatieff, and
was duly announced in the official list of strangers as <i>"Herr
Doctor Professor Fischer, mit Frau Gattin und Bed.
Nordamerika."</i></p>

<p>The scarcity of titles among the traveling aristocracy of
North America is a standing grievance with the ingenious person
who compiles the official list. Professional pride and the
instincts of hospitality alike impel him to supply the lack
whenever he can. He distributes governor, major-general, and
doctor professor with tolerable impartiality, according as the
arriving Americans wear a distinguished, a martial, or a studious
air. Fisher owed his title to his spectacles.</p>

<p>It was still early in the season. The theater had not yet
opened. The hotels were hardly half full, the concerts in the
kiosk at the Conversationshaus were heard by scattering
audiences, and the shopkeepers of the bazaar had no better
business than to spend their time in bewailing the degeneracy of
Baden Baden since an end was put to the play. Few excursionists
disturbed the meditations of the shriveled old custodian of the
tower on the Mercuriusberg. Fisher found the place very
stupid&mdash;as stupid as Saratoga in June or Long Branch in
September. He was impatient to get to Switzerland, but his wife
had contracted a <i>table d'hôte</i> intimacy with a Polish
countess, and she positively refused to take any step that would
sever so advantageous a connection.</p>

<p>One afternoon Fisher was standing on one of the little bridges
that span the gutter-wide Oosbach, idly gazing into the water and
wondering whether a good sized Rangely trout could swim the
stream without personal inconvenience, when the porter of the
Badischer Hof came to him on the run.</p>

<p>"Herr Doctor Professor!" cried the porter, touching his cap.
"I pray your pardon, but the highborn the Baron Savitch out of
Moscow, of the General Ignatieff's suite, suffers himself in a
terrible fit, and appears to die."</p>

<p>In vain Fisher assured the porter that it was a mistake to
consider him a medical expert; that he professed no science save
that of draw poker; that if a false impression prevailed in the
hotel it was through a blunder for which he was in no way
responsible; and that, much as he regretted the unfortunate
condition of the highborn the baron out of Moscow, he did not
feel that his presence in the chamber of sickness would be of the
slightest benefit. It was impossible to eradicate the idea that
possessed the porter's mind. Finding himself fairly dragged
toward the hotel, Fisher at length concluded to make a virtue of
necessity and to render his explanations to the baron's
friends.</p>

<p>The Russian's apartments were upon the second floor, not far
from those occupied by Fisher. A French valet, almost beside
himself with terror, came hurrying out of the room to meet the
porter and the doctor professor. Fisher again attempted to
explain, but to no purpose. The valet also had explanations to
make, and the superior fluency of his French enabled him to
monopolize the conversation. No, there was nobody
there&mdash;nobody but himself, the faithful Auguste of the
baron. His Excellency, the General Ignatieff, His Highness, the
Prince Koloff, Dr. Rapperschwyll, all the suite, all the world,
had driven out that morning to Gernsbach. The baron, meanwhile,
had been seized by an effraying malady, and he, Auguste, was
desolate with apprehension. He entreated Monsieur to lose no time
in parley, but to hasten to the bedside of the baron, who was
already in the agonies of dissolution.</p>

<p>Fisher followed Auguste into the inner room. The Baron, in his
boots, lay upon the bed, his body bent almost double by the
unrelenting gripe of a distressful pain. His teeth were tightly
clenched, and the rigid muscles around the mouth distorted the
natural expression of his face. Every few seconds a prolonged
groan escaped him. His fine eyes rolled piteously. Anon, he would
press both hands upon his abdomen and shiver in every limb in the
intensity of his suffering.</p>

<p>Fisher forgot his explanations. Had he been a doctor professor
in fact, he could not have watched the symptoms of the baron's
malady with greater interest.</p>

<p>"Can Monsieur preserve him?" whispered the terrified
Auguste.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said Monsieur, dryly.</p>

<p>Fisher scribbled a note to his wife on the back of a card and
dispatched it in the care of the hotel porter. That functionary
returned with great promptness, bringing a black bottle and a
glass. The bottle had come in Fisher's trunk to Baden all the way
from Liverpool, had crossed the sea to Liverpool from New York,
and had journeyed to New York direct from Bourbon County,
Kentucky. Fisher seized it eagerly but reverently, and held it up
against the light. There were still three inches or three inches
and a half in the bottom. He uttered a grunt of pleasure.</p>

<p>"There is some hope of saving the Baron," he remarked to
Auguste.</p>

<p>Fully one half of the precious liquid was poured into the
glass and administered without delay to the groaning, writhing
patient. In a few minutes Fisher had the satisfaction of seeing
the baron sit up in bed. The muscles around his mouth relaxed,
and the agonized expression was superseded by a look of placid
contentment.</p>

<p>Fisher now had an opportunity to observe the personal
characteristics of the Russian baron. He was a young man of about
thirty-five, with exceedingly handsome and clear-cut features,
but a peculiar head. The peculiarity of his head was that it
seemed to be perfectly round on top&mdash;that is, its diameter
from ear to ear appeared quite equal to its anterior and
posterior diameter. The curious effect of this unusual
conformation was rendered more striking by the absence of all
hair. There was nothing on the baron's head but a tightly fitting
skullcap of black silk. A very deceptive wig hung upon one of the
bed posts.</p>

<p>Being sufficiently recovered to recognize the presence of a
stranger, Savitch made a courteous bow.</p>

<p>"How do you find yourself now?" inquired Fisher, in bad
French.</p>

<p>"Very much better, thanks to Monsieur," replied the baron, in
excellent English, spoken in a charming voice. "Very much better,
though I feel a certain dizziness here." And he pressed his hand
to his forehead.</p>

<p>The valet withdrew at a sign from his master, and was followed
by the porter. Fisher advanced to the bedside and took the
baron's wrist. Even his unpracticed touch told him that the pulse
was alarmingly high. He was much puzzled, and not a little uneasy
at the turn which the affair had taken. "Have I got myself and
the Russian into an infernal scrape?" he thought. "But
no&mdash;he's well out of his teens, and half a tumbler of such
whiskey as that ought not to go to a baby's head."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the new symptoms developed themselves with a
rapidity and poignancy that made Fisher feel uncommonly anxious.
Savitch's face became as white as marble&mdash;its paleness
rendered startling by the sharp contrast of the black skull cap.
His form reeled as he sat on the bed, and he clasped his head
convulsively with both hands, as if in terror lest it burst.</p>

<p>"I had better call your valet," said Fisher, nervously.</p>

<p>"No, no!" gasped the baron. "You are a medical man, and I
shall have to trust you. There is
something&mdash;wrong&mdash;here." With a spasmodic gesture he
vaguely indicated the top of his head.</p>

<p>"But I am not&mdash;" stammered Fisher.</p>

<p>"No words!" exclaimed the Russian, imperiously. "Act at
once&mdash;there must be no delay. Unscrew the top of my
head!"</p>

<p>Savitch tore off his skullcap and flung it aside. Fisher has
no words to describe the bewilderment with which he beheld the
actual fabric of the baron's cranium. The skullcap had concealed
the fact that the entire top of Savitch's head was a dome of
polished silver.</p>

<p>"Unscrew it!" said Savitch again.</p>

<p>Fisher reluctantly placed both hands upon the silver skull and
exerted a gentle pressure toward the left. The top yielded,
turning easily and truly in its threads.</p>

<p>"Faster!" said the baron, faintly. "I tell you no time must be
lost." Then he swooned.</p>

<p>At this instant there was a sound of voices in the outer room,
and the door leading into the baron's bedchamber was violently
flung open and as violently closed. The newcomer was a short,
spare man, of middle age, with a keen visage and piercing,
deepset little gray eyes. He stood for a few seconds scrutinizing
Fisher with a sharp, almost fiercely jealous regard.</p>

<p>The baron recovered his consciousness and opened his eyes.</p>

<p>"Dr. Rapperschwyll!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Dr. Rapperschwyll, with a few rapid strides, approached the
bed and confronted Fisher and Fisher's patient. "What is all
this?" he angrily demanded.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply he laid his hand rudely upon
Fisher's arm and pulled him away from the baron. Fisher, more and
more astonished, made no resistance, but suffered himself to be
led, or pushed, toward the door. Dr. Rapperschwyll opened the
door wide enough to give the American exit, and then closed it
with a vicious slam. A quick click informed Fisher that the key
had been turned in the lock.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THE next morning Fisher met Savitch coming from the
Trinkhalle. The baron bowed with cold politeness and passed on.
Later in the day a valet de place handed to Fisher a small
parcel, with the message: "Dr. Rapperschwyll supposes that this
will be sufficient." The parcel contained two gold pieces of
twenty marks.</p>

<p>Fisher gritted his teeth. "He shall have back his forty
marks," he muttered to himself, "but I will have his confounded
secret in return."</p>

<p>Then Fisher discovered that even a Polish countess has her
uses in the social economy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher's <i>table d'hôte</i> friend was amiability
itself, when approached by Fisher (through Fisher's wife) on the
subject of the Baron Savitch of Moscow. Know anything about the
Baron Savitch? Of course she did, and about everybody else worth
knowing in Europe. Would she kindly communicate her knowledge? Of
course she would, and be enchanted to gratify in the slightest
degree the charming curiosity of her <i>Americaine</i>. It was
quite refreshing for a <i>blasé</i> old woman, who had long since
ceased to feel much interest in contemporary men, women, things
and events, to encounter one so recently from the boundless
prairies of the new world as to cherish a piquant inquisitiveness
about the affairs of the grand monde. Ah! yes, she would very
willingly communicate the history of the Baron Savitch of Moscow,
if that would amuse her dear <i>Americaine</i>.</p>

<p>The Polish countess abundantly redeemed her promise, throwing
in for good measure many choice bits of gossip and scandalous
anecdotes about the Russian nobility, which are not relevant to
the present narrative. Her story, as summarized by Fisher, was
this:</p>

<p>The Baron Savitch was not of an old creation. There was a
mystery about his origin that had never been satisfactorily
solved in St. Petersburg or in Moscow. It was said by some that
he was a foundling from the Vospitatelny Dom. Others believed him
to be the unacknowledged son of a certain illustrious personage
nearly related to the House of Romanoff. The latter theory was
the more probable, since it accounted in a measure for the
unexampled success of his career from the day that he was
graduated at the University of Dorpat.</p>

<p>Rapid and brilliant beyond precedent this career had been. He
entered the diplomatic service of the Czar, and for several years
was attached to the legations at Vienna, London, and Paris.
Created a Baron before his twenty-fifth birthday for the
wonderful ability displayed in the conduct of negotiations of
supreme importance and delicacy with the House of Hapsburg, he
became a pet of Gortchakoff's, and was given every opportunity
for the exercise of his genius in diplomacy. It was even said in
well-informed circles at St. Petersburg that the guiding mind
which directed Russia's course throughout the entire Eastern
complication, which planned the campaign on the Danube, effected
the combinations that gave victory to the Czar's soldiers, and
which meanwhile held Austria aloof, neutralized the immense power
of Germany, and exasperated England only to the point where wrath
expends itself in harmless threats, was the brain of the young
Baron Savitch. It was certain that he had been with Ignatieff at
Constantinople when the trouble was first fomented, with
Shouvaloff in England at the time of the secret conference
agreement, with the Grand Duke Nicholas at Adrianople when the
protocol of an armistice was signed, and would soon be in Berlin
behind the scenes of the Congress, where it was expected that he
would outwit the statesmen of all Europe, and play with Bismarck
and Disraeli as a strong man plays with two kicking babies.</p>

<p>But the countess had concerned herself very little with this
handsome young man's achievements in politics. She had been more
particularly interested in his social career. His success in that
field had been not less remarkable. Although no one knew with
positive certainty his father's name, he had conquered an
absolute supremacy in the most exclusive circles surrounding the
imperial court. His influence with the Czar himself was supposed
to be unbounded. Birth apart, he was considered the best
<i>parti</i> in Russia. From poverty and by the sheer force of
intellect he had won for himself a colossal fortune. Report gave
him forty million roubles, and doubtless report did not exceed
the fact. Every speculative enterprise which he undertook, and
they were many and various, was carried to sure success by the
same qualities of cool, unerring judgment, far-reaching sagacity,
and apparently superhuman power of organizing, combining, and
controlling, which had made him in politics the phenomenon of the
age.</p>

<p>About Dr. Rapperschwyll? Yes, the countess knew him by
reputation and by sight. He was the medical man in constant
attendance upon the Baron Savitch, whose high-strung mental
organization rendered him susceptible to sudden and alarming
attacks of illness. Dr. Rapperschwyll was a Swiss&mdash;had
originally been a watchmaker or artisan of some kind, she had
heard. For the rest, he was a commonplace little old man, devoted
to his profession and to the baron, and evidently devoid of
ambition, since he wholly neglected to turn the opportunities of
his position and connections to the advancement of his personal
fortunes.</p>

<p>Fortified with this information, Fisher felt better prepared
to grapple with Rapperschwyll for the possession of the secret.
For five days he lay in wait for the Swiss physician. On the
sixth day the desired opportunity unexpectedly presented
itself.</p>

<p>Half way up the Mercuriusberg, late in the afternoon, he
encountered the custodian of the ruined tower, coming down. "No,
the tower was not closed. A gentleman was up there, making
observations of the country, and he, the custodian, would be back
in an hour or two." So Fisher kept on his way.</p>

<p>The upper part of this tower is in a dilapidated condition.
The lack of a stairway to the summit is supplied by a temporary
wooden ladder. Fisher's head and shoulders were hardly through
the trap that opens to the platform, before he discovered that
the man already there was the man whom he sought. Dr.
Rapperschwyll was studying the topography of the Black Forest
through a pair of field glasses.</p>

<p>Fisher announced his arrival by an opportune stumble and a
noisy effort to recover himself, at the same instant aiming a
stealthy kick at the topmost round of the ladder, and scrambling
ostentatiously over the edge of the trap. The ladder went down
thirty or forty feet with a racket, clattering and banging
against the walls of the tower.</p>

<p>Dr. Rapperschwyll at once appreciated the situation. He turned
sharply around, and remarked with a sneer, "Monsieur is
unaccountably awkward." Then he scowled and showed his teeth, for
he recognized Fisher.</p>

<p>"It is rather unfortunate," said the New Yorker, with
imperturbable coolness. "We shall be imprisoned here a couple of
hours at the shortest. Let us congratulate ourselves that we each
have intelligent company, besides a charming landscape to
contemplate."</p>

<p>The Swiss coldly bowed, and resumed his topographical studies.
Fisher lighted a cigar.</p>

<p>"I also desire," continued Fisher, puffing clouds of smoke in
the direction of the Teufelsmühle, "to avail myself of this
opportunity to return forty marks of yours, which reached me, I
presume, by a mistake."</p>

<p>"If Monsieur the American physician was not satisfied with his
fee," rejoined Rapperschwyll, venomously, "he can without doubt
have the affair adjusted by applying to the baron's valet."</p>

<p>Fisher paid no attention to this thrust, but calmly laid the
gold pieces upon the parapet, directly under the nose of the
Swiss.</p>

<p>"I could not think of accepting any fee," he said, with
deliberate emphasis. "I was abundantly rewarded for my trifling
services by the novelty and interest of the case."</p>

<p>The Swiss scanned the American's countenance long and steadily
with his sharp little gray eyes. At length he said,
carelessly:</p>

<p>"Monsieur is a man of science?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Fisher, with a mental reservation in favor of
all sciences save that which illuminates and dignifies our
national game.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Dr. Rapperschwyll, "Monsieur will perhaps
acknowledge that a more beautiful or more extensive case of
trephining has rarely come under his observation."</p>

<p>Fisher slightly raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>"And Monsieur will also understand, being a physician,"
continued Dr. Rapperschwyll, "the sensitiveness of the baron
himself, and of his friends upon the subject. He will therefore
pardon my seeming rudeness at the time of his discovery."</p>

<p>"He is smarter than I supposed," thought Fisher. "He holds all
the cards, while I have nothing&mdash;nothing, except a tolerably
strong nerve when it comes to a game of bluff."</p>

<p>"I deeply regret that sensitiveness," he continued, aloud,
"for it had occurred to me that an accurate account of what I
saw, published in one of the scientific journals of England or
America, would excite wide attention, and no doubt be received
with interest on the Continent."</p>

<p>"What you saw?" cried the Swiss, sharply. "It is false. You
saw nothing&mdash;when I entered you had not even removed
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here he stopped short and muttered to himself, as if cursing
his own impetuosity. Fisher celebrated his advantage by tossing
away his half-burned cigar and lighting a fresh one.</p>

<p>"Since you compel me to be frank," Dr. Rapperschwyll went on,
with visibly increasing nervousness, "I will inform you that the
baron has assured me that you saw nothing. I interrupted you in
the act of removing the silver cap."</p>

<p>"I will be equally frank," replied Fisher, stiffening his face
for a final effort. "On that point, the baron is not a competent
witness. He was in a state of unconsciousness for some time
before you entered. Perhaps I was removing the silver cap when
you interrupted me&mdash;"</p>

<p>Dr. Rapperschwyll turned pale.</p>

<p>"And, perhaps," said Fisher, coolly, "I was replacing it."</p>

<p>The suggestion of this possibility seemed to strike
Rapperschwyll like a sudden thunderbolt from the clouds. His
knees parted, and he almost sank to the floor. He put his hands
before his eyes, and wept like a child, or, rather, like a broken
old man.</p>

<p>"He will publish it! He will publish it to the court and to
the world!" he cried, hysterically. "And at this
crisis&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then, by a desperate effort, the Swiss appeared to recover to
some extent his self-control. He paced the diameter of the
platform for several minutes, with his head bent and his arms
folded across the breast. Turning again to his companion, he
said:</p>

<p>"If any sum you may name will&mdash;"</p>

<p>Fisher cut the proposition short with a laugh.</p>

<p>"Then," said Rapperschwyll, "if&mdash;if I throw myself on
your generosity&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?" demanded Fisher.</p>

<p>"And ask a promise, on your honor, of absolute silence
concerning what you have seen?"</p>

<p>"Silence until such time as the Baron Savitch shall have
ceased to exist?"</p>

<p>"That will suffice," said Rapperschwyll. "For when he ceases
to exist I die. And your conditions?"</p>

<p>"The whole story, here and now, and without reservation."</p>

<p>"It is a terrible price to ask me," said Rapperschwyll, "but
larger interests than my pride are at stake. You shall hear the
story.</p>

<p>"I was bred a watchmaker," he continued, after a long pause,
"in the Canton of Zurich. It is not a matter of vanity when I say
that I achieved a marvelous degree of skill in the craft. I
developed a faculty of invention that led me into a series of
experiments regarding the capabilities of purely mechanical
combinations. I studied and improved upon the best automata ever
constructed by human ingenuity. Babbage's calculating machine
especially interested me. I saw in Babbage's idea the germ of
something infinitely more important to the world.</p>

<p>"Then I threw up my business and went to Paris to study
physiology. I spent three years at the Sorbonne and perfected
myself in that branch of knowledge. Meanwhile, my pursuits had
extended far beyond the purely physical sciences. Psychology
engaged me for a time; and then I ascended into the domain of
sociology, which, when adequately understood, is the summary and
final application of all knowledge.</p>

<p>"It was after years of preparation, and as the outcome of all
my studies, that the great idea of my life, which had vaguely
haunted me ever since the Zurich days, assumed at last a
well-defined and perfect form."</p>

<p>The manner of Dr. Rapperschwyll had changed from distrustful
reluctance to frank enthusiasm. The man himself seemed
transformed. Fisher listened attentively and without interrupting
the relation. He could not help fancying that the necessity of
yielding the secret, so long and so jealously guarded by the
physician, was not entirely distasteful to the enthusiast.</p>

<p>"Now, attend, Monsieur," continued Dr. Rapperschwyll, "to
several separate propositions which may seem at first to have no
direct bearing on each other.</p>

<p>"My endeavors in mechanism had resulted in a machine which
went far beyond Babbage's in its powers of calculation. Given the
data, there was no limit to the possibilities in this direction.
Babbage's cogwheels and pinions calculated logarithms, calculated
an eclipse. It was fed with figures, and produced results in
figures. Now, the relations of cause and effect are as fixed and
unalterable as the laws of arithmetic. Logic is, or should be, as
exact a science as mathematics. My new machine was fed with
facts, and produced conclusions. In short, it reasoned; and the
results of its reasoning were always true, while the results of
human reasoning are often, if not always, false. The source of
error in human logic is what the philosophers call the `personal
equation.' My machine eliminated the personal equation; it
proceeded from cause to effect, from premise to conclusion, with
steady precision. The human intellect is fallible; my machine
was, and is, infallible in its processes.</p>

<p>"Again, physiology and anatomy had taught me the fallacy of
the medical superstition which holds the gray matter of the brain
and the vital principle to be inseparable. I had seen men living
with pistol balls imbedded in the medulla oblongata. I had seen
the hemispheres and the cerebellum removed from the crania of
birds and small animals, and yet they did not die. I believed
that, though the brain were to be removed from a human skull, the
subject would not die, although he would certainly be divested of
the intelligence which governed all save the purely involuntary
actions of his body.</p>

<p>"Once more: a profound study of history from the sociological
point of view, and a not inconsiderable practical experience of
human nature, had convinced me that the greatest geniuses that
ever existed were on a plane not so very far removed above the
level of average intellect. The grandest peaks in my native
country, those which all the world knows by name, tower only a
few hundred feet above the countless unnamed peaks that surround
them. Napoleon Bonaparte towered only a little over the ablest
men around him. Yet that little was everything, and he overran
Europe. A man who surpassed Napoleon, as Napoleon surpassed
Murat, in the mental qualities which transmute thought into fact,
would have made himself master of the whole world.</p>

<p>"Now, to fuse these three propositions into one: suppose that
I take a man, and, by removing the brain that enshrines all the
errors and failures of his ancestors away back to the origin of
the race, remove all sources of weakness in his future career.
Suppose, that in place of the fallible intellect which I have
removed, I endow him with an artificial intellect that operates
with the certainty of universal laws. Suppose that I launch this
superior being, who reasons truly, into the hurly-burly of his
inferiors, who reason falsely, and await the inevitable result
with the tranquility of a philosopher.</p>

<p>"Monsieur, you have my secret. That is precisely what I have
done. In Moscow, where my friend Dr. Duchat had charge of the new
institution of St. Vasili for hopeless idiots, I found a boy of
eleven whom they called Stépan Borovitch. Since he was born, he
had not seen, heard, spoken or thought. Nature had granted him,
it was believed, a fraction of the sense of smell, and perhaps a
fraction of the sense of taste, but of even this there was no
positive ascertainment. Nature had walled in his soul most
effectually. Occasional inarticulate murmurings, and an incessant
knitting and kneading of the fingers were his only manifestations
of energy. On bright days they would place him in a little
rocking-chair, in some spot where the sun fell warm, and he would
rock to and fro for hours, working his slender fingers and
mumbling forth his satisfaction at the warmth in the plaintive
and unvarying refrain of idiocy. The boy was thus situated when I
first saw him.</p>

<p>"I begged Stépan Borovitch of my good friend Dr. Duchat. If
that excellent man had not long since died he should have shared
in my triumph. I took Stépan to my home and plied the saw and the
knife. I could operate on that poor, worthless, useless, hopeless
travesty of humanity as fearlessly and as recklessly as upon a
dog bought or caught for vivisection. That was a little more than
twenty years ago. Today Stépan Borovitch wields more power than
any other man on the face of the earth. In ten years he will be
the autocrat of Europe, the master of the world. He never errs;
for the machine that reasons beneath his silver skull never makes
a mistake."</p>

<p>Fisher pointed downward at the old custodian of the tower, who
was seen toiling up the hill.</p>

<p>"Dreamers," continued Dr. Rapperschwyll, "have speculated on
the possibility of finding among the ruins of the older
civilizations some brief inscription which shall change the
foundations of human knowledge. Wiser men deride the dream, and
laugh at the idea of scientific kabbala. The wiser men are fools.
Suppose that Aristotle had discovered on a cuneiform-covered
tablet at Nineveh the few words, 'Survival of the Fittest'
Philosophy would have gained twenty-two hundred years. I will
give you, in almost as few words, a truth equally pregnant. The
ultimate evolution of the creature is into the creator. Perhaps
it will be twenty-two hundred years before the truth finds
general acceptance, yet it is not the less a truth. The Baron
Savitch is my creature, and I am his creator&mdash;creator of
the ablest man in Europe, the ablest man in the world.</p>

<p>"Here is our ladder, Monsieur. I have fulfilled my part of the
agreement. Remember yours."</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
AFTER a two months' tour of Switzerland and the Italian lakes,
the Fishers found themselves at the Hotel Splendide in Paris,
surrounded by people from the States. It was a relief to Fisher,
after his somewhat bewildering experience at Baden, followed by a
surfeit of stupendous and ghostly snow peaks, to be once more
among those who discriminated between a straight flush and a
crooked straight, and whose bosoms thrilled responsive to his own
at the sight of the star-spangled banner. It was particularly
agreeable for him to find at the Hotel Splendide, in a party of
Easterners who had come over to see the Exposition, Miss Bella
Ward, of Portland, a pretty and bright girl, affianced to his
best friend in New York.</p>

<p>With much less pleasure, Fisher learned that the Baron Savitch
was in Paris, fresh from the Berlin Congress, and that he was the
lion of the hour with the select few who read between the written
lines of politics and knew the dummies of diplomacy from the real
players in the tremendous game. Dr. Rapperschwyll was not with
the baron. He was detained in Switzerland, at the deathbed of his
aged mother.</p>

<p>This last piece of information was welcome to Fisher. The more
he reflected upon the interview on the Mercuriusberg, the more
strongly he felt it to be his intellectual duty to persuade
himself that the whole affair was an illusion, not a reality. He
would have been glad, even at the sacrifice of his confidence in
his own astuteness, to believe that the Swiss doctor had been
amusing himself at the expense of his credulity. But the
remembrance of the scene in the baron's bedroom at the Badischer
Hof was too vivid to leave the slightest ground for this theory.
He was obliged to be content with the thought that he should soon
place the broad Atlantic between himself and a creature so
unnatural, so dangerous, so monstrously impossible as the Baron
Savitch.</p>

<p>Hardly a week had passed before he was thrown again into the
society of that impossible person.</p>

<p>The ladies of the American party met the Russian baron at a
ball in the New Continental Hotel. They were charmed with his
handsome face, his refinement of manner, his intelligence and
wit. They met him again at the American Minister's, and, to
Fisher's unspeakable consternation, the acquaintance thus
established began to make rapid progress in the direction of
intimacy. Baron Savitch became a frequent visitor at the Hotel
Splendide.</p>

<p>Fisher does not like to dwell upon this period. For a month
his peace of mind was rent alternately by apprehension and
disgust. He is compelled to admit that the baron's demeanor
toward himself was most friendly, although no allusion was made
on either side to the incident at Baden. But the knowledge that
no good could come to his friends from this association with a
being in whom the moral principle had no doubt been supplanted by
a system of cog-gears, kept him continually in a state of
distraction. He would gladly have explained to his American
friends the true character of the Russian, that he was not a man
of healthy mental organization, but merely a marvel of mechanical
ingenuity, constructed upon a principle subversive of all society
as at present constituted&mdash;in short, a monster whose very
existence must ever be revolting to right-minded persons with
brains of honest gray and white. But the solemn promise to Dr.
Rapperschwyll sealed his lips.</p>

<p>A trifling incident suddenly opened his eyes to the alarming
character of the situation, and filled his heart with a new
horror.</p>

<p>One evening, a few days before the date designated for the
departure of the American party from Havre for home, Fisher
happened to enter the private parlor which was, by common
consent, the headquarters of his set. At first he thought that
the room was unoccupied. Soon he perceived, in the recess of a
window, and partly obscured by the drapery of the curtain, the
forms of the Baron Savitch and Miss Ward of Portland. They did
not observe his entrance. Miss Ward's hand was in the baron's
hand, and she was looking up into his handsome face with an
expression which Fisher could not misinterpret.</p>

<p>Fisher coughed, and going to another window, pretended to be
interested in affairs on the Boulevard. The couple emerged from
the recess. Miss Ward's face was ruddy with confusion, and she
immediately withdrew. Not a sign of embarrassment was visible on
the baron's countenance. He greeted Fisher with perfect
self-possession, and began to talk of the great balloon in the
Place du Carrousel.</p>

<p>Fisher pitied but could not blame the young lady. He believed
her still loyal at heart to her New York engagement. He knew that
her loyalty could not be shaken by the blandishments of any man
on earth. He recognized the fact that she was under the spell of
a power more than human. Yet what would be the outcome? He could
not tell her all; his promise bound him. It would be useless to
appeal to the generosity of the baron; no human sentiments
governed his exorable purposes. Must the affair drift on while he
stood tied and helpless? Must this charming and innocent girl be
sacrificed to the transient whim of an automaton? Allowing that
the baron's intentions were of the most honorable character, was
the situation any less horrible? Marry a Machine! His own loyalty
to his friend in New York, his regard for Miss Ward, alike loudly
called on him to act with promptness.</p>

<p>And, apart from all private interest, did he not owe a plain
duty to society, to the liberties of the world? Was Savitch to be
permitted to proceed in the career laid out for him by his
creator, Dr. Rapperschwyll? He (Fisher) was the only man in the
world in a position to thwart the ambitious programme. Was there
ever greater need of a Brutus?</p>

<p>Between doubts and fears, the last days of Fisher's stay in
Paris were wretched beyond description. On the morning of the
steamer day he had almost made up his mind to act.</p>

<p>The train for Havre departed at noon, and at eleven o'clock
the Baron Savitch made his appearance at the Hotel Splendide to
bid farewell to his American friends. Fisher watched Miss Ward
closely. There was a constraint in her manner which fortified his
resolution. The baron incidentally remarked that he should make
it his duty and pleasure to visit America within a very few
months, and that he hoped then to renew the acquaintances now
interrupted. As Savitch spoke, Fisher observed that his eyes met
Miss Ward's, while the slightest possible blush colored her
cheeks. Fisher knew that the case was desperate, and demanded a
desperate remedy.</p>

<p>He now joined the ladies of the party in urging the baron to
join them in the hasty lunch that was to precede the drive to the
station. Savitch gladly accepted the cordial invitation. Wine he
politely but firmly declined, pleading the absolute prohibition
of his physician. Fisher left the room for an instant, and
returned with the black bottle which had figured in the Baden
episode.</p>

<p>"The Baron," he said, "has already expressed his approval of
the noblest of our American products, and he knows that this
beverage has good medical endorsement." So saying, he poured the
remaining contents of the Kentucky bottle into a glass, and
presented it to the Russian.</p>

<p>Savitch hesitated. His previous experience with the nectar was
at the same time a temptation and a warning, yet he did not wish
to seem discourteous. A chance remark from Miss Ward decided
him.</p>

<p>"The baron," she said, with a smile, "will certainly not
refuse to wish us <i>bon voyage</i> in the American fashion."</p>

<p>Savitch drained the glass and the conversation turned to other
matters. The carriages were already below. The parting
compliments were being made, when Savitch suddenly pressed his
hands to his forehead and clutched at the back of a chair. The
ladies gathered around him in alarm.</p>

<p>"It is nothing," he said faintly; "a temporary dizziness."</p>

<p>"There is no time to be lost," said Fisher, pressing forward.
"The train leaves in twenty minutes. Get ready at once, and I
will meanwhile attend to our friend."</p>

<p>Fisher hurriedly led the baron to his own bedroom. Savitch
fell back upon the bed. The Baden symptoms repeated themselves.
In two minutes the Russian was unconscious.</p>

<p>Fisher looked at his watch. He had three minutes to spare. He
turned the key in the lock of the door and touched the knob of
the electric annunciator.</p>

<p>Then, gaining the mastery of his nerves by one supreme effort
for self-control, Fisher pulled the deceptive wig and the black
skullcap from the baron's head. "Heaven forgive me if I am making
a fearful mistake!" he thought. "But I believe it to be best for
ourselves and for the world." Rapidly, but with a steady hand, he
unscrewed the silver dome. The Mechanism lay exposed before his
eyes. The baron groaned. Ruthlessly Fisher tore out the wondrous
machine. He had no time and no inclination to examine it. He
caught up a newspaper and hastily enfolded it. He thrust the
bundle into his open traveling bag. Then he screwed the silver
top firmly upon the baron's head, and replaced the skullcap and
the wig.</p>

<p>All this was done before the servant answered the bell. "The
Baron Savitch is ill," said Fisher to the attendant, when he
came. "There is no cause for alarm. Send at once to the Hotel de
l'Athénée for his valet, Auguste." In twenty seconds Fisher was
in a cab, whirling toward the Station St. Lazare.</p>

<p>When the steamship <i>Pereire</i> was well out at sea, with
Ushant five hundred miles in her wake, and countless fathoms of
water beneath her keel, Fisher took a newspaper parcel from his
traveling bag. His teeth were firm set and his lips rigid. He
carried the heavy parcel to the side of the ship and dropped it
into the Atlantic. It made a little eddy in the smooth water, and
sank out of sight. Fisher fancied that he heard a wild,
despairing cry, and put his hands to his ears to shut out the
sound. A gull came circling over the steamer&mdash;the cry may
have been the gull's.</p>

<p>Fisher felt a light touch upon his arm. He turned quickly
around. Miss Ward was standing at his side, close to the
rail.</p>

<p>"Bless me, how white you are!" she said. "What in the world
have you been doing?"</p>

<p>"I have been preserving the liberties of two continents,"
slowly replied Fisher, "and perhaps saving your own peace of
mind."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" said she; "and how have you done that?"</p>

<p>"I have done it," was Fisher's grave answer, "by throwing
overboard the Baron Savitch."</p>

<p>Miss Ward burst into a ringing laugh. "You are sometimes too
droll, Mr. Fisher," she said.</p>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>05. THE SENATOR'S DAUGHTER</h2>

<h3>I. &mdash; THE SMALL GOLD BOX</h3>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 27 July 1879</h3>

<p class="first">
ON the evening of the fourth of March, year of grace nineteen
hundred and thirty-seven, Mr. Daniel Webster Wanlee devoted
several hours to the consummation of a rather elaborate toilet.
That accomplished, he placed himself before a mirror and
critically surveyed the results of his patient art.</p>

<p>The effect appeared to give him satisfaction. In the glass he
beheld a comely young man of thirty, something under the medium
stature, faultlessly attired in evening dress. The face was a
perfect oval, the complexion delicate, the features refined. The
high cheekbones and a slight elevation of the outer corners of
the eyes, the short upper lip, from which drooped a slender but
aristocratic mustache, the tapered fingers of the hand, and the
remarkably small feet, confined tonight in dancing pumps of
polished red morocco, were all unmistakable heirlooms of a pure
Mongolian ancestry. The long, stiff, black hair, brushed straight
back from the forehead, fell in profusion over the neck and
shoulders. Several rich decorations shone on the breast of the
black broadcloth coat. The knickerbocker breeches were tied at
the knees with scarlet ribbons. The stockings were of a flowered
silk. Mr. Wanlee's face sparked with intelligent good sense; his
figure poised itself before the glass with easy grace.</p>

<p>A soft, distinct utterance, filling the room yet appearing to
proceed from no particular quarter, now attracted Mr. Wanlee's
attention. He at once recognized the voice of his friend, Mr.
Walsingham Brown.</p>

<p>"How are we off for time, old fellow?"</p>

<p>"It's getting late," replied Mr. Wanlee, without turning his
face from the mirror. "You had better come over directly."</p>

<p>In a very few minutes the curtains at the entrance to Mr.
Wanlee's apartments were unceremoniously pulled open, and Mr.
Walsingham Brown strode in. The two friends cordially shook
hands.</p>

<p>"How is the honorable member from the Los Angeles district?"
inquired the newcomer gaily. "And what is there new in Washington
society? Prepared to conquer tonight, I see. What's all this? Red
ribbons and flowered silk hose! Ah, Wanlee. I thought you had
outgrown these frivolities!"</p>

<p>The faintest possible blush appeared on Mr. Daniel Webster
Wanlee's cheeks. "It is cool tonight?" he asked, changing the
subject.</p>

<p>"Infernally cold," replied his friend. "I wonder you have no
snow here. It is snowing hard in New York. There were at least
three inches on the ground just now when I took the
Pneumatic."</p>

<p>"Pull an easy chair up to the thermo-electrode," said the
Mongolian. "You must get the New York climate thawed out of your
joints if you expect to waltz creditably. The Washington women
are critical in that respect."</p>

<p>Mr. Walsingham Brown pushed a comfortable chair toward a
sphere of shining platinum that stood on a crystal pedestal in
the center of the room. He pressed a silver button at the base,
and the metal globe began to glow incandescently. A genial warmth
diffused itself through the apartment. "That feels good," said
Mr. Walsingham Brown, extending both hands to catch the heat from
the thermo-electrode.</p>

<p>"By the way," he continued, "you haven't accounted to me yet
for the scarlet bows. What would your constituents say if they
saw you thus&mdash;you, the impassioned young orator of the
Pacific slope; the thoughtful student of progressive
statesmanship; the mainstay and hope of the Extreme Left; the
thorn in the side of conservative Vegetarianism; the <i>bête
noire</i> of the whole Indo-European gang&mdash;you, in knee
ribbons and florid extensions, like a club man at a fashionable
Harlem hop, or a&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Brown interrupted himself with a hearty but good-natured
laugh.</p>

<p>Mr. Wanlee seemed ill at ease. He did not reply to his
friend's raillery. He cast a stealthy glance at his knees in the
mirror, and then went to one side of the room, where an endless
strip of printed paper, about three feet wide, was slowly issuing
from between noiseless rollers and falling in neat folds into a
willow basket placed on the floor to receive it. Mr. Wanlee bent
his head over the broad strip of paper and began to read
attentively.</p>

<p>"You take the <i>Contemporaneous News</i>, I suppose," said
the other.</p>

<p>"No, I prefer the <i>Interminable Intelligencer</i>," replied
Mr. Wanlee. "<i>The Contemporaneous</i> is too much of my own way
of thinking. Why should a sensible man ever read the organ of his
own party? How much wiser it is to keep posted on what your
political opponents think and say."</p>

<p>"Do you find anything about the event of the evening?"</p>

<p>"The ball has opened," said Mr. Wanlee, "and the floor of the
Capitol is already crowded. Let me see," he continued, beginning
to read aloud: "'The wealth, the beauty, the chivalry, and the
brains of the nation combine to lend unprecedented luster to the
Inauguration Ball, and the brilliant success of the new
Administration is assured beyond all question.'"</p>

<p>"That is encouraging logic," Mr. Brown remarked.</p>

<p>"'President Trimbelly has just entered the rotunda, escorting
his beautiful and stately wife, and accompanied by ex-President
Riley, Mrs. Riley, and Miss Norah Riley. The illustrious group is
of course the cynosure of all eyes. The utmost cordiality
prevails among statesmen of all shades of opinion. For once,
bitter political animosities seem to have been laid aside with
the ordinary habiliments of everyday wear. Conspicuous among the
guests are some of the most distinguished radicals of the
opposition. Even General Quong, the defeated Mongol-Vegetarian
candidate, is now proceeding across the rotunda, leaning on the
arm of the Chinese ambassador, with the evident intention of
paying his compliments to his successful rival. Not the slightest
trace of resentment or hostility is visible upon his strongly
marked Asiatic features.'"</p>

<p>"The hero of the Battle of Cheyenne can afford to be
magnanimous," remarked Mr. Wanlee, looking up from the paper.</p>

<p>"True," said Mr. Walsingham Brown, warmly. "The noble old
hoodlum fighter has settled forever the question of the equality
of your race. The presidency could have added nothing to his
fame."</p>

<p>Mr. Wanlee went on reading: "'The toilets of the ladies are
charming. Notable among those which attract the reportorial eye
are the peacock feather train of the Princess Hushyida; the
mauve&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Cut that," suggested Mr. Brown. "We shall see for ourselves
presently. And give me a dinner, like a good fellow. It occurs to
me that I have eaten nothing for fifteen days."</p>

<p>The Honorable Mr. Wanlee drew from his waistcoat pocket a
small gold box, oval in form. He pressed a spring and the lid
flew open. Then he handed the box to his friend. It contained a
number of little gray pastilles, hardly larger than peas. Mr.
Brown took one between his thumb and forefinger and put it into
his mouth. "Thus do I satisfy mine hunger," he said, "or, to
borrow the language of the opposition orators, thus do I lend
myself to the vile and degrading practice, subversive of society
as at present constituted, and outraging the very laws of
nature."</p>

<p>Mr. Wanlee was paying no attention. With eager gaze he was
again scanning the columns of the <i>Interminable
Intelligencer</i>. As if involuntarily, he read aloud: "'&mdash;
Secretary Quimby and Mrs. Quimby, Count Schneeke, the Austrian
ambassador, Mrs. Hoyette and the Misses Hoyette of New York,
Senator Newton of Massachusetts, whose arrival with his lovely
daughter is causing no small sensation&mdash;'"</p>

<p>He paused, stammering, for he became aware that his friend was
regarding him earnestly. Coloring to the roots of his hair, he
affected indifference and began to read again: "'Senator Newton
of Massachusetts, whose arrival with his lovely&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"I think, my dear boy," said Mr. Walsingham Brown, with a
smile, "that it is high time for us to proceed to the
Capitol."</p>

<h3>II. &mdash; THE BALL AT THE CAPITOL</h3>

<p class="first">
THROUGH a brilliant throng of happy men and charming women,
Mr. Wanlee and his friend made their way into the rotunda of the
Capitol. Accustomed as they both were to the spectacular efforts
which society arranged for its own delectation, the young men
were startled by the enchantment of the scene before them. The
dingy historical panorama that girds the rotunda was hidden
behind a wall of flowers. The heights of the dome were not
visible, for beneath that was a temporary interior dome of red
roses and white lilies, which poured down from the concavity a
continual and almost oppressive shower of fragrance. From the
center of the floor ascended to the height of forty or fifty feet
a single jet of water, rendered intensely luminous by the newly
discovered hydrolectric process, and flooding the room with a
light ten times brighter than daylight, yet soft and grateful as
the light of the moon. The air pulsated with music, for every
flower in the dome overhead gave utterance to the notes which
Ratibolial, in the <i>conservatoire</i> at Paris, was sending
across the Atlantic from the vibrant tip of his baton.</p>

<p>The friends had hardly reached the center of the rotunda,
where the hydrolectric fountain threw aloft its jet of blazing
water, and where two opposite streams of promenaders from the
north and the south wings of the Capitol met and mingled in an
eddy of polite humanity, before Mr. Walsingham Brown was seized
and led off captive by some of his Washington acquaintances.</p>

<p>Wanlee pushed on, scarcely noticing his friend's defection. He
directed his steps wherever the crowd seemed thickest, casting
ahead and on either side of him quick glances of inquiry, now and
then exchanging bows with people whom he recognized, but pausing
only once to enter into conversation. That was when he was
accosted by General Quong, the leader of the Mongol-Vegetarian
party and the defeated candidate for President in the campaign of
1936. The veteran spoke familiarly to the young congressman and
detained him only a moment. "You are looking for somebody,
Wanlee," said General Quong, kindly. "I see it in your eyes. I
grant you leave of absence."</p>

<p>Mr. Wanlee proceeded down the long corridor that leads to the
Senate chamber, and continued there his eager search.
Disappointed, he turned back, retraced his steps to the rotunda,
and went to the other extremity of the Capitol. The Hall of
Representatives was reserved for the dancers. From the great
clock above the Speaker's desk issued the music of a waltz, to
the rhythm of which several hundred couples were whirling over
the polished floor.</p>

<p>Wanlee stood at the door, watching the couples as they moved
before him in making the circuit of the hall. Presently his eyes
began to sparkle. They were resting upon the beautiful face and
supple figure of a girl in white satin, who waltzed in perfect
form with a young man, apparently an Italian. Wanlee advanced a
step or two, and at the same instant the lady became aware of his
presence. She said a word to her partner, who immediately
relinquished her waist.</p>

<p>"I have been expecting you this age," said the girl, holding
out her hand to Wanlee. "I am delighted that you have come."</p>

<p>"Thank you, Miss Newton," said Wanlee.</p>

<p>"You may retire, Francesco," she continued, turning to the
young man who had just been her partner. "I shall not need you
again."</p>

<p>The young man addressed as Francesco bowed respectfully and
departed without a word.</p>

<p>"Let us not lose this lovely waltz," said Miss Newton, putting
her hand upon Wanlee's shoulder. "It will be my first this
evening."</p>

<p>"Then you have not danced?" asked Wanlee, as they glided off
together.</p>

<p>"No, Daniel," said Miss Newton, "I haven't danced with any
gentlemen."</p>

<p>The Mongolian thanked her with a smile.</p>

<p>"I have made good use of Francesco, however," she went on.
"What a blessing a competent protectional partner is! Only think,
our grandmothers, and even our mothers, were obliged to sit
dismally around the walls waiting the pleasure of their high and
mighty&mdash;"</p>

<p>She paused suddenly, for a shade of annoyance had fallen upon
her partner's face. "Forgive me," she whispered, her head almost
upon his shoulder. "Forgive me if I have wounded you. You know,
love, that I would not&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know it," he interrupted. "You are too good and too noble
to let that weigh a feather's weight in your estimation of the
Man. You never pause to think that my mother and my grandmother
were not accustomed to meet your mother and your grandmother in
society&mdash;for the very excellent reason," he continued,
with a little bitterness in his tone, "that my mother had her
hands full in my father's laundry in San Francisco, while my
grandmother's social ideas hardly extended beyond the cabin of
our ancestral san-pan on the Yangtze Kiang. <i>You</i> do not
care for that. But there are others&mdash;"</p>

<p>They waltzed on for some time in silence, he, thoughtful and
moody, and she, sympathetically concerned.</p>

<p>"And the senator; where is he tonight?" asked Wanlee at
last.</p>

<p>"Papa!" said the girl, with a frightened little glance over
her shoulder. "Oh! Papa merely made his appearance here to bring
me and because it was expected of him. He has gone home to work
on his tiresome speech against the vegetables."</p>

<p>"Do you think," asked Wanlee, after a few minutes, whispering
the words very slowly and very low, "that the senator has any
suspicion?"</p>

<p>It was her turn now to manifest embarrassment. "I am very
sure," she replied, "that Papa has not the least idea in the
world of it all. And that is what worries me. I constantly feel
that we are walking together on a volcano. I know that we are
right, and that heaven means it to be just as it is; yet, I
cannot help trembling in my happiness. You know as well as I do
the antiquated and absurd notions that still prevail in
Massachusetts, and that Papa is a conservative among the
conservatives. He respects your ability, that I discovered long
ago. Whenever you speak in the House, he reads your remarks with
great attention. I think," she continued with a forced laugh,
"that your arguments bother him a good deal."</p>

<p>"This must have an end, Clara," said the Chinaman, as the
music ceased and the waltzers stopped. "I cannot allow you to
remain a day longer in an equivocal position. My honor and your
own peace of mind require that there shall be an explanation to
your father. Have you the courage to stake all our happiness on
one bold move?"</p>

<p>"I have courage," frankly replied the girl, "to go with you
before my father and tell him all. And furthermore," she
continued, slightly pressing his arm and looking into his face
with a charming blush, "I have courage even beyond that."</p>

<p>"You beloved little Puritan!" was his reply.</p>

<p>As they passed out of the Hall of Representatives, they
encountered Mr. Walsingham Brown with Miss Hoyette of New York.
The New York lady spoke cordially to Miss Newton, but recognized
Wanlee with a rather distant bow. Wanlee's eyes sought and met
those of his friend. "I may need your counsel before morning," he
said in a low voice.</p>

<p>"All right, my dear fellow," said Mr. Brown. "Depend on me."
And the two couples separated.</p>

<p>The Mongolian and his Massachusetts sweetheart drifted with
the tide into the supper room. Both were preoccupied with their
own thoughts. Almost mechanically, Wanlee led his companion to a
corner of the supper room and established her in a seat behind a
screen of palmettos, sheltered from the observation of the
throne.</p>

<p>"It is nice of you to bring me here," said the girl, "for I am
hungry after our waltz."</p>

<p>Intimate as their souls had become, this was the first time
that she had ever asked him for food. It was an innocent and
natural request, yet Wanlee shuddered when he heard it, and bit
his under lip to control his agitation. He looked from behind the
palmettos at the tables heaped with delicate viands and
surrounded by men, eagerly pressing forward to obtain refreshment
for the ladies in their care. Wanlee shuddered again at the
spectacle. After a momentary hesitation he returned to Miss
Newton, seated himself beside her, and taking her hand in his,
began to speak deliberately and earnestly.</p>

<p>"Clara," he said, "I am going to ask you for a final proof of
your affection. Do not start and look alarmed, but hear me
patiently. If, after hearing me, you still bid me bring you a
<i>pâté</i>, or the wing of a fowl, or a salad, or even a plate
of fruit, I will do so, though it wrench the heart in my bosom.
But first listen to what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Certainly I will listen to all you have to say," she
replied.</p>

<p>"You know enough of the political theories that divide
parties," he went on, nervously examining the rings on her
slender fingers, "to be aware that what I conscientiously believe
to be true is very different from what you have been educated to
believe."</p>

<p>"I know," said Miss Newton, "that you are a Vegetarian and do
not approve the use of meat. I know that you have spoken
eloquently in the House on the right of every living being to
protection in its life, and that that is the theory of your
party. Papa says that it is demagogy&mdash;that the opposition
parade an absurd and sophistical theory in order to win votes and
get themselves into office. Still, I know that a great many
excellent people, friends of ours in Massachusetts, are coming to
believe with you, and, of course, loving you as I do, I have the
firmest faith in the honesty of your convictions. You are not a
demagogue, Daniel. You are above pandering to the radicalism of
the rabble. Neither my father nor all the world could make me
think the contrary."</p>

<p>Mr. Daniel Webster Wanlee squeezed her hand and went on:</p>

<p>"Living as you do in the most ultra-conservative of circles,
dear Clara, you have had no opportunity to understand the
tremendous significance and force of the movement that is now
sweeping over the land, and of which I am a very humble
representative. It is something more than a political agitation;
it is an upheaval and reorganization of society on the basis of
science and abstract right. It is fit and proper that I,
belonging to a race that has only been emancipated and
enfranchised by the march of time, should stand in the advance
guard&mdash;in the forlorn hope, it may be&mdash;of the new
revolution."</p>

<p>His flaming eyes were now looking directly into hers. Although
a little troubled by his earnestness, she could not hide her
proud satisfaction in his manly bearing.</p>

<p>"We believe that every animal is born free and equal," he
said. "That the humblest polyp or the most insignificant mollusk
has an equal right with you or me to life and the enjoyment of
happiness. Why, are we not all brothers? Are we not all children
of a common evolution? What are we human animals but the more
favored members of the great family? Is Senator Newton of
Massachusetts further removed in intelligence from the Australian
bushman, than the Australian bushman or the Flathead Indian is
removed from the ox which Senator Newton orders slain to yield
food for his family? Have we a right to take the paltriest life
that evolution has given? Is not the butchery of an ox or of a
chicken murder&mdash;nay, fratricide&mdash;in the view of
absolute justice? Is it not cannibalism of the most repulsive and
cowardly sort to prey upon the flesh of our defenseless brother
animals, and to sacrifice their lives and rights to an unnatural
appetite that has no foundation save in the habit of long ages of
barbarian selfishness?"</p>

<p>"I have never thought of these things," said Miss Clara,
slowly. "Would you elevate them to the suffrage&mdash;I mean the
ox and the chicken and the baboon?"</p>

<p>"There speaks the daughter of the senator from Massachusetts,"
cried Wanlee. "No, we would not give them the suffrage&mdash;at
least, not at present. The right to live and enjoy life is a
natural, an inalienable right. The right to vote depends upon
conditions of society and of individual intelligence. The ox, the
chicken, the baboon are not yet prepared for the ballot. But they
are voters in embryo; they are struggling up through the same
process that our own ancestors underwent, and it is a crime, an
unnatural, horrible thing, to cut off their career, their future,
for the sake of a meal!"</p>

<p>"Those are noble sentiments, I must admit," said Miss Newton,
with considerable enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"They are the sentiments of the Mongol-Vegetarian party," said
Wanlee. "They will carry the country in 1940, and elect the next
President of the United States."</p>

<p>"I admire your earnestness," said Miss Newton after a pause,
"and I will not grieve you by asking you to bring me even so much
as a chicken wing. I do not think I could eat it now, with your
words still in my ears. A little fruit is all that I want."</p>

<p>"Once more," said Wanlee, taking the tall girl's hand again,
"I must request you to consider. The principles, my dearest, that
I have already enunciated are the principles of the great mass of
our party. They are held even by the respectable, easygoing, not
oversensitive voters such as constitute the bulk of every
political organization. But there are a few of us who stand on
ground still more advanced. We do not expect to bring the
laggards up to our line for years, perhaps in our lifetime. We
simply carry the accepted theory to its logical conclusions and
calmly await ultimate results."</p>

<p>"And what is your ground, pray?" she inquired. "I cannot see
how anything could be more dreadfully radical&mdash;that is, more
bewildering and generally upsetting at first sight&mdash;than the
ground which you just took."</p>

<p>"If what I have said is true, and I believe it to be true,
then how can we escape including the Vegetable Kingdom in our
proclamation of emancipation from man's tyranny? The tree, the
plant, even the fungus, have they not individual life, and have
they not also the right to live?"</p>

<p>"But how&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And indeed," continued the Chinaman, not noticing the
interruption, "who can say where vegetable life ends and animal
life begins? Science has tried in vain to draw the boundary line.
I hold that to uproot a potato is to destroy an existence
certainly, although perhaps remotely akin to ours. To pluck a
grape is to maim the living vine; and to drink the juice of that
grape is to outrage consanguinity. In this broad, elevated view
of the matter it becomes a duty to refrain from vegetable food.
Nothing less than the vital principal itself becomes the test and
tie of universal brotherhood. 'All living things are born free
and equal, and have a right to existence and the enjoyment of
existence.' Is not that a beautiful thought?"</p>

<p>"It is a beautiful thought," said the maiden. "But&mdash;I
know you will think me dreadfully cold, and practical, and
unsympathetic&mdash;but how are <i>we</i> to live? Have
<i>we</i> no right, too, to existence? Must we starve to death in
order to establish the theoretical right of vegetables not to be
eaten?"</p>

<p>"My dear love," said Wanlee, "that would be a serious and
perplexing question, had not the latest discovery of science
already solved it for us."</p>

<p>He took from his waistcoat pocket the small gold box, scarcely
larger than a watch, and opened the cover. In the palm of her
white hand he placed one of the little pastilles.</p>

<p>"Eat it," said he. "It will satisfy your hunger."</p>

<p>She put the morsel into her mouth. "I would do as you bade
me," she said, "even if it were poison."</p>

<p>"It is not poison," he rejoined. "It is nourishment in the
only rational form."</p>

<p>"But it is tasteless; almost without substance."</p>

<p>"Yet it will support life for from eighteen to twenty-five
days. This little gold box holds food enough to afford all
subsistence to the entire Seventy-sixth Congress for a
month."</p>

<p>She took the box and curiously examined its contents.</p>

<p>"And how long would it support my life&mdash;for more than a
year, perhaps?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for more than ten&mdash;more than twenty years."</p>

<p>"I will not bore you with chemical and physiological facts,"
continued Wanlee, "but you must know that the food which we take,
in whatever form, resolves itself into what are called proximate
principles&mdash;starch, sugar, oleine, flurin, albumen, and so
on. These are selected and assimilated by the organs of the body,
and go to build up the necessary tissues. But all these proximate
principles, in their turn, are simply combinations of the
ultimate chemical elements, chiefly carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen,
and oxygen. It is upon these elements that we depend for
sustenance. By the old plan we obtained them indirectly. They
passed from the earth and the air into the grass; from the grass
into the muscular tissues of the ox; and from the beef into our
own persons, loaded down and encumbered by a mass of useless,
irrelevant matter. The German chemists have discovered how to
supply the needed elements in compact, undiluted form&mdash;here
they are in this little box. Now shall mankind go direct to the
fountainhead of nature for his aliment; now shall the old
roundabout, cumbrous, inhuman method be at an end; now shall the
evils of gluttony and the attendant vices cease; now shall the
brutal murdering of fellow animals and brother vegetables forever
stop&mdash;now shall all this be, since the new, holy cause has
been consecrated by the lips I love!"</p>

<p>He bent and kissed those lips. Then he suddenly looked up and
saw Mr. Walsingham Brown standing at his elbow.</p>

<p>"You are observed&mdash;compromised, I fear," said Mr. Brown,
hurriedly. "That Italian dancer in your employ, Miss Newton, has
been following you like a hound. I have been paying him the same
gracious attention. He has just left the Capitol post haste. I
fear there may be a scene."</p>

<p>The brave girl, with clear eyes, gave her Mongolian lover a
look worth to him a year of life. "There shall be no scene," she
said; "we will go at once to my father, Daniel, and bear
ourselves the tale which Francesco would carry."</p>

<p>The three left the Capitol without delay. At the head of
Pennsylvania Avenue they entered a great building, lighted up as
brilliantly as the Capitol itself. An elevator took them down
toward the bowels of the earth. At the fourth landing they passed
from the elevator into a small carriage, luxuriously upholstered.
Mr. Walsingham Brown touched an ivory knob at the end of the
conveyance. A man in uniform presented himself at the door.</p>

<p>"To Boston," said Mr. Walsingham Brown.</p>

<h3>III. &mdash; THE FROZEN BRIDE</h3>

<p class="first">
THE senator from Massachusetts sat in the library of his
mansion on North Street at two o'clock in the morning. An
expression of astonishment and rage distorted his pale, cold
features. The pen had dropped from his fingers, blotting the last
sentences written upon the manuscript of his great
speech&mdash;for Senator Newton still adhered to the ancient
fashion of recording thought. The blotted sentences were
these:</p>

<p>"The logic of events compels us to acknowledge the political
equality of those Asiatic invaders&mdash;shall I say
conquerors?&mdash;of our Indo-European institutions. But the
logic of events is often repugnant to common sense, and its
conclusions abhorrent to patriotism and right. The sword has
opened for them the way to the ballot box; but, Mr. President,
and I say it deliberately, no power under heaven can unlock for
these aliens the sacred approaches to our homes and hearts!"</p>

<p>Beside the senator stood Francesco, the professional dancer.
His face wore a smile of malicious triumph.</p>

<p>"With the Chinaman? Miss Newton&mdash;my daughter?" gasped the
senator. "I do not believe you. It is a lie."</p>

<p>"Then come to the Capitol, Your Excellency, and see it with
your own eyes," said the Italian.</p>

<p>The door was quickly opened and Clara Newton entered the room,
followed by the Honorable Mr. Wanlee and his friend.</p>

<p>"There is no need of making that excursion, Papa," said the
girl. "You can see it with your own eyes here and now. Francesco,
leave the house!"</p>

<p>The senator bowed with forced politeness to Mr. Walsingbam
Brown. Of the presence of Wanlee he took not the slightest
notice.</p>

<p>Senator Newton attempted to laugh. "This is a pleasantry,
Clara," he said; "a practical jest, designed by yourself and Mr.
Brown for my midnight diversion. It is a trifle
unseasonable."</p>

<p>"It is no jest," replied his daughter, bravely. She then went
up to Wanlee and took his hand in hers. "Papa," she said, "this
is a gentleman of whom you already know something. He is our
equal in station, in intellect, and in moral worth. He is in
every way worthy of my friendship and your esteem. Will you
listen to what he has to say to you? Will you, Papa?"</p>

<p>The senator laughed a short, hard laugh, and turned to Mr.
Walsingham Brown. "I have no communication to make to the member
of the lower branch," said he. "Why should he have any
communication to make to me?"</p>

<p>Miss Newton put her arm around the waist of the young Chinaman
and led him squarely in front of her father. "Because," she said,
in a voice as firm and clear as the note of a silver bell
"&mdash;because I love him."</p>

<p>In recalling with Wanlee the circumstances of this interview,
Mr. Walsingham Brown said long afterward, "She glowed for a
moment like the platinum of your thermo-electrode."</p>

<p>"If the member from California," said Senator Newton, without
changing the tone of his voice, and still continuing to address
himself to Mr. Brown, "has worked upon the sentimentality of this
foolish child, that is her misfortune, and mine. It cannot be
helped now. But if the member from California presumes to hope to
profit in the least by his sinister operations, or to enjoy
further opportunities for pursuing them, the member from
California deceives himself."</p>

<p>So saying he turned around in his chair and began to write on
his great speech.</p>

<p>"I come," said Wanlee slowly, now speaking for the first time,
"as an honorable man to ask of Senator Newton the hand of his
daughter in honorable marriage. Her own consent has already been
given."</p>

<p>"I have nothing further to say," said the Senator, once more
turning his cold face toward Mr. Brown. Then he paused an
instant, and added with a sting, "I am told that the member from
California is a prophet and apostle of Vegetable Rights. Let him
seek a cactus in marriage. He should wed on his own level."</p>

<p>Wanlee, coloring at the wanton insult, was about to leave the
room. A quick sign from Miss Newton arrested him.</p>

<p>"But I have something further to say," she cried with spirit.
"Listen, Father; it is this. If Mr. Wanlee goes out of the house
without a word from you&mdash;a word such as is due him from you
as a gentleman and as my father&mdash;I go with him to be his
wife before the sun rises!"</p>

<p>"Go if you will, girl," the senator coldly replied. "But first
consult with Mr. Walsingham Brown, who is a lawyer and a
gentleman, as to the tenor and effect of the Suspended Animation
Act."</p>

<p>Miss Newton looked inquiringly from one face to another. The
words had no meaning to her. Her lover turned suddenly pale and
clutched at the back of a chair for support. Mr. Brown's cheeks
were also white. He stepped quickly forward, holding out his
hands as if to avert some dreadful calamity.</p>

<p>"Surely you would not&mdash;" he began. "But no! That is an
absolute low, an inhuman, outrageous enactment that has long been
as dead as the partisan fury that prompted it. For a quarter of a
century it has been a dead letter on the statute books."</p>

<p>"I was not aware," said the senator, from between firmly set
teeth, "that the act had ever been repealed."</p>

<p>He took from the shelf a volume of statutes and opened the
book. "I will read the text," he said. "It will form an
appropriate part of the ritual of this marriage." He read as
follows:</p>

<p>"Section 7.391. No male person of Caucasian descent, of or
under the age of 25 years, shall marry, or promise or contract
himself in marriage with any female person of Mongolian descent
without the full written consent of his male parent or guardian,
as provided by law; and no female person, either maid or widow,
under the age of 30 years, of Caucasian parentage, shall give,
promise, or contract herself in marriage with any male person of
Mongolian descent without the full written and registered consent
of her male and female parents or guardians, as provided by law.
And any marriage obligations so contracted shall be null and
void, and the Caucasian so contracting shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and liable to punishment at the discretion of his or
her male parent or guardian as provided by law.</p>

<p>"Section 7.392. Such parents or guardians may, at their
discretion and upon application to the authorities of the United
States District Court for the district within which the offense
is committed, deliver the offending person of Caucasian descent
to the designated officers, and require that his or her
consciousness, bodily activities, and vital functions be
suspended by the frigorific process known as the Werkomer
process, for a period equal to that which must elapse before the
offending person will arrive at the age of 25 years, if a male,
or 30 years, if a female; or for a shorter period at the
discretion of the parent or guardian; said shorter period to be
fixed in advance."</p>

<p>"What does it mean?" demanded Miss Newton, bewildered by the
verbiage of the act, and alarmed by her lover's exclamation of
despair.</p>

<p>Mr. Walsingbam Brown shook his head, sadly. "It means," said
he, "that the cruel sin of the fathers is to be visited upon the
children."</p>

<p>"It means, Clara," said Wanlee with a great effort, "that we
must part."</p>

<p>"Understand me, Mr. Brown," said the senator, rising and
motioning impatiently with the hand that held the pen, as if to
dismiss both the subject and the intruding party. "I do not
employ the Suspended Animation Act as a bugaboo to frighten a
silly girl out of her lamentable infatuation. As surely as the
law stands, so surely will I put it to use."</p>

<p>Miss Newton gave her father a long, steady look which neither
Wanlee nor Mr. Brown could interpret and then slowly led the way
to the parlor. She closed the door and locked it. The clock on
the mantel said four.</p>

<p>A complete change had come over the girl's manner. The spirit
of defiance, of passionate appeal, of outspoken love, had gone.
She was calm now, as cold and self-possessed as the senator
himself. "Frozen!" she kept saying under her breath. "He has
frozen me already with his frigid heart."</p>

<p>She quickly asked Mr. Walsingham Brown to explain clearly the
force and bearings of the statute which her father had read from
the book. When he had done so, she inquired, "Is there not also a
law providing for voluntary suspension of animation?"</p>

<p>"The Twenty-seventh Amendment to the Constitution," replied
the lawyer, "recognizes the right of any individual, not
satisfied with the condition of his life, to suspend that life
for a time, long or short, according to his pleasure. But it is
rarely, as you know, that anyone avails himself of the
right&mdash;practically never, except as the only means to
procure divorce from uncongenial marriage relations."</p>

<p>"Still," she persisted, "the right exists and the way is
open?" He bowed. She went to Wanlee and said:</p>

<p>"My darling, it must be so. I must leave you for a time, but
as your wife. We will arrange a wedding"&mdash;and she smiled
sadly&mdash;"within this hour. Mr. Brown will go with us to the
clergyman. Then we will proceed at once to the Refuge, and you
yourself shall lead me to the cloister that is to keep me safe
till times are better for us. No, do not be startled, my love!
The resolution is taken; you cannot alter it. And it will not be
so very long, dear. Once, by accident, in arranging my father's
papers, I came across his Life Probabilities, drawn up by the
Vital Bureau at Washington. He has less than ten years to live. I
never thought to calculate in cold blood on the chances of my
father's life, but it must be. In ten years, Daniel, you may come
to the Refuge again and claim your bride. You will find me as you
left me."</p>

<p>With tears streaming down his pale cheeks, the Mongolian
strove to dissuade the Caucasian from her purpose. Hardly less
affected, Mr. Walsingham Brown joined his entreaties and
arguments.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen," he asked, "a woman who has undergone
what you propose to undergo? She went into the Refuge, perhaps,
as you will go, fresh, rosy, beautiful, full of life and energy.
She comes out a prematurely aged, withered, sallow, flaccid body,
a living corpse&mdash;a skeleton, a ghost of her former self.
In spite of all they say, there can be no absolute suspension of
animation. Absolute suspension would be death. Even in the case
of the most perfect freezing there is still some activity of the
vital functions, and they gnaw and prey upon the existence of the
unconscious subject. Will you risk," he suddenly demanded, using
the last and most perfect argument that can be addressed to a
woman "&mdash;will you risk the effect your loss of beauty may
have upon Wanlee's love after ten years' separation?"</p>

<p>Clara Newton was smiling now. "For my poor beauty," she
replied, "I care very little. Yet perhaps even that may be
preserved."</p>

<p>She took from the bosom of her dress the little gold box which
the Chinaman had given her in the supper room of the Capitol, and
hastily swallowed its entire contents.</p>

<p>Wanlee now spoke with determination: "Since you have resolved
to sacrifice ten years of your life my duty is with you. I shall
share with you the sacrifice and share also the joy of
awakening."</p>

<p>She gravely shook her head. "It is no sacrifice for me," she
said. "But you must remain in life. You have a great and noble
work to perform. Till the oppressed of the lower orders of being
are emancipated from man's injustice and cruelty, you cannot
abandon their cause. I think your duty is plain."</p>

<p>"You are right," he said, bowing his head to his breast.</p>

<p>In the gray dawn of the early morning the officials at the
Frigorific Refuge in Cambridgeport were astonished by the arrival
of a bridal party. The bridegroom's haggard countenance
contrasted strangely with the elegance of his full evening
toilet, and the bright scarlet bows at his knees seemed a mockery
of grief. The bride, in white satin, wore a placid smile on her
lovely face. The friend accompanying the two was grave and
silent.</p>

<p>Without delay the necessary papers of admission were drawn up
and signed and the proper registration was made upon the books of
the establishment. For an instant husband and wife rested in each
other's arms. Then she, still cheerful, followed the attendants
toward the inner door, while he, pressing both hands upon his
tearless eyes, turned away sobbing.</p>

<p>A moment later the intense cold of the congealing chamber
caught the bride and wrapped her close in its icy embrace.</p>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>06. &mdash; THE CRYSTAL MAN</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 30 January 1881</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
RAPIDLY turning into the Fifth Avenue from one of the cross
streets above the old reservoir, at quarter past eleven o'clock
on the night of November 6, 1879, I ran plump into an individual
coming the other way.</p>

<p>It was very dark on this corner. I could see nothing of the
person with whom I had the honor to be in collision.
Nevertheless, the quick habit of a mind accustomed to induction
had furnished me with several well-defined facts regarding him
before I fairly recovered from the shock of the encounter.</p>

<p>These were some of the facts: He was a heavier man than
myself, and stiffer in the legs; but he lacked precisely three
inches and a half of my stature. He wore a silk hat, a cape or
cloak of heavy woolen material, and rubber overshoes or arctics.
He was about thirty-five years old, born in America, educated at
a German university, either Heidelberg or Freiburg, naturally of
hasty temper, but considerate and courteous, in his demeanor to
others. He was not entirely at peace with society: there was
something in his life or in his present errand which he desired
to conceal.</p>

<p>How did I know all this when I had not seen the stranger, and
when only a single monosyllable had escaped his lips? Well, I
knew that he was stouter than myself, and firmer on his foot,
because it was I, not he, who recoiled. I knew that I was just
three inches and a half taller than he, for the tip of my nose
was still tingling from its contact with the stiff, sharp brim of
his hat. My hand, involuntarily raised, had come under the edge
of his cape. He wore rubber shoes, for I had not heard a
footfall. To an observant ear; the indications of age are as
plain in the tones of the voice as to the eye in the lines of the
countenance. In the first moment of exasperation of my
maladroitness, he had muttered "Ox!" a term that would occur to
nobody except a German at such a time. The pronunciation of the
guttural, however, told me that the speaker was an American
German, not a German American, and that his German education had
been derived south of the river Main. Moreover, the tone of the
gentleman and scholar was manifest even in the utterance of
wrath. That the gentleman was in no particular hurry, but for
some reason anxious to remain unknown; was a conclusion drawn
from the fact that, after listening in silence to my polite
apology, he stooped to recover and restore to me my umbrella, and
then passed on as noiselessly as he had approached.</p>

<p>I make it a point to verify my conclusions when possible. So I
turned back into the cross street and followed the stranger
toward a lamp part way down the block. Certainly, I was not more
than five seconds behind him. There was no other road that he
could have taken. No house door had opened and closed along the
way. And yet, when we came into the light, the form that ought to
have been directly in front of me did not appear. Neither man nor
man's shadow was visible.</p>

<p>Hurrying on as fast as I could walk to the next gaslight, I
paused under the lamp and listened. The street was apparently
deserted. The rays from the yellow flame reached only a little
way into the darkness. The steps and doorway, however, of the
brownstone house facing the street lamp were sufficiently
illuminated. The gilt figures above the door were distinct. I
recognized the house: the number was a familiar one. While I
stood under the gaslight, waiting, I heard a slight noise on
these steps, and the click of a key in a lock. The vestibule door
of the house was slowly opened, and then closed with a slam that
echoed across the street. Almost immediately followed the sound
of the opening and shutting of the inner door. Nobody had come
out. As far as my eyes could be trusted to report an event hardly
ten feet away and in broad light, nobody had gone in.</p>

<p>With a notion that here was scanty material for an exact
application of the inductive process, I stood a long time wildly
guessing at the philosophy of the strange occurrence. I felt that
vague sense of the unexplainable which amounts almost to dread.
It was a relief to hear steps on the sidewalk opposite, and
turning, to see a policeman swinging his long black club and
watching me.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
THIS house of chocolate brown, whose front door opened and
shut at midnight without indications of human agency, was, as I
have said, well known to me. I had left it not more than ten
minutes earlier, after spending the evening with my friend Bliss
and his daughter Pandora. The house was of the sort in which each
story constitutes a domicile complete in itself. The second
floor, or flat, had been inhabited by Bliss since his return from
abroad; that is to say, for a twelvemonth. I held Bliss in esteem
for his excellent qualities of heart, while his deplorably
illogical and unscientific mind commanded my profound pity. I
adored Pandora.</p>

<p>Be good enough to understand that my admiration for Pandora
Bliss was hopeless, and not only hopeless, but resigned to its
hopelessness. In our circle of acquaintance there was a tacit
covenant that the young lady's peculiar position as a flirt
wedded to a memory should be at all times respected. We adored
Pandora mildly, not passionately&mdash;just enough to feed her
coquetry without excoriating the seared surface of her widowed
heart. On her part, Pandora conducted herself with signal
propriety. She did not sigh too obtrusively when she flirted: and
she always kept her flirtations so well in hand that she could
cut them short whenever the fond, sad recollections came.</p>

<p>It was considered proper for us to tell Pandora that she owed
it to her youth and beauty to put aside the dead past like a
closed book, and to urge her respectfully to come forth into the
living present. It was not considered proper to press the subject
after she had once replied that this was forever impossible.</p>

<p>The particulars of the tragic episode in Miss Pandora's
European experience were not accurately known to us. It was
understood, in a vague way, that she had loved while abroad, and
trifled with her lover: that he had disappeared, leaving her in
ignorance of his fate and in perpetual remorse for her capricious
behavior. From Bliss I had gathered a few, sporadic facts, not
coherent enough to form a history of the case. There was no
reason to believe that Pandora's lover had committed suicide. His
name was Flack. He was a scientific man. In Bliss's opinion he
was a fool. In Bliss's opinion Pandora was a fool to pine on his
account. In Bliss's opinion all scientific men were more or less
fools.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THAT year I ate Thanksgiving dinner with the Blisses. In the
evening I sought to astonish the company by reciting the
mysterious events on the night of my collision with the stranger.
The story failed to produce the expected sensation. Two or three
odious people exchanged glances. Pandora, who was unusually
pensive, listened with seeming indifference. Her father, in his
stupid inability to grasp anything outside the commonplace,
laughed outright, and even went so far as to question my
trustworthiness as an observer of phenomena.</p>

<p>Somewhat nettled, and perhaps a little shaken in my own faith
in the marvel, I made an excuse to withdraw early. Pandora
accompanied me to the threshold. "Your story," said she,
"interested me strangely. I, too, could report occurrences in and
about this house which would surprise you. I believe I am not
wholly in the dark. The sorrowful past casts a glimmer of
light&mdash;but let us not be hasty. For my sake, probe the
matter to the bottom."</p>

<p>The young woman sighed as she bade me good night. I thought I
heard a second sigh, in a deeper tone than hers, and too distinct
to be a reverberation.</p>

<p>I began to go downstairs. Before I had descended half a dozen
steps I felt a man's hand laid rather heavily upon my shoulder
from behind. My first idea was that Bliss had followed me into
the hall to apologize for his rudeness. I turned around to meet
his friendly overture. Nobody was in sight.</p>

<p>Again the hand touched my arm. I shuddered in spite of my
philosophy.</p>

<p>This time the hand gently pulled at my coat sleeve, as if to
invite me upstairs. I ascended a step or two, and the pressure on
my arm was relaxed. I paused, and the silent invitation was
repeated with an urgency that left no doubt as to what was
wanted.</p>

<p>We mounted the stairs together, the presence leading the way,
I following. What an extraordinary journey it was! The halls were
bright with gaslight. By the testimony of my eyes there was no
one but myself upon the stairway. Closing my eyes, the illusion,
if illusion it could be called, was perfect. I could hear the
creaking of the stairs ahead of me, the soft but distinctly
audible footfalls synchronous with my own, even the regular
breathing of my companion and guide. Extending my arm, I could
touch and finger the skirt of his garment&mdash;a heavy woolen
cloak lined with silk.</p>

<p>Suddenly I opened my eyes. They told me again that I was
absolutely alone.</p>

<p>This problem then presented itself to mind: How to determine
whether vision was playing me false, while the senses of hearing
and feeling correctly informed me, or whether my ears and touch
lied, while my eyes reported the truth. Who shall be arbiter when
the senses contradict each other? The reasoning faculty? Reason
was inclined to recognize the presence of an intelligent being,
whose existence was flatly denied by the most trusted of the
senses.</p>

<p>We reached the topmost floor of the house. The door leading
out of the public hall opened for me, apparently of its own
accord. A curtain within seemed to draw itself aside, and hold
itself aside long enough to give me ingress to an apartment
wherein every appointment spoke of good taste and scholarly
habits. A wood fire was burning in the chimney place. The walls
were covered with books and pictures. The lounging chairs were
capacious and inviting. There was nothing in the room uncanny,
nothing weird, nothing different from the furniture of everyday
flesh and blood existence.</p>

<p>By this time I had cleared my mind of the last lingering
suspicion of the supernatural. These phenomena were perhaps not
inexplicable; all that I lacked was the key. The behavior of my
unseen host argued his amicable disposition. I was able to watch
with perfect calmness a series of manifestations of independent
energy on the part of inanimate objects.</p>

<p>In the first place, a great Turkish easy chair wheeled itself
out of a corner of the room and approached the hearth. Then a
square-backed Queen Anne chair started from another corner,
advancing until it was planted directly opposite the first. A
little tripod table lifted itself a few inches above the floor
and took a position between the two chairs. A thick octavo volume
backed out of its place on the shelf and sailed tranquilly
through the air at the height of three or four feet, landing
neatly on top of the table. A finely painted porcelain pipe left
a hook on the wall and joined the volume. A tobacco box jumped
from the mantlepiece. The door of a cabinet swung open, and a
decanter and wineglass made the journey in company, arriving
simultaneously at the same destination. Everything in the room
seemed instinct with the spirit of hospitality.</p>

<p>I seated myself in the easy chair, filled the wineglass,
lighted the pipe, and examined the volume. It was the <i>Handbuch
der Gewebelehre</i> of Bussius of Vienna. When I had replaced the
book upon the table, it deliberately opened itself at the four
hundred and forty-third page.</p>

<p>"You are not nervous?" demanded a voice, not four feet from my
tympanum.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
THIS voice had a familiar sound. I recognized it as the voice
that I heard in the street on the night of November 6, when it
called me an ox.</p>

<p>"No," I said. "I am not nervous. I am a man of science,
accustomed to regard all phenomena as explainable by natural
laws, provided we can discover the laws. No, I am not
frightened."</p>

<p>"So much the better. You are a man of science, like
myself"&mdash;here the voice groaned&mdash;"a man of nerve, and a
friend of Pandora's."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I interposed. "Since a lady's name is introduced
it would be well to know with whom or with what I am
speaking."</p>

<p>"That is precisely what I desire to communicate," replied the
voice, "before I ask you to render me a great service. My name is
or was Stephen Flack. I am or have been a citizen of the United
States. My exact status at present is as great a mystery to
myself as it can possibly be to you. But I am, or was, an honest
man and a gentleman, and I offer you my hand."</p>

<p>I saw no hand. I reached forth my own, however, and it met the
pressure of warm, living fingers.</p>

<p>"Now," resumed the voice, after this silent pact of
friendship, "be good enough to read the passage at which I have
opened the book upon the table."</p>

<p>Here is a rough translation of what I read in German:</p>

<p>As the color of the organic tissues constituting the body
depends upon the presence of certain proximate principles of the
third class, all containing iron as one of the ultimate elements,
it follows that the hue may vary according to well-defined
chemico-physiological changes. An excess of hematin in the blood
globules gives a ruddier tinge to every tissue. The melanin that
colors the choroid of the eye, the iris, the hair, may be
increased or diminished according to laws recently formulated by
Schardt of Basel. In the epidermis the excess of melanin makes
the Negro, the deficient supply the albino. The hematin and the
melanin, together with the greenish-yellow biliverdin and the
reddish-yellow uroxacin, are the pigments which impart color
character to tissues otherwise transparent, or nearly so. I
deplore my inability to record the result of some highly
interesting histological experiments conducted by that
indefatigable investigator Fröliker in achieving success in the
way of separating pink discoloration of the human body by
chemical means.</p>

<p>"For five years," continued my unseen companion when I had
finished reading, "I was Fröliker's student and laboratory
assistant at Freiburg. Bussius only half guessed at the
importance of our experiments. We reached results which were so
astounding that public policy required they should not be
published, even to the scientific world. Fröliker died a year ago
last August.</p>

<p>"I had faith in the genius of this great thinker and admirable
man. If he had rewarded my unquestioning loyalty with full
confidence, I should not now be a miserable wretch. But his
natural reserve, and the jealousy with which all savants guard
their unverified results, kept me ignorant of the essential
formulas governing our experiments. As his disciple I was
familiar with the laboratory details of the work; the master
alone possessed the radical secret. The consequence is that I
have been led into a misfortune more appalling than has been the
lot of any human being since the primal curse fell upon Cain.</p>

<p>"Our efforts were at first directed to the enlargement and
variation of the quantity of pigmentary matter in the system. By
increasing the proportion of melanin, for instance, conveyed in
food to the blood, we were able to make a fair man dark, a dark
man black as an African. There was scarcely a hue we could not
impart to the skin by modifying and varying our combinations. The
experiments were usually tried on me. At different times I have
been copper-colored, violet blue, crimson, and chrome yellow. For
one triumphant week I exhibited in my person all the colors of
the rainbow. There still remains a witness to the interesting
character of our work during this period."</p>

<p>The voice paused, and in a few seconds a hand bell upon the
mantel was sounded. Presently an old man with a close-fitting
skullcap shuffled into the room.</p>

<p>"Käspar," said the voice, in German, "show the gentleman your
hair."</p>

<p>Without manifesting any surprise, and as if perfectly
accustomed to receive commands addressed to him out of vacancy,
the old domestic bowed and removed his cap. The scanty locks thus
discovered were of a lustrous emerald green. I expressed my
astonishment.</p>

<p>"The gentleman finds your hair very beautiful," said the
voice, again in German. "That is all, Käspar."</p>

<p>Replacing his cap, the domestic withdrew, with a look of
gratified vanity on his face.</p>

<p>"Old Käspar was Fröliker's servant, and is now mine. He was
the subject of one of our first applications of the process. The
worthy man was so pleased with the result that he would never
permit us to restore his hair to its original red. He is a
faithful soul, and my only intermediary and representative in the
visible world.</p>

<p>"Now," continued Flack, "to the story of my undoing. The great
histologist with whom it was my privilege to be associated, next
turned his attention to another and still more interesting branch
of the investigation. Hitherto he had sought merely to increase
or to modify the pigments in the tissues. He now began a series
of experiments as to the possibility of eliminating those
pigments altogether from the system by absorption, exudation, and
the use of the chlorides and other chemical agents acting on
organic matter. He was only too successful!</p>

<p>"Again I was the subject of experiments which Fröliker
supervised, imparting to me only so much of the secret of this
process as was unavoidable. For weeks at a time I remained in his
private laboratory, seeing no one and seen by no one excepting
the professor and the trustworthy Käspar. Herr Fröliker proceeded
with caution, closely watching the effect of each new test, and
advancing by degrees. He never went so far in one experiment that
he was unable to withdraw at discretion. He always kept open an
easy road for retreat. For that reason I felt myself perfectly
safe in his hands and submitted to whatever he required.</p>

<p>"Under the action of the etiolating drugs which the professor
administered in connection with powerful detergents, I became at
first pale, white, colorless as an albino, but without suffering
in general health. My hair and beard looked like spun glass and
my skin like marble. The professor was satisfied with his
results, and went no further at this time. He restored to me my
normal color.</p>

<p>"In the next experiment, and in those succeeding, he allowed
his chemical agents to take firmer hold upon the tissues of my
body. I became not only white, like a bleached man, but slightly
translucent, like a porcelain figure. Then again he paused for a
while, giving me back my color and allowing me to go forth into
the world. Two months later I was more than translucent. You have
seen floating those sea radiates, the medusa or jellyfish, their
outlines almost invisible to the eye. Well, I became in the air
like a jellyfish in the water. Almost perfectly transparent, it
was only by close inspection that old Käspar could discover my
whereabouts in the room when he came to bring me food. It was
Käspar who ministered to my wants at times when I was
cloistered."</p>

<p>"But your clothing?" I inquired, interrupting Flack's
narrative. "That must have stood out in strong contrast with the
dim aspect of your body."</p>

<p>"Ah, no," said Flack. "The spectacle of an apparently empty
suit of clothes moving about the laboratory was too grotesque
even for the grave professor. For the protection of his gravity
he was obliged to devise a way to apply his process to dead
organic matter, such as the wool of my cloak, the cotton of my
shirts, and the leather of my shoes. Thus I came to be equipped
with the outfit which still serves me.</p>

<p>"It was at this stage of our progress, when we had almost
attained perfect transparency, and therefore complete
invisibility, that I met Pandora Bliss.</p>

<p>"A year ago last July, in one of the intervals of our
experimenting, and at a time when I presented my natural
appearance, I went into the Schwarzwald to recuperate. I first
saw and admired Pandora at the little village of St. Blasien.
They had come from the Falls of the Rhine, and were traveling
north; I turned around and traveled north. At the Stern Inn I
loved Pandora; at the summit of the Feldberg I madly worshiped
her. In the Höllenpass I was ready to sacrifice my life for a
gracious word from her lips. On Hornisgrinde I besought her
permission to throw myself from the top of the mountain into the
gloomy waters of the Mummelsee in order to prove my devotion. You
know Pandora. Since you know her, there is no need to apologize
for the rapid growth of my infatuation. She flirted with me,
laughed with me, laughed at me, drove with me, walked with me
through byways in the green woods, climbed with me up acclivities
so steep that climbing together was one delicious, prolonged
embrace; talked science with me, and sentiment; listened to my
hopes and enthusiasm, snubbed me, froze me, maddened me&mdash;all
at her sweet will, and all while her matter-of-fact papa dozed in
the coffee rooms of the inns over the financial columns of the
latest New York newspapers. But whether she loved me I know not
to this day.</p>

<p>"When Pandora's father learned what my pursuits were, and what
my prospects, he brought our little idyll to an abrupt
termination. I think he classed me somewhere between the
professional jugglers and the quack doctors. In vain I explained
to him that I should be famous and probably rich. 'When you are
famous and rich,' he remarked with a grin, 'I shall be pleased to
see you at my office in Broad street' He carried Pandora off to
Paris, and I returned to Freiburg.</p>

<p>"A few weeks later, one bright afternoon in August, I stood in
Fröliker's laboratory unseen by four persons who were almost
within the radius of my arm's length. Käspar was behind me,
washing some test tubes. Fröliker, with a proud smile upon his
face, was gazing intently at the place where he knew I ought to
be. Two brother professors, summoned on some pretext, were
unconsciously almost jostling me with their elbows as they
discussed I know not what trivial question. They could have heard
my heart beat. 'By the way, Herr Professor,' one asked as he was
about to depart, 'has your assistant, Herr Flack, returned from
his vacation?' This test was perfect.</p>

<p>"As soon as we were alone, Professor Fröliker grasped my
invisible hand, as you have grasped it tonight. He was in high
spirits.</p>

<p>"'My dear fellow,' he said, 'tomorrow crowns our work. You
shall appear&mdash;or rather not appear&mdash;before the
assembled faculty of the university. I have telegraphed
invitations to Heidelberg, to Bonn, to Berlin. Schrotter,
Haeckel, Steinmetz, Lavallo, will be here. Our triumph will be in
presence of the most eminent physicists of the age. I shall then
disclose those secrets of our process which I have hitherto
withheld even from you, my co-laborer and trusted friend. But you
shall share the glory. What is this I hear about the forest bird
that has flown? My boy, you shall be restocked with pigment and
go to Paris to seek her with fame in your hands and the blessings
of science on your head.'</p>

<p>"The next morning, the nineteenth of August, before I had
arisen from my cot bed, Käspar hastily entered the
laboratory.</p>

<p>"'Herr Flack! Herr Flack!' he gasped, 'the Herr Doctor
Professor is dead of apoplexy.'"</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">
THE narrative had come to an end. I sat a long time thinking.
What could I do? What could I say? In what shape could I offer
consolation to this unhappy man?</p>

<p>Flack, the invisible, was sobbing bitterly.</p>

<p>He was the first to speak. "It is hard, hard, hard! For no
crime in the eyes of man, for no sin in the sight of God, I have
been condemned to a fate ten thousand times worse than hell. I
must walk the earth, a man, living, seeing, loving, like other
men, while between me and all that makes life worth having there
is a barrier fixed forever. Even ghosts have shapes. My life is
living death; my existence oblivion. No friend can look me in the
face. Were I to clasp to my breast the woman I love, it would
only be to inspire terror inexpressible. I see her almost every
day. I brush against her skirts as I pass her on the stairs. Did
she love me? Does she love me? Would not that knowledge make the
curse still more cruel? Yet it was to learn the truth that I
brought you here."</p>

<p>Then I made the greatest mistake of my life.</p>

<p>"Cheer up!" I said. "Pandora has always loved you."</p>

<p>By the sudden overturning of the table I knew with what
vehemence Flack sprang to his feet. His two hands had my
shoulders in a fierce grip.</p>

<p>"Yes," I continued; "Pandora has been faithful to your memory.
There is no reason to despair. The secret of Fröliker's process
died with him, but why should it not be rediscovered by
experiment and induction <i>ab initio</i>, with the aid which you
can render? Have courage and hope. She loves you. In five minutes
you shall hear it from her own lips."</p>

<p>No wail of pain that I ever heard was half so pathetic as his
wild cry of joy.</p>

<p>I hurried downstairs and summoned Miss Bliss into the hall. In
a few words I explained the situation. To my surprise, she
neither fainted nor went into hysterics. "Certainly, I will
accompany you," she said, with a smile which I could not then
interpret.</p>

<p>She followed me into Flack's room, calmly scrutinizing every
corner of the apartment, with the set smile still upon her face.
Had she been entering a ballroom she could not have shown greater
self-possession. She manifested no astonishment, no terror, when
her hand was seized by invisible hands and covered with kisses
from invisible lips. She listened with composure to the torrent
of loving and caressing words which my unfortunate friend poured
into her ears.</p>

<p>Perplexed and uneasy, I watched the strange scene.</p>

<p>Presently Miss Bliss withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>"Really, Mr. Flack," she said with a light laugh, "you are
sufficiently demonstrative. Did you acquire the habit on the
Continent?"</p>

<p>"Pandora!" I heard him say, "I do not understand."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," she calmly went on, "you regard it as one of the
privileges of your invisibility. Let me congratulate you on the
success of your experiment. What a clever man your
professor&mdash;what is his name?&mdash;must be. You can make a
fortune by exhibiting yourself."</p>

<p>Was this the woman who for months had paraded her inconsolable
sorrow for the loss of this very man? I was stupefied. Who shall
undertake to analyze the motives of a coquette? What science is
profound enough to unravel her unconscionable whims?</p>

<p>"Pandora!" he exclaimed again, in a bewildered voice. "What
does it mean? Why do you receive me in this manner? Is that all
you have to say to me?"</p>

<p>"I believe that is all," she coolly replied, moving toward the
door. "You are a gentleman, and I need not ask you to spare me
any further annoyance."</p>

<p>"Your heart is quartz," I whispered, as she passed me in going
out. "You are unworthy of him."</p>

<p>Flack's despairing cry brought Käspar into the room. With the
instinct acquired by long and faithful service, the old man went
straight to the place where his master was. I saw him clutch at
the air, as if struggling with and seeking to detain the
invisible man. He was flung violently aside. He recovered himself
and stood an instant listening, his neck distended, his face
pale. Then he rushed out of the door and down the stairs. I
followed him.</p>

<p>The street door of the house was open. On the sidewalk Käspar
hesitated a few seconds. It was toward the west that he finally
turned, running down the street with such speed that I had the
utmost difficulty to keep at his side.</p>

<p>It was near midnight. We crossed avenue after avenue. An
inarticulate murmur of satisfaction escaped old Käspar's lips. A
little way ahead of us we saw a man, standing at one of the
avenue corners, suddenly thrown to the ground. We sped on, never
relaxing our pace. I now heard rapid footfalls a short distance
in advance of us. I clutched Käspar's arm. He nodded.</p>

<p>Almost breathless, I was conscious that we were no longer
treading upon pavement, but on boards and amid a confusion of
lumber. In front of us were no more lights; only blank vacancy.
Käspar gave one mighty spring. He clutched, missed, and fell back
with a cry of horror.</p>

<p>There was a dull splash in the black waters of the river at
our feet.</p>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>07. &mdash; THE CLOCK THAT WENT BACKWARD</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 18 September 1881</h3>

<p class="first">
A ROW of Lombardy poplars stood in front of my great-aunt
Gertrude's house, on the bank of the Sheepscot River. In personal
appearance my aunt was surprisingly like one of those trees. She
had the look of hopeless anemia that distinguishes them from
fuller blooded sorts. She was tall, severe in outline, and
extremely thin. Her habiliments clung to her. I am sure that had
the gods found occasion to impose upon her the fate of Daphne she
would have taken her place easily and naturally in the dismal
row, as melancholy a poplar as the rest.</p>

<p>Some of my earliest recollections are of this venerable
relative. Alive and dead she bore an important part in the events
I am about to recount: events which I believe to be without
parallel in the experience of mankind.</p>

<p>During our periodical visits of duty to Aunt Gertrude in
Maine, my cousin Harry and myself were accustomed to speculate
much on her age. Was she sixty, or was she six score? We had no
precise information; she might have been either. The old lady was
surrounded by old-fashioned things. She seemed to live altogether
in the past. In her short half-hours of communicativeness, over
her second cup of tea, or on the piazza where the poplars sent
slim shadows directly toward the east, she used to tell us
stories of her alleged ancestors. I say alleged, because we never
fully believed that she had ancestors.</p>

<p>A genealogy is a stupid thing. Here is Aunt Gertrude's,
reduced to its simplest forms:</p>

<p>Her great-great-grandmother (1599-1642) was a woman of Holland
who married a Puritan refugee, and sailed from Leyden to Plymouth
in the ship Ann in the year of our Lord 1632. This Pilgrim mother
had a daughter, Aunt Gertrude's great-grandmother (1640-1718).
She came to the Eastern District of Massachusetts in the early
part of the last century, and was carried off by the Indians in
the Penobscot wars. Her daughter (1680-1776) lived to see these
colonies free and independent, and contributed to the population
of the coming republic not less than nineteen stalwart sons and
comely daughters. One of the latter (1735-1802) married a
Wiscasset skipper engaged in the West India trade, with whom she
sailed. She was twice wrecked at sea&mdash;once on what is now
Seguin Island and once on San Salvador. It was on San Salvador
that Aunt Gertrude was born.</p>

<p>We got to be very tired of hearing this family history.
Perhaps it was the constant repetition and the merciless
persistency with which the above dates were driven into our young
ears that made us skeptics. As I have said, we took little stock
in Aunt Gertrude's ancestors. They seemed highly improbable. In
our private opinion the great-grandmothers and grandmothers and
so forth were pure myths, and Aunt Gertrude herself was the
principal in all the adventures attributed to them, having lasted
from century to century while generations of contemporaries went
the way of all flesh.</p>

<p>On the first landing of the square stairway of the mansion
loomed a tall Dutch clock. The case was more than eight feet
high, of a dark red wood, not mahogany, and it was curiously
inlaid with silver. No common piece of furniture was this. About
a hundred years ago there flourished in the town of Brunswick a
horologist named Cary, an industrious and accomplished workman.
Few well-to-do houses on that part of the coast lacked a Cary
timepiece. But Aunt Gertrude's clock had marked the hours and
minutes of two full centuries before the Brunswick artisan was
born. It was running when William the Taciturn pierced the dikes
to relieve Leyden. The name of the maker, Jan Lipperdam, and the
date, 1572, were still legible in broad black letters and figures
reaching quite across the dial. Cary's masterpieces were plebeian
and recent beside this ancient aristocrat. The jolly Dutch moon,
made to exhibit the phases over a landscape of windmills and
polders, was cunningly painted. A skilled hand had carved the
grim ornament at the top, a death's head transfixed by a
two-edged sword. Like all timepieces of the sixteenth century, it
had no pendulum. A simple Van Wyck escapement governed the
descent of the weights to the bottom of the tall case.</p>

<p>But these weights never moved. Year after year, when Harry and
I returned to Maine, we found the hands of the old clock pointing
to the quarter past three, as they had pointed when we first saw
them. The fat moon hung perpetually in the third quarter, as
motionless as the death's head above. There was a mystery about
the silenced movement and the paralyzed hands. Aunt Gertrude told
us that the works had never performed their functions since a
bolt of lightning entered the clock; and she showed us a black
hole in the side of the case near the top, with a yawning rift
that extended downward for several feet. This explanation failed
to satisfy us. It did not account for the sharpness of her
refusal when we proposed to bring over the watchmaker from the
village, or for her singular agitation once when she found Harry
on a stepladder, with a borrowed key in his hand, about to test
for himself the clock's suspended vitality.</p>

<p>One August night, after we had grown out of boyhood, I was
awakened by a noise in the hallway. I shook my cousin.
"Somebody's in the house," I whispered.</p>

<p>We crept out of our room and on to the stairs. A dim light
came from below. We held breath and noiselessly descended to the
second landing. Harry clutched my arm. He pointed down over the
banisters, at the same time drawing me back into the shadow.</p>

<p>We saw a strange thing.</p>

<p>Aunt Gertrude stood on a chair in front of the old clock, as
spectral in her white nightgown and white nightcap as one of the
poplars when covered with snow. It chanced that the floor creaked
slightly under our feet. She turned with a sudden movement,
peering intently into the darkness, and holding a candle high
toward us, so that the light was full upon her pale face. She
looked many years older than when I bade her good night. For a
few minutes she was motionless, except in the trembling arm that
held aloft the candle. Then, evidently reassured, she placed the
light upon a shelf and turned again to the clock.</p>

<p>We now saw the old lady take a key from behind the face and
proceed to wind up the weights. We could hear her breath, quick
and short. She rested a hand on either side of the case and held
her face close to the dial, as if subjecting it to anxious
scrutiny. In this attitude she remained for a long time. We heard
her utter a sigh of relief, and she half turned toward us for a
moment. I shall never forget the expression of wild joy that
transfigured her features then.</p>

<p>The hands of the clock were moving; they were moving
backward.</p>

<p>Aunt Gertrude put both arms around the clock and pressed her
withered cheek against it. She kissed it repeatedly. She caressed
it in a hundred ways, as if it had been a living and beloved
thing. She fondled it and talked to it, using words which we
could hear but could not understand. The hands continued to move
backward.</p>

<p>Then she started back with a sudden cry. The clock had
stopped. We saw her tall body swaying for an instant on the
chair. She stretched out her arms in a convulsive gesture of
terror and despair, wrenched the minute hand to its old place at
a quarter past three, and fell heavily to the floor.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
AUNT GERTRUDE'S will left me her bank and gas stocks, real
estate, railroad bonds, and city sevens, and gave Harry the
clock. We thought at the time that this was a very unequal
division, the more surprising because my cousin had always seemed
to be the favorite. Half in seriousness we made a thorough
examination of the ancient timepiece, sounding its wooden case
for secret drawers, and even probing the not complicated works
with a knitting needle to ascertain if our whimsical relative had
bestowed there some codicil or other document changing the aspect
of affairs. We discovered nothing.</p>

<p>There was testamentary provision for our education at the
University of Leyden. We left the military school in which we had
learned a little of the theory of war, and a good deal of the art
of standing with our noses over our heels, and took ship without
delay. The clock went with us. Before many months it was
established in a corner of a room in the Breede Straat.</p>

<p>The fabric of Jan Lipperdam's ingenuity, thus restored to its
native air, continued to tell the hour of quarter past three with
its old fidelity. The author of the clock had been under the sod
for nearly three hundred years. The combined skill of his
successors in the craft at Leyden could make it go neither
forward nor backward.</p>

<p>We readily picked up enough Dutch to make ourselves understood
by the townspeople, the professors, and such of our eight hundred
and odd fellow students as came into intercourse. This language,
which looks so hard at first, is only a sort of polarized
English. Puzzle over it a little while and it jumps into your
comprehension like one of those simple cryptograms made by
running together all the words of a sentence and then dividing in
the wrong places.</p>

<p>The language acquired and the newness of our surroundings worn
off, we settled into tolerably regular pursuits. Harry devoted
himself with some assiduity to the study of sociology, with
especial reference to the round-faced and not unkind maidens of
Leyden. I went in for the higher metaphysics.</p>

<p>Outside of our respective studies, we had a common ground of
unfailing interest. To our astonishment, we found that not one in
twenty of the faculty or students knew or cared a sliver about
the glorious history of the town, or even about the circumstances
under which the university itself was founded by the Prince of
Orange. In marked contrast with the general indifference was the
enthusiasm of Professor Van Stopp, my chosen guide through the
cloudiness of speculative philosophy.</p>

<p>This distinguished Hegelian was a tobacco-dried little old
man, with a skullcap over features that reminded me strangely of
Aunt Gertrude's. Had he been her own brother the facial
resemblance could not have been closer. I told him so once, when
we were together in the Stadthuis looking at the portrait of the
hero of the siege, the Burgomaster Van der Werf. The professor
laughed. "I will show you what is even a more extraordinary
coincidence," said he; and, leading the way across the hall to
the great picture of the siege, by Warmers, he pointed out the
figure of a burgher participating in the defense. It was true.
Van Stopp might have been the burgher's son; the burgher might
have been Aunt Gertrude's father.</p>

<p>The professor seemed to be fond of us. We often went to his
rooms in an old house in the Rapenburg Straat, one of the few
houses remaining that antedate 1574. He would walk with us
through the beautiful suburbs of the city, over straight roads
lined with poplars that carried us back to the bank of the
Sheepscot in our minds. He took us to the top of the ruined Roman
tower in the center of the town, and from the same battlements
from which anxious eyes three centuries ago had watched the slow
approach of Admiral Boisot's fleet over the submerged polders, he
pointed out the great dike of the Landscheiding, which was cut
that the oceans might bring Boisot's Zealanders to raise the
leaguer [<i>siege</i>] and feed the starving. He showed us the
headquarters of the Spaniard Valdez at Leyderdorp, and told us
how heaven sent a violent northwest wind on the night of the
first of October, piling up the water deep where it had been
shallow and sweeping the fleet on between Zoeterwoude and Zwieten
up to the very walls of the fort at Lammen, the last stronghold
of the besiegers and the last obstacle in the way of succor to
the famishing inhabitants. Then he showed us where, on the very
night before the retreat of the besieging army, a huge breach was
made in the wall of Leyden, near the Cow Gate, by the Walloons
from Lammen.</p>

<p>"Why!" cried Harry, catching fire from the eloquence of the
professor's narrative, "that was the decisive moment of the
siege."</p>

<p>The professor said nothing. He stood with his arms folded,
looking intently into my cousin's eyes.</p>

<p>"For," continued Harry, "had that point not been watched, or
had defense failed and the breach been carried by the night
assault from Lammen, the town would have been burned and the
people massacred under the eyes of Admiral Boisot and the fleet
of relief. Who defended the breach?"</p>

<p>Van Stopp replied very slowly, as if weighing every word:</p>

<p>"History records the explosion of the mine under the city wall
on the last night of the siege; it does not tell the story of the
defense or give the defender's name. Yet no man that ever lived
had a more tremendous charge than fate entrusted to this unknown
hero. Was it chance that sent him to meet that unexpected danger?
Consider some of the consequences had he failed. The fall of
Leyden would have destroyed the last hope of the Prince of Orange
and of the free states. The tyranny of Philip would have been
reestablished. The birth of religious liberty and of
self-government by the people would have been postponed, who
knows for how many centuries? Who knows that there would or could
have been a republic of the United States of America had there
been no United Netherlands? Our University, which has given to
the world Grotius, Scaliger, Arminius, and Descartes, was founded
upon this hero's successful defense of the breach. We owe to him
our presence here today. Nay, you owe to him your very existence.
Your ancestors were of Leyden; between their lives and the
butchers outside the walls he stood that night."</p>

<p>The little professor towered before us, a giant of enthusiasm
and patriotism. Harry's eyes glistened and his cheeks
reddened.</p>

<p>"Go home, boys," said Van Stopp, "and thank God that while the
burghers of Leyden were straining their gaze toward Zoeterwoude
and the fleet, there was one pair of vigilant eyes and one stout
heart at the town wall just beyond the Cow Gate!"</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
THE rain was splashing against the windows one evening in the
autumn of our third year at Leyden, when Professor Van Stopp
honored us with a visit in the Breede Straat. Never had I seen
the old gentleman in such spirits. He talked incessantly. The
gossip of the town, the news of Europe, science, poetry,
philosophy, were in turn touched upon and treated with the same
high and good humor. I sought to draw him out on Hegel, with
whose chapter on the complexity and interdependency of things I
was just then struggling.</p>

<p>"You do not grasp the return of the Itself into Itself through
its Otherself?" he said smiling. "Well, you will, sometime."</p>

<p>Harry was silent and preoccupied. His taciturnity gradually
affected even the professor. The conversation flagged, and we sat
a long while without a word. Now and then there was a flash of
lightning succeeded by distant thunder.</p>

<p>"Your clock does not go," suddenly remarked the professor.
"Does it ever go?"</p>

<p>"Never since we can remember," I replied. "That is, only once,
and then it went backward. It was when Aunt Gertrude&mdash;"</p>

<p>Here I caught a warning glance from Harry. I laughed and
stammered, "The clock is old and useless. It cannot be made to
go."</p>

<p>"Only backward?" said the professor, calmly, and not appearing
to notice my embarrassment. "Well, and why should not a clock go
backward? Why should not Time itself turn and retrace its
course?"</p>

<p>He seemed to be waiting for an answer. I had none to give.</p>

<p>"I thought you Hegelian enough," he continued, "to admit that
every condition includes its own contradiction. Time is a
condition, not an essential. Viewed from the Absolute, the
sequence by which future follows present and present follows past
is purely arbitrary. Yesterday, today, tomorrow; there is no
reason in the nature of things why the order should not be
tomorrow, today, yesterday."</p>

<p>A sharper peal of thunder interrupted the professor's
speculations.</p>

<p>"The day is made by the planet's revolution on its axis from
west to east. I fancy you can conceive conditions under which it
might turn from east to west, unwinding, as it were, the
revolutions of past ages. Is it so much more difficult to imagine
Time unwinding itself; Time on the ebb, instead of on the flow;
the past unfolding as the future recedes; the centuries
countermarching; the course of events proceeding toward the
Beginning and not, as now, toward the End?"</p>

<p>"But," I interposed, "we know that as far as we are concerned
the&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We know!" exclaimed Van Stopp, with growing scorn. "Your
intelligence has no wings. You follow in the trail of Compte and
his slimy brood of creepers and crawlers. You speak with amazing
assurance of your position in the universe. You seem to think
that your wretched little individuality has a firm foothold in
the Absolute. Yet you go to bed tonight and dream into existence
men, women, children, beasts of the past or of the future. How do
you know that at this moment you yourself, with all your conceit
of nineteenth-century thought, are anything more than a creature
of a dream of the future, dreamed, let us say, by some
philosopher of the sixteenth century? How do you know that you
are anything more than a creature of a dream of the past, dreamed
by some Hegelian of the twenty-sixth century? How do you know,
boy, that you will not vanish into the sixteenth century or 2060
the moment the dreamer awakes?"</p>

<p>There was no replying to this, for it was sound metaphysics.
Harry yawned. I got up and went to the window. Professor Van
Stopp approached the clock.</p>

<p>"Ah, my children," said he, "there is no fixed progress of
human events. Past, present, and future are woven together in one
inextricable mesh. Who shall say that this old clock is not right
to go backward?"</p>

<p>A crash of thunder shook the house. The storm was over our
heads.</p>

<p>When the blinding glare had passed away, Professor Van Stopp
was standing upon a chair before the tall timepiece. His face
looked more than ever like Aunt Gertrude's. He stood as she had
stood in that last quarter of an hour when we saw her wind the
clock.</p>

<p>The same thought struck Harry and myself.</p>

<p>"Hold!" we cried, as he began to wind the works. "It may be
death if you&mdash;"</p>

<p>The professor's sallow features shone with the strange
enthusiasm that had transformed Aunt Gertrude's.</p>

<p>"True," he said, "it may be death; but it may be the
awakening. Past, present, future; all woven together! The shuttle
goes to and fro, forward and back&mdash;"</p>

<p>He had wound the clock. The hands were whirling around the
dial from right to left with inconceivable rapidity. In this
whirl we ourselves seemed to be borne along. Eternities seemed to
contract into minutes while lifetimes were thrown off at every
tick. Van Stopp, both arms outstretched, was reeling in his
chair. The house shook again under a tremendous peal of thunder.
At the same instant a ball of fire, leaving a wake of sulphurous
vapor and filling the room with dazzling light, passed over our
heads and smote the clock. Van Stopp was prostrated. The hands
ceased to revolve.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p class="first">
THE roar of the thunder sounded like heavy cannonading. The
lightning's blaze appeared as the steady light of a
conflagration. With our hands over our eyes, Harry and I rushed
out into the night.</p>

<p>Under a red sky people were hurrying toward the Stadthuis.
Flames in the direction of the Roman tower told us that the heart
of the town was afire. The faces of those we saw were haggard and
emaciated. From every side we caught disjointed phrases of
complaint or despair. "Horseflesh at ten schillings the pound,"
said one, "and bread at sixteen schillings."</p>

<p>"Bread indeed!" an old woman retorted: "It's eight weeks
gone since I have seen a crumb."</p>

<p>"My little grandchild, the  lame one, went last night."</p>

<p>"Do you know what Gekke Betje, the washerwoman, did? She was
starving. Her babe died, and she and her man&mdash;"</p>

<p>A louder cannon burst cut short this revelation. We made our
way on toward the citadel of the town, passing a few soldiers
here and there and many burghers with grim faces under their
broad-brimmed felt hats.</p>

<p>"There is bread plenty yonder where the gunpowder is, and full
pardon, too. Valdez shot another amnesty over the walls this
morning."</p>

<p>An excited crowd immediately surrounded the speaker. "But the
fleet!" they cried.</p>

<p>"The fleet is grounded fast on the Greenway polder. Boisot may
turn his one eye seaward for a wind till famine and pestilence
have carried off every mother's son of ye, and his ark will not
be a rope's length nearer. Death by plague, death by starvation,
death by fire and musketry&mdash;that is what the burgomaster
offers us in return for glory for himself and kingdom for
Orange."</p>

<p>"He asks us," said a sturdy citizen, "to hold out only
twenty-four hours longer, and to pray meanwhile for an ocean
wind."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes!" sneered the first speaker. "Pray on. There is bread
enough locked in Pieter Adriaanszoon van der Werf's cellar. I
warrant you that is what gives him so wonderful a stomach for
resisting the Most Catholic King."</p>

<p>A young girl, with braided yellow hair, pressed through the
crowd and confronted the malcontent. "Good people," said the
maiden, "do not listen to him. He is a traitor with a Spanish
heart. I am Pieter's daughter. We have no bread. We ate malt
cakes and rape-seed like the rest of you till that was gone. Then
we stripped the green leaves from the lime trees and willows in
our garden and ate them. We have eaten even the thistles and
weeds that grew between the stones by the canal. The coward
lies."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the insinuation had its effect. The throng, now
become a mob, surged off in the direction of the burgomaster's
house. One ruffian raised his hand to strike the girl out of the
way. In a wink the cur was under the feet of his fellows, and
Harry, panting and glowing, stood at the maiden's side, shouting
defiance in good English at the backs of the rapidly retreating
crowd.</p>

<p>With the utmost frankness she put both her arms around Harry's
neck and kissed him.</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "You are a hearty lad. My name is
Gertruyd van der Wert."</p>

<p>Harry was fumbling in his vocabulary for the proper Dutch
phrases, but the girl would not stay for compliments. "They mean
mischief to my father;" and she hurried us through several
exceedingly narrow streets into a three-cornered market place
dominated by a church with two spires. "There he is," she
exclaimed, "on the steps of St. Pancras."</p>

<p>There was a tumult in the market place. The conflagration
raging beyond the church and the voices of the Spanish and
Walloon cannon outside of the walls were less angry than the roar
of this multitude of desperate men clamoring for the bread that a
single word from their leader's lips would bring them. "Surrender
to the King!" they cried, "or we will send your dead body to
Lammen as Leyden's token of submission."</p>

<p>One tall man, taller by half a head than any of the burghers
confronting him, and so dark of complexion that we wondered how
he could be the father of Gertruyd, heard the threat in silence.
When the burgomaster spoke, the mob listened in spite of
themselves.</p>

<p>"What is it you ask, my friends? That we break our vow and
surrender Leyden to the Spaniards? That is to devote ourselves to
a fate far more horrible than starvation. I have to keep the
oath! Kill me, if you will have it so. I can die only once,
whether by your hands, by the enemy's, or by the hand of God. Let
us starve, if we must, welcoming starvation because it comes
before dishonor. Your menaces do not move me; my life is at your
disposal. Here, take my sword, thrust it into my breast, and
divide my flesh among you to appease your hunger. So long as I
remain alive expect no surrender."</p>

<p>There was silence again while the mob wavered. Then there were
mutterings around us. Above these rang out the clear voice of the
girl whose hand Harry still held&mdash;unnecessarily, it seemed
to me.</p>

<p>"Do you not feel the sea wind? It has come at last. To the
tower! And the first man there will see by moonlight the full
white sails of the prince's ships."</p>

<p>For several hours I scoured the streets of the town, seeking
in vain my cousin and his companion; the sudden movement of the
crowd toward the Roman tower had separated us. On every side I
saw evidences of the terrible chastisement that had brought this
stout-hearted people to the verge of despair. A man with hungry
eyes chased a lean rat along the bank of the canal. A young
mother, with two dead babes in her arms, sat in a doorway to
which they bore the bodies of her husband and father, just killed
at the walls. In the middle of a deserted street I passed
unburied corpses in a pile twice as high as my head. The
pestilence had been there&mdash;kinder than the Spaniard, because
it held out no treacherous promises while it dealt its blows.</p>

<p>Toward morning the wind increased to a gale. There was no
sleep in Leyden, no more talk of surrender, no longer any thought
or care about defense. These words were on the lips of everybody
I met: "Daylight will bring the fleet!"</p>

<p>Did daylight bring the fleet? History says so, but I was not a
witness. I know only that before dawn the gale culminated in a
violent thunderstorm, and that at the same time a muffled
explosion, heavier than the thunder, shook the town. I was in the
crowd that watched from the Roman Mound for the first signs of
the approaching relief. The concussion shook hope out of every
face. "Their mine has reached the wall!" But where? I pressed
forward until I found the burgomaster, who was standing among the
rest. "Quick!" I whispered. "It is beyond the Cow Gate, and this
side of the Tower of Burgundy." He gave me a searching glance,
and then strode away, without making any attempt to quiet the
general panic. I followed close at his heels.</p>

<p>It was a tight run of nearly half a mile to the rampart in
question. When we reached the Cow Gate this is what we saw:</p>

<p>A great gap, where the wall had been, opening to the swampy
fields beyond: in the moat, outside and below, a confusion of
upturned faces, belonging to men who struggled like demons to
achieve the breach, and who now gained a few feet and now were
forced back; on the shattered rampart a handful of soldiers and
burghers forming a living wall where masonry had failed; perhaps
a double handful of women and girls, serving stones to the
defenders and boiling water in buckets, besides pitch and oil and
unslaked lime, and some of them quoiting tarred and burning hoops
over the necks of the Spaniards in the moat; my cousin Harry
leading and directing the men; the burgomaster's daughter
Gertruyd encouraging and inspiring the women.</p>

<p>But what attracted my attention more than anything else was
the frantic activity of a little figure in black, who, with a
huge ladle, was showering molten lead on the heads of the
assailing party. As he turned to the bonfire and kettle which
supplied him with ammunition, his features came into the full
light. I gave a cry of surprise: the ladler of molten lead was
Professor Van Stopp.</p>

<p>The burgomaster Van der Werf turned at my sudden exclamation.
"Who is that?" I said. "The man at the kettle?"</p>

<p>"That," replied Van der Werf, "is the brother of my wife, the
clockmaker Jan Lipperdam."</p>

<p>The affair at the breach was over almost before we had had
time to grasp the situation. The Spaniards, who had overthrown
the wall of brick and stone, found the living wall impregnable.
They could not even maintain their position in the moat; they
were driven off into the darkness. Now I felt a sharp pain in my
left arm. Some stray missile must have hit me while we watched
the fight.</p>

<p>"Who has done this thing?" demanded the burgomaster. "Who is
it that has kept watch on today while the rest of us were
straining fools' eyes toward tomorrow?"</p>

<p>Gertruyd van der Werf came forward proudly, leading my cousin.
"My father," said the girl, "he has saved my life."</p>

<p>"That is much to me," said the burgomaster, "but it is not
all. He has saved Leyden and he has saved Holland."</p>

<p>I was becoming dizzy. The faces around me seemed unreal. Why
were we here with these people? Why did the thunder and lightning
forever continue? Why did the clockmaker, Jan Lipperdam, turn
always toward me the face of Professor Van Stopp? "Harry!" I
said, "come back to our rooms."</p>

<p>But though he grasped my hand warmly his other hand still held
that of the girl, and he did not move. Then nausea overcame me.
My head swam, and the breach and its defenders faded from
sight.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p class="first">
THREE days later I sat with one arm bandaged in my accustomed
seat in Van Stopp's lecture room. The place beside me was
vacant.</p>

<p>"We hear much," said the Hegelian professor, reading from a
notebook in his usual dry, hurried tone, "of the influence of the
sixteenth century upon the nineteenth. No philosopher, as far as
I am aware, has studied the influence of the nineteenth century
upon the sixteenth. If cause produces effect, does effect never
induce cause? Does the law of heredity, unlike all other laws of
this universe of mind and matter, operate in one direction only?
Does the descendant owe everything to the ancestor, and the
ancestor nothing to the descendant? Does destiny, which may seize
upon our existence, and for its own purposes bear us far into the
future, never carry us back into the past?"</p>

<p>I went back to my rooms in the Breede Straat, where my only
companion was the silent clock.</p>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>08. &mdash; THE BALLOON TREE</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 25 Feb. 1883</h3>

<p class="first">THE colonel said:</p>

<p>We rode for several hours straight from the shore toward the
heart of the island. The sun was low in the western sky when we
left the ship. Neither on the water nor on the land had we felt a
breath of air stirring. The glare was upon everything. Over the
low range of hills miles away in the interior hung a few
copper-colored clouds. "Wind," said Briery. Kilooa shook his
head.</p>

<p>Vegetation of all kinds showed the effects of the long
continued drought. The eye wandered without relief from the
sickly russet of the undergrowth, so dry in places that leaves
and stems crackled under the horses' feet, to the yellowish-brown
of the thirsty trees that skirted the bridle path. No growing
thing was green except the bell-top cactus, fit to flourish in
the crater of a living volcano.</p>

<p>Kilooa leaned over in the saddle and tore from one of these
plants its top, as big as a California pear and bloated with
juice. He crushed the bell in his fist, and, turning, flung into
our hot faces a few grateful drops of water.</p>

<p>Then the guide began to talk rapidly in his language of vowels
and liquids. Briery translated for my benefit.</p>

<p>The god Lalala loved a woman of the island. He came in the
form of fire. She, accustomed to the ordinary temperature of the
clime, only shivered before his approaches. Then he wooed her as
a shower of rain and won her heart. Kakal was a divinity much
more powerful than Lalala, but malicious to the last degree. He
also coveted this woman, who was very beautiful. Kakal's
importunities were in vain. In spite, he changed her to a cactus,
and rooted her to the ground under the burning sun. The god
Lalala was powerless to avert this vengeance; but he took up his
abode with the cactus woman, still in the form of a rain shower,
and never left her, even in the driest seasons. Thus it happens
that the bell-top cactus is an unfailing reservoir of pure cool
water.</p>

<p>Long after dark we reached the channel of a vanished stream,
and Kilooa led us for several miles along its dry bed. We were
exceedingly tired when the guide bade us dismount. He tethered
the panting horses and then dashed into the dense thicket on the
bank. A hundred yards of scrambling, and we came to a poor
thatched hut. The savage raised both hands above his head and
uttered a musical falsetto, not unlike the yodel peculiar to the
Valais. This call brought out the occupant of the hut, upon whom
Briery flashed the light of his lantern. It was an old woman,
hideous beyond the imagination of a dyspeptic's dream.</p>

<p>"Omanana gelaãl!" exclaimed Kilooa.</p>

<p>"Hail, holy woman," translated Briery.</p>

<p>Between Kilooa and the holy hag there ensued a long colloquy,
respectful on his part, sententious and impatient on hers, Briery
listened with eager attention. Several times he clutched my arm,
as if unable to repress his anxiety. The woman seemed to be
persuaded by Kilooa's arguments, or won by his entreaties. At
last she pointed toward the southeast, slowly pronouncing a few
words that apparently satisfied my companions.</p>

<p>The direction indicated by the holy woman was still toward the
hills, but twenty or thirty degrees to the left of the general
course which we had pursued since leaving the shore.</p>

<p>"Push on! Push on!" cried Briery. "We can afford to lose no
time."</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
WE rode all night. At sunrise there was a pause of hardly ten
minutes for the scanty breakfast supplied by our haversacks. Then
we were again in the saddle, making our way through a thicket
that grew more and more difficult, and under a sun that grew
hotter.</p>

<p>"Perhaps," I remarked finally to my taciturn friend, "you have
no objection to telling me now why two civilized beings and one
amiable savage should be plunging through this infernal jungle,
as if they were on an errand of life or death?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "it is best you should know."</p>

<p>Briery produced from an inner breast pocket a letter which had
been read and reread until it was worn in the creases. "This," he
went on, "is from Professor Quakversuch of the University of
Upsala. It reached me at Valparaiso."</p>

<p>Glancing cautiously around, as if he feared that every tree
fern in that tropical wilderness was an eavesdropper, or that the
hood-like spathes of the giant caladiums overhead were ears
waiting to drink in some mighty secret of science, Briery read in
a low voice from the letter of the great Swedish botanist:</p>

<p>"You will have in these islands," <i>wrote the professor</i>,
"a rare opportunity to investigate certain extraordinary accounts
given me years ago by the Jesuit missionary Buteaux concerning
the Migratory Tree, the <i>cereus fragrans</i> of Jansenius and
other speculative physiologists.</p>

<p>"The explorer Spohr claims to have beheld it; but there is
reason, as you know, for accepting all of Spohr's statements with
caution.</p>

<p>"That is not the case with the assertions of my late valued
correspondent, the Jesuit missionary. Father Buteaux was a
learned botanist, an accurate observer, and a most pious and
conscientious man. He never saw the Migratory Tree; but during
the long period of his labors in that part of the world he
accumulated, from widely different sources, a mass of testimony
as to its existence and habits.</p>

<p>"Is it quite inconceivable, my dear Briery, that somewhere in
the range of nature there is a vegetable organization as far
above the cabbage, let us say, in complexity and potentiality as
the ape is above the polyp? Nature is continuous. In all her
schemes we find no chasms, no gaps. There may be missing links in
our books and classifications and cabinets, but there are none in
the organic world. Is not all of lower nature struggling upward
to arrive at the point of self-consciousness and volition? In the
unceasing process of evolution, differentiation, improvement in
special functions, why may not a plant arrive at this point and
feel, will, act, in short, possess and exercise the
characteristics of the true animal?"</p>

<p>Briery's voice trembled with enthusiasm as he read this.</p>

<p>"I have no doubt," <i>continued Professor Quakversuch</i>,
"that if it shall be your great good fortune to encounter a
specimen of the Migratory Tree described by Buteaux, you will
find that it possesses a well-defined system of real nerves and
ganglia, constituting, in fact, the seat of vegetable
intelligence. I conjure you to be very thorough in your
dissections.</p>

<p>"According to the indications furnished me by the Jesuit, this
extraordinary tree should belong to the order of Cactaceae. It
should be developed only in conditions of extreme heat and
dryness. Its roots should be hardly more than rudimentary,
affording a precarious attachment to the earth. This attachment
it should be able to sever at will, soaring up into the air and
away to another place selected by itself, as a bird shifts its
habitation. I infer that these migrations are accomplished by
means of the property of secreting hydrogen gas, with which it
inflates at pleasure a bladder-like organ of highly elastic
tissue, thus lifting itself out of the ground and off to a new
abode.</p>

<p>"Buteaux added that the Migratory Tree was invariably
worshiped by the natives as a supernatural being, and that the
mystery thrown by them around its cult was the greatest obstacle
in the path of the investigator."</p>

<p>"There!" exclaimed Briery, folding up Professor Quakversuch's
letter. "Is not that a quest worthy the risk or sacrifice of life
itself? To add to the recorded facts of vegetable morphology the
proved existence of a tree that wanders, a tree that wills, a
tree, perhaps, that thinks&mdash;this is glory to be won at any
cost! The lamented Decandolle of Geneva&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Confound the lamented Decandolle of Geneva!" shouted I, for
it was excessively hot, and I felt that we had come on a fool's
errand.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
IT was near sunset on the second day of our journey, when
Kilooa, who was riding several rods in advance of us, uttered a
quick cry, leaped from his saddle, and stooped to the ground.</p>

<p>Briery was at his side in an instant. I followed with less
agility; my joints were very stiff and I had no scientific
enthusiasm to lubricate them. Briery was on his hands and knees,
eagerly examining what seemed to be a recent disturbance of the
soil. The savage was prostrate, rubbing his forehead in the dust,
as if in a religious ecstasy, and warbling the same falsetto
notes that we had heard at the holy woman's hut.</p>

<p>"What beast's trail have you struck?" I demanded.</p>

<p>"The trail of no beast," answered Briery, almost angrily. "Do
you see this broad round abrasion of the surface, where a heavy
weight has rested? Do you see these little troughs in the fresh
earth, radiating from the center like the points of a star? They
are the scars left by slender roots torn up from their shallow
beds. Do you see Kilooa's hysterical performance? I tell you we
are on the track of the Sacred Tree. It has been here, and not
long ago."</p>

<p>Acting under Briery's excited instructions we continued the
hunt on foot. Kilooa started toward the east, I toward the west,
and Briery took the southward course.</p>

<p>To cover the ground thoroughly, we agreed to advance in
gradually widening zigzags, communicating with each other at
intervals by pistol shots. There could have been no more foolish
arrangement. In a quarter of an hour I had lost my head and my
bearings in a thicket. For another quarter of an hour I
discharged my revolver repeatedly, without getting a single
response from east or south. I spent the remainder of daylight in
a blundering effort to make my way back to the place where the
horses were; and then the sun went down, leaving me in sudden
darkness, alone in a wilderness of, the extent and character of
which I had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>I will spare you the history of my sufferings during the whole
of that night, and the next day, and the next night, and another
day. When it was dark I wandered about in blind despair, longing
for daylight, not daring to sleep or even to stop, and in
continual terror of the unknown dangers that surrounded me. In
the daytime I longed for night, for the sun scorched its way
through the thickest roof that the luxuriant foliage afforded,
and drove me nearly mad. The provisions in my haversack were
exhausted. My canteen was on my saddle; I should have died of
thirst had it not been for the bell-top cactus, which I found
twice. But in that horrible experience neither the torture of
hunger and thirst nor the torture of heat equaled the misery of
the thought that my life was to be sacrificed to the delusion of
a crazy botanist, who had dreamed of the impossible.</p>

<p>The impossible?</p>

<p>On the second afternoon, still staggering aimlessly on through
the jungle, I lost my last strength and fell to the ground.
Despair and indifference had long since given way to an eager
desire for the end. I closed my eyes with indescribable relief;
the hot sun seemed pleasant on my face as consciousness
departed.</p>

<p>Did a beautiful and gentle woman come to me while I lay
unconscious, and take my head in her lap, and put her arms around
me? Did she press her face to mine and in a whisper bid me have
courage? That was the belief that filled my mind when it
struggled back for a moment into consciousness; I clutched at the
warm, soft arms, and swooned again.</p>

<p>Do not look at each other and smile, gentlemen; in that cruel
wilderness, in my helpless condition, I found pity and benignant
tenderness. The next time my senses returned I saw that Something
was bending over me&mdash;something majestic if not beautiful,
humane if not human, gracious if not woman. The arms that held me
and drew me up were moist, and they throbbed with the pulsation
of life. There was a faint, sweet odor, like the smell of a
woman's perfumed hair. The touch was a caress, the clasp an
embrace.</p>

<p>Can I describe its form? No, not with the definiteness that
would satisfy the Quakversuches and the Brierys. I saw that the
trunk was massive. The branches that lifted me from the ground
and held me carefully and gently were flexible and symmetrically
disposed. Above my head there was a wreath of strange foliage,
and in the midst of it a dazzling sphere of scarlet. The scarlet
globe grew while I watched it but the effort of watching was too
much for me.</p>

<p>Remember, if you please, that at this time, physical
exhaustion and mental torture had brought me to the point where I
passed to and fro between consciousness and unconsciousness as
easily and as frequently as one fluctuates between slumber and
wakefulness during a night of fever. It seemed the most natural
thing in the world that in my extreme weakness I should be
beloved and cared for by a cactus. I did not seek an explanation
of this good fortune, or try to analyze it; I simply accepted it
as a matter of course, as a child accepts a benefit from an
unexpected quarter. The one idea that possessed me was that I had
found an unknown friend, instinct with womanly sympathy and
immeasurably kind.</p>

<p>And as night came on it seemed to me that the scarlet bulb
overhead became enormously distended, so that it almost filled
the sky. Was I gently rocked by the supple arms that still held
me? Were we floating off together into the air? I did not know,
or care. Now I fancied that I was in my berth on board ship,
cradled by the swell of the sea; now, that I was sharing the
flight of some great bird; now, that I was borne on with
prodigious speed through the darkness by my own volition. The
sense of incessant motion affected all my dreams. Whenever I
awoke I felt a cool breeze steadily beating against my
face&mdash;the first breath of air since we had landed. I was
vaguely happy, gentlemen. I had surrendered all responsibility
for my own fate. I had gained the protection of a being of
superior powers.</p>

<p>"The brandy flask, Kilooa!"</p>

<p>It was daylight. I lay upon the ground and Briery was
supporting my shoulders. In his face was a look of bewilderment
that I shall never forget.</p>

<p>"My God!" he cried, "and how did you get here? We gave up the
search two days ago."</p>

<p>The brandy pulled me together. I staggered to my feet and
looked around. The cause of Briery's extreme amazement was
apparent at a glance. We were not in the wilderness. We were at
the shore. There was the bay, and the ship at anchor, half a mile
off. They were already lowering a boat to send for us.</p>

<p>And there to the south was a bright red spot on the horizon,
hardly larger than the morning star&mdash;the Balloon Tree
returning to the wilderness. I saw it, Briery saw it, the savage
Kilooa saw it. We watched it till it vanished. We watched it with
very different emotions, Kilooa with superstitious reverence,
Briery with scientific interest and intense disappointment, I
with a heart full of wonder and gratitude.</p>

<p>I clasped my forehead with both hands. It was no dream, then.
The Tree, the caress, the embrace, the scarlet bulb, the night
journey through the air, were not creations and incidents of
delirium. Call it tree, or call it plant-animal&mdash;there it
was! Let men of science quarrel over the question of its
existence in nature; this I know: It had found me dying and had
brought me more than a hundred miles straight to the ship where I
belonged. Under Providence, gentlemen, that sentient and
intelligent vegetable organism had saved my life.</p>

<p>At this point the colonel got up and left the club. He was
very much moved. Pretty soon Briery came in, briskly as usual. He
picked up an uncut copy of Lord Bragmuch's <i>Travels in
Kerguellon's Land</i>, and settled himself in an easy chair at
the corner of the fireplace.</p>

<p>Young Traddies timidly approached the veteran globetrotter.
"Excuse me, Mr. Briery," said he, "but I should like to ask you a
question about the Balloon Tree. Were there scientific reasons
for believing that its sex was&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah," interrupted Briery, looking bored; "the colonel has been
favoring you with that extraordinary narrative? Has he honored me
again with a share in the adventure? Yes? Well, did we bag the
game this time?"</p>

<p>"Why, no," said young Traddies. "You last saw the Tree as a
scarlet spot against the horizon."</p>

<p>"By Jove, another miss!" said Briery, calmly beginning to cut
the leaves of his book.</p>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>09. &mdash; OLD SQUIDS AND LITTLE SPELLER</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 19 July 1885</h3>

<p class="first">
IN the days of content, when wants were few and well supplied,
when New England rum was pure and cheap, and while the older
generation still wore the knee breeches and turkey-tailed coats
of colonial days, and Bailey, who kept a tollgate on the Hartford
and Providence turnpike, died. For forty years after the
Revolution, Bailey lived in the solitary little tollhouse, near
the bridge over the turbulent Quinnebaug, and in all that time
had never failed to answer the call to come and take toll; but
one night he responded not, and they found him sitting in his
chair with an open Bible on his knees, and his spirit gone to the
country of which he had been reading.</p>

<p>So it happened that a few days after, the big coach left a
tall young man at the Quinnebaug tollhouse, who brought with him
his possessions encased in a handkerchief. The driver of the
stage informed the young man that here was the scene of his
future activities for the turnpike company, and added as he saw
the young fellow staring at the board beside the door on which,
at a long distant time, the rates of toll had been painted, "See
here, Old Squids, you'd better chalk up some new figures. The old
ones is about washed out."</p>

<p>The driver called him Old Squids, but aside from the fact that
such a surname, if such it was, had never been heard before in
that country, it was strange that he should have been called old.
He was, in fact, a young fellow, not more than two or three and
twenty, seemingly. Though his skin was bronzed, it was smooth,
and though his beard was tangled, each hair at cross purposes, it
had never known the razor, and was, therefore, silky. He was
sinewy, though his joints were protuberant, and his broad
shoulders were not erect. Yet, perhaps, they called him old
because he was moderate in his way, not so much because of
laziness as by inborn disposition.</p>

<p>When the coach rolled away Squids was left standing there,
gazing with a perplexed expression at the toll board and
abstractedly tugging at his beard. No wonder he was perplexed.
There appeared only fragments of words on the board, for the
rains had washed the paint away with bewildering irregularity. He
could make nothing of it. The very first thing that Squids did,
therefore, was to tear down the board and take it into the little
cottage. Then, without any examination of his new home, he threw
his bundle upon the bed and began to repair the damage that time
had done to the board. But age had done its inevitable work with
it, and as Squids held it on his knees it crumbled in his strong
grasp and broke into fragments, as though the rude change, after
forty years of unmeddled security on the door, had been too much
for it.</p>

<p>Squids sorrowfully looked at the fragments at his feet, then
gathered them up carefully, and gave them a decent interment in
an old chest. For a week Squids labored to make a new toll board.
Not that the board itself needed so much time, but, alas, the
announcement on it did. For, skillful as Squids was with the
hammer and saw and nails, his fingers were clumsy with the pencil
and paintbrush. Hour after hour he worked, studying the printed
card of rates which the company had given him, so that he might
transfer those figures and letters intelligibly upon the board.
One night he even dreamed how it should be done, and dreaming,
awoke with delight, lighted his candle, and down on his knees he
went, to transfer the dream to the board. But his fingers refused
to respond to the picture in his mind, and, with a sigh, Squids
returned to bed.</p>

<p>At last Squids gave it up. He simply painted upon the board
something like this:</p>

<br>

<p class="sign">MAN 1 CT. HORSE 2 CT. CRITTERS ASK ME</p>

<br>

<p>The words and the spelling of them he slyly obtained from some
passing stranger who wrote them out for Squids upon a shingle.
This new board he hung up in the old place, and when he saw
anyone, man or beast, approaching the gate, he brought out his
tariff card in case anybody should ask him the toll.</p>

<p>The manager of the company passing by in the stage, though he
smiled at the board, comforted Squids by saying that he had done
well, and then the manager told his companion that Squids was
odd, but faithful, and had given proof of his integrity to one of
the company's directors. "He doesn't know any name but Squids,"
said the manager, "and we suppose he is some whaler's waif cast
ashore in New London, and left to look out for himself. But he is
faithful."</p>

<p>But Squids, while pacified by the manager's approval, was by
no means content. "Someday," said he to himself, as he gazed
sadly at his rather abortive effort, "I'll put one up that'll be
a credit."</p>

<p>Squids seemed happy enough in his lonely home. He made few
friends, for the spot was remote from the farms of that town. The
stage drivers liked him, for he always gave each of them a glass
of cool milk. Squids's only possession, besides his clothes, was
a cow.</p>

<p>One day one of the drivers said to him: "See here, old Squids.
I've been a drinking your milk, off and on, a year or more for
nothing. What can I get for you up to Hartford that will sorter
square it up?"</p>

<p>"You might bring me a spelling book," said Squids. "If you'll
buy it and bring it, I'll pay what it costs: not more than a
dollar, I guess."</p>

<p>On the next down trip the driver handed Squids a Webster's
spelling book. His blue eyes sparkled as he received it, but he
said nothing except to express his thanks. But when the stage
rolled away, and Squids was alone, he opened the book haphazard,
and then, standing before the billboard, said, with an accent of
triumph in his tone and the gleam of victory in his eye. "By moy
I can paint one and put it up that will be a credit."</p>

<p>Squids could spell two- and three-letter words, but beyond
that he found himself mired in many difficulties very often. He
struggled and wrestled manfully, but rather despairingly, with
the two-syllabled words in the speller. "That's a B," he would
say, "sure, and that's an A, and that spells Ba. But I don't
quite get this 'ere yet. That's a K, that's an E, and that's an
R. K is a K. E is an E. R is an R. Ker. That must be Keer.
Bakeer. Now what kind of word is that?"</p>

<p>Thus Baker overthrew him and he was very despondent. One
night, as he lay upon his bed, his eyes wide open and his brain
throbbing with the misery of the mystery of Bakeer, a great light
came to him. He arose, lighted a candle, and from his canvas bag
drew forth ten copper pennies, which he placed conspicuously upon
his table. Then he no sooner touched his pillow than he fell
asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning the ten coppers were given to the driver, with
the request that they should be exchanged at Hartford for ten
peppermint bull's-eyes, streaked red and white. When Squids
received the bull's-eyes he put them away on a plate in his
cupboard and bided his time until the next Saturday afternoon. At
that time, about an hour before sundown, he began to peer up the
road toward the bend, for it was at such time that he knew that
every Saturday a young lad came along with some good things from
his father's farm for the minister's Sunday dinner at the
parsonage, a mile away on the other side of the Quinnebaug. At
last Squids caught sight of the boy, who bore a basket on his arm
seemingly heavily laden. Squids, with a slyness born of some
sense of shame, concealed himself in the tollhouse. Soon the lad
was at the gate calling upon Squids to come out and pass him.</p>

<p>"Hulloo! It's you, is it, Ebenezer, going to the minister's?
That basket must be heavy. Should think you'd want to rest a
bit."</p>

<p>"'Tis heavy. There's a sparerib in it?"</p>

<p>"M'm. Want to know," said Squids, opening his eyes in surprise
and sympathy well simulated. "Come in and sit down. Mebbe I can
give you something kinder good."</p>

<p>"Now what's that air thing?" asked Squids, when he had
Ebenezer in the house, holding up the monstrously tempting
confection before the boy's eyes.</p>

<p>"Pepentink bull's-eyes," said the boy, delightedly.</p>

<p>"You like 'em. You shall have one." Here Squids seemed about
to give Ebenezer the candy, but suddenly restrained himself.</p>

<p>"Hold on," he said. "You've got to earn it. Oh! You go to
school?"</p>

<p>"Yes, in winter."</p>

<p>"H'm-m. How far have you got?"</p>

<p>"I've got to fractions and second reader."</p>

<p>"Sho! No! I wan't to know. Now let's see." Here Squids
meditatively produced the Webster's speller from its place under
his pillow, and opening it, said: "H'm-m. Let's see. Now, here,
if you will read that colyumn down straight you shall have two
bull's-eyes. Right here. Just to see how much you know."</p>

<p>"That's easy," said Ebenezer. "I will read some harder
ones."</p>

<p>Squids seemed a little perplexed. At length he said, "Let's
try the easy ones first. It'll be so much easier to earn the
bull's-eyes. Don't you see?" And Squids placed the point of his
jackknife blade upon Baker.</p>

<p>"That's Baker," said Ebenezer.</p>

<p>"Baker," replied Squids, with the queerest accent in his
voice. "Baker. Sho! so 'tis." Here Squids abstractedly combed his
beard with his jackknife.</p>

<p>"Of course it's Baker. Ker don't spell keer. Anybody but a
fool might a' known that. Let me write it down, Ebenezer."</p>

<p>Then Squids, somewhat to the astonishment of Ebenezer, brought
forth a shingle, and on the smooth white side, with a piece of
charcoal, spelled out the word B-a-k-e-r.</p>

<p>"What do you write it down for, Squids?" asked the boy.</p>

<p>"What for? Oh, only to see how many you get right," replied
the cunning Squids.</p>

<p>Thus Squids mastered some ten or twelve words, and the boy
received two bull's-eyes, and Squids made a covenant with him
that he should stop there every Saturday afternoon and show
Squids whether he could read rightly such words in Webster's
speller as Squids showed him, for which he was to receive two or
more bull's-eyes.</p>

<p>Thus Squids, taught by a bribed and unconscious teacher,
mastered the speller and began to make preparations to build a
new toll board on which he purposed to paint the tariff of prices
in a manner that would be a credit.</p>

<p>But something happened that made the new toll board and the
credit that it was to be seem of petty consequence to him. One
evening in March, when the line storm was raging without, Squids,
with his speller on the table between two candles, and a shingle
on his knee, was painting out with almost infinite pains the word
cattle, so that he might be schooled in printing it correctly and
as artistically as possible upon the toll board.</p>

<p>Suddenly Squids paused in his work and listened. There was
surely a knock upon his door. The sound was not made by the
beating of the oak branches on the roof. Squids took a candle and
opened the door. A gust of wind blew the light out, as well as
the other one on the table, but Squids had seen a woman's form on
the doorstep, and he put forth his hand and drew her within. He
bade her be patient until he relighted the candle, but before he
could do so he heard her staggering step, and then he knew that
she had fallen.</p>

<p>When Squids at last with nervous fingers coaxed a spark into
the tinder and lighted a candle, he saw that the woman seemed to
have sunk to the floor. Her face, over which her hair had fallen
and was matted by the rain, was pale, and her eyes, half-opened
with unconscious stare, seemed to him like the eyes of the dead.
Her head, having fallen back, rested against the door. Squids
held the candle to her parted lips and saw that she was not dead,
but faint, and even before he could apply the simple remedies
that he had, she had somewhat recovered. She feebly rose,
tottered to a chair, and then for the first time Squids saw that
which startled him far more than her unconscious form had done.
He saw in her arms the peaceful face of a sleeping infant.</p>

<p>She drank a glass of water, and Squids bustled about to
prepare for her a cup of tea, for which he had made of great
potency, so that, having taken it, she greatly revived.</p>

<p>"You're very wet," said Squids, and he threw some logs upon
the hearth, urging her to draw near the fire. She did so, but
with such manner of indifference that it seemed to Squids that
she cared little whether she was wet or dry.</p>

<p>Though he had never touched the smooth, soft flesh of an
infant before, Squids gently took this one from her unresisting
arms and laid it upon his pillow. The child had not been wet by
the storm, and Squids carefully tucked the quilt under the
pillow. It did not even awaken under his unaccustomed touch, and
as he looked upon the little sleeping one upon his pillow, with a
chubby hand resting beside its cheek, Squids vowed that neither
mother nor child should leave the house that night.</p>

<p>The woman watched him with the first sign of interest she had
shown, and she said at length, "You are kind, very kind."</p>

<p>"That air's a cute little beauty," was all the reply Squids
made. The woman told him an incoherent, rambling story about
missing the stage and losing her way, and she begged that she
might rest there until the next stage came. Squids urged her to
make herself comfortable, and he set milk and bread before her.
Then, with cautions respecting the need of thorough drying,
Squids went away to the little loft. He listened as he lay upon
an extemporized bed, but all was silent below, and when he was
assured that the stranger was in comfort he fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning Squids knocked at the door, but there was no
response. "She is tired: let her sleep," said Squids to
himself.</p>

<p>But by and by there being no sound within, Squids ventured to
knock again, and still getting no response opened the door. The
room was vacant.</p>

<p>"She went away before I awoke," reasoned Squids, and he set
about getting his breakfast.</p>

<p>Soon he heard that which caused him to stop and stand in utter
amazement. He did not stir until he heard the sound again.</p>

<p>"Ma! Ma!" It came to him once more, and then, gently raising
the bed-quilt, Squids's eyes met those of the baby.</p>

<p>The little thing put up its hands, chuckled, and bounced up
and down upon the pillow.</p>

<p>"Mo! Mo!" it said.</p>

<p>"Mo! Mo!" said Squids. "That means moolly, moolly. It wants
milk."</p>

<p>In an instant Squids was warming a basin of milk. "I calculate
it'll like it sweet," he meditated. So he put in a heaping
spoonful of sugar. Then, with the tenderness of a mother, Squids
fed the little one, spoonful by spoonful, till at last it pushed
the spoon away with its fat little hands, and, reaching up, clung
with gentle yet firm grasp to Squids's long and silky beard, and
then, tugging away, looked up into his eyes, and laughed and
crowed.</p>

<p>"Seems as though it knowed me," said Squids. "I vum, the cute
little rascal thinks it knows me," and two tears dropped from
Squids' eyes right down upon the baby's cheek, and it lifted up
one hand in sport, and as it felt of Squids's rough skin, it
brushed away another tear or two with its frolicking. And Squids
held his face down to it, and clucked and clucked, and spoke
softly with all the instinct of paternity within him aroused. At
last the little one's hands relaxed, and its eyelids drooped, and
it fell asleep, and Squids stood there watching it, how long he
knew not.</p>

<p>Thus Squids had a companion brought to him. He never knew why
the mother, if such she was, left the baby there, or where she
had gone, and as the days went by he began to have a secret
terror lest she should sometime come and claim it. But she did
not. No more thought had Squids for the new toll board, only as
he set it before the child for a table whereon were gathered the
marvelous toys that Squids whittled for it with his jackknife.
Squids early discovered that the baby liked wheels above all
things, and that it displayed wonderful cunning in the
arrangement of them after he had whittled them out.</p>

<p>One day Squids found him gazing wonderingly at the Webster's
speller, and though fearful of the lawlessness of those little
hands, Squids bound the covers firmly together with cords and
suffered him to play with the book. Then Squids called the baby
Little Speller, and never by any other name. The little one tried
hard to say Squids, but could only lisp "Thid," so that Squids
came to like this diminutive as spoken by the child better than
all other sounds.</p>

<p>"Someday you and me will rastle with this book, and I
calculate we'll get the best of it, won't we, sir?" Squids would
say to the child when it grew old enough to understand, and the
little one would reply, "Yes we will, Thid."</p>

<p>Thus they lived, day by day, Little Speller content, while
Squids&mdash;his happiness was a revelation of delight of which
he had had no conception. By and by, when the little one was
older, Squids would take him on his knee, and with the Webster
speller and a new slate brought from Hartford, they would take up
their tasks.</p>

<p>"That's A, sir. See how I make it. One line down, so, and
another down, so, and one across, and that makes A." And Little
Speller, with faltering fingers, would draw the lines and say,
"That's A, Thid," and Squids would laugh and say, "We'll have a
toll board by and by that will be a credit, and no mistake."</p>

<p>One day Squids spelled out horse on the slate, and Little
Speller took the pencil and sketched a horse with very
rectangular head and body and very wavy legs, and he said, "No,
that's horse, Thid."</p>

<p>Squids roared, and got a shingle and made Little Speller spell
horse in that way on it with a crayon. Then Squids nailed the
shingle on the wall over the fireplace, and when anybody came in
he would point proudly to it, saying, "See how Little Speller
spells horse. He's a cute one!"</p>

<p>But before many months went by Squids found that the boy and
he were exchanging places, for the teacher was becoming the
taught and the scholar becoming the teacher. So Squids sent to
Hartford and bought a first reader and an arithmetic, and great
was their delight in pondering over the mysteries of these books
and solving them.</p>

<p>"Little Speller," said Squids, one day, "you took to spelling
natural, but you take to 'rithmetic more natural. But it's beyond
me. After this you'll have to do the figgering and the spelling
for me."</p>

<p>That the child had a talent for mathematics and mechanics
Squids understood fully, though he could not express it in any
other way than by saying: "He's mighty sharp at figgers and
mighty cute with the jackknife."</p>

<p>One morning, as Squids was opening the tollgate, he astonished
the traveler who waited to pass through by suddenly stopping and
staring at the house. The stranger feared he had gone mad, or was
carrying too much New England rum, till Squids, with triumphant
utterance, said, "Look at that air. That's a credit at last," and
he pointed to a new toll board neatly painted and accurately
lettered. Then he rushed into the house and brought forth the
lad.</p>

<p>"This is the boy that done it," said Squids, "unbeknown to me,
and nailed her up unbeknown. Ain't that a credit? It is Little
Speller, it is."</p>

<p>Then, when Little Speller grew older, he builded, with
Squids's help, a marvelous tollgate that opened and shut
automatically by the touching of a lever; and the fame of it
spread, so that the manager even came, and wondered, too, and
praised the lad, saying: "Squids, that boy is a genius,
sure."</p>

<p>And Squids would watch Little Speller, when the lad knew it
not, as an enthusiast studies a painting, and many and many a
time did Squids in the night quietly arise from the bed, light a
candle, and look, with something like awe in his glance, upon the
face of the sleeping boy.</p>

<p>One day there came to the Quinnebaug tollgate some men, and
they drove stakes and dug ditches, and builded a great dam across
the river, half a mile above. Then they put up a building, larger
than any Little Speller ever saw, and placed within it curious
machines, and they put a huge wheel outside the building. Little
Speller seemed entranced as he watched them day by day, and he
caused the men to deal with him with great respect, because at a
critical time in setting up the wheel, when it seemed as though
something had gone wrong, they heard a little voice shouting
peremptorily, "Loose your ropes, quick," and they did so, and the
wheel settled properly in place. The men wondered how it was that
that little fellow standing there on a rock could have shouted so
commandingly that they trusted him. But they said: "He's got some
gumption, sure."</p>

<p>When the big wheel was set agoing and the machines in the mill
began to make a frightful clatter, then it was that Little
Speller's enthusiasm and delight seemed to be greater even than
such a little body as his could contain. He spent hours and hours
in the mill watching the machines as they wove the threads of
wool into cloth.</p>

<p>By and by Squids saw that Little Speller was silent, dreaming
abstracted, and Squids became alarmed. "It's that air dreadful
noise in the mill that's confusing his little head," reasoned
Squids: and he urged the boy to go there less frequently, but
Little Speller went as was his wont. At length, Squids saw that
the boy was busying himself day and night with the jackknife and
such other tools as were there, and Squids was pleased, though he
could not comprehend what this strange thing was that Little
Speller was building. The boy seemed absorbed by his work. When
he ate, his great dreamy eyes were fixed abstractedly upon his
plate; but he slept soundly, and Squids was not greatly
alarmed.</p>

<p>"There's something in him that's working out," reasoned
Squids, and when he saw the fierce energy and enthusiasm with
which Little Speller cut and shaped and planed and fashioned the
bits of wood, Squids was sure that whatever it was that was
working out of him was working out well.</p>

<p>One day Little Speller said, as he put his hand on the thing
he had made, "There, it's done, and it's all right. It's better
than the ones they've got in the mill, only it's wood."</p>

<p>"What might it be, Little Speller?" asked Squids.</p>

<p>"It's a weaving machine."</p>

<p>"It's worked out of you. Part of you is in that thing, Little
Speller, and it's a greater credit than the toll board or the
gate."</p>

<p>Then Squids in great glee went and fetched the superintendent
of the mill. "See," said he, when he had brought the man, "that
air is worked out of Little Speller. Part of him is in it, and
it's a credit."</p>

<p>The superintendent glanced with some interest at the model,
more to please the lad and Squids than for any other reason.
"Show him how it works," said Squids.</p>

<p>Little Speller did so. It was rude, clumsy; but as the boy
explained the working of it, the superintendent became excited.
He fingered it himself. He worked at it. Great beads of sweat
stood on his forehead, for he was intensely interested. At last
he said: "That will revolutionize woolen mills. The thing's built
wrong, but the idea is there. Where did you get that idea,
Squids?"</p>

<p>"Me!" exclaimed Squids. "Me! 'Taint me. It worked out of
Little Speller. It's been working out of him ever since the mill
was built. Ain't it a credit?"</p>

<p>"Credit!" and the superintendent smiled. "What do you want for
it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want to see one built and set to working in the mill," said
Little Speller.</p>

<p>"Will you let me build it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you only will," begged Little Speller.</p>

<p>"Put that down in writing, and I'll promise you I'll fit the
mill with them; yes, and a hundred mills."</p>

<p>Squids and Little Speller seemed dazed by this unexpected
glory.</p>

<p>"He's going to put what's worked out of you into a hundred
mills, Little Speller," said Squids, as he looked almost
reverentially upon the boy.</p>

<p>It was as the superintendent had said. Seizing Little
Speller's idea, he had properly handled it, builded machines,
obtained patents, therefore, and had revolutionized the woolen
mills that were then springing up throughout eastern New England,
and had he opened a mine of gold there on the banks of the
Quinnebaug, the superintendent could hardly have had more
riches.</p>

<p>But Squids and Little Speller were content. They would go up
to the mill and watch the new machine, weaving yards and yards of
cloth, Little Speller with the most ecstatic delight, and Squids
with a sense of awe. "That's you, Little Speller. That's you
working. It ain't the machine. That's only wood and iron."</p>

<p>By and by Little Speller began to appear abstracted again, and
he spent many hours watching the transmission of power from the
water wheel to the machinery. "Something more is working out,"
reasoned Squids, but he held his peace.</p>

<p>One day Squids heard someone coming down the road. He went to
open the gate. There were four or five men, and they were bearing
a burden. When they were near, Squids saw that they moved gently
and bore their burden tenderly and that their faces were very
grave. They did not try to pass the gate, but instead entered
Squids's little house and laid their burden upon his bed. Then
Squids saw Little Speller's pale face, and a little red thread
that was vividly tracing its way on the white cheek down from the
temple, and the eyes were closed and the hand hung limp. Squids
stood there motionless a long time, then, turning to the men, he
said, with dull, phlegmatic speech and a veiled appearance of his
eyes:</p>

<p>"Was he working it out?"</p>

<p>"He was," said one, "and he forgot himself and got too near
the shafting and it&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. He was a-working it out," said Squids mechanically,
and with no intelligence in his eyes. Then suddenly he darted
fiercely to the bedside. Little Speller had opened his eyes. He
saw Squids and knew him.</p>

<p>"Thid," he said.</p>

<p>Squids bent over him, but could not speak.</p>

<p>"Thid, I shall never work it out," he whispered.</p>

<p>Then he turned his eyes longingly to the old model across the
room, and then looked imploringly at Squids. The gatekeeper read
his wishes. He pushed the old model up to the bedside. Then
Little Speller put one hand upon it, and with the other
outstretched till the palm rested gently upon Squids's face, he
looked up with one peaceful glance and the flicker of a faint
smile, and then the light passed out of Little Speller's eyes
forever.</p>

<p>The men saw what had happened and went quietly away, leaving
Squids alone with Little Speller.</p>

<p>In the afterdays, Squids would sit by the old model, gently
speaking to it, and affectionately causing its mechanism to be
put in operation, and he would say, "Little Speller is in there.
He is in a hundred mills. You can hear him, but I, when I look at
this, I can see him, too."</p>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>10. &mdash; THE FACTS IN THE RATCLIFF CASE</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 7 March 1879</h3>

<p class="first">
I FIRST met Miss Borgier at a tea party in the town of
R&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, where I was attending medical lectures.
She was a tall girl, not pretty; her face would have been insipid
but for the peculiar restlessness of her eyes. They were neither
bright nor expressive, yet she kept them so constantly in motion
that they seemed to catch and reflect light from a thousand
sources. Whenever, as rarely happened, she fixed them even for a
few seconds upon one object, the factitious brilliancy
disappeared, and they became dull and somnolent. I am unable to
say what was the color of Miss Borgier's eyes.</p>

<p>After tea, I was one of a group of people whom our host, the
Reverend Mr. Tinker, sought to entertain with a portfolio of
photographs of places in the Holy Land. While endeavoring to
appear interested in his descriptions and explanations, all of
which I had heard before, I became aware that Miss Borgier was
honoring me with steady regard. My gaze encountered hers and I
found that I could not, for the life of me, withdraw my own eyes
from the encounter. Then I had a singular experience, the
phenomena of which I noted with professional accuracy. I felt the
slight constriction of the muscles of my face, the numbness of
the nerves that precedes physical stupor induced by narcotic
agency. Although I was obliged to struggle against the physical
sense of drowsiness, my mental faculties were more than
ordinarily active. Her eyes seemed to torpify my body while they
stimulated my mind, as opium does. Entirely conscious of my
present surroundings, and particularly alert to the Reverend Mr.
Tinker's narrative of the ride from Joppa, I accompanied him on
that journey, not as one who listens to a traveler's tale, but as
one who himself travels the road. When, finally, we reached the
point where the Reverend Mr. Tinker's donkey makes the last sharp
turn around the rock that has been cutting off the view ahead,
and the Reverend Mr. Tinker beholds with amazement and joy the
glorious panorama of Jerusalem spread out before him, I saw it
all with remarkable vividness. I saw Jerusalem in Miss Borgier's
eyes.</p>

<p>I tacitly thanked fortune when her eyes resumed their habitual
dance around the room, releasing me from what had become a rather
humiliating captivity. Once free from their strange influence, I
laughed at my weakness. "Pshaw!" I said to myself. "You are a
fine subject for a young woman of mesmeric talents to practice
upon."</p>

<p>"Who is Miss Borgier?" I demanded of the Reverend Mr. Tinker's
wife, at the first opportunity.</p>

<p>"Why, she is Deacon Borgier's daughter," replied that good
person, with some surprise.</p>

<p>"And who is Deacon Borgier?"</p>

<p>"A most excellent man; one of the pillars of my husband's
congregation. The young people laugh at what they call his
torpidity, and say that he has been walking about town in his
sleep for twenty years; but I assure you that there is not a
sincerer, more fervent Chris&mdash;"</p>

<p>I turned abruptly around, leaving Mrs. Tinker more astonished
than ever, for I knew that the subject of my inquiries was
looking at me again. She sat in one corner of the room, apart
from the rest of the company. I straightway went and seated
myself at her side.</p>

<p>"That is right," she said. "I wished you to come. Did you
enjoy your journey to Jerusalem?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks to you."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But you can repay the obligation. I am told that you
are Dr. Mack's assistant in surgery at the college. There is a
clinic tomorrow. I want to attend it."</p>

<p>"As a patient?" I inquired.</p>

<p>She laughed. "No, as a spectator. You must find a way to
gratify my curiosity."</p>

<p>I expressed, as politely as possible, my astonishment at so
extraordinary a fancy on the part of a young lady, and hinted at
the scandal which her appearance in the amphitheater would
create. She immediately offered to disguise herself in male
attire. I explained that the nature of the relations between the
medical college and the patients who consented to submit to
surgical treatment before the class were such that it would be a
dishonorable thing for me to connive at the admission of any
outsider, male or female. That argument made no impression upon
her mind. I was forced to decline peremptorily to serve her in
the affair. "Very well," she said. "I must find some other
way."</p>

<p>At the clinic the next day I took pains to satisfy myself that
Miss Borgier had not surreptitiously intruded. The students of
the class came in at the hour, noisy and careless as usual, and
seated themselves in the lower tiers of chairs around the
operating table. They produced their notebooks and began to
sharpen lead pencils. Miss Borgier was certainly not among them.
Every face in the lecture room was familiar to me. I locked the
door that opened into the hallway, and then searched the anteroom
on the other side of the amphitheater. There were a dozen or more
patients, nervous and dejected, waiting for treatment and
attended by friends hardly less frightened than themselves. But
neither Miss Borgier nor anybody resembling Miss Borgier was of
the number.</p>

<p>Dr. Mack now briskly entered by his private door. He glanced
sharply at the table on which his instruments were arranged,
ready for use, and, having assured himself that everything was in
its place, began the clinical lecture. There were the usual minor
operations&mdash;two or three for strabismus, one for cataract,
the excision of several cysts and tumors, large and small, the
amputation of a railway brakeman's crushed thumb. As the cases
were disposed of, I attended the patients back to the anteroom
and placed them in the care of their friends.</p>

<p>Last came a poor old lady named Wilson, whose leg had been
drawn up for years by a rheumatic affection, so that the joint of
the knee had ossified. It was one of those cases where the
necessary treatment is almost brutal in its simplicity. The limb
had to be straightened by the application of main force. Mrs.
Wilson obstinately refused to take advantage of anesthesia. She
was placed on her back upon the operating table, with a pillow
beneath her head. The geniculated limb showed a deflection of
twenty or twenty-five degrees from a right line. As already
remarked, this deflection had to be corrected by direct, forcible
pressure downward upon the knee.</p>

<p>With the assistance of a young surgeon of great physical
strength, Dr. Mack proceeded to apply this pressure. The
operation is one of the most excruciating that can be imagined. I
was stationed at the head of the patient, in order to hold her
shoulders should she struggle. But I observed that a marked
change had come over her since we established her upon the table.
Very much agitated at first, she had become perfectly calm. As
she passively lay there, her eyes directed upward with a fixed
gaze, the eyelids heavy as if with approaching slumber, the face
tranquil, it was hard to realize that this woman had already
crossed the threshold of an experience of cruel pain.</p>

<p>I had no time, however, to give more than a thought to her
wonderful courage. The harsh operation had begun. The surgeon and
his assistant were steadily and with increasing force bearing
down upon the rigid knee. Perhaps the Spanish Inquisition never
devised a method of inflicting physical torture more intense than
that which this woman was now undergoing, yet not a muscle of her
face quivered. She breathed easily and regularly, her features
retained their placid expression, and, at the moment when her
sufferings must have been the most agonizing, I saw her eyes
close, as if in peaceful sleep.</p>

<p>At the same instant the tremendous force exerted upon the knee
produced its natural effect. The ossified joint yielded, and,
with a sickening noise&mdash;the indescribable sound of the
crunching and gritting of the bones of a living person, a sound
so frightful that I have seen old surgeons, with sensibilities
hardened by long experience, turn pale at hearing it&mdash;the
crooked limb became as straight as its mate.</p>

<p>Closely following this horrible sound, I heard a ringing peal
of laughter.</p>

<p>The operating table, in the middle of the pit of the
amphitheater, was lighted from overhead. Directly above the
table, a shaft, five or six feet square, and closely boarded on
its four sides, led up through the attic story of the building to
a skylight in the roof. The shaft was so deep and so narrow that
its upper orifice was visible from no part of the room except a
limited space immediately around the table. The laughter which
startled me seemed to come from overhead. If heard by any other
person present, it was probably ascribed to a hysterical
utterance on the part of the patient. I was in a position to know
better. Instinctively I glanced upward, in the direction in which
the eyes of Mrs. Wilson had been so fixedly bent.</p>

<p>There, framed in a quadrangle of blue sky, I saw the head and
neck of Miss Borgier. The sash of the skylight had been removed,
to afford ventilation. The young woman was evidently lying at
full length upon the fiat roof. She commanded a perfect view of
all that was done upon the operating table. Her face was flushed
with eager interest and wore an expression of innocent wonder,
not unmingled with delight. She nodded merrily to me when I
looked up and laid a finger against her lips, as if to warn me to
silence. Disgusted, I withdrew my eyes hastily from hers. Indeed,
after my experience of the previous evening, I did not care to
trust my self-control under the influence of her gaze.</p>

<p>As Dr. Mack with his sharp scissors cut the end of a linen
bandage, he whispered to me: "This is without a parallel. Not a
sign of syncope, no trace of functional disorder. She has dropped
quietly into healthy sleep during an infliction of pain that
would drive a strong man mad."</p>

<p>As soon as released from my duties in the lecture room, I made
my way to the roof of the building. As I emerged through the
scuttle-way, Miss Borgier scrambled to her feet and advanced to
meet me without manifesting the slightest discomposure. Her face
fairly beamed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it beautiful?" she asked with a smile, extending her
hand. "I heard the bones slowly grinding and crushing!"</p>

<p>I did not take her hand. "How came you here?" I demanded,
avoiding her glance.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said she, with a silvery laugh. "I came early, about
sunrise. The janitor left the door ajar and I slipped in while he
was in the cellar. All the morning I spent in the place where
they dissect; and when the students began to come in downstairs I
escaped here to the roof."</p>

<p>"Are you aware, Miss Borgier," I asked, very gravely, "that
you have committed a serious indiscretion, and must be gotten out
of the building as quickly and privately as possible?"</p>

<p>She did not appear to understand. "Very well," she said. "I
suppose there is nothing more to see. I may as well go."</p>

<p>I led her down through the garret, cumbered with boxes and
barrels of unarticulated human bones; through the medical
library, unoccupied at that hour; by a back stairway into and
across the great vacant chemical lecture room; through the
anatomical cabinet, full of objects appalling to the imagination
of her sex. I was silent and she said nothing; but her eyes were
everywhere, drinking in the strange surroundings with an avidity
which I could feel without once looking at her. Finally we came
to a basement corridor, at the end of which a door, not often
used, gave egress by an alleyway to the street. It was through
this door that subjects for dissection were brought into the
building. I took a bunch of keys from my pocket and turned the
lock. "Your way is clear now," I said.</p>

<p>To my immense astonishment, Miss Borgier, as we stood together
at the end of the dark corridor, threw both arms around my neck
and kissed me.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she said, as she disappeared through the
half-opened door.</p>

<p>When I awoke the next morning, after sleeping for more than
fifteen hours, I found that I could not raise my head from the
pillow without nausea. The symptoms were exactly like those which
mark the effects of an overdose of laudanum.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
I HAVE thought it due to myself and to my professional
reputation to recount these facts before briefly speaking of my
recent testimony as an expert, in the Ratcliff murder trial, the
character of my relations with the accused having been
persistently misrepresented.</p>

<p>The circumstances of that celebrated case are no doubt still
fresh in the recollection of the public. Mr. John L. Ratcliff, a
wealthy, middle-aged merchant of Boston, came to St. Louis with
his young bride, on their wedding journey. His sudden death at
the Planters' Hotel, followed by the arrest of his wife, who was
entirely without friends or acquaintances in the city, her
indictment for murder by poisoning, the conflict of medical
testimony at the trial, and the purely circumstantial nature of
the evidence against the prisoner, attracted general attention
and excited public interest to a degree that was quite
extraordinary.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the state proved that the relations
of Mr. and Mrs. Ratcliff, as observed by the guests and servants
of the hotel, were not felicitous; that he rarely spoke to her at
table, habitually averting his face in her presence; that he
wandered aimlessly about the hotel for several days previous to
his illness, apparently half stupefied, as if by the oppression
of some heavy mental burden, and that when accosted by anyone
connected with the house he started as if from a dream, and
answered incoherently if at all.</p>

<p>It was also shown that, by her husband's death, Mrs. Ratcliff
became the sole mistress of a large fortune.</p>

<p>The evidence bearing directly upon the circumstances of Mr.
Ratcliff's death was very clear. For twenty-four hours before a
physician was summoned, no one had access to him save his wife.
At dinner that day, in response to the polite inquiry of a lady
neighbor at table, Mrs. Ratcliff announced, with great
self-possession, that her husband was seriously indisposed. Soon
after eleven o'clock at night, Mrs. Ratcliff rang her bell, and,
without the least agitation of manner, remarked that her husband
appeared to be dying, and that it might be well to send for a
physician. Dr. Culbert, who arrived within a very few minutes,
found Mr. Ratcliff in a profound stupor, breathing stertorously.
He swore at the trial that when he first entered the room the
prisoner, pointing to the bed, coolly said, "I suppose that I
have killed him."</p>

<p>Dr. Culbert's testimony seemed to point unmistakably to
poisoning by laudanum or morphine. The unconscious man's pulse
was full but slow; his skin cold and pallid; the expression of
his countenance placid, yet ghastly pale; lips livid. Coma had
already supervened, and it was impossible to rouse him. The
ordinary expedients were tried in vain. Flagellation of the palms
of his hands and the soles of his feet, electricity applied to
the head and spine, failed to make any impression on his
lethargy. The eyelids being forcibly opened, the pupils were seen
to be contracted to the size of pinheads, and violently turned
inward. Later, the stertorous breathing developed into the
ominously loud rattle of mucous in the trachea; there were
convulsions, attended by copious frothings at the mouth; the
under jaw fell upon the breast; and paralysis and death followed,
four hours after Dr. Culbert's arrival.</p>

<p>Several of the most eminent practitioners of the city, put
upon the stand by the prosecution, swore that, in their opinion,
the symptoms noted by Dr. Culbert not only indicated opium
poisoning, but could have resulted from no other cause.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the state absolutely failed to show either
that opium in any form had been purchased by Mrs. Ratcliff in St.
Louis, or that traces of opium in any form were found in the room
after the event. It is true that the prosecuting attorney, in his
closing argument, sought to make the latter circumstance tell
against the prisoner. He argued that the disappearance of any
vessel containing or having contained laudanum, in view of the
positive evidence that laudanum had been employed, served to
establish a deliberate intention of murder and to demolish any
theory of accidental poisoning that the defense might attempt to
build; and he propounded half a dozen hypothetical methods by
which Mrs. Ratcliff might have disposed, in advance, of this
evidence of her crime. The court, of course, in summing up,
cautioned the jury against attaching weight to these hypotheses
of the prosecuting attorney.</p>

<p>The court, however, put much emphasis on the medical testimony
for the prosecution, and on the calm declaration of Mrs. Ratcliff
to Dr. Culbert, "I suppose that I have killed him."</p>

<p>Having conducted the autopsy, and afterward made a qualitative
analysis of the contents of the dead man's stomach, I was put
upon the stand as a witness for the defense.</p>

<p>Then I saw the prisoner for the first time in more than five
years. When I had taken the oath and answered the preliminary
questions, Mrs. Ratcliff raised the veil which she had worn since
the trial began, and looked me in the face with the
well-remembered eyes of Miss Borgier.</p>

<p>I confess that my behavior during the first few moments of
surprise afforded some ground for the reports that were afterward
current concerning my relations with the prisoner. Her eyes
chained not only mine, but my tongue also. I saw Jerusalem again,
and the face framed in blue sky peering down into the
amphitheater of the old medical college. It was only after a
struggle which attracted the attention of judge, jury, bar, and
spectators that I was able to proceed with my testimony.</p>

<p>That testimony was strong for the accused. My knowledge of the
case was wholly post-mortem. It began with the autopsy. Nothing
had been found that indicated poisoning by laudanum or by any
other agent. There was no morbid appearance of the intestinal
canal; no fullness of the cerebral vessels, no serous effusion.
Every appearance that would have resulted from death by poison
was wanting in the subject. That, of course, was merely negative
evidence. But, furthermore, my chemical analysis had proved the
absence of the poison in the system. The opium odor could not be
detected. I had tested for morphine with nitric acid, permuriate
of iron, chromate of potash, and, most important of all, iodic
acid. I had tested again for meconic acid with the permuriate of
iron. I had tested by Lassaigne's process, by Dublane's, and by
Flandin's. As far as the resources of organic chemistry could
avail, I had proved that, notwithstanding the symptoms of Mr.
Ratcliff's case before death, death had not resulted from
laudanum or any other poison known to science.</p>

<p>The questions by the prosecuting counsel as to my previous
acquaintance with the prisoner, I was able to answer truthfully
in a manner that did not shake the force of my medical testimony.
And it was chiefly on the strength of this testimony that the
jury, after a short deliberation, returned a verdict of not
guilty.</p>

<p>Did I swear falsely? No; for science bore me out in every
assertion. I knew that not a drop of laudanum or a grain of
morphine had passed Ratcliff's lips. Ought I to have declared my
belief regarding the true cause of the man's death, and told the
story of my previous observations of Miss Borgier's case? No; for
no court of justice would have listened to that story for a
single moment. I knew that the woman did not murder her husband.
Yet I believed and knew&mdash;as surely as we can know anything
where the basis of ascertained fact is slender and the laws
obscure&mdash;that she poisoned him, poisoned him to death with
her eyes.</p>

<p>I think that it will be generally conceded by the profession
that I am neither a sensationalist nor prone to lose my
self-command in the mazes of physico-psychologic speculation. I
make the foregoing assertion deliberately, fully conscious of all
that it implies.</p>

<p>What was the mystery of the noxious influence which this woman
exerted through her eyes? What was the record of her ancestry,
the secret of predisposition in her case? By what occult process
of evolution did her glance derive the toxical effect of the
<i>papaver somniferum</i>? How did she come to be a
Woman&mdash;Poppy? I cannot yet answer these questions. Perhaps I
shall never be able to answer them.</p>

<p>But if there is need of further proof of the sincerity of my
denial of any sentiment on my part which might have led me to
shield Mrs. Ratcliff by perjury, I may say that I have now in my
possession a letter from her, written after her acquittal,
proposing to endow me with her fortune and herself; as well as a
copy of my reply, respectfully declining the offer.</p>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>11. --THE STORY OF THE DELUGE</h2>

<h3>THE REMARKABLE DISCOVERIES OF MR. GEORGE SMITH</h3>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 29 April 1875</h3>

<p class="chaphead">
Interesting Particulars Respecting the Translations of the
Assyrian Tablets in the British Museum&mdash;Newly Discovered
Facts About the Flood and Noah, Together with Some Light on the
History of the Senator from Maine and the Settlement of
Brooklyn.</p>
<br>

<p class="first">
BOSTON, April 26&mdash; Mr. Jacob Rounds of London, one of
the assistant curators of the British Museum, in a private letter
to a distinguished Orientalist of this city, gives some
interesting particulars regarding the progress which has been
made in the arrangement and translation of the sculptured tablets
and <i>lateres coctiles</i> brought from Assyria and Chaldea by
Mr. George Smith. The results of the past three or four months
are gratifying in the extreme. The work, which was begun three
quarters of a century ago by Grotefend, and pursued by
archaeologists such as Rask, St. Martin, Klaproth, Oppert, and
the indefatigable Rawlinson, each of whom was satisfied if he
carried it forward a single step, has been pushed far and fast by
Mr. George Smith and his scholarly associates. The
Assyrio-Babylonian cuneiforms, the third and most complicated
branch of the trilogy, may fairly be said to have found their
Oedipus.</p>

<p>The riddles of Accad and of Sumir are read at last. The
epigraphs on tablets dug from the earth and rubbish of the
Ninevite mounds are now translated by Mr. George Smith as readily
as Professor Whitney translates Greek, or a fifth-term schoolboy,
the fable of the man and the viper.</p>

<p>It is not many years since the learned Witte declared that
these sphenographic characters, arranged so neatly upon the slabs
of gray alabaster, or the carefully prepared surface of
clay&mdash;like specimen arrowheads in the museum of some ancient
war department&mdash;were entirely without alphabetic
significance, mere whimsical ornaments, or perhaps the trail of
worms! But their exegesis has been perfected. The mounds of
Nimroud, and Kouyunjik, and Khorsabad, and Nebbi Yunus have
yielded up their precious treasures, and are now revealing, page
by page, the early history of our globe.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith and Mr. Rounds are both confirmed in the belief,
first entertained by Westergaarde, that the cuneiform character
is closely akin to the Egyptian demotic; and also that its
alphabet&mdash;which contains over four hundred signs, some
syllable, some phonetic, and some ideographic&mdash;is of the
most complicated and arbitrary nature. As already intimated, the
inscriptions which Mr. Smith and his co-laborers have deciphered
are in the primitive or Babylonian character, which is much more
obscure than either of its successors and modifications, the
so-called Persian and Median <i>cunei</i>.</p>

<h3>SENNACHERIB'S LIBRARY</h3>

<p class="first">
THE slabs of the greatest interest and importance were those
found buried in the famous Kouyunjik mound, first opened in 1843
by M. Paul Emile Botta, and subsequently explored by Layard
himself.</p>

<p>The inscriptions are mostly upon clay, and seem to have
constituted the walls of the great library of Assurbanipal in
Sennacherib's palace. Sennacherib was probably a monarch of a
nautical turn of mind, for a large portion of the inscriptions
illustrate the history of the flood and the voyage of Noah, or of
Nyab, his Assyrian counterpart, who also corresponds, in some
particulars, with the Deucalion of the Grecian myths. Piece by
piece and fragment by fragment the diluvian narrative has been
worked out, until it stands complete, a distinct episode in the
vast epic which Mr. George Smith is engaged in reconstructing.
Mr. Rounds may certainly be pardoned for the naturally
enthusiastic terms in which he speaks of these labors.</p>

<p>And well may he be proud. These men in the British Museum are
successfully compiling, brick by brick, what they claim to be a
complete encyclopedia of sacred and profane history, beginning
with the conception of matter and the birth of mind. Their
extraordinary researches have placed them upon a pedestal of
authority, from which they now gravely pronounce their approval
of the Holy Scriptures, and even stoop to pat Moses on the head
and to tell him that his inspired version was very nearly
correct.</p>

<p>So graphic is the account of the adventures of Nyab, or Noah
as he may more conveniently be called; so clear is the synopsis
of his method of navigation; so startling are the newly
discovered facts regarding the Ark and its passengers, that I am
tempted to avail myself of the kind permission of the Boston
savant who has the honor to be Mr. Rounds's esteemed
correspondent, and to transcribe somewhat in detail, for the
benefit of your readers, the extraordinary story of the flood as
told by the Assyrian cuneiforms&mdash;cryptograms for four
thousand years until the genius of a Smith unveiled the mystery
of their meaning.</p>

<h3>THE RISING OF THE WATERS</h3>

<p class="first">
MR. SMITH ascertains from these inscriptions that when Noah
began to build his Ark and prophesy a deluge, the prevailing
opinion was that he was either a lunatic or a shrewd speculator
who proposed, by his glowing predictions and appearance of
perfect sincerity, so to depreciate real estate that he might
buy, through his brokers, to any extent at prices merely
nominal.</p>

<p>Even after the lowlands were submerged, and it was apparent
that there was to be a more than usually wet season, Noah's
wicked neighbors were accustomed to gather for no other purpose
than to deride the ungainly architecture of the Ark and to
question its sailing qualities. They were not wanting who
asserted that the Thing would roll over at the first puff of wind
like a too heavily freighted tub. So people came from far and
near to witness and laugh at the discomfiture of the aged
patriarch.</p>

<p>But there was no occasion for ridicule. The Ark floated like a
cork. Noah dropped his center board and stood at the helm waving
graceful adieus to his wicked contemporaries, while the good
vessel caught a fresh southerly breeze and moved on like a thing
of life. There is nothing whatever in the Assyrian account to
confirm the tradition that Noah accelerated the motion of the Ark
by raising his own coattails. This would have been an unnecessary
as well as undignified proceeding. The tall house on deck
afforded sufficient resistance to the wind to drive the Ark along
at a very respectable rate of speed.</p>

<h3>NOAH AS A NAVIGATOR</h3>

<p class="first">
AFTER the first novelty of the situation had worn off, and
there was no longer the satisfaction of kindly but firmly
refusing applications for passage, and seeing the lately derisive
people scrambling for high land, only to be eventually caught by
and swallowed up in the roaring waters, the voyage was a
vexatious and disagreeable one. The Ark at the best was an
unwieldy craft. She fell off from the wind frightfully, and
almost invariably missed stays. Every choppy sea hammered roughly
upon her flat bottom, making all on board so seasick as to wish
that they too had been wicked, and sunk with the crowd.</p>

<p>Inside the miserable shanty which served for a cabin, birds,
beasts, and human beings were huddled promiscuously together. One
of the deluge tablets says, not without a touch of pathos: "It
was extremely uncomfortable <i>[amakharsyar]</i> to sleep with a
Bengal tiger glaring at one from a corner, and a hedgehog nestled
up close against one's bare legs. But it was positively dangerous
when the elephant became restless, or the polar bear took offense
at some fancied slight."</p>

<p>I will not anticipate Mr. Smith's detailed account of the
cruise of the Ark. He has gathered data for a complete chart of
Noah's course during the many months of the voyage. The tortuous
nature of the route pursued and the eccentricity of Noah's great
circle sailing are proof that the venerable navigator, under the
depressing influence of his surroundings, had frequent recourse
to ardent spirits, an infirmity over which we, his descendants,
should drop the veil of charity and of silence.</p>

<h3>EXTRACT FROM NOAH'S LOG</h3>

<p class="first">
THE most astounding discovery of all, however, is a batch of
tablets giving an actual and literal transcript from Noah's
logbook. The journal of the voyage&mdash;which Noah, as a prudent
navigator, doubtless kept with considerable care&mdash;was
probably bequeathed to Shem, eldest born and executive officer of
the Ark. Portions of the log, it may be, were handed down from
generation to generation among the Semitic tribes; and Mr. Rounds
does not hesitate to express his opinion that these tablets in
the British Museum were copied directly from the original entries
made in the ship's book by Noah or Shem.</p>

<p>He sends to his Boston correspondent early proofs of some of
the lithographic facsimiles which are to illustrate Mr. Smith's
forthcoming work, An Exhaustive History of the Flood and of the
Noachic Voyage. They should bear in mind that the inscription
reads from left to right, and not, like Arabic and numerous other
Semitic languages, from right to left.</p>

<p>Expressed in the English character, this inscription would
read as follows:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
<i>...dahyarva saka ormudzi...fraharram athura uvatish...kia
rich thyar avalna nyasadayram okanaus mana frabara ...gathava
Hambl Hamin khaysathryam nam Buhmi...pasara ki hi baga Jethyths
paruvnam oazarka... Rhsayarsha ...</i></p>

<br>

<p>Such progress has been made in the interpretation of the
Aramaic dialects that it is comparatively an easy matter for Mr.
Rounds to put this into our vernacular, which he does as follows,
supplying certain hiatuses to the inscription where the
connection is obvious:</p>

<br>

<p class="quote">
<i>SCOW "AHK," LATITUDE 44° 15', LONGITUDE... Water falling
rapidly. Ate our last pterodactyl yesterday... Hambl Hamin
[Hannibal Hamlin!] down with scurvy. Must put him ashore... THURS, 7TH. Bitter ale and mastodons all gone. Mrs. Japheth's had
another pair of twins. All well.</i></p>

<br>

<p>The importance of this scrap of diluvian history can hardly be
overestimated. It throws light on three or four points which have
been little understood hitherto. Having viewed the subject in all
its bearings, and having compared the extract here quoted with
numberless other passages which I have not time to give, Mr.
Smith and Mr. Rounds arrive at the following</p>

<h3>IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS</h3>

<p class="first">
I. When this entry was made in the logbook by Noah (or Shem )
the Ark was somewhere off the coast of Maine. The latitude
warrants this inference; the longitude is unfortunately wanting.
Parallel proof that Noah visited the shores of North America is
to be found in the old ballad, founded on a Rabbinical tradition,
where mention is made of Barnegat. The singular error which
locates Ararat just three miles south of Barnegat is doubtless
due to some confusion in Noah's logarithms&mdash;the natural
result of his unfortunate personal habits.</p>

<p class="first">
II. "Ate our last pterodactyl yesterday...Bitter ale and
mastodons all gone." There we have a simple solution of a problem
which has long puzzled science. The provisions stowed away in the
Ark did not prove sufficient for the unexpectedly protracted
voyage. Hard-pressed for food, Noah and his family were obliged
to fall back on the livestock. They devoured the larger and more
esculent animals in the collection. The only living specimens of
the icthyosaurus, the dodo, the silurian, the pleisosaurus, the
mastodon, were eaten up by the hungry excursionists. We can
therefore explain the extinction of certain species, which, as
geology teaches us, existed in antediluvian times. Were this
revelation the only result of Mr. Smith's researches he would not
have dug in vain. Mr. Rounds justly observes that the allusion to
bitter ale affords strong presumptive evidence that this entry in
the log was made by the hand of no other than Noah himself!</p>

<p class="first">
III. The allusion to the interesting increase of Japheth's
family shows that woman&mdash;noble woman, who always rises to
the occasion&mdash;was doing her utmost to repair the breaches
made in the earth's population by the whelming waters. The phrase
<i>hi baga</i> may possibly signify triplets; but Mr. Smith, with
that conservatism and repugnance to sensation which ever
characterize the true archaeologist, prefers to be on the safe
side and call it twins.</p>

<h3>HANNIBAL HAMLIN THE ORIGINAL HAM</h3>

<p class="first">
IV. We now come to a conclusion which is as startling as it is
inevitable. It connects the Honorable Hannibal Hamlin with the
diluvian epoch, and thus with the other long-lived patriarchs who
flourished before the flood. Antiquarians have long suspected
that the similarity between the names Ham and Hamlin was
something more than a coincidence. The industry of a Smith has
discovered among the Assyrian ruins the medial link which makes
the connection perfectly apparent. Ham, the second son of Noah,
is spoken of in these records from Kouyunjik as Hambl Hamin; and
no candid mind can fail to see that the extreme antiquity of the
senator from Maine is thus very clearly established!</p>

<p>"Hambl Hamin down with the scurvy. Must put him ashore." Buhmi
literally signifies earth, dirt: and the phrase <i>nam Buhmi</i>
is often used in these inscriptions in the sense of to put in the
earth, or bury. This can hardly be the meaning here, however, for
the Ark was still afloat. Nam Buhmi can therefore hardly be
construed otherwise than "put ashore."</p>

<p>Note the significance. The Ark is beating up and down, off the
coast of Maine, waiting for a nor'west wind. Poor Ham, or Hambl
Hamin, as he should properly be called, has reason to regret his
weakness for maritime excursions and naval junketing parties. The
lack of fresh vegetables, and a steady diet of corned mastodon,
have told upon his system. Poor Hambl! When he was collector of a
Mediterranean port just before the flood, he was accustomed to
have green peas and asparagus franked him daily from the Garden
of Eden. But now the franking privilege has been abrogated, and
the Garden of Eden is full forty fathoms under the brine.
Everything is salt. His swarthy face grows pale and haggard. His
claw-hammer coat droops upon an attenuated frame. He chews his
cheroot moodily as he stands upon the hurricane deck of the Ark
with his thumbs in his vest pocket, and thinks that he can hold
office on this earth but little longer. His gums begin to soften.
He shows the ravages of the scurvy. And Noah, therefore, after
considerable argument&mdash;for Hambl is reluctant to get out of
any place he has once got into&mdash;nam Buhmi's him&mdash;puts
him ashore.</p>

<p>We have no further record of Hambl Hamin, but it is perfectly
reasonable to assume that after being landed on the rocky coast
of Maine he subsisted upon huckleberries until sufficiently
recovered from the scurvy, then sailed up the Penobscot upon a
log, founded the ancient village of Hamden, which he named after
himself, and was immediately elected to some public position.</p>

<h3>AN OPPOSITION ARK</h3>

<p class="first">
IN Mr. Rounds's long and profoundly interesting communication
I have, I fear, an <i>embarras de richesses</i>. From the many
curious legends which Mr. Smith has deciphered, I shall select
only one more, and shall deal briefly with that. It is the story
of an opposition ark.</p>

<p>At the time of the flood there lived a certain merchant named
Brith, who had achieved a competence in the retail grocery
business. In fact, he was an antediluvian millionaire. Brith had
been converted from heathenism by the exceedingly effective
preaching of Noah, but had subsequently backslidden. When it
began to thunder and lighten, however, and to grow black in the
northeast, Brith professed recurring symptoms of piety. He came
down to the gangway plank and applied for passage for himself and
family. Noah, who was checking off the animals on the back of an
old tax bill, sternly refused to entertain any such idea. Brith
had recently defeated him for the Common Council.</p>

<p>The worthy grocer's money now stood him in good stead. He did
the most sensible thing possible under the circumstances. He
built an ark for himself, painted in big letters along the side
the words: "The Only Safe Plan of Universal Navigation!" and
named it the <i>Toad</i>. The <i>Toad</i> was fashioned after the
model of the Ark, and there being no copyright in those days,
Noah could only hope that it might prove unseaworthy.</p>

<p>In the <i>Toad</i>, Brith embarked his wife Briatha, his two
daughters, Phessar and Barran, his sons-in-law, Lampra and
Pinnyish, and a select assortment of beasts hardly inferior to
that collected by Noah himself. Lampra and Pinnyish, sly dogs,
persuaded fifty of the most beautiful women they could find to
come along with them.</p>

<p>Brith was not so good a sailor as Noah. He put to sea full
forty days too soon. He lost his dead reckoning and beat around
the ocean for the space of seven years and a quarter, living
mostly upon the rats that infested the <i>Toad</i>. Brith had
foolishly neglected to provision his craft for a long voyage.</p>

<p>After this protracted sailing, the passengers and crew of the
<i>Toad</i> managed to make a landing one rainy evening and took
ashore, with themselves, their baggage and a coon and dromedary,
the sole surviving relics of their proud menagerie. Once on
<i>terra firma</i>, the three men separated, having drawn up a
tripartite covenant of perpetual amity and divided up the stock
of wives. Brith took eighteen, Lampra took eighteen, and
Pinnyish, who seems to have been an easygoing sort of fellow, too
lazy to quarrel, had to be satisfied with the seventeen that
remained.</p>

<p>Tablets from Nebbi Yunus throw some light on the interesting
question as to the landing place of this party. Khayarta
certainly means island, and Dyinim undeniably signifies long.
Perhaps, therefore, Mr. Rounds is justified in his opinion that
the <i>Toad</i> dropped anchor in Wallabout Bay, and that
Brooklyn and the Plymouth society owe their origin to this
singular expedition.</p>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>12. &mdash; THE PROFESSOR'S EXPERIMENT</h2>

<h3>Published in the New York <i>Sun</i>, 22 February 1880</h3>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="first">
THE red wine of Affenthal has this quality, that one
half-bottle makes you kind but firm, two make you talkative and
obstinate, and three, recklessly unreasonable.</p>

<p>If the waiter at the Prinz Carl in Heidelberg had possessed a
soul above drink-money, he might have calculated accurately the
effect of the six half-bottles of Affenthaler which he fetched to
the apartment of the Reverend Dr. Bellglory at the six o'clock
dinner for three. That is to say, he might have deduced this
story in advance by observation of the fact that of the six
half-bottles one was consumed by Miss Blanche Bellglory, two went
to the Reverend Doctor, her father, while the remaining moiety
fell to the share of young Strout, remotely of New York and
immediately of Professor Schwank's psycho-neurological section in
the university.</p>

<p>So when in the course of the evening the doctor fell asleep in
his chair, and young Strout took opportunity to put to Miss
Blanche a question which he had already asked her twice, once at
Saratoga Springs and once in New York city, she returned the
answer he had heard on two former occasions, but in terms even
more firm, while not less kind than before. She declared her
unalterable determination to abide by her parent's wishes.</p>

<p>This was not exactly pleasing to young Strout. He knew better
than anybody else that, while approving him socially and humanly,
the doctor abhorred his opinions. "No man," the doctor had
repeatedly said, "who denies the objective verity of knowledge
derived from intuition or otherwise by subjective
methods&mdash;no man who pushes noumena aside in his impetuous
pursuit of phenomena can make a safe husband for my child."</p>

<p>He said the same thing again in a great many words and with
much emphasis, after he awoke from his nap, Miss Blanche having
discreetly withdrawn.</p>

<p>"But, my dear Doctor," urged Strout, "this is an affair of the
heart, not of metaphysics; and you leave for Nuremberg tomorrow,
and now is my last chance."</p>

<p>"You are an excellent young man in several respects," rejoined
the doctor. "Abjure your gross materialism and Blanche is yours
with all my heart. Your antecedents are unexceptionable, but you
are intellectually impregnated with the most dangerous heresy of
this or any other age. If I should countenance it by giving you
my daughter, I could never look the Princeton faculty in the
face."</p>

<p>"It appears to me that this doesn't concern the Princeton
faculty in the least," persisted Strout. "It concerns Blanche and
me."</p>

<p>Here, then, were three people, two of them young and in love
with each other, divided by a question of metaphysics, the most
abstract and useless question that ever wasted human effort. But
that same question divided the schools of Europe for centuries
and contributed largely to the list of martyrs for opinion's
sake. The famous old controversy was now taken up by the six
half-bottles of Affenthaler, three of them stoutly holding ground
against the other three.</p>

<p>"No argument in the world," said the doctor's two
half-bottles, "can shake my decision;" and off he went to sleep
again.</p>

<p>"No amount of coaxing," said Miss Blanche's half-bottle, two
hours later in the evening, "can make me act contrary to Papa's
wishes. But," continued the half-bottle in a whisper, "I am sorry
he is so stubborn."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," retorted Strout's three half-bottles.
"You have no more heart than one of your father's
non-individualized ideas. You are not real flesh and blood like
other women. You are simply Extension, made up of an aggregate of
concepts, and assuming to be Entity, and imposing your unreal
existence upon a poor Devil like me. You are unreal, I say. A
flaw in logic, an error of the senses, a fallacy in reasoning, a
misplaced premise, and what becomes of you? Puff! Away you go
into all. If it were otherwise, you would care for me. What a
fool I am to love you! I might as well love a memory, a thought,
a dream, a mathematical formula, a rule of syntax, or anything
else that lacks objective existence."</p>

<p>She said nothing, but the tears came into her eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Blanche," he continued at the door, pulling his hat
over his eyes and not observing the look of pain and bewilderment
that clouded her fair face&mdash;"Heaven bless you when your
father finally marries you to a syllogism!"</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="first">
STROUT went whistling from the Prinz Carl Hotel toward his
rooms in the Plöckstrasse. He reviewed his parting with Blanche.
"So much the better, perhaps," he said to himself. "One dream
less in life, and more room for realities." By the clock in the
market place he saw that it was half-past nine, for the full moon
hanging high above the Königstuhl flooded the town and valley
with light. Up on the side of the hill the gigantic ruin of the
old castle stood boldly out from among the trees.</p>

<p>He stopped whistling and gritted his teeth.</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" he said aloud, "one can't take off his convictions
like a pair of uncomfortable boots. After all, love is nothing
more nor less than the disintegration and recombination of
certain molecules of the brain or marrow, the exact laws
governing which have not yet been ascertained." So saying, he ran
plump into a portly individual coming down the street.</p>

<p>"Hallo! Herr Strout," said the jolly voice of Professor
Schwank. "Whither are you going so fast, and what kind of
physiology talk you to the moon?"</p>

<p>"I am walking off three half-bottles of your cursed
Affenthaler, which have gone to my feet, Herr Professor," replied
Strout, "and I am making love to the moon. It's an old affair
between us."</p>

<p>"And your lovely American friend?" demanded the fat professor,
with a chuckle.</p>

<p>"Departs by the morning train," replied Strout gravely.</p>

<p><i>"Himmelblitzen!"</i> exclaimed the professor. "And grief
has blinded you so that you plunge into the abdomens of your
elders? But come with me to my room, and smoke yourself into a
philosophic frame of mind."</p>

<p>Professor Schwank's apartments faced the university buildings
in the Ludwigplatz. Established in a comfortable armchair, with a
pipe of excellent tobacco in his mouth, Strout felt more at peace
with his environment. He was now in an atmosphere of healthful,
practical, scientific activity that calmed his soul. Professor
Schwank had gone further than the most eminent of his
contemporaries in demonstrating the purely physiological basis of
mind and thought. He had gotten nearer than any other man in
Europe to the secrets of the nerve aura, the penetralia of the
brain, the memory scars of the ganglia. His position in
philosophy was the antipodes of that occupied by the Reverend Dr.
Bellglory, for example. The study reflected the occupations of
the man. In one corner stood an enormous Ruhmkorff coil. Books
were scattered everywhere&mdash;on shelves, on tables, on chairs,
on the floor. A plaster bust of Aristotle looked across the room
into the face of a plaster bust of Leibnitz. Prints of Gall, of
Pappenheim, of Leeuwenhoek, hung upon the walls. Varnished
dissections and wet preparations abounded. In a glass vessel on
the table at Strout's elbow, the brain of a positivist
philosopher floated in yellow alcohol: near it, also suspended in
spirits, swung the medulla oblongata of a celebrated thief.</p>

<p>The appearance of the professor himself, as he sat in his
armchair opposite Strout, serenely drawing clouds of smoke from
the amber mouthpiece of his long porcelain pipe, was of the sort
which, by promising sympathy beforehand, seduces reserve into
confidential utterances. Not only his rosy face, with its fringe
of yellow beard, but his whole mountainous body seemed to beam on
Strout with friendly good will. He looked like the refuge of a
broken heart. Drawn out in spite of himself by the professor's
kindly, attentive smile and discreet questions, Strout found
satisfaction in unbosoming his troubles. The professor, smoking
in silence, listened patiently to the long story. If Strout had
been less preoccupied with his own woes he might, perhaps, have
discovered that behind the friendly interest that glimmered on
the glasses of the professor's gold-bowed spectacles, a pair of
small, steel-gray eyes were observing him with the keen,
unrelenting coldness of scientific scrutiny.</p>

<p>"You have seen, Herr Professor," said Strout in conclusion,
"that the case is hopeless."</p>

<p>"My dear fellow," replied the professor, "I see nothing of the
kind."</p>

<p>"But it is a matter of conviction," explained Strout. "One
cannot renounce the truth even to gain a wife. She herself would
despise me if I did."</p>

<p>"In this world everything is true and nothing is true,"
replied the professor sententiously. "You must change your
convictions."</p>

<p>"That is impossible!"</p>

<p>The professor blew a great cloud of smoke and regarded the
young man with an expression of pity and surprise. It seemed to
Strout that Aristotle and Leibnitz, Leeuwenhoek, Pappenheim, and
Gall were all looking down upon him with pity and surprise.</p>

<p>"Impossible did you say?" remarked Professor Schwank. "On the
contrary, my dear boy, nothing is easier than to change one's
convictions. In the present advanced condition of surgery, it is
a matter of little difficulty."</p>

<p>Strout looked at his respected instructor in blank amazement.
"What you call your convictions," continued the savant, "are
matters of mental constitution, depending on adventitious
circumstances. You are a positivist, an idealist, a skeptic, a
mystic, a what-not, why? Because nature, predisposition, the
assimilation of bony elements, have made your skull thicker in
one place, thinner in another. The cranial wall presses too close
upon the brain in one spot; you sneer at the opinions of your
friend, Dr. Bellglory. It cramps the development of the tissues
in another spot; you deny faith a place in philosophy. I assure
you, Herr Strout, we have discovered and classified already the
greater part of the physical causes determining and limiting
belief, and are fast reducing the system to the certainty of
science."</p>

<p>"Granting all that," interposed Strout, whose head was
swimming under the combined influence of Affenthaler, tobacco
smoke, and startling new ideas, "I fail to see how it helps my
case. Unfortunately, the bone of my skull is no longer cartilage,
like an infant's. You cannot mold my intellect by means of
compresses and bandages."</p>

<p>"Ah! there you touch my professional pride," cried Schwank.
"If you would only put yourself into my hands!"</p>

<p>"And what then?"</p>

<p>"Then," replied the professor with enthusiasm, "I should
remodel your intellect to suit the emergency. How, you ask? If a
blow on the head had driven a splinter of bone down upon the gray
matter overlaying the cerebrum, depriving you of memory, the
power of language, or some other special faculty, as the case
might be, how should I proceed? I should raise a section of the
bone and remove the pressure. Just so when the physical
conformation of the cranium limits your capacity to understand
and credit the philosophy which your American theologian insists
upon in his son-in-law. I remove the pressure. I give you a
charming wife, while science gains a beautiful and valuable fact.
That is what I offer you, Herr Strout!"</p>

<p>"In other words&mdash;" began Strout.</p>

<p>"In other words, I should trephine you," shouted the
professor, jumping from his chair and no longer attempting to
conceal his eagerness.</p>

<p>"Well, Herr Professor," said Strout slowly, after a long
pause, during which he had endeavored to make out why the
pictured face of Gall seemed to wear a look of triumph
"&mdash;Well, Herr Professor, I consent to the operation.
Trephine me at once&mdash;tonight."</p>

<p>The professor feebly demurred to the precipitateness of this
course. "The necessary preparations," he urged.</p>

<p>"Need not occupy five minutes," replied Strout. "Tomorrow I
shall have changed my mind."</p>

<p>This suggestion was enough to impel the professor to immediate
action. "You will allow me," asked he, "to send for my esteemed
colleague in the university, the Herr Dr. Anton Diggelmann?"</p>

<p>Strout assented. "Do anything that you think needful to the
success of the experiment."</p>

<p>Professor Schwank rang. "Fritz," said he to the stupid-faced
Black Forester who answered the bell, "run across the square and
ask Dr. Diggelmann to come to me immediately. Request him to
bring his surgical case and sulphuric ether. If you find the
doctor, you need not return."</p>

<p>Acting on a sudden impulse, Strout seized a sheet of paper
that lay on the professor's table and hastily wrote a few words.
"Here!" he said, tossing the servant a gold piece of ten marks.
"Deliver this note at the Prince Carl in the morning&mdash;mind
you, in the morning."</p>

<p>The note which he had written was this:</p>

<br>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">Blanche</span>:</p>

<p class="letter">When you receive this I shall have solved the
problem in one way or another. I am about to be trephined under
the superintendence of my friend Professor Schwank. If the
intellectual obstacle to our union is removed by the operation, I
shall follow you to Bavaria and Switzerland. If the operation
results otherwise, think sometimes kindly of your unfortunate</p>

<p class="letter"><span class="smcap">G.S.</span></p>

<p class="letter">Ludwigplatz; 10:30 p.m.</p>

<p><br>
Fritz faithfully delivered the message to Dr. Diggelmann, and
then hied toward the nearest wine shop. His gold piece dazed him.
"A nice, liberal gentleman that!" he thought. "Ten marks for
carrying the letter to the Prinz Carl in the morning&mdash;ten
marks, a thousand pfennig; beer at five pfennig the glass, two
hundred glasses!" The immensity of the prospect filled him with
joy. How might he manifest his gratitude? He reflected, and an
idea struck him. "I will not wait till morning," he thought. "I
will deliver the gentleman's letter tonight, at once. He will
say, 'Fritz, you are a prompt fellow. You do even better than you
are told.'"</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p class="first">
STROUT was stretched upon a reclining chair, his coat and
waistcoat off. Professor Schwank stood over him. In his hand was
a hollow cone, rolled from a newspaper. He held the cone by the
apex: the broad aperture at the base was closely pressed against
Strout's face, covering all but his eyes and forehead.</p>

<p>"By long, steady, regular inspiration," said the professor, in
a soothing, monotonous voice. "That is right; that is right; that
is&mdash;right&mdash;there&mdash;there&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>With every inhalation Strout drew in the pleasant, tingling
coldness of the ether fumes. At first his breathing was forced:
at the end of each inspiration he experienced for an instant a
sensation as if mighty waters were rushing through his brain.
Gradually the period of the rushing sensation extended itself,
until it began with the beginning of each breath. Then the ether
seemed to seize possession of his breathing, and to control the
expansions and contractions of his chest independently of his own
will. The ether breathed for him. He surrendered himself to its
influence with a feeling of delight. The rushings became
rhythmic, and the intervals shorter and shorter. His
individuality seemed to be wrapped up in the rushings, and to be
borne to and fro in their tremendous flux and reflux. "I shall be
gone in one second more," he thought, and his consciousness sank
in the whirling flood.</p>

<p>Professor Schwank nodded to Dr. Diggelmann. The doctor nodded
back to the professor.</p>

<p>Dr. Diggelmann was a dry little old man, who weighed hardly
more than a hundred pounds. He wore a black wig, too large for
his head. His eyes were deep set under corrugated brows, while
strongly marked lines running from the corners of his nostrils to
the corners of his mouth gave his face a lean, sardonic
expression, in striking contrast with the jolly rotundity of
Professor Schwank's visage. Dr. Diggelmann was taciturn but
observant. At the professor's nod, he opened his case of surgical
instruments and selected a scalpel with a keen curved blade, and
also a glittering piece of steel which looked like an exaggerated
auger bit with a gimlet handle. Having satisfied himself that
these instruments were in good condition, he deliberately rolled
up the sleeves of his coat and approached the unconscious
Strout.</p>

<p>"About on the median line, just behind the junction of the
corona' and sagittal sutures," whispered Professor Schwank
eagerly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I know&mdash;I know," replied Diggelmann.</p>

<p>He was on the point of cutting away with his scalpel some of
the brown hair that encumbered operations on the top of Strout's
head, when the door was quickly opened from the outside and a
young lady, attended by a maid, entered without ceremony.</p>

<p>"I am Blanche Bellglory," the young lady announced to the
astonished savants, as soon as she had recovered her breath. "I
have come to&mdash;"</p>

<p>At this moment she perceived the motionless form of Strout
upon the reclining chair, while the gleaming steel in Dr.
Diggelmann's hand caught her alert eyes. She uttered a little
shriek and ran toward the group.</p>

<p>"Oh, this is terrible!" she cried. "I am too late, and you
have already killed him."</p>

<p>"Calm yourself, I beg you," said the polite professor. "No
circumstance is terrible to which we are indebted for a visit
from so charming a young lady."</p>

<p>"So great an honor!" added Dr. Diggelmann, grinning
diabolically and rubbing his hands.</p>

<p>"And Herr Strout," continued the professor, "is unfortunately
not yet trephined. As you entered, we were about beginning the
operation."</p>

<p>Miss Bellglory gave a sob of relief and sank into a chair.</p>

<p>In a few well-chosen words the professor explained the theory
of his experiment, dwelling especially upon the effect it was
expected to have on the fortunes of the young people. When he
finished, the American girl's eyes were full of tears, but the
firm lines of her mouth showed that she had already resolved upon
her own course.</p>

<p>"How noble in him," she exclaimed, "to submit to be trephined
for my sake! But that must not be. I can't consent to have his
poor, dear head mutilated. I should never forgive myself. The
trouble all originates from my decision not to marry him without
Papa's approval. With my present views of duty, I cannot alter
that decision. But don't you think," she continued, dropping her
voice to a whisper, "that if you should trephine me, I might see
my duty in a different light?"</p>

<p>"It is extremely probable, my dear young lady," replied the
professor, throwing a significant glance at Dr. Diggelmann, who
responded with the faintest wink imaginable.</p>

<p>"Then," said Miss Blanche, arising and beginning to remove her
bonnet, "please proceed to trephine me immediately. I insist on
it."</p>

<p>"What's all this?" demanded the deep voice of the Reverend Dr.
Bellglory, who had entered the room unnoticed, piloted by Fritz.
"I came as rapidly as I could, Blanche, but not early enough, it
appears, to learn the first principles of your singular
actions."</p>

<p>"My papa, gentlemen," said Miss Bellglory.</p>

<p>The two Germans bowed courteously. Dr. Bellglory affably
returned their salutation.</p>

<p>"These gentlemen, Papa," Miss Blanche explained, "have kindly
undertaken to reconcile the difference of opinion between poor
George and ourselves by means of a surgical operation. I don't at
all understand it, but George does, for you see that he has
thought best to submit to the operation, which they were about to
begin when I arrived. Now, I cannot allow him to suffer for my
obstinacy; and, therefore, dear Papa, I have requested the
gentlemen to trephine me instead of him."</p>

<p>Professor Schwank repeated for Dr. Bellglory's information the
explanation which he had already made to the young lady. On
learning of Strout's course in the matter, Dr. Bellglory was
greatly affected.</p>

<p>"No, Blanche!" he said, "our young friend must not be
trephined. Although I cannot conscientiously accept him as a
son-in-law while our views on the verity of subjective knowledge
differ so widely, I can at least emulate his generous willingness
to open his intellect to conviction. It is I who will be
trephined, provided these gentlemen will courteously substitute
me for the patient now in their hands."</p>

<p>"We shall be most happy," said Professor Schwank and Dr.
Diggelman in the same breath.</p>

<p>"Thanks! Thanks!" cried Dr. Bellglory, with genuine
emotion.</p>

<p>"But I shall not permit you to sacrifice your lifelong
convictions to my happiness, Papa," interposed Blanche. The
doctor insisted that he was only doing his duty as a parent. The
amiable dispute went on for some time, the Germans listening with
indifference. Sure of a subject for their experiment at any rate,
they cared little which one of the three Americans finally came
under the knife. Meanwhile Strout opened his eyes, slowly raised
himself upon one elbow, vacantly gazed about the room for a few
seconds, and then sank back, relapsing temporarily into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Professor Schwank, who perceived that father and daughter were
equally fixed in their determination, and each unlikely to yield
to the other, was on the point of suggesting that the question be
settled by trephining both of them, when Strout again regained
his senses. He sat bolt upright, staring fixedly at the glass jar
which contained the positivist's brain. Then he pressed both
hands to his head, muttering a few incoherent words. Gradually,
as he recovered from the clutch of the ether one after another of
his faculties, his eyes brightened and he appeared to recognize
the faces around him. After some time he opened his lips and
spoke.</p>

<p>"Marvelous!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Miss Bellglory ran to him and took his hand. The doctor
hurried forward, intending to announce his own resolution to be
trephined. Strout pressed Blanche's hand to his lips for an
instant, gave the doctor's hand a cordial grasp, and then seized
the hand of Professor Schwank, which he wrung with all the warmth
of respectful gratitude.</p>

<p>"My dear Herr Professor," he said, "how can I ever repay you?
The experiment is a perfect success."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;" began the astounded professor.</p>

<p>"Don't try to depreciate your own share in my good fortune,"
interrupted Strout. "The theory was yours, and all the triumph of
the practical success belongs to you and Dr. Diggelmann's
skill."</p>

<p>Strout, still holding Blanche's hand, now turned to her
father.</p>

<p>"There is now no obstacle to our union, Doctor," he said.
"Thanks to Professor Schwank's operation, I see the blind folly
of my late attitude toward the subjective. I recant. I am no
longer a positivist. My intellect has leaped the narrow limits
that hedged it in. I know now that there is more in our
philosophy than can be measured with a metric ruler or weighed in
a coulomb balance. Ever since I passed under the influence of the
ether, I have been floating in the infinite. I have been freed
from conditions of time and space. I have lost my own
individuality in the immensity of the All. A dozen times I have
been absorbed in Brahma; a dozen times I have emanated from
Brahma, a new being, forgetful of my old self. I have stood face
to face with the mystic and awful Om; my world-soul, descending
to the finite, has floated calmly over an ocean of Affenthaler.
My consciousness leaped back as far as the thirtieth century
before Christ and forward as far as the fortieth century yet to
come. There is no time; there is no space; there is no individual
existence; there is nothing save the All, and the faith that
guides reason through the changeless night. For more than one
million years my identity was that of the positivist in the glass
jar yonder. Pardon me, Professor Schwank, but for the same period
of time yours was that of the celebrated thief in the other jar.
Great heavens! How mistaken I have been up to the night when you,
Herr Professor, took charge of my intellectual destiny."</p>

<p>He paused for want of breath, but the glow of the mystic's
rapture still lighted up his handsome features. There was an
awkward silence in the room for considerable time. Then it was
broken by the dry, harsh voice of Dr. Diggelmann.</p>

<p>"You labor under a somewhat ridiculous delusion, young
gentleman. You haven't been trephined yet."</p>

<p>Strout looked in amazement from one to another of his friends;
but their faces confirmed the surgeon's statement.</p>

<p>"What was it then?" he gasped.</p>

<p>"Sulphuric ether," replied the surgeon, laconically.</p>

<p>"But after all," interposed Dr. Bellglory, "it makes little
difference what agent has opened our friend's mind to a
perception of the truth. It is a matter for congratulation that
the surgical operation becomes no longer necessary."</p>

<p>The two Germans exchanged glances of dismay. "We shall lose
the opportunity for our experiment," the professor whispered to
Diggelmann. Then he continued aloud, addressing Strout: "I should
advise you to submit to the operation, nevertheless. There can be
no permanent intellectual cure without it. These effects of the
ether will pass away."</p>

<p>"Thank you," returned Strout, who at last read correctly the
cold, calculating expression that lurked behind the scientist's
spectacles. "Thank you, I am very well as I am."</p>

<p>"But you might, for the sake of science, consent&mdash;"
persisted Schwank.</p>

<p>"Yes, for the sake of science," echoed Diggelmann.</p>

<p>"Hang science!" replied Strout, fiercely. "Don't you know that
I no longer believe in science?"</p>

<p>Blanche also began to understand the true motives which had
led the German professor to interfere in her love affair. She
cast an approving glance at Strout and arose to depart. The three
Americans moved toward the door. Professor Schwank and Dr.
Diggelmann fairly gnashed their teeth with rage. Miss Bellglory
turned and made them a low curtsey.</p>

<p>"If you must trephine somebody for the sake of science,
gentlemen," she remarked with her sweetest smile, "you might draw
lots to see which of you shall trephine the other."</p>
