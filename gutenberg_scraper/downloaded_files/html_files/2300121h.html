<p>About&nbsp;ten years  ago, not a day&rsquo;s tramp from Ballarat, set well back from a dusty track that  started nowhere in particular and had no destination worth mentioning, stood the Shamrock Hotel. It was a low, rambling, disjointed  structure, and bore strong evidence of having been designed by an amateur  artist in a moment of vinous frenzy. It reached out in several well-defined  angles, and had a lean-to building stuck on here and there; numerous outhouses  were dropped down about it promiscuously; its walls were propped up in places  with logs, and its moss-covered shingle roof, bowed down with the weight of  years and a great accumulation of stones, hoop-iron, jam-tins, broken  glassware, and dried &rsquo;possum skins, bulged threateningly, on the verge of utter  collapse. The Shamrock was built of sun-dried bricks, of an  unhealthy, bilious tint. Its dirty, shattered windows were plugged in places  with old hats and discarded female apparel, and draped with green blinds, many  of which had broken their moorings, and hung despondently by one corner. Groups  of ungainly fowls coursed the succulent grasshopper before the bar door; a  moody, distempered goat rubbed her ribs against a shattered trough roughly hewn  from the butt of a tree, and a matronly old sow of spare proportions wallowed  complacently in the dust of the road, surrounded by her squealing brood.</p>
<p>A battered sign hung out over the  door of the Shamrock, informing people that Michael Doyle was  licensed to sell fermented and spirituous liquors, and that good accommodation  could be afforded to both man and beast at the lowest current rates. But that  sign was most unreliable; the man who applied to be accommodated with anything  beyond ardent beverages&mdash;liquors so fiery that they &ldquo;bit all the way  down&rdquo;&mdash;evoked the astonishment of the proprietor. Bed and board were quite out  of the province of the Shamrock. There was, in fact, only one couch  professedly at the disposal of the weary wayfarer, and this, according to the  statement of the few persons who had ever ventured to try it, seemed stuffed  with old boots and stubble; it was located immediately beneath a hen-roost,  which was the resting-place of a maternal fowl, addicted on occasion to nursing  her chickens upon the tired sleeper&rsquo;s chest. The &ldquo;turnover&rdquo; at the Shamrock was  not at all extensive, for, saving an occasional agricultural labourer who came  from &ldquo;beyant&rdquo;&mdash;which was the versatile host&rsquo;s way of designating any part within  a radius of five miles&mdash;to revel in an occasional &ldquo;spree,&rdquo; the trade was  confined to the passing &ldquo;cockatoo&rdquo; farmer, who invariably arrived on a bony,  drooping prad, took a drink, and shuffled away amid clouds of dust.</p>
<p>The only other dwellings within  sight of the Shamrock were a cluster of frail, ramshackle  huts, compiled of slabs, scraps of matting, zinc, and gunny-bag. These were the  habitations of a colony of squalid, gibbering Chinese fossickers, who herded  together like hogs in a crowded pen, as if they had been restricted to that  spot on pain of death, or its equivalent, a washing.</p>
<p>About a quarter of a mile behind  the Shamrock ran, or rather crawled, the sluggish waters of  the Yellow Creek. Once upon a time, when the Shamrock was  first built, the creek was a beautiful limpid rivulet, running between verdant  banks; but an enterprising prospector wandering that way, and liking the  indications, put down a shaft, and bottomed on &ldquo;the wash&rdquo; at twenty feet,  getting half an ounce to the dish. A rush set in, and within twelve months the  banks of the creek, for a distance of two miles, were denuded of their timber,  torn up, and covered with unsightly heaps. The creek had been diverted from its  natural course half a dozen times, and hundreds of diggers, like busy ants,  delved into the earth and covered its surface with red, white, and yellow tips.  Then the miners left almost as suddenly as they had come; the Shamrock,  which had resounded with wild revelry, became as silent as a morgue, and  desolation brooded on the face of the country. When Mr. Michael Doyle, whose  greatest ambition in life had been to become lord of a &ldquo;pub.,&rdquo; invested in that  lucrative country property, saplings were growing between the deserted holes of  the diggings, and agriculture had superseded the mining industry in those  parts.</p>
<p>Landlord Doyle was of Irish  extraction; his stock was so old that everybody had forgotten where and when it  originated, but Mickey was not proud&mdash;he assumed no unnecessary style, and his  personal appearance would not have led you to infer that there had been a king  in his family, and that his paternal progenitor had killed a landlord &ldquo;wanst.&rdquo;  Mickey was a small, scraggy man, with a mop of grizzled hair and a little red,  humorous face, ever bristling with auburn stubble. His trousers were the most  striking things about him; they were built on the premises, and always  contained enough stuff to make him a full suit and a winter overcoat. Mrs.  Doyle manufactured those pants after plans and specifications of her own  designing, and was mighty proud when Michael would yank them up into his  armpits, and amble round, peering about discontentedly over the waistband.  &ldquo;They wus th&rsquo; great savin in weskits,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Of late years it had taken all  Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s ingenuity to make ends meet. The tribe of dirty, unkempt urchins  who swarmed about the place &ldquo;took a power of feedin&rsquo;,&rdquo; and Mrs. D. herself was  &ldquo;th&rsquo; big ater.&rdquo; &ldquo;Ye do be atin&rsquo; twinty-four hours a day,&rdquo; her lord was wont to  remark, &ldquo;and thin yez must get up av noights for more. Whin ye&rsquo;r not atin&rsquo; ye&rsquo;r  munchin&rsquo; a schnack, bad cess t&rsquo;ye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In order to provide the provender  for his unreasonably hungry family, Mickey had been compelled to supplement his  takings as a Boniface by acting alternately as fossicker, charcoal-burner, and  &ldquo;wood-jamber;&rdquo; but it came &ldquo;terrible hard&rdquo; on the little man, who waxed thinner  and thinner, and sank deeper into his trousers every year. Then, to augment his  troubles, came that pestiferous heathen, the teetotal Chinee. One hot summer&rsquo;s  day he arrived in numbers, like a plague, armed with picks, shovels, dishes,  cradles, and tubs, and with a clatter of tools and a babble of grotesque  gibberish, camped by the creek and refused to go away again. The awesome  solitude of the abandoned diggings was ruthlessly broken. The deserted field,  with its white mounds and decaying windlass-stands fallen aslant, which had  lain like a long-for-gotten cemetery buried in primeval forest, was now  desecrated by the hand of the Mongol, and the sound of his weird, Oriental  oaths. The Chows swarmed over the spot, tearing open old sores, shovelling old  tips, sluicing old tailings, digging, cradling, puddling, ferreting, into every  nook and cranny.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle observed the foreign  invasion with mingled feelings of righteous anger and pained solicitude. He had  found fossicking by the creek very handy to fall back upon when the  wood-jambing trade was not brisk; but now that industry was ruined by Chinese  competition, and Michael could only find relief in deep and earnest profanity.</p>
<p>With the pagan influx began the  mysterious disappearance of small valuables from the premises of Michael Doyle,  licensed victualler. Sedate, fluffy old hens, hitherto noted for their strict  propriety and regular hours, would leave the place at dead of night, and return  from their nocturnal rambles never more; stay-at-home sucking-pigs, which had  erstwhile absolutely refused to be driven from the door, corrupted by the new  evil, absented themselves suddenly from the precincts of the Shamrock,  taking with them cooking utensils and various other articles of small value,  and ever afterwards their fate became a matter for speculation. At last a  favourite young porker went, whereupon its lord and master, resolved to  prosecute inquiries, bounced into the Mongolian camp, and, without any  unnecessary preamble, opened the debate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, now,&rdquo; he observed,  shaking his fist at the group, and bristling fiercely, &ldquo;which av ye dhirty  haythen furriners cum up to me house lasht noight and shtole me pig Nancy? Which av ye is it,  so&rsquo;t I kin bate him! ye thavin&rsquo; hathins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The placid Orientals surveyed Mr.  Doyle coolly, and innocently smiling, said, &ldquo;No savee;&rdquo; then bandied jests at  his expense in their native tongue, and laughed the little man to scorn.  Incensed by the evident ridicule of the &ldquo;haythen furriners,&rdquo; and goaded on by  the smothered squeal of a hidden pig, Michael &ldquo;went for&rdquo; the nearest Asiatic,  and proceeded to &ldquo;put a head on him as big as a tank,&rdquo; amid a storm of kicks  and digs from the other Chows. Presently the battle began to go against the  Irish cause; but Mrs. Mickey, making a timely appearance, warded off the  surplus Chinamen by chipping at their skulls with an axe-handle. The riot was  soon quelled, and the two Doyles departed triumphantly, bearing away a  corpulent young pig, and leaving several broken, discouraged Chinamen to be  doctored at the common expense.</p>
<p>After this gladsome little  episode the Chinamen held off for a few weeks. Then they suddenly changed their  tactics, and proceeded to cultivate the friendship of Michael Doyle and his  able-bodied wife. They liberally patronized the Shamrock, and  beguiled the licensee with soft but cheerful conversation; they flattered Mrs.  Doyle in seductive pigeon-English, and endeavoured to ensare the children&rsquo;s  young affections with preserved ginger. Michael regarded these advances with  misgiving; he suspected the Mongolians&rsquo; intentions were not honourable, but he  was not a man to spoil trade&mdash;to drop the substance for the shadow.</p>
<p>This state of affairs had  continued for some time before the landlord of the Shamrock noticed  that his new customers made a point of carrying off a brick every time they  visited his caravansary. When leaving, the bland heathen would cast his  discriminating eye around the place, seize upon one of the sun-dried bricks  with which the ground was littered, and steal away with a nonchalant air&mdash;as  though it had just occurred to him that the brick would be a handy thing to  keep by him. The matter puzzled Mr. Doyle sorely; he ruminated over it, but he  could only arrive at the conclusion that it was not advisable to lose custom  for the sake of a few bricks; so the Chinese continued to walk off with his  building material. When asked what they intended to do with the bricks, they  assumed an expression of the most deplorably hopeless idiocy, and suddenly lost  their acquaintance with the &ldquo;Inglisiman&rdquo; tongue. If bricks were mentioned they  became as devoid of sense as wombats, although they seemed extremely  intelligent on most other points. Mickey noticed that there was no building in  progress at their camp, also that there were no bricks to be seen about the  domiciles of the pagans, and he tried to figure out the mystery on a slate,  but, on account of his lamentable ignorance of mathematics, failed to reach the  unknown quantity and elucidate the enigma. He watched the invaders march off  with all the loose bricks that were scattered around, and never once  complained; but when they began to abstract one end of his licensed premises,  he felt himself called upon, as a husband and father, to arise and enter a  protest, which he did, pointing out to the Yellow Agony, in graphic and  forcible language, the gross wickedness of robbing a struggling man of his  house and home, and promising faithfully to &ldquo;bate&rdquo; the next lop-eared Child of  the Sun whom he &ldquo;cot shiftin&rsquo; a&rsquo;er a brick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye dogs! Wud yez shtale me  hotel, so&rsquo;t whin me family go insoide they&rsquo;ll be out in the rain?&rdquo; he queried,  looking hurt and indignant.</p>
<p>The Chinaman said, &ldquo;No savee.&rdquo;  Yet, after this warning, doubtless out of consideration for the feelings of Mr.  Doyle, they went to great pains and displayed much ingenuity in abstracting  bricks without his cognizance. But Mickey was active; he watched them closely,  and whenever he caught a Chow in the act, a brief and one-sided conflict raged,  and a dismantled Chinaman crawled home with much difficulty.</p>
<p>This violent conduct on the part  of the landlord served in time to entirely alienate the Mongolian custom from  the Shamrock, and once more Mickey and the Chows spake not when  they met. Once more, too, promising young pullets, and other portable  valuables, began to go astray, and still the hole in the wall grew till the  after-part of the Shamrock looked as if it had suffered recent  bombardment. The Chinamen came while Michael slept, and filched his hotel inch  by inch. They lost their natural rest, and ran the gauntlet of Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s  stick and his curse&mdash;for the sake of a few bricks. At all hours of the night  they crept through the gloom, and warily stole a bat or two, getting away  unnoticed perhaps, or, mayhap, only disturbing the slumbers of Mrs. Doyle, who  was a very light sleeper for a woman of her size. In the latter case the lady  would awaken her lord by holding his nose&mdash;a very effective plan of her own&mdash;and,  filled to overflowing with the rage which comes of a midnight awakening, Mickey  would turn out of doors in his shirt to cope with the marauders, and course  them over the paddocks. If he caught a heathen he laid himself out for five  minutes&rsquo; energetic entertainment, which fully repaid him for lost rest and  missing hens, and left a Chinaman too heart-sick and sore to steal anything for  at least a week. But the Chinaman&rsquo;s friends would come as usual, and the  pillage went on.</p>
<p>Michael Doyle puzzled himself to  prostration over this insatiable and unreasonable hunger for bricks; such an  infatuation on the part of men for cold and unresponsive clay had never before  come within the pale of his experience. Times out of mind he threatened to  &ldquo;have the law on the yalla blaggards;&rdquo; but the law was a long way off, and the  Celestial housebreakers continued to elope with scraps of the Shamrock,  taking the proprietor&rsquo;s assaults humbly and as a matter of course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do ye be shtealing me  house?&rdquo; fiercely queried Mr. Doyle of a submissive Chow, whom he had taken one  night in the act of ambling off with a brick in either hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me no steal &rsquo;em, no feah&mdash;odder  feller, him steal em,&rdquo; replied the quaking pagan.</p>
<p>Mickey was dumb-stricken for the  moment by this awful prevarication; but that did not impair the velocity of his  kick&mdash;this to his great subsequent regret, for the Chinaman had stowed a third  brick away in his pants for convenience of transit, and the landlord struck  that brick; then he sat down and repeated aloud all the profanity he knew.</p>
<p>The Chinaman escaped, and had  presence of mind enough to retain his burden of clay.</p>
<p>Month after month the work of  devastation went on. Mr. Doyle fixed ingenious mechanical contrivances about  his house, and turned out at early dawn to see how many Chinamen he had &ldquo;nailed&rdquo;&mdash;only  to find his spring-traps stolen and his hotel yawning more desperately than  ever. Then Michael could but lift up his voice and swear&mdash;nothing else afforded  him any relief.</p>
<p>At last he hit upon a brilliant  idea. He commissioned a &ldquo;cocky&rdquo; who was journeying into Ballarat to buy him a  dog&mdash;the largest, fiercest, ugliest, hungriest animal the town afforded; and  next day a powerful, ill-tempered canine, almost as big as a pony, and quite as  ugly as any nightmare, was duly installed as guardian and night-watch at  the Shamrock. Right well the good dog performed his duty. On the  following morning he had trophies to show in the shape of a boot, a scrap of  blue dungaree trousers, half a pig-tail, a yellow ear, and a large part of a  partially-shaved scalp; and just then the nocturnal visits ceased. The Chows  spent a week skirmishing round, endeavouring to call the dog off, but he was  neither to be begged, borrowed, nor stolen; he was too oldfashioned to eat  poisoned meat, and he prevented the smallest approach to familiarity on the  part of a Chinaman by snapping off the most serviceable portions of his  vestments, and always fetching a scrap of heathen along with them.</p>
<p>This, in time, sorely discouraged  the patient Children of the Sun, who drew off to hold congress and give the  matter weighty consideration. After deliberating for some days, the yellow  settlement appointed a deputation to wait upon Mr. Doyle. Mickey saw them  coming, and armed himself with a log and unchained his dog. Mrs. Doyle ranged  up alongside, brandishing her axe-handle, but by humble gestures and a  deferential bearing the Celestial deputation signified a truce. So Michael held  his dog down, and rested on his arms to await developments. The Chinamen  advanced, smiling blandly; they gave Mr. and Mrs. Doyle fraternal greeting, and  squirmed with that wheedling obsequiousness peculiar to &ldquo;John&rdquo; when he has  something to gain by it. A pock-marked leper placed himself in the van as  spokesman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nicee day, Missa Doyle,&rdquo; said  the moon-faced gentleman, sweetly. Then, with a sudden expression of great  interest, and nodding towards Mrs, Doyle, &ldquo;How you sissetah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foindout! Fwhat yer wantin&rsquo;?&rdquo;  replied the host of the Shamrock, gruffly; &ldquo;t&rsquo; shtale more bricks,  ye crawlin&rsquo; blaggards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no. Me not steal &rsquo;em blick&mdash;odder  feller; he hide &rsquo;em; build big house byem-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye loi, ye screw&mdash;faced nayger! I  seed ye do it, and if yez don&rsquo;t cut and run I&rsquo;ll lave the dog loose to feed on  yer dhirty carcasses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dog tried to reach for his  favourite hold, Mickey brandished his log, and Mrs. Doyle took a fresh grip of  her weapon. This demonstration gave the Chows a cold shiver, and brought them  promptly down to business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We buy &rsquo;em hotel; what for you  sell &rsquo;em&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fwhat! yez buy me hotel? D&rsquo;ye  mane it? Purchis th&rsquo; primisis and yez can shtale ivery brick at yer laysure.  But ye&rsquo;re joakin&rsquo;. Whoop! Look ye here! I&rsquo;ll have th&rsquo; lot av yez aten up in two  minits if yez play yer Choinase thricks on Michael Doyle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinamen eagerly protested  that they were in earnest, and Mickey gave them a judicial hearing. For two  years he had been in want of a customer for the Shamrock, and he  now hailed the offer of his visitors with secret delight. After haggling for an  hour, during which time the ignorant Hi Yup of the contorted countenance displayed  his usual business tact, a bargain was struck. The yellow men agreed to give  fifty pounds cash for the Shamrock and all buildings  appertaining thereto, and the following Monday was the day fixed for Michael to  journey into Ballarat with a couple of representative heathens to sign  the transfer papers and receive the cash.</p>
<p>The deputation departed smiling,  and when it gave the news of its triumph to the other denizens of the camp  there was a perfect babel of congratulations in the quaint dialogue of the  Mongol. The Chinamen proceeded to make a night of it in their own outlandish  way, indulging freely in the seductive opium, and holding high carouse over an  extemporized fantan table, proceedings which made it evident that they thought  they were getting to windward of Michael Doyle, licensed victualler.</p>
<p>Michael, too, was rejoicing with  exceeding great joy, and felicitating himself on being the shrewdest little man  who ever left the &ldquo;ould sod.&rdquo; He had not hoped to get more than a twenty-pound  note for the dilapidated old humpy, erected on Crown land, and unlikely to  stand the wear and tear of another year. As for the business, it had fallen to  zero, and would not have kept a Chinaman in soap. So Mr. Doyle plumed himself  on his bargain, and expanded till he nearly filled his capacious garments.  Still, he was harassed to know what could possibly have attached the Chinese so  strongly to the Shamrock. They had taken samples from every part of  the establishment, and fully satisfied themselves as to the quality of the  bricks, and now they wanted to buy. It was most peculiar. Michael &ldquo;had never  seen anything so quare before, savin&rsquo; wanst whin his grandfather was a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After the agreement arrived at  between the publican and the Chinese, one or two of the latter hung about the  hotel nearly all their time, in sentinel fashion. The dog was kept on the  chain, and lay in the sun in a state of moody melancholy, narrowly scrutinizing  the Mongolians. He was a strongly anti-Chinese dog, and had been educated to  regard the almond-eyed invader with mistrust and hate; it was repugnant to his  principles to lie low when the heathen was around, and he evinced his  resentment by growling ceaselessly. Sunday dawned. It was a magnificent  morning; but the rattle of the Chinamen&rsquo;s cradles and toms sounded from the  creek as usual. Three or four suave and civil Asiatics, however, still lingered  around the Shamrock, and kept an eye on it in the interests of all,  for the purchase of the hotel was to be a joint-stock affair. These &ldquo;Johns&rdquo;  seemed to imagine they had already taken lawful possession; they sat in the bar  most of the time, drinking little, but always affable and genial. Michael  suffered them to stay, for he feared that any fractiousness on his part might  upset the agreement, and that was a consummation to be avoided above all  things. They had told him, with many tender smiles and much gesticulation, that  they intended to live in the house when it became theirs; but Mr. Doyle was not  interested&mdash;his fifty pounds was all he thought of.</p>
<p>Michael was in high spirits that  morning; he beamed complacently on all and sundry, appointed the day as a time  of family rejoicing, and in the excess of his emotion actually slew for dinner  a prime young sucking pig, an extravagant luxury indulged in by the Doyles only  on state occasions. On this particular Sunday the younger members of the Doyle  household gathered round the festive board and waited impatiently for the  lifting of the lid of the camp-oven. There were nine children in all, ranging  in years from fourteen downwards&mdash;&ldquo;foine, shtrappin&rsquo; childer, wid th&rsquo; clear  brain,&rdquo; said the prejudiced Michael. The round, juicy sticker was at last  placed upon the table. Mrs. Doyle stood prepared to administer her  department&mdash;serving the vegetables to her hungry brood&mdash;and, armed with a  formidable knife and fork, Michael, enveloped in savoury steam, hovered over  the pig.</p>
<p>But there was one function yet to  be performed&mdash;a function which came as regularly as Sunday&rsquo;s dinner itself.  Never, for years, had the housefather failed to touch up a certain prodigious  knife on one particular hard yellow brick in the wall by the door, preparatory  to carving the Sunday&rsquo;s meat. Mickey examined the edge of his weapon  critically, and found it unsatisfactory. The knife was nearly ground through to  the backbone; another &ldquo;touch-up&rdquo; and it must surely collapse, but, in view of  his changed circumstances, Mr. Doyle felt that he might take the risk. The  brick, too, was worn an inch deep. A few sharp strokes from Mickey&rsquo;s vigorous  right arm were all that was required; but, alas! the knife snapped whereupon  Mr. Doyle swore at the brick, as if holding it immediately responsible for the  mishap, and stabbed at it fiercely with the broken carver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howly Moses! Fwhats that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The brick fell to pieces, and  there, embedded in the wall, gleaming in the sunbeam, was a nugget of yellow  gold. With feverish haste Mickey tore the brick from its bedding, and smashed  the gold-bearing fragment on the hearth. The nugget was a little beauty,  smooth, round, and four ounces to a grain.</p>
<p>The sucking pig froze and  stiffened in its fat, the &ldquo;taters&rdquo; and the cabbage stood neglected on the  dishes. The truth had dawned upon Michael, and, whilst the sound of a spirited  debate in musical Chinese echoed from the bar, his family were gathered around  him, open-mouthed, and Mickey was industriously, but quietly, pounding the  sun-dried brick in a digger&rsquo;s mortar. Two bricks, one from either end of  the Shamrock, were pulverized, and Michael panned off the dirt in a  tub of water which stood in the kitchen. Result: seven grains of waterworn  gold. Until now Michael had worked dumbly, in a fit of nervous excitement; now  he started up, bristling like a hedgehog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let loose th&rsquo; dog, Mary Melinda  Doyle!&rdquo; he howled, and, uttering a mighty whoop, he bounded into the bar to  dust those Chinamen off his premises. &ldquo;Gerrout!&rdquo; he screamed&mdash;&ldquo;Gerrout av me  primises, ye thavin&rsquo; crawlers!&rdquo; And he frolicked with the astounded Mongolians  like a tornado in full blast, thumping at a shaven occiput whenever one showed  out of the struggling crowd. The Chinamen left; they found the dog waiting for  them outside, and he encouraged them to greater haste. Like startled fawns the  heathens fled, and Mr. Doyle followed them, howling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buy the Shamrock,  wud yez! Robbers! Thaves! Fitch back th.&rsquo; soide o&rsquo; me house, or Oi&rsquo;ll have th&rsquo;  law onto yez all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The damaged escapees communicated  the intelligence of their overthrow to their brethren on the creek, and the  news carried consternation, and deep, dark woe to the pagans, who clustered  together and ruefully discussed the situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle was wildly jubilant.  His joy was only tinctured with a spice of bitterness, the result of knowing  that the &ldquo;haythens&rdquo; had got away with a few hundreds of his precious bricks. He  tried to figure out the amount of gold his hotel must contain, but again his  ignorance of arithmetic tripped him up, and already in imagination Michael  Doyle, licensed victualler, was a millionaire and a J.P.</p>
<p>The Shamrock was  really a treasure-house. The dirt of which the bricks were composed had been  taken from the banks of the Yellow Creek, years before the outbreak of the  rush, by an eccentric German who had settled on that sylvan spot. The German  died, and his grotesque structure passed into other hands. Time went on, and  then came the rush. The banks of the creek were found to be charged with gold  for miles, but never for a moment did it occur to anybody that the clumsy old  building by the track, now converted into a hotel, was composed of the same  rich dirt; never till years after, when by accident one of the Mongolian  fossickers discovered grains of gold in a few bats he had taken to use as hobs.  The intelligence was conveyed to his fellows; they got more bricks and more  gold&mdash;hence the robbery of Mr. Doyle&rsquo;s building material and the anxiety of the  Mongolians to buy the Shamrock. Before nightfall Michael summoned  half-a-dozen men from &ldquo;beyant,&rdquo; to help him in protecting his hotel from a  possible Chinese invasion. Other bricks were crushed and yielded splendid  prospects. The Shamrock&rsquo;s small stock of liquor was drunk, and  everybody became hilarious. On the Sunday night, under cover of the darkness,  the Chows made a sudden sally on the Shamrock, hoping to get away  with plunder. They were violently received, however; they got no bricks, and  returned to their camp broken and disconsolate.</p>
<p>Next day the work of demolition  was begun. Drays were backed up against the Shamrock, and load by  load the precious bricks were carted away to a neighbouring battery. The  Chinamen slouched about, watching greedily, but their now half-hearted attempts  at interference met with painful reprisal. Mr. Doyle sent his family and  furniture to Ballarat, and in a week there was not a vestige left to mark the  spot where once the Shamrock flourished. Every scrap of its  walls went through the mill, and the sum of one thousand nine hundred and  eighty-three pounds sterling was cleared out of the ruins of the hostelry. Mr.  Doyle is now a man of some standing in Victoria,  and as a highly respected J.P. has often been pleased to inform a Chinaman that  it was &ldquo;foive pound or a month.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AVisittoScrubbyGully"></a>A Visit to Scrubby Gully</h2>
<p>The men at the  mine were anxious to have me visit our magnificent property. The battery and  water-wheel were erected, there were 50 tons of stone in the hopper, and we  only needed water and the blessing of Providence  to start crushing out big weekly dividends. I know now that there has never  been a time within the memory of man when Scrubby Gully did not want water, and  that Scrubby Gully is the one place on earth to which a discriminating man  would betake himself if he wished to avoid all the blessings of Providence for  ever. But that is beside the matter.</p>
<p>I was carefully instructed by  letter to take the train to Kanan, coach it to the Rabbit Trap, take horse from  Whalan&rsquo;s to the Cross Roads, ask someone at Old Poley&rsquo;s on the hill to direct  me to Sheep&rsquo;s Eye; from there strike west on foot, keeping Bugle Point on my  right, and &ldquo;Chin Whiskers&rdquo; would meet me at The Crossing. There was no  accommodation at the mine for city visitors, but I was given to understand Mr.  Larry Jeans would be happy to accommodate me at his homestead over the spur.</p>
<p>Casual references to Mr. Jeans in  the correspondence gave me the impression that Jeans was an affluent gentleman  of luxurious tastes and a hospitable disposition, and that a harmless  eccentricity led him to follow agricultural and pastoral pursuits in the  vicinity of Scrubby Gully instead of wasting his time in voluptuous ease in the  city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chin Whiskers&rdquo; met me at The  Crossing. &ldquo;Chin Whiskers&rdquo; was a meditative giant who exhausted his mental and  physical energies chewing tobacco, and who bore about his person interesting  and obvious evidence of the length and the severity of the local drought&mdash;he  was, in fact, the drought incarnate. The Crossing was a mere indication of a  track across a yellow, rock-strewn indentation between two hills, which  indentation, &ldquo;Chin Whiskers&rdquo; informed me, was &ldquo;The Creek.&rdquo; That did not  surprise me, because I knew that every second country township and district in Australia has a  somewhat similar indentation which it always calls &ldquo;The Creek.&rdquo; Sometimes &ldquo;The  Creek&rdquo; has moist places in it, sometimes it is quite damp for almost a dozen  miles, but more often it is as hard and dry as a brick-kiln. When the  indentation is really wet along its whole length it is invariably called &ldquo;The River.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I found the mine; it was a simple  horizontal hole bored in a hill. The battery was there, and the water-wheel.  The water-wheel stood disconsolate beside the dust-strewn creek, and looked as  much at home as a water-wheel might be expected to look in the centre of the  sandy wastes of Sahara. The working  shareholders were unaffectedly glad to see me. They were sapless and  drought-stricken, but they assured me, with great enthusiasm, that they lived  in momentary expectation of a tremendous downfall. Leen had been mending the  roof of his hut, he said, in readiness for the heavy rains which were due  before morning. He examined the sky critically, and expressed a belief that I  would be detained on Scrubby Gully a couple of weeks or so in consequence of the  floods.</p>
<p>This spirit of unreasonable  hopefulness and trust seemed to be shared by Cody, and Ellis, and MacMahon. I  alone was dubious. The journey up had worn me out; the dry desolation all  around and the flagrant unprofitableness of our spec. sickened me; but Jeans  still remained&mdash;the prodigal Jeans, with his spacious homestead and profuse  hospitality. I was heartfully grateful for Jeans. We met in due course. As I  talked with Leen, a man came wearily down the hill, towing a meagre horse,  which in turn was towing a log. This man delivered his log, unslung his animal,  and approached us, heroically lugging behind him the miserable apology for a  horse&mdash;a morbid brute manifestly without a hope or ambition left in life, and  conveying mysteriously to the observer a knowledge of its fixed and unshakable  determination to lie down and die the moment its owner&rsquo;s attention was  otherwise directed. But the proprietor seemed fully alive to the situation, and  never allowed his thoughts to stray entirely from the horse, but was  continually jerking its head up, and addressing towards it reproaches,  expostulations, and curses&mdash;curses that had lost all their vigour and dignity.  This man was Jeans, and if I had not seen his horse I would have said that  Jeans was the most hopelessly heart-broken and utterly used-up animal breathing  on the face of the earth. He was about 40, grey, hollow&mdash;cheeked,  hollow&mdash;chested, bent, and apathetic with the dreadful apathy that comes of  wasted effort, vain toil, and blasted hopes. Jeans had a face that had  forgotten how to smile and never scowled&mdash;a face that took no exercise, but  remained set in the one wooden expression of joyless, passionless indifference  to whatever fate could offer henceforth and forever. My last hopes exploded at  the sight of him.</p>
<p>Mr. Larry Jeans said I was  welcome to camp in the spare room &ldquo;up to&rdquo; his place, and added dully that  &ldquo;proberly&rdquo; his missus could scrape up grub enough for me &ldquo;fer a day&rsquo;r two.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Proberly&rdquo; did not sound very encouraging, but I had no option, and, being dead-beat,  accepted the hospitality offered, and followed Mr. Jeans. Larry laboriously  hauled his melancholy horse over a couple of low stony rises, and then we  tackled the scrag end of the range, across which led a vague track that wound  in and out amongst a forest of great rocks, and presented all the difficulties  and dangers of mountaineering without its compensations. Jeans struggled on  with dull patience, and in silence, saving when it was necessary to divert the  old horse from his morbid thoughts, and when he briefly answered my questions.  I gathered from him that the men at the mine had been expecting rain for four  months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think of the  chances?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, me, I never expect nothin&rsquo;.  Sometimes things happen. I don&rsquo;t expect &rsquo;em, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things happen&mdash;what, for  instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dry spells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I elicited that pleuro happened,  and rabbits, and fires, and &ldquo;this here new-fangled fever.&rdquo; But whatever  happened Jeans never fluctuated; he had struck an average of misery, and was  bogged in the moral slough. It seemed as if his sensibilities above a certain  capacity had been worn out by over-work, and refused to feel more than a fixed  degree of trouble, so that whatever might come on top of his present woes, be  it fever, or fire, or death, the man remained in his normal condition of grim  apathy and spiritless obedience to fate.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;homestead&rdquo; stood upon the  flat timbered country beyond the rise. It was just what Jeans&rsquo;s homestead might  have been expected to be&mdash;a low structure of bark and slabs, with a slab chimney  at one end, and a door in the middle between two canvas &ldquo;windows.&rdquo; It stood in  a small clearing; just beyond the house stood the skeleton of a shed, upon  which, it being sundown, roosted a few gaunt fowls; a lank cow with one horn  was deeply meditating by the front door. There were signs of bold raids upon  the stubborn bush, pathetic ventures; and great butts lay about in evidence of  much weary but unprofitable work. A dog-leg fence, starting at no particular  point, straddled along in front of the house, and finished nowhere about a  hundred yards off. Not a new fence either, but an old one, with much dry grass  matted amongst the logs&mdash;that was the pathos of it. There had been a brave  attempt at a garden, too; but the few fruit trees that stood had been stripped  of the bark, and the hens had made dust-baths in all the beds. In this dust an  army of children were wallowing&mdash;half-clad, bare-footed, dirt-encrusted children, but all  hale and boisterous.</p>
<p>At the door we were met by Mrs.  Larry Jeans, and after introducing me as &ldquo;him from the city,&rdquo; the master  laboured away, dragging his shuffling horse, and leaving me in the centre of a  wondering circle of youngsters of all sorts and sizes, from two dusty mites not  yet properly balanced on their crooked little legs up to a shock-headed  lubberly boy of thirteen, curiously embossed with large tan freckles, and a  tall, gawky girl of the same age in preposterously short skirts, whom my  presence afflicted with a most painful bashfulness. A peculiarity about Jeans&rsquo;s  children that struck me was the fact that they seemed to run in sets: there was  a pair even for the sticky baby deftly hooked under its mother&rsquo;s left arm,  judging by the petulant wailing to be heard within.</p>
<p>The Jeans&rsquo;s homestead consisted  of two compartments. I looked about in vain for the &ldquo;spare room,&rdquo; and concluded  it must be either the capacious fire-place or the skeleton shed on which the  hens were roosting. The principal article of kitchen furniture was a long plank  table built into the floor; between it and the wall was a bush-made form, also  a fixture. A few crazy three-legged stools, a safe manufactured from a  zinc-lined case, and an odd assortment of crockery and tin cups, saucers, and  plates piled on slab shelves in one corner, completed the list of &ldquo;fixings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Larry Jeans was a short,  bony, homely woman, very like her husband&mdash;strangely, pathetically like in face  and demeanour; similarly bowed with labour, and with the same air of  hopelessness and of accepting the toils and privations of their miserable  existence as an inevitable lot. She was always working, and always had worked;  her hands were hard and contorted in evidence of it, and her cheek was as brown  and as dry as husks from labouring in the sun.</p>
<p>We had tea and bread and boiled  onions and corned beef for tea that evening&mdash;a minimum of beef and a maximum of  onions. The last onion crop had been a comparative success somewhere within  half a day&rsquo;s journey of Scrubby Gully. Tea served to introduce more children;  they dangled over the arms of the unhappy mother, hung to her skirts, sprawled  about her feet, squabbled in the corners, and overran the house. Jeans helped  to feed the brood in his slow, patient way, and after tea he helped to pack  away the younger in little bundles&mdash;here, there, and everywhere&mdash;where they slept  peacefully, but in great apparent peril, whilst the bigger kids charged about  the room and roared, and fought, and raised a very pandemonium of their own.  Every now and again Mrs. Jeans would lift her tired head from her sewing or her  insatiable twins, and say weakly, &ldquo;Now, you Jinny, behave.&rdquo; Or Larry would  remark dispassionately, &ldquo;Hi, you, Billy!&rdquo; But otherwise the youngsters raged  unchecked, their broken-spirited parents seeming to regard the noise and worry  of them as the lightest trial in a world of struggling and trouble.</p>
<p>I asked Jeans how many children  he thought he had. He didn&rsquo;t seem certain, but after due deliberation said  there might be thirteen in all. He had probably lost count, for I am certain I  tallied fifteen&mdash;seven sets and one odd one.</p>
<p>When the washing-up was done, and  half of the family were bedded down, Larry dragged a tangle of old harness from  the other room, and sat for two hours painfully piecing it up with cord, and  his wife sat opposite him, silent and blank of face, mending one set of rags  with another&mdash;I perched upon a stool watching the pair, studying one face after  the other, irritated at length by the sheeplike immobility of both, thinking it  would be a relief if Jeans would suddenly break out and do something desperate,  something to show that he had not, in spite of appearances, got beyond the  possibility of sanguinary revolt; but he worked on steadily, uncomplainingly,  till the boy with the unique freckles came hurrying in with the intelligence  that the old horse was &ldquo;havin&rsquo; a fit&rsquo;r somethin&rsquo;.&rdquo; Jeans did not swear. He said  &ldquo;Is he but?&rdquo; and put aside his harness, and went out, like a man for whom life  has no surprises.</p>
<p>The selector was over an hour  struggling with his hypochondriac horse, whilst I exchanged fragments of  conversation with Mrs. Jeans, and went upon various mental excursions after  that spare room. It appeared that the Jeanses had neighbours. There was another  family settled seven miles up the gully, but Mrs. Jeans informed me that the Dicksons,  being quiet and sort of down-hearted, were not very good company, consequently  she and Jeans rarely visited them. I was indulging in a mental prospect of the  jubilation at a reunion of the down-hearted Dicksons and the gay and frivolous  Jeanses when Larry returned from his struggle with the horse. He resumed his  work upon the harness without any complaint. His remark that &ldquo;Them skewball  horses is alwis onreasonable&rdquo; was not spoken in a carping spirit; it was given  as conveying valuable information to a stranger.</p>
<p>At 11 o&rsquo;clock my host &ldquo;s&rsquo;posed  that p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps maybe&rdquo; I was ready to turn in. I was, and we went forth together  in quest of the spare room. The room in question proved to be a  hastily-constructed lean-to on the far corner of the house, at the back.  Inside, one wall was six feet high and the other was merely a tree-butt. My  bunk was built against the butt, and between the bunk and the roof there were  about eighteen inches of space. That bunk had not been run up for a fat man.  After establishing me in the spare room Jeans turned to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best bar the door with a log,  case o&rsquo; the cow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If she comes bumpin&rsquo; round in the night, don&rsquo;t  mind. She walks in her sleep moonlight nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It only needed this to convince  me that I was usurping the customary domicile of the meditative cow.</p>
<p>The room had been carefully  furbished up and deeply carpeted with scrub ferns. But the cow was not to be  denied.</p>
<p>Weary as I was, I got little  sleep that night. I had fallen off comfortably about half an hour after turning  in, when I was awakened again by some commotion in the house. Half a dozen of  the children were blubbering, and I could hear the heavy tread of Larry, and  the equally heavy tread of his wife, moving about the house. Presently both  passed by the lean-to, and away in the direction of the range. For another  half-hour or so there was silence, and then the one-horned cow came along and  tried my door. Failing to open it, she tried the walls and the roof, but could  not break her way in, so she camped under the lee of the structure, and lowed  dismally at intervals till day-break.</p>
<p>When I arose a scantily-attired  small boy generously provided me with a pint pannikin three-parts full of  water. The water was for my morning bath, and the small boy was careful to warn  me not to throw it away when I was through with it. This youngster told me that  &ldquo;Dad, an&rsquo; mum, an&rsquo; Jimmy &rdquo; had been out all night hunting Steve. Steve, I  gathered, was the one enterprising child in the household, and was in the habit  of going alone upon voyages of exploration along the range, where, being a very  little fellow, he usually lost himself, and provided his parents with a night&rsquo;s  entertainment searching for him in the barren gorges and about the  boulder-strewn spurs of the range. How it happened that he was not missed till  nearly midnight on this occasion I cannot say, unless the father and mother  were really as ignorant of the extent and character of their family as they  appeared to be.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jeans was the first to  return, and she brought Steve with her. The dear child had not been lost, after  all. Incensed by some indignity that had been put upon him during the  afternoon, he had &ldquo;run away from home,&rdquo; he said, and slept all night in a  wombat&rsquo;s hole about 200 yards from the house. There his mother found him,  returning from her long, weary search. The incident did not appear to have  affected her in any way; she looked as tired and as heart-sick as on the  previous evening, but not more so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we lost one little one  there&rdquo;&mdash;she extended her hand towards the low, rambling repellent hills&mdash;&ldquo;an&rsquo;  found him dead a week after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Larry returned half an hour  later, and his apathy under the circumstances was simply appalling.</p>
<p>We had fried onions and bread and  tea for breakfast, and immediately the meal was over Larry, who I imagined  would be going to bed for a few hours, appeared in front of the house leading  his deplorable horse. He was bound for the mine, he said. I put in that day  exploring the tunnel, examining the immovable mill, hunting for specimens in the  quartz-tip, and listening to Leen&rsquo;s cheerful weather prophesies; and Jeans and  his soured quadruped dragged logs to the mine from a patch of timber about a  mile off, which patch the men alluded to largely as The Gum Forest.</p>
<p>Returning to the homestead at  sundown we found the children fighting in the dust and the one-horned cow  meditating at the door as on the previous evening. I fancied I detected in the  eye of the cow a look of pathetic reproach as I passed her. Tea that evening  consisted mainly of roast onions. Jeans felt called upon to apologize because  the boys had been unable to trap a rabbit for my benefit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now&rsquo;n agen, after a rainy spell,  we&rsquo;re &rsquo;most afraid the rabbits is a-goin&rsquo; to eat us, an&rsquo; then when we&rsquo;d like a  rabbit-stoo there ain&rsquo;t a rabbit to be found within twenty mile,&rdquo; said the  settler impassively. &ldquo;When there is rabbits, there ain&rsquo;t onions,&rdquo; he added as a  further contribution to the curiosities of natural history.</p>
<p>The second night at Scrubby Gully  was painfully like the first: Mrs. Jeans stitched, Mr. Jeans laboured over his  tangle of harness, and the brood rolled and tumbled about the room, raising  much dust and creating a deafening noise, to which Larry and Mary his wife gave  little heed. When a section of the family had been parcelled up and put to  sleep, I was tempted to ask Jeans why he continued to live in that unhallowed,  out-of-the-way corner, and to waste his energies upon a parched and blasted  holding instead of settling somewhere within reach of a market and beyond the  blight of tangible and visible despair that hung over Scrubby Gully and its  vicinity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; said Jeans, without  interest, &ldquo;&rsquo;pears t&rsquo; me t&rsquo; be pretty much as bad in other places. Evans is the  same, so&rsquo;s Calder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not know either Evans or  Calder, but I pitied both from the bottom of my heart. Jeans admitted that he  had given up hope of getting the timber off his land, though he &ldquo;suspected&rdquo; he  might be able to handle it somehow &ldquo;when the boys grew up.&rdquo; He further admitted  that he didn&rsquo;t know &ldquo;as the land was good for anythin&rsquo; much&rdquo; when it was  cleared but his pessimism was proof against all my arguments, and I went sadly  to bunk, leaving the man and his wife working with slow, animal perseverance,  apparently unconscious of the fact that they had not slept a wink for over  thirty hours.</p>
<p>The cow raided my room shortly  after midnight. She managed to break down the door this time, but as her  intentions were peaceful, and as it was preferable rather to have her for a  room-mate than to be kept awake by her pathetic complaints, I made no attempt  to evict her, and we both passed an easy night.</p>
<p>I was up early next morning, but  Mr. and Mrs. Jeans were before me. They were standing together down by the  aimless dog-leg fence, and the hypochondriacal horse lay between them. I walked  across, suspecting further &ldquo;unreasonableness&rdquo; on the part of the horse. The  animal was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old man, how&rsquo;ll you manage to  haul those logs in now?&rdquo; As Mrs. Jeans said this I fancied I saw flicker in her  face for a moment a look of spiritual agony, a hint of revolt that might  manifest itself in tears and bitter complainings, but it passed in the instant.</p>
<p>Jeans merely shook his head, and  answered something indicative of the complete destruction of his faith in &ldquo;them  skewbald horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had bread and onions for  breakfast.</p>
<p>When I last saw Jeans, as I was  leaving Scrubby Gully that day, he was coming down the hill from the direction  of the gum forest, struggling in the blinding heat, with a rope over his  shoulder, towing a nine-foot sluice leg.</p>
<p>We had a letter from Leen  yesterday; he says the working shareholders are hurrying to get the sluice  fixed over the wheel, and he (Leen) anticipates a heavy downfall of rain during  the night.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AnIncidentattheOldPioneer"></a>An Incident at the Old Pioneer</h2>
<p>Manager M&lsquo;Fie&nbsp;had  seen the 12 o&rsquo;clock shift below, and now, tired and disgusted, he kicked off  his wet things, and &ldquo;turned in.&rdquo; Manager M&lsquo;Fie&rsquo;s hut was quite a salubrious  summer residence, but the rain had already picked holes in the bark roof. An  iron bucket suspended above the head of the bunk caught the tiny stream that  would otherwise have dribbled upon his pillow, an oil-skin coat turned the  drops that rained upon the foot of the bed into a miniature river meandering  along the hard clay floor, and the darkness was made musical by the tinkling sound  of drops falling into tin dishes placed here and there about the hut to catch  them. Mack curled down amongst the blankets under his great &rsquo;possum rug, swore  a prayer or two, and endeavoured to give himself up to sweet forgetfulness of  his &ldquo;danged roomertism,&rdquo; the fact that she was pinching out&mdash;&ldquo;she&rdquo; being the  reef&mdash;and his many other managerial troubles.</p>
<p>Outside the night was pitch dark,  and the rain raced by in successive charges, driven by the howling wind that  caught and tore the gusts of phosphorescent steam above the engine-house at the  mine, and sent the fragments streaming and curling away amongst the complaining  trees like maddened wraiths. The driver in the well-lighted, rain-tight  engine-house whistled contentedly over his work, and the battery boys, under  comfortable shelter, rather delighted in the storm, the howling of which could  be heard even above the thunder of the stampers; but the unfortunate braceman,  crouching in the lee of one of the poppet-legs beneath the misty yellow glow of  his lantern, cold, soddened, and more than half afraid of the tempest, that  shook the brace vigorously under its bare poles, muffled the chattering of his  teeth with a big quid, and heartily envied the facemen in the warm stopes and  drives below.</p>
<p>Sleep was long coming to the  weary &ldquo;skipper;&rdquo; he lay awake for hours, feeling the rheumatism like rats  gnawing. in his old bones, and swearing quietly but with the emphasis of a  devout &ldquo;Geordie.&rdquo; At length, whilst listening intently for the four o&rsquo;clock  whistle, oblivion fell upon him, and a deep organ note mingled with the  tinkling of the raindrops in the scattered tins.</p>
<p>Mack imagined he had not slept  twenty minutes when he was roughly awakened. He felt himself being  energetically shaken, and heard a voice with a decided note of terror in it  mixed up with the march, march, march of the rain and the long shrill cries of  the wind in the dead gums. A shower of water rained upon his face from wet  oilskins as he turned, and the voice of Tom White called again:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, boss, tumble up!  The &lsquo;big blow &rsquo; has caved in, and the old shaft is choked with reef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager was out on the sloppy  floor in a moment, groping for his clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; Brierly, Brierly&mdash;&mdash;D&mdash;&mdash;n it  all, man! what about Brierly?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is trapped like a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord, Lord!&rdquo; groaned M&lsquo;Fie, &ldquo;an&rsquo;  there hasn&rsquo;t been a man near the cursed hole for months before to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mack discovered the matches, but  they were like mush in his hand, and he was compelled to tear his way into his  clothes in the darkness. Presently he rushed after White towards the mine. The  whistle was piping piteously against the storm, which still thundered in the  gully.</p>
<p>A hasty examination served to  inform the manager of the extent of the disaster, which troubled him all the  more for the fact that it was not quite unforeseen and might have been avoided.  About forty yards from the working shaft of the Old Pioneer mine was another  and a smaller shaft, one that had been sunk by the discoverers of the reef. At  the lower-most level of the latter hole the two shafts were connected by means  of a drive for the purpose of improving the air in the workings. Within about  fifty feet of the surface the original workers had opened out and struck a big  blow of quartz, the very richest of the lode, and in taking out the stone had  excavated a great irregular chamber, reaching in places to within twenty feet  of the surface. This chamber they eventually stowed full of loose reef from the  lower workings, with the dual object of saving hauling and holding up the  ground. It was a bad job from a miner&rsquo;s point of view, but when a small  independent party is on rich stuff that is not expected to hold out the members  rarely waste time on fancy mining. Long since the surface over the excavation  had settled down, leaving a large hollow place. To-night the great pressure of  the many tons of earth, combined with the force exerted by the swelling of the  reef, caused by the moisture that percolated through, had crushed out the  timbers that walled up the mouth of the old drive, and sent the broken reef  pouring into the pit, like the waters of a cataract, filling eighty feet of  shaft in the winking of an eye.</p>
<p>If this were all the accident  might not have been very serious, but at 12 o&rsquo;clock M&lsquo;Fie had sent Bill Brierly  to put in a shift in a small drive leading from the air-shaft towards the Old  Pioneer, and about thirty feet from the bottom of the former. Scarcely any work  had been done in this drive since it was opened out, and now the shaft was  choked, and Brierly was penned in that tiny chamber, with air enough, Mack  reckoned, to last a man five hours, provided he had sense enough to put out his  candles, and sit and wait for death in the dark&mdash;a hair-bleaching,  marrow-freezing experience men say who have so sat and waited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the battery!&rdquo; roared M&lsquo;Fie,  after his cursory inspection. &ldquo;Send the boys to knock up the men at the Piper  an&rsquo; up at Mother Murty&rsquo;s. They&rsquo;ll never hear that penny whistle agin this wind.  White, you take Harry an&rsquo; Bricky an&rsquo; a couple of others when they come, an&rsquo; rig  a win&rsquo;las over the air-shaft, an&rsquo; pull reef till all&rsquo;s blue! Ben, go below&mdash;I  expect Evans an&rsquo; Castro are already on the job. Chuck it down the winze, stow  it anywhere, an&rsquo; work&mdash;work like fiends. If we don&rsquo;t get at Brierly inside five  hours I&rsquo;m a done man, an&rsquo; so is he!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The manager remained on top a few  minutes longer, giving orders to the brace-man and the engine-driver, and then  went below with a couple of volunteers who had come out of the black bush,  half-dressed and puffing like engines. In No. 3, which drive ran into the old  shaft, three silent men, stripped to their flannels, reeking in the faint,  ghostly light of the candles, worked desperately upon the broken reef that had  gushed into the drive.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Fie and the others &ldquo;took a  hand,&rdquo; more men came down in the next cage, and the next, and next, and  presently wherever there was room for a man to plant a shovel or push a truck a  man was toiling with the magnificent energy with which the meanest miner is  endowed when the life of a mate is at stake. On the brace three or four men  handled the trucks as the cages leapt to the landing. The engine throbbed,  groaned, and strained like a living thing, and the eager volunteers, stoking  vigorously, kept steam up to a dangerous pressure, while the safety-valve  fairly shrieked under it. At the mouth of the air-shaft a brawny contingent  whirled the windlass, pulling dirt from the top of the heap below, where two  men toiled like heroes. Six or seven others, waiting to relieve exhausted  mates, gathered in the red glow before the boilers, and talked of the  imprisoned man in low voices and with a newborn respect, telling all the best  they knew of him; and two or three frightened, curious women, with shawls drawn  over their heads, peered with white faces out of the surrounding darkness.</p>
<p>At daybreak the struggle was  still going on with undiminished zeal, and every handy place that would hold a  truck of dirt was choked with reef, and the cages sprang up with the full  trucks or rattled down with the &ldquo;empties&rdquo; swiftly, and with scarcely a pause.</p>
<p>Manager M&lsquo;Fie worked with the  best of them. Drenched with perspiration, bruised and cut by pieces of falling  reef, he faced the mass of dirt in the old shaft, careless of danger and  ignorant of fatigue. As fast as the reef was shovelled away more rolled into  the drive out of the shaft, but at length Mack uttered a sharp exclamation of  joy and pointed to a dark open space showing below the cap-piece of the first  set. Enlarging this with a few strokes of the shovel, he seized a candle and  examined the shaft beyond; then, staggering back in the drive, bellowed a cheer  that was caught up by the men and echoed on the brace.</p>
<p>The unexpected had happened. The  choked pit was a ladder-shaft; a stout ladder, well stayed, ran up the side of the  shaft, past the drive in which Brierly was immured; between it and the slabs  lining the shaft was a space about 18 in. wide; large lumps of reef had jammed  between the rungs, and now, right up the side to the mouth of the drive, was a  clear passage, large enough to admit of the escape of a slight man like  Brierly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steady lads&mdash;easy does it!&rdquo; said  Mack, as the men attacked the reef again. &ldquo;A wrong stroke might bring the stuff  down again. Clear a way, an let&rsquo;s see what can be done.&rdquo; Mack put his head into  the shaft and called, but no answer came back. He called louder, again and  again. Still there was no reply, and the old manager turned away, and looked  meaningly into the blank faces of the men, and his own cheeks were grey with  dread.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll chance it, boss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A young fellow stepped forward&mdash;a  trucker, a boy merely&mdash;with a plain, strong face and glowing eyes, luminous with  resolution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, lad! it might mean  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But young Stevens pushed by the  extended arm and seized the ladder. Somebody stuck a lighted candle on his hat  with a scrap of moist clay, and he went up the shaft on the under side of the  ladder, climbing gingerly, conscious that the least vibration might bring the  reef rushing in upon him. Mack watched him from below, and no man spoke a word.  The boy reached the drive, paused only a moment, and started down again. Half a  minute later he was dragged from the ladder by M&lsquo;Fie&rsquo;s eager hands, and the  same instant the reef rushed in, and filled up the place where he had been, and  poured into the drive with a vibrant roar like thunder. Stevens stood with his  back to one of the legs for a moment, a superstitious fear transfiguring his  face, his limbs trembling painfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not there!&rdquo; he gasped in a  choked voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; murmured M&lsquo;Fie, &ldquo;he is  there;&rdquo; and he pointed towards the filled-in shaft with a despairing gesture.  &ldquo;He must have made a rush for the ladder when she started to run, and he&rsquo;s  under the reef. It&rsquo;s all UP, boys!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something like a groan broke from  the lips of the men, but they seized their shovels and went to work again&mdash;all  but one man. Graham turned away and walked towards the working shaft. He went  up on the cage, and in less than five minutes returned and drew M&lsquo;Fie aside. He  whispered a few words in the manager&rsquo;s ear, and Mack followed him with an  amazed look in his face. The two men got on the cage, and Graham pulled the  knocker, signalling to the engine-driver to drop them at No. 2.</p>
<p>Graham led the way along No. 2,  in which drive no work had been done for some months, and presently stopped and  threw the light of his candle full upon the recumbent form of a man sleeping  heavily upon a few slabs, his head pillowed on his arm. Mack turned the face  towards the light, and beheld Bill Brierly, the supposed dead man. Graham, and  M&lsquo;Fie stared at each other for a moment. Graham grinned feebly but Mack  breathed a mighty oath. Brierly&rsquo;s tea-flask lay near. The manager picked it up  and brought it to his nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunk!&rdquo; he ejaculated, kicking  the sleeping miner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a jackass,&rdquo; responded Graham,  tersely.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later the brace-man  called to the men below to knock off and come up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got Brierly. He is  alive!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>The men rushed the cages,  cheering, and wondering. On top a circle of disgusted miners stood round Bill  Brierly, who lay sprawling on the floor before the boilers, grinning inanely in  his drunken sleep. The truth was told in constrained whispers. Brierly was  probably &ldquo;half-screwed&rdquo; when he went on at 12; he had made his way to No. 2, the  driest and warmest drive in the mine, early in the shift, taking his flask of  rum with him, and intending, no doubt, to &ldquo;do a comfortable loaf&rdquo; up there; and  there he had lain, stupidly drunk, throughout those dreadful hours of anxiety  and toil. The men thought of their long struggle and their wasted sympathies,  of the reef piled everywhere about the workings, yesterday so orderly and  correct, and each man glanced into his neighbour&rsquo;s face, but none spoke; no one  even ventured to swear, and they could not laugh&mdash;the situation was too  tremendous for any form of expression of which they were capable.</p>
<p>One by one the worn-out miners  dragged themselves away towards their huts and houses, but M&lsquo;Fie remained,  sitting on a log, glowering at the drunken man, his mind full of the choked  winzes and drives below, and of young Stevens cheek by jowl with death on the  buried ladder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you going to turn in,  boss?&rdquo; someone asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, angrily. &ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m  goin&rsquo; to sit here till Bill Brierly sobers up, an&rsquo; then, by thunder, I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;  to kick him from here to the Piper, an&rsquo; back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, man, this is better than  having to fish him from under the reef.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno, I dunno!&rdquo; snarled Mack,  striking his knee fiercely with his great gnarled fist, &ldquo;but I must kick that  man or blow up!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AttheYards"></a>At the Yards</h2>
<p>Waddy, in its  decadence, lived through two days of every week. The awakening began late on  Sunday night, or in the gloom of Monday morning, with the sound of phlegmatic  cursing&mdash;softened and chastened by distance and the enfolding darkness&mdash;the  yapping of busy dogs, the pathetic lowing of weary beasts, the marching of many  hoofs, the slow movements of big flocks and herds on the ironstone road.</p>
<p>On Sunday evening Waddy was a  mile-long township facing an apparently interminable post-and-rail fence and a  wide stretch of treeless country dotted with poppet-legs&mdash;a township of some  fifty houses, a Sunday-school and a chapel; grey, weatherboard, rain-washed  houses, and an old, bleached, wooden day-school shored up on either side with stays,  but lurching forward and peering stupidly out of its painted windows with a  ludicrous suggestion of abject drunkenness. On Sunday evening Waddy was still,  silent, and apparently deserted, oppressed by the weight of a Cousin-Jack  Sabbath, but on Monday morning tents and covered carts linked the scattered  houses, camp-fires smoked everywhere, and bearded cattle-men, making their  scant toilet under the decent cover of a cart-wheel or a rail-fence, enlivened  the place with light-hearted blasphemy and careless snatches of song, whilst  flocks of sheep drifted on the common, fraternizing with the local goats, and  mobs of cattle came slowly down the old toll-road, sniffing at the bare, brown  track; the dust-coloured, sleepy drovers, with sunken heads, nodding on their  limp horses.</p>
<p>Tuesday was sale-day. Monday  afternoon was devoted to the yarding of cattle and the yarding and drafting of  innumerable sheep&mdash;the former a comparatively easy and decorous undertaking; the  latter a clamorous and arduous business provocative of disgust, dust, and  madness, and inducing a thirst that afflicts the toiler like a visible disease,  making him an object of pity to all humane beholders. The average bullock is of  incalculable mental density, but he has the virtue of faith, and if you wish  him to go through a gateway he goes in blind confidence; but you may pack a mob  of five or fifty thousand sheep hard against a 10 ft. opening in a fence, and  you may yap yourself hoarse, and beat your trousers to rags, and your dogs may  bark their lungs up, without inducing a single monumental idiot of the whole  flock to venture through.</p>
<p>It is a hot afternoon&mdash;it always  was a hot afternoon, it seems to me at this distance&mdash;and scores of thousands of  sheep are being hauled, and bullied, and cursed, and cajoled into the yards,  and from pen to pen. There is a decided substratum of sound&mdash;the ceaseless,  senseless bleating of sheep, low and unvarying; above this the &ldquo;yap, yap, yap&rdquo;  of the men and boys, the sharp barking of the dogs, and the lowing of the cattle  in the high yards beyond. Over all, the dust and the sun&mdash;a burning, yellow sun,  and a rolling cloud of powdery dust&mdash;and everywhere in the air the taint of  sheep, the pungent smell of the beasts, and the taste of them if you open your  lips to breathe. It is a great time for several of the boys of Waddy; it means  half a day from school and the opportunity of earning a shilling or two playing  at work. Every healthy boy in the township is ambitious to be a drover, and  have a black pipe, a wonderful horse, and a fabulous dog. Working at the yards  is an approach to the ideal, and confers a dignity obtainable in no other way.  To the boys penned in the stuffy little drunken schoolhouse the others who have  a job at the yards are kings, and objects of an envy unspeakable. They command  humble service, and awe, and admiration always.</p>
<p>With treasured whips, home-made  of many fragments, the boys are busy helping with the drafting and penning of  the cattle, or, coated half an inch deep with yellow dust, they are rushing the  sheep up and down, bleary black patches indicating where their eyes may be, and  muddy circles the probable situation of their mouths. It is hot, hard work,  but, oh! the glory of it, and the pride of walking home with money in one&rsquo;s  pockets, and covered with heaped-up, honourable dirt!</p>
<p>On sale-day the <em>Drovers&rsquo;  Arms</em> is hemmed in with conveyances of all sorts and sizes, each with a  sober horse or two tethered to a wheel, dreaming with drooped heads under the  scorching sun, or patiently foraging for the last oat in the corner of the  feed-box. The heat is the same, so are the dust and the smells, but the noises  of yesterday are supplemented by the continuous rattle of the auctioneers&rsquo;  voices. Over the simmering stew sound the voices like the crackling of gum-twigs  in an open fire:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fo&rsquo;rteen T! fo&rsquo;rteen T!  fo&rsquo;rteen T!<br>
  &ldquo;All done eighteen, done eighteen, done eighteen!<br>
  &ldquo;Fo&rsquo;r pounds, I&rsquo;m bid. Fo&rsquo;r two six! fo&rsquo;r two six!<br>
  &ldquo;Fo&rsquo;r two six! Goin&rsquo; for&mdash;two&mdash;six!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are a few &ldquo;drunks&rdquo; sleeping  in attitudes of absurd abandon along M&rsquo;Mahon&rsquo;s fence, coated with flies; and  out on the common, with the whole waste to themselves, two men, stripped to the  buff, are engaging in a dull, boozy, interminable fight. They have been  fighting ineptly for many hours, and their punctilious observance of the rules  of the ring is the wildest farce; but the comedy is wasted on Waddy, and the  drovers are too busy to give heed.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the cattle begin  to move out again and off by the roads they came, but the babel continues, and  the buyers&mdash;stout, red, bibulous men of one pronounced type&mdash;follow the  auctioneers in knots along the platforms over the yards. The cattle are not the  meek, weary animals of yesterday; they have been hustled from one yard to  another, rushed around, whipped and prodded, packed into small pens, and cursed  and orated over to the complete loss of their few poor wits, and there is now a  decided note of revolt in the lowing that rises up from the yards like a  lingering curse. In every lot turned out there are one or two beasts filled  with blind, blundering hate; they swing up the road, leading the mobs, red-eyed  and possessed of devils; cords of saliva hang from their muzzles, and their  moaning is ominous, suggesting the vacuous complaining of a maniac.</p>
<p>The youngsters coming from school  keep close to the rail-fence, but they delight to run deadly risks, and fill  the air with the profane shrieks of the drovers. Often a goaded, homicidal  bullock bolts, and then young hearts are glad. It is wonderful sport to behold  that frantic race for the distant timber&mdash;the long, rolling plunge of the  bullock, with the good horse working on his shoulder, and the volleying whip  kicking up dust and hair from his hollow ribs.</p>
<p>The clatter of the auctioneers  grows fainter and hoarser, and the perishing beasts in the pens below toss up  their heads like the branches of wind-blown trees, and push hither and thither  ceaselessly with a pitiful &ldquo;mooing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marks is selling a pen of  Bellman&rsquo;s stock in No. 26. The buyers cluster about him on top of the fence,  and bidding is brisk. One bullock, a fine red beast, has knocked himself about  badly; his tail has been torn clean away, one horn is cracked close to the  head, and the thick red blood oozes out, and blackens rolling sluggishly down  the white blaze of his face. It is a large yard, and there is plenty of room  for the brute to charge, which he does several times, now and then driving  blindly into another bullock, but generally cracking his skull sharply on the  great posts of the fence. Suddenly a portly, helmeted buyer, leaning over to  get a better view, misses his centre of gravity and goes after it, the whole 16  st. plumping solidly into the slush of the yard below. The red bullock is at  him instantly. The good horn takes Langley  in the back of the trousers, and the drive rips him bare to the collar, leaving  him unmarked, but prone, in a condition of unseemly nudity.</p>
<p>The beast backs away for another  drive, shaking his head and uttering his low, tigerish bellow, the expression  of all malevolence; but at the same moment a figure drops smartly from the  platform, and a ragged, smudgy, red-headed small boy is riding astride the  animal&rsquo;s neck, diverting his attention by battering him over the eyes with an  old felt hat. Dicky Haddon has performed this feat often for his own amusement,  to the amazement of staid and matronly cows, but this is a beast of another  colour, and the trick is done in response to an involuntary heroic impulse.</p>
<p>The bullock backs about the yard,  tossing his head in an effort to be rid of his mysterious burden, and many  hands clutch stout old Langley  from the other pen, and tow him along through the mire to the gate, the bottom  rail of which is high enough from the ground to enable them to pull him out of  danger. Then he is borne away, unnerved and invertebrate. The boy seizes his  opportunity, drops from the bullock and slips under the gate like a cat. Then  he follows Langley,  and stands in eager expectance whilst the damaged grazier is being bundled into  his buggy. Really Langley  suffers from nothing more serious than blue funk, but is oblivious of  everything excepting a great craving for neat brandy, and is driven off without  bestowing even a glance on his small preserver.</p>
<p>This base ingratitude inspires  the youth with a loathing that can only be expressed in the choice idiom of the  yards, and the disappointed hero, dancing in the road with his thumb to his  nose, yells bitter and profane insults after Jabez Langley, moneyed man and  M.L.A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ASabbathMornatWaddy"></a>A Sabbath Morn at Waddy</h2>
<p>Sunday-School&nbsp;was  &ldquo;in&rdquo; at Waddy. The classes were all in place, and of the teachers only Brother  Spence was absent, strange to say. This was the first Sunday of the new  superintendent&rsquo;s term, always an evil time for grace, and a season of  sulkiness, and bickering, and bad blood. Each beloved brother coveted the  dignity of the office, and those who failed to get it were consumed with envy  and all uncharitableness for many Sabbaths after. Some deserted the little  wooden chapel on the hill till the natural emotions of prayerful men pent in their  bosoms could no longer be borne, and then they stole back, one by one, and  condoned in hurricanes of exhortation with rain and thunder.</p>
<p>Brother Nehemiah Best occupied  the seat of office behind a deal table on the small platform, under faded  floral decorations left since last anniversary. Rumour declared that Brother  Best was unable to write his own name, and whispered that he spent laborious  nights learning the hymns by heart before he could give them out on Sunday, as  witness the fact that he &ldquo;read&rdquo; with equal facility whether the book was  straight, or end-ways, or upside down. Brother Best was thin-voiced, weak in  wind, and resourceless and unconvincing in prayer. No wonder Brother Spence was  disgusted. Brother Spence could write his own name with scarcely more effort  than it cost him to swing the trucks at the Phoenix; his voice raised in prayer set the  loose shingles fairly dancing on the old roof; and his recitation of &ldquo;The  Drunkard&rsquo;s Doom&rdquo; had been the chief attraction on Band of Hope nights for years  past. Ernest Spence had not hesitated to express himself freely at Friday  evening&rsquo;s meeting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, they Brother Best, he no  more fit for pourin&rsquo; out the spirit, you, than a blin&rsquo; kitten. Look at the  chest of en!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True for en, Ernie!&rdquo; cried  Brother Tresize.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They old devil, you, he laugh at  Best&rsquo;s prayin&rsquo;, sureli. Brother Spence some tuss, you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Brother Spence had left the  meeting in a state of righteous indignation. Yet here were Brothers Tresize,  and Tregaskis, and Prator, and Pearce, and Eddy. True, they all looked grim and  unchastened, and there was an uneasy, shifty feeling in the chapel that  inspired boys and girls, young men and young women, teachers and choir, with  great expectations. Brother Best, in his favourite attitude, with one arm behind  him under his coat tails, his right hand holding the book a yard from his eyes,  his right foot thrust well out, the toe touching the floor daintily, made his  first official announcement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will open they service this  mornin&rsquo; by singing hymn won, nought, won.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in a nasal sing-song,  swinging with a long sweep from toe to heel and heel to toe, he gave out the  first verse and the chorus, ending unctuously with a smack of the lips at the  line:</p>
<p align="center">Thou beautiful, beautiful Poley Star!</p>
<p>Nehemiah was a dairyman, and had  a fixed conviction that the poley star and a poley cow had much in common.</p>
<p>The hymn being sung, the  superintendent engaged in prayer, speaking weakly, with a wearisome repetition  of stock phrases, eked out with laboured groans and random cries.</p>
<p>Brother Tresize could not  disguise his cynical disgust, and remained mute. A prayer to be successful  amongst the Wesleans of Waddy must make the hearers squirm and wriggle upon  their knees, and cry aloud. Brothers and sisters were all happy when moved to  wild sobbing, to the utterance of moans, and groans, and hysterical appeals to  heaven, and when impelled to sustain a sonorous volley by the vigorous use of  pocket handkerchiefs; but that was a spiritual treat that came only once in a  while, with the visit of a specialist, or when the spirit moved Brother Spence  or Brother Tresize to unusual fervor.</p>
<p>The superintendent&rsquo;s prayer did  not raise a single qualm; and the boys of Class II. straggled openly over the  forms, pinched each other, and passed such rubbish as they could collect to  Dicky Haddon, the pale, saintly, ginger-headed boy at the top of the class, who  was in honour bound to drop everything so sent him in amongst the mysteries of  the old, yellow, guttural harmonium, through a convenient crack in the back.</p>
<p>Throughout the service Brother  Best, proud of his new office, watched the scholars diligently, visiting little  boys and girls with sudden sharp raps or twitches of the ear if they dared even  to sneeze, but judiciously overlooking much that was injurious and unbecoming  in the bigger boys of Class II., who had a vicious habit of sullenly kicking  elderly shins when cuffed or wigged for their misdeeds.</p>
<p>The Bible reading, with  wonderful, original expositions of the obscure passages by horny-handed miners,  occupied about half an hour, and then the superintendent stilled the racket and  clatter of stowing away the tattered books with an authoritative hand, and  invited Brother Tresize to pray. If he was great he could be merciful.</p>
<p>Brother Tresize made his preparations  with great deliberation, spreading a handkerchief large enough for a bed-cover  to save the knees of his sacred black-cloth trousers, hitching up the latter to  prevent bagging, and finally loosening his paper collar from the button in  front to give free vent to his emotions&mdash;and preserve the collar. Then, the  rattling of feet, the pushing and shoving, the coughing and whispering and  sniffing having subsided, and all being on their knees, Brother Tresize began  his prayer in a soft, low, reverent voice that speedily rose to a reverberant  roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gwad, ah! look down upon we  here, ah; let the light of Thy countenance ahluminate, ah, this little corner  of Thy vineyard, ah. Oh, Gwad, ah! be merciful to they sinners what be  assembled here, ah; pour down Thy speerit upon they, ah, make they whole, ah.  Oh, Gwad, ah! Thoo knowest they be some here, ah, that be wallerin&rsquo; in sin, ah,  some that be hippycrits, ah, some that be cheats, ah, some that be scoffers,  an&rsquo; misbelievers, an&rsquo; heathens, oh, Gwad, ah! Have mercy on they people, oh,  Gwad, ah! Show they Thy fires, ah, an&rsquo; turn they from the wrath, oh, Loord  Gwad, ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Tresize was evidently in  fine form this morning; already the windows were vibrating before the  concussions of his tremendous voice, and the floor bounded under the great  blows that punctuated his sentences. As he went on, the air became electrical,  and the spirit moved amongst the flock. The women felt it first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Gwad, ah!&rdquo; interjected Mrs.  Eddy from her corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throw up the windies, an&rsquo; let  the speerit in!&rdquo; sobbed Mrs. Eddy.</p>
<p>Brother Prator blew his nose with  a loud report, a touching and helpful manifestation.</p>
<p>Brother Tresize prayed with every  atom of energy he possessed. His opinion was on record:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good prayer Sunday mornin&rsquo;,  you, takes it out of en more&rsquo;n a hard shift in a hot drive, you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his proper momentum was  attained he oscillated to and fro between the floor and the form, swaying back  over his heels till his head almost touched the boards&mdash;a gymnastic feat that  was the envy of all the brethren&mdash;he shook his clenched fist at the rafters and  reached his highest note. The plunge forward was accompanied by falling tones,  and ended with a blow on the form that made every article of furniture in the  building jump. The perspiration ran in streams down his face and neck; dry sobs  broke from his labouring chest; long strands of his moist, well-oiled, red hair  separated themselves from the flattened mass and stood out like feelers, to the  wild, ungodly delight of Class II.; and whilst he prayed the brethren and  &ldquo;sistern&rdquo; kept up a continuous fire of interjections and heartrending groans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They be people here, ah! what is  careless of Thy grace; chasten &rsquo;em with fire an&rsquo; brimstone&mdash;chasten &rsquo;em, oh,  Lord, ah! They be those of uz what go to be Thy servants, oh, Gwad, ah! an&rsquo; to  do Thy work here below, ah, what is tried an&rsquo; found wantin&rsquo;, ah&mdash;some do water  they milk, oh, Gwad, ah! an&rsquo; some do be misleadin&rsquo; they neighbors&rsquo; hens to lay  away. Smite they people for Thy glory, oh, Loord, ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great moaning filled the  chapel, and all heads turned towards Brother Nehemiah Best, kneeling at his  chair, with his face buried in his hands, trembling violently. Nehemiah, two  years earlier, had been fined for watering the milk sold to his town customers;  quite recently he had been thrown into the Phoenix slurry by an unregenerate trucker,  who accused him of beguiling his hens to lay from home. Brother Tresize was  wrestling with the superintendent in prayer, and the excitement rose instantly  to fever heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They what do not as they wad be  done by, pursue &rsquo;em, ah; smite they with Thy right hand, oh, Lord Gwad, ah! so  they may be turned from they wickedness, ah. They what have better food to they  table for theyselves than for they children or they wives, ah, they what be  filled with vanity, ah, they what havin&rsquo; no book-learnin&rsquo; do deceive Thy  people, an&rsquo; fill the seats o&rsquo; the learned, ah, deal with such, oh, Gwad, ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brother Tresize was now almost  frantic with the ecstasy of his zeal. His exhortation was continued in this  strain, and every word was a lance to prick the cowering superintendent. The  women sniffed and sobbed, the men groaned and cried &ldquo;Ahmen, ah!&rdquo; It was a great  time for grace.</p>
<p>But suddenly a new voice broke  in&mdash;a shrill, thin voice, splitting into that of Brother Tresize like a  steam-whistle. Brother Best had assumed the defensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lord, ah!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;give  no ear to they what bears false witness against they neighbors, to they what  backbite, ah, an&rsquo; slander, ah, an&rsquo; bear malice, ah; heed they not, oh, Lord,  ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abel Tresize rose to the  occasion. It was a battle. His voice swelled till it rivalled the roar of the  ravening lion; he no longer selected his words or cared to make himself  understood of the people; it was necessary only to smother Brother Best, to  pray him down, and Abel prayed as no man had ever prayed before at Waddy. A  curious crowd&mdash;the Irish children, Dan the Drover, an old shepherd, and a few  cattlemen from the Red Cow&mdash;attracted by the great commotion, had assembled in  the porch, and were gazing in open-mouthed, delighted.</p>
<p>Tresize persevered, but Best&rsquo;s  shrill, penetrating voice rang out distinctly above all. Brother Best was  transformed, inspired; under the influence of his great wrath he had waxed  eloquent; he smote his enemy hip and thigh, he heaped coals of fire upon his  head, and marshalled St. Peter and all the angels against him.</p>
<p>The severity of his exertions was  telling heavily upon Abel Tresize; he was dreadfully hoarse, his great hands  fell upon the form without emphasis, he was almost winded, and his legs wobbled  under him. He pulled himself together for another effort, and the cry that he  uttered thrilled every heart, but it quite exhausted him, and he went over  backwards, striking his head upon the floor, and lay in the aisle convulsed in  a fit.</p>
<p>Instantly the chapel became a  babel. The teachers ran to Brother Tresize, and bore him into the open air, the  wondering children crowding after, and left the new superintendent sobbing on  his table like a broken-hearted boy.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheTruckersDream"></a>The Trucker&rsquo;s Dream</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I&nbsp;had&nbsp;a  divil of a drame last night,&rdquo; said Bart O&rsquo;Brien, as he crowded his usual  two-pound &ldquo;plaster&rdquo; of cold fried bacon and bread into his crib-bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Drame,&rsquo; d&rsquo;ye call it?&rdquo; muttered  Brown from his bunk. &ldquo;I thouoht you had the buckin&rsquo; fantods; you howled like a  madman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be Hiven, I don&rsquo;t wonder thin. I  thought I was pumpin&rsquo; away in the place below there, whin thim two sets at the  bottom av the incline came away, an&rsquo; I saw Lane crushed under thim. His dead  face was starin&rsquo; out av the heap at me, all battered an&rsquo; bloody, an&rsquo; ghost-like  in the candle-light. Faith, an&rsquo; I ain&rsquo;t much amused wid these lone shifts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys grinned at O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s  fears, but Gleeson muttered something about the manager being &ldquo;d&mdash;d well hanged&rdquo;  for not giving an eye to that timber, and Gleeson was considered an authority.</p>
<p>Bartholomew O&rsquo;Brien was a  Bungaree native. In Bungaree the natives are more Milesian than the Irish. Bart  had for Father Cassidy a great, childlike veneration that the ribald stories  told of His Reverence by Bart&rsquo;s sceptical hut-mates could not shake; and his  belief in the wonders and mysteries of his religion and the folklore of his  mother&rsquo;s country was profound. Bartholomew had also ruddy cheeks, and an  unreliable heart.</p>
<p>It was Sunday evening at Waddy,  hot and thirst-provoking. His mates were lounging about in their trousers on  the tumbled bunks, but O&rsquo;Brien was due on the plat at nine o&rsquo;clock, and was  dressed in his working clothes. He was a trucker at the Hand-in-Hand, and it  was his turn to go below into the mine and pump the water over the incline at  the head of the main drive on the lower level. Every Sunday night, after the  long shift off, this work had to be done by one of the truckers, so that the  face might be dry for the first night-shift, coming on at one a.m. None of the  boys liked the job&mdash;O&rsquo;Brien hated it. In the presence of a tangible danger he  was as game a fellow as any in the district, but his superstition&mdash;an  ineradicable inheritance intensified by early influences that bring the emotional  side of the unlettered believer to an unhealthy development, and leave to the  man the reasoning faculties of the child&mdash;made him little more than an  irresponsible idiot when his imagination ran riot amongst the spooks and  wraiths. He had an extraordinary stock of mottoes, religious and legendary, for  warding off the spirits, and possessed all the portable charms obtainable; but  his faith was not as powerful as his fears, and, in spite of these spiritual  arms and armour, he dreaded to be alone in the murderous old mine with the  ghosts of its many dead.</p>
<p>On going to the bottom level that  night, and threading the course of the long, tortuous main drive, the trucker  found the water below the incline higher than usual. The heavy iron pump stood  over a slab-covered well in a small chamber about ten feet by six, dug in the  side of the drive. It was worked with a back-racking up-and-down stroke, and  lifted the water into pipes, which carried it to the higher ground, whence it  drained to the shaft. The face was quite a thousand yards from the plat; and  the sound from the air-pipe, like the laborious breathing of some gigantic  animal afar off, offered no relief from the oppressive stillness and the  deathly atmosphere of the drive.</p>
<p>It is a trying thing to a man  afflicted with the accumulated superstitions of a hundred generations to be  left alone for any time in the deep, extensive workings of an old mine, every  drive, and winze, and shoot in which has its tale of blood and suffering. Bart  O&rsquo;Brien stuck his candle to the side of the chamber, and paused to listen. The  terror was already strong upon him: his mouth was dry, and his heart beat like  a plunger, catching his breath at every pulsation. The chamber was deep enough  down and hot enough to suggest its proximity to the flaming home of all the  damned devils in whose existence Bartholomew implicitly believed. He had done  solitary duty several times at the pump, but never before had his horror of it  been so great as to-night. His dream recurred to him, and he glanced uneasily  towards the suspicious sets. He was a believer in the portents of dreams&mdash;he  expected something to come of this one.</p>
<p>Catching at the long handle, Bart  began to pump, almost in desperation. Up and down, up and down&mdash;there was relief  in action, and he worked fiercely. The pump had been oiled recently, and ran  smoothly and noiselessly. This irritated him&mdash;he wanted hard work, something  material to fight with. And then the &ldquo;click, clack,&rdquo; would have gone well to  the rhythm of an ancient Irish rhyme which his old mother held to be infallible  in keeping the elves from cows, and which he was wont to mutter all the time  when beset by supernatural enemies.</p>
<p>So hard was the mental battle  O&rsquo;Brien was fighting that bodily pain or weariness never obtruded. With bent head  and tightly-closed eyes he toiled at the big pump, whilst the perspiration  streamed from him and ran through the folds of his scant clothing. Sometimes  the face of Geordie Lane,  corpse-white and bloodstained, as he had seen it in his dream, thrust itself  upon him; then his brows met in cords, his hands gripped the iron with a force  that split his callous fingers, the handle took a quicker, longer sweep, and  the water boiled and foamed into the wooden gutter in the drive.</p>
<p>Bart worked in this manner till about  half-past eleven; then he was startled by a gurgling, choking sound in the well  beneath his feet, and fell back into one corner of the chamber with an  exclamation, his eyes staring, full of fear.</p>
<p>The pump was drawing air! He had  done four hours&rsquo; hard work in little over half the time. The drive was dry.</p>
<p>The young man&rsquo;s left arm was  rubbed raw from the elbow to the wrist, and his indurated hands were bleeding  profusely from several deep cracks. Bart gazed at the blood stupidly, and  presently found himself listening again&mdash;listening in the profound silence, out  of which he heard at length the distinct patter of footsteps. Small flakes of  clay were falling from the roof of the drive on to the muddy floor, but what  little reasoning power Bart had was lost by this time in a passion of  superstitious fear. He clutched the pump-handle once more, but it rose and fell  loosely, with a clatter, and drew no water.</p>
<p>With nothing for his hands to do,  O&rsquo;Brien was no longer able to control his thoughts; they ran over the history  of the mine&mdash;its list of killed. He recalled the story of Martin&rsquo;s ghost  haunting the old balance-shaft, whilst the spirit of his wife, who died of  grief, sought for him after every shift in the next level. He remembered with  startling vividness Rooke, the braceman, as he looked spread upon the  plat-sheets after falling down five hundred feet of shaft&mdash;battered into a  horrible mass, out of which the face stood forth, ghastly white, and unmarked,  though the brain was laid bare as cleanly as by surgeon&rsquo;s saw. Then passed  before his eyes in grisly procession, showing their fearful wounds&mdash;Bill the  trucker, killed at No. 5 by a fall; Carter, brained in the shaft; Praer and  Hopkins, smashed in the runaway cage; Moore and German Harry, blown up in the  well when sinking; and Lane, pinched under the shattered timber right before  his eyes there in the drive.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien was crouching in the  corner. No longer understanding that it was only in a dream he had seen Lane  killed, he expected a ghost to start up before his eyes&mdash;a ghost with mangled  limbs and a pale, blood-stained face. He remained thus for some time, fighting  the dread as it grew upon him. At length he started up, and his fear found vent  in a yell that echoed shrilly through the workings. He meant to rush into the  drive and make his way to the shaft, but struck his head against the  pump-handle at the first stride, and was hurled back into the water, which had  risen again to the height of several inches.</p>
<p>The blow and the drenching  steadied Bart a little, and he started pumping once more, with nervous energy.  Whilst he worked, the candle fell from the wall and hissed out in the wet clay.  He had no matches. In a few minutes the pump was drawing wind again, and now  O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s greatest trial began.</p>
<p>The darkness was solid,  substantial&mdash;the young man felt it weighing upon him with a pressure as of deep  water, and his sense of solitude and awe was such as might be known by the  last, lone man in a waste, sunless world. At times he crushed his ears with his  hands to shut out the dreadful silence, and then he heard the passing of spirit  feet, the muffled beat of wings, sobbing sounds, and long moans dying away  beyond the distant curves. His treacherous eyes saw fleeting forms and tense,  inhuman faces traced in faint, phosphorescent lines on the dense, black wall  that stood up before him. His agonized fears had now obtained complete mastery  of him, his mind ran in a frenzy from horror to horror, and an intolerable  dread filled his soul with hellish expectations.</p>
<p>He stood transfixed at the back  of the chamber, his arms outspread, his fingers dug knuckle-deep in the sodden  reef. His eyes stared as in death, and his mouth was open wide, the fallen  lower jaw jerking spasmodically. His greatest terror was of the thing he had  seen at the chamber-door&mdash;the corpse-face under the splintered timbers. He saw  it now, white as quartz, with clots of blood hiding the eyes; he <em>felt</em> its  presence&mdash;it mouthed at him&mdash;threatened him.</p>
<p>Out of the darkness and the  silence of death came a faint rumbling sound, like far-off thunder. It swelled  and drew nearer. It roared in the drive, and from the inky blackness, in a pale  yellow light, Lane rose up with a bloody face, and caught at O&rsquo;Brien.</p>
<p>A minute or two later the men of  the night-shift were shocked to meet Lane rushing back from the face like a  maniac, with a dead man in his truck.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thoo&rsquo;s got a bad  cut i&rsquo; tha head thasel,&rsquo; lad,&rdquo; said the boss of the shift to Lane, half an hour  later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I slipped  into that crab-hole at the second curve going up, and knocked my forehead on  the truck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="HebeofGrasstree"></a>Hebe of Grasstree</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;change&nbsp;had  come over the spirit of Grasstree; there was a false note in the gaiety of the  men up from Ramrod Flat, and the young fellows in the pastoral interest around  on the Black Cockatoo, when they foregathered in Cleever&rsquo;s bar, discovered an  un-accustomed awkwardness and restraint in their attitudes towards each other.  With miners and bushmen alike confidence had given place to suspicion, and  good-fellowship to an all-round surliness.</p>
<p>For a time the men could not  account even to themselves for this strange alteration; an attempt was made to  make the climate responsible, and a few insisted that it was something in the  drink, but certainly all had become &ldquo;sudden and quick in quarrel&rdquo;&mdash;hats went  down and hands went up on the slightest provocation. Men whose ordinary  work-a-day friendship had previously heightened to brotherly love under the  warming influence of alcohol now became profane and bitter in drink, and short  arguments terminated with a rush and a collision in the bar. Little differences  that might previously have been settled by mutual concessions were now nursed  and coddled till they grew into hot enmities, and even Foster and Brierly, once  the best of mates, were camping apart and each working a lone hand at Goat  Creek.</p>
<p>Eventually Hefty Maconochie was  generally recognized as the disturbing element at the Grasstree, but, by tacit  agreement, that fact was not publicly admitted. Possibly a delicate and  chivalrous consideration for &ldquo;Miss Mack&rsquo;s&rdquo; sensibilities inspired this polite  reticence, but perhaps it chiefly arose from the shamefacedness of her  worshippers. The man out-back, secretive in most things personal, will admit  any weakness or wickedness ere confessing to the pangs of unrequited passion.  Hence when Hetty was particularly affable to Stacey on Monday evening in the  bar, and allowed Riverton to monopolize her smiles on Tuesday evening, Riverton  and Stacey fought a desperate and bloody battle on the Wednesday afternoon to  decide the ownership of a one-eyed dog which was the local head depot for  fleas, and which really belonged to a third man, who, being public-spirited,  waived his claim rather than spoil sport. Riverton won the dog.</p>
<p>Of course Miss Maconochie was quite  conscious that she had introduced a new element into the relationship of things  at the Grasstree, but, although exultant in the knowledge that the men were  contending with animal ferocity for her favour, she appeared always quite  oblivious, and was genial or distant with the discrimination of a conscientious  barmaid.</p>
<p>Miss Mack had been sent to  the <em>Travellers&rsquo; Rest</em> from a Melbourne labour office in response to  Cleever&rsquo;s order, which specified &ldquo;a strapping girl, not more than 26, to work  and assist in bar.&rdquo; Hetty was &ldquo;strapping,&rdquo; and certainly not more than 26; five  feet seven, straight as a lath, strong, ruddy-cheeked, and possessing a  marvellous efflorescence of glorious red hair as fine as spun silk, coruscant,  throwing little subtle tendrils down about her ears, her temples, and her long  white neck. There are many female Samsons. But Hetty&rsquo;s power was not wholly in  her hair; her strength was peculiarly attractive to the men; her every action  suggested strength&mdash;strength underlying a womanly softness and roundness. She  often served in the bar on warm evenings with her sleeves rolled well above her  shapely elbows, and then Cleever&rsquo;s patrons felt it was worth the price of the  drink to see &ldquo;Mack&rdquo; reach up for the bottle. She draped lightly for comfort, and  blushed to find it fame. The average woman who puts on much to make herself  attractive does not realize that half the art is in taking off. Hetty was  innocent of coquetry when she divested herself of superfluous drapery, but she  could not remain long ignorant of the advantages she enjoyed from her  emancipation. Then her laugh helped to ensure success&mdash;it was a generous laugh,  full of suggestive music, and discovered new attractions in her large, handsome  mouth. Such a laugh is honeyed flattery for the man who provokes it, and, as  Hetty was proud of her fine white teeth, no man&rsquo;s joke was altogether a failure  in Cleever&rsquo;s bar.</p>
<p>There were other young women in  and about the Grasstree&mdash;two or three in the township, and settlers&rsquo; and  farmers&rsquo; daughters judiciously distributed over the district; but, although  these had been courted, it was in a temperate and bloodless manner. These girls  were not slow in concluding that Miss Maconochie was a person of extraordinary  deceit and peculiar morals. But Hetty was by no means a designing woman. Saving  a year spent in domestic service in an extremely Methodist household in Melbourne, her knowledge  of men and manners had been gathered in the bush township where she was born  and bred. Her morals were particularly healthy; it was soon understood by  Cleever&rsquo;s customers that &ldquo;Mack&rdquo; knew how to take care of herself&mdash;an  understanding that detracted not from the zest of the pursuit.</p>
<p>After the morbid propriety of  that Methodist household, Hetty revelled in the unrestraint and comparative  brilliancy of life at the <em>Travellers&rsquo; Rest</em>. Cleever was a widower,  and not at all exacting, and in the bar of evenings the girl received at least  a specious show of respect sufficiently gratifying to a young woman of her  intellectual limitations.</p>
<p>The first battle fell about  between Stacey and one of the Devoys. Both had been dangling over the bar,  chatting and larking with Hetty for an hour or so, when Stacey&rsquo;s glass was  upset in a bit of horse-play, and Stacey, receiving its contents over his  shirt-front, became a butt and an object of derision to all in the bar. &ldquo;Mack&rdquo;  laughed aloud, and flashed her white teeth in the lamp-light, and Devoy laughed  too, and Stacey&rsquo;s blood grew hot, and he longed for slaughter. His opportunity  came when the girl left the bar a minute later. He confronted Devoy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you, Devoy, you did that on  purpose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was entirely an accident, but  neither was in any humour for explanations. Devoy felt it was beneath him to  excuse or parley; he blurted much defiant profanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I did! Why don&rsquo;t you  drink up your liquor like a man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was cut short by a swinging,  open-hand blow. Then thud, thud, thud, thud&mdash;four quick blows, two and two, with  a sound as of a teamster banging the ribs of his bogged horses with a  shovel&mdash;and Stacey and Devoy were fighting with the ferocity of tigers at  mating-time.</p>
<p>Hetty returned to the bar to see  the first blow struck, and now, leaning over the counter, with sparkling eyes,  glowing cheeks, and heaving breast she watched the fight. There was none of the  impassivity of the lolling tigress in her attitude: she burned with excitement;  she clenched her own hands, and bruised her knuckles on the boards; she  followed each swift, cutting blow, and uttered inarticulate cries of wonder.</p>
<p>The men fought without science,  fought with the brutality of powerful men, wounding with every blow, but  feeling nothing in their heat and fury. A ring of onlookers circled round them,  and outside this ring danced Cleever&mdash;&ldquo;Fighting&rdquo; Cleever&mdash;with his &ldquo;peacemaker,&rdquo;  a wicked-looking &ldquo;waddy,&rdquo; eager to get in a blow and stun one of the  combatants, for the peace of Devil&rsquo;s End and the credit of the house.</p>
<p>The fight was not settled in  Cleever&rsquo;s bar. Two or three rounds served to exhaust the blind fury of the  combatants, and then mutual friends interceded, and a formal meeting was  arranged for next day. A two hours&rsquo; struggle in Haddon&rsquo;s grass paddock on the  following afternoon ended in the defeat of Stacey, and that night Devoy  appeared before Hetty Maconochie, bruised, bandaged, and badly hacked about,  but big with victory. The fight was not discussed, but the girl quite  understood, and the conquering hero rejoiced in her luminous smile, and was  sullenly given the pride of place by his companions, who tacitly admitted this  right to the victor for the time being.</p>
<p>After that fistic battles were  daily occurrences at Devil&rsquo;s End. Callaghan, the solitary constable of the  district, made a gallant attempt to cope with the press of business, but after  an exhausting week yielded to public opinion and was officially blind and deaf  when the battle-cries were heard at the <em>Travellers&rsquo; Rest</em>. Presently  every second man in the district possessed black eyes, split lips, or a swollen  ear, or all these things, and the local chemist did a roaring trade in court-plaster  and Friar&rsquo;s balsam. The men fought on the slightest provocation, or with no  obvious provocation at all; arguments on religion or politics invariably ended  in bloodshed; mates in the drives below disagreed as to the proper locality for  a &ldquo;shot,&rdquo; and came blaspheming up the shafts to &ldquo;settle it&rdquo; in a &ldquo;mill;&rdquo; the  boys at &ldquo;Old Burgoo&rsquo;s&rdquo; fought viciously to maintain their superiority as  horsemen and shearers, and always the victorious pugilist turned up at  Cleever&rsquo;s, in all the glory of his wounds and bruises, to invite the admiration  of the creamy-skinned goddess with the brown eyes.</p>
<p>Grasstree had discovered Hetty  Maconochie. Previously she had received a reasonable amount of attention from  the men with whom she was thrown in contact, but Grasstree had made her a  sensation&mdash;a craze. She gloried and revelled in her success, and the sense of  pride and power it gave her. Thinking over it through the day, she laughed with  rapturous delight, and felt like a queen amongst her pans. Cleever did well  these times: there were no tee-totallers left in and about Grasstree, and  the <em>Travellers&rsquo; Rest</em> had absorbed all the business of the  district. Being in love with Hetty himself, Cleever made an effort to dispense  with her help in the bar, and excited an instantaneous revolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch out the girl,&rdquo; was the  general demand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve travelled down here to be served by a  splay-mouthed Dutchman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cleever was a Swede; but Swedes,  Norwegians, Danes, Belgians, Germans, Austrians, and men of Holland are all Dutchmen out-back. Other  foreigners are invariably Frenchmen. If Hetty was not produced on demand there  was no more drinking, but much disorder and many accidents, and the proprietor  was always compelled to yield. Cleever fought with the rest. He fought without  science or discrimination, and nobody took any satisfaction from an encounter  with the &ldquo;Dutchman.&rdquo; He never knew when he was beaten, and had a ridiculous and  disconcerting way of resuming the battle, without word or warning, a day, a  week, or a month after being egregiously whipped. Being a foreigner, he did not  allow any absurd sentiment to interfere with his manner of fighting, and  repudiated British prejudices and British reverence for rule and precedent, and  fought with all his weapons&mdash;fists, nails, teeth, and feet. There was no credit  in beating Cleever; he couldn&rsquo;t fight, but he was always willing to try, and,  although he was considered wildly humorous in his tantrums, his opponents  rarely escaped an injury of some kind or another before the battle was ended.</p>
<p>After much indiscriminate  fighting, in the course of a couple of months it was understood and admitted  without argument that the final must be contested by Riverton and Devoy. Both  were unbeaten, and each would have done battle with a raging lion for the love  of Hetty Maconochie. Cleever alone, of all the whipped candidates, refused to  abandon his hopes of winning his handsome Hebe, and was quite willing to &ldquo;take  on&rdquo; the two last aspirants one after the other or both together. The other men  of Grasstree, and Ramrod Flat, and Grecian Bend admitted themselves &ldquo;out of  it,&rdquo; and it was quite understood that the winner of the Riverton-Devoy contest  had only to step up and take possession of the prize. This view had never been  questioned; Hetty&rsquo;s keen interest in the many battles, and her evident delight  in the knowledge that she was the prize in the greatest competition that had  ever shaken an Australian bush township out of its habitual quietude and  lethargy, were taken as indicating her acquiescence. Certainly both Devoy and  Riverton took it for granted that the best man of the two was destined to marry  the belle of Grasstree.</p>
<p>The great fight came off on a  beautiful pitch under Grecian Bend on a Tuesday morning, and half the male  population of the district was there to see. Devoy and Riverton fought because  the latter had ventured before witnesses to assert his disbelief in the story  of Devoy&rsquo;s great shooting exploit&mdash;a wonderful narrative, never before  questioned at Grasstree. The fight was long and stubborn. Both men were young,  strong, hardened with toil, active, game as peccaries, six-foot and a bit, and  fighting for an issue that seemed dear as dear life.</p>
<p>They fought bare-knuckled and  stripped to the buff. There was no sparring and no vain display; every blow cut  or bruised; and during the first half-dozen rounds the great toughened, knubbly  fists were going like sledge-hammers about a busy forge. After that it was a  brutal exhibition of butchery and endurance. Blood ran freely, dyeing the  combatants and darkening the grass. The faces of the fighters became  unrecognizable, and after the 13th round neither could see. By this time half  the spectators had sickened and turned away, and awaited the end at a distance.  Devoy was knocked clean out in the 19th round, and then Riverton was carried  away across three saplings, a bruised and battered champion, limp as a wet  shirt, but triumphant, and feeling drunk&mdash;happily, jubilantly drunk.</p>
<p>Riverton would have much liked to  drag himself to the <em>Travellers&rsquo; Rest</em> that night, but it was  impossible.</p>
<p>He was helpless next night, and  on the following morning his bunk still held him captive. But on Friday night,  with the assistance of his mate, he conveyed his battered carcass into  Cleever&rsquo;s bar. A woeful spectacle was the champion of Grasstree, but his wounds  were glorious. About a dozen men sat in the bar. Cleever was in attendance. The  hero called for drinks all round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Mack?&rdquo; he asked  authoritatively.</p>
<p>The publican had evaded this  query from others for two days in order to produce a good effect when the  champion appeared to claim her. He lingered over the answer now as he served  the drinks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She haf went by dot city for der  honeymoons,&rdquo; he said composedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha-at!&rdquo; Riverton sprawled upon  the counter, and his bruised face went livid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vile you vos fight mit Devoy,  she haf ride away in der coach to marry anodder feller.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marry! marry! Who&mdash;who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tommy Haynes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haynes!&rdquo; Riverton stood upright,  looking around upon his companions, but saw only blank faces.</p>
<p>Tommy Haynes was the successful  storekeeper of Grasstree, a small boyish man of 24, slight and fair, with curls  and a complexion. He would easily have stood upright under Hetty&rsquo;s extended  arm. Whilst others fought and suffered Haynes courted&mdash;courted pluckily, with  kisses and caresses and pretty presents&mdash;courted and conquered. &ldquo;Haynes!&rdquo;  repeated Riverton, with a lingering, bitter imprecation, &ldquo;that&mdash;that worm. By  the Lord! when they come back I&rsquo;ll put him over my knee and spank him before  her face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But they were two months coming,  and long before their return Riverton had thought better of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheConqueringBush"></a>The Conquering Bush</h2>
<p>Ned&nbsp;&ldquo;picked up&rdquo;  his wife in Sydney.  He had come down for a spell in town, and to relieve himself of the distress of  riches&mdash;to melt the cheque accumulated slowly in toil and loneliness on a big  station in the North. He was a stockrider, a slow, still man naturally, but  easily moved by drink. When he first reached town he seemed to have with him  some of the atmosphere of silence and desolation that surrounded him during the  long months back there on the run. Ned was about thirty-four, and looked forty.  He was tall and raw-boned, and that air of settled melancholy, which is the  certain result of a solitary bush life, suggested some romantic sorrow to Mrs.  Black&rsquo;s sentimental daughter.</p>
<p>Darton, taught wisdom by  experience, had on this occasion taken lodgings in a suburban private house.  Mrs. Black&rsquo;s home was very small, but her daughter was her only child, and they  found room for a &ldquo;gentleman boarder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet Black was a pleasant-faced,  happy-hearted girl of twenty. She liked the new boarder from the start, she  acknowledged to herself afterwards, but when by some fortunate chance he  happened to be on hand to drag a half-blind and half-witted old woman from  beneath the very hoofs of a runaway horse, somewhat at the risk of his own  neck, she was enraptured, and in the enthusiasm of the moment she kissed the  hand of the abashed hero, and left a tear glittering on the hard brown  knuckles.</p>
<p>This was a week after Ned  Darton&rsquo;s arrival in Sydney.</p>
<p>Ned went straight to his room and  sat perfectly still, and with even more than his usual gravity watched the tear  fade away from the back of his hand. Either Janet&rsquo;s little demonstration of  artless feeling had awakened suggestions of some glorious possibility in Ned&rsquo;s  heart, or he desired to exercise economy for a change; he suddenly became very  judicious in the selection of his drinks, and only took enough whisky to dispel  his native moodiness and taciturnity and make him rather a pleasant acquisition  to Mrs. Black&rsquo;s limited family circle.</p>
<p>When Ned Darton returned to his  pastoral duties in the murmuring wilds, he took Janet Black with him as his  wife. That was their honeymoon.</p>
<p>Darton did not pause to consider  the possible results of the change he was introducing into the life of his  bride&mdash;few men would. Janet was vivacious, and her heart yearned towards  humanity. She was bright, cheerful, and impressionable. The bush is sad, heavy,  despairing; delightful for a month, perhaps, but terrible for a year.</p>
<p>As she travelled towards her new  home the young wife was effervescent with joy, aglow with health, childishly  jubilant over numberless plans and projects; she returned to Sydney before the expiration of a year, a  stranger to her mother in appearance and in spirit. She seemed taller now, her  cheeks were thin, and her face had a new expression. She brought with her some  of the brooding desolation of the bush&mdash;even in the turmoil of the city she  seemed lost in the immensity of the wilderness. She answered her mother&rsquo;s every  question without a smile. She had nothing to complain of: Ned was a very good  husband and very kind. She found the bush lonesome at first, but soon got used  to it, and she didn&rsquo;t mind now. She was quite sure she was used to it, and she  never objected to returning.</p>
<p>A baby was born, and Mrs. Darton  went back with her husband to their hut by the creek on the great run, to the  companionship of bears, birds, &rsquo;possums, kangaroos, and the eternal trees. She  hugged her baby on her breast, and rejoiced that the little mite would give her  something more to do and something to think of that would keep the awful ring  of the myriad locusts out of her ears.</p>
<p>Man and wife settled down to  their choking existence again as before, without comment. Ned was used to the  bush&mdash;he had lived in it all his life&mdash;and though its influence was powerful upon  him he knew it not. He was necessarily away from home a good deal, and when at  home he was not companionable, in the sense that city dwellers know. Two  bushmen will sit together by the fire for hours, smoking and mute, enjoying  each other&rsquo;s society; &ldquo;in mute discourse&rdquo; two bushmen will ride for twenty  miles through the most desolate or the most fruitful region. People who have  lived in crowds want talk, laughter, and song. Ned loved his wife, but he  neither talked, laughed, nor sang.</p>
<p>Summer came. The babe at Mrs.  Darton&rsquo;s breast looked out on the world of trees with wide, unblinking, solemn  eyes, and never smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned,&rdquo; said Janet, one bright,  moonlight night, &ldquo;do you know that that &rsquo;possum in the big blue gum is crazy?  She has two joeys, and she has gone mad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet spent a lot of her time  sitting in the shade of the hut on a candle-box, gazing into her baby&rsquo;s large,  still eyes, listening to the noises of the bush, and the babe too seemed to  listen, and the mother fancied that their senses blended, and they both would  some day hear something awful above the crooning of the insects and the  chattering of the parrots. Sometimes she would start out of these humours with  a shriek, feeling that the relentless trees which had been bending over and  pressing down so long were crushing her at last beneath their weight.</p>
<p>Presently she became satisfied  that the laughing jackasses were mad. She had long suspected it. Why else  should they flock together in the dim evening and fill the bush with their  crazy laughter? Why else should they sit so grave and still at other times,  thinking and grieving?</p>
<p>Yes, she was soon quite convinced  that the animals and birds, even the insects that surrounded her, were mad,  hopelessly mad, all of them. The country was now burnt brown, and the hills  ached in the great heat, and the ghostly mirage floated in the hollows. In the  day-time the birds and beasts merely chummered and muttered querulously from the  deepest shades, but in the dusk of evening they raved and shrieked, and filled  the ominous bush with mad laughter and fantastic wailings.</p>
<p>It was at this time that Darton  became impressed by the peculiar manner of his wife, and a great awe stole over  him as he watched her gazing into her baby&rsquo;s eyes with that strange look of  frightened conjecture. He suddenly became very communicative; he talked a lot,  and laughed, and strove to be merry, with an indefinable chill at his heart. He  failed to interest his wife; she was absorbed in a terrible thought. The bush  was peopled with mad things&mdash;the wide wilderness of trees, and the dull, dead  grass, and the cowering hills instilled into every living thing that came under  the influence of their ineffable gloom a madness of melancholy. The bears were  mad, the &rsquo;possums, the shrieking cockatoos, the dull grey laughing jackasses  with their devilish cackling, and the ugly yellow-throated lizards that panted  at her from the rocks&mdash;all were mad. How, then, could her babe hope to escape  the influence of the mighty bush and the great white plains beyond, with their  heavy atmosphere of despair pressing down upon his defenceless head? Would he  not presently escape from her arms, and turn and hiss at her from the grass  like a vicious snake; or climb the trees, and, like a bear, cling in day-long  torpor from a limb; or, worst of all, join the grey birds on the big dead gum,  and mock at her sorrow with empty, joyless laughter?</p>
<p>These were the fears that  oppressed Janet as she watched her sad, silent baby at her breast. They grew  upon her and strengthened day by day, and one afternoon they became an  agonizing conviction. She had been alone with the dumb child for two days, and  she sat beside the hut door and watched the evening shadows thicken, with a  shadow in her eyes that was more terrible than blackest night, and when a  solitary mopoke began calling from the Bald Hill, and the jackasses set up a  weird chorus of laughter, she rose, and clasping her baby tighter to her  breast, and leaning over it to shield it from the surrounding evils, she  hurried towards the creek.</p>
<p>Janet was not in the hut when Ned  returned home half an hour later. Attracted by the howling of his dog, he  hastened to the waterhole under the great rock, and there in the shallow water  he found the bodies of his wife and child and the dull grey birds were laughing  insanely overhead.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AZealotinLabour"></a>A Zealot in Labour</h2>
<p>The creek&nbsp;was  hacked and mangled out of all semblance to a sylvan rivulet.</p>
<p>The ruin effected looked like the  work of many men. The muddy, yellow stream had been diverted from its course  several times within half a mile, and all along the banks were torn down, great  cuttings made, piles of gravel heaped up, dams built, and races dug. But the  ravisher was there&mdash;a lone man, gouging his way into a bank at the head of the  flat where it met the hill, looking a mere midge amongst the destruction he had  wrought with his two good hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humpy&rdquo; Bannon was puny and  weazened and old; he had a hump between his shoulders, and no intelligence to  speak of, but he had the spirit of a little red ant, magnified to suit his  size. He loved labour, and he had chosen Grim Creek as his vineyard. From a  miner&rsquo;s point of view Bannon was the discoverer of Grim Creek. He it was who  prospected it and found gold in it, and he was exceedingly proud of his field,  although it was a starvation hole at the best, and rewarded him for his  tremendous labours&mdash;digging, shovelling, puddling, cradling, wading in water,  and grubbing in sludge&mdash;with a few wretched pennyweights where ounces would have  been poor pay. But Humpy never thought of leaving. Wet days and fine found him,  smeared with clays of many colours, struggling in a wet shaft or delving at the  banks, full of enthusiasm, without resource, without horse sense, but all grit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave the creek?&rdquo; he would say  in answer to the advice of casual visitors. &ldquo;Why, where&rsquo;d I go ter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s some good gold  gettin&rsquo; at Black Cap, an&rsquo; I hear about somethin&rsquo; worth prospectin&rsquo; ten miles  out by Double-U Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fear! you don&rsquo;t catch me  leavin&rsquo; the creek. Why, some o&rsquo; them minin&rsquo; sharks from the city would be down  here an&rsquo; jump the claim afore I&rsquo;d bin gone a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump <em>this</em> show,  Humpy! Why, there is not gold enough in a mile of it to buy a peanut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bannon couldn&rsquo;t restrain his  temper when the creek&mdash;<em>his</em> creek&mdash;was disparaged, and at this point  always became incoherent between extravagant predictions as to the fabulous  richness of the wash he was going to cut presently and insulting reflections  upon the intelligence of the maligner, and he would fall to working again more  fiercely than ever, jigging his old head the while, and chummering bitterly.</p>
<p>How he did graft! Little, and  skinny, and aged, and ill-fed as he was, he cheerfully faced mountains of  labour, and wore them down by sheer pertinacity&mdash;shifted them by faith and  works. What wonders of toil can one determined man perform in a year! To know  you must see the man struggling amongst the evidences of it, with the work of  his hands piled up about him, and the man&rsquo;s sole master must be a belief, sane  or otherwise.</p>
<p>Humpy&rsquo;s faith in Grim Creek was  transcendent. That the creek gave him no justification mattered not a scrap. He  lived in a little bark hut, comfortless as a mia-mia, on nothing in particular;  he dressed at work in a worn shirt, patched extravagantly, and deplorable  trousers and boots, and he wound lengths of sugee about his shins. His hat, a  battered boxer, a gift from a sympathetic selector, had a big hole fore and  aft&mdash;driven to extremes, he had once run a handle through it, and used it for a  ladle when cradling&mdash;and the whole costume was cemented and frescoed with the  grit and clay of the unspeakable creek.</p>
<p>The old man never had a mate&mdash;he  never wanted one. He designed all sorts of hare-brained, unworkable  contrivances in the shape of dumb-waiters, and cranks, and feed-pipes, and  sluices, to overcome the difficulties that hamper a lone hand, but through  disappointments and dangers and endless tribulation he struggled on, and turned  up regularly every Saturday afternoon at the log store on the Piper road with  his pathetic little packet of gold and his long familiar story of the good day  that was coming for Grim Creek and the surrounding district when he finally  &ldquo;got on to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few of the farmers and  selectors in the district, thinking that possibly, by reason of an unlooked-for  contingency, Humpy might some day &ldquo;get on to it&rdquo; and boom the place a bit,  helped with gifts of food and old clothes that to him were as good as new. One  or two, from pure wooden-headed good nature, visited him at times, especially  on Sundays, and sat with him in the sun or in his smoky hut, and let him talk  to them by the hour about his creek. Next to grafting in the creek like a  tiger, nothing pleased Humpy better than to prattle about his work, and invent,  and lie, and rhapsodize to a sympathetic audience.</p>
<p>Tom Hughes was the old digger&rsquo;s  best friend. He had secured a selection in the locality of Grim Creek within  the last six months, built a hut upon it, and settled down to take life as  easily as a selector can who observes the covenants. Hughes was a hatter&mdash;a big,  hairy man, physically slow, mentally alert, with a golden faculty of extracting  amusement out of anything and everything, from the capers of his waddling  terrier pup or the solicitude of a motherly hen to the foibles of his fellows.  Hughes enjoyed Humpy Bannon enormously. He cultivated him. He would sit and  study him by the hour, ponderous and apparently as grave as a fat frog between  meals, but with a soul full of laughter. Humpy reminded him of an ant that he  had once seen attempt to shift Mount   Macedon. The ant thought  the mount obstructed its view, or felt that it had a call; anyhow, Tom kept  track of the insect for a week and neglected his duties to watch progress, and  when he left the ant was still going strongly. Now, here was this other midge  ripping up the face of nature and tearing at the bowels of the earth after  something he didn&rsquo;t really want and wouldn&rsquo;t know how to appreciate. Wifeless,  childless, without a taste superior to mutton and bread or an aspiration above  the puddling tub, and with very few years of life before him, he worked from  daylight to dusk, moving mountains, and grew radiant describing the treasure he  must win some day. Yet ten shillings a week would have satisfied his needs,  twelve would have embarrassed him with riches.</p>
<p>Walking along the creek one day  Hughes came upon the old man clambering out of a prospecting hole on a rise. He  was dripping wet, and coated with mud; clay was in his hair and his ears, and the  dirty water ran from him as he stood. Humpy was too busy for conversation; he  seized the windlass handle and began hauling with terrific energy. There were  two buckets on the rope&mdash;one a kerosene tin, the other an ordinary water bucket.  Humpy landed and emptied these, and then, lowering the rope into the shaft  again, began to fish about. Presently he hooked another bucket and brought it  to the surface. After fishing once more he landed a nail keg. Then he proceeded  to let himself down again, sliding on the rope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the little game, old  man?&rdquo; asked Hughes as the dripping head disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a bit o&rsquo; wash here.  Tremenjis rich, I think,&rdquo; answered Bannon up the shaft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too wet; you&rsquo;ll never  be able to bottom, workin&rsquo; her alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet I will, though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further comment was deferred by  the pit-pit of the old man&rsquo;s pick in the wet hole. Tom Hughes hooked the nail  keg, and put in an hour or so at the windlass, and was rewarded later with  Humpy&rsquo;s confidence. As usual, the little man was on the eve of a discovery that  was going to revolutionize the district, and bring a big town humming about  their ears on Grim Creek in less than no time. Hughes was a better miner than  old Bannon, and thought the latter was fighting after a vain thing, but he  offered no advice, understanding that it would be wasted, and remembering that  it was Humpy&rsquo;s policy to go and find out for himself at whatever cost of sweat  and patience.</p>
<p>Humpy did bottom that hole, and  scraped up a prospect that promised about ten &ldquo;weights &rdquo; to the load to a  sanguine man, but the water was up within three feet of the surface next  morning, and eight hours&rsquo; vigorous baling had no appreciable effect. The claim  could not be worked without a diving-suit and apparatus.</p>
<p>So Humpy went apart and thought. He  wasted little time in speculation, and presently took a bee-line from his shaft  to the foot of the rise, 250 yards off, and commenced an open cutting. His idea  was to carry this narrow cutting into the hill on a level as long as he could  throw the dirt, and then, when the sides became too high, to tunnel to the  shaft, and so drain the ground he wished to work. This represented about a  year&rsquo;s labour to an average man working decent hours and in moderation. It was  an utterly fatuous and foolhardy undertaking; as far as it was possible to  judge, the ground would not pay for the working, let alone compensate for this  gigantic &ldquo;dead horse;&rdquo; but Bannon did not calculate&mdash;he worked. On the occasion  of Hughes&rsquo;s next visit he found Humpy pegging away industriously in his  cutting. He had covered a good distance in the shallow ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old party, what&rsquo;re you  coursin&rsquo; after now?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>Humpy explained between blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee-rusalem, but you do lick  &rsquo;ell an&rsquo; all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom proceeded to explain the  difficulties of the job, and the ridiculousness of it; but the digger&rsquo;s under-hand pick was  going busily all the time, and at last Hughes seated himself upon a log and  overlooked the toiler in silent enjoyment of his wonderful courage, his  dunderheadedness, and the comical little ape-like figure and quaint tricks and  turns of the man.</p>
<p>Humpy persisted, and in the weeks  wore by his cutting extended and deepened, and at length he was forced to take  on another contract. It was necessary to get the water away. He felled trees,  and split palings, and laid down a box drain all along the cutting&mdash;a wonderful  drain, representing much time and trouble. He timbered his job where timber was  needed, and continued as before eating his way into the hill, and as he  progressed his pride in his work increased. The cutting was trim and true;  Humpy bestowed the most loving care upon it, and Tom Hughes brought all the  strangers he came across to inspect and admire it as the one spectacle of Grim  Creek, and to gaze upon Humpy and wonder over him. And whilst Tom stood aloft  eulogizing the digger with something of the air of a showman, and amiably  explaining his humours and eccentricities for the pleasure of these strangers,  Humpy hammered away eagerly on the job below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t got common-sense about minin&rsquo;,&rdquo;  Hughes would say; &ldquo;have you, old man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Humpy, with his pick driven to  the eye in the wall before him, would turn up his puckered, tanned, hairy face  with the aspect of a venerable mandril, and damn his friend&mdash;hide, bones, and  soul&mdash;as the selector went on:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But in a tunnel or a drive he&rsquo;d  work any man I ever knew stone-blind inside a week. Wouldn&rsquo;t you, Humpy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>More profanity from below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, he&rsquo;s built for it. Them  shoulders was built fer pokin&rsquo; round in low black drives an&rsquo; muddy tunnels, but  he&rsquo;s wasted fer want of horse sense. He&rsquo;s a blessed steam-engine whirling away  like blazes, but doin&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; that matters a hang. Look at him! He&rsquo;s the only  man in Australia that likes work&mdash;he&rsquo;d rather be workin&rsquo; than drinkin&rsquo;&mdash;an&rsquo; he&rsquo;s  only happy when he&rsquo;s clayed up to the ears and sweatin&rsquo; quarts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes a visitor dropped Humpy  a half-crown or a shilling, and often a settler or farmer gave him help; but  for all that he was compelled to leave his cutting now and again and go  fossicking in the creek for a pennyweight or two, and then he was given over to  a great discontent. Whilst he was working in the cutting it preserved its  spick-and-span appearance; when he was away dead leaves accumulated in it, and  Monaghan&rsquo;s sheep sometimes destroyed the symmetry of its edges, and that  affected Humpy as dirt and litter about a room irritate a good housewife.</p>
<p>But as time passed the great work  progressed, and at length the tunnel had been opened out, and was being driven  towards the shaft. It was the most elegant of tunnels, with a beautiful  entrance, and carefully squared throughout, and it went in and in until at  length, when Humpy was within a week of his goal, there came jangling up the  creek one day a mounted policeman. The officer of the law examined Bannon&rsquo;s hut  carefully, and tossed things about and turned the place upside down with the  placid insolence with which power endows most men; and then he rode to Humpy&rsquo;s  cutting, called the little man into the light of day, handcuffed him, and led  him off.</p>
<p>The charge was sheep-stealing.  There was no doubt of Bannon&rsquo;s guilt: one skin with the brand on it was found  doing service as a rug on his bunk another, quite fresh, was tacked up in his  shed; and the best part of a fine lamb was rescued from his pickling-tub, and  produced in court. The spirit of the early squatter still survives in the  particular and express abomination of sheep-stealing manifested by our virtuous  and humane judges. The sentence was two years.</p>
<p>Tom Hughes tried hard to preserve  Humpy&rsquo;s cutting from destruction, and kept a careful eye on his hut, but,  walking down the creek one day twenty months later, he came upon the little old  digger standing surveying the ruins of his great work. The sides of the cutting  had tumbled in, the tunnel was down, and the drained ground was worked out.  Humpy was smaller-looking and more shrunken, and ten years seemed to have been  added to his age; he was bent nearly double, and was bleached a deadly  dough-colour; his limbs trembled as he stood, and he snivelled miserably like a  boy. No greeting passed between the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas three fellers from Melbourne done it,&rdquo; said  Hughes, indicating the cuttings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn &rsquo;em!&rdquo; snapped Bannon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tried hard to stop &rsquo;em,&rdquo;  continued the selector. &ldquo;I explained it was your job; I argued, an&rsquo; pleaded,  an&rsquo; preached, but &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t no good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tom had also fought the  intruders, singly and in a bunch, and had been severely manhandled for his  kindness and consideration, but he did not explain this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hows&rsquo;mever, Wasn&rsquo;t worth a  cuss,&rdquo; he added eagerly. &ldquo;They skursly knocked out tucker, an&rsquo; only hung on  jest from pure villainy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a lie: the young men had  done fairly well out of Humpy&rsquo;s claim, and had taken to town with them when  they left sufficient gold to run a month-long &ldquo;bender&rdquo; of the most virulent and  dazzling description.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn &rsquo;em!&rdquo; said Humpy again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better track up to yer hut, old  man,&rdquo; Hughes said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find it in order. You can spell-oh till you pick up  a bit, an&rsquo; then you can get down to graft. You&rsquo;ll be all right, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; grasped Bannon with a  feeble return of his old fire, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; above the fork I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;  after. I&rsquo;ll have to turn the creek. B&rsquo;lieve there&rsquo;s some ten-ounce stuff  there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hughes had to lead him to his  hut, and attend to him for a few days, but presently Humpy was out and about  again, with pick and shovel, pottering weakly here and there. Once Tom found  him struggling to clean out the old cutting. By-and-by he started making great  raids upon the hills, digging aimless holes, and throwing up heaps of dirt  anywhere. Two or three times he was discovered lying helplessly by his work. At  length the same policeman came trotting up the gully again, and once more Humpy  Bannon was led away. This time he did not come back. He finished his days  performing extraordinary feats of labour with a little wooden shovel at Yarra  Bend Lunatic Asylum, destroyed in mind and body by eighteen months of  comparative peace and rest and comfort in Her Majesty&rsquo;s gaol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheElopementofMrsPeters"></a>The Elopement of Mrs. Peters</h2>
<p>Simon Peters,  irreverently called &ldquo;The Apostle,&rdquo; returned to the railway camp late on Sunday  night, and found his tent topsy-turvy and his &ldquo;missus &rdquo; gone. On the paling  table, weighted with a piece of cheese, was a scrap of sugar-paper, on which  was written in Fan&rsquo;s dog-leg hand:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sik. I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to cleer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim swore a muffled oath under  his abundant moustache, and looked around upon the unwonted disorder. The blue  blanket and the rug had been stripped from their bunk; the spare, rough  furniture of the big tent lay about in confusion; and amongst the grey ashes in  the wide sod fireplace was a bunch of reddish hair. Peters fished this out, and  examined it with as much astonishment as the phlegmatic, even-tempered navvy  was capable of feeling. It was his wife&rsquo;s hair, and had evidently been hacked  off in a hurry, regardless of effect. Piled on the bush stool against the wall  were Mrs. Peters&rsquo;s clothes. Nothing of hers that Peters could recall was  missing; even the big quondong ear-rings, of which she was so proud, were  thrown upon the floor. Her hat was on the bed, and her boots were under the  table.</p>
<p>Still clutching the mop of hair  in his hand, Sim backed solemnly and soberly on to a seat, and sat for a few  minutes gravely weighing the evidence. Obviously Fanny had gone off clad only  in a blue blanket or a &rsquo;possum rug. This was most extraordinary, even for  Fanny, but there was some satisfaction in it, since it should not be difficult  to trace a white woman so attired.</p>
<p>Presently Peters arose and went  forth to prosecute inquiries. On Saturday, before departing for Dunolly, he had  asked Rolley&rsquo;s wife to keep an eye on the missus. As he approached the gaffer&rsquo;s  tent, however, he heard a woman&rsquo;s voice raised in shrill vituperation, and  recognised Mrs. Rolley&rsquo;s strident contralto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor mother that&rsquo;s in heaven  knew you, you&mdash;&mdash;. She always said you was a&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And poor Rolley was inundated  with a torrent of his own choice blasphemies. Simon Peters knew by experience  that when Mrs. Rolley dragged her sainted mother into little domestic  differences, she was at least two days gone in drink, and quite incapable of  recollecting anything beyond Rolley&rsquo;s shortcomings, so he turned away with a  sigh, and carried his quest into the camp. Half an hour later he returned to  his tent and resumed his thoughtful attitude on the stool. He had secured one  piece of evidence that seemed to throw a good deal of light on the situation.  Late on Saturday night someone had broken into Curly Hunter&rsquo;s tent and stolen  therefrom a grey tweed suit, a black felt hat, and a pair of light blucher  boots. Peters, putting this and that together slowly and with great mental  effort, concluded that Curly Hunter and Fanny were about the same height. He  recollected, too, the explanation his wife offered when he discovered her back  to be seamed and lined with scars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dad done it,&rdquo; said Fanny. &ldquo;Poor  old dad, he was always lickin&rsquo; me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; gasped Peters, filled with  a sudden itch to beat the throat of his deceased father-in-law, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t mean  to say the cowardly brute lashed you like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; replied she,  laughing lightly. &ldquo;He used to rope me up to the cow-bail an&rsquo; hammer me with a  horsewhip. Once when I set the grass on fire, an&rsquo; burned the stable an&rsquo; the  dairy; another time when I broke Grasshopper&rsquo;s neck, ridin&rsquo; him over Coleman&rsquo;s  chock-an&rsquo;-log fence; an&rsquo; agen when I dressed up in Tom&rsquo;s clothes, took a swag,  and got a job pickin&rsquo;-up in M&lsquo;Kinley&rsquo;s shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Early on Monday morning Peters  had an interview with Curly Hunter. Hunter was sympathetic, and readily sold  Sim the stolen things at a modest valuation, promising at the same time to  observe a friendly reticence in the matter; but, for all that, two hours later  everybody in the camp knew that Mrs. Peters had run off, and that &ldquo;The Apostle&rdquo;  was away hunting for her. The general opinion, freely and profanely expressed,  was that Simon Peters was a superlative idiot. It was agreed that Peters would  have exhibited common-sense by sitting still under the bereavement, and  casually thanking Providence  for the &ldquo;let off.&rdquo; Since Mrs. Peters started a couple of ramshackle waggons  down the gradient, and nearly smashed up Ryan&rsquo;s gang, the camp had suddenly  grown weary of her &ldquo;monkey tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Simon Peters was a woman of  twenty-six, ten or twelve years younger than her husband, more comely, more  decent, and more presentable in every way than the other wives of the camp. She  did not get drunk in the bedroom end of Wingy Lee&rsquo;s shanty on pay nights, did  not use the picturesque idiom of the gangers in ordinary conversation, and in  some respects had been a good mate to Peters. But it must be admitted that the  camp had further justification in doubting the complete sanity of Simon  Peters&rsquo;s wife. She had an eerie expression that was quaintly accented by keen,  twinkling, black eyes in combination with light red hair and rather pale brows;  and she was possessed of a spirit of mischief that led her into the wildest  extravagances. Her devilment was that of an ungovernable school-boy, without  his preposterous sense of humour. An uncontrollable yearning for excitement  impelled her to the strangest actions. She had another peculiar characteristic,  not unknown to the camp, in her apparent insensibility to physical pain. Peters  had been astounded by the fact that a burn, a cut, a scald, or a blow provoked  no complainings from his wife and scarcely any regard. This indifference  extended to the sufferings of others. After the blasting accident in the North  cutting, Fanny, of all the women in the camp, was the only one who had the  nerve to approach the mangled body of poor M&lsquo;Intyre, and she placidly worked  over the shocking mass, still instinct with life, when the strongest men turned  sick at the sight of it.</p>
<p>Sim made no effort to understand  his wife, which was well, as he was only an average man, and she was past finding  out. He concluded that her extraordinary conduct was just the natural  unreasonableness and contrariness of women &ldquo;coming out strong,&rdquo; and made the  best of the situation in which he found himself. Being an average man, Sim was  a superior navvy; he only got drunk on big occasions, and, drunk or sober,  treated his wife with indulgent fondness, and occasionally Fanny seemed fond of  him in return; but then she had been very warmly attached to that father who  used to bail her up in the cowshed and lash her with a horsewhip in the hope of  converting her to sweet reasonableness.</p>
<p>On the Monday morning Peters  first went up the road, seeking his wife, but no one at White&rsquo;s had seen a slim  young fellow in a grey suit pass that way, so he tried down the road, with better  success. Clark, at the Travellers&rsquo; Rest, had  seen &ldquo;just sich a feller&rdquo; as Sim described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had a drink here Sunday,  an&rsquo; left, making for Moliagul, it seemed t&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said Clark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They?&rdquo; queried Peters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There was two of &rsquo;em. The  big feller shouted. A brown-faced chap, with a black moustache, an&rsquo; a deep cut  in his chin, here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simon&rsquo;s grip made a dent in the  pewter he held, and a grey hue crept over his cheeks and into his lips. Never  before had he doubted his wife in this way; never through all her mad escapades  had he had reason to question her fealty as a wife till now. Peters remembered  the man distinctly; he had seen him about the camp, looking for work. The  peculiar cleft chin would serve to identify him amongst ten thousand. Striding  along the road the fugitives had taken, the navvy recollected hearing Fanny  speaking enthusiastically of the tall, brown stranger as a fine man, and the  grey in his cheek deepened to the colour of ashes, and his jaw hardened  meaningly. His quest had suddenly assumed a terrible significance, and that  fierce pallor and grim rigidity of the jaw never left him until its end.</p>
<p>Peters heard of them again in the  afternoon, but got off the trail towards evening, and it was not till late on  the following day that he picked up the scent. Then he talked with a farmer who  had seen them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They slep&rsquo; in an old hut up in  my grass paddock las&rsquo; night,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;an&rsquo; went up the road at about  seven this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did both men sleep in the hut?&rdquo;  asked Peters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sim continued his journey,  steadily, and with apparent unconcern, but cherishing an immovable  determination to kill the brown-faced man the moment they met.</p>
<p>Early on the Wednesday morning  Peters came up with the runaway. An old man watering a horse at a small creek  told him, in answer to his inquiries:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A tall chap, with a divided  chin&mdash;name of Sandler, ain&rsquo;t it? He&rsquo;s here. I let him a bit of ringin&rsquo;. That&rsquo;s  his axe you hear up the paddock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following the ring of the axe,  Peters soon came upon his man. Sandler stopped working as he approached, and  turned towards him, resting on the handle of his axe. Sim walked to within a  couple of yards of the stranger, and threw off the light swag he carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You infernal hound!&rdquo; he said;  &ldquo;where is my wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sandler started up in extreme  amazement. &ldquo;Keep off!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What the devil do I know about your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peters rushed at him with the  fury of a brute, and the two men exchanged heavy blows. Then they closed, and  wrestled for a moment, but Simon&rsquo;s rage lent him a strength that was  irresistible, and presently the other man was sent down with stunning force. As  he attempted to rise, shaken and almost breathless, Peters, who had seized the  axe, struck him once with the head of it, and Sandler fell back again and lay  perfectly still, with a long, gaping wound over his left eye, from which the  blood poured through his hair upon the new chips and the yellow grass. When  Peters looked up his wife stood facing him. She wore blucher boots, a pair of  grey trousers, and a man&rsquo;s shirt, and carried an axe. She gazed composedly at  the fallen man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done, Sim? &rdquo; she  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ran away with that man?&rdquo; He  pointed at Sandler.</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did not know I was a woman,&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="DeadMansLode"></a>Dead Man&rsquo;s Lode</h2>
<p>It was&nbsp;bright and  cosy within the pile-getters&rsquo; hut; outside the night was wet and stormy, and  the wind piped a deep, mournful organ tone in the gnarled and stunted gums on  the hill-side. The three young men had finished tea, and washed up and squared  up&mdash;that is to say, Dayton had stowed the bread and butter and the remains of  the salt beef in the kerosene box that served them as a larder, M&lsquo;Gill had  dipped the tin plates in hot water and wiped them carefully on a superannuated  white shirt, and Woodhead had raised a tremendous dust under a pretence of  sweeping out the hut with a broom extemporized from a bundle of scrub ferns;  for it was the first principle of their association that every man should &ldquo;do  his whack&rdquo; in the matter of attendance to domestic duties.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too thunderin&rsquo; wet to go down to  the camp, an&rsquo; too blessed windy to climb up to Scrubby&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dayton, who was curing  himself of an extraordinary habit of profanity for a wager, and found the task  of filling in the blanks rather a trial. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose cut-throat&rsquo;s our little  dart,&rdquo; he continued, producing an overworked euchre pack.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill was fighting his way into  a stubborn oil-skin coat that crackled like tin armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not cut-throat to-night, boys,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up the gully a spell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where bound, Mack?&rdquo; queried Dayton, with quick  suspicion. The young men had discovered a pretty girl at Scrubby Scanlan&rsquo;s  settlement, two miles off, and each thought he had an exclusive right to the  friendship and hospitality of Scanlan and the smiles of his handsome,  hard-working, and very sensible eldest daughter.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I  promised &lsquo;The Identity&rsquo; I&rsquo;d give him a look in to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you ought!&rdquo; with great  derision. &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye want foolin&rsquo; after that evil old beast? If he was well  to-morrer he&rsquo;d bang you on the head for half a quid. That&rsquo;s my straight say-so.  I&rsquo;ll be sworn he shook our crosscut; an&rsquo; here you are, dancin&rsquo; attendance same  &rsquo;s if he was clear white!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor devil is as harmless as  a baby,&rdquo; said M&rsquo;Gill. &ldquo;Anyhow, I can&rsquo;t leave a sick man to take his chances in  that miserable hole up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe M&lsquo;Gill went out amidst a rush  of wind and rain, and left his mates to their game and the comfort of their  warm, watertight hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off his bloomin&rsquo; chump!&rdquo;  commented Dayton  emphatically, slapping down the cards.</p>
<p>The philosophical Woodhead, who  was smoking placidly, looked up and cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s all rioht,&rdquo; he drawled.  &ldquo;Always had a weakness for sick things. I&rsquo;ve seen him take more trouble with a  lame dog than most men would over a poor relation. Besides, the old man is real  bad, and if Mack didn&rsquo;t give an eye to him I expect I would have to do it  myself. I&rsquo;m awfully soft-hearted that way, and I like to see other fellows  looking after the poor and the sick&mdash;it saves me the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile M&lsquo;Gill was boring his  way through the storm towards a point of light showing fitfully amongst the  thick, supple saplings that rolled like a sea in a gale. &ldquo;The Identity&rsquo;s&rdquo; hut  stood at the head of the gully, in the centre of a small clearing. It was  sheltered on one side by the abrupt rise of Emu Hill, and exposed on the other  (saving for the intervention of the leafy young peppermints, the growth of  recent years) to the fierce winds that seemed to gather the rains into the  narrow confines of the gully, and drive them pounding up its whole length, in  eddying torrents, to be thrown back in tumbling yellow floods from the  invulnerable side of Emu Hill. Peter Shaw, variously known as &ldquo;The Identity,&rdquo;  &ldquo;The Hermit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blue Peter,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Old Shaw,&rdquo; was a veteran fossicker, a  reticent, gruff man, whose almost complete isolation had recently been broken  by the appearance in the locality of Brown&rsquo;s Patch of a few parties of  sleeper-cutters and pile-getters, driven thitherward by the approach of the  railway to Bunyip. Peter was living in the same chock-and-log hut at the head  of Grasshopper Gully when the first selector settled in the district, and when  the reputation of Brown&rsquo;s Patch as an alluvial field had already faded and been  forgotten, and when the fact that the creek, and the hill, and the gully had  once rattled and rung with the clatter of cradle and puddling-tub, pick and  shovel, and windlass-barrel was unknown to all within the jurisdiction of the  Bunyip Shire Council, with the exception of old Shaw. Even now Peter&rsquo;s settled  neighbours were few and far between, and until the arrival of the  timber-getters his beloved seclusion was but rarely disturbed by man, woman, or  child. He lived, according to the common belief, on the vegetables he grew,  eked out with the supplies he brought from Bunyip at long intervals&mdash;supplies  bought with the price of the few &ldquo;weights &rdquo; of gold won by fossicking patiently  and laboriously up and down the creek and in the many little blind gullies  running into Emu Hill.</p>
<p>Of course &ldquo;The Identity&rdquo; was talked  about. Whenever two or more selectors were met together Peter&rsquo;s character and  habits were sure, sooner or later, to come under discussion, and as he was one  of the the stock themes of the local fabulist, the history attached to him did  not lack romantic interest. He was generally credited with having stolen  everything that went missing in the district, and, amongst the women at least,  there was a profound belief that he and &ldquo;the old devil&rdquo; were on excellent terms  and exchanged visits frequently; but for all the attention Shaw gave these  people they might have been merely stumps or stones by the way.</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill pulled the catch of the  old man&rsquo;s door, and entered without knocking. The remains of a big log were  smouldering in the wide sod chimney, and a slush lamp, manufactured from a  sardine tin, guttered on the bush table, filling the hut with a villainous  smoke. On a narrow bunk, face downward, lay the half-clad figure of a man. &ldquo;The  Identity&rdquo; lifted himself upon his hands as the door clanged to, and turned a  haggard face, surrounded by a scrub of iron-grey hair, towards the intruder.  His eyes brightened as he recognized Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good on you! Good on you!&rdquo; he  gasped, extending a shaky hand. &ldquo;I was hopin&rsquo; you&rsquo;d come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe threw open his oilskin, and  drew a couple of small parcels from his shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, old party,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you some stuff for beef tea, and a bottle of medicine.&rdquo;  Shaw took the bottle in his hand and examined it. It contained a patent  medicine then very popular with bushmen as an infallible remedy for all the  physical ills that man is heir to, from cuts to consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late, my boy,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a done man; but a dose might ease me a bit if it&rsquo;s hot enough&mdash;gimme a  dose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe poured out a quantity of the  medicine into a pannikin, and held it towards him; but the sick man clutched  his hand, and a sudden excitement lit up his deathly face as he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you do the other thing what  I told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your pegs in an&rsquo; make your  application fer the lease all correct an&rsquo; accordin&rsquo; to law?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, just as you told me.  Now drink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shaw drained off his medicine,  but retained his grip on Joe&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain you didn&rsquo;t let on to no  one?&rdquo; he asked, with a look half suspicious, half cunning in his eyes&mdash;&ldquo;no p&rsquo;lice,  no doctors&mdash;eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul; I always keep my  word. But for all that I think you should have a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; cried the old man,  with fierce energy; &ldquo;no doctors&mdash;no p&rsquo;lice! I&rsquo;m peggin&rsquo; out&mdash;don&rsquo;t I know it?&mdash;an&rsquo;  I won&rsquo;t have doctors, damn em! Can&rsquo;t you let a man die his own way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; said Joe,  soothingly; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll buck up again, though, when you get outside a pint or two  of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill threw the wood in the  fireplace together, and set about preparing the beef tea, and Shaw, who had  relapsed into his former position, face downwards upon the bunk, watched every  movement with one alert eye. Presently he spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d tell you the whole  yarn t&rsquo;-night, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, Peter, you&rsquo;re not  equal to it&mdash;wait till you are stronger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stronger! stronger!&rdquo; The  fossicker had started up again, and was glaring angrily. &ldquo;Wait till I&rsquo;m dead  an&rsquo; dumb, you mean. No, it mus&rsquo; be t&rsquo;-night. One of the chaps up at the camp&rsquo;ll  be knockin&rsquo; together a coffin fer me t&rsquo;-morrer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill admitted to himself, as he  looked into the brilliant, deep-set eyes of the man, and saw the grisly  configuration of the skull standing out under the stark yellow skin of his  face, that nothing was more probable. Shaw looked like a man face to face with  death, sustained only by the feverish excitement that blazed in his restless  eyes and manifested itself in the uneasy motions of his wasted hands. The young  man offered him a pannikin of the beef tea, but Peter put it aside after trying  a couple of mouthfuls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t take it, boy,&rdquo; he  said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t take nothin&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t want nothin&rsquo;, only to tell you all before  I cave in. Sit here on the edge of the bunk. I&rsquo;ll hold you so you can&rsquo;t go till  I&rsquo;m through. Wait&mdash;go round the hut, see no one&rsquo;s listenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill, to please him, did as he  was directed, and then resumed his position by the side of the bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; said &ldquo;The Identity,&rdquo; &ldquo;you  come here to help me, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve took a lot of trouble with me, &rsquo;cause you&rsquo;re a  good sort, an&rsquo; can&rsquo;t help it, like; but you don&rsquo;t like me. I could see you  didn&rsquo;t like me&mdash;you suspicioned me from the first, eh&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was quite true, but the  young man returned no answer. There had never been anything about Peter Shaw to  invite affection; in health he was sullen, covert, and uncanny, and in sickness  evil-tempered and childish in his wants, and, more particularly, in his fears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it&mdash;I knew it!&rdquo; he  continued, &ldquo;but because you are a good sort, an&rsquo; because I must out with this  load here, here!&rdquo;&mdash;he struck his breast feebly with his hand&mdash;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo;to tell  you somethin&rsquo; that&rsquo;ll make a rich man of you, Joseph M&lsquo;Gill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clutching Joe&rsquo;s sleeve with his  bony fingers, he went on with his story, speaking in quick undertones, with a  sort of insane energy that sustained him to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to this district twenty  odd years ago, my lad. Brown had just struck the surfacin&rsquo; down the gully by  the creek, an&rsquo; we called the rush Brown&rsquo;s Patch. Two days after campin&rsquo; I  picked up my mate Harry Foote&mdash;Stumpy Foote we named him &rsquo;cause he was bumble-footed.  He was a dog, a mean hound, but he didn&rsquo;t look it, an&rsquo; he was a good miner. We  went to work on the alluvial, an&rsquo; did fairly, but we both had a great idea  about a good reef in these hills. All the indications pointed to it, an&rsquo;  presently we slung the wash an&rsquo; started prospectin&rsquo;. We trenched, an&rsquo;  travelled, an&rsquo; trenched fer weeks without strikin&rsquo; an ounce of quartz, an&rsquo;  Stumpy got full of it; but I grew more certain about that lode, an&rsquo; hung on. So  we agreed that he&rsquo;d go back to the alluvial again, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d keep on peggin&rsquo;away  after the reef, an&rsquo; we&rsquo;d be mates whatever turned up. Well, we kep&rsquo; this up fer  a long time, me trustin&rsquo; Stumpy all the time, an&rsquo; intendin&rsquo; t&rsquo; do the square  thing by him when I lobbed on the lode, as I was sure I would. I worked like a  fiend. I was mad fer gold then. I hadn&rsquo;t been out on&rsquo;y a few years, an&rsquo;  strikin&rsquo; it lucky meant everythin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me; meant&mdash;But no matter, that ain&rsquo;t  anythin&rsquo; t&rsquo; do with the story. You wouldn&rsquo;t understand how I felt if I told  you, an&rsquo; I believe I don&rsquo;t understand meself now. Stumpy did poorly, or told me  as much. I got barely enough as my share to pay tucker bills, but he kep&rsquo;  workin&rsquo; away, sluicin&rsquo; the surfacin&rsquo; down along the creek&mdash;a patch he had hit on  himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One night I returned to the tent  unexpected. Foote had told me the week afore that he was goin&rsquo; to roll up his  swag. an&rsquo; skip, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;d bin out on those hills beyond Scanlan&rsquo;s ever since. A  light was burnin&rsquo; inside, an&rsquo; Stumpy didn&rsquo;t hear me till I&rsquo;d thrown back the  flap of the tent. He was leanin&rsquo; over the table, an&rsquo; he looked up at me sudden,  an&rsquo; his face went milky white. Well it might&mdash;I caught him in the act of  sweepin&rsquo; a pile of gold into a canvas bag. A pile&mdash;a heap&mdash;hundreds of ounces it  looked t&rsquo; me&mdash;hundreds of ounces in coarse nuggets an&rsquo; rich specimens. The cur  fumbled it in his hurry t&rsquo; get it out of sight, an&rsquo; spilled some of the finer  stuff on the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went mad at the sight of all  that gold, an&rsquo; at the thought of the dirty trick he&rsquo;d served me. I didn&rsquo;t  speak, but jes&rsquo; grabbed him so, by the neck, an&rsquo; dragged him outer the tent. I  don&rsquo;t think I meant murder&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know what I meant, but there was a pick  handle leanin&rsquo; agen the sod chimbley, an&rsquo; I took it in my right hand. He opened  his mouth to yell, an&rsquo; I hit him once&mdash;jes&rsquo; once&mdash;an&rsquo; he went over like a wet  shirt. I waited fer him to get up, but he didn&rsquo;t move agen, an&rsquo; when I come t&rsquo;  look at him he was dead. The paper-skulled, chicken-hearted cur, he was dead!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t funk&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t lose my  head fer a second. I was never cooler in my life; my brain was clear, but I saw  on&rsquo;y one thing at a time&mdash;on&rsquo;y one thing, an&rsquo; I acted on it. After dousin&rsquo; the  light in the tent, I took Stumpy up on my shoulder, an&rsquo; carried him over the  hill to the slope furthest from the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a clear, moonlight night,  bright enough t&rsquo; read Bible print by, but the sides of Emu Hill was well  timbered, an&rsquo; the saplin&rsquo;s was thick as scrub, so I was not likely t&rsquo; be seen.  I dropped the body in a small clear space amongst a thick patch of scrub on  that spur above the soda spring. There was a good depth of soft vegetable soil  there&mdash;a beautiful quiet place fer a grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I went back t&rsquo; the tent,  careless like, case anyone should chance along; but the camp was a good step  down the creek from our tent, an&rsquo; I never met a soul. Stumpy had his swag ready  fer rollin&rsquo; up&mdash;he meant to cut and leave me. I took up his things an&rsquo; a pick  an&rsquo; shovel, an&rsquo; trudged back t&rsquo; the body. It lay sprawlin&rsquo; in the shadder of  the scrub, jest as I&rsquo;d dropped it, one hand reachin&rsquo; out into the light clawin&rsquo;  the grass; but I on&rsquo;y thought of my job, an&rsquo; I set t&rsquo; work t&rsquo;dig his grave at  once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I worked quietly&mdash;the pick made  no noise in that soft ground&mdash;but I worked hard. I meant t&rsquo; bury him deep, an&rsquo;  bury him well. A neat hole I made him, seven by two, an&rsquo; as plumb as a  prospectin&rsquo; shaft. As I dug an&rsquo; shovelled&mdash;quite cool in my mind, fer all the  body was spread out there behind me in the shadder&mdash;my thoughts went wanderin&rsquo;  over my bad luck, an&rsquo; the idea that Stumpy had been on good gold, an&rsquo; meant to  rob me of my fair half, made me vicious, an&rsquo; I belted in hard an&rsquo; fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had her down &rsquo;bout three foot,  an&rsquo; reckoned that&rsquo;d nearly do. I was squarin&rsquo; up the end when my pick struck  agen somethin&rsquo; that made it ring. I dug away a bit around that somethin&rsquo;, a  sudden excitement growin&rsquo; in me, an&rsquo; makin&rsquo; me ferget I was diggin&rsquo; a grave&mdash;a  grave fer a murdered man. Down in the west corner of the hole I saw the white  gleam of quartz. Stoopin&rsquo;, I lit a match to examine it. By the Lord, Joe! I&rsquo;d  struck it&mdash;struck it thick an&rsquo; rich!&rdquo; Old Peter&rsquo;s agitation became so intense at  this stage that Joe was compelled to put his arms about his attenuated form,  and hold him on the bunk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that fire, boy?&rdquo; he gasped,  pointing an uncertain hand, and glaring as if in a frenzy. &ldquo;Well, it was like  that&mdash;the live embers, the glowin&rsquo; red gold in it! Rich! It seemed all gold. I&rsquo;d  struck the cap of the reef, an&rsquo; I went a&rsquo;most mad with joy at the sight of the  beautiful, beautiful gold. I staggered back agen the other end of the hole, starin&rsquo;  at the reef. I was goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; yell an&rsquo; dance, thinkin&rsquo; of nothin&rsquo; but my lovely  luck, when I half turned, an&rsquo; caught a glimpse of Stumpy&rsquo;s white, dead face  glowerin&rsquo; et me in the moonlight, an&rsquo; I funked fer the first time. The shadder  had crep&rsquo; back, leavin&rsquo; jest his face showin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; there it was, with a spark  in each of its big eyes, mouthin&rsquo; at me&mdash;grinnin&rsquo; horribly!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went dead cold, my legs broke  under me. All of a sudden I was dreadfully afraid. Then I thought: &lsquo;Pete, this  is a hangin&rsquo; match&mdash;Pete, they&rsquo;re after you. What&rsquo;s the good of a golden reef to  a hanged man?&rsquo; I crawled out of the hole, wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; run, but It&rsquo;s devilish  eyes followed me. Oh! I crawled like a worm, crazy with fear&mdash;sick with it! The  findin&rsquo; the gold there in his grave seemed a damned trick of his an&rsquo; the  devil&rsquo;s t&rsquo; spite me&mdash;t&rsquo; make me mad. I seemed t&rsquo; know then, while the horror was  on me, what it all meant&mdash;thet I&rsquo;d cursed meself fer ever&mdash;thet, good luck or bad  luck, fer the future &rsquo;twas all the same t&rsquo; me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was strong enough t&rsquo; bury  him. I turned his face down, an&rsquo; dragged the body along, an&rsquo; flung it into the  hole on top of the reef; and when it was out of sight, under a foot or so of  dirt, I began t&rsquo; feel stronger an&rsquo; braver, an&rsquo; t&rsquo; reason a bit. I would bury  him beautifully there, I said to meself, an&rsquo; wait, an&rsquo; some time I would dig  him up again, and hide him far enough away, an&rsquo; then I could work the reef, an&rsquo;  by-an&rsquo; bye go home to&mdash;to&mdash;go home a rich man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did bury him, an&rsquo; then crawled  back t&rsquo; the tent, an&rsquo; tried t&rsquo; sleep, but couldn&rsquo;t. At daylight I was back at  the grave again, smoothin&rsquo; it with my fingers, rakin&rsquo; dry leaves, an&rsquo; grass,  an&rsquo; bark over it t&rsquo; hide every trace, shiverin&rsquo; in my boots all the time. They  reckoned me a brave man once. I&rsquo;d done some things that made men think me game.  But I&rsquo;ve been a cur ever since the night I killed my mate&mdash;a coward in the night  an&rsquo; in the day, before men and before devils.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durin&rsquo; the day I managed to go  down among the men an&rsquo; make inquiries &rsquo;bout Stumpy. None of the chaps seemed  surprised t&rsquo; hear he was not around, an&rsquo; one or two hinted pretty straight thet  I wasn&rsquo;t likely t&rsquo; see him agen&mdash;thet he&rsquo;d been doin&rsquo; pretty well down the  creek, an&rsquo; had cleared with the gold to do me outer my share.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, I never dared t&rsquo; touch Stumpy&rsquo;s  grave from thet day t&rsquo; this. Fer five years small parties was workin&rsquo; about the  creek off an&rsquo; on, an&rsquo; I kep&rsquo; tellin&rsquo; meself that when they&rsquo;d all gone some day  I&rsquo;d shift Stumpy&rsquo;s bones. Then the Chows came fossickin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; time went on, an&rsquo;  as it passed I grew more an&rsquo; more of a coward. Once or twice there&rsquo;s bin  prospectin&rsquo; parties out here after the reef, an&rsquo; I think I was stark crazy  while they was about. The fear of them strikin&rsquo; the lode used t&rsquo; drive me wild,  an&rsquo; I grew t&rsquo; hate every man who come near Emu Hill, an&rsquo; gradually to loathe  the sight of human bein&rsquo;s. I shifted up here t&rsquo; be further from the grave, an&rsquo;  &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;d got luny notions that Stumpy was walkin&rsquo; about o&rsquo; nights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was on&rsquo;y a hundred ounces  or so in my mate&rsquo;s bag, after all. It&rsquo;d looked five times ez much t&rsquo; me. It&rsquo;s  buried in the ground jest under the head of my bunk. Onst I sold a few ounces  of it in et the township, but it was coarse stuff, an&rsquo; the news got &rsquo;round, an&rsquo;  the next thing I knew there was another small rush along the creek, an&rsquo; diggers  was pokin&rsquo; about everywhere. That frightened me again. If the reef was struck  Stumpy&rsquo;s bones would be found, an&rsquo; they&rsquo;d hang me, sure ez death. Half a dozen  men lived at Wombat who&rsquo;d remember my mate&rsquo;s disappearance, an&rsquo; there was things  I&rsquo;d buried with Stumpy that&rsquo;d make his bones known. So I buried the gold, an&rsquo;  never tried t&rsquo; sell another colour of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since then I&rsquo;ve had scores of  chances of shiftin&rsquo; them bones, but I wasn&rsquo;t the man t&rsquo; do it, an&rsquo; then I begun  t&rsquo; find thet I didn&rsquo;t want to&mdash;thet I didn&rsquo;t want the gold&mdash;thet I didn&rsquo;t want  any of the things thet I&rsquo;d wanted like mad before. But I didn&rsquo;t go away. I was  chained here, an&rsquo; I always thought thet some day someone would find Stumpy, an&rsquo;  I would be wanted, an&rsquo; all these years I&rsquo;ve dreaded it, an&rsquo; waited fer it, an&rsquo;  hated, an&rsquo; suffered, an&rsquo; here I am, an&rsquo; there, out on the hill, are Stumpy&rsquo;s  bones, an&rsquo; the gold&mdash;the beautiful yellow gold! It&rsquo;s yours, Joe&mdash;all yours. I  leave it to you! You know the spot. I planted that stunted bluegum, with the  limb thet turns down to the ground, right on the top of the grave the mornin&rsquo;  after I buried him. You&rsquo;ll find his bones in among its roots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Identity&rdquo; sank back on his  bed, cold and exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll bury them bones decent,  Joe?&rdquo; he murmured in a voice that had suddenly grown faint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Peter,&rdquo; replied M&lsquo;Gill, in  whose mind the story had created both amazement and doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve got the lease, Joe,  sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve applied for it&mdash;the ground  is secured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll stick by me  while I last, eh&mdash;you won&rsquo;t go? An&rsquo; no p&rsquo;lice, mind&mdash;no p&rsquo;lice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was already daylight when Joe  M&lsquo;Gill awakened his mates stumbling into the hut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Shaw is dead,&rdquo; he explained  to the indignant Dayton.  &ldquo;You might dress, Jack, and go and stay by him, for decency&rsquo;s sake, while I  have a few hours&rsquo; sleep. And, Woodhead, you must go to Bunyip and bring the  police. They will have to take charge of the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M&lsquo;Gill and his mates found the  skeleton of Foote exactly as Peter Shaw had said they would, and the grinning  skull rested upon the cap of the golden reef that was eventually known as &ldquo;Dead  Man&rsquo;s Lode,&rdquo; and which, before twelve months went by, had enriched the three  young men, and had yielded small fortunes to many dozens beside.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AVainSacrifice"></a>A Vain Sacrifice</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A&nbsp;big fire&nbsp;down  on the flat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after midnight. Petersen,  Manly, Collier, and Grigg had been playing euchre for the last five hours, and  drinking Cody&rsquo;s hand-made, chain-lightning whisky. They were heavy-eyed and  heavy-headed, and did not seem to realize the significance of the shout for a  few moments. Then they placed their cards carefully on the table, face  downwards, and filed out, blundering along the passage to the hotel verandah.</p>
<p>A fierce red glow burned against  the western sky, and far down amongst the black gum-trees a tongue of flame  danced in the darkness.</p>
<p>Petersen, his tall form steadied  against the verandah post, gazed for a moment, and the heaviness passed out of  his eyes, succeeded by a keen interest, the flush in his handsome bearded face,  induced by the heat of the room and the poisonous liquor he had drunk, died  out, and his cheeks became ashen-grey in the dim light reflected from the bar  window. Suddenly a cry burst from his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my house! Oh, God, my  wife!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang off in the darkness, and  rushed at full speed along the rough track leading down the hill in the  direction of the fire, and his friends followed swiftly on his heels.</p>
<p>Petersen had only become even a  moderately good customer to Cupid Cody, the preternaturally ugly landlord of the <em>Wallaby  Arms</em>, and patentee and sole proprietor of the Gehenna brand of whisky,  within the last three months; but of late he had been a very frequent visitor  at the hotel, and had developed an appetite for Cupid&rsquo;s noxious liquors and a  fondness for euchre which Mr. Cody was not slow to encourage.</p>
<p>Bert was a native of the Pea  Creek district, and after living a sober and industrious life to take suddenly  to vitriolic whisky and combative euchre parties two years after marriage was  to excite curiosity and comment. The comment was not complimentary to Mrs.  Bert. His few scattered neighbours seemed to find a sneaking satisfaction in  the belief that Petersen was not happy in his married life. This, they  contended, was only in accord with the fitness of things. In the first place  young Petersen had gone to town for his wife, an action that was considered  extremely unneighbourly, and was accepted as a reflection upon the marriageable  young maidens of Pea Creek and district. In the second place Mrs. Petersen had  shown no disposition to &ldquo;make up to&rdquo; her neighbours&rsquo; wives and daughters, and  consequently had the reputation of being &ldquo;stuck up,&rdquo; and that is a sin  unpardonable amongst bush people, to whom sociability means so much.</p>
<p>Bert&rsquo;s married life had not been  the happiest. The girl he loved and the girl he married was quite unsuited to  the life his wife was called upon to lead. She was a small, fair, town-bred  girl, fond of gaiety and admiration, and used to little work and much  amusement. He had won her in his best clothes, in the course of occasional  trips to the city, and he took her to his home out in the silent bush, where  the nearest neighbour was a quarter of a mile off, and then a big, plain,  motherly person, with a great contempt for &ldquo;Sunday clothes,&rdquo; and few ideas  above the dairy.</p>
<p>Lately Mary&rsquo;s discontent had  shown itself in petulant outbursts, in fits of the sulks, and a callous  indifference to her husband&rsquo;s feelings, She grew to despise Petersen in his  coloured moleskins and heavy boots. Bert fought against it good-humouredly,  striving to make her life pleasant, and to retain her affection, but latterly  her temper had driven him almost to despair, and as he still loved her he  preferred the savage delights of Cody&rsquo;s bar parlour to the childish  querulousness of the disappointed woman and her eternal twitching at his  heartstrings.</p>
<p>Petersen&rsquo;s house was quite two  miles from the <em>Wallaby Arms</em>, and throughout the long race the fear  that had sprung into the man&rsquo;s soul never left him for a second. A conviction  that his wife was in the burning house possessed him, and endowed him with  extraordinary speed and strength.</p>
<p>He had left his wife at five  o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, suffering from the headache that seemed to have  become perpetual, and that filled his house with wailing, and called down upon  his head tearful reproaches without reason and without end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; he had asked,  helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you can go away,&rdquo; she  answered, with fierce petulance.</p>
<p>When Petersen reached his burning  home two or three men were running about hopelessly with buckets of water, and  two pale-faced women stood before the house, watching it burn, stupid with  fear. To these Bert appealed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife! where is she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The women shook their heads  dumbly, and one pointed a long, trembling hand towards the leaping flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no!&rdquo; the husband cried,  and he called his wife&rsquo;s name again and again, running wildly from place to  place. The men had seen nothing of Mrs. Petersen&mdash;they believed she was in the  house.</p>
<p>Distracted with fear and grief,  Bert rushed once round the home, seeking amongst the saplings, crying his  wife&rsquo;s name in a voice pregnant with pain and apprehension, and then the  watchers saw him stop at the front and survey the burning house for a moment.  The fire had now seized upon every part of the building, and threw up great  tongues of flame against the black sky. Only for a second he stood, and then  they saw him dash at the door and drive it in with his shoulder, and presently  he disappeared amidst the flames and smoke.</p>
<p>The people who had now collected  about the burning house drew closer and gazed into the flames, speechless and  pale with terror. The moments dragged by, and they waited, the great fear  growing upon them as the walls trembled, and the long, spiral flames were flung  higher and higher into the windless night. Still they waited, scarcely  breathing. The suspense became intolerable. Men looked into each other&rsquo;s eyes  with fearful meaning, and dry tongues passed over drier lips. At length an  overwrought woman shrieked aloud, and sank upon her knees, hiding her face in  the folds of her dress. And then the roof was seen to rise upwards and  outwards, the whole building vibrated, and, with a roaring and hissing of  flames, collapsed into a glowing ruin, from which the sparks rose in clouds,  and about which the flames ran and curled like great serpents.</p>
<p>The watchers knew now that Bert  Petersen would never come forth again. The women sobbed, crouching on the  ground. The men, white-faced and dumb, stood gazing stupidly into the fire,  paralyzed by the sense of their impotence.</p>
<p>Not till Ragan, the mounted  constable from Magpie, arrived did they find tongue, and as the tale was told  Ragan&rsquo;s face grew grey under its accustomed bronze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was burned trying to rescue his  wife, you say?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a mad attempt,&rdquo; said the  now sobered Collier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas,&rdquo; continued the constable  in a harsh voice; &ldquo;for his wife wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s eloped with young Arthur  Grey, the dude at the post-office, damn her. They cleared out from Magpie together  on the up train!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AftertheAccident"></a>After the Accident</h2>
<p>One man&nbsp;sat upon a  heap of broken reef near the face, with his broad palms supporting his chin.  His thin, hollow cheeks showed, between the out-spread fingers, a sickly yellow  in the candle-light. One candle in a spiked holder burned against the side of  the drive. Two billies and two full crib-bags hung near on dog-hooks driven in  an upright leg, and at the man&rsquo;s feet lay a couple of picks and a shovel. Kyley  sat with his back to the face, staring with glowing, vindictive eyes into the  gathered gloom down the drive, where the passage to the shaft was choked to the  roof with splintered timber and fallen mullock, and where the head of a second  man was dimly visible. Only the head and shoulders of this other were free; the  rest of his body was hidden under the d&eacute;bris . The second man was thrown face  downwards; across his back, pinning his arms, lay the great cap-piece, which  alone seemed heavy enough to have crushed the life out of him. Beyond this the  tumbled reef and splintered slabs were piled to the roof.</p>
<p>But the buried miner was not  dead. The tough red-gum log, forced down by the mighty pressure, had ploughed  its way diagonally down the side of the drive, and pinched him to the floor,  stopping when the pressure of another inch must have been followed by certain  and speedy death. A stout iron truck was jammed under the log beside him, torn  and doubled like a cardboard box. The young man could lift his chin a few  inches from the floor of the drive, and turn his face from one side to the  other, but was incapable of any other movement.</p>
<p>Presently he spoke. His voice  came with an effort, and sounded feebly shrill, like that of a very old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick, Dick! in the name o&rsquo; God,  speak, man! D&rsquo;ye think there&rsquo;s a chance fer us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick Kyley dropped his hands, and  there was an expression of grim satisfaction in his gaunt face as he replied  deliberately&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a chance for me, William. &rdquo;</p>
<p>The buried man lifted his  clay-smirched face, startled by the other&rsquo;s tone, and gazed eagerly at his  mate, and continued gazing for fully a minute, puzzled and frightened by the  incongruous levity in the face that confronted him. Then, the position becoming  painful, he dropped his cheek in the wet clay again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean?&rdquo; he asked  anxiously. &ldquo;Why only fer you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, William, I don&rsquo;t think  you&rsquo;ve got a dog&rsquo;s Show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The reply was without a trace of  sympathy; there was, in fact, a touch of malicious banter in the mincing tone  of the &ldquo;William.&rdquo; William Hether had never been anything but &ldquo;Hether&rdquo; or &ldquo;Bill&rdquo;  to his shift-mate before.</p>
<p>Again Hether looked anxiously  into Kyley&rsquo;s face. Its cadaverous hollows were filled with dark shadows, and  the high-lights brought out the salient features in a grotesque caricature that  struck Hether as simply fiendish. He turned from the sight, with a new horror  in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t no time to fool a  man, Dick,&rdquo; he said humbly. &ldquo;How can there be any chance fer you if I ain&rsquo;t in  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kyley arose, plucked the candle  from the wall, and advancing close to his mate held the flame low down and  showed him a small pool of water gathered upon the floor within 18 inches of  his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Hether understood, and a cry  broke from his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it back, Dick!&rdquo; he gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; said Kyley, calmly replacing  the candle and resuming his former position on the reef, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fool. That  water&rsquo;s coming in from the face, as usual. The fall has dammed the gutters, and  it can&rsquo;t get away; consequently, in less&rsquo;n five hours the pool will be above  your ears. And you know what that means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you can build a dam around  me. Get the shovel-quick! Make a dam with that loose reef an&rsquo; the clay off the  floor. Dick, Dick! give us a chance, for God&rsquo;s sake, man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hether stopped short, staring at  the other, who sat calmly regarding him. Presently he spoke again in a  quavering whisper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t see a man drown  without lendin&rsquo; a hand t&rsquo; help him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t see it,&rdquo; replied  Kyley, &ldquo;because I&rsquo;m goin&rsquo; to douse this light. A candle burns up the air, an&rsquo;  I&rsquo;ll want all there is here, I reckon, before the boys reach me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Driven almost wild with terror, a  terror occasioned no less by the grim significance of Kyley&rsquo;s leering  countenance and the brutality of the words than by the horrors of his position,  Hether began to plead piteously, with tears and moanings. The pain of broken  bones and the sickness of exhaustion had quite unmanned &ldquo;Big Bill Hether;&rdquo; but  his agony did not touch the heart of Kyley, who seemed to have forgotten that  death also threatened him in the delight that the young man&rsquo;s sufferings  awakened within his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;ve you rounded &rsquo;on me, Dick?  What&rsquo;ve I done&mdash;what&lsquo;ve I ever done?&rdquo; moaned the helpless man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not goin&rsquo; to lift a finger  to keep you out of hell,&rdquo; answered the other, &ldquo;because of her, William&mdash;because  of Hannah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill turned his face to the light  again, and once more he stared at Kyley, sharply, inquiringly, reading every  line of his fateful countenance. Then a groan of despair broke from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go away, Kyley,&rdquo; he  said&mdash;&ldquo;true&rsquo;s Christ, if we get out I&rsquo;ll go away, an&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll never hear of me  again. Only make a dam. Quick, man, quick&mdash;it&rsquo;s comin&rsquo;! God! this is worse than  murder. Dick&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water, having filled the  depression at the side of the drive, was now running down and forming a pool in  the hollow under Hether&rsquo;s chin.</p>
<p>Kyley turned and blew out the  candle. For a long time Hether continued to supplicate in the darkness, and  Kyley, leaning comfortably against the face, heard the thin voice, weakening to  an almost inarticulate whisper, beseeching by all that is good on earth and  holy in heaven for a little grace&mdash;another poor chance of life&mdash;and answered  never a word. By a painful effort the young man continued to keep his mouth  above the gathering water, but gradually the torture that afflicted his  extended neck became unendurable, and now in his last extremity he railed at  Kyley as a murderer, and abused him with curses in weak, childish tones that  were nevertheless pregnant with passion, and sounded distinctly and with  terrifying emphasis in that black chamber of death.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was silence. Dick  Kyley listened, and presently heard a bubbling sound in the water. That ceased,  and all was still. He felt now that his vengeance was complete&mdash;that Hether was  dead, and at that moment the fierce emotions of resentment and revenge&mdash;hunger  that had possessed and upheld him departed in a breath, and left him weak and  cowed. His limbs trembled, and beads of perspiration gathered about the roots  of his hair and rolled coldly upon his brow and cheeks. He was thinking, too,  of his own wretched case. He heard, fitfully, a distant drumming, the sound of  timber being driven home, and knew that the rescue parties were working as hard  as men may work, but whether theirs would be a job of hours or days he could not  tell, and already he fancied he detected some taint of vitiation in the air.</p>
<p>Dick Kyley, sitting alone in the  blackness of his prison, waiting for salvation or death, was soon the victim of  an ungovernable fear, a supernatural terror entirely new to him, and the more  awful for its novelty. From the moment he believed Hether dead he began to fear  him. He strove with all the energy of his strong sense to drive him from his  thoughts, but do what he might his mind would revert to the dread subject, and  his eyes turn, staring intently into the darkness, where at times they seemed  to detect a yet blacker form in the pitch-black night that filled the drive&mdash;the  shape of the dead man&rsquo;s head. The horror grew, and with it an agonizing  conviction that Hether&rsquo;s dead face was staring at him with dead but seeing  eyes. Imagination had pictured the pallid cheeks stained with blood and clay,  and the wide, accusing eyes, till the vision became a reality to him. Tortured  beyond endurance, Kyley fumbled in his pocket and found a match, which he  struck upon the shovel blade. As the light filled the chamber a groan of relief  broke from the miner&rsquo;s labouring breast. Only the back of Hether&rsquo;s head was  visible; his face was sunk to the temple in the water. Dick extinguished the  match&mdash;his last&mdash;and sat down again, only to struggle with another relay of  horrors that presently arose against him.</p>
<p>William Hether still lived. He  had discovered that by taking a deep breath and sinking his face till the  forehead rested upon the clay he was enabled to allay the pain in his neck and  to continue the struggle. He persisted in this course, noiselessly, for the  sound of the rescuers at work had filled him with a glorious hope, and with  that hope had come a fear that Kyley might be moved to murder him if he thought  his rescue possible.</p>
<p>So another hour fled. The water  in the drive, which had now found a broad level, continued to rise slowly.  Kyley had lost the power of appreciating time, and sat huddled against the  wall, distraught with fear and despair. Hether&rsquo;s face was haunting him again,  standing forth visibly, threatening and awful in the tomb-like darkness. His  mad fancy stretched every hour of his imprisonment into a long day, and he  believed that it was his fate to be stifled by the foul gases from his mate&rsquo;s  decomposing corpse. Even now the taint was in his nostrils. Although he was  listening all the time with agonized intensity, he no longer heard the  hammering of the miners beyond; his mind was too full of its unspeakable  fear&mdash;he awaited the attack of the inhuman thing that his irresponsible  faculties had fashioned out of the impenetrable gloom at the end of his narrow  prison. At this crisis Hether called again, in a piercing voice, full of the  supreme terror:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help! Kyley, you murderer!  fiend devil&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the first sound of the voice,  Kyley sprang back against the end of the drive, and shrieked, with all the  power of his lungs, again and again; and there he remained, crouched down,  pressing his face into the gravel, clutching his ears, shivering and moaning.</p>
<p>Three hours later the rescuers  broke through, and found Hether under the fall, with his head in a pool of  water, dead, and Kyley squatting at the face, babbling of spectres and devils.</p>
<p>It is still Mr. Richard Kyley&rsquo;s  quaint belief that he is a conspicuous figure in hell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="BennosLittleBoshter"></a>Benno&rsquo;s Little Boshter</h2>
<p>It was&nbsp;Monday  morning. Benno loitered at the packer&rsquo;s bench. The clerk was possessed with a  great unrest, and his high stool could not hold him today.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s er little boshter!&rdquo; he  said vehemently. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; orter seen &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair &rsquo;r dark&rdquo;&rdquo; asked Feathers,  with the intention of showing a friendly interest in the matter. This was the  fifth time Benno had declaimed on the &ldquo;boshter&rdquo; qualities of the unknown, and  fraternal sympathy could not be longer deferred with decency. Feathers delayed  the completion of a knot, and bit off a morsel of tobacco. He solaced business  hours with an occasional quid, smoking on the premises being strictly  prohibited by order of the Czar below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair,&rdquo; replied Benno, with  rapture, &ldquo;with bloo eyes, &rsquo;n&rsquo; er mouth like er bloomin&rsquo; baby. Never saw  anythin&rsquo; like it. She&rsquo;s ther show biscuit, take it from ther man in ther  business&mdash;ther top apple, th&rsquo; &rsquo;ole blessed cake-walk, &rsquo;n&rsquo; straight ez er church.  Yeh can see it stickin&rsquo; out. Bin well brought up, yeh know&mdash;bit shy, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  romantic, &rsquo;n&rsquo; all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentle little maiden of  today,&rdquo; sang Goudy, the town traveller, to himself, absently, as he reached for  twenty-eight of sixes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah-h-h go&rsquo;n &rsquo;ave er scratch!&rdquo;  retorted the clerk, bitterly. The town traveller was a Scot, but the insult had  no sting for him; he went on cheerfully sorting out his order. &ldquo;Some men,&rdquo; said  Benno, with cold despair, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t got no more fine feelin&rsquo; than a hotel cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she left the village she  was shy,&rdquo; hummed the town traveller, changing his tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;appened dead simple,&rdquo; Benno  continued, turning a contemptuous shoulder on Goudy. &ldquo;Me &rsquo;n&rsquo; Billy King was  standin&rsquo; on ther usual corner, Satedee night, watchin&rsquo; ther little toms  trippin&rsquo; it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; sortin&rsquo; out samples, y&rsquo; know; when &rsquo;long she comes with &rsquo;er  cobber, &rsquo;n&rsquo; blessed iv she don&rsquo;t chance an eye on me noble&mdash;jest er little  frightened sort iv look, but, s&rsquo;elp me, I was fittted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goudy put his forefinger to his  lip, and dropped a lopsided curtsey. &ldquo;Oh, sir, me father&rsquo;s a clergyman,&rdquo; he  simpered, &ldquo;and I used to play the organ once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her cobber seemed t&rsquo; be quite  took with Billy&rsquo;s lip whisker,&rdquo; said Benno, his air and attitude insinuating  that the town traveller was offensively dead, &ldquo;n&rsquo; yeh know what Billy is. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll  word &rsquo;em when they pass again,&rsquo; he says, &rsquo;n&rsquo; struth he done it. Billy&rsquo;s ther  pure glassey. &lsquo;Iv course you know my friend, Percy Chirnside, Miss Fortesque&rdquo;&rsquo;  ses he t&rsquo; ther fair one, havin&rsquo; took over th&rsquo; other. She blushed, &rsquo;n&rsquo; smiled,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; said somethin&rsquo; about not having ther pleasure, &rsquo;n&rsquo; in two ticks we was  lifelong cobbers, me &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;er. &lsquo;Course, I sees &rsquo;er &rsquo;ome, &rsquo;n&rsquo; we parts at ther  gate. &rsquo;Er father, being &rsquo;ead salesman at Gum &rsquo;a&rsquo; Tumbledon&rsquo;s is er bit stiff on  ettiket &rsquo;n&rsquo; all that. But she meets me Sund&rsquo;y afternoon. Feathers, there was  nothin&rsquo; on ther grass t&rsquo; touch &rsquo;er. She&rsquo;s er little boshter&mdash;er <em>boshter</em>!  &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;m &rsquo;er one &rsquo;n&rsquo; only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers winked hard at Goudy,  keeping a smooth and sympathetic cheek to Benno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Minds me iv er little lady I  carried lollies to seven years ago,&rdquo; Feathers said, softly. &ldquo;She had feathery,  flaxen &rsquo;air, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a neye like ther grace iv &rsquo;Eaven, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she walked about with  &rsquo;em turned up t&rsquo; &rsquo;allelujah, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a nym-book pressed to &rsquo;er &rsquo;eart. She died  lingerin&rsquo; iv some kind iv saintly disease, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve never bin the same man  since.&rdquo; Here Goudy wiped his own eye, and passed the handkerchief to Feathers,  and the packer mopped up a covert tear. &ldquo;I took ther teetotal, &rsquo;n&rsquo; learned some  hymns, &rsquo;n&rsquo; cried on her grave every fine Sund&rsquo;y afternoon for er week &rsquo;r more,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; cot lumbago through it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; passed away in er little white shimmy &rsquo;n&rsquo; er  pale-blue light, callin&rsquo; her name in er low sweet voice.&rdquo; Feathers broke down,  and Goudy, despite his fifty dishonourable years, uttered a desolate cry, and  besought the packer to come up some evening, and tell that beautiful story to  his poor old bedridden mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pigs to you!&rdquo; said Benno, with  incredible scorn&mdash;&ldquo;ther pair iv yeh,&rdquo; and he returned sulkily to his desk.</p>
<p>This was a strange development in  Benno the cynic&mdash;Benno who had been in the swarming factory from his boyhood,  and who on his high stool had looked down upon a world of women, and learnt the  sex off like a nursery rhyme. True, his attitude towards girls had always been  indulgent, but it was the indulgence of a superior being. At twenty-one one is  no longer deceived by women, but it does not follow that Benno took no delight  in the human girl. It is pleasant to be appreciated by her; it is pleasant to  give her the rapture one&rsquo;s kindly notice may confer; so that Benno dressed with  many precautions and great difficulty on Saturday evenings, and loved to walk  with a young gentleman friend of kindred tastes where the girls were thickest  in the favourite city street; and, if a fair percentage looked at him with dawning  interest as he passed, he was happy. Spats&rsquo; Beauties, as a rule, were ignored,  but he did not disdain to escort the better-dressed pasters in the great  mashing march along the crowded pave. He loved to be seen with women&mdash;it helped  his reputation as a young devil.</p>
<p>A Panama hat, a high, white,  turn-over collar, a small, gay, mechanical tie, a dark suit, carefully creased  to preserve a fictitious air of newness, tan boots, a clean shave, and a  cigarette, all went to the making of Benno. For the rest, he had a pimply,  thin, somewhat foxy face, pale with the pallor that belonged to Spats&rsquo; factory,  and his right ear drooped like a wilted lily. His expression was one of  unnatural precocity, his attitude of mind that of a small and early humorist.  He was artificially funny at the expense of all things on earth below and in  the heavens above; his conversation was supposed to be delightfully light and  sparkling, and consisted mainly of a large collection of street gags and  fanciful phrases. Sometimes the clerk spent sixpence or ninepence, perhaps even  one shilling, on drinks, which expenditure carried with it the splendid  privilege of extending an airy patronage to the barmaid; but Benno did not like  drink, and the fine moment came in the gay roll forth from the bar, with a  flourish of handkerchiefs and a fusillade of badinage. That, too, was necessary  to the part of the young devil. Really, when &lsquo;on his own&rsquo; Benno had no vices,  and was of a frugal mind; his Savings Bank pass book was tattered and limp, and  stained with long service.</p>
<p>And now the cynical and  worldly-wise Mr Ben Dickson was raving over the perfections of a mere girl with  yellow hair and the mouth of a baby, despite the fact that he had seen golden  hair come and go on black-browed Beauties time and again, and in defiance of  his knowledge of the guile that lurks behind little red lips. His yearning for  a confidant drove him back to the packer&rsquo;s bench within an hour. He proudly  displayed a coloured photograph in a rolled-gold locket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present from &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he said  proudly. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t she ther pick iv ther peaches&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; she never took up with er  lad before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neat enough bit iv skirt,&rdquo; said  Feathers, critically. &ldquo;Saucy eye, that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; like it,&rdquo; replied Benno,  with spirit. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s ez fresh ez eggs. She don&rsquo;t know A.B.&mdash;ab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;er &rsquo;air ez yaller ez all  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pure gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ain&rsquo;t gold that glitters,  Benno, my boy. Does it wear well&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me! But iv course you can&rsquo;t  be expected t&rsquo; have no idea iv the points iv er lady in your walk iv life,&rdquo;  replied Dickson, with the superior air of a clerk. &ldquo;This is somethin&rsquo; er cut  above you, for er cert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers beat his parcel square,  threw it on the heap, and spread another sheet of paper. &ldquo;I know I ain&rsquo;t been  movin&rsquo; much in &rsquo;igh society lately,&rdquo; he said, accepting the rebuff; &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; I may  be wrong in thinkin&rsquo; your tom was tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; mash ther man shootin&rsquo; off ther  camera, but I recollec&rsquo; er bloke sayin&rsquo; at this &rsquo;ere bech, Chewsdee last, that  he wouldn&rsquo;t trust no girl with er giggle in her eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she ain&rsquo;t got er giggle, I  tell yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; he also said that most iv  these golden &rsquo;aired pieces was not genuine, just dipped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Jee! She&rsquo;s no fact&rsquo;ry rat.  Do &rsquo;ave er bit iv common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ellis, the foreman, stopped  beside the young men, mumbling plaintively, hurt by the disregard of his  authority shown in their open loafing. Benno lingered only a minute longer, so  that the girls might get no false impression in respect to Ellis&rsquo;s influence  over him.</p>
<p>In the course of the week Benno&rsquo;s  infatuation increased alarmingly. The clerk, hitherto so methodical, became the  victim of a devil of uneasiness. He was up and down his high stool all day  long, like a hungry ape, and he mooned about the room, seeking sympathy from  the Beauties. He even confided in Miss Kruse, the fat, elderly forewoman, and  gushed rapturously and at great length, regardless of the stupid depression  that clung in the flabby folds of her Dutch face. He cornered Ellis himself  behind the guillotines, and poured out his whole soul to him, giving minute  descriptions of Minetta Bird&rsquo;s perfections of character, appearance, dress, and  manner. Minetta Bird was his darling&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Min,&rdquo; he called her, as his  confidence grew more confidential. Before a fortnight had passed he had  confided in every girl on the flat; always in a low, earnest voice, presumably  with the impression that the nature of his communications was unsuspected by  the rest; whereas by this time Benno&rsquo;s &ldquo;boshter&rdquo; had become the choice jibe of  the factory, the printing flat, and the warehouse below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just crazy gone on &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he  told Kitty Coudray; &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; she deserves it. Innocent!&mdash;innocent!&rdquo;&mdash; Benno was  simply confounded in the contemplation of Min&rsquo;s infantile unworldliness, and  words failed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful soft golden &rsquo;air,&rdquo;  murmured the ecstatic voice from the folding board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mouth like a bloomin&rsquo; babby,&rdquo;  cried the ex-professional fat girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; she didn&rsquo;t know it was  loaded,&rdquo; interjected a third voice somewhat irrelevantly, it would seem.</p>
<p>And then came a chorus like a  chant from the four corners of the flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a little boshter!&rdquo; The  expression was repeated three times, with increasing intensity. This had been  adopted as a plan of defence. It threatened to put an end to Benno&rsquo;s  confessions, but the clerk&rsquo;s devotion dulled his sensibilities and subjugated  even his vanity.</p>
<p>It was a good time for the  printer&rsquo;s devil. Billy the Boy had some talent as a caricaturist, and much  stolen leisure; he littered he factory with ribald illustrations of Benno&rsquo;s  courtship, in which Min&mdash;was represented with a wicked leer and a sliding chin,  and giving expression to vulgar sentiments encased in small balloons. He  scattered fictitious love-notes, addressed to Benno and signed &lsquo;The Boshter&rsquo;,  all of which represented Min as a designing creature of the yellowest dye, and  he had a most irritating way of bobbing up above the stair rail at odd moments,  and ejaculating amazedly: &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; her &rsquo;air&rsquo;s ez good ez gold.&rdquo; Mottos casting  ridicule on the innocence and prettiness of Miss Bird were scribbled on the  white-washed walls, and strangers visiting the flat were beset with questions  respecting the character, habits, and appearance of Benno&rsquo;s boshter.</p>
<p>The humour of the town traveller  was particularly offensive. He had a deep sense of gravity, and his method of  attack was to address indirect conversations to the furthest ends of the flat.  His theme was always the infantile virtues of Min. He had a fresh story every  morning, each more preposterous than the other, and his repertoire of  music-hall&mdash;the heroines of which were guileful creatures who hid their vicious  tendencies under golden hair and an ingenious girlishness&mdash;was practically  inexhaustible.</p>
<p>But Benno&rsquo;s mental obfuscation  pulled him through. His infatuation survived all attacks, and one morning he  came in fatuously radiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s promised t&rsquo; be my  wife, ole man,&rdquo; he gasped, grasping the packer&rsquo;s hand, and shaking it with  great heartiness.</p>
<p>Feathers stood it manfully.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t surprise yeh much, does it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thought yeh was prepared for ther  worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand &rsquo;er, Mills.  She&rsquo;s er hangel&mdash;er bloomin&rsquo; hangel&mdash;that&rsquo;s what she is,&rdquo; said Dickson,  fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; cheap,&rdquo;  answered the packer.</p>
<p>Benno was beyond insult and above  anger. He went through the factory bubbling. He bubbled all day. He even  forgave Goudy everything, and bubbled to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; marry me,  Scotty,&rdquo; he said confidentially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;ou brought it on  yourself!&rdquo; answered the town travellor, washing his hands of the whole  business.</p>
<p>Benno told everybody in the  place, bar Spats himself, and for one portentous moment the flat thought he was  even going confide in the boss; but the clerk recollected himself in time, and  pulled up short. For a year after, the Beauties wondered what would have  happened had Benno actually babbled his rapture to the master. The majority  favoured the opinion that Spats would have burst on the spot.</p>
<p>After this, Dickson&rsquo;s raving took  a new form; it was now all of the little cottage and the furnishing. He was  leaving everything to Min, excepting, of course, the unimportant part of  financing the business; that was his pleasant duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh know, Feathers, she&rsquo;s no  bally nark; er bloke kin trust &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; she&rsquo;s got taste, mind yeh.  &rsquo;Er father was er winder-dresser once. She took er pretty little cottage, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  furnishin&rsquo; it good &rsquo;n&rsquo; fine. I&rsquo;m outer all that; don&rsquo;t even know where ther  crib is. When all&rsquo;s finished, we rings up ther parson, do ther trick, all  rights reserved, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I sails inter me little &rsquo;ome, all Sir Garney oh. That&rsquo;s er  idea. Just ther thing, eh, what. Oh, yeh can&rsquo;t push er down. She&rsquo;s er boshter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The happy date arrived. Benno was  allowed two days off on full pay to celebrate the event. Spats liked his hands  to marry; it made them submissive, he thought; hence the liberality. Benno  returned on the third day, and the Beauties greeted him yell as he mounted the  stairs. The yell died away when Dickson came fully into view. Benno the jaunty  was no more; a grey-faced, pinched, hollow-eyed, broken wretch confronted them.  The clerk almost staggered to the packer&rsquo;s bench, and, leaning upon it, passed  a nervous hand over his eyes. There was an abject piteousness in his face, his  lips trembled, a tear rolled down his cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bin done, Feathers,&rdquo; he  blurted. &ldquo;She&mdash;she&rsquo;s er speiler.&rdquo; Benno&rsquo;s head dropped, he cried before them  all, sobbing without shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, ain&rsquo;t yeh married, then&rdquo;  asked Feathers.</p>
<p>Benno shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he  said; &ldquo;she never turned up. I &rsquo;unted fer ther &rsquo;ouse yesterdee &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther day  before. I&mdash;I found it. It was furnished beautiful.&rdquo; Benno&rsquo;s feelings overcame  him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; ther girl&rdquo; prompted  Feathers, eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;d&mdash;she&rsquo;d married another  feller, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he was livin&rsquo; in my &rsquo;ouse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goudy let fall the parcel he had  taken up when Benno entered. His face was set hard, like that of a stone man He  walked straight to the stairs, head erect, and went down past each flat right  into the cellar, and at the far end, in the darkness, among the bales, he sat  down and exploded, and the echoes of his mad subterranean laughter came faintly  up to the factory. But there was no laughing there. Benno was weeping at his  desk, and the Beauties were storming in throes of indignation righteous and  profound. Hours later the factory generously offered to &ldquo;deal with&rdquo; Min but  Benno, with a touch of his old self, said that it didn&rsquo;t matter; he had  consulted his solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AHotDayatSpats"></a>A Hot Day at Spats&rsquo;</h2>
<p>The day&nbsp;was hot.  The industrious little tin thermometer over packer&rsquo;s bench registered 103&deg;, not  out, and the atmosphere of the long flat was as oppressive as a burden, and  heavy with motes. The factory was low-roofed and ill-ventilated. Through the  row of dingy western windows the afternoon sun shot broad beams that shimmered  in the dull interior like strips of white-hot steel. To many of the sallow  girls at the pasting boards it seemed that they were supporting the ceiling  with their stiff and aching heads. The factory sulked; all brows were lowering,  and lips drooped with a sickly petulance. Several of the piece-workers,  confirmed grafters, toiled with swift fingers, hanging desperately to the task,  but the majority of the Beauties leaned upon their boards indolently, moving  their limbs with slow effort. The flat was gusty with sighs. It was impossible  to hold the paid hands to their tables; the forewomen kept up a continual  whining, and Ellis fluttered about uneasily, tremulous with apprehension, the  paper-dust and the sweat coagulating into mud in his scattered tufts of  whiskers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, now, girls!&rdquo; the foreman&rsquo;s  timorous expostulation was almost as insistent as the ticking of the big clock.  &ldquo;Now, now, girls&mdash;now, now!&rdquo; The Beauties treated him with full disdain; they  had no heart even for insolence.</p>
<p>That part of the flat which  turned to the left, out of the sight of Ellis at his cutting-machines, was  piled to the rafters with stock and bales, and here were the dressing-rooms.  This was the favourite rendezvous of the impudent shirkers, too, and now and  again the foreman made an angry excursion along the dark passages between the  piles of goods, driving the loafers forth, with pathetic reproaches and threats  of dismissal.</p>
<p>From behind one of the stacks an  unhealthy-looking girl, of about eighteen, with a tousled mass of dull red  hair, made pantomimic efforts to attract the packer. Feathers was very sad. He  was a man with a thirst that became an actual infliction under the stress of  103&deg; in the shade&mdash;&ldquo;Worse &rsquo;n&rsquo; neuralger,&rdquo; he complained&mdash;but Odgson, whose office  stock of uncustomed whisky never ran short, was scandalized by anything like  drinking habits in the lower orders, and alcoholic beverages were strictly  prohibited upstairs. Feathers&rsquo; affliction cut into his earnings. Already he had  gone forth secretly as a passionate pilgrim, but his limited credit at the Star  and Garter was exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo; &rsquo;a&rsquo; b&rsquo;lieved &rsquo;twas in  er &rsquo;uman woman t&rsquo; be ez firm ez what that Mrs Publican is,&rdquo; he told Bruno,  bitterly. &ldquo;Wimmin ain&rsquo;t fit t&rsquo; keep pubs; they ain&rsquo;t got no compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers was thinking over these  things, with a dull pain at his heart and a mouth &ldquo;like a drought-struck bone  mill&rdquo;, when his eye fell upon Linda gesticulating in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, get up yer pole!&rdquo; Feathers  hated frivolity at a moment like this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-oh, Feathers,&rdquo; hissed  Linda. &ldquo;Come &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;av&rsquo; a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer was about to descend  to the vulgar in his anguish, when an action of Linda&rsquo;s swept the black  thoughts from his soul. The girl had raised her right hand to her face, her  head was tilting slowly backwards, rhythmical ripples ran along her white  throat. Feathers shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanin&rsquo;&rdquo; he pointed to the  centre of his breast, and his eyes were round with inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair dinkum,&rdquo; telegraphed Linda.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right-o, then. In arf er tick.&rdquo;  Feathers ran a casual eye over the room, took up a parcel, and carried it round  the bend. In a small space between a stack and the wall four or five were  crowded round a large billy. The billy had liquor in it. Feathers recognized it  at a glance, and half the misery of a hard life fell from him. It was beer.  Linda dipped a cupful and offered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, what sort&rdquo; The packer  spoke in stern expostulation. But he took the cup. &ldquo;This means ther dirty push  fer ther lot iv yer copped,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats,&rdquo; said Carrie Bent. &ldquo;Ole  Spats&rsquo; rotten fact&rsquo;ry ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;eaven, is it? Run it in, Jud, I&rsquo;m fair hungry for  another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howdja work it&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New cove from the mill smuggled  it up the lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s er fair cop out iv yer  cort. Mind, I told yeh.&rdquo; Feathers thought he was being very firm, but the arm  that held the cup was weakening visibly. The cup moved towards his face as if  of its own volition. &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; it&rsquo;s rotten bad fer yeh beer is, this weather,&rdquo; he  continued. &ldquo;It goes t&rsquo; yer &rsquo;ead.&rdquo; What further wisdom the packer might have  spoken was stopped by the arrival of the cup at his lips. He seemed surprised  to find it there. Something like a feat of legerdemain followed, and the beer  was swept away.</p>
<p>Linda took the cup and served one  round, Feathers standing over, moralizing. Then came the sound of Ellis&rsquo;s  familiar hobble, and instantly the billy went out of sight under a sack and  behind a bale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What rot, girls; why don&rsquo;t yer  get er shift on&rdquo; cried Feathers virtuously, making himself right. &ldquo;&rsquo;Taint ther  mealy pertater, polin&rsquo; on the firm like this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, come,&rdquo; spluttered  Ellis. &ldquo;Get to your boards, I&rsquo;ll fine you&mdash;every one of you.&rdquo; A trifling revolt  was sufficient to rob Fuzzy of what little understanding and self-control he  possessed. He took every dereliction to heart as a personal wrong. His voice  ran shrill in an agony of reproach, and, as he stumped after the girls, the  timid, nervous man pitifully asserting himself, he ran blindly into a bale,  cannoned on to a case of white note, and fell into the truck. The foreman fell  into, or over, one or the other of the trucks at least once a day, and the joke  had lost point. The Beauties remained sullen, some sprawling over their boards,  openly loafing, their bare arms hanging down, their figures sharply outlined in  thin skirts and skimpy bodices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead hookity, I call it,&rdquo; said  the packer sympathetically, as he helped Ellis out of his complication with the  truck.</p>
<p>The foreman turned to his machines,  whimpering &ldquo;Now, now, girls; come, come now!&rdquo; as he passed the boards. Feathers  returned to his bench. He packed with some little energy for ten minutes, and  then the knowledge that there was illicit beer on the flat began to prey upon  his mind. He sighed frequently; his nagging thirst got at him again. The heat  came through the factory in successive clouds. In answer to some weary  pleasantry that came up the speaking tube, he said distinctly that life was a  &ldquo;blasted fraud&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the Union Brewery&rdquo; asked  the voice, after an sniff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nah, it&rsquo;s &rsquo;ell&rsquo;s stokehole, yer  Jack chump.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few minutes later Feathers paid  another urgent visit to the billy. The beer was tepid, but he returned  refreshed. The factory was almost silent under the heat and burden of the day,  saving for the rattle of the cogs of the guillotines and the whirr of the  sewing machines ripping out leagues of meal bags. The girls had nothing to say  for themselves. They were stripped to the last rag within the requirements of  decency. The ex-professsional fat girl, working hard, was a humid mountain;  there was an uncanny look in her set face. Benno drowsed at his desk. Much  latitude was permitted to the clerk these days, in consideration of a recent  sorrow. The air of the factory was heavy with the tang of humanity. The curse  of Adam brooded in the room.</p>
<p>The printer&rsquo;s devil below sang a  line of &ldquo;Climbing up the Golden Stairs&rdquo;. It was the &ldquo;office&rsquo;. Feathers snatched  something from his drawer, bit off an ample mouthful and chewed. Spats&rsquo; belltopper  loomed above the stairs. Spats followed. The &ldquo;guv&rsquo;-nor&rsquo;s&rdquo; face was purple with  heat and emotion, and large beads of oil glistened upon his tuberous nose. The  machines whirred with new vigour, the Beauties made a spiritless effort to look  busy, Benno drove his pen with a great show of energy, and the owner stood and  glared over the factory under his clumps of brow. His look was one of  unmeasured hatred. He grunted, and his grunt was expressive of great loathing.  He turned, and shuffled along the flat till he came to the packer&rsquo;s bench.  There he paused and sniffed. He sniffed at Feathers repeatedly, like an angry  dog, and grunted three times&mdash;rising grunts of fathomless disgust&mdash;the last  almost a snort. Then he passed downstairs again.</p>
<p>Feathers leaned over the rail.  &ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s Whiskers!&rdquo; he hissed. The expression might have lacked point but it  relieved him. It was cheese the packer was eating&mdash;very old cheese, and very  strong for its age. It was not nice cheese, but it had the virtue of  subordinating the smell of any beer that might be within an acre at the time of  eating.</p>
<p>The whirr of the machines  softened again. The cogs clanked no more. Benno&rsquo;s head sank, and the Beauties  abandoned all pretensions. The heated atmosphere came up the stairways, and  grew denser in the top flat; breathing was a labour, and the packer&rsquo;s head was  humming like a mill. He was thinking of the unguarded beer behind the bale.</p>
<p>Suddenly the factory was  disturbed by a thin crying&mdash;a low, helpless crying that had an animal-like agony  in it. The fat girl was wailing at her boards. Her large face shone white; she  still worked with deft fingers, but she wept at her task like an insensate  creature. Ellis understood what it meant; he had heard it before more than  once, and instantly he fell into his familiar condition of terror-stricken  irresponsibility. He scrambled down the room, knocking against all the boards,  throwing tiers of work into confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, here&mdash;you stop it!&rdquo; he  cried. &ldquo;Stop it! Stop it, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little girl at the folding board  was making strange gasping noises. Many of the girls seemed to become suddenly  possessed of a bovine fear. Sarah Eddie ran to Martha Rickards, and put strong  arms about her, whereupon the fat girl flopped upon the floor, and her crying  increased to an agonized scream. The little girl at the folding-board fell back  convulsed. Two other girls started crying, and Ellis ran foolishly from one to  the other, pleading and complaining. Feathers alone remained cool. He was  experienced in all the foolishness of women. The packer leaned over the stair  and called down to the printers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, er couple iv you blokes  len&rsquo;s a &rsquo;and Fat&rsquo;s down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A couple of printers bounded up  from the lower flat, and Feathers took command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah-h! go &rsquo;n&rsquo; get hosed!&rdquo; he  said, contemptuously, to the foreman, who was fussing uselessly. &ldquo;Grab er &rsquo;ead,  lads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat girl was now screaming in  violent hysterics. Feathers took her heels, the printers her arms, and, with  Sarah&rsquo;s help, they carried their great burden to the lift.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take &rsquo;er inter ther cellar an&rsquo;  let &rsquo;er bloomin&rsquo; well &rsquo;ave it out there,&rsquo; &rsquo;r she&rsquo;ll &rsquo;ave ther &rsquo;ole fact&rsquo;ry  &rsquo;owlin&rsquo; mad in &rsquo;arf a tick.&rdquo; The fat girl was promptly lowered, and Feathers  turned to his other patients.</p>
<p>Chrissie M&lsquo;Fadyen, a tall dark girl, had fallen in a huddled heap under her board, and was making weird,  choking noises. Feathers straightened her out, pillowed her head on a pile of  bags and said angrily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up&rsquo;! D&rsquo; yeh &rsquo;ear? We ain&rsquo;t  doin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo; in fancy fits today.&rdquo; Then with extreme disdain: &ldquo;Arr-r-r, ring  off, can&rsquo;t yeh!&rdquo; The girl shivered, stiffened her limbs, and opened a startled  eye. &ldquo;Nah, then, Mac, that&rsquo;ll do you. Just you take a &rsquo;ammerlock holt iv  yerself, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;ave some dam&rsquo; consideration fer others.&rdquo; The tone was brutal.  Chrissie struggled with her symptoms, and conquered. &ldquo;Take &rsquo;er away &rsquo;n&rsquo;  sprinkle &rsquo;er,&rdquo; said Feathers to one of the machinists, and Chrissie M&lsquo;Fadyen  was led to the taps, weeping quietly.</p>
<p>The packer passed on to Ginger  Copin, the foreman dancing at his heels and stuttering like a cranky monkey. It  seemed as if half the girls might get out of hand at any moment. Many were  crying. Feathers took Ginger by the shoulders in a masterful grip, and shook  her to emphazise his biting rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shine idyit you makin&rsquo; o&rsquo;  yerself, Copin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Bli&rsquo; me, have er bit iv common. Stow it; stow it,  d&rsquo;ye hear&rdquo; Ginger strove against her racked nerves, and looked surprised and  piteous. Feathers was not to be softened, however. He said further things to  Copin, and they were not tender and soothing things. In short he cursed her  from boots to breakfast; and Copin revived as under cooling showers, and was  led away by the stronger girls.</p>
<p>Feathers swore bitterly at a  couple of weeping pasters in passing, and braced them up wonderfully; delivered  a scathing expostulation to Miss Bentley, the sedate piece-worker, who gave  marked indications of going off; and then addressed himself to the little girl  at the folding-board, who had fallen in a fit. He carried her to the taps in  the cooler part of the building, sothing the factory with bad, masterful words  as he passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New one, this, ain&rsquo;t she&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s she called&rdquo;</p>
<p>They told him, and he addressed  her by her name; not so sternly as in the former cases and without  bullock-compelling expletives, but with the tone of a man who was not to be  denied. He insisted on her getting well by her own effort. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use tellin&rsquo;  me yeb carn&rsquo;t, y&rsquo;know, &rsquo;cause I know better. Come, come, buck-up!&rdquo; The little  girl was slowly reviving, and although this case took longer than the others,  the patient was presently well enough to go below with the rest.</p>
<p>Feathers went back to the  Beauties, bullying manfully here and there. He picked out three more, cursed  them into some sense of decency, and passed them down to the cellar to cool off;  and behold, the factory was in order again, and clothed in its right mind. The  packer had proved himself master of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you snivel &rsquo;n&rsquo; whine over  wimmen when they&rsquo;re &rsquo;avin&rsquo; &rsquo;sterics &rsquo;n&rsquo; them jiggity fits,&rdquo; he said, wisely, to  the printers; &ldquo;it on&rsquo;y makes &rsquo;em feel they&rsquo;re pore sufferin&rsquo; dears, &rsquo;n&rsquo; they&rsquo;ll  holler their &rsquo;eads off, &rsquo;n&rsquo; kick ther ceilin&rsquo; in outer dashed sympathy fer  themselves. What er woman wants when she&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo; like that is a real beast t&rsquo;  boss her. Yiv gotter work in among &rsquo;em here fer er few years t&rsquo; know what er  consolation er reg&rsquo;lar brute is to er woman now &rsquo;n&rsquo; again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sst&mdash;Pig&rsquo;s Whiskers!&rdquo; hissed  Billy the boy. The printers fled downstairs, and Feathers packed. &ldquo;Pig&rsquo;s  Whiskers&rdquo; was one of the many pet names the factory had given Odgson, the Boss.</p>
<p>Half an hour later a south breeze  was sweeping the factory, and the Beauties were barracking noisily at their  work. Feathers was in an amiable mood; he had emptied the billy, and now walked  with ostentatious uprightness. The fact that there was no longer any alcoholic  beverage on the flat, and that the boss had no just cause for complaint, filled  him with genuine and virtuous satisfaction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheWooingofMinnie"></a>The Wooing of Minnie</h2>
<p>After years&nbsp;spent  in the quest of the perfect boy, Odgson seem satisfied that the species became  extinct when he grew up, and a man was engaged to assist at the guillotines and  do the rouse-about work of the factory. Chiller Green was about twenty-four and  a sinister young man at first sight. He came on to the flat with the tips of  his fingers dipped behind his belt in front, his chin thrust forward, and his  eyes full of truculence. He surveyed the room and its occupants coldly, and his  expression implied a certain disgust at finding himself in such cheap company.  As he glared, his chin moved in a chewing action, leisurely and insolent. The  movement was purely for effect; Chiller had nothing to chew. He had dressed in  a soft black felt hat, high in the crown&mdash;a kind much effected by jockey-boys; a  short, faded coat; trousers very skimped in the waist, and high-heeled boots.</p>
<p>A facetious clerk called up the  tube to Feathers: &ldquo;Accept delivery of the new boy. Please forward receipt at  your convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer grinned. &ldquo;&rsquo;R&rsquo; yow ther  new boy&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Chiller looked sidelong at the  packer&rsquo;s feet with contemptuous casualness, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Chiller Green, amachoor bantim  champyin iv ther Port,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; mention it,&rdquo; said Feathers,  cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jest sayin&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued  Chiller, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m man enough t&rsquo; go on with, s&rsquo;posin&rsquo; anyone&rsquo;s wantin&rsquo; anythin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;out!&rdquo; said Feathers; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  contract t&rsquo; bury all your dead with ther fat-money from er brick-mill. Iv  you&rsquo;ve come &rsquo;ere t&rsquo; work, sling off yer coat &rsquo;n&rsquo; move, &rsquo;r the fore-woman &rsquo;ll  smack you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiller spat with scientific  precision, turned slowly away, and slouched towards the changing-room.</p>
<p>The impression Chiller Green  conveyed during those first few minutes proved to be quite erroneous. The new  hand was really a jaunty, companionable youth, and demonstrated as much within  a week by inaugurating a boxing class in the lift corner, and fraternally  blackening the packer&rsquo;s eye during the luncheon hour. The boxing-gloves were  extemporized out of pairs of working stockings discarded by the Beauties. Green  was the pride of a suburban &ldquo;push&rdquo;, and was certainly not more impudent than  was excusable in a man who could &ldquo;hook&rdquo; with both hands and had &ldquo;done time&rdquo;  because a bush-bred policeman had no more respect for his head than to leave it  in the way when the &ldquo;push&rdquo; was throwing bricks about. Chiller was not backward  in publishing his record. He promised to show Feathers a &ldquo;boshter knack for  passing out gazobs&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got on to it when I was &lsquo;up&rsquo;,&rdquo;  he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar-rn!&rdquo; said the packer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I done my bit,&rdquo; Chiller went  on. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; agen me, though. Jist lined er John with er  half-Brunswick, &rsquo;n&rsquo; got four moon. Knocked him fair off his trolly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iv it gets known here they&rsquo;ll  bounce yeh on ther pavement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My trubs! I&rsquo;d have er cut at ole  Spats hisself if &rsquo;e looked cock-eyed at me.&rdquo; Chiller titled his truck-load on  to its base, put his hands up to nothing, did a shadowy spar, and then danced a  few steps indicative of his cheerful indifference. &ldquo;I kin alwez get back to  ther trade,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;on&rsquo;y it&rsquo;s Chinaman&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; what&rsquo;s yer trade&rdquo; asked  Feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barrerin&rsquo; rabbies. They&rsquo;s money  in it when meat&rsquo;s riz, but pushin&rsquo; a barrer gets er man down, I tell yeh,  specially in the winter mon&rsquo;s. I reckon I&rsquo;ll hang up here &rsquo;n&rsquo; make er name fer  mesilf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope you&rsquo;ll keep us all on when  you take over the business,&rdquo; said the town-traveller.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;bantim champyin&rdquo; sparred at  Gaudy, feinted and baulked in a highly decorative way, and tweaked the big  man&rsquo;s beard, making at the same time a plaintive baa-ing. Then he resumed his  burden and passed on, singing something to the effect that he could get a  sweetheart any day, but not another mother. Chiller&rsquo;s taste in songs inclined  to the sentimental and woebegone.</p>
<p>The town traveller&rsquo;s remark was  called for. Already Chiller Green had assumed dominance in the factory. The deprecatory  Ellis was most polite towards his assistant. The foreman&rsquo;s native timidity  doomed him to be an easy victim to the audacity of young Mr Green. Chiller  respected nobody. When Spats visited the factory flat, the Bantam outraged his  dignity and ruined his influence by ridiculing him with audacious effrontery.  As a compliment to Odgson&rsquo;s hairiness, Chiller had christened him Jo-Jo, and he  indulged in doggy pantomime at the heels of the proprietor, or whined and  yapped plaintively for the edification of the pasters, scattering choice <em>sotto  voce</em> reflections on Spats, his appearance and manners, etc.,  reflections that embraced all Odgson&rsquo;s relations, including a purely  hypothetical Aunt Lucy, and it was carried on with bravado that amounted to  insane recklessness in the minds of the girls, whose dislike for the great man  from below was tempered with a becoming awe.</p>
<p>Chiller&rsquo;s manner towards the  girls was familiar, and flippant. Even the superiority of the two or three  sedate and somewhat elderly pasters, who preserved a certain aloofness, had no  effect upon the Bantam&rsquo;s exuberance, and he maintained for their benefit an  assumption of close and intimate friendship that they seem to find extremely  galling. Miss Stevens was the most reserved of all these. The factory had  endowed her with aristocratic antecedents and romantic misfortune, and even the  ragamuffin Beauties called her &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;. She was thirty and scornful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-oh, Steve! How-de-do-de&rdquo;  was Chiller&rsquo;s morning greeting. Miss Stevens treated him as if he were  something to which the attention of the Board of Health should be drawn at the  earliest possible moment, and, addressing a neighbour, the young man would  continue brightly: &ldquo;Great cobbers, me &rsquo;n&rsquo; Steve. She kin keep nothin&rsquo; from me,  tells me all her secrets. No end iv conferdence in me, she&rsquo;s got. Used t&rsquo; be er  friend o&rsquo; mother&rsquo;s. How&rsquo;s th&rsquo; indigestion this mornin&rsquo;, Sissy&rdquo; Miss Steven&rsquo;s  name was not Sissy; she had no indigestion. Her wrath towards Mr Green was  silent, but very deep.</p>
<p>Benno, the clerk, Mr Green  refused to take seriously, at any time or in any capacity. He called him  &ldquo;Tutsie&rdquo;, and insisted that, despite his present pretensions, his antecedents  were of the lowest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s yer ole pot-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-pan,  Tutsie&rdquo; said Chiller. &ldquo;When I knew him, he was head shop-walker on er  saverloy-can, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer mother was carryin&rsquo; round babies t&rsquo; ther poor, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  runnin&rsquo; er &lsquo;families supplied&rsquo; emporium in Paddy&rsquo;s Alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le&rsquo; go me leg,&rdquo; retorted the  clerk, smartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; &rsquo;ere &rsquo;re you, wearin&rsquo;  made-t&rsquo;-measure suits, &rsquo;n&rsquo; collars what turn down all round, &rsquo;n&rsquo; splashin&rsquo;  yerself agin ther verandy posts iv fine nights, like er young dook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Green&rsquo;s spirits were  guaranteed to keep in any climate. When the factory was cold it was as  inclement as a refrigerating mill, and when it was hot it was suggestive of a  material hell with all the modern improvements in house-warming; but cold or  hot, Green retained his flippancy, and went about his work with abounding  cheerfulness. He frequently paused by the way to put up a vivacious spar with a  stack of parcels, and every now and then he threw in a &ldquo;dead flash&rdquo; scrap of  step-dancing, or sang a couple of lines of a popular music-hall chorus with  original effects.</p>
<p>This was before the Spadger began  to get in her work. The Spadger was a little folder, so called because Feathers  had discovered in her a strong resemblance to a bedraggled sparrow. She was  waspish and thin, with a nose like a cheap wooden doll&rsquo;s, round eyes, and a  mouth puckered into an ineradicable perkiness. Her walk had a confident sort of  hop in it. Her ginger hair was literally dragged into a knot at the back, which  was always misplaced, so that her head had a cunning appearance of being pulled  to one side or the other. She dressed very poorly, and her hats looked like  some few unconsidered trifles collected on a plate. She was old-maidish at  eighteen. Her name was Minnie Silver.</p>
<p>Chiller had been in the factory  two months or more before he noticed Minnie particularly. When he began to  offer her little attentions, his manner was still gaily impertinent, and the  small folder ignored him with elaborate disdain that was a grotesque parody of  the arts and graces of her betters. When she came up the stairs Chiller would  make a burlesque demonstration, dusting the floor, and bustling pasters and  parcels out of the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello there, get off th&rsquo; earth!&rdquo;  cried the Bantam &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere comes ther little Duchess. How&rsquo;s it this mornin&rsquo;, yer  Grace&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Silver&rsquo;s nose would be  hoisted into the air, her under-lip would curl outwards disdainfully, and she would  sweep aside her scarp of faded skirt, and pass on with intense hauteur. Then  Chiller to the packer: &ldquo;Get on to &rsquo;er, Feathers. You see &rsquo;ow she treats me&mdash;me  what never put her away when she stole ther tutsie, &rsquo;n&rsquo; never will, s&rsquo;help me.&rdquo;  The reference to the tutsie (vernacular for cat) was provoked by Minnie&rsquo;s  muff&mdash;a skimpy moth-eaten muff with bald patches&mdash;of which she was rather proud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I &rsquo;ope I got too much  self-respec&rsquo; t&rsquo; have anythink t&rsquo; say t&rsquo; them low larrikins,&rdquo; said Minnie to the  nearest paster.</p>
<p>Mr Green continued in this vein  for some weeks. He never came near Miss Silver without favouring her with some  trifle of banter, and his remarks were personal&mdash;painfully so, they might have  seemed to people of refinement. One afternoon Minnie remarked, in a  high-pitched, thin voice, addressing nobody in particular:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If someone don&rsquo;t know better &rsquo;n  ter sing out after people in the street they&rsquo;ll find out.&rdquo; The speech was  laboriously enigmatic, but Chiller understood. Strange to say, the young man  had no reply.</p>
<p>There was an undercurrent of  sadness in the Bantam&rsquo;s greeting to Miss Silver next morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere she is agin. Ain&rsquo;t she  saucy&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Miss Silver,  disdainfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother, she bit me!&rdquo; Chiller  sparred, side-stepped the town traveller, hit him in the wind, and then danced  a shuffle or two; but it was evident to Feathers that the bloom was passing  from the young man&rsquo;s assurance.</p>
<p>Not long after this the packer  came upon Chiller and Miss Silver behind one of the stacks. Minnie was  supercilious; Chiller was protesting almost pathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I say, Min, get off me face.  Ain&rsquo;t I sweet with yeh! Ain&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; Chiller discovered Feathers at this point, and  fell into a low-comedy vein. He feinted at the stack, ducked in, and put in  some effective half-arm blows on a bundle of fruit-bags; but Feathers was not  deceived. Miss Silver went perkily up the room. Certainly the courtship was  progressing.</p>
<p>After this there was an  unmistakably pathetic appeal in Chiller&rsquo;s banter; and Miss Silver,  understanding her advantage accentuated her haughtiness. She was weazened, and  plain, and miserably dressed, and in all probability had never had an admirer  before, but the most disdainful beauty could not have assumed more airs towards  a hapless suppliant. Indeed, at this stage Miss Silver&rsquo;s performance was an  exquisite piece of comedy. Despite her disdain, instinct prompted the girl to  preen herself with silly little bits of ribbon and scraps of lace, and a small  bunch of second-hand cherries and a turkey feather were added to the quaint  collection in her battered hat. Her scorn for Chiller was rapidly working upon  what strange sense of humour the Beauties possessed. She put herself to no  little trouble to display it. She went out of her way to meet the Bantam in  order to avoid him with unspeakable disdain. She talked at Chiller in a loud,  reedy voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone what&rsquo;s always  follerin&rsquo; someone about in a way what he orter be ashamed of hisself, knowin&rsquo;  he ain&rsquo;t wanted,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better lay poison for him,&rdquo; said  the Fat Girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s yer fatal beauty, Spadger,&rdquo;  suggested Kitty Coudray &ldquo;Cut yer &rsquo;air &rsquo;n&rsquo; sit in the sun till you freckle up,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; then the man might give you a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another paster asked if the  villain who still pursued her was an aide-de-camp or a rich squatter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, &rsquo;e knows what &rsquo;e is well  enough,&rdquo; answered Minnie shrilly, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;e better mind &rsquo;isself, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiller had no answer to make to  these insinuations. They left him depressed. He went about his work quietly. He  had abandoned the boxing-class in the lift-corner, and showed a marked dislike  for the society of Feathers, Goudy, and the ribald printers. Even Billy the Boy  was losing respect for him, and cast painful reflections up and down the  stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Buck up,&rdquo; said Billy, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s  lots better &rsquo;n her in ther dust-box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiller declined to buck up.  Minnie piped something to the effect that she would disdain to be &ldquo;found  drowned with a bloke what done up &rsquo;is &rsquo;air dead leary&rdquo;; next morning the  elaborate festoons had disappeared from Chiller&rsquo;s brow, and his hair was parted  with the oily precision characteristic of Sunday-school superintendents and  reputable young barbers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s scrougers what think  they&rsquo;s jist the lolly in a red tie,&rdquo; piped Minnie, &ldquo;but they ain&rsquo;t respectible  if yer arsk me.&rdquo; Chiller abandoned his red tie. He put away the proud  bob-tailed coat with the buttons on it, because Minnie said acridly of all  wearers of such coats; &ldquo;It shows what they are&mdash;lurchers &rsquo;n&rsquo; rats, the lot iv  &rsquo;em.&rdquo; He lowered his heels for the same reasons and discarded a black-and-white  sweater that he had prized very highly, because Minnie thought sweaters  suggested disreputable sporting connections. But poor young Mr Green&rsquo;s  courtship was not visibly advanced by these concessions. Minnie Silver remained  supercilious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Min, come off,&rdquo; said  Chiller, in sad expostulation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak ter yer equals!&rdquo; sniffed  the little folder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give&rsquo;s er charnce won&rsquo;t yeh&rdquo;  persisted Chiller, following her up.</p>
<p>Minnie gathered up her dingy  skirt, pointed her nose straight at the rafters, and to use Chiller&rsquo;s own  expressive phrase, &ldquo;laid him out cold&rdquo;. Half-an-hour later, speaking from her  place at the board, and addressing the whole factory, Miss Silver cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If people &rsquo;angs round other  people&rsquo;s &rsquo;ouses of nights it&rsquo;s their own look-out if the police gets spoke to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiller Green actually blushed. A  few minutes later, when the Bantam was busy at the machines, and well within  range, Minnie said to Miss Twentyman:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen me out with Mr Eddie,  Sunday, didn&rsquo;t yer, Sis? &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a gentleman &rsquo;e is. Knows how t&rsquo; behave &rsquo;isseif.  Gets &rsquo;s quid a week et Goosie&rsquo;s, solderin&rsquo; jam-tins, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a rise every year. &rsquo;E  don&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave no truck with no low fightin&rsquo; scrougers, &rsquo;e don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Green did not blush this time,  but a light came into his eye that augured ill for Mr Eddie, of Goosie&rsquo;s jam  factory. On the morning of the second day, Minnie was extremely caustic in her  comments on some person or persons of pugnacious quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them what &rsquo;its them what is too  good for them will be made to pay for it, so they better mind out,&rdquo; she said.  Chiller growled a bad expression, and Miss Silver continued moralizing. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  somethin&rsquo; if a young lady can&rsquo;t walk down the street with a friend what&rsquo;s a  gentleman, without &rsquo;im bein&rsquo; dealt with, an&rsquo; &rsquo;is nose punched. But what I sez  is, there&rsquo;s a law for the likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chiller got a day off to attend  his aunt&rsquo;s funeral, and Feathers discovered in the suburban department of an  evening paper an intimation that one James Green had been fined two pounds,  with the alternative of a week&rsquo;s imprisonment, for a grievous and unprovoked  assault on a Mr Henry Eddie in the public street.</p>
<p>Next evening, Chiller said to  Feathers, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m slingin&rsquo; it, blokey, Goin&rsquo; back ter ther trade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I thought barrer-pushin&rsquo; was  er game fer gazobs&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ole Spats can&rsquo;t expect me  ter go on muckin&rsquo; round fact&rsquo;ry fer seventeen-&rsquo;n&rsquo;-a-tizzy. I&rsquo;m thinking iv  gettin&rsquo; married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar-rn!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-a-a-a-s.&rdquo; Chiller sparred a  bit, danced a step or two, and went off singing. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s onlee a wuckin&rsquo; girl,  no friends &rsquo;as she&rdquo;, but his old spirit was lacking.</p>
<p>Chiller left. In two months,  Minnie left. One Monday morning about a year later. Feathers said to Benno, the  clerk:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;d yeh think I seen, Sundee?  Th&rsquo; Bantam &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;er nibs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Spadger&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as. They &rsquo;ad er pramberlater.  There was er pincher in it. Chiller was pushin&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough for &rsquo;im&rdquo;, said the  relentless Benno.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ThePackersLittleSilly"></a>The Packer&rsquo;s &ldquo;Little Silly&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Mr. George Mills,  packer, was not wholly impervious to the arrows of the little love god. He had  not served, for twelve years or more, on the top flat at Spats&rsquo;, with girls of  all ages, all sorts and sizes, and every make and shape, gathered about him,  without sustaining wounds. But Feathers was a philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er man learns a bit &rsquo;bout women  in a crib like this,&rdquo; he said, ruminating over a quid, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; the more he learns,  the more he puts his confidence in beer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody had ever seen the packer  drunk, but he had a deep, abiding affection for beer, and with the affection  was coupled a large respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these cheap &rsquo;n&rsquo; easy  shickers rollin&rsquo; round on their ear what brings discredit on beer. &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t the  liquor wot&rsquo;s snide, it&rsquo;s the dead hookity hides what it gets chuted into, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  the grown bloke ez kin take his little lot in bond, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then go &rsquo;ome on his own  end &rsquo;ithout wakin&rsquo; the town, &rsquo;s got a friend in beer more lovin&rsquo; than mother.  Jimmy Jee! how&rsquo;d a man get bumped with worldly trubs if he &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t beer t&rsquo; fall  back on! &rsquo;Ow&rsquo;d I iv bin many a time if &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t fer the drop iv buck-up? I&rsquo;ve  seen me put all my bits on a little silly more&rsquo;n once &rsquo;r twice, &rsquo;n&rsquo; played fer  keeps too&mdash;took the teetotal fer &rsquo;er sake, &rsquo;n&rsquo; was mother&rsquo;s bes&rsquo; boy fer ez much  ez a month, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then &rsquo;ad t&rsquo; get back et the pints agin fer consolation. Now I  wouldn&rsquo;t turn it down fer the toffest Dolly on the block.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;little silly&rdquo; Mills had more  particularly in his mind when moralizing thus was Connie Gleeson, an expert  paster from a rival establishment. Miss Gleeson was a revelation to Spats&rsquo;  Beauties&mdash;tall and fair, with large blue eyes, abundant hair, an excellent  complexion, and a decent figure. Sitting quite still, in a plain black dress,  with her mouth shut, Connie was a passable imitation of a lady, but the  illusion vanished the moment she opened her ruby lips. Feathers was well  pleased with her; so was Benno, and, for the matter of that, so was Billy the  Boy, in whom familiarity with the Beauties had bred a quaint precocity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Jimmy! you kin tread on me  face, whoever y&rsquo; are,&rdquo; said the small devil, when he first confronted Miss  Gleeson. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the prize bloom, Sis. Where&rsquo;d they get yeh? Look &rsquo;ere, if you  ain&rsquo;t runnin&rsquo; a bes&rsquo; boy iv yer own would y&rsquo; min&rsquo; givin&rsquo; me a little kiss&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheeky boy,&rdquo; said Miss Gleeson.  &ldquo;Get goin&rsquo; &rsquo;r I&rsquo;ll hit y&rsquo; in the squint.&rdquo; She threatened him pleasantly with  her brush.</p>
<p>Billy the Boy stood back for a better  view. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a bonzer like you doin&rsquo; spreadin&rsquo; sour paste fer yer daily?&rdquo; said  the wise child. &ldquo;You outer be in the sixp&rsquo;ny bar, spangled with di&rsquo;monds,  dishin&rsquo; up drinks t&rsquo; lots iv squatters.&rdquo; To Billy&rsquo;s young idea, a barmaid&rsquo;s  position in a sixpenny bar was the ultimate height in the way of social  elevation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;s that&rdquo; exclaimed Miss  Gleeson, struck with the idea. &ldquo;D&rsquo;yeh think I&rsquo;d do fer a barmaid&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I what? Take it from the  teller, you&rsquo;d slap the town. You&rsquo;d have firs&rsquo; pull ermong the doods, &rsquo;n&rsquo; cud  pick one t&rsquo; suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers came softly behind the  printer&rsquo;s devil, took him by the ear, led him to the top of the stairs, and  prompted him with a kick. Billy went down. The packer already had other views  for Miss Gleeson, and he did not like the turn the conversation had taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar-rt!&rdquo; cried Connie. &ldquo;Le&rsquo; the  boy be. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a fair treat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy&rsquo;s head bobbed up the stairs  again. &ldquo;&rsquo;Andle him tender, Sis,&rdquo; he piped, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble t&rsquo; boils. That what yeh  notice &rsquo;bout &rsquo;im&rsquo;s free-lunch onyins. Cud chip it with a chisel, cudn&rsquo;t yeh&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer&rsquo;s usual weapon, the  twine ball, missed, and knocked in the belltopper of the junior partner in the  cellar below. Billy the Boy was absent from the subsequent explanations. He was  very happy. Later in the day he presented Miss Gleeson with a caricature of the  packer in three inks. Bill&rsquo;s caricatures were always atrociously broad, and yet  held some strange, loathly resemblance to the victim that made them a joy to  everybody else.</p>
<p>Feathers&rsquo; love for Connie Gleeson  was a sudden infection. In the words of Benno, he took it &ldquo;ez the kitten took  the brick.&rdquo; Miss Twentyman introduced the stranger with grave formalities, and  the packer was glad he had kept his collar on that morning, and pleased that  his well-oiled hair was truly parted, and that the branching arabesques on his  forehead were as accurate as a printer&rsquo;s bracket. These reflections flowed in  upon him, despite the fact that it was &ldquo;a fair knock-out.&rdquo; Connie had large  eyes, into which she could infuse at will a touching shyness quite infantile.  She rolled them at Mills, and she smiled at him through moist, red lips. She  had a trick of moistening her lips when she wished to be particularly  bewitching. Feathers was stunned. Ten minutes later Benno found him, fifty  two-pound fruit bags in his inert hands, his jaws suspended, and his unseeing  eyes fixed on the whitewashed wall beyond his packing-board, dead to the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ello! &rsquo;ello, there!&rdquo; cried the  clerk, dropping a fourteen pound weight on the scales. &ldquo;Get a move on, &rsquo;r you&rsquo;ll  get the shoot. Hoggy&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; up with his gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer sprung into action as  if a button had been touched. &ldquo;Hev y&rsquo; taken er inven&rsquo;try iv the new goods&rdquo; he  said presently, finding it was a false alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-ho!&rdquo; said the little clerk,  giving his lapels a tug. &ldquo;Have I not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she&rdquo; commented Mills, with  something like enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is, &rsquo;n&rsquo; more,&rdquo; replied Benno.  &ldquo;Me &rsquo;n&rsquo; me worldly goods &rsquo;re all hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity t&rsquo; waste yeh!&rdquo; sneered  Feathers.</p>
<p>Miss Gleeson discovered herself  to be the object of interest, and moistened her lips, dropped her face, and  smiled up shyly at them through her nimbus of fair hair. It was a very pretty  action, and most effective, but it drew a long, moaning sound from Harrerbeller  Harte, followed by a lot of irrelevant baby-talk, addressed to nobody and  nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oo&rsquo;s mummy&rsquo;s ickle sly-boots, oo  is&mdash;oo is! Baby&rsquo;s a baddy baddy &rsquo;icky bubb-bubb to goo-goo the wicked mans!&rdquo; said  the lank and homely Miss Harte, and she kept at it till Feathers got angry and  advised her to get back to the madhouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s in the fam&rsquo;ily,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; orter be seen to. How d&rsquo; we know y&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t dangerous&rdquo;</p>
<p>For answer Harrerbeller gave a  grotesque parody of Miss Gleeson&rsquo;s timid droop and moist, shy smile that set  half the pasters squealing. Already the Beauties had decided that Connie was  &ldquo;as ratty as rabbits,&rdquo; and their hasty judgment was confirmed by wider  experience, although no man in the house could be brought to admit that there  was anything the matter with Connie beyond an excess of girlish sweetness.</p>
<p>It is a foolish girl indeed who  has not some kind of an eye to the main chance in her dealings with man, and it  is not likely that Connie regarded Feathers as her main chance at any time.  There is no doubt, however, that the packer was very serious. After the first  month he gave up beer and other little self indulgences, in order to have it in  his power to shout the young lady to 2s. seats at the Royal, and to suppers of  fried whiting, chips, and coffee at the fish-shops. Feathers was not a demonstrative  lover, but his affection for Miss Gleeson was soon common knowledge. He built a  stack of sugar-bags near her board as a cover for little flirtations, and if  anybody in authority came to the flat while he was making himself sweet with  the paster, he adroitly shifted his interest, and was found to be busy at that  stack, either taking parcels off or building them on.</p>
<p>Benno brought to Goudy the news  that Mills had been seen at large in a flogger coat, and wearing a turn-over  collar five inches high, and a little bow tie of tender pink. The facts were  communicated in George&rsquo;s hearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike me, you&rsquo;d iv thought it  had ten thousan&rsquo; er year from aunty t&rsquo; do what it liked with,&rdquo; said Benno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little pink bow tie,&rdquo; said the  town traveller, with exaggerated interest. &ldquo;How coy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N a new grey felt &rsquo;at tucked in  by mother,&rdquo; said Benno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a pure white collar and a  clean shave,&rdquo; added Goudy. &ldquo;It must have looked like &lsquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Prayer.&rsquo; How  did the women seem to bear up, poor things&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers arranged fourteen pound  of sugar bags with great attention to detail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ve gotter overlook it.&rdquo;  Benno went on. &ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t responsible. It&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; a dote on a little silly, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  it&rsquo;s took t&rsquo; walkin&rsquo; in its sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Takes her to sixpenny shows, and  shouts cough drops,&rdquo; said the town traveller. &ldquo;The man&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers began to soliloquise  aloud. &ldquo;Once knew a Scotchman give an ounce iv liver t&rsquo; bribe a tom cat, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  then, after frettin&rsquo; erbout it fer a month, he ate the cat t&rsquo; get his own  back.&rdquo; Then, discovering Goudy and the clerk, he said pleasantly: &ldquo;&rsquo;Ello! is  that you? Thort it was the cockroaches.&rdquo; Taking up his parcel, the packer  crossed to Connie&rsquo;s board, and held playful conversation with the paster merely  to demonstrate his superiority to criticism. While his back was turned, the  town traveller filled his drawer with dodgers and cuttings from furnishing  warehousemen&rsquo;s advertisements, all addressed to those about to marry, and all  undertaking to furnish a home for two at a cost the ridiculous smallness of which  absolutely filled the advertisers with amazement. Later, Goudy led Miss Gleeson  to the packer&rsquo;s bench, and, pulling out the drawer, revealed to her the many  cuttings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep at him, my girl. You&rsquo;ve got  him thinking,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yar, go&rsquo;n chase yerself, why don&rsquo;t  yeh&rdquo; said Miss Gleeson, pleasantly confused. Then, as a bright afterthought,  she added, &ldquo;Yer fair up the pole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mills had become very spruce  these mornings. He shaved every day. He wore white collars and gay ties at his  bench, and kept a bit of broken mirror in the lift corner, to which he repaired  several times a day to refresh himself and re-arrange his hair. Billy the Boy  noticed these things, and commented on them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s bin mendin&rsquo; his hair agin,  Sis,&rdquo; said the small boy. &ldquo;He parts it with a plumb-bob. I say, ain&rsquo;t he one  fer keepin&rsquo; hisself clean? I ain&rsquo;t bin able t&rsquo; rekernize him lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy lurked behind stacks of  bales, with his retreat always open. The packer placed a hard twine ball handy,  and trusted in Providence.  Billy the Boy resented the packer&rsquo;s courtship of Connie. He thought she should  aim higher, and he brought her affectionate messages, mostly mythical, from  superior persons in the warehouse. Billy&rsquo;s messages from the junior partner  once removed, &ldquo;Our Mr. Duff,&rdquo; were particularly ardent. Miss Gleeson was  inclined to think there was something in them, but everybody else knew them to  be preposterous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suety&rsquo;s bin tellin&rsquo;me he&rsquo;s seen  nothin&rsquo; t&rsquo; touch yeh &rsquo;tween here &rsquo;n&rsquo; world&rsquo;s end, Sis,&rdquo; said Billy, soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on, get off me face,&rdquo;  answered Connie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sez yer a knock-out, &rsquo;n&rsquo; if  anyone &rsquo;ud poison his wife he&rsquo;d be on&rsquo;y too &rsquo;appy t&rsquo; track with yeh. He sez  yer &rsquo;air&rsquo;s the goldenest he knows, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you&rsquo;ve got a neye like a tram lamp, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  &rsquo;ere are yow dodgin&rsquo; round with a waster like Feathers, what gets a matter iv  three bob a day, &rsquo;n&rsquo; couldn&rsquo;t afford t&rsquo; keep white mice after he&rsquo;s paid fer the  brilliantine what he glues his &rsquo;air with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge the amazement of the  factory when one afternoon Mr. Duff, the junior partner once removed, approached  Connie Gleeson&rsquo;s board, and, under a thin and miserable pretence of examining  her work, entered into serious conversation, which soon developed a flippancy  of which his wife would certainly not have approved. Connie was greatly  flustered and flattered. Her moist, red lips, her large, infantile eye, and her  girlish airs were all overworked in a distressing way. A strange silence fell  upon the Beauties. Feathers worked stolidly. His back betrayed nothing, but it  would have pleased him to have been in a position to command a special  thunderbolt for the junior partner that day.</p>
<p>In the course of a week Mr. Duff  came twenty times to the factory flat and he never left without exchanging a  little airy badinage with Miss Gleeson. On each succeeding occasion the conversation  was a little more familiar, and Connie moistened her lips, giggled ingenuously,  and, glancing up through her hair, said again and again: &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Duff, you are  a one!&rdquo; Feathers grew murderous. Harrerbeller Harte&rsquo;s little burlesques of the  meetings convulsed the factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Popsey-wopsey mustn&rsquo;t play with  the wicked gentleman,&rdquo; cautioned Harrerbeller. &ldquo;Wicked gentleman steal mummy&rsquo;s  ickle sweetie away, and then bub cry her pretty blue eyes out, she will.  Popsey&rsquo;s a teeny weeny sillikin; nice gentleman eat her all up!&rdquo; In concluding,  Harrerbeller aped a cow-like coquetry, and squealed with affected rapture: &ldquo;Oh,  Mr. Duff, you are a one!&rdquo; And then the Beauties gave the chorus: &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Duff,  you are a one!&rdquo; But Connie was not distressed by this by-play. She merely  giggled, and wriggled, and rolled her blue eyes, and said, mincingly, with her  most ladylike air: &ldquo;Stop it off, y&rsquo; lot iv wasters. I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave him on me  mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers was the real sufferer.  In his own language, he was &ldquo;off the Dolly.&rdquo; Connie passed his bench now with  her mouth pursed, her nose up, and her eyes half-closed, usually trilling a  popular tune with a most elaborate assumption of preoccupation. The packer gave  no sign, but his soul was a seething geyser of emotion, waiting for a chance to  spout.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant afternoon. The  sunshine poured in through the western windows, and a droning calmness was upon  the factory. Mills packed steadily, apparently unconscious of everything but  duty, really alert from his ear-tips to his ankles. Benno came to him from the  lift end, touched him on the shoulder, winked three times, and jerked his thumb  in the direction of the stacks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get back t&rsquo; yer barrel!&rdquo; said  Feathers, with concentrated vindictiveness.</p>
<p>As if Feathers did not know that  the junior partner had just met Connie as she was coming back from the boilers,  and that round the turn of the room a flighty flirtation was going on. The  packer could hear the sound of playful slapping, and Connie&rsquo;s irritating titter  scalded his ears. The two were under cover of a high stack of hat bags in  parcels of five hundred, built twelve on, and almost reaching the roof. Hat  bags are extremely light, the whole stack would not weigh anything  considerable, and it had caved, and had a big list. It overhung the philanderer  and Miss Gleeson like the Leaning Tower of Pisa.</p>
<p>Billy the Boy came up the stairs  on a special mission.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mister Duff &rsquo;ere&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;His  missus wants him pertickler.&rdquo; Billy looked back. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; up,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>A blinding inspiration struck  Mills. He ceased packing. His vengeance was at hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Comin&rsquo; up, is she&rdquo; He looked  over the stair, and lied calmly. &ldquo;Suety&rsquo;s jist gone down t&rsquo; the printer&rsquo;s flat.  Get after him on the front stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy fled, and Feathers looked  over the balusters again. He wished to time his little tableau precisely. There  came to his mind rumors of Mr. Duff&rsquo;s domestic infelicities. He had heard Mrs.  Duff referred to as &ldquo;the Duchess.&rdquo; She was large and stout, and she had  followed her husband to the top flat on previous occasions.</p>
<p>The packer bent over a few reams  of confectionery paper by the stack of hat bags. His shoulder was against the  stack. He lifted deliberately, and with a great heave, and slowly, silently,  like a snow-drift, over went the stack, burying Connie and the junior partner  in an avalanche of bags. One shrill scream from Connie, and for a moment all  was still. Then there was a clamorous rush of Beauties. Mrs. Duff and Feathers  were first upon the scene of the disaster. Feathers was particularly careful  that Mrs. Duff should have a front place and a full view.</p>
<p>On the floor lay a mound of hat  bags. Nothing of humanity was visible. Feathers set to work, hurling the  parcels aside. He worked with energy, but wisely too, and presently a pair of  boots came into view. They were the junior partner&rsquo;s. Mrs. Duff recognised them  with an ejaculation of terror. Feathers tossed aside a dozen more bundles, and  another pair of boots and ankles were revealed. They were Connie Gleeson&rsquo;s.  Mrs. Duff uttered a second ejaculation, but this time it was not terror that  impelled it. Feathers grinned inwardly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a jig on, can&rsquo;t yeh&rdquo; he  cried, and the dumbfounded pasters fell upon the bundles.</p>
<p>A minute later Mr. Duff struggled  up out of the wreckage, and shook himself. He was unhurt, and seemed rather  amused. The next moment Connie was pulled from under, and she, too, stood  erect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, that was a queer  experience,&rdquo; cried Mr. Duff. &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not hurt, my dear.&rdquo; Then he  discovered his wife, and caught her awful eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t faint,&rdquo; said Feathers  to Goudy next morning. &ldquo;&rsquo;E didn&rsquo;t scream. &rsquo;E jist faded away. &rsquo;E turned the  tint iv a young Chow, &rsquo;n&rsquo; the smile went dead on his face, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he was struck  that way. His wife took a firm &rsquo;n&rsquo; masterly grip iv his arm, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she said: &lsquo;Come,  Mister Duff! Come, Mister Duff!&rsquo; That was all, but y&rsquo; ortiv &rsquo;eard it. S&rsquo;elp me,  Jimmy Jee, &rsquo;twas like a sentence iv death! I watched &rsquo;em down stairs. She never  eased her grip iv him all the way. I don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;s let go yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mighty curious how that stack  came to topple over just then,&rdquo; said the town traveller, scratching his lip in  a troubled way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the packer. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas  what the papers call a dispensation iv Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following Saturday was  Connie&rsquo;s last day at the factory. A fortnight later Billy the Boy had news of  her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gleeson took the tip from one  what knows, after all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s in a bar up town. A sixpenny bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My troubs!&rdquo; answered the packer.  He was unshaven, uncollared, and disreputable, and there was a taint of beer in  his atmosphere, but, all the same, when Billy had gone, he heaved a great sigh.  She was indeed lost to him, for to Feathers a sixpenny bar seemed as remote as  the North Pole, and not more desirable of attainment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ASaturdayatSpats"></a>A Saturday at Spats&rsquo;</h2>
<p>There was&nbsp;a sort  of dress parade on the top flat at Spats&rsquo; every Saturday. On ordinary days the  Beauties came in their second best, which was changed on the premises for  paste-stiffened skirts and bedraggled blouses, any old thing being considered  good enough to work in. But on Saturday the pasters and folders sported their  glad rags, forgetting nothing that would impress their enemies; and in the  bitter rivalry of dress there were no friendships. On this day the new hat was  flashed upon the factory like a smack in the face, the unexpected frock shocked  the Beauties with its insolent beauty, the nine-carat brooch or the glittering  ring, set profusely with precious stones, &ldquo;quite as good as diamonds&rdquo;, was  displayed for the first time with a disregard for the feelings of others that  was simply vindictive. Every girl did her utmost on Saturday, and, excepting in  a few special cases, always with the fear that her best possible would be  out-done by a special effort on the part of some more fortunate sister.</p>
<p>On this particular Saturday  morning Kitty Coudray had no misgivings. She was wearing the whole of her new  summer&rsquo;s goods for the first time, and went up the front stairs, so that she  might have to walk the length of the flat to the dressing-room. Every woman in  an astonishing frock is at heart a stage-manager. Kitty&rsquo;s entrance was a great  success, her march down the stage a triumph. She was radiant in blue and white  muslin, and a saucy little black hat with white lace and feathers. The girls  who had gone before sighed over their little faded glories, and meekly  abandoned all pretensions for the time being.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my, what a turn you&rsquo;ve give  me!&rdquo; cried the clerk, having fallen off his stool in blind wonder.</p>
<p>Benno&rsquo;s amazement, if facetious,  was flattering, and Kitty smiled on him very sweetly.</p>
<p>The packer barred her way. &ldquo;Break  it t&rsquo; me gently,&rdquo; he said in an awed voice. &ldquo;Have y&rsquo; killed yer rich old uncle  &rsquo;r embezzled ther fam&rsquo;ly di&rsquo;monds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty blushingly insisted that it  was only a simple bit of a dress for second best&mdash;nothing to speak of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer er fair blaze iv glory,&rdquo;  Mills continued. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; kin do what y&rsquo; like with me. I&rsquo;m done. I&rsquo;ll never get over  this, I know.&rdquo; He was walking round her, humbly inspecting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah-h-h,&rdquo; cried a derisive voice  from a distant board, &ldquo;stick &rsquo;er in the bloomin&rsquo; winder, &rsquo;n&rsquo; give ther town er  charnce!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kitty stiffened at once, her nose  went up, and she walked on with an increase of dignity, but not really  displeased. That cry had come from a stricken soul. It was really a tribute.  She would not have been wholly satisfied had the girls taken it all quite  kindly.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army lass at the  machine began to sing a plaintive little hymn. The Army had had a revival in  the cheap suburbs lately, and had been getting in some good work amongst the  factory hands. There were two or three converts in the room. They joined in the  hymn. It was the protest of the saints against the vanities of the flesh.  Spotty Corbet, the machinist, was intensely &ldquo;saved&rdquo;. She came to work in shabby  regimentals, and spoke a three minutes&rsquo; grace over a &ldquo;crib&rdquo; of bread and jam  that it took her two minutes to eat. She was a squat, sallow girl of about  sixteen, sullen and slovenly, and had a guilty secret. When not observed, she  oiled her greasy dark hair with the machine lubricators.</p>
<p>Kitty Coudray had changed and  taken her place at the board, when Billy the Boy charged upstairs crimson with  information.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wipe yer nose &rsquo;n&rsquo; pull down yer  pinny, Mills,&rdquo; gasped the devil, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s her Excellency makin&rsquo; er mornin&rsquo;  call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up the stairs came a faint frou-frou.  Feathers cocked his ear. There was no mistaking it. It was the musical rattle  of silk. The packer ventured to look over the rail. He blew a long, faint  whistle, expressive of profound emotion. He beckoned to Goudy in the manner of  a man bereft of speech. There was an apprehensive hush, and the sibilant call  of a silk underskirt stole through the factory. All eyes turned to the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done yer dash,&rdquo; cried  Billy, addressing the Beauties. &ldquo;You kin all git orf ther earth. Twentyman&rsquo;s  got yeh beat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Jee!&rdquo; whispered Mills.  &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Bland &rsquo;Olt&rsquo;s wicked woman straight from ther halls of gilded vice, with  all her clobber on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers and the town traveller  stood back reverently, giving the newcomer a clear stage, and as Sis Twentyman  stepped on to the flat the silence of the factory broke in a long gasp. Nothing  like this had ever before been seen at Spats&rsquo;. The most riotous imagination  there had never dreamed of such magnificence in a mere &ldquo;fact&rsquo;ry &rsquo;and&rdquo;. Sis was  profusely clad in pink silk, billows and billows of it, trimmed with cream  lace, and she wore a great black picture hat foaming with feathers, and new  glazed shoes with steel buckles. Kitty Coudray, her brush clutched in her  frozen hand, gazed at this overwhelming spectacle, her eyes wide, her mouth  gaping, transfixed. It was a form of paralysis, and she did not recover  consciousness for three minutes.</p>
<p>Sis remained talking with  Feathers. It was his duty to keep a record of late arrivals, who were fined  according to the length of their transgression. Miss Twentyman made a pretty  show of excusing herself, but her late arrival was premeditated malice and  Feathers understood the situation. Sis was not merely completing her  triumph&mdash;she was &ldquo;rubbing it in&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won thirty thousan&rsquo; quid in  Tatt&rsquo;s, &rsquo;aven&rsquo;t yeh?&rdquo; said the packer, affecting the meekness of the poor and  lowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had let us know you were  coming we&rsquo;d have had the stair carpet down and the walls decorated,&rdquo; said the  town-traveller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse yourself, Mister Cloudy,&rdquo;  replied Sis, with a ladylike air of hauteur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;re yeh ruinin&rsquo;, Sis?&rdquo; asked  Feathers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so familiar, Mister Mills,  please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sis gathered up her profuse skirt  and swept away, and half a dozen of the Beauties, driven from their usual  refuge of seeming indifference by such splendour, forsook their work, and  clattered after her, shrill with admiration. After these went the anguished  foreman, with his feeble but insistent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come! Come, come, there.  What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls buzzed about Sis, deaf  to Fuzzy&rsquo;s orders and his threats, and Spotty Corbet drove her machine  fiercely, and piped her hymn of protest once more.</p>
<p>Mills aired his philosophy of  clothes to Goudy. &ldquo;Take it from the man under the bed, Spotty, wimmin&rsquo;s mostly  clothes, an&rsquo; ther rest rings an&rsquo; things. Man&rsquo;s what he drinks; woman&rsquo;s what she  wears. Size up this bunch. On ther ordin&rsquo;ry mornin&rsquo;s in their secon&rsquo; best  baggin&rsquo;, they&rsquo;re sort iv subdood &rsquo;n&rsquo; moderate perlite, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you don&rsquo;t see &rsquo;em  buckin&rsquo; up, or playin&rsquo; ther frivolous ox. Look at ther difference when they get  inter ther rags. Then they gets down to it&mdash;they&rsquo;re cobbers with ther rats; &rsquo;n&rsquo;  yer needn&rsquo;t put much apast &rsquo;em. But watch out fer Saturdees when ther latest  season&rsquo;s goods is out fer the air; &rsquo;n&rsquo; they&rsquo;re ther real pink, &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer mustn&rsquo;t  touch &rsquo;em with er prop if yer don&rsquo;t wanter get it cold. Blime, y&rsquo;d think Spats&rsquo;  was er select seminary fer young lydies iv gentle birth, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that ther dorters  iv ther aristocracy here t&rsquo; get made fit in French, dancin&rsquo;, haccomplishments,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; perlite conversation. Mop up what&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; when Twentyman comes along in her  old stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sis came again, dressed for  work, and carying her tub of paste, the packer said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me shicker, Twenty, you  was the on&rsquo;y pebble. Flemin&rsquo;ton on Cup Day!&mdash;don&rsquo; mention. Ther Mayor&rsquo;s ball!&mdash;a  blessed marine store. Lovely, y&rsquo; was, straight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar&rsquo;n! Le&rsquo; go me leg!&rdquo; retorted  Miss Twentyman, saucily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell yeh?&rdquo; said Mills  to Goudy.</p>
<p>The Beauties got down to work  slowly and reluctantly that morning. There was a still later arrival. Bell  Olliver came in quite half an hour behind time, wearing a new blue blouse, a  blouse that would have created some little stir on ordinary occasions, but  which was received with absolute indifference, coming after the extravagance of  Kitty and the magnificence of Sis.</p>
<p>Bell came by the front stairs, radiant with expectation, smiling a  self-conscious smile, and blushing brightly. By the time she reached the  packer&rsquo;s board the smile had fled, and Bell&rsquo;s  face had assumed the colour of old dough. She turned down the wing to the  dressing-rooms, and as she did not re-appear in the course of a quarter of an  hour, the foreman went ambling down the flat, full of zeal, and tripping over  his own feet every few yards as usual, in the agonies preceding an encounter  with a Beauty of Bell&rsquo;s argumentative power and uncertain temper.</p>
<p>Fuzzy found Miss Oliver seated  behind a stack of straw-boards, wearing her drab working apparel, her little  tub of paste between her feet, weeping like a wet day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; he cried, with  tremulous valour. &ldquo;Come, come! Out o&rsquo; this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar&rsquo;n scratch!&rdquo; retorted the  young lady, drearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? What&rsquo;s this? This  won&rsquo;t do, you know. Get to work, &rsquo;r I&rsquo;ll fine you a shillin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Olliver jumped up and  confronted Fuzzy, suddenly ablaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tork t&rsquo; me!&rdquo; she screamed.  &ldquo;You, &rsquo;r fat old Pig&rsquo;s Whiskers downstairs, &rsquo;r any iv yer rats. Do it! Tork t&rsquo;  me, monkey face, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman recognized the  symptoms. He retreated precipitately, but Miss Olliver&rsquo;s tub of paste took him  between the shoulders as he fled, and made his back view absurd for the rest of  the day. Saturday morning was a trying time for Fuzzy in many ways.</p>
<p>Bell came to her board when it pleased her. She was an expert paster,  and rival firms would have been glad of her services. Fuzzy had to rule her and  many like her by a system of judicious submission. For three hours order and  industry prevailed on the flat. Bell  was in a fit of black sulks; Kitty Coudray was sour and insolent; the other  girls had a thoughtful and depressed air. Sis Twentyman alone was gay. She was  particularly affectionate towards Kitty, and seemed quite stupidly blind and  deaf to Miss Coudray&rsquo;s coldness and contempt.</p>
<p>Naturally Sis Twentyman was the  first in the dressing-room at knock-off time. Her arrival there was signalled  by a series of shrieks that stirred the establishment to its lowest depths,  galvanized the factory, and brought the printers streaming upstairs. Shrieking  was not uncommon on the top flat, but never had such poignant yells pierced its  walls. Sis performed like a woman in mortal agony. Feathers, heading the rush,  discovered her standing in her petticoats, holding the pink silk skirt out  before her, and screaming with all her energies in a stupid, blind, settled way  suggestive of madness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Struth, Twenty, what bit yeh?&rdquo;  gasped Mills. He shook her as if expecting to rearrange a disorganized  apparatus. &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;take er grip on yerself if yeh ain&rsquo;t fair  off yer almond.&rdquo; But Sis only screamed again, and shook the pink silk skirt,  and now the situation became comprehensible. The skirt was an utter ruin; it  was torn this way and that, and the frills and the lace hung from it in rags.</p>
<p>At this moment Sis Twentyman&rsquo;s  eyes fell upon Kitty Coudray, in whose face was something like a light of  elation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she shrieked.  &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;you-&rdquo; Her passion choked her on the suitable epithet, and she dashed  at Kitty with hooked claws, like a ravening lioness. But Feathers and Don clung  to the fury and averted manslaughter.</p>
<p>The light of elation had fled  suddenly from the eyes of Kitty Coudray. It was succeeded by a poignant  apprehension. She darted into the dressing-room, and the next moment her cries  added to the general confusion. She came forth carrying her new blue skirt. It  was split from waistband to hem, six or seven times and was a hopeless wreck.  Kitty glared at Sis in dumb rage for a moment, and all a woman could possibly  feel of spite and anguish was in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She did it!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;She did  it, the devil!&rdquo; and it took two printers to keep her from Sis Twentyrnan. The  Salvation girl was singing &ldquo;Sound the loud timbrel o&rsquo;er Egypt&rsquo;s dark  sea, Jehovah hath triumphed, His people are free.&rdquo; Spats himself and other  authorities had arrived on the scene, but their influence was as nothing in the  face of a catastrophe like this. The Beauties swarmed: their indignation was  virtuous but virulent. They cried aloud for vengeance on the destroyer. A rush  for the dressing-room revealed the fact that no further damage had been done,  and slowly the factory simmered down. Sis and Kitty, surrounded by guards, sat  apart, and sorrowed over their tattered garments, soaking themselves in tears.</p>
<p>It was Feathers suggested the  cat: &ldquo;Ther Tutsie&rsquo;s erbout arf ez big ez er bar&rsquo;l,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; when he gets  out after himself in high pressure hysterics, he fair digs bricks outer ther  buildin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ve seen him kick ther hessian off er bale iv paper afore t&rsquo; day,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; he &rsquo;ad er fit this mornin&rsquo;. I &rsquo;eard him doin &rsquo;an&rsquo; springs &rsquo;n&rsquo; fizzin&rsquo; like  er soda factory back er ther lift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authorities retired to the  depths, and slowly the girls dressed and drifted downstairs. Sis and Kitty had  come together, mutually forgiving, as sisters in misfortune should be, and they  mingled their tears, pending the conclusion of a consultation being held in the  boss&rsquo;s office. Feathers brought the news. The foreman had gone under cover  behind his guillotines, overwhelmed by the catastrophe, and knowing that blame,  unplaceable elsewhere, invariably fell upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s rybuck, girls,&rdquo; said Feathers.  &ldquo;Yer on velvet. Ther firm&rsquo;s willin&rsquo; t&rsquo; accept responsibility fer ther actions  iv it&rsquo;s dooly accredited cat, &rsquo;n&rsquo; pays compensation. Yer on&rsquo;y &rsquo;ave t&rsquo; put in a  claim fer damages &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther quids is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sis and Kitty brightened up  wonderfully at this, but not sufficiently to imply that they had wholly parted  with their grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spats has sent fer er &rsquo;ansom,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; yer to be wheeled &rsquo;ome et ther firm&rsquo;s expense,&rdquo; continued Feathers. Then he  cried to Spotty Corbet, the Salvation girl, whom he had requested to stay,  pending orders, and who was stealing from behind the bales towards the stairs.  &ldquo;Yeh don&rsquo;t do er guy jes&rsquo; yet, Spot. This is where yer trouble comes. Back in  yer cart. I want ter chat yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl came slowly towards  them, lowering under her battered Army bonnet, her sallow face smeared with  tears and dust, her brief, shabby skirt falling short of its duty. She was an  absurd and pitiful figure. Feathers took her by the shoulder:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;cough it up.  Why&rsquo;d yeh tear them dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sis and Kitty sprang to their  feet, their eyes blazed, and they made at Spotty Corbet with bared talons.  &ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; cried the packer, &ldquo;keep good. Enough iv it.&rdquo; He put them back,  and addressed Spotty again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t hear y&rsquo; talkin&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Y&rsquo; know yeh tore  them skirts, y&rsquo; can&rsquo;t jolly me. Why&rsquo;d yeh do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Spotty dug a finger in her mouth,  and squirmed for a moment, and then her eyes gleamed and she stood erect for a  fine effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They was offensive in the sight  of the Lord!&rsquo; she said. Then she collapsed again, her finger went back into her  mouth, she began to cry, and kicking her old skirt out with her knee, she said  with stupid bitterness, &ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; mine is sich rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum,&rdquo; said Feathers,  philosophically, &ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d fitted yeh. Now do er bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer held the two pasters  while Spotty shuffled to the stairs, and went down, snivelling all the way. She  did not reappear at Spats&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t yer let me at her?&rdquo;  said Sis fiercely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d a&rsquo; scraped her bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn, Twenty, ain&rsquo;t yeh got er  bit of sav? Make a bustle with her &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;ave it orl over ther shop she done it,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther cat&rsquo;s been wrongly accused, &rsquo;n&rsquo; how does yer compensation come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o-o-o-!&rdquo; breathed Sis and  Kitty in chorus, very softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh-o-o-o!&rdquo; breathed the packer  in mockery, more softly still.</p>
<p>Feathers was a true diplomat, and  had a fine contempt for accuracy. &ldquo;&rsquo;Onesty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is the bust policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheFickleDollyHopgood"></a>The Fickle Dolly Hopgood</h2>
<p>Miss Dolly Hopgood&nbsp;was  commonly called &lsquo;Ginge&rsquo;, an abbreviation of Ginger, and a polite allusion to  her prevailing tint. She was a saucy young lady of about sixteen, and lived in  a push-ridden suburb. Her hair was worn turned in a hard pad all round her  head, so that from a little distance it looked very much as if she were wearing  the pneumatic cushion from Odgson&rsquo;s office chair, as a sort of halo.</p>
<p>The dress in which Miss Hopgood  came to business was of light-coloured, limp material, ribbed with cheap black  lace, like the hoops on a barrel. Her hat was a wide-rimmed &lsquo;gem&rsquo;, skewered so  far forward that in her walks it preceded her by about half a yard; the  high-heeled boots she affected accentuated the apparent precipitation of  Dolly&rsquo;s top-hamper.</p>
<p>Dolly was a plump and cheerful  rapscallion, but her face had a certain granite quality characteristic of the  daughters of slum families&mdash;a quality devised by an all-wise Providence, no  doubt, as a provision against injury in contact with the bluchers of husbands  and lovers, the ardour of whose affection, when accelerated by beer, is apt to  express itself in kicks.</p>
<p>On the first appearance of Miss  Hopgood the packer greeted her with breezy familiarity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow is it, Sis?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Here,  ain&rsquo;t I seen you proppin&rsquo; the door at Crilly&rsquo;s Assembly Toosday nights?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benno grinned approvingly.  &ldquo;Strike me, Feathers, you&rsquo;ve fitted her in one!&rdquo; he chortled.</p>
<p>Ginge certainly did suggest a  larrikin hop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gart! git back t&rsquo;yer lorndry!&rdquo;  retorted the young lady. The remark conveyed a playful insinuation that  Feathers and the clerk were of ignominious Asiatic origin.</p>
<p>There was usually some little diffidence  about novitiates on the factory flat, but Miss Hopgood betrayed not the  smallest concern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yow, there, Tilly! Scratchin&rsquo; a  livin&rsquo; &rsquo;ere, are yeh?&rdquo; she cried shrilly, shaking her crib basket at a distant  paster. The ex-professional fat girl caught her eye. Miss Pilcher was wearing a  superior expression. Ginge raised her hand, and wagged playful fingers at  Martha. &ldquo;Buck up, puds,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re all right. They&rsquo;re payin&rsquo; quids a  bar&rsquo;l fer your sort at Stonkie Watson&rsquo;s.&rdquo; Watson&rsquo;s was the soap-boiling  establishment that gave rank to a river-side suburb. The fat girl resented the  insinuation with a loathly sneer, and Ginge passed by in triumph.</p>
<p>Ginge Hopgood was just as gaily  impertinent with the comps and machine hands on the printers&rsquo; flat, and hailed  them from the stairs with frank familiarity. Clinker Gill, one of the freeders,  was Sophie Oddie&rsquo;s boy, but Miss Hopgood assumed possession without a trace of  compunction. Clinker, greatly flattered to find himself the chief object of her  somewhat personal back-street flippancies, succumbed instantly, and Sophie  ceased to be an item in his daily life.</p>
<p>Possibly Clinker lived to repent  his perfidy. Sometimes he might have looked as if he did, but he never admitted  it. Master Gill was about seventeen, a round-headed lad with closely-mown black  hair, and a countenance the utter commonplaceness of which beggared criticism.  On the morning of the fifth day after Miss Hopgood&rsquo;s arrival, Clinker came to  work with a damaged eye, and all day his manner was subdued, not to say  penitent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d it &rsquo;appen, Ned?&rdquo; asked  Feathers, when Gill came up with a bundle of printed tea papers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit iv a dust-up with a bloke  down ar way,&rdquo; said Clinker.</p>
<p>Feathers had all a woman&rsquo;s  curiosity about details.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose th&rsquo; other lad won&rsquo;t be leavin&rsquo;  his bed this side Christmas?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I dunno.&rdquo; Clinker was  becomingly modest. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; much wrong with him, barrin&rsquo; two teeth  out &rsquo;n&rsquo; a thick ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us the strength iv it, Ned.  Did yeh hand him the pass out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinker Gill grew confidential.  His opponent was a rival claimant for Ginge&rsquo;s favours. Miss Hopgood had had  another boy for some months, a boy who was prepared to assert his prior rights  on the gory battlefield, and who had already done so on two occasions, to  Clinker&rsquo;s great discomfort. The claimant&rsquo;s name was Holland. He was a stiff-built youth, with  large freckles and a fair down all over his face. Also, he was an impetuous and  unscrupulous fighter, and lurked at corners to intercept Clinker and Dolly,  charging down upon the former, and commencing hostilities without fair and  sufficient warning.</p>
<p>In the course of the following  fortnight Clinker had four scraps with Tommy Holland&mdash;wholly unsatisfactory  Street &lsquo;scrims&rsquo; that were interrupted by the appearance of a John, or the  intervention of some benevolently-disposed old lady or gentleman; but the  feeder always sustained more or less damage, and he burned to fight a  conclusive engagement with his hated rival.</p>
<p>Apparently there was no peaceful  way of settling the matter in dispute, since Ginge could not be brought to see  that she was called upon to accept any responsibility. The girl would not give  a decision. She might walk home with Clinker in the evening but she would  stroll out with Tommy at night, and Gill was the occasion of a most unusual  pleasant Sunday afternoon in the Botanical Gardens. He had discovered Holland reposing by Miss  Hopgood on the sward. It took three gardeners and a whole revival meeting to  stop the fight.</p>
<p>Truth to tell, neither young  gentleman seemed to expect Dolly to express any partiality, but the packer  sometimes reproached her in a frivolous spirit. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t yeh announced yer choice  yet, Ginge?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;&rsquo;Strewth, if yeh can&rsquo;t make up yer mind which is the  prettiest, why not toss &rsquo;em for it&mdash;double or quits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me,&rdquo; said Dolly. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t  took on either of &rsquo;em fer keeps. I ain&rsquo;t one fer tyin&rsquo; meself down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this &rsquo;ere bloodshed is t&rsquo;  continue to the bitter end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My oath it is! While these  blokes is fightin&rsquo; each other they ain&rsquo;t fightin&rsquo; me&mdash;see?&rdquo; It was a specimen of  slum philosophy that tickled the packer immensely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Jee! You&rsquo;re a bird,&rdquo; he  said delightedly. &ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t know ain&rsquo;t in the books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinker Gill came to Feathers&rsquo;  board a few days after this, with an air of great importance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all fixed up, Mills,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried the packer, &ldquo;has  she given yeh brusher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinker wagged his round head  confidently. &ldquo;No blinded fear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ginge knows when she&rsquo;s got a good  thing. The fight&rsquo;s arranged &rsquo;tween me &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo; other bloke. We fight the prelim.  to the Bull Green &rsquo;n&rsquo; Coffee Hogan scrap et the Smithers Street Hathletic  Club&rsquo;s room on Monday night fortnight, catch-weights, fer harf-a-Jim &rsquo;n&rsquo; a  five-bob side wager&mdash;eight rounds, one t&rsquo; win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; ejaculated Feathers in  proud appreciation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Markis o&rsquo; Queensbee rules,  four-ounce gloves, &rsquo;n&rsquo; regerlation trunks. Prelimery starts punctual et eight;  prices two, one, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a tizzie. We&rsquo;ve both signed harticles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good e-nough,&rdquo; cried the packer.  &ldquo;I must &rsquo;ave a deener&rsquo;s worth iv that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the following fortnight  Clinker Gill was the hero of Spats&rsquo; factory. He trained industriously night and  morning, and at lunch time he boxed vigorously on a full stomach in the  lift-corner with any good friend who would oblige him with a generous hiding.</p>
<p>Clinker got punching enough in  twelve days to have made him indifferent to anything short of a mad bull-camel.  The bigger fellows nearly belted the head off him in the kindliest spirit  imaginable, believing they were doing him a great favour, and everybody offered  him advice and gave him useful hints to beginners, especially Benno the clerk.  Mr Dickson insisted with great wisdom on the necessity of keeping a straight  left. He committed himself no further, but he impressed that one point on Gill at  least twenty times a day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sticks my left into &rsquo;em,&rdquo; said  Benno. &ldquo;Never do nothin&rsquo; else, but jab &rsquo;em with a straight left ez they come  in, savin&rsquo; me right fer a finisher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dickson had never fought a  round in his life, but he was very impressive, and Clinker accepted his advice  with proper respect.</p>
<p>Master Gill bought a shilling  book on boxing, and started to learn it off by heart, from cover to cover, but  he was a poor study, and had only mastered about three chapters relating to  rules, training and attitudes, when the eventful night arrived.</p>
<p>The room of the Smithers Street  Athletic Club was over a threepenny hair-cut saloon in a cheap, crowded suburb.  It was a small, low, dark apartment, with a tiny ring in the centre, and just  space enough between the ropes and one wall for the high-priced patrons to  creep to the cramped gallery rising abruptly from the ringside to the roof. The  cheap &lsquo;sports&rsquo; were packed in a space twelve feet by twelve on the other side  of the roped enclosure, and a third set of supporters gathered on the roof on  the occasion of a really popular engagement, and looked on the warfare through  the broken shingles. In the course of the battle the proprietor of the  threepenny saloon went among these latter with a collection box, and any spectator  refusing to contribute was summarily chucked off. The chucking entailed a fall  of six feet to an adjoining roof.</p>
<p>Feathers, Benno, the Don and  several comps from the factory occupied seats in the shilling reserve, the top  half of the gallery close to the roof, where the smoke accumulated and the heat  of perdition assailed them. For it was a summer night, and the room was packed  as tight as it could hold with baking humanity, half of whom tugged at pipes  which sizzled like frying-pans and stank like future punishment. The other half  smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Benno took immediate steps to let  it be known that he was a personal friend of one of the boxers, and in all  probability had taught the lad all he knew, and then, finding nobody disposed  to bet on the preliminary, he offered five to four on Clinker Gill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five t&rsquo; four in quids,&rdquo; said the  clerk, addressing a &lsquo;tough&rsquo; who was nursing a brindle bulldog with a face like  a Japanese nightmare. Putting a trace of pleading in his voice, he added:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Ned, be a sport. I&rsquo;ll  lay six t&rsquo; four the Clinker outs him inside iv five rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tough answered hoarsely that  he hadn&rsquo;t four warts, and the dog growled in a venomous way, so Benno did not  press his point.</p>
<p>At twenty past eight Tommy  Holland came into the ring, followed a few minutes later by Clinker Gill and  his seconds, two lads from a racing stable with which Clinker was acquainted.  Tommy Holland looked strong and confident, but Clinker was pale and very  nervous. He trembled visibly, his knees knocked as he sat in his chair. One of  the seconds noticed this, and kicked the lad disgustedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See &rsquo;ere, Clink,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;drop  yer bundle, &rsquo;n&rsquo; make a guy iv me, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll pelt yeh a few meself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clinker&rsquo;s lip trembled, and a  tear rolled down his cheek, which he wiped with his glove.</p>
<p>The MC. and official announcer  was in the ring. He was a retired lightweight run to flesh, and sported a face  like a freak potato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gents,&rdquo; he said, addressing the  dress circle, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask yez kindly t&rsquo; put out yer smokes &rsquo;n&rsquo; give the boys a  chance. Youse,&rdquo; he added, turning with some fierceness on the sixpenny patrons,  &ldquo;stop smokin&rsquo; &rsquo;r ye&rsquo;ll land in the fat. A let me &rsquo;ave ter talk t&rsquo; yer agin.  Gents,&rdquo; he repeated, softening his voice, &ldquo;this &rsquo;ere&rsquo;s a perliminry iv eight  rounds, &rsquo;tween a pair iv unknowns. I may tell yeh it all erbout a bit iv skirt,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; I think I can promise yeh a dead willin&rsquo; go. Nar then, lads, get ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The announcer then joined the  seconds, and there was some argument over the appointment of a referee. During  the discussion Clinker&rsquo;s nervousness increased to such an extent that he began  to whimper piteously, mopping up his tears with his gloves.</p>
<p>The announcer stepped forward  again. &ldquo;Is Mr Peter Nickie present in th&rsquo; &rsquo;all?&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Mr Nicklie was present. He arose  with dignity. He was a fat and florid bookmaker, with a reputation for paying  successful backers with stoush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Both parties is willin&rsquo; t&rsquo; &rsquo;ave  you referee this &rsquo;ere, Pete,&rdquo; said the announcer, and Peter obligingly rolled  through the ropes, and swayed into a corner.</p>
<p>Mr Nickie was now seen to be  lamentably drunk. He propped himself securely against a post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is yez all ready?&rdquo; he said.  &ldquo;Shake &rsquo;an&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys advanced into the  centre, Clinker pushed behind by his second, and touched gloves. They returned  to their corners, and the timekeeper smote the gong, a superannuated dinner  tray.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Box On!&rdquo; gurgled the referee,  and Clinker Gill faced his enemy.</p>
<p>Clinker was snivelling; his face  was very white; there was a wild look in his eye. The boys circled round and  round, moving their hands mechanically. For a whole minute there was no attempt  to strike a blow; then Tommy rushed furiously, whirling his arms, and Clinker  went down. He rose again, still weeping and Holland rushed him again, and again Gill, was  prostrated by the impact. On his hands and knees, his face pathetically  contorted, and tears streaming down his cheeks, Clinker seemed, to be looking  for a way of escape, but all exits were blocked. It seemed as if the whole  world was screaming derision at him.</p>
<p>Gill arose, and Tommy charged  him. Utterly demoralized, Clinker turned and ran. He ran three times round the  ring, hotly pursued by Tommy Holland, and the onlookers roared with laughter.  After the third lap, Tommy overtook Gill, and hit him in the small of the back,  and Clinker fell again. While he was down the gong sounded, and the pride of  Spats&rsquo; factory was dragged into his corner, and sat there, blubbering dismally,  while his seconds fanned him, and covered him with scoffing and curses.</p>
<p>Tommy Holland came straight from  his corner at the sound of the gong, and hit Clinker hard on the nose, and  Clinker went to the floor. Clinker got up and Tommy hit him again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh blinded cow!&rdquo; squealed Gill,  and he whirled a glove on to Tommy&rsquo;s ear. He hurled his left, and hit Tommy on  the mark. The crowd applauded. Clinker&rsquo;s blubbering was loud now, but there was  a note of anger in it. He charged at his opponent, head down, and pounded with  both hands. Clinching, he got Holland&rsquo;s  head under his arm, and punched him five times on the nose, while Tommy&rsquo;s  seconds howled for a foul and the referee nodded in his corner, swaying on the  ropes.</p>
<p>When the gong clashed the boxers  continued fiercely fighting, and Clinker&rsquo;s seconds had to tear him off. Benno  was applauding like a madman, and yelling advice. The crowd was delighted.  Clinker made a dash out of his chair to get at the foe again, and had to be  carried struggling to the seat.</p>
<p>Gill was no longer pale, and his  nervousness had evaporated. The third round was full of fight. Clinker waded in.  He forgot all he had learned, and utterly ignored Benno&rsquo;s wise advice. He hit  in holds, he hit anyhow; he butted, and palmed, and screwed, and broke every  known rule. Tommy had a cut lip, a bleeding ear, and a mouse on one eye. Again  the pride of Spat&rsquo;s had to be torn from his opponent.</p>
<p>The boys spent the greater part  of the fourth round on the floor, but time was not wasted. They fought there  just as well as anywhere else, pasting each other desperately. Clinker bumped  Tommy&rsquo;s nose against the boards, and while the crowd roared and laughed, the  master of ceremonies woke up the referee, and expostulated profanely. Mr Nickie  blinked about vaguely, realized where he was, and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sh all ready? Shake &rsquo;an&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the two minutes were up the  seconds had to disentangle the boys, and drag them to their corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yiv got &rsquo;im done in, Clinker!&rdquo;  yelled the passionate Benno. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s your mutton. Keep that left goin&rsquo; how I told  yeh, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it&rsquo;s a moral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Clinker was deaf and blind to  everything but his mighty wrath. He charged Tommy, and felled him, he smote him  on the chin as he was rising, and Tommy clung to his legs, and climbed up by  them, and punched Clinker in the left eye, putting that organ completely out of  action.</p>
<p>In the sixth they were both  tired, but continued to fight like terriers. In the seventh Clinker had Holland down three times,  but in the eighth and last Tommy freshened up, and made it very willing. They  finished on the floor, punching, clawing, and even kicking.</p>
<p>The lads were carried to their  chairs, and once more the referee was shaken up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s matter?&rdquo; said Mr  Nickie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A decision&mdash;give a decision,  blarst it!&rdquo; hissed the master of ceremonies behind his hand.</p>
<p>Mr Peter Nickie bucked up, he  moved into the centre of the ring, and held aloft an impressive palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gen&rsquo;lemen,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;Smith the  winner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, &rsquo;ere,&rdquo; hissed the M.C.,  &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t no Smith in the fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; said the referee,  staggering to the ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say they ain&rsquo;t no Smith in the  fight. Which lad are yeh givin&rsquo; it to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith the winner!&rdquo; repeated Mr  Nickie, with the air of a man of marked integrity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dammitall, they ain&rsquo;t no  Smith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look &rsquo;ere, Spud Malone,&rdquo; said Mr  Nickie with great dignity, &ldquo;are you refereein&rsquo; thish fight, &rsquo;r &rsquo;m I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I tell yeh they ain&rsquo;t no  Smith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; th&rsquo; &rsquo;ell I care? Smith the  winner!&rdquo; Then the referee rolled out of the ring and fell into his seat, and  the battered boys were led away to the changing room downstairs, while the  over-joyed crowd, more delighted with the fight than it would have been with a  pantomime, simmered down for the serious business of the evening.</p>
<p>The error of Mr Nickie left  things practically as they were with Clinker Gill and Tommy Holland; and Dolly,  who had spent the night of the fight in full enjoyment of a dance at the  Six-penny Quadrille, remained perfectly impartial, so far as they were  concerned. This was fair, since it could be demonstrated quite satisfactorily  that Clinker had won on points and Tommy had won on a foul.</p>
<p>On the Saturday night twelve days  later, two young gentlemen were leaning in fraternal sympathy against the front  of a cobbler&rsquo;s shop in the push-ridden suburb. The were Clinker Gill and Tommy  Holland. Some traces of their battle lingered on the countenances of both, but  they were now bosom friends, drawn together by a common sorrow.</p>
<p>A young lady passed, walking  daintily on high-heeled shoes, with a characteristic projection of the figure,  and wearing a large hat liberally feathered. By her side walked a young man,  his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest, his hat hung precariously on the back  of his head, a blazer screaming the local football colours tossed about his  neck, his cold grey eye defying creation.</p>
<p>Clinker nudged Tommy Holland.  &ldquo;There she goes,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;er,&rdquo; growled, Holland, &ldquo;the nark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The passing fair was Ginge  Hopgood. The young gentleman in charge was &lsquo;Nigger&rsquo; Tish, a promising  welterweight.</p>
<p>Clinker and Tommy have now  resigned all pretensions to Dolly&rsquo;s favour, knowing themselves hopelessly  outclassed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AtaBoxingBout"></a>At a Boxing Bout</h2>
<p>The big building&nbsp;was  crowded. Below in the five shilling and ten shilling reserves, was a flood of  human faces. In the balcony opposite, the two shilling push piled itself  against the railing. The atmosphere was one of blue smoke, and through this the  stout, bald, purple M.C. in the ring shouted the names, weights, and colours of  the competitors in the preliminary tournament, his voice like that of a very  old crow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Struth, his jibs wouldn&rsquo;t earn  peanuts ez gripman on a mussel barrer,&rdquo; said the youth next Benno, sociably.</p>
<p>The clerk looked wise &ldquo;That&rsquo;s  right, Ned,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But Dinny&rsquo;s a good ernough spruicher. Givin&rsquo; chat t&rsquo;  aujinces this size jiggers up the &rsquo;uman organ, I tell yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers, on a seat behind,  touched the lad on the shoulder, and edged him away from Benno with a sidelong  motion of the head. &ldquo;Knows a bit erbout elercutlon, he does,&rdquo; he said  confidentially behind his hand, &ldquo;somethin&rsquo; iv a horater &rsquo;imseif. Fam&rsquo;ly&rsquo;s in  Parlymint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar-rn?&rdquo; said the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S truth,&rdquo; Feathers assured him.  &ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s got the contrac&rsquo; fer scrubbin&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; dustin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get yer ear out, Ned, &rsquo;r he&rsquo;ll  bite it,&rdquo; said Benno sourly to the stranger, suspecting mischief.</p>
<p>Benno had been to a couple of  fights before this, and felt entitled to be regarded as an authority. Down in  his heart he cherished an idea on the strength of the experience thus acquired,  that, should occasion arise, he could give an excellent account of himself. He  had never hit a man, but it seemed easy, and he had magnificent dreams of  outing fourteen-stone foes with a right cross which he had frequently tried on  a bed bolster with success. This visionary feat always took place under the  eyes of astonished and admiring multitudes.</p>
<p>Two featherweights were  scrambling in the ring, exchanging wild swings, and the referee was dodging  about, looking for points in a pointless exhibition, Benno watched closely,  making a little critical &lsquo;tut-tut-tut&rsquo; now and again.</p>
<p>During the rests the clerk  instructed the lad next him with a wise old air. The lad chewed gravely, and  said little. Occasionally he jerked a quaint grimace at an acquaintance on the  off side, but nothing in his attitude was intended to disturb the clerk&rsquo;s  pleasing faith in himself. The lad had a thick ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;Brien &rsquo;ll out &lsquo;im this round,&rdquo;  said Benno with calm confidence, when the gong sounded. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll get that crool  right iv his ercross, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Scorcher&rsquo;ll go t&rsquo; bunk, you take it frim the  prefessor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bin in the game yerself, Ned,&rdquo;  said the lad, with a touch of mock reverence.</p>
<p>Benno lowered his voice. He had  an uneasy consciousness of the proximity of Feathers and Nicholas Don, the  driver. &ldquo;Oh, nothin&rsquo; t&rsquo; speak of,&rdquo; he said in the way of a man deliberately  hiding his light. &ldquo;Matter ev a scrap &rsquo;er two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfeshional?&rdquo; asked the lad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No-o,&rdquo; said Benno, &ldquo;not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>O&rsquo;Brien aimed a blind swing at  Scorcher; Scorcher took it on his glove, and prodded his man a straight left  flush. &ldquo;Ha-ha,&rdquo; cried Benno, starting up excitedly. &ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell you?  O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;ll out &rsquo;im; O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s got &rsquo;im goin&rsquo;! He&rsquo;s got &rsquo;im goin&rsquo;! Five t&rsquo;  O&rsquo;Brien! I bet five t&rsquo; one O&rsquo;Brien!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In cherry-bobs!&rdquo; said a derisive  voice.</p>
<p>Before the clerk could frame an  apt rejoinder, the Scorcher planted a left on O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s mark, and a right on  his chin, and O&rsquo;Brien went down. Eleven seconds later he was carried to his  corner, as limp as a dead eel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A quitter!&rdquo; said Benno,  disgustedly. &ldquo;The Scorcher never touched &rsquo;im. That&rsquo;s often the way with clever  sparrers, they&rsquo;ve got science, but no &rsquo;eart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Benno went on to explain to  the lad with the thick ear how O&rsquo;Brien must have beaten the Scorcher to dough  if he had kept at him. The lad seemed quite grateful for the polite attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If &rsquo;e&rsquo;d on&rsquo;y kep&rsquo; that left iv  &rsquo;is goin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said Benno regretfully.</p>
<p>A youth in front rounded on the  clerk with vociferous disgust. &ldquo;Garn, get work!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;O&rsquo;Brien never had a  possible. &rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t got a left &rsquo;and, and &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t got a right. &rsquo;E&rsquo;s a gander. &rsquo;E  don&rsquo;t know enough to win a tombstone novice tournament up in the &rsquo;Ome for  Incurables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Benno, composedly,  &ldquo;p&rsquo;raps I know somethin&rsquo; erbout the game. It&rsquo;s just possible. Then again, o&rsquo;  course, I may be little Georgie, the gazob, &rsquo;n&rsquo; maybe I&rsquo;m goat ernough t&rsquo; gnaw  the posters off the &rsquo;oardin if I ain&rsquo;t watched.&rdquo; He looked about to note the  effect of this preposterous supposition, and then warmed up. &ldquo;But, all the  same, Ned, I&rsquo;m bettin&rsquo; twenty t&rsquo; five in quids O&rsquo;Brien does Scorcher up inside  seven rounds with two-ounce gloves. Come, now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo; out,&rdquo; snorted the other; &ldquo;you  don&rsquo;t know boxin&rsquo; from dominoes. Get back t&rsquo; the socks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benno grew rash. Money was  nothing to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make it a &rsquo;undred t&rsquo; twenty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; arrange the  match meseif. A &rsquo;undred t&rsquo; twenty in Jimmy O&rsquo;Gobs. Say what?&rdquo; He even plunged  his hand in his trousers pocket, where lurked three and fourpence and a bone  stud. &ldquo;Is it a bet?&rdquo; he asked, defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name ain&rsquo;t Chirnside,&rdquo;  growled the youth, quite over-whelmed. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got twenty ticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then get &rsquo;em &rsquo;n&rsquo; pull the  string,&rdquo; retorted the clerk. He looked about him magnificently. Several people  were regarding him with marked respect. Benno exulted. He felt that he was  being mistaken for a bookmaker. &ldquo;Listen t&rsquo; the oof bird twitter,&rdquo; he said &ldquo;How  does it talk &rsquo;em down.&rdquo; He slapped his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do yo&rsquo; think of Brophy&rsquo;s  chance in the big fight, young gentleman?&rdquo; asked the greybeard on Benno&rsquo;s left,  with proper diffidence.</p>
<p>Benno looked him over slowly,  somewhat superciliously, took out a cigar-case, and drew out a cigar. It was a  somewhat worn and ragged cigar, and Benno, who was no smoker, had once taken it  for a threepenny shout. It came in handy now. He lit it like a millionaire.  Then he condescended to speak. &ldquo;If yer wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; pick up good money dirt  cheap, Whiskers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;back Brophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fer a win or a place?&rdquo; asked the  derisive voice.</p>
<p>Young Mr Dickson felt he could  afford to ignore the interjection. &ldquo;Put yer plate on Brophy,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;his  chances &rsquo;re all right. He&rsquo;s got the quids ez good ez in &rsquo;is &rsquo;and. Hark to the  prophet. I admit the big feller&rsquo;s strong &rsquo;n&rsquo; game, but what&rsquo;s &rsquo;e done?&rdquo; He looked  hard at the old gentleman, toying daintily with his ragged cigar the while, and  repeated, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s &rsquo;e done?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, that&rsquo;s the point,&rdquo;  said the greybeard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereas, look at Brophy,&rdquo;  continued Benno for the benefit of the company, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s bin through &rsquo;em all. He&rsquo;s  a bit small fer this, but he&rsquo;s got the science. He&rsquo;s used t&rsquo; handlin&rsquo; big  blokes, too, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you just watch out &rsquo;n&rsquo; see him quilt Mr Rocker Dodd from goin'  t&rsquo; beddy-bye. Dodd won&rsquo;t &rsquo;it &rsquo;im, he&rsquo;s too shifty. He&rsquo;ll just pelt &rsquo;em inter  Rocker&rsquo;s biscuit barrel, &rsquo;n&rsquo; slide out every time the &rsquo;eavyweight offers t&rsquo;  pass &rsquo;im one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever seen either of &rsquo;em fight?&rdquo;  asked the unbeliever in front.</p>
<p>For a moment Benno was taken  back. As a matter of fact, he had not. He rallied quickly. &ldquo;Have I seen &rsquo;em!  Have I what?&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Brophy&rsquo;s ez quick ez dam&rsquo; it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; gets erbout a  bit, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t seen Brophy,&rdquo; growled  the other, &ldquo;but this Dodd can shift. He ain&rsquo;t as slow as a hearse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; on all right,  Ned,&rdquo; said Benno soothingly. &ldquo;When you&rsquo;re growed up you&rsquo;ll know a bit, I  promise yeh, but just now I wouldn&rsquo;t open me head too wide erbout boxin&rsquo; iv I  was you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benno was very excitable and very  demonstrative during the other preliminary bouts. He brandished a notebook and  talked in hundreds with the glibness of a King of the Ring. He even shouted  directions to the combatants, using their Christian names familiarly.</p>
<p>Feathers and the Don, sitting  behind, were enjoying themselves immensely. They refrained from interfering for  fear of spoiling &lsquo;our Mr Dickson&rsquo;s&rsquo; flow of skite, and the clerk, in his great  exultation, had forgotten their existence.</p>
<p>But it was when the fight of the  night came on that Benno excelled himself. While the men were in their corners  his enthusiasm in the cause of Brophy manifested itself in a reckless offering  of the odds to all and sundry. He stood on his chair gesticulating over the  heads of the standing crowd, till those behind him howled him down.</p>
<p>Mr Dickson&rsquo;s cheap, dry cigar  burst into flame at this point, but that did not disconcert him. Threats of  personal violence he treated with a cold scornful smile. He hoped he was  looking as if he could fight a bit.</p>
<p>In his calmer moments our hero  invited the lad with the thick ear to call on him at his hotel&mdash;Benno, it must  not be forgotten, lived in a humble five-roomed cottage with his ma and his  sister Amelia&mdash;and he would teach him a few hits that might be useful to him in  his dealings with a cruel world.</p>
<p>In the first round Mike Brophy  showed himself a flash fighter, and very fanciful in his movements. He had a  fine figure and feline grace, and was anxious to display himself in the  limelight, and, while he was pouting his chest and striking attitudes for the  benefit of his artistic minority, Rocker Dodd, who was a hard-headed, lumbering  pug with no eye for the beautiful, swung in a punch, a punch that lifted the  smaller man up off his two feet, and dropped him like a bag of scraps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On&rsquo;y a slip!&rdquo; cried Benno. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s  up agin all right.&rdquo; And so he was, but looking like a man full of warm whisky  suddenly ejected into the cold night.</p>
<p>Rocker sprang at Mike again, and  Mike ducked by instinct into safety under his enemy&rsquo;s wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;d I tell you,&rdquo; squealed the  clerk. &ldquo;See that? What&rsquo;d I tell yeh? Ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;e a beaut? Rocker can&rsquo;t &rsquo;it &rsquo;im. He  can&rsquo;t &rsquo;it &rsquo;im, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo; Rocker shook his man off, and punched with right  and left, putting a lop-sided head on Brophy, and then the gong sounded, and a  thankful fighter sank into Mike&rsquo;s corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t &rsquo;e a beaut?&rdquo; vociferated  Benno. &ldquo;Good man, Brophy! It&rsquo;s twenty t&rsquo; one on yeh! Twenty t&rsquo; one Brophy!&rdquo;  cried the clerk, raising his voice. &ldquo;Twenty t&rsquo; one Brophy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A red-faced, pimply man bobbed up  out of the crowd, and pinned Benno with a fat forefinger. &ldquo;Done!&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take that, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty t&rsquo; one in quids erbout  Brophy!&rdquo; repeated Benno, flourishing his pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same fer me, mister,&rdquo; said a  sport with a broken nose, tugging at Benno&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<p>Several others were anxious to do  business with Mr Dickson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a dollar worth in that,&rdquo; said the lad with  the thick ear. &ldquo;Referee&rsquo;s decision.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benno was too elated to heed  them. He was shouting expert advice to Brophy&rsquo;s corner, &ldquo;Give &rsquo;im the tow&rsquo;l!&rdquo;  he cried, disgustedly. &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t want no sermons from you. Wag the washin&rsquo;,  blarst yeh!&rdquo; He turned to the lad with the thick ear. &ldquo;Wish I was in his  corner,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bitter bad mozzle fer Brophy yeh  ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d be glad t&rsquo; know all you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the second round Brophy was  more anxious to keep out of trouble than to show his elegant shape, and he  sprinted about the ring with Rocker lumbering after him, punching anyhow and  anywhere. Twice Mike was down, thinking, but that did not damp Benno&rsquo;s ardour.</p>
<p>The clerk was now offering thirty  to one Brophy with splendid prodigality, and there were many takers whom he  didn&rsquo;t even notice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll let the big bloke wear  &rsquo;imself out, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then he&rsquo;ll dish &rsquo;im up on the arf shell with a taste iv  lemon,&rdquo; said &lsquo;our Mr Dickson&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Presently Brophy was bleeding  from a cut over the eye, and had a numbed nose and a split lip, and Rocker Dodd  was wishing the fight would begin in earnest.</p>
<p>During the next interval Benno  was more confident than ever. He said it was picking up money backing Brophy.  He casually offered to lay two hundred to ten about it, He addressed Brophy  like an old and valued friend, advising him to keep cool and fight his own  hand.</p>
<p>Mike tried to make the third  round a foot-race, but Mr Dodd was there, and wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it. He blocked  Brophy in the corners, and punched him, and his punches had all the nervous  energy that is in the heels of an exuberant young pack mule. When they reached  Mike, Mike&rsquo;s feet sprang up, and he struck the boards with the back of his  head.</p>
<p>For the fifth time in two minutes  Mike was down, and now his better judgement prevailed, and he pretended to be  asleep in order to evade the responsibility of getting up again. The seconds  called him early, the ten-seconds-check reminded him it was time to be up and  doing, but Mike slept on. It was all over. The referee, in a few terse,  epigrammatic words declared Rocker Dodd the winner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yaha-h, a schlinter!&rdquo; cried  Benno. &ldquo;A schlinter! A schlinter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The red-faced man was working his  way towards Benno through the press, pinning the clerk with that imperious  forefinger. He took Benno by a button. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a matter o&rsquo; twenty jim you&rsquo;re  owin&rsquo; me, Ned,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, scratch!&rdquo; retorted the  clerk. &ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t no bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sport with the perverted nose  and the lad with the thick ear were clamouring for an immediate settlement of  their claims. Several others, thinking the bluff might be worth it, put in  large demands. The red-faced man was furious and threatening. He recited  terrible things that would happen to &lsquo;our Mr Dickson&rsquo; if he did not instantly  hand out twenty pounds.</p>
<p>The painful nature of the  situation flashed upon Benno. He had been taken too seriously. He went chalk  white, his legs wobbled foolishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bli&rsquo;me, &rsquo;twas on&rsquo;y a joke,&rdquo; he  protested. &ldquo;I was just talkin&rsquo;. I ain&rsquo;t got a bean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blessed welsher!&rdquo; yelled the  red-faced man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An infernal gun!&rdquo; cried the  sport.</p>
<p>Twenty hands fell upon Benno. He  went down into dark night that was full of arms and feet and broken chairs, and  his only sensation was of being a mere scrap of himself whirling in the  blackness, in which the arms, the chairs, and the feet continually multiplied  themselves.</p>
<p>The packer and Nicholas Don, ably  assisted by six policemen, effected a rescue, and what they rescued was a weary  fragment. Very reluctant were the police to give Feathers charge of it, for it  was ragged, dusty, blood-stained, hatless and battered, and would have been a  striking object lesson in the dock next morning.</p>
<p>However, the packer&rsquo;s eloquence  prevailed, and he and Nick took the weary fragment away with them, wrapped in  Nick&rsquo;s over-coat. Without that coat it would not have been possible to  introduce the clerk into mixed company on a tram, what remained of his clothes  being hardly sufficient to establish identification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re the king cop-out,&rdquo;  said the packer, having delivered Benno into his sister&rsquo;s hands at his own door  &ldquo;If yeh was t&rsquo; go t&rsquo; church the boiler &rsquo;ud bust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Benno answered never a word. His  splendid spirit was broken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="SusieGannonsYoungMan"></a>Susie Gannon&rsquo;s Young Man</h2>
<p>Miss Gannon&nbsp;made  rapid strides in the bag factory. She came to the flat fresh from the country,  a tall, bony girl of sixteen, very angular, all legs and wings with strangely  obtrusive feet, large freckles, and a face like that of a patient horse. At  this time, too, Susie Gannon&rsquo;s apparel was markedly inadequate. She had grown  out of everything, and the abruptness of her skirts, and the strain upon her  jackets, and the brevity of her sleeves, showed how her parents had been  distanced in their well-meant efforts to keep pace with their daughter&rsquo;s  startling development. The whole effect made an irresistible appeal to the  strong sense of humour in the women of the world dominant on the top flat, and  Susie provoked much merriment for many days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blime, she looks like a shillin&rsquo;  ling wrapped in a penny stamp!&rdquo; cried Harrerbeller Harte.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See yeh got yer old brown&mdash;brown,  brown&mdash;see yeh got yer old brown &rsquo;at on,&rdquo; piped the ex-professional fat girl  every morning, when Susie&rsquo;s bizarre felt headdress appeared above the stairs.</p>
<p>The girls at Spats&rsquo; were not  over-burdened with sensibilities. They did not scruple to make merry at the  expense of the smaller misfortunes and the little idiosyncrasies of their  weaker sisters. The factory had a peculiar spirit of hoydenish frivolity; it  helped to ward off weariness and break the tedium of a set task. Susie served  her time as the common butt. It was everybody&rsquo;s lot.</p>
<p>In those earlier days Susie was  gaunt and timid. She stole into the factory like a furtive cat. She loved to  creep into cover of any kind, to get anything between her and the ribald  pasters&mdash;a stack of bags or a heap of envelopes on a board. She was grateful  even for a gas bracket that she could hang a strip of paper on. But marvellous  is the sex&rsquo;s adaptability; its power of development is wonderful. In two months  Susie was as pert and as self-assertive as the best of them.</p>
<p>Miss Gannon had not been at  Spats&rsquo; many days when she told Kitty Coudray, who was posing as a sympathetic  soul, that she had left a lover behind her in the country, and Kitty, with a  shocking lack of respect for the confidence reposed in her, instantly  communicated the information to the whole factory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-oh, girls!&rdquo; she cried,  &ldquo;little Gannon&rsquo;s got a John iv her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Harrerbeller Harte  in mock wonder. &ldquo;T&rsquo; do ez she likes with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kitty, &ldquo;&rsquo;or very  own&mdash;&rsquo;ers for keeps. He&rsquo;s a squatter &lsquo;r somethin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his name&rsquo;s Oliver  Thripny, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;ll call fer her with the fam&rsquo;ly carriage &rsquo;n&rsquo; pair when he comes  into town, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; be married in white satin shoes &rsquo;n&rsquo; hon blossom.  She sez Oliver&rsquo;s got a noble bearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he has,&rdquo; cried Susie  defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said Miss Harte to the  pasters, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s up agen&rsquo; yeh. There ain&rsquo;t one iv yeh got a bloke with a noble  bearin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writ her a love letter,&rdquo;  continued Kitty when the yells of derision had subsided, fluttering a slip of  paper in the air. &ldquo;Would yeh like t&rsquo; hear it? No, iv course not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen girls scampered to  Kitty&rsquo;s board, and danced about her with shrill clamour; but Fuzzy Ellis went  hopping among them, protesting bitterly, spluttering threats of fines and  dismissal and with the help of the sullen forewoman he drove the girls back to  their boards again.</p>
<p>Kitty Coudray retained the  letter, however, and read it to a large audience at lunch time. It was the love  letter of an uncultured youth, written with dire pains, wonderfully spelt and  quaintly worded. Evidently the opening passage had been borrowed from a  tradesman&rsquo;s circular. The document began: &ldquo;Dear sir or madam, this is to inform  you how I&rsquo;m still lovin&rsquo; you with all me hart.&rdquo; And it concluded: &ldquo;I have the  honour to remain, yours obedient to command, Oliver Thripny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course the Beauties revelled  in the outpourings of Oliver&rsquo;s simple soul, and Susie whose sense of the  ridiculous was as yet but poorly developed, filled with triumph in the face of  the loudly expressed envy of the girls.</p>
<p>Susie&rsquo;s squatter was adopted by  the factory. It expressed unlimited faith in him. It endowed him with great  wealth and superlative personal attractions, and affected to believe that his  love for Miss Gannon, as expressed in his letters, was a consuming passion  beside which the torrid affection of the ducal hero for the simple heroine in  penny fiction was pale and cold and weak.</p>
<p>George Mills, alias Feathers,  entered into the spirit of the comedy with unaffected joy. He pretended to find  in Miss Gannon&rsquo;s equine cast of countenance a marked resemblance to a popular  racehorse, and rechristened her accordingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ella, Carbine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;half  a mo&rsquo;. I want t&rsquo; whisper. Will yeh put in a word with the squatter fer me nibs?  I&rsquo;m sick iv this grip; it don&rsquo;t suit me style. I&rsquo;m hambitious, &rsquo;n&rsquo; a bloke  don&rsquo;t get no charnce t&rsquo; improve his social position snatching bags in a measly  city crib. What I&rsquo;d like would be the management iv a big cattle run where I  could spread meself &rsquo;n&rsquo; develop, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I s&rsquo;pose iv yeh was t&rsquo; put in a kind word  with Mr. Thripny it ud be ez good ez done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he ain&rsquo;t got that much  land,&rdquo; said Susie dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So yeh twitter!&rdquo; answered the  unbelieving Feathers. &ldquo;Fair dinkum yeh might use yer influence, Miss Gannon.  &rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t ez iv I didn&rsquo;t know the game. I managed a milk run onst, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve  sheared all our own cows fer years past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Gannon promised to see about  it, raking up the while an abbreviated stocking, much of the leg of which had  been worn out, doing service at foot.</p>
<p>Harrerbeller bespoke the position  of house-keeper, and the ex-professional fat girl thought she would like to be  nursery governess.</p>
<p>The situation was almost forced  upon poor Susie, but she certainly made a game effort to live up to it, and  every day her young man in the country increased in importance, wealth, and  manly beauty. Kitty Coudray, who had Susie&rsquo;s confidence, never failed to inform  the factory of the latest development.</p>
<p>The packer introduced a highly  decorative oleograph of a member of the royal family&mdash;a picture of astounding  beauty which he hung on the factory wall, decorated with a frame of tinted  papers, and labelled &ldquo;Oliver&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Oliver Thripny legend spread  through the establishment. Susie met with elaborate courtesy from the clerks  downstairs, and the compositors were painfully polite. Billy, the printer&rsquo;s  devil, was humble, almost piteous, pleading, cap in hand, for the position of  lady&rsquo;s companion for his dear mother. His mother, he said, had been lady&rsquo;s  companion and confidential friend to all the best families in Paddy&rsquo;s Alley,  and if Susie would engage her in some ladylike office at a prodigious salary  when she married wealth and station, he would be, oh, so grateful. Billy the  Boy wiped his eyes with his cap when he mentioned his mother.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Miss Gannon was  steadily improving. She was taken from the folding board and put on to  piecework, and she made great progress as a paster. Her comical, out-of-date  garments fell from her, replaced by more stylish and appropriate articles.</p>
<p>Susie was earning good money, and  she made a corresponding development in her ambition. Oliver grew and expanded.  Susie was picking up town ideas, and she grafted city traits on to her country  lover. His letters began to display some literary pretension. They lost their  quaint and captivating stupidity, and became ponderously correct and stilted.  They were full of fine expressions of love and devotion, wordy protestations,  and formal offers of service. Harrerbeller was quick to note the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blime, that ain&rsquo;t a love  letter,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit iv parsing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. he&rsquo;s &rsquo;ighly edjicated,  Holiver is,&rdquo; said Susie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; the &rsquo;andwritin&rsquo;s different,&rdquo;  said Feathers. &ldquo;But he&rsquo;s had &rsquo;em writ be his privit secretary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The letters became more numerous.  Then one morning the ex-professional fat girl brought in a copy of somebody&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Ready Letter Writer for Young Lovers&rdquo;, and huddled away in a corner at  lunch-time, the packer and half-a-dozen of the Beauties went through it, and  discovered the source of Oliver&rsquo;s eloquence. Susie was up to page thirteen, and  had used every letter so far. Obviously she had been writing love letters to  herself, and evidently it was her intention to go straight through the book.  There had long been a suspicion that Oliver Thripny had no existence in fact,  and now that suspicion was held to be confirmed; but the conspirators swore  secrecy, and Susie was encouraged to further flights.</p>
<p>Susie produced more letters, and  eventually a cabinet photograph of Oliver. She showed the picture first to  sympathetic Mr. Mills, and the packer went into ecstasies with Benno, the  clerk, at his elbow, and a lot of pasters crowded about him, craning to get a  glimpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bloke with arf a neye kin see  he&rsquo;s nobly born,&rdquo; said Mills, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; iv yeh don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s a gentleman iv  means, there&rsquo;s the di&rsquo;mond studs t&rsquo; prove it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; look at his proud, cold  manner, his mock kids, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his &rsquo;air caught back like Padder Whosths, pianner  scratcher&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow beautiful the man is!&rdquo;  moaned the scandalous Harrerbeller.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; such breedin&rsquo;!&rdquo; said Benno.  &ldquo;But what iv the down droopin&rsquo; yaller mo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s &rsquo;ad it pulled, yeh chump,&rdquo;  retorted the packer.</p>
<p>Mills begged the photograph, and  it was hung on the wall with the other trophies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a photo iv one iv them  beauty actors,&rdquo; the packer told Harrerbeller, in confidence, some minutes  later. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re a bob a quart at the fancy-goods up town. Ain&rsquo;t yeh noticed  it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Harte threw her pasty  hessian apron over her head, and squealed with rapture. &ldquo;Love a duck! Susie&rsquo;s a  treat,&rdquo; she gasped &ldquo;This is better&rsquo;n the wicked lady in the drammer. I&rsquo;m  wonderin&rsquo; what&rsquo;s next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next came one afternoon, when  a young man arrived on the top flat from the front stairs. He was a very  diffident young man, and plainly fresh from the wilds. He took off his hat a he  entered, and stood with it in his hand, with the reverent irresolution some  strangers display in church. He had very large feet, and his trousers were hung  too high. So large were his feet and so heavy his boots that he looked like an  immovable object standing there before the gaping factory. His hands were large  too, and heavy and very red. His hair was profuse, and his face was covered  with a fluffy down that caught a strange radiance from the sunbeams sloping  through the windows.</p>
<p>The strange young man&rsquo;s clothes  were new but curiously cut, and so small for him that each piece had an  appearance of being semi-detached. He had adopted a tall white collar for this  occasion only, and it rode high up above his coat at the back. His countenance  was honest but not intellectual, and his neck very long. He gazed sheepishly  about the place, wearing an uncomfortable grin, and the Beauties gazed on him  in strained silence, awaiting developments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on t&rsquo; it,&rdquo; said Benno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s  lost its mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers looked with great  interest. &ldquo;Looks a bit like a goose with ears, don&rsquo;t &rsquo;e?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The stranger found tongue.  &ldquo;Please, does Miss Gannon work here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>A whoop of delight welled from  the pasters, and a dozen brushes pointed to Susie&rsquo;s board, but Harrerbeller  Harte intervened. She confronted the young man, and bobbed with a ridiculous  curtsey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What name, if yeh please, sir?&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oliver Thripny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another whoop, louder,  longer, more ecstatic than the first, but Harrerbeller disregarded it. &ldquo;Yes,  sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Walk this way, if you please sir!&rdquo; She led him between the  boards, with a ridiculous affectation of the manners of a shopwalker. &ldquo;Nice  weather we&rsquo;re &rsquo;avin&rsquo;, sir,&rdquo; she simpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beautiful, Miss, thank you, and  how&rsquo;s yourself?&rdquo; stammered Oliver.</p>
<p>This broke up Harrerbeller&rsquo;s  gravity and she had only strength to point Miss Cannon out before collapsing.  But the factory had hurriedly composed itself to enjoy the encounter between  Susie Cannon and her young man.</p>
<p>Susie had been almost petrified  on the discovery of Oliver standing hat in hand in the gangway. Now she was  working at top-speed, with averted eyes and her face scarlet with the conflict  of many emotions. Evidently she was taken wholly by surprise, and the drop from  the ideal to the real left her in a state of utter confusion. Oliver came  awkwardly to her board, hat in hand still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Suze,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how&rsquo;re  you doin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie turned up her Roman nose  and closed her eyes in an expression of scorn, and continued her work. Oliver  raised his voice, &ldquo;How are you, Suze?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I said I&rsquo;d come after you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Susie, with eyes still closed and  nose still elevated, turned to him for a moment, and said contemptuously: &ldquo;What  yeh givin&rsquo; us? I don&rsquo;t know yeh from a ding-bat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was astounded.  &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t y&rsquo; know me, Suze?&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Why, I&rsquo;m Oliver&mdash;Oliver Thripny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; said Susie, intensifying  her scorn.</p>
<p>Oliver&rsquo;s situation was a very  painful one. He gazed piteously about the room, as if seeking corroboration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, go on, you know me all right,&rdquo;  he pleaded. &ldquo;I on&rsquo;y come down lars&rsquo; night, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I thought you&rsquo;d be glad t&rsquo; see  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phew!&rdquo; repeated Susie, accenting  her contempt to the utmost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m bloomin&rsquo; well  jiggered!&rdquo; said Mr. Thripny, helplessly.</p>
<p>The Beauties were moved by some  small promptings of compassion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn, &rsquo;ive the lad a show!&rdquo; said  the fat girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Oliver the squatter come t&rsquo;  claim his bride,&rdquo; pleaded Kitty Coudray. &ldquo;Kiss him pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; squealed Miss Gannon,  with a sudden access of fury. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t! &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t! &rsquo;Tisn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benno&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, crikey,&rdquo; murmured the  astounded bushman, &ldquo;that&rsquo;ll tell you. Says I ain&rsquo;t Oliver Thripny. Crikey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; cried Susie, &ldquo;you  know you ain&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;re a himposter. It&rsquo;s forgery, that&rsquo;s what it is. The p&rsquo;lice  orter be sent fer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crikey!&rdquo; said the helpless  Oliver, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t &rsquo;a&rsquo; believed it. Oh, I say, Suze, have a good look at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Susie. &ldquo;Go away.  You ain&rsquo;t a bit like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Oliver invited the bursting  of the storm. Appealing to Harrerbeller in his amazement he blurted: &ldquo;There,  that&rsquo;ll tell you the difference good clothes makes in a bloke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shriek that followed welled  from thirty throats, and befoe the beauties had recovered from their paroxysm  of mirth Oliver had fled down the stairs. In the language of the flat Susie &lsquo;got  nothing&rsquo; for the next hour or two. As the pasters worked they exercised their  ingenuity in reminding Miss Gannon of what she had lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more garding parties et  Gov&rsquo;ment &rsquo;Ouse fer you, me lady,&rdquo; said the fat girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot price th&rsquo; opera &rsquo;n&rsquo; the  fam&rsquo;ly jewels?&rdquo; said Hareerbeller. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve a blue duck fer Susie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who&rsquo;ll drive yeh in a  brougham &rsquo;n&rsquo; pair, &rsquo;n&rsquo; spatter yeh with di&rsquo;monds?&rdquo; asked Kitty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fame, fortune, lux&rsquo;ry, &rsquo;igh  society, all gone,&rdquo; said the packer. &ldquo;She might iv &rsquo;ad mullingatawney soup &rsquo;n&rsquo;  hice cream fer dinn every day, &rsquo;n&rsquo; swelled it with the best, but she done in  her chances in a fit iv pick.&rdquo; Feathers meant &lsquo;pique&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But the factory had not seen the  last of Oliver. He came up the stairs again at about five o&rsquo;clock, and turned  to pull something after him. He helped a short, fat, red-faced female to the  flat. She was about forty-five, and she cuddled a large umbrella, and faced the  pasters like a startled horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; cried the bushie, &ldquo;I am  Oliver Thripny, and here&rsquo;s mother to prove it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;hoy&rsquo; that greeted this  announcement disturbed the whole establishment. Mid the laughter and badinage  Susie escaped, and entrenched herself in the dressing-room.</p>
<p>Boldly Mrs. Thripny confronted  the storm. The climb had robbed her of breath, but she brandished her brolly in  the face of the factory. The pasters&rsquo; demonstration was regarded by her as one  of open enmity, whereas, as with most outbreaks amongst the hands, it was mere  devilment, without a shadow of malice. A scampish craving for diversion inspired  such displays. The Beauties were not tender souls themselves, and did not look  for supersitiveness in others.</p>
<p>Mrs. Thripny grew redder. Her  redness merged into purple. She hurled thunderbolts at the laughing hoydens  from the end of her fat gamp.</p>
<p>Oliver retired before the storm,  and stood trembling at the head of the stairs. Not so his nuggety mother. She  advanced, gasping, full of heroic wrath, and then she burst into language. It  was a torrent, a Niagara. The woman tumbled  great lexicons on the heads of the girls. Her shrill voice penetrated to the  offices. It brought Spats and the junior partner to the top flat. They found  Mrs. Thripny &lsquo;going strong&rsquo;, and the dusty foreman nervously skipping round  just beyond the orbit of her umbrella, excitedly but piteously pleading for  peace.</p>
<p>The lordly proprietor thundered  orders, but Mrs. Thripny lunged at him angrily, gripping his belltopper, and  continued her speech.</p>
<p>Exactly what the woman said  nobody knew, but she said a tremendous deal, and nothing was complimentary to  Spats or the staring hussies, stunned by the downpour they had precipitated.</p>
<p>Mr. Duff, the junior partner,  intervened, and it was quaint to see his timid overtures, but a prod in the ear  from the raging gamp put him out of action.</p>
<p>Then the diplomatic Feathers took  a hand. Feathers was a mere packer and something of a larrikin, perhaps, but in  an emergency he was the wise man of that establishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn!&rdquo; he cried, addressing the  factory generally, &ldquo;le&rsquo; the poor woman be, carn&rsquo;t yeh? &rsquo;Ave a bit iv manners if  y&rsquo; are fact&rsquo;ry rats. It&rsquo;s dead hookety if a decent married woman&rsquo;s t&rsquo; be abused  &rsquo;n&rsquo; hinsulted &rsquo;n&rsquo; treated no better &rsquo;n&rsquo; a Chow. Switch off, carn&rsquo;t yeh? Yeh  might be decent people yerselves some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Thripny, who was now  breathless, fell back beside her ally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ye know a lady when yeh  see one?&rdquo; asked Feathers indignantly. Then, addressing Oliver&rsquo;s mother, he  said: &ldquo;You put it down t&rsquo; their ignorance &rsquo;n&rsquo; bad bringin&rsquo; up, Mrs Thripny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He soothed her with deferential  words, and an air of vast respect, and in three minutes she was under perfect  control. Before she left she invited Feathers to tea on Sunday.</p>
<p>The packer assured Oliver&rsquo;s ma  that nobody doubted the authenticity of Oliver, and there was no intention to  question his legitimacy. This was Mrs. Thripny&rsquo;s sore point. He said he would  send her a written apology, signed by the proprietor and all the employees, and  she departed after the boy, quite satisfied. Feathers called innocently over  the stairs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Thripny, may I bring mother  with me on Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Six months later, when Susie&rsquo;s  squatter was almost forgotten, Susie startled the factory with the announcement  of her forthcoming marriage to Mr. Thripny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s sold out his selection &rsquo;n&rsquo;  bought sand drays. He&rsquo;s makin&rsquo; his five quid a week,&rdquo; said Susie, proudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; ejaculated Feathers; &ldquo;are  yeh his special agin, &rsquo;n&rsquo; after the way yeh dogged on him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Miss Gannon, &ldquo;he could  see all along that was on&rsquo;y my joke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he?&rdquo; answered the packer.  &ldquo;A wise gazob is Oliver&mdash;yeh can&rsquo;t kid &rsquo;im!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheRivals"></a>The Rivals</h2>
<p>Jinny Bitt&mdash;known as  Thripny&mdash;was going on for sixteen, too tall for her age and her width and her  wearing apparel. Her shins were so thin they seemed to have a cutting edge, and  there was too much of them visible, although the frayed, stained and faded  skirt was let down so far in the hope of covering the deficiency that a wide  gap existed between it and the skimpy body part of her costume, where a  quantity of dun-coloured underclothing protruded. Her arms, too, were long and  thin; so was her neck. The long, thin arms came far out of her tight sleeves,  always worn at the elbow and torn in the armpit. The long, thin neck was  surmounted by a very small head decorated with pale, drab-tinted hair that had  been cropped within the year, and was now about a span in length, and amenable  to no kind of treatment. It writhed like shrivelled pea-pods, and Miss Bitt  thought it was curly.</p>
<p>Jinny wore a bit of stale red  ribbon awkwardly knotted in the middle of her swan-like neck, but she was not a  girl who put forth any pretensions to style. Her boots were heelless, and their  symmetry had been destroyed by bigger feet. Her stockings had many holes. The  hat she wore had been a &lsquo;gem&rsquo; in its day and generation, but most of the rim  was nibbled off by the rats and cockroaches abounding on the factory flat, and  its only ornaments were a bootlace and a large brass button. Miss Bitt might  have picked up a better hat any day anywhere, but she seemed cheerfully  unconscious of this one&rsquo;s imperfections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thripny looks ez if she was  painted on elastic, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then stretched,&rdquo; said the packer. The description was  apt.</p>
<p>Coffee Morgan was Miss Bitt&rsquo;s  cobber. She was a girl of about the same age, shorter, and fleshy in an  unhealthy way. She owed her nick-name to her prevailing tone. Her hair might  have been bright red under more favourable conditions, but she oiled it  liberally, and it collected the factory dust and assumed the tint of ground  coffee. Her complexion was like coffee milked, and her disposition was morose.</p>
<p>Miss Morgan dressed rather better  than Miss Bitt, but the Beauties soon discovered that her new dresses were  always made of second-hand material, and her latest hats were at least a  generation too old for the girl, and had evidently come down to her after seeing  long service. From the fact that all her dresses were coffee-coloured, the  Beauties rashly concluded that her grandmother was a &ldquo;Beardie,&rdquo; a brown sect  closely allied to Quakers.</p>
<p>Nearly all the Beauties paired  off. Their mateships were close, affectionate, and to some extent secretive.  Once the alliance was formed, and while it lasted, the two friends seemed to  cherish identical tastes, appetites, and desires. The characteristic is not  peculiar to factory hands; it is noticeable in a young ladies&rsquo; seminary. This  intimacy of Thripny and Coffee Morgan was more quaint than another, because of  Thripny&rsquo;s length and leanness, and Miss Morgan&rsquo;s shortness and shapelessness,  and for the reason that Thripny had the ungainly sprightliness of a half-grown Newfoundland pup, while  her cobber was slow, weighty, and depressed in manner. Miss Bitt was shrill and  voluble; Miss Morgan talked little, and then in a low, mumbling tone, and with  an aggrieved air, as if resenting the task.</p>
<p>The two were typical of the  younger hands from the slum suburbs. They served in the lower branches of the  game, and were still novices. With experience and increase of income would come  something like a sense of decorum, and a passion for fine raiment and brass  bangles; but as yet Thripny was an undisciplined rapscallion of a girl,  street-bred, unconscious, and with no more restraint than the unowned,  shambling, jubilant mongrel you may see brazenly claiming acquaintance with  elegant young ladies in public places.</p>
<p>Turned loose from Spats&rsquo;s, Thripny  tore down Egg Lane, her bony knees tossing up her sparse petticoats, her left  hand hitching some detached or displaced portion of apparel, her right  clutching her battered sugee crib basket, her scrap of a hat dangling from the  bootlace, one end of which she always chewed as a precaution against high winds  or casual mishaps. Now and again she might look back in her wild career and  shout: &ldquo;Come &rsquo;long, Mordie, here&rsquo;s er jinker!&rdquo; And Miss Morgan, a bad second,  would paddle behind, displaying no manner of interest in anything.</p>
<p>The grease-grimed lads at the  egg, ham, and butter market looked out for Thripny, and whooped at her as she  passed. The grimier young men in the potato depot assailed her with joyful  badinage. Miss Bitt&rsquo;s troubles&mdash;she was bent on catching the first jinker or  lorry for home at the Port and had time only for a breathless &ldquo;Ga-an, get  work!&rdquo; which was no more than the civilities demanded.</p>
<p>If it happened to be a timber  jinker Thripny dashed at the protruding beam and scrambled astride, excited and  voluble, shouting encouragement to Miss Morgan as the stout girl made clumsy  efforts to follow suit. At the rope works they were joined by four or five  congenial spirits of their own age, sex and station, and so, triumphantly, with  legs a-swing, squealing jubilant impudence at all sorts and conditions of men,  the Pagans rode home.</p>
<p>The way to work in the morning  was enlivened by frequent encounters with jocose young milkmen, raucous sand  carters, and whimsical butcher&rsquo;s assistants. Strange though it may seem, it is  nevertheless true that no driver of a milk-cart could pass Jinny and Maud  without shouting at them some terse sentiment, the humour of which lay in its  gratuitous insolence. Thripny usually responded for both with a shrill yell:  &ldquo;A-a-a-h, &rsquo;ave it stitched!&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Hi, where yer goin&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the bones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The uninitiated might have  thought the greeting and the response bitter, even vindictive. They were  nothing of the kind. Often they were the preliminaries to an amorous  friendship, and led to votive plates of hot peas and sociable rides in the  swing-boats at the gay market on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Coffee Morgan and Thripny worked  close together at the same board, and when not working they were linked  together in an awkward embrace. They were the closest cobbers the factory had  known, and yet Maud was never anything but sullen and depressed, whereas the  factory often revolted against Jinny&rsquo;s joyful melodies because of their  &lsquo;damnable iteration.&rsquo; It needed Maud&rsquo;s warning growl: &ldquo;Chuck it, Thripny!&rdquo; a  dozen times a day to repress her musical exuberance.</p>
<p>Then, one morning, Miss Bitt came  in alone. &ldquo;Gor bli!&rdquo; said the packer, in amazement, &ldquo;bin a funeral in the  family, er what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak t&rsquo;cher equals!&rdquo; said  Thripny, with none of her usual vivacity.</p>
<p>Coffee Morgan came later, looking  more morose than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Split partners, hev yeh,  Corfee?&rdquo; said the packer. &ldquo;S&rsquo;pose the dark man&rsquo;s come between yer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give yeh swipe cross the jore!&rdquo;  mumbled Miss Morgan.</p>
<p>At their board the pair worked in  silence, as far apart as possible. Thripny had no inclination to sing; she was  ill at ease. Maud&rsquo;s face was set sourly over her work, and she never raised her  eyes. The Beauties were inquiring and derisive, and Jinny, who had hitherto  done all the barracking for herself and Maud, and had always been effective in  retort, was silent now. So matters remained till the afternoon, when Feathers  intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this,&rdquo; said the packer  addressing the factory, &ldquo;Mord saw &rsquo;im first, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Thripny&rsquo;s bin &rsquo;n&rsquo; pinched him.  No wonder Morgan&rsquo;s givin&rsquo; &rsquo;er brusher&mdash;he&rsquo;s the pride iv the habbattoirs, ain&rsquo;t  he, Mordie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coffee Morgan was slapping paste  all over her work, and her small, &lsquo;greenery-yallery&rsquo; eyes were turned up  vindictively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have him on yer thinker,  little sister,&rdquo; continued Mills, with much sympathy, &ldquo;he ain&rsquo;t th&rsquo; on&rsquo;y sardine  in the tin. Put on yer spring millin&rsquo;ry, &rsquo;n&rsquo; get out after a squatter, why  don&rsquo;t yeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point Coffee Morgan&rsquo;s  feelings became too many for her. She uttered a piggish scream of fury, and  darted at Thripny. Clutching her bunch of short hair with one hand Maud smote  her cobber of yesterday about the face and head with her paste brush, and then,  dropping the brush, got at her with the Beauties&rsquo; favourite weapons, and  scratched like a burrowing terrier.</p>
<p>Borne back against the board,  slightly off her perpendicular, Thripny was quite helpless against the fury of  her small enemy. She seemed overcome with a great amazement, and stared with  wide-eyed, stupid surprise, while Miss Morgan scratched, and tore, and punched.  Jinny Bitt&rsquo;s astonishment was so comical that, tragic as the incident was, the  unfeeling Beauties laughed aloud.</p>
<p>The packer went to the rescue,  and struggled with Coffee Morgan, while the lean foreman, in his excitement,  endeavoured to walk through two pasting boards, and fell three times in ten  yards, hastening to quell the riot.</p>
<p>Jinny and Maud were put to work  at separate boards. The former did not recover from her surprise for twenty  minutes, and then she started to cry, and wept long and bitterly, and her tears  ran down the furrows Miss Morgan&rsquo;s nails had made.</p>
<p>During the following three days  Jinny continued silent, and Maud vindictive. There was something of triumph in  Jinny&rsquo;s air, however, that excited Maud beyond bearing. Five times she rushed  Jinny with the intention of inflicting liberal bodily harm, but Maud was  nowhere in a race with Thripny.</p>
<p>The factory was enjoying itself,  but the lean foreman was thrown into pathetic distress of mind. Spats&rsquo;s was  short-handed. If Fuzzy Ellis sacked a girl the authorities below would bound on  him, and break his heart with duplicated abuse; and, on the other hand, if  knowledge of the disturbance above came to the powers below, they would unite  to abase and abuse him. That was what he was there for. Several stout pasters  were posted between the foes to intercept and overcome Coffee Morgan when  wrought too far by silent contemplation of her wrongs.</p>
<p>On Monday morning there was a new  development. Maud came upstairs smiling, actually smiling. The Beauties  squealed, Feathers cried &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; and the town traveller collapsed on a stack of  bags. Maud had not been known to smile even in the old happy days.</p>
<p>Jinny Bitt came up a few minutes  later. Her eyes were red and swollen, and she was the picture of misery. The  Beauties greeted her with a shout that broke her up, and, mopping her tears  with the front of her jacket, she bellowed dismally on her way round to the  changing-room.</p>
<p>There was a silence of seven  minutes, and then a yell announced the outbreak of hostilities. The packer rushed,  but was just too late. Thripny had struck Maud on the head with the hot, iron  pasteladle, and Maud was thinking it over on the floor.</p>
<p>Now, the difficulty was to keep  Jinny Bitt off Coffee Morgan. Jinny, as the turned worm, was much more  ferocious than Maud had been. She had a tongue, too, and before noon the  factory had Maud&rsquo;s history, and the history of Maud&rsquo;s mother, who, it appeared,  once cleaned skins at a sausage mill, and of Maud&rsquo;s father, who had to be  treated in gaol for a morbid habit of gathering bags of hens from other  people&rsquo;s roosts at unseemly hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; she cracks she&rsquo;s someone,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; wears asylum &rsquo;and-me-downs!&rdquo; squealed Jinny. &ldquo;What price pauper &rsquo;ats frim  the Ladies&rsquo; Beneverlent? Anyone kin put on dog when they cadges their rags frim  a bloomin&rsquo; institoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coffee Morgan plied her nimble  fingers, mumbling sourly all the time, only an occasional word or two like  &ldquo;scrougers,&rdquo; &ldquo;sooer rats,&rdquo; and &ldquo;low commonies&rdquo; being articulate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll fight yeh,&rdquo; yelled Thripny  defiantly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take it outer yeh, any day. Come &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;it me now, &rsquo;n&rsquo; y&rsquo;ll cop  yer doss in the Morgue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maud mumbled on, but kept out of  range. Thripny&rsquo;s demonstrations had cowed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So yeh loored him back with yer  pretty ways?&rdquo; said the packer to Coffee Morgan at lunch-time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How yer talk!&rdquo; growled Maud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Pride&rsquo;s true t&rsquo; yeh after  all. &lsquo;Come back,&rsquo; sez you, &lsquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; all will be fergot &rsquo;n&rsquo; forgave, &rsquo;n&rsquo; no  questions arst&rsquo;; &rsquo;n&rsquo; now he&rsquo;s yours for keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lad what&rsquo;s keepin&rsquo; co. with  me ain&rsquo;t got no use fer scrags, if that&rsquo;s what yer song&rsquo;s erbout,&rdquo; said Miss  Morgan, almost pertly.</p>
<p>Maud paid dearly for her triumph.  Jinny harried her in the factory with hard blows and bitter speech, and she  hunted her all the way home in pursuit of her vengeance. The sight of Thripny  tearing down Egg Lane after her enemy was a new joy for the lads at the butter  mart and the potato depot, and the &lsquo;hoys&rsquo; that resulted startled the town.</p>
<p>But another change came within a  week. Jinny bobbed up on Friday, radiant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twiz all a mistook,&rdquo; she said  joyfully to Feathers. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s true t&rsquo; me. Coffee&rsquo;s gone t&rsquo; the tip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bli&rsquo; me,&rdquo; said the packer,  &ldquo;Ned&rsquo;s a bit shifty, ain&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re pets now, me &rsquo;n&rsquo; him.  He&rsquo;s arst me t&rsquo; Snadger Halligan&rsquo;s darnce nex&rsquo; month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For four days Maud was terribly  depressed, and Jinny crowed over her without pity. Once Miss Morgan threw a  ladle of hot paste over Thripny, and once the pair fought a destructive  two-minute round in the lift corner, but there were many changes before Snadger  Halligan&rsquo;s dance came off. Coffee Morgan came into her own again, and was  deposed again. The fluctuations of feeling wrought by the mysterious unknown  awakened a hilarious interest amongst the Beauties, and the first question  every day was &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got him this mornin&rsquo;, Thripny?&rdquo; Through it all Maud and  Jinny remained bitterest enemies.</p>
<p>Thripny was in possession of the  vagrant fancy of the much beloved, and Snadger Halligan&rsquo;s dance was only two  nights off. Which would have him for the &lsquo;darnce&rsquo;? The Beauties were much  concerned, and betting was rife. Feathers was making a book on the event.</p>
<p>It was at lunch time. Feathers  was sitting on his own bench, finishing his bundle, when an unknown came up the  stairs. He was an under-sized, bullet-headed youth of about twenty-four, &ldquo;ez  plain ez a bottle iv pickled mussels,&rdquo; said the packer to his friend, the town  traveller, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; look-in&rsquo; like the cockie talker from a tuppeny push. He was  jist erbout class ernough t&rsquo; be a roustabout et a trainin&rsquo; stable fer dogs, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  he &rsquo;ad the sting-proof cheek iv a Scotch auctioneer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The stranger stopped at the top  of the stairs, put his hands to his mouth, and uttered the familiar call of the  early morning milkman. That identified him. Then he turned to the packer, and  said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a tom name iv Bitt workin&rsquo;  &rsquo;ere erbart, ain&rsquo;t yeh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Supposin&rsquo;?&rdquo; said the packer,  with his mouth full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s one of mine, tha&rsquo;s  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What-o, Billy-be-dam&rsquo;d, are you  it?&rdquo; said the packer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come orf, I&rsquo;m no it,&rdquo; answered  the lad. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m somethink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer dreamin&rsquo;,&rdquo; scoffed Feathers.</p>
<p>Thripny had heard the call. She  approached diffidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ello, Danny,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d&rsquo;  &rsquo;a&rsquo; thort?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s ther bit o&rsquo; stick,&rdquo; said  Danny to Feathers, and then he took Jinny aside, and for a few moments they  talked in low voices, but with increasing feeling, and from over bales and round  stacks the Beauties tittered and giggled at the prize boy who had kept Thripny  Bitt and Coffee Morgan at deadly enmity for a month past. Maud stood at a  little distance and glowered. It was presently seen that Danny and Miss Bitt  were not agreeing too well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s orf,&rdquo; said Danny; &ldquo;I thort  I&rsquo;d tell yeh it&rsquo;s O double F orf. This is the chuck fer yow, Sticks. I&rsquo;m  otherwise engaged fer the future. Yeh got smoogin&rsquo; up ter Gopher Eddie at the  Blondin, Chewsdee, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that&rsquo;s the last quarter. It&rsquo;s me takin&rsquo; Little  Bilk-street ter the darnce at Snadger&rsquo;s-Bilk-street! Put it in yer book. No  more fact&rsquo;ry rats for Danno.&rdquo; This was hurled at Maud, who was edging up. Dan  threw out his hand, edge on, and wreathed lip and nose contemptuously. &ldquo;No more  rats, d&rsquo; y&rsquo; &rsquo;ear? Both o&rsquo; yeh, when yer meets me next, &rsquo;ll get brusher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan had turned at the top of the  stairs to deliver the last salute, and a tornado of discarded lunch struck him,  and blotted him out. The Beauties considered &lsquo;fact&rsquo;ry rats&rsquo; an offensive  phrase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bilk-street!&rdquo; gasped Thripny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Liz Bricky,&rdquo; mumbled Miss  Morgan.</p>
<p>Thripny flew to the balusters,  and yelled abuse after Danny. Danny responded in kind as he passed down in a  shower of scraps. Mills gave him &lsquo;the order&rsquo; most offensively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gar-r-ut, cat&rsquo;s milk,&rdquo; cried  Miss Bitt. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be seen with your sort at a bottle-oh&rsquo;s garding party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrouger! Scrouger!&rdquo; mumbled  Coffee Morgan, spitting after the retreating lad. &ldquo;Who bit the pig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever speak t&rsquo; me agin &rsquo;n&rsquo; y&rsquo;ll  cop out,&rdquo; said Jinny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the John on ter yeh, that&rsquo;s what.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat&rsquo;s milk! Cat&rsquo;s milk!&rdquo; said  Maud, sullenly. She was not audible five yards off, but wished to keep her end  up.</p>
<p>Jinny had the last words, a  triumphant yell covering Dan with odium as a stealer of door mats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now yiv done yerselves in, both  iv yeh,&rdquo; said the packer. &ldquo;Hensforth, Danno&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y a cherished mem&rsquo;ry.  Bilk-street&rsquo;s got him clinched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our trubs!&rdquo; answered Thripny,  with terrible scorn. She wound a long, thin arm affectionately around Maud.  Maud responded in kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo; want nothink t&rsquo; do with low  larrikins like Danno, we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; mumbled Miss Morgan, and the two went down the  room, linked lovingly. The entente cordiale was restored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheManEater"></a>The Man-Eater</h2>
<p>Feathers&nbsp;christened  her the Man-Eater. The implication was that Porline was the counterpart of the  devilish adventuress in the popular melodrama, who consumes men with  undiminishable appetite. Porline was small, and so thin that her whole osseous  structure stood out like a skeleton in a bran sack; she was ugly, and no longer  young; her mere wisp of hair was drawn tight into a tiny knot at the top,  augmented with scraps of black ribbon; she had deeply-sunken beady, black eyes,  and her complexion, indeed, her whole binding, was leathery.</p>
<p>There was a painful cheerfulness  about Porline, an inexcusable skittishness that might have hurt finer  sensibilities than those common in the bag factory. She made an affectation of  being a devil of a fellow, which, taken in conjunction with her manifest  disabilities, was quite pitiful, but the hands did not see it in that light.</p>
<p>Her name, Pauline Streeton, would  have been a jarring note in the factory if it had been used there, but to  Spats&rsquo; Beatties she was always Porline or The Man-Eater, and Porline took no  exception to the nickname; on the contrary, she accepted it as a compliment to  her fatal powers of fascination, and even strained a point to live up to it.  Although she had been in the factory some years, nothing was known of Porline&rsquo;s  home life, but because she had little slang, and spoke fairly correct English&mdash;a  thing generally condemned by the Beauties as a beastly affectation&mdash;it was  whispered to all new-corners that the Man-Eater&rsquo;s family had been somebodies.  One romancer in a burst of recklessness asserted positively that Porline&rsquo;s  father was an Inspector of Police, but the factory held that there was a medium  in all things, and the idea perished of inanition.</p>
<p>Porline affected a youthful style  in frocks, and her hats had always a misplaced jauntiness; her feathers were  higher than any other girl&rsquo;s, and particularly vivid, and even at work, when  the Beauties discarded sleeves and collars, and all adornment, she loved to  flutter bits of cardinal ribbon, and generally wore a wilted artificial rose of  extreme redness in her sparse hair.</p>
<p>George H. Mills, alias Jud, alias  Feathers, the packer, was supposed to cherish a hopeless passion for Porline.  It was part of the poor comedy. Feathers maintained the pose without loss of  interest for some years, and Porline&rsquo;s archness towards the young man, according  to the opinion of the judicial Benno, was &ldquo;the sort iv thing t&rsquo; make er dorg  &rsquo;owl.&rdquo; She hung upon him, and turned saucy eyes up into his face, and giggled  heartlessly, remembering her part as the slayer. Feathers had a formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at &rsquo;er,&rdquo; he would say  appealingly to anybody or nobody, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t she ther sort what&rsquo;s fillin&rsquo; ther  river&rdquo; It&rsquo;s them eyes what does it. S&rsquo;elp me Jimmy Jee she&rsquo;s rooned my life!  Straight&mdash;she&rsquo;s draggin&rsquo; me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Porline would laugh  coquettishly, and skip away to her work. But she was lavish of her attentions,  and wasted no little time at Benno&rsquo;s desk, trying to bewitch him too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I wonder when I see you is  that there ain&rsquo;t more unhappy homes,&rdquo; said Benno. &ldquo;Porline, I&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin er  better man iv I&rsquo;d never set eyes on yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Billy the Boy, on the next flat,  murmured with deep feeling: &ldquo;Oh you little devil!&rdquo; as Porline went gaily  downstairs. The printers cried: &ldquo;Chase me, Charley!&rdquo; or affected a great  concern about mythical appointments, and the clerks in the warehouse, if the  eagle eye of Spats was not upon them, sighed deeply as she pranced in or out,  and addressed poetical raptures to the rafters. Whereat Porline smiled roguishly  upon all, and accented her girlishness of manner. She did everything with a  girly air that became grim burlesque in comparison with her years and  infirmities. Porline even tried her kittenish graces on the foreman, and had  once looked bewitchingly at the fat proprietor himself. Spats backed before the  glance like a man menaced by a python, pulled the lift rope with a perk, and  shot into the depth, whence he almost immediately sent an order demanding  Porline&rsquo;s instant dismissal. She was saved by Ellis, who assured the &ldquo;gov&rsquo;ner&rdquo;  of her harmlessness, and the more cogent fact that she was one of the most profitable  hands in the factory.</p>
<p>Tim Moore came to the flat one  morning in the capacity of assistant packer. He was a shy young exile of Erin,  new to Australia,  and the Beauties overwhelmed him. He worked with his back to them in a state of  nervous apprehension, and it was noticed that he had not lifted his eyes to the  ribald hussies at the pasting boards in a whole week. Porline showed no respect  for Tim&rsquo;s native reserve, however, but beset him with artful wheedling, like  the sly minx she affected to be, and poor Tim cowered before her attacks. The  woman&rsquo;s audacity, her boniness, her desiccated charms, and her ridiculous  pretensions in the matter of hair, threw him into a sort of helpless amazement.</p>
<p>Feathers was the first to offer a  kindly word of warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yer a young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;n&rsquo;  yeh ain&rsquo;t got no mother to advise yeh. Take my tip&mdash;pluck her out iv yer &rsquo;eart.&rdquo;  Tim cast a look of alarm towards Porline&rsquo;s board, and the packer dropped his  voice to an impressive whisper. &ldquo;We call her ther Man-Eater,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll  bring yeh sorrer &rsquo;n&rsquo; disgrace. Buck up&mdash;tear her himage from yer breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour or two later Benno,  primed by the packer, drifted from the room, and loitered at Tim&rsquo;s bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said gloomily, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re  to be her new victim. That&rsquo;s like her, castin&rsquo; her devilish wiles over ther  young an&rsquo; ther fair. We&rsquo;ve all yielded to her fatal fascination; her path is  strooed with ruined lives. Well, well, iv ther worst comes t&rsquo; ther worst, don&rsquo;t  say I never done me juty by yeh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tim&rsquo;s uneasiness developed into a  sort of superstitious awe. He watched Porline&rsquo;s comings and goings out of the  corner of his eyes, with a pathetic trepidation. In the afternoon, Goudy the  town traveller, when upstairs picking out an order, led Moore behind a stack of bales. His manner was  full of mystery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a siren,&rdquo; he said. Moore did not know what a  siren was, but he was impressed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got sons of my own, and think it only  right to speak ere it is too late. Let her get a hold upon you, and&mdash;&rdquo; Goudy  left the rest to Tim&rsquo;s imagination, but his gesture was eloquent of desolation  and despair.</p>
<p>Two hours later Tim stole over to  Feathers. &ldquo;D&rsquo;ye mind tellin&rsquo; me what&rsquo;s a sireen, at all&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one iv them things that  sings and sucks yer blood,&rdquo; answered the packer, with the readiness of an  expert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I t&rsquo;ought &rsquo;twas nothin&rsquo;  more&rsquo;n a bit iv a whistle.&rdquo; Tim allowed his eyes to turn cautiously in  Porline&rsquo;s direction. &ldquo;Goudy sez she&rsquo;s wan iv them sireens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers nodded gloomily. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s  bin the blight iv me young life,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The joke ended there, for when  Tim was missed from the flat half an hour later, it was found that he had taken  his hat and coat, and stolen off. He did not even return for his pay, and Goudy  heard that he shipped West by a boat that left on the following day. The flight  was a triumph for Porline. &ldquo;He told me another week iv it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;d &rsquo;a&rsquo; bin  yours body &rsquo;n&rsquo; soul,&rdquo; said the veracious Feathers. Benno confided to her that  he had seen Tim passionately kissing an artificial rose she had tossed to him.  Porline&rsquo;s middle-aged diablerie increased, and this success prompted her  crowning audacity. She came to the factory the on following Saturday, dressed  in her gayest, and leading by the hand a child of about three years of age, a  little girl, pretty and fresh as a flower, and caparisoned like the daughter of  a duchess. Spats&rsquo; Beauties were very partial to kiddies; they deserted their  paste boards in a body, and swarmed about the child, gushing rapturously,  praising its beauty with longing ecstasies, finding wonders in the tiniest  details of its dress, the blueness of its eyes, and the gold of its hair.  Porline lifted the little girl to the bench, that all might see, and her own  weird sapless ugliness, was in hurtful contrast with the sweetness of the  child, but her little, spotty eyes shone with joy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whose kiddy is it&rdquo; asked Martha,  the fat girl.</p>
<p>Porline looked round upon them  all. &ldquo;Whose should she be&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mine, of course. She&rsquo;s mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Beauties, if not particularly  keen on morals, were on the side of conventions in their initial impulses. They  drew off a step or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who&rsquo;s its mother, I mean&rdquo;  said Martha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m its mother,&rdquo; answered  Porline defiantly. &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;&mdash;she snapped her fingers like the bad female in the  drama&mdash;&rdquo;what do I care who knows&rdquo; Why shouldn&rsquo;t I acknowledge my child&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t  give that for your respectables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers pursed his mouth and  whistled a long tremolo. &ldquo;Well, iv she ain&rsquo;t a fair take-down!&rdquo; gasped Benno.  The Beauties did not seem to know what to do in the circumstances, so they laughed,  and drifted back to their boards, where they made calculations and compared  dates. Circumstantial evidence supported the claim of Porline; amazement  possessed the factory. Nobody would have believed it possible&mdash;everybody said  so.</p>
<p>For a time there was some little  inclination to hold off from Porline&rsquo;s kiddy, but the child&rsquo;s winsomeness  dissipated all pruderies, and the hands would have killed it with kindness had  not Porline shown herself as alert and scrupulous as a mothering hen; but the  pride she felt in her child lit her up like an inward light, and she paraded  the proof of her paganism with a flaunting audacity. The news went through the  establishment in a matter of minutes. The printers came up in a procession to  see Porline&rsquo;s &ldquo;illegim&rdquo;; the clerks, one after another, found excuse for a  visit to the top flat. The fat, bald ledger-keeper, bowed his head upon a stack  of nine-pound browns, and sobs shook his frame. The fat ledger-keeper was an  instinctive comedian. He had given it out far and wide that Porline was his  secret sorrow. All the men reproached Porline, mutely, or with the speech of  desolated hearts. Ellis, the dusty foreman, was stunned; hours later he stopped  to whisper to Feathers, with the air of a man who&rsquo;s missed the point of a story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she mean the young un&rsquo;s  really hers&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure pop,&rdquo; answered the packer.  &ldquo;Hers fer keeps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The foreman clicked his tongue  for half a minute, looking like a mazed hen. &ldquo;I been in the thick of &rsquo;em here  fer more&rsquo;n twenty-five year,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an&rsquo; my opinion is girls is mad more &rsquo;r  less most times by reason of the nature of &rsquo;em, but I&rsquo;d never &rsquo;a&rsquo; suspected  anythin&rsquo; o&rsquo; the like o&rsquo; that of &rsquo;er.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d never &rsquo;a&rsquo; suspected it iv  any man,&rdquo; said Feathers.</p>
<p>Having recovered from his great  wonder, the packer resumed the thread of his long joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeh might &rsquo;a&rsquo; broke it to er  bloke gently, Porline,&rdquo; he murmured dolefully. &ldquo;Iv yeh, can&rsquo;t return ther  haffections iv one what worships ther very old slippers yeh work in, there&rsquo;s no  call t&rsquo; go laceratin&rsquo; his &rsquo;eart. Girl, girl, ain&rsquo;t yeh got no &rsquo;uman instincts&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fritters!&rdquo; cried Porline  vivaciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t yeh be true t&rsquo; one what  loves yeh fer yerself alone&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a dozen,&rdquo; said Porline.</p>
<p>Feathers wiped away the tears  with which he had sprinkled hisface in preparation for the scene. &ldquo;Leave me t&rsquo;  me grief,&rdquo; he &ldquo;Let me sorrer make me sacred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porline went off jauntily in her  character of the heartless foreign female out of the third act, and Feathers  stole down for his daily beer like a man driven to it.</p>
<p>After that Porline often brought  little Kitty to the factory. The Beauties made a toy of the pretty child, and  presently the astonishment passed, and Porline&rsquo;s motherhood was accepted  without remark. The woman was an Ishmaelite, she had no relatives to consider,  and keeping no society, was bound to no social observances. How she behaved  within the law was her own affair; the factory at least pressed no demands.</p>
<p>One week, about two months after  the first appearance of the child at Spats&rsquo;, Porline absented herself from work  three days running. She returned on the Friday, coming in late, and the factory  gasped at the sight of her. She was changed as if by a visitation, all her  jauntiness was gone, she was hopelessly old and withered, the leathery tan had  gone from her cheeks, and the folded skin was yellow and blotched, her  red-lidded eyes were rimmed with purple&mdash;she looked like death in a feathered  hat.</p>
<p>She passed through the girls,  without a word, deaf to their inquiries. The packer&rsquo;s joke died on his lips. At  her board she worked fiercely, wrapping herself up in the task, and the  Beauties looked at her and at each other, and whispered conjectures. Fat Martha  worked at the same table, but it was not till an hour and a half had passed  that she dared put the question that had been on her lips all along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is it somethin&rsquo; wrong with  Kitty, Porline&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Porline turned on her savagely,  raising her brush to strike. &ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo; she cried shrilly. Her voice  sank almost to a whisper. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t&mdash;can&rsquo;t you see I&rsquo;m dying&rdquo; Her head fell amongst  the paper before her, and then she slid to the floor, and lay grovelling, and  the sobs that convulsed her beat her face upon the boards until it bled.</p>
<p>The girls rushed about her. Some  tried to lift her from the floor, but she beat them off, and lay there writhing  in a passion of grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Kitty,&rdquo; she said presently.  &ldquo;My Kitty, my baby, my beautiful Kitty. They have taken her from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, dear&rdquo; asked the fat girl,  sobbing in sympathy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her mother. I took her when she  was a tiny mite, and her own mother was afraid to have her, and she said I  could keep her always, and I paid to have her nursed, and I dressed her in all  the prettiest things I could buy, and I loved her&mdash;I loved her, and she is gone.  They have taken her&mdash;my baby! my baby!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Porline struck her bare hands  upon the floor, and lying upon her face in the dust, abandoned herself to a  grief that was tragic&mdash;profound as the human heart&mdash;and the Beauties, who caught  up emotions as the trees take the winds, cried over her in a woeful chorus.</p>
<p>Feathers broke away, and staring  at Benno, and pushing his hands before him, he said brokenly: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beat! I&rsquo;m  beat! Fer God&rsquo;s sake come &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;ave er drink I&rsquo;m fair beat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="AQuestionofPropriety"></a>A Question of Propriety</h2>
<p>There was&nbsp;something  amiss; the crowded factory room was quick with the sense of it. A stranger  coming up the stairs might have been visited with a consciousness of the fact  that the spirit of mischief was stirring on the top flat. Spats&rsquo; Beauties,  girls of a kind commonly given to rebellious and frivolous practices, had  preserved for over an hour the decorum of a superior young ladies&rsquo; seminary  under a Presbyterian regime.</p>
<p>The foreman clawed his fuzzy  hair, and showed a cowering back. The quiet was ominous. Nothing was heard but  the whir and whiz of the machines, the fluttering of busy hands in paper, and a  sibilant whispering peculiarly viperish. Spats&rsquo; girls did not usually whisper;  their ordinary conversation was shrill and over-bearing, and there were at  least eighty of them, young and old. Factory girls, like those of the ballet,  remain &ldquo;girls&rdquo; in defiance of time and the ravages thereof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo; &lsquo;s wrong, Feathers&rdquo; Billy  the Boy, the juvenile rouseabout from the printers&rsquo; flat, who had crept up the  stairs, thrust an inky stub of a nose through the battens, and cocked an  anxious eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get t&rsquo; &rsquo;ell outer this!&rdquo; said  the packer, throwing a ball of twine. The day was oppressive, and the packer&rsquo;s  attempt to steal out for a pint of consolation had been stalled off at the lift  door by the boss, and he was feeling wronged and vindictive.</p>
<p>Billy whipped down on a banister  at the peril of his neck, and called softly upwards:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yer love me, Carrie,  dontcher, spite o&rsquo; me boil&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone had a tender pathos  touched with passion. It stirred the packer to black wrath. Leaning over the  open space by the stairs, he promised Billy death with barbaric effects.  Feathers was liable to boils, and was also a man of a philandering temperament.  The printer&rsquo;s devils were in the habit of deliberately hearing things in the  cellar among the bales when the girls were being let out after over-time.</p>
<p>Billy was deeply moved; he  smeared ink on the rope with which Feathers swung parcels to the shop flat, and  resumed the ordinary evasion of his duties as a devil.</p>
<p>The majority of the girls worked  at square boards on trestles. There was a heap of paste in the centre of each  board, and the piece-workers stood to their task, pasting and folding at the  terraced stacks of stationery with the dexterity of machines, bare-armed,  bare-necked, in slovenly gowns caked with dirt-colored dough, their tousled  hair powdered with the fibre of the paper. One girl worked alone. There was a  drift from her neighbourhood, but sidelong glances assailed her with  accusations; the tittering that occasionally broke out was all for her ears,  and it was suppressed with a malicious understanding that she would recognise  the suppression to be a measure of consideration extended to a transgressor.</p>
<p>The creature apart was a sallow,  freckled girl, with pale hair and sharp features. She was fully conscious of  what was going on&mdash;had felt some symptoms of it working for weeks, but to-day  the devilment was pointed and deliberate. The hot oppression of the top flat  had wrought upon the Beauties, and Annie Mack was sacrificed to the necessity  for diversion. From a purely moral point of view the factory had no particular  qualms about Miss Mack&rsquo;s weaknesses.</p>
<p>There was a sullen stupidity in  Annie&rsquo;s face; she raced her work; her hands flashed along the automatic  movements of a set task; the perspiration ran down her long neck. This  energetic action was the only relief, and the girl&rsquo;s consolation would come in  a fat packet on Saturday, she being a piece-worker.</p>
<p>Benno loitered at the packer&rsquo;s  bench for a word. Our Mr. Dickson, it must not be forgotten, was a superior  creature&mdash;he reigned on a high stool at a desk in a top corner near the cutters,  piling figures on figures all day long. He came at nine, after the others, and  left at half-past five, before the others, and had become shockingly lop-eared  as a result of his practice of carrying a long pen behind his ear to assert his  dignity. Benno as a clerk should have held status with the young gentlemen down  in the warehouse if people had their rights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re settin&rsquo; her nibs  t&rsquo;-day,&rdquo; said Benno, with a sportsman&rsquo;s keenness, a sidewise convulsion of his  features indicating Annie.</p>
<p>Feathers finished a knot with  some deliberation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dunno what they&rsquo;re gettin&rsquo; at,&rdquo;  he said. His air was that of a man with a mild grievance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;out, man! mean t&rsquo; say yeh  ain&rsquo;t took a tumble&rdquo; Benno had his own opinion of such mental denseness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, iv you&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course&mdash;weeks ago. Ain&rsquo;t yeh got  eyes in yer &rsquo;ead&rdquo;</p>
<p>A harsh voice barked behind them.  Benno fled to his high stool. Feathers banged his ream industriously, and  Odgson, the Gov&rsquo;ner, otherwise Spats, snarled and glowered for a few minutes,  like an angry dog. Spats was rarely articulate. After scrutinising his Beauties  under the rim of his belltopper, overlooking the room in the attitude of an  avenging Fate, the Gov&rsquo;ner drifted down stairs again. He had been disturbed in  his den below by the ominous silence aloft.</p>
<p>Billy the Boy reappeared under  the banister, grinning maliciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Copped out that trip, didn&rsquo;t  yeh! Up to yeh, too, fer a dead nark.&rdquo; The &ldquo;office&rdquo; should have come from Billy  the Boy. Feathers took him on the nose with a treacherous jerk of the twine  ball, and the devil retreated to the first landing, whence he sent up shrill  whisperings to remind the packer of his lowly birth, and his many defects of  character and education. &ldquo;Anyhow, thank Gawd, &rsquo;twasn&rsquo;t my old mother stole the  boots!&rdquo; said Billy.</p>
<p>The hush imposed by the great  man&rsquo;s presence passed, the voices hissed again; and Annie bent to her task. Her  face was to her enemies. She increased her pace. She had listened so long, and  at such a strain that now the whole room buzzed in her head like a big bee.</p>
<p>Miss Kruse, the ever depressed  elderly maiden, nominally forewoman, felt the electrical condition of the  atmosphere, and, knowing her helplessness in the face of a combination of the  bigger girls, devoted herself to the kids at the folding-boards, casting sulky,  underhand glances at the others, and wearing the piteous expression of an  ill-used woman on her flat face. Ellis, boss of the flat, who had retired  behind his guillotines, shot his head over the machines every now and again,  and nervously surveyed the room. Being mortally afraid of the girls, anything  like a display of insubordination threw the lathy man into a state of imbecile  distress.</p>
<p>The long day wore on to half-past  four, and there was no outbreak. Ellis prayed for 6 o&rsquo;clock. With marvellous  cunning he had approached Miss Mack, hinting at illness, and mildly advising  bed and a brand of pills much appreciated in the factory. Diplomacy was Fuzzy&rsquo;s  strong point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Set a trap in yer &rsquo;at, you&rsquo;ve  got rats!&rdquo; responded the young lady, bitterly, and though the foreman revolved  for a few minutes agitatedly expostulating, after that she treated him as  something extinct.</p>
<p>Work had been Annie&rsquo;s  safety-valve. While running at high pressure she could contain herself, but now  came a break. Her paste was used up, and to get more she must turn her back to  the foe and pass down a long flat to the corner where the coppers were. She  went with resolution. Simultaneously with her disappearance, there was a burst  of uproar in the factory, loud conversation, calls, badinage, and laughter; the  flat roared with its characteristic babel.</p>
<p>The moment Annie reappeared the  racket sank to a sibilant murmuring once more. The girl walked erect, with tight  drawn lips and fiery eyes, carrying the dipper of steaming paste in her hand.  She came to the packer&rsquo;s bench, where Benno stood talking business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty-six iv nine pound brown,&rdquo;  said Feathers.</p>
<p>Annie saw the heads together, and  suddenly her restraint collapsed. She turned upon the men, her whole person  animate with passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a lyin&rsquo; &rsquo;ound!&rdquo; she  yelled.</p>
<p>Feathers got the whole dipper of  hot paste full in his face. The stuff half choked him; it clung in his hair, it  rolled down his neck, it deluged him. He slid down into a pool of it, and  blinked up at his assailant in pitiable amazement, a ludicrous object smoking  on the floor, no longer a man, but a clammy mass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An&rsquo; I never said a word!&rdquo; he  protested weakly. &ldquo;S&rsquo; &rsquo;elp me, I never said a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Annie Mack was otherwise  engaged. She flamed upon the factory. Rage possessed her. She was crammed with  hatred, and it flew from her in language that shot terror into her enemies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave it t&rsquo; Benno, there. Now,  come, what &rsquo;d I say&rdquo; cried Feathers, virtuously pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Flamin&rsquo;, blazin&rsquo; liars!&rdquo; cried  Annie. &ldquo;You tork about me&mdash;you&mdash;you! You orter! A pack o&rsquo; rats. What&rsquo;re yer  gotter say &rsquo;bout me&rdquo; Spit it out!&rdquo; She stood with up lifted hands and screamed  at them, and then her eye picked out an individual. &ldquo;You, Kitty Conroy, call me  things, will yeh&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dashed at Kitty, and fastened  on her like a fury, all claws. &ldquo;Fight me, yeh waster!&rdquo; she shrieked, tearing at  the other&rsquo;s hair.</p>
<p>Kitty fought back with spirit.  Crash went her board and on it rolled the combatants, fighting like tykes  amongst the paste and the papers. They clawed, and tore, and punched, screaming  incessantly, turning over and over in the mess. Annie arose from the fray  half-blinded, pasted from head to foot, and garnished with fruit-bags. She rushed  into the thick of her enemies. The girls screamed, and broke before her in  terror, and havoc followed in her wake. She tore down the tables, she filled  the air with paste and myriads of envelopes, storms of stationery broke out  whenever she paused a moment, and the unhappy girl that fell into her hands was  reft of hair and draperies, and blackened with bruises. The distracted foreman  danced on the outskirts of the riot, shedding real tears, and appealing in  heart-rending accents alternately to Annie and to high heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Mack! Miss Mack, for pity&rsquo;s  sake!&rdquo; He became valiant in his great perturbation, and threw himself in  Annie&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>Snatching up a small tub of  paste, she smashed it over the foreman&rsquo;s head, leaving him with a necklace of  hoops, and in a smother of his own composition. In that awful moment, Ellis  bitterly regretted his attempts to improve the consistency of good flour paste  with common glue.</p>
<p>Sis Twentyman was the next  victim, but she escaped, leaving a wisp of hair in Annie&rsquo;s hands, and took  refuge behind her table, and Miss Mack chased her round it five times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give yeh whisperin&rsquo; an&rsquo;  tisperin&rsquo;,&rdquo; cried Annie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tear the eyes out of yer monkey face, you pig&rsquo;s  sister. What &rsquo;re you, to go whisperin&rsquo; about people! What &rsquo;re you, more&rsquo;n a  half Chow&rdquo; She paused for breath, and a fierce resolution shone in her eyes.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do yeh, though! I&rsquo;ll do yeh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie darted to the  dressing-room, and presently reappeared, brandishing something with the triumph  of a scalp-hunting savage. It was Sis Twentyman&rsquo;s new hat she held aloft&mdash;the  beautiful confection Sis had introduced only that morning&mdash;the most precious  thing in all the world. &ldquo;See,&rdquo; cried Annie-&rdquo;See, you dirty stop-out!&rdquo; She  placed the hat on the floor and danced wildly amongst the feathers.</p>
<p>Sis uttered a yell of mortal  agony, and, heedless of danger, dashed in to the rescue; but with her foot  still upon the crown, Annie tore the hat to fragments, and flung them in Sis&rsquo;s  face, and the two girls fastened on each other after the manner of cats.</p>
<p>A number of the printers had come  to Benno&rsquo;s assistance by this time. They parted the combatants, and Annie  relapsed into hysterics. She was carried to the dressing-room, and Fuzzy  followed after with the Gov&rsquo;ner, who had just arrived on the scene, snapping  orders.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later Annie  Mack came forth, clothed in her right mind, and stole down the stairs. It was  understood that she had been discharged, and her foes were appeased, but order  was not restored in the factory that day, nor the next.</p>
<p>One afternoon, some nine weeks  later, Annie re-visited the top flat, proudly carrying a long-coated baby about  three weeks of age. Annie was gaily dressed, and the infant&rsquo;s gown was worked  to a point of extravagance. The girl smiled cheerfully on all, just as if  nothing had happened, sailing through the room, a vision of happiness. She bore  no malice for the mischief she had wrought. Annie submitted her baby to Miss  Kruse&rsquo;s approval with beaming confidence. Curiosity overcame the others, and  they gathered round to inspect and applaud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t he a bute&rdquo; said Annie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little love!&rdquo; said Kitty  Conroy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The darlin&rsquo;!&rdquo; gasped Bell  Oliver.</p>
<p>The girls flattered and gushed.  Sis Twentyman kissed the baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course you know I&rsquo;m married&rdquo;  said Annie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried Bell. &ldquo;Was that lately&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless yeh, no!&rdquo; answered  Annie&mdash;&ldquo;a week ago!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheHauntedCorner"></a>The Haunted Corner</h2>
<p>The Packer&nbsp;was  entertaining Pepper Ned, from Whimble&rsquo;s pickle mill, in the Wharf-side bar.  There were threepenny beers and spring-onions lunch, and the talk had taken a  scientific turn, it bore upon molecular disturbances of the atmosphere, set up  by the popular esculent, and the carrying power of certain breeds of onions, on  all of which matters Pepper discoursed oracularly as an expert. The young man  from the pickle mill was reminded of the pathetic case of one Artie Coutts, a  sensitive soul who had been driven by stress of circumstances and the  unfortunate remissness of his people at Home in the matter of remittances, to  take service at Whimbles and who had become obsessed by onions in the course of  a few weeks. It seemed that Artie was a man whose natural refinement had  survived a demoralizing weakness that sacrificed everything else for whisky of  Scotch extraction, and fate threw him into that department of the factory where  the onions were flayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; me lord juke fair stooed in  atter iv onyins,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Ev&rsquo;ry one else got &rsquo;ardened t&rsquo; ther hum iv onyins,  but Artie he never cud. It fair turned him up, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;d go er pale pea-green  when er bunch iv busy girls got er rush on er ton iv young uns&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; th&rsquo;  ink-pink began t&rsquo; rattle ther windows, &rsquo;n&rsquo; push ther slates off ther roof.  Youse don&rsquo;t know what ther little pickle onyin&rsquo;s capable of till yev met er ton  of &rsquo;em stripped fer bizness in a &rsquo;ot room. Artie began t&rsquo; look like er man with  er settled sorrer after er week of it. &lsquo;My Gord! my Gord!&rsquo; he used t&rsquo; say,  slappin&rsquo; his bald &rsquo;ead with his two &rsquo;ands, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s t&rsquo; become iv me?&rsquo; &rsquo;N&rsquo; then  he&rsquo;d sneak er gulp of whisky, &rsquo;n&rsquo; face it agin like a &rsquo;ero. I &rsquo;eard afterwards  that he got a sort iv idea how he was &rsquo;aunted by ther concentrated hodor iv  Whimble&rsquo;s onyin branch. He took it &rsquo;ome with him. It follered him everywhere.  He couldn&rsquo;t shake it. He took &rsquo;t sprintin&rsquo; in ther streets, thinkin&rsquo; t&rsquo; outrun  it &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;ide where it couldn&rsquo;t find him, &rsquo;n&rsquo; twice he was run in fer gallopin  wild through ther city without his &rsquo;at, &rsquo;n&rsquo; with ther light iv madness in his  eye, thinkin&rsquo; in his addled &rsquo;ead how he was makin&rsquo; er break from ther orful  smell iv Whimble&rsquo;s. Then he took t&rsquo; shriekin&rsquo; out iv nights when he woke &rsquo;n&rsquo;  found th&rsquo; &rsquo;orrid hodor in his room, &rsquo;n&rsquo; flier people &rsquo;ud find him crouched down  in one corner in his nightie, tremblin&rsquo; all over, &rsquo;n&rsquo; moanin&rsquo; erbout ther  purple &rsquo;n&rsquo; green smells what was comin&rsquo; at him down ther chimbley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said they was some nine foot  high,&rdquo; continued Ned, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; they was breathin&rsquo; pestilent fumes on him, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he  couldn&rsquo;t get no sleep fer ther noise they made trampin&rsquo; erbout in ther  &rsquo;obnailed boots. Then came a Sunday when he went out on ther roof in his shirt,  explodin&rsquo; the lan&rsquo;lord&rsquo;s gun, &rsquo;n&rsquo; when ther p&rsquo;lice pulled &rsquo;im down, he said he  was shootin&rsquo; ther big, red onions with livid eyes, what was comin&rsquo; down in  millyins &rsquo;n&rsquo; millyins t&rsquo; stifle ther town. They put poor Artie in er padded  cell, but ther smell gave him no peace, &rsquo;n he died of it eventual, sayin&rsquo; he  was&mdash;t&rsquo; &rsquo;ell, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;ell was er pickle fact&rsquo;ry, jist like Whimble&rsquo;s, where the  scent iv onions without end rolled over ther souls iv ther damned fer ever &rsquo;n&rsquo;  ever, amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers was deeply impressed by  the story of Artie. He sipped his beer with a thoughtful air. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said,  &ldquo;I kin understan&rsquo; that lad bein&rsquo; &rsquo;aunted by a nodor. I&rsquo;ve known ther time when  I&rsquo;ve thort there was somethin&rsquo; spooky &rsquo;n&rsquo; soopernatural erbout er pertickler  weird &rsquo;n&rsquo; unaccountable erfluvium, &rsquo;n&rsquo; wasn&rsquo;t ther on&rsquo;y one, ther whole  bloomin&rsquo; fact&rsquo;ry got er bit ratty erbout it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; was thinkin&rsquo; iv givin&rsquo; ther  grip brusher, &rsquo;n&rsquo; going&rsquo; inter Co. with ther unemployed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wharf-labourers, and the  sailor-men, and the hands from Egg    Lane drew their beer about the packer. Feathers  had some reputation as a yarn spinner. His low-comedy style was popular and it  was admitted that with education and opportunity he might have become  eminent&mdash;he might even have aspired to be an auctioneer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spats&rsquo; fact&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s got er bend in  it, yeh know, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;twas round in ther west corner be ther lift well we first  got up agin that &lsquo;whoof&rsquo;,&rdquo; continued the packer. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas er mos&rsquo; curious  ink-pink sorter unearthly&mdash;ther kinder thing yeh might expect t&rsquo; biff yeh in  ther feelin&rsquo;s when ther trap lid iv ther bottomless is lifted t&rsquo; hadmit one  more dead &rsquo;ead t&rsquo; ther pit. For er few days it loitered round there, gatherin&rsquo;  force, &rsquo;n&rsquo; preparin&rsquo; fer ther attack, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that part iv ther buildin&rsquo; became  very unpop&rsquo;lar. Fuzzy, ther foreman, went down with reports ev&rsquo;ry arf hour &rsquo;r  so, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther new smell created er good deal iv talk. His gills would come  battlin&rsquo; down ther flat, full iv bisness &rsquo;n&rsquo; good intentions, ez he always is,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; butt up agin ther new flavour, what was takin&rsquo; on fresh developments each  day, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;d fetch up, &rsquo;n&rsquo; sniff round &rsquo;n&rsquo; round, like er startled terrier,  with er new idear erbout rats. Then he&rsquo;d claw up his bunch iv cobwebs, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  sample her agin. Then he&rsquo;d say: &lsquo;Seems t&rsquo; me they&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; a bit queer,  George &rsquo;Enery&rsquo;; &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;d paw erbout, &rsquo;n&rsquo; scratch &rsquo;n&rsquo; dig ermong ther stacks iv  bags &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther cuttin&rsquo;s &rsquo;n&rsquo; stuff, more like er terrier &rsquo;n&rsquo; ever. Lummie! I used  t&rsquo; wonder ther beggar didn&rsquo;t bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers moistened his lips with  two-thirds of a long-sleever, and Pepper Ned leaned on his pint, and sighed  heavily. The interval between drinks promised to be protracted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, them hatmospheric &rsquo;ints  grew more pointed. &rsquo;n&rsquo; presently they began t&rsquo; clamour. They crep&rsquo; down on ther  pasters, &rsquo;n&rsquo; eventual they raided Fuzzy&rsquo;s end, &rsquo;n&rsquo; drifted out into ther street  t&rsquo; disturb ther traffic. It was midsummer, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she raised her voice to er yell,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther whole fam&rsquo;ly iv hodors jined in ther chorus. By&rsquo;n bye she was  screamin&rsquo; perlice &rsquo;n&rsquo; blue murder, &rsquo;n&rsquo; you couldn&rsquo;t hear a bloomin&rsquo; iron tank drop  above ther general din &rsquo;n&rsquo; hodoref&rsquo;rousness. Down comes Fuzzy, &rsquo;n&rsquo; whacks into  it agin, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he gives er sad cry, &rsquo;n&rsquo; drops his bundle, &rsquo;n&rsquo; goes pluckin&rsquo; et  his &rsquo;air, &rsquo;n&rsquo; bedevillin&rsquo; his whisks, &rsquo;n&rsquo; barkin&rsquo; his bleedin&rsquo; shins over  things, &rsquo;n&rsquo; comin&rsquo; up out iv ther tangle presently, wet &rsquo;n&rsquo; dusty, &rsquo;n&rsquo; pale ez  death, with one &rsquo;and pressed on his &lsquo;Darby Kell&rsquo;. &rsquo;n&rsquo; the other holdin&rsquo; himself  down, &lsquo;n&rsquo;, &lsquo;George &rsquo;Enery,&rsquo; he sez, petulant like, &lsquo;they must be a leak,&rsquo; sez  he. Er leak! Mother iv Moses! &rsquo;twas more like er Niagarer or er barrel iv  litherfracture bustin&rsquo; in er condemned graveyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Er leak!&rsquo; I sez, &lsquo;I think &rsquo;er  whale&rsquo;s gone bad on ther firm&rsquo;s &rsquo;ands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Can&rsquo;t yeh do somethin&rsquo;?&rsquo; wails  he, more in sorrow than in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked t&rsquo; be excused fer me old  mother&rsquo;s sake, me not havin&rsquo; a sound &rsquo;eart. &lsquo;Send fer ther Board iv Health &rsquo;n&rsquo;  ther corporation shifters iv detestable objects,&rsquo; I sez; &lsquo;I ain&rsquo;t no dealer in  remains.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Somethin&rsquo; must be done,&rsquo;  whimpers Fuzzy, very pitiful. &lsquo;Somethin&rsquo; mus&rsquo; be done;&rsquo; &rsquo;n&rsquo; he makes ernother  break, &rsquo;n&rsquo; spills over er tub iv paste, &rsquo;n&rsquo; nex&rsquo; minit he&rsquo;s giggin round ermong  ther Beauts, tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; bustle &rsquo;em inter takin&rsquo; on ther job iv searchin&rsquo; fer  ther disturbin&rsquo; element, &rsquo;n&rsquo; removin&rsquo; it beyond ther city limits. Ther toms  bucked like mules. Kitty Coudray said she was wanted &rsquo;ome, th&rsquo; &rsquo;ouse being  afire, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Rickards &rsquo;n&rsquo; nine others guv him er week&rsquo;s notice with their  compliments, but some iv ther wages &rsquo;ands took it on; &rsquo;n&rsquo; presently there was  er procession iv pale, sick girls on ther stairs goin&rsquo; &rsquo;ome t&rsquo; bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, that strange,  houtlandish smell was reachin&rsquo; out &rsquo;n&rsquo; developin&rsquo;, same ez Goatie&rsquo;s candle mill  with ther lid off, &rsquo;n&rsquo; our foreman was gettin&rsquo; so worked up he couldn&rsquo;t sleep  iv nights. Ther toadstools &rsquo;n&rsquo; things was growin&rsquo; on that pale blue hodour in  ther &rsquo;aunted corner like mussels on er mudbarge, &rsquo;n&rsquo; et this point up comes his  gills, ther junior partner, Duff, come on er voyage iv discovery &rsquo;n&rsquo; in er  spirit iv scientific inquiry. &rsquo;Twas his juty t&rsquo; hinvestergate &rsquo;n&rsquo; draw up er  report. He tried samples from nine points iv view, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then he looked tired,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; withdrew frim ther commission, holdin&rsquo; affectionately to his wishbone, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  mutterin&rsquo; like er man in er dream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther respected proprietor, His  Whiskers, was disgusted with what he called this heffeminate weakness on ther  part iv Suety, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he &rsquo;eaded fer ther shockin&rsquo; outbreak on his own. Bizness was  suspended on ther spot, every eye was on Odgson. He passed me with his &rsquo;ead up,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; his nose high, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his cady balanced on ther bridge iv it. He came into  collision with ther thick end iv ther distressin&rsquo; event unexpected, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it took  his breath erway. He sorter bounced off it. But ther boss is Scotch and  stubborn. He put his &rsquo;ead down, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ducked in, &rsquo;n&rsquo; fer arf er minit there was  er catch-ez-cats-can contest &rsquo;tween him &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther reek iv after judgement, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  His Whiskers was beat. He come up out iv it, lookin&rsquo; white &rsquo;n&rsquo; weak, leavin&rsquo;  his bell-topper in ther possession iv th&rsquo; enemy, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he leaned &rsquo;eavily on my  board &rsquo;n&rsquo; breathed hard. Presently he called t&rsquo; Ellis in er weak voice, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  Fuzzy come stumpin down ther aisle, cryin&rsquo; &lsquo;Yessir! Yessir!&rsquo; every stride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Huh, dammit all, man, what&rsquo;s  yonder?&rsquo; sez Odgson, speakin&rsquo; like er man who&rsquo;s jist done his &rsquo;undred yards in  ten secs.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I&rsquo;m erfraid it&rsquo;s er leak, sir,&rsquo;  stammers Fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Er leak, yeh idjit!&rsquo; yells  Spats &lsquo;Are none iv ther girls missin&rsquo;? Then he turns t&rsquo; me. &lsquo;Come back t&rsquo;night,  Mills,&rsquo; sez he, &lsquo;you &rsquo;n&rsquo; Don, ther carter, &rsquo;n&rsquo; shift those bales. &rsquo;Unt it out!  &lsquo;Unt it out!&rsquo; I had t&rsquo; do it &rsquo;r resign me grip on ther spot, &rsquo;n&rsquo; blime if he  didn&rsquo;t send me in fer his &rsquo;at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot er night we &rsquo;ad&mdash;Jimmy Jee,  wot er night! Fuzzy pegged out after ther first hour, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther Don &rsquo;n&rsquo; me  shifted bales &rsquo;n&rsquo; stacks, &rsquo;n&rsquo; ate dust, &rsquo;n tainted our himmortal bloomin&rsquo; souls  with the hum of old Tophet, &rsquo;n&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; come iv it &rsquo;septin&rsquo; ther discovery iv  er mysterfyin&rsquo; noise wot cud be &rsquo;eard when leaned up agin ther wall in ther  &rsquo;aunted corner. Er creepy, unaccountable kinder noise, like ther faint, far off  tickin&rsquo; iv er clock shop. We tried t&rsquo; track it down, but couldn&rsquo;t. It seemed t&rsquo;  come outer ther bricks. That was more ghostly than ther smell, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it started  my thatch walkin&rsquo; tiptoe all over me napper, though I ain&rsquo;t ther man t&rsquo; take  long odds erbout ghosts happenin&rsquo; up anywheres &rsquo;r anyhow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When ther Beauts got onter that  mystery tickin&rsquo; erway in the wall then ther plot thickened. You couldn&rsquo;t get  one iv &rsquo;em back, fer night work fer gold &rsquo;n&rsquo; di&rsquo;monds, &rsquo;n&rsquo; they shied from ther  &rsquo;aunted corner in ther shades iv evenin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; still ther odour grew, so et life  wasn&rsquo;t worth livin&rsquo; up on ther top flat. There was talks iv er general strike,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; er bunch iv ther pasters interviewed Odgson, &rsquo;n&rsquo; pointed out how they&rsquo;d  wanter be paid time &rsquo;n&rsquo; er half t&rsquo; carry on ther firm&rsquo;s bizness in ther  supernatural hatmosphere what was prevailin&rsquo; upstairs. Neighbourin&rsquo; firms was  complainin&rsquo; bitterly, &rsquo;n&rsquo; people was cryin&rsquo; out in the street, sayin&rsquo; Spats&rsquo;  biz otter come under ther head iv noxious trades, &rsquo;n&rsquo; be shifted out inter ther  tannery &rsquo;n&rsquo; glue mill district. This stirred the boss up, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he got in workmen  t&rsquo; punch er hole in ther wall &rsquo;n&rsquo; locate that spook odour, imaginin&rsquo; ther queer  tickin&rsquo; might be ther furious smell gnawin&rsquo; its way inter ther buildin&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er gang was on ther job for four  days, goin&rsquo; inter ther hinfected arear in shifts iv short dooration, one man  down th&rsquo; other come on, but, blime, they discovered nothink. They broke &rsquo;oles  in ther wall, but ther mystery never shifted, ther tickin&rsquo; went on just ther  same, &rsquo;a&rsquo; ther erfluvium become more &rsquo;n&rsquo; more denser. The Board iv &rsquo;Ealth was  warned be this, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it come down, &rsquo;n&rsquo; stood round, wearin&rsquo; little patent  respirators, &rsquo;n&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; wise, but it couldn&rsquo;t do nothin&rsquo; towards solvin&rsquo; ther  problem, so after measurin&rsquo; ther density iv ther smell with scientific  hinstruments, &rsquo;n&rsquo; takin&rsquo; its longertude &rsquo;n lattertude, &rsquo;n&rsquo; selectin&rsquo; some  samples fer analysis, it went down, &rsquo;n&rsquo; gave Spats legal notice t&rsquo; have ther  tincture iv fiends removed frim his premises within three days, &rsquo;r suffer ther  hextreme penalty iv ther law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that smell got inter ther  papers. Ther evenin&rsquo; organ was quite excited erbout it, &rsquo;n&rsquo; spoke iv it ez er  marvellous fernomenon, goin&rsquo; on t&rsquo; say how Spats was evidently ther centre iv  some new manifestation iv natural forces, &rsquo;n&rsquo; callin&rsquo; on ther Govment t&rsquo; pass  er Act iv Parliament without delay. Er perfessor writ er wonderful letter,  sayin&rsquo; proberly the eruption was due t&rsquo; er earth fissure under ther buildin&rsquo;,  what was lettin&rsquo; ther fumes iv er suppressed volcaner leak out He said it was  er most curious &rsquo;n&rsquo; interestin&rsquo; subject, but gor blime, he didn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ave t&rsquo; live  in it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erbout here &rsquo;n&rsquo; now, Apps &rsquo;n&rsquo;  Winterbee, ther plumbers, had their perfeshional curiosity excited, &rsquo;n&rsquo; they  come erlong with er offer iv ther loan iv their boy Sniff et er quid er time.  It seems this &rsquo;ere boy Sniff &rsquo;ad er gift. He was a hexpert smeller out iv  things, &rsquo;n&rsquo; was ther firm&rsquo;s greatest treasure. Spats was asked t&rsquo; take  pertickler care iv him. When Apps &rsquo;n&rsquo; Winterbee was called in ter ferrit out er  gas leak what &rsquo;ad defied all ther other firms in town, it put Sniff on ther  job, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Sniff was never known t&rsquo; fail. He was sent inter all sorts iv dark &rsquo;n&rsquo;  dusty places, over ceilin&rsquo;s, &rsquo;tween walls, under floors, up channels,  anywheres, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he went gaily enough, like er bally foxie after er rat, &rsquo;cause  it was his speciality, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he was proud iv his great erbility. Sniff was what  yeh&rsquo;d call or hinfant progidy, sniffin&rsquo; out mysteries was his big hit. &rsquo;E was a  genius at it, but he didn&rsquo;t look it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;T&rsquo; see Sniff, you wouldn&rsquo; think  he was er champion in his class. He was erbout fourteen, &rsquo;n&rsquo; very small for his  age. They kep&rsquo; him small with gin &rsquo;a&rsquo; &rsquo;ard trainin&rsquo;, I think, so&rsquo;s he could  creep inter any kind iv er rat &rsquo;ole in pursuit iv his callin&rsquo;. He had er dull  eye, &rsquo;n&rsquo; er vacant face, &rsquo;n&rsquo; no chin, his face jist slippin&rsquo; off where his chin  should iv come in, but &rsquo;e had er bonzer nose. He&rsquo;d fair run t&rsquo; nose. You never  see such er nose on er &rsquo;uman face. &rsquo;Twas habnormally over-developed, so t&rsquo;  speak. Lookin&rsquo; et that nose, you was sure Sniff wouldn&rsquo;t live long. &rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t in  ther nature iv things he could go on sustainin&rsquo; sich a snich.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sniff was turned loose on ther  fact&rsquo;ry flat, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;e went over it like er tradesman. Other folks was turned end  on be one gust iv it, but I think Sniff was &rsquo;appy. He was in his helement. He  sorter prowled erbout all ther mormn&rsquo;, gettin&rsquo; ther lay &rsquo;n&rsquo; drift iv ther  varyis currents &rsquo;n&rsquo; odours, &rsquo;n&rsquo; makin&rsquo; his plans; but after lunch he got goin&rsquo;,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; how did he &rsquo;unt! Nothin&rsquo; could &rsquo;old &rsquo;im. He was full iv er sort iv artistic  frenzy, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;e chased trails with his long nose feelin&rsquo; ther way before him fer  all ther world like er &rsquo;ound after er &rsquo;erring. In two hours he&rsquo;d run down four  gas leaks, three old rats, &rsquo;n&rsquo; two escapes frim ther pickle mill nex&rsquo; door.  Then &rsquo;e got out after ther King odour, but that puzzled him. He&rsquo;d come up agin  ther brick wall with er bunt every time, then he&rsquo;d listen t&rsquo; ther tick-tackin&rsquo;  fer er bit, &rsquo;n&rsquo; get back on his tracks, &rsquo;n&rsquo; chase her agin. No use, she alwiz  brought him up short agin ther bricks in ther &rsquo;aunted corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After ther fifth run he stayed  there, studyin&rsquo;. He went down ther wall, &rsquo;n&rsquo; up ther wall, &rsquo;n&rsquo; then er glad  light broke over him</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bring er ladder!&rsquo; he sez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther ladder was brought, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  Sniff went up it, hot on ther trail. Ther top iv that wall was jist er wide,  flat shelf iv brick, on which ther big tye-beams rested. Ther roof over-shot  it. On this shelf, back agin one iv ther rafters, was er parcel what couldn&rsquo;t  be seen frim below. &rsquo;Twas erbout ther size iv er candle box &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther wrapper  was ther tin lining out iv er case, &rsquo;n&rsquo; this tin was polished like silver with  ther paws iv ther ten thousan&rsquo; famished rats what had been spendin&rsquo; ther  brightest years iv their lives, tryin&rsquo; t&rsquo; get in. Would yeh believe it, that  tin was tickin&rsquo; like forty watches, &rsquo;n&rsquo; when Sniff stirred it, you&rsquo;d think it  was full iv live dried peas, &rsquo;n&rsquo; was rattlin&rsquo; on its ace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sniff pulled ther tin parcel  out, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he let her drop, &rsquo;n&rsquo; she bust open on ther floor. Boys, I&rsquo;m done! Here&rsquo;s  where I fail. Mother iv Murphy! how did that parcel fogue! Ther volume iv smell  smashed ther winders, it rattled ther town, clocks stopped, &rsquo;n&rsquo; trams bolted,  fire brigades was called out, &rsquo;n&rsquo; perlice were sent fer in all directions. Ther  hinstruments up et ther hobservatory recorded er earthquake iv great vi&rsquo;lence,  ther Lord Mare resigned his office, &rsquo;n&rsquo; all ther cats left town. Shrieks &rsquo;n&rsquo;  cries was heard in ther streets &rsquo;n&rsquo; people ran &rsquo;n&rsquo; hid in ther cellars,  thinkin&rsquo; ther end iv ther world was come. Benno fell down in er fit, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I had  ter drag him frim under be ther legs. I was a bit ratty meself fer seven days,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; beer ain&rsquo;t never tasted ther same ter me since.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; after all &rsquo;twas on&rsquo;y er  cheese, er good-sized, fat, New Zealan&rsquo; cream cheese, what some one &rsquo;ad pinched  frim ther produce stores in Egg Lane, &rsquo;n&rsquo; wrapped up in tin ter keep ther rats  off, &rsquo;n&rsquo; hid on ther top iv flier wall, till er good charnce come t&rsquo; mooch with  it. I suspect er lad name iv Creegan&mdash;Nipper Creegan&mdash;what got ther sudden jerk  fer punchin&rsquo; ther boss er clinker in ther whiskers. He got fired so prompt he  &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t time t&rsquo; shift his cheese, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it was lef&rsquo; there t&rsquo; ripen &rsquo;n&rsquo; rot, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  set up er storm centre iv cyclonic odorif&rsquo;rousness what knocked ther street out  iv plumb, &rsquo;n&rsquo; redooced unimproved land values t&rsquo; nex&rsquo; t&rsquo; nixie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ther tickin&rsquo;? That was ther  cheese mites what bred &rsquo;n&rsquo; mustered in that cheese, on&rsquo;y these wasn&rsquo;t mites,  they was monsters, &rsquo;n&rsquo; it was ther tin wrapper what we&rsquo;d bin hearin&rsquo; fer weeks.  When ther package broke loose on ther floor, ther ball iv mites bust, &rsquo;n&rsquo; went  skippin&rsquo; erbout ther flat like er flight iv ole man kangeroos. They was  fearsome things t&rsquo; meet in ther dark, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; yeh, pale, dreadful grubs ez  big ez concertinas, with long grey hair, &rsquo;n&rsquo; no features exceptin&rsquo; two dead  black eyes. They could jump five yards, &rsquo;n&rsquo; had er &rsquo;ide on &rsquo;em like er blonde  pig. They was turnin&rsquo; up, fright&rsquo;nin&rsquo; ther paint off ther girls fer weeks  after, &rsquo;n&rsquo; we &rsquo;ad t&rsquo; set rabbit traps &rsquo;n&rsquo; lay poisoned bate for &rsquo;em all over  ther place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther remains iv ther cheese was  removed be divers in full dress, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Sniff got ther Ryle Humane Society&rsquo;s medal  fer &rsquo;erosim, &rsquo;n&rsquo; was rewarded with er public subscription. There&rsquo;s still er  flavor iv that cheese lingerin&rsquo; in ther fact&rsquo;ry t&rsquo; prove what I&rsquo;ve bin tellin&rsquo;  yeh&rsquo;s gorspel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers lifted up his empty  pewter, looked into it, knocked it on the counter in an inverted position, as  if to shake out the dust of dry days, and then said reproachfully to the  Aberdeen engineer off the donkey engine on the wharf, whose turn it was to  &ldquo;spring&rdquo;: &ldquo;Blime, cobber, er yer givin&rsquo; ther barmaid er per petual &rsquo;oliday &rsquo;r  what?&rdquo;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="ALittleLoveAffair"></a>A Little Love Affair</h2>
<p>Feathers, the packer,  owed his name to a strange set of side-whiskers he once grew. Over these the  feathery paper-dust collected till they looked like the wings of an adolescent  gosling. He soon wearied of the nick-name, and shaved off his fluff, thinking  the insult would pass with it. He was mistaken. The sobriquet of the foreman,  Fuzzy Ellis, had a similar origin. His dead-looking, reddish hair was as fine  as tow; it was always distracted, and in it the fibrous dust gathered so  thickly that every jerk of his head produced a miniature dust storm.</p>
<p>Fuzzy was a queer bird. Besides  being long and lank, he had a prematurely withered appearance. The white apron  that enveloped him gave him something of the aspect of a wilted candle. His eye  had a hunted look that corresponded with the distraction of his hair; his  pinched face might have been put on his bones with a palette-knife and had the  sallow livery of Spats&rsquo; factory. It was always moist, as with trepidation, and  from it oozed driblets of whiskers. He was the dustiest man in the world, and  gaunt with everlasting worry. Fuzzy could not be imagined apart from the factory.  He was first to come in the morning, last to leave at night. Nobody in the firm  recollected his beginning. It was vaguely surmised that he was born in the  factory and nourished on its insidious dust and the paste and gum that over-ran  the place and caked on everything. He was regarded as a fixture; that he had  friends or relations was never dreamed of&mdash;he was hardly credited with a soul.</p>
<p>So rooted was this conception of  Fuzzy as an inseparable adjunct of the factory, that Feathers, having proof to  the contrary, went to Benno, the clerk, one Monday morning, feeling like a man  about to endanger a hard-earned reputation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who jer think I seen at the Zoo  yes&rsquo;dee afternoon&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it up,&rdquo; answered Benno,  ruling a line with insolent elaboration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fuzzy!&rdquo; said the packer.</p>
<p>Benno revolved on his high stool  and faced his friend. &ldquo;Knock it off, George Henry,&rdquo; he said, appealingly.  &ldquo;You&rsquo;d be all right iv it wasn&rsquo;t for the drink. Knock it off, ther&rsquo;s a good  feller. You warn&rsquo;t at no Zoo, yeh know.&rdquo; Then, with a change of tone, he  continued: &ldquo;D&rsquo; yeh mean t&rsquo; say yeh saw Fuzzy out on his own&mdash;prowlin&rsquo; round in  th&rsquo; open like a &rsquo;uman bein&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers assured him of it on his  honor as a man and his faith as a Christian. &ldquo;S&rsquo;elp me cat! I did,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Benno surveyed the foreman with a  new interest. &ldquo;After all, I s&rsquo;pose the beggar must be somewhere when we&rsquo;re shut  down,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Feathers carried the story to the  girls, but it seemed probable to them that he was lying, particularly as Sarah  Eddie had been to the Zoo on Sunday and had seen nothing of the foreman there.  And yet the tale was true. Moreover, Fuzzy, having heard Miss Eddie declare her  intention of visiting the Zoological Gardens, had gone there with the  deliberate idea of exhibiting himself to that young lady in his Sunday clothes,  but had been too timid to carry out his purpose. In the marvellous workings of Providence it was  allotted to Sarah Eddie&rsquo;s destiny to awaken a tender passion in the dusty heart  of Fuzzy Ellis.</p>
<p>Sarah was a large, fair young  woman of thirty, stoutly framed, with a mouth extended beyond all reason and  human necessity, good teeth, and a gummy smile. She had been in the factory  some months, and Fuzzy&rsquo;s love was the mysterious and unhallowed growth of a  moment. Sarah, with the mercenary object of securing the most profitable work,  had beguiled him with her Ethiopian grin and glances of matured coyness, and  when the foreman&rsquo;s hand pressed hers, as he placed the work on her board, she  giggled affectedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Ellis, you are a one!&rdquo;  she said.</p>
<p>In the words of Benno the wise,  &ldquo;It took like a vaccination.&rdquo; Fuzzy came up the room with a stunned look in his  eyes, and the expression of a man who had committed himself irretrievably. He  offered no more advances for some days, and then, after hovering about Miss  Eddie&rsquo;s board a dozen times during the morning, he made a rally, and, placing a  small packet on the table beside her paste, fled to cover behind his  cutting-machines, tripping over the truck and barking his shins by the way.</p>
<p>The packet contained three  penn&rsquo;orth of cheap jujubes.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the hands  saw Fuzzy&rsquo;s small sheep-like head shoot up above his machines on a stalk of  neck, transfixed. Fuzzy&rsquo;s eyes were turned upon Sarah with a tender and  absorbed expression. Heaven knows what blissful emotions were stirring softly  in his bony breast, but he was &ldquo;dead to the world.&rdquo; Girls at the top benches  discovered him, and &ldquo;passed the office&rdquo; along. The intelligence drifted down  the flat; work was suspended; silence fell upon the factory. The girls stared  at Fuzzy, and Fuzzy gloated upon the object of his affection with a fatuous  ardor. He suggested an amorous adjutant-bird. A titter ran through the factory.  It swelled to a yell of laughter; and Ellis, recalled to a sense of his position,  ducked, spun the guillotine wildly, and, in his great agitation, nearly cut off  the tip of his index finger.</p>
<p>The idea of Fuzzy as a lover was  the acme of the incongruous; he was so arid, so nervous, so thin, and so  unhuman. No one had any idea of his age, but he looked like a man who had dried  up at the age of thirty-six, and had since been free of all human infirmities.  His little love-affair was to the factory a mad joke; news of it spread to the  printers, it was discussed in the warehouse, it was talked of in the street;  but the foreman, unconscious of all this, continued to steal to Miss Eddie&rsquo;s  board with love-tokens&mdash;a pound of grapes, a bag of buns, a bottle of  ginger-ale; once it was a pork-pie. Miss Eddie was involved in the comedy, and  there were jokes at her expense, but she took them all in very good part, and  continued to ogle Fuzzy with a cow-like playfulness.</p>
<p>Feathers, the humorist, affected  the airs of a desolate man, and encouraged Fuzzy with descriptions of his own  hopeless love of Sarah and pitiable accounts of her recent cruelties. He hinted  at suicide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s come between us,&rdquo;  sighed the packer, wiping away a tear. Benno swore that the foreman almost  smiled at this. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas touch &rsquo;n&rsquo; go,&rdquo; said Benno. The clerk was of opinion that  Sarah Eddie had a &ldquo;bit iv splosh.&rdquo; He declared he had seen her smuggle a  bank-book out of her bag. That afternoon Fuzzy gave Sarah a brooch. It was of  an ancient device, and had lost a stone, but was large and had some value as  old gold.</p>
<p>It was several days before the  girls quite understood Sarah, but when they did there was a sudden revulsion of  feeling. Fuzzy&rsquo;s courtship was no longer a joke&mdash;it was an outrage. All the easy  work was going to Sarah&rsquo;s board. She was given the pleasant and profitable  jobs. The special stuff that had hitherto been distributed fairly among the  piece-workers all brought extra money to Sarah, and her earnings went up with a  jump. This was not to be borne. Spats&rsquo; Beauties began to murmur, murmurs  swelled to open complaint, cries of bitterness and insult followed, and then  the Beauties began to throw things. Blobs of half-caked paste assailed the  foreman and clung in his hair; balls of sodden paper fell about him; a  recently-emptied flour-sack turned inside-out was dropped on him down the  lift-well; an unknown hand knocked him headlong off the stairs with a bundle of  waste. Fuzzy&rsquo;s hunted look deepened to one of terror. He moved gingerly, but  his infatuation made him strong to endure, and Sarah continued to score.</p>
<p>An act of flagrant favoritism  precipitated a strike. The piece-workers threw their brushes into the paste,  and, seating themselves on their boards, swung their heels, and yelled defiance  at Fuzzy. A dozen of them went downstairs as a deputation to Spats, and the  foreman, after stumbling about the room in a fit of nervous irresponsibility,  retreated behind the guillotines to await developments.</p>
<p>The deputation charged into the  office of the boss. Twelve voices raised in vociferous complaint. Spats drove  them up stairs again with angry snarls and snappings, and sent for Fuzzy. Ellis  returned from that interview looking a complete wreck, and Miss Kruse informed  the girls that for the future there would be a fair division of the  better-class work.</p>
<p>The foreman could still do his  adored many favors, and he was her humble servant. Her paste was brought for  her, he carried her work to her hand, and although she did not scrape her board  on Saturday like the others, it was white and clean when she came to work on  Monday; so that it was still worth Sarah&rsquo;s while to shed shy glances on Samuel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do so grow on a body,&rdquo; she  whispered one morning, and this excited Fuzzy to such a degree that he was  bumping into things three hours later.</p>
<p>But the termination of Fuzzy&rsquo;s  love-affair was sudden and dramatic. Early one Saturday morning, a bulky,  black-browed man came lumbering up the back stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;S your name Ellis&rdquo; he said to  Feathers. The packer directed him along the room with a nod of the head, and  the bulky stranger moved in that direction. To the surprise of everyone, Sarah  Eddie flew out, and intercepted him, brandishing a threatening brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If yeh do, Jim!&rdquo; she cried in  great agitation. &ldquo;Mind, if yeh do!&rdquo; Jim seemed prepared to chance it, and,  thrusting her aside, passed on. &ldquo;Your name Ellis, Mister&rdquo; he asked Benno. The  clerk pointed out the foreman with his pen, and the intruder faced Fuzzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They tell me you&rsquo;re Ellis!&rdquo; he  said. The tone was threatening, the man&rsquo;s air distinctly dangerous. It was  obviously unwise to be Ellis. Fuzzy hedged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, er&mdash;it depends,&rdquo; he said,  and retreated timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If so happens you are Ellis, I  mean to punch your damn&rsquo; head off.&rdquo; It was the tone of an earnest man, one who  had resolved on a course of conduct, and had no use for argument.</p>
<p>Fuzzy fled behind the folding  board, and the bulky man dashed after him. The pursuer was not a man to stick  at trifles; he carried the long board off its trestles in his rush, but fell  among the ruins, and Fuzzy went down too. The foreman extricated himself first,  and darted for another table, Jim after him. They raced round twice, and then  faced each other across the board.</p>
<p>Jim controlled himself for a  moment and shook a terrible fist at his destined victim, and then thumped the  board determinedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&rsquo;&mdash;wha&rsquo;&mdash;what is it&rdquo; gasped Ellis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell yer what it is,&rdquo; he  said. &ldquo;That there&rsquo;s my girl.&rdquo; He pointed to Sarah Eddie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been goin&rsquo; to  marry me, more &rsquo;r less, fer a year, an&rsquo; now you&rsquo;ve chipped-in. Well, I don&rsquo;t  allow it! D&rsquo;yer hear? I don&rsquo;t allow it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police!&rdquo; piped Fuzzy.</p>
<p>Smash went another board before  the impetuous Jim, and Fuzzy fled again, under the tables, around the  packing-benches, and then down the long flat, with Jim at his heels. It was a  sensational scramble, and choke-full of interest to the Beauties. They clambered  on to their boards, and screamed encouragement to Jim. The stranger made a grab  at Ellis, and it seemed that all was over with the foreman, but a parcel of  bags tripped his rival, and he fell headlong. This was Samuel&rsquo;s chance; he  raced for the ladder at the opening in the ceiling, straddled up it like a  distracted spider, and crawled into the darkness above. He was making a  desperate effort to haul the ladder up after him when Jim snatched at the  bottom-rung, and, swinging his great weight brought the ladder down with a  crash on top of himself, and plucked Fuzzy on to his face at the opening,  clutching wildly at the edges to avert a disaster. Jim reared the ladder again,  and, racing up it, scrambled into the loft, and those below heard muffled sounds  of running feet, bumpings, and curses, coming from above the ceiling.</p>
<p>The loft was a spacious place,  hot and black as the pit, and the strange, volatile dust characteristic of  Spats&rsquo; factory lay a foot deep on its floor, and clung thickly to the weird  festoons of cobweb that spanned the rafters. A rat-fight up there was  sufficient to convert the atmosphere into a feathery mass. There was silence in  the factory&mdash;all ears were strained to mark the progress of the race overheard.  Every bump sent a blast of dust out of the manholes, and it billowed along the  factory ceiling, and poured out of the windows like smoke. A shrill cry  indicated that Fuzzy had fallen into the clutches of the enemy. A confusion of  yells, much swearing, and a great trampling and bumping, during which the dust  rolled from the openings in dense masses, told of a bitter, hand-to-hand  contest. Then a body was dragged along the ceiling, and presently Jim&rsquo;s boots  came into view on the ladder; his legs followed, but slowly, and after his legs  came his body, and then came Fuzzy. Jim, backing down the ladder, reckless of  consequences, dragged Ellis out with a run on top of himself, and the two fell  in a tangle on a heap of stock.</p>
<p>The identity of the men had to be  taken for granted; they were now monstrous objects, with few human attributes,  swathed round with clinging rags of black cobweb, their features blotted out,  masses of web hanging from their limbs like elfin wings. But Jim had not lost  sight of his mission. He seized on the foreman again, and dragged him through  the factory, seeking Sarah Eddie; and when he found her he dumped Fuzzy at her  feet. He tried to spit, but his mouth was like a dust-bin; he opened it, but  was inarticulate. Then he sneezed five times, and speech returned to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;ll settle this matter,&rdquo;  he said. He shook Fuzzy up, and they were obscured in the dust. &ldquo;Here, you,&rdquo; he  went on, &ldquo;is this here your girl, &rsquo;r is she mine&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fuzzy made a gesture of complete  abandonment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give her up&rdquo; Fuzzy nodded  supinely. Jim was still holding him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gives it to her straight  that all&rsquo;s over atween yer, that you ain&rsquo;t havin&rsquo; any truck with her  whatsomever, savin&rsquo; in the way o&rsquo; business&rdquo; The wretched foreman signified his  assent. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Jim, &ldquo;that bein&rsquo; so, I ain&rsquo;t got nothin&rsquo; more agin  yer.&rdquo; And he dropped Ellis on the floor.</p>
<p>The trouble being ended, two  policemen, who had been hastily summoned under the impression that murder was  being done on the top flat, came up the stairs and seized upon Jim. He was  fined five pounds, with the alternative of three weeks&rsquo; gaol, and took the  alternative with a good grace. To show he had no ill-feeling towards anybody,  he put ninepence in the poor-box.</p>
<p>Three weeks and two days later,  Sarah was married to a wharf-lumper, who, there is every reason to believe, was  identical with Jim, and Fuzzy&rsquo;s dream of love was over.</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheMorbidBoy"></a>The Morbid Boy</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;truculent boy had been  summarily dismissed, and the morbid boy was introduced late on the following  Monday morning. Billy, the devil, hit him with the cake&nbsp;off a tin of ink  as he lumbered wearily up the stairs. The morbid boy was very broad and  extremely meaty. His head was large and almost square; nose, ears, cheeks, and  lips were puffy, and he had a fat forehead. His color was pasty, and his  average expression vacuous. This morning its vacuity was relieved by a dull  wonder as he stood at the head of the stair, his arms hanging limply, gazing at  the pack of girls. It dawned on him presently that he had been deceived, that  life would not be worth living in this ruck of heathens, and he started  downstairs again.</p>
<p>The packer recaptured him on the  printers&rsquo; flat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Mumps,&rdquo; said  Feathers. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the new boy, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;M orf it,&rdquo; answered the boy,  sullenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats!&rdquo; said the packer. &ldquo;This is  dead easy. Yer got nothin&rsquo; t&rsquo; do &rsquo;ere but tickle the pianer &rsquo;n&rsquo; blow the dust  off the chandeliers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers towed the lad back to  the flat, and away to the changing room, where he superintended the removal of  his coat and the donning of a hessian apron with a large pocket across the  middle, a relic of the truculent boy. Then he led Mumps to the busy half of the  long room, and started him up the track to the foreman&rsquo;s retreat. But a couple  of minutes after resuming work the packer saw that Mumps was standing where he  had left him, in the middle of the gangway, gazing straight before him, like  something petrified. Mumps had no initiative; this was discovered before he had  been in the factory an hour. A girl&rsquo;s glance had the effect of striking him  motionless in the middle of a job, and he would stand inert, with a lolling  tongue and a dead eye. Fuzzy, the foreman, gave him a fresh start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice, bright, active, lovable  lad that,&rdquo; said the clerk to Feathers. &ldquo;Wonder where they gathered him&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He come over th&rsquo; &rsquo;sylum wall,&rdquo;  said the packer. &ldquo;Already he&rsquo;s brought the best knife in the big machine down  on a spanner, cut two reams iv cartridge t&rsquo; waste, &rsquo;n&rsquo; spilt a quart iv ink  inter Fuzzy&rsquo;s lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; he hums like a little bone  mill,&rdquo; said Benno, &ldquo;bless him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was his capacity as a &ldquo;hummer&rdquo;  that conquered the factory. Where he passed went consternation, and even Fuzzy,  who was supposed to be superior to little prejudices, put Mumps from him, and  regarded him with a thoughtful and troubled air. The Beauties were not hampered  by the niceties of polite convention; they rarely strained the point at which  forbearance ceases to be a virtue; and when Mumps passed them by the injured  did not stifle their cries, but yelled like devils.</p>
<p>Martha, the ex-professional fat  girl, when Mumps brought work to her table, cried &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo; threw her apron over  her head, and sat down on the floor in an imitation fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it Christian burial,&rdquo;  squealed the thin machinist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scrap fat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shift that tannery!&rdquo; The whole  flat was giving tongue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yah, dry it, can&rsquo;t yeh,&rdquo; said  Benno, &ldquo;The lad was reared in a soap foundry &rsquo;n&rsquo; can&rsquo;t help hisself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumps did not show that he was  conscious of the impression he was making; the scorn of the girls failed to  deepen the heavy imbecility of his manner. It was late in the afternoon, when  all hope of an abatement of the nuisance had been abandoned, that Feathers  attacked the new boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name o&rsquo; Jimmy Jee, wha&rsquo;s  the matter with yeh&rdquo; he cried, brutally. &ldquo;Bli me, you&rsquo;re &rsquo;ummin&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;  awful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Taint me, neither,&rdquo; growled  Mumps.</p>
<p>Feathers pulled at the pocket of  the apron. &ldquo;What yeh got &rsquo;ere&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pooh! Strike me dead! She&rsquo;s a corker.  Take it out!&rdquo; he yelled.</p>
<p>Mumps dipped into the pocket and  produced a dead rat on a string, the identical rat with which the truculent boy  had stampeded the factory. Being unable to escape from the folded apron, the  beast had perished miserably, and Mumps had carried its remains with him all  day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re a shine idyit,&rdquo;  commented Feathers. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t yer throw the thing away&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How wiz I t&rsquo;know&rdquo; whined the  morbid boy.</p>
<p>This was characteristic of Mumps;  the rat might have remained there a month before he would have taken upon  himself the responsibility of dislodging it.</p>
<p>Feathers had some felicity in the  selection of nicknames, and although the new boy was officially entered as John  Robey, the room refused to recognize him as anything but Mumps. Strange to say,  Ellis contracted a liking for John; possibly because the youngster was never  impudent. John, who seemed to be in a perpetual state of moral hibernation,  hadn&rsquo;t sufficient impulse to be insolent, and the foreman had had a large and  varied experience of boys with impulse. As a rule, the boys treated Fuzzy  brutally. The truculent boy&mdash;4ft. 9in. and 13 next birthday&mdash;had once clamored  violently for three rounds with his boss, being anxious to prove in the eyes of  the whole world which was &ldquo;best man.&rdquo; True, Mumps was dull and needed close  watching, and had to be started and stopped like a machine, and could never  learn what was to be done next, and was liable to fall into a condition of  open-mouthed inanimation in the middle of a job, but he never gave back-talk,  and there was something respectful in his stupid awe.</p>
<p>Three mornings running a very  ponderous woman, who was taken to be his mother, lugged Mumps up the stairs and  drove him to his work, but after that John accepted the inevitable and came  regularly at eight. He brought enormous lunches in a rush basket, and sat alone  amongst the bales to eat them. When work started again, his distress was  painful to behold, and he was often heard to groan pitiably during the hour  that followed. Then Benno would tell him that he ought to have his lunch made  to measure and not go trying to fit a No. 3 stomach on a No. 9 meal; and  Feathers would gravely advise him to have it pulled.</p>
<p>One morning Mumps fell into a  state of dreamy inaction over a truck of grey sugar paper, just where the front  stairs cut into the flat. A yap at his back jerked him into consciousness, and,  looking round, he discovered the imposing figure of the boss at his heels.  Instantly John Robey was thrown into a condition of fatuous irresponsibility;  he seized on his truck, heaved up the great burden, made a blind stagger, and  rushed the whole box of tricks straight down the stairs. The truck bounded,  threw a dazzling revolution, and its handles crashed through the floor of the  first landing. Great reams of paper leaped down the remaining stairs, shooting  in all directions into the printing room, and the crashes told of ravage and disaster.  Mumps stared after his lost load for seven terrible seconds, and then turned,  and fled for the men&rsquo;s dressing-room. He reappeared with his hat in his hand,  dragging his coat after him, and darted down the back stairs.</p>
<p>Feathers overtook John, and he  was given another trial after the foreman had interceded on his behalf, but the  printers&rsquo; devil never forgave him. One of the reams having jumped into a tub of  lye, and deluged Billy with the awful mixture, the boy felt called upon to  subject John to monotonous persecution as long as he remained in the place.  Mumps was a child of persecution, but he dulled the point of practical jokes by  preserving a Chinese unconsciousness. The packer dropped all subterfuge, and  treated him as an open and unabashed idiot, telling him twenty times a day  exactly how much of an ass he was, in language calculated to appeal to the  lowest intelligence, but always with a well-intentioned and benevolent air as  of one imparting useful knowledge. Benno, however, adopted a tone of biting  irony, and it must be credited to Mumps&rsquo; penetration that one day, after  surveying the clerk heavily for five minutes or so, he said: &ldquo;I hate you,  Dickson!&rdquo; Although the tone was phlegmatic, this, coming from Mumps, was  regarded as an amazing burst of confidence.</p>
<p>At about this time there began a  frequent disappearance of lunches, and although John Robey was known as a  monument of gluttony it did not occur to anybody that he had degenerated into a  crib thief. For over a week suspicion rested upon the rats, which were frequent  in the factory, though during all that time Mumps&rsquo; painful indispositions might  have enlightened the dullest minds. One day when three lunches were missed,  Mumps remained curled up on a big bag of waste for some time after the lunch  hour, sweating and groaning. He told Feathers that it was &ldquo;apendickitis&rdquo; he  had. Later the crib thief grew discriminating, and stole only the choicest  morsels from the lunches, spoiling no less than nine in one morning. But it was  not till Miss Kruse sent John out for sixpenn&rsquo;orth of mixed pastry, and he came  back with the empty bag and explained dully that he had eaten the stuff &ldquo;by  accident,&rdquo; that the elucidation of the mystery was whispered about.</p>
<p>Next morning at about a quarter  to twelve, while Mumps was depositing work on Martha Pilcher&rsquo;s board, the fat  girl called across the room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, youse, I&rsquo;ve fixed up them  rats proper this trip. They nicked some &rsquo;am sandwiches from my lunch this  mornin&rsquo;. Them sandwiches was poisoned!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumps dropped the goods he had in  his hands, and stared at Martha, and his pallor took a faint greenish tinge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I poisoned &rsquo;em myself,&rdquo; said  Martha, &ldquo;with ninepenn&rsquo;orth o&rsquo; arsenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mumps doubled his arms across his  stomach, bent like a man in agony, and uttered a long, anguished howl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;s enough poison in &rsquo;em to  kill a norse,&rdquo; continued the fat girl, remorselessly.</p>
<p>The boy scrambled under the  bench, and rushed for the stairs. He was heard to fall down the last flight. He  raced through the warehouse, colliding blindly with the boss in the doorway,  and a few minutes later the people in the main street of the city saw a  white-faced, despairing Mumps, wild-eyed, bare-headed, and wearing a bag apron,  racing along the road like something frantic. Mumps clamored at the door of the  most expensive doctor in town, kicking the panels, pulling the bell, and  shrieking simultaneously; and when the door was opened to him he fell in,  crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m poisoned. Quick! quick! do  something&mdash;they&rsquo;ve poisoned me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>About an hour later, a tall,  grave constable brought John Robey back to us, and John was a woeful thing to  see&mdash;pale and clammy, and so limp that the policeman had to hold him up, like  exhibit A, while he explained to the company:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He swore he was poisoned. The  doctor said &rsquo;twas nothing of the kind, but the b&rsquo;y was so set on it, the  gentleman gave him a bit iv an emetic to satisfy him. Bechune me &rsquo;n&rsquo; youse,  things iv happened sinst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks it,&rdquo; said the packer.</p>
<p>Mumps was dropped on a bag of  waste, where he groaned so fearfully that Fuzzy endeavoured to reassure him by  explaining that whatever had happened to Martha&rsquo;s sandwiches they were free of  poison, and fit for human consumption.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that, mister,&rdquo; said  Mumps, weakly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m starvin&rsquo;. They ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; left inside o&rsquo; me, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;m  starvin&rsquo; to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no denying that the  possibility had real terrors for him, so Ellis took pity on his emptiness, and  Mumps was sent home to re-stock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><a name="TheToucher"></a>The Toucher</h2>
<p>He was&nbsp;a jobbing  hand from the printers&rsquo; flat. His name was Raymond Cato, but he acquired  &ldquo;Toucher&rdquo; as a complimentary title when we knew him better. He was tall,  sallow, languid and distressingly impecunious. I put it that way because Mr  Cato&rsquo;s impecuniosity was more a trait of character than the result of  misfortune. He was the sort of young man who would have been impecunious had he  been born to ten thousand a year. He was slovenly in his dress, and his  trousers were always worn to strings at the heels, and this fringe collected  various foreign bodies, which dragged after him as be walked, Raymond being too  languid or too indifferent to shake them off. You got to know when Toucher was  coming by the clatter of vagrant articles attached to his trousers fringe. He  once towed a disused fish-tin after him through a whole hot afternoon. That will  give you an idea of the sort of person Raymond Cato was. But this depraved  young man, while apparently sleeping against a case, could paw type with  miraculous speed and precision, and he handled the most intricate jobs with  absolute certainty when under the influence of two buckets of very bad beer.</p>
<p>Mr Cato had only been ten days in  the factory when be came to the packer&rsquo;s board and leaned there. There were two  peach-nuts, a metal rule, and the rind off a tin of red ink dangling at his  fetlock. He passed his hand wearily over his brow, brushing back his long,  black hair, and rested his eyes on the packer. Raymond&rsquo;s eyes were large and  dark, and suffused with an overwhelming sadness. The Toucher owed his success  largely to those appealing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rsquo;pose we do a break, Mills.&rdquo; he  said, joylessly.</p>
<p>Feathers looked at him with  bitter reproach. The remark was an invitation to execute a strategic exit by  the lift door, and drink pints, and Feathers was up to his ears in work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ow th&rsquo;ell can I&rdquo; he said,  pointing at the long list of orders, &ldquo;&rsquo;nt&rsquo; the whole flamin&rsquo; warehouse whoopin&rsquo;  fer goods?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well,&rdquo; said Cam, resignedly. &ldquo;I had a tizzie, my last and it&rsquo;s so  lonely I reckoned I&rsquo;d let it go.&rdquo; He took the coin out, turned it over in his  fingers, and sighed. &ldquo;Left blooming alone,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down to it, are yeh?&rdquo; asked the  packer with sympathy. &ldquo;There&rsquo;ve been times when I&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad t&rsquo; run by ther pub  with me eyes shut meself, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fair on my knuckle-bone,&rdquo; said  the printer. &ldquo;But a man doesn&rsquo;t care on his own account. It&rsquo;s the old lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers looked sidelong.  Feathers&rsquo;s class is always suspicious of sentiment; but there was no snivelling  in Raymond&rsquo;s tone. His expression was that of a strong man who bears his  troubles bravely, and his accent hinted at a profound emotion kept well in  hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tribulation in thor &rsquo;appy &rsquo;ome?&rdquo;  queried Feathers, warily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slathers, Mills, old man.&rdquo;  Raymond Cato turned his shoulder, but the strong composed voice continued  presently: &ldquo;The mother, you know. Seen better days, George; good family.  Dreadfully ill, and&rdquo;&mdash;here the voice was almost cold&mdash;&ldquo;and I haven&rsquo;t the  half-crown to pay for her medicine tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jimmy Jee!&rdquo; murmured Feathers.  He fingered a solitary coin in his pocket lovingly, drew it out, and laid it on  the bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s arf er dollar you can  have ther use of,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>There was just the faintest  suggestion of a start, the most momentary hint of eagerness, in Raymond&rsquo;s  descent upon the money. The thing had been easier than he expected. Mills  noticed the start, and a pang of repentance shot through him. Cato realized his  mistake instantly. He placed a firm retainer on the half-crown, and slid it  back towards the packer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, old man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you  can&rsquo;t spare this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Garn!&rdquo; retorted the packer, with  simulated indifference, &ldquo;get a &rsquo;ammerlock on it.&rdquo; With a flash of diplomacy, he  added; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s on&rsquo;y till Saterdee, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, all right, Geordie&mdash;till  Saturday. You&rsquo;re a good sort.&rdquo; Cato&rsquo;s tone implied that the time might soon  come when he would show his gratitude by dying for the packer. He took up the  half-crown slowly, reluctantly, and went gently downstairs.</p>
<p>For a minute Feathers gazed  fixedly at the blank wall before him, forgetting his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been stabbed,&rdquo; he  whispered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it, er clean stab. &rsquo;N&rsquo; I was beginnin&rsquo; t&rsquo; think I was grown  up. Geordie Mills, you ain&rsquo;t fit t&rsquo; be allowed out without yer aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers was not a man to show  his wounds. He said nothing, and in the course of a day or so the town  traveller came to him with his trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of young Cato, the comp  with the fatal beauty of a consumptive nun,&rdquo; said Goudy; &ldquo;is he a confidence  trick or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s ther pride iv ther fam&rsquo;ly,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; ther sole support iv all his bed-ridden relations,&rdquo; replied the packer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;s touched me three times  in a week, and I&rsquo;m as Scotch as most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;d he plead? Was it corf  drops for his sick sister, &rsquo;r fun&rsquo;ral expenses fer his dead brother-in-law left  over from last week consequence iv thor &rsquo;ard &rsquo;earted undertaker refusin&rsquo;  delivery at ther graveside?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how he did it,&rdquo;  mused Goudy, scratching his whiskers. &ldquo;He must have used laughing gas. &rsquo;Twas  absolutely painless extraction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s er hartist&mdash;got er touch  like velvet. &rsquo;E put&rsquo;s ther acid on so&rsquo;t yeh think it&rsquo;s ther milk iv &rsquo;uman  kindness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; cried Goudy, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s  dipped up something of yours then, has he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers almost blushed. &ldquo;Come  off,&rdquo; he said, with a shade less than his usual confidence. &ldquo;Ther gay deceivers  don&rsquo;t twitter t&rsquo; me. I&rsquo;ve bin too long out iv th&rsquo; egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I was  forgetting,&rdquo; chortled the town traveller, softly. &ldquo;You are Abdul the Wise and  Wonderful. You are the great Take-Down. The bad men go home by the back streets  to escape your machinations, and you&rsquo;ve brought hundreds of spielers to destitution.&rdquo;  And Goudy went about his business, whistling absently the offensive refrain of  &ldquo;Muggins the Juggins&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Feathers pasted a label, and  attached it to a parcel with unwonted precision. He hated Goudy when he used  big words. &ldquo;Any&rsquo;ow,&rdquo; said Mills, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not er soft thing for beginners. I&rsquo;m not  sich er snag fer sharpers that ther boys practise on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This little disputation rendered  it unnecessary for Feathers to breathe a word about the manner in which the  Toucher had stabbed him. The town traveller, too, concluded that his reputation  as a business man would not be enhanced by further discussion, and so Raymond  Cato was free to play upon the tender buds of human sympathy in the lean and  dusty breast of Samuel Ellis, foreman of the flat.</p>
<p>Ellis was cutting a ream of  tinfoil for which Toucher was waiting, and Toucher&rsquo;s sadness was dramatic. He  sighed heavily, and a tear fell on the polished platform of the guillotine.  Raymond gently wiped it off with a piece of waste.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well, then, Mr Cato?&rdquo;  said Ellis. The woeful foreman even ministered Billy, the personal devil from  the printing flat.</p>
<p>Raymond Cato started like a  guilty thing, moved away a few steps, changed his mind, as if convinced that  Fuzzy was the kind of man in whom any stricken soul might confide, returned,  and placed the photograph of a baby boy on the platform. The baby was taken on  the half-shell, and looked like one of those remarkably fine children who earn  an excellent living by posing as examples of the results of feeding on Somebody  s infants&rsquo; Condition Mixture. The young man had found the photograph in a  drawer downstairs that afternoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a father yourself?&rdquo; he  asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&rdquo; said Ellis, &ldquo;but I have a  sister what is. Five she has.&rdquo; And then, with a lugubrious effort to show  interest, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s he, a boy or a girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know him now,&rdquo;  Raymond said, huskily. &ldquo;Skin and bone&mdash;skin and bone. And he cries to me so  pitifully; and what can I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you tried castor oil?&rdquo;  asked Ellis, vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said the young man, in  a low, terrible voice &ldquo;if that boy dies, I don&rsquo;t care what becomes of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; murmured the foreman,  deeply touched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what&rsquo;s a man to do?&mdash;what can  a man do? They order expensive things&mdash;chicken in champagne. I tell you, I feel  sometimes that I could commit murder to procure the money that might be the  saving of my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t if I was you,&rdquo; Ellis  said. He was quite agitated. He looked at Cato with pitiful eyes. &ldquo;I really  wouldn&rsquo;t you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond snatched up the tinfoil  and walked away, stopped, and came back, looked Ellis square in the eye,  steadily, for nearly half a minute, and then he said deliberately,  emphatically, as if putting the foreman to the test of his life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you lend me  half-a-sovereign?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; of course,&rdquo; stammered  Fuzzy. He went to his vest pocket for the money. His hands quite trembled with  eagerness as he handed it to Cato.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mind, now, no murders,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me or I shall  break down,&rdquo; faltered Raymond Cato, in the character of one unaccustomed to  such great kindness and he fled from the flat.</p>
<p>Benno&rsquo;s turn came later. Be also  went to Feathers with the tale. He tried to speak as one with unshaken  confidence in the Toucher, but there were subtle doubts hovering at the back of  his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got ther luck iv er lame cat,  Cato has,&rdquo; he said, fiddling with the packer&rsquo;s scales. &ldquo;D&rsquo;jer hear about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feathers fanned out a ream, and  knocked it up like a second Cinquevalli; then he sought a hiding place for the  incriminating tobacco juice, and spat with judgement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Benno,&rdquo; he said, with  aggravating conviction, &ldquo;yer comin&rsquo; t&rsquo; me with ther story iv yer shame?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give&rsquo;s er charnce,&rdquo; retorted the  clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ther lad below been nibblin&rsquo; yer  ear, &rsquo;n thinkin&rsquo; iv doin&rsquo; er mag erbout sheddin&rsquo; yer beans in ther sacred cause  iv charity, but it don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re one what knows,&rdquo; sneered  Benno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, er bloke&rsquo;s lived er bit,&rdquo;  admitted the oracle. &ldquo;Chat aloud, Benjamin, I&rsquo;m waitin&rsquo; fer ther &rsquo;arrowin&rsquo;  details. Was it his pore ole father, what was er Dook once, crying all night  with dried peas in his appendicitis, him bein&rsquo; er victim to &rsquo;em &rsquo;r his lady  mother who&rsquo;s li&rsquo;ble t&rsquo; become sober at any moment if ther charitably inclined  don&rsquo;t come to &rsquo;er assistance in &rsquo;er hour iv need? &rsquo;Cause I may tell yeh, Benno  ther seraph, that Cato&rsquo;s parents &rsquo;ve both bin missin&rsquo; for years. They saw what  he was comin&rsquo; to when he was five, &rsquo;n&rsquo; did er guy, leavin&rsquo; him t&rsquo; ther mercy iv  er crool world on er pub doorstep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothin&rsquo; like it,&rdquo; said the  clerk. &ldquo;He had a naxident&mdash;swallered er thick-un. I was workin&rsquo; a bit late day  before yes&rsquo;day, &rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;long erbout arf past six who should come sprintin&rsquo;  upstairs but me nibs, pale&rsquo;s er blessed egg, hair on end&mdash;fair dilly. The bums  was in his house fer rent, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he was hurryin&rsquo; &rsquo;ome with ther quid he&rsquo;d got  advanced stuck in his tooth box, when he butted into some gazob in ther street,  &rsquo;n&rsquo; down went ther thick-un. He was tearin&rsquo; ratty t&rsquo; raise another jim. Er  bloke he knows promised him four half dollars, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he come t&rsquo; me fer ther rest,  seein&rsquo; I was a cobber in er way, &rsquo;n&rsquo; his &rsquo;ome sweet &rsquo;ome was goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; pieces on  his &rsquo;ands. Acourse, I parted me arf jim&mdash;couldn&rsquo;t have ther brick face t&rsquo; do  less under ther circs. &rsquo;Twas on&rsquo;y fer er day, he said, cause he was goin&rsquo; under  er operation yes&rsquo;day ter recover then lost goblin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;N&rsquo; was ther operation er  triumph iv surgical skill?&rdquo; asked Feathers. &ldquo;I know&mdash;they recovered ten sovs &rsquo;n&rsquo;  er gold watch, &rsquo;n&rsquo; Cato&rsquo;s payin&rsquo; two &rsquo;undred per cent dividends t&rsquo; ther share  holders. Yer goin&rsquo; t&rsquo; hinvite me out t&rsquo; ther parlour bar, &rsquo;n&rsquo; plaster me in &rsquo;n&rsquo;  out with sixpenny drinks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t bettin&rsquo; on that.&rdquo;  Benno was gloomy now. &ldquo;No; his nibs come t&rsquo; me yes&rsquo;day &rsquo;n&rsquo; said he&rsquo;d seen his  medical adviser, &lsquo;if the blessed operation &rsquo;ud cost one &rsquo;n&rsquo; a &rsquo;arf, &rsquo;n&rsquo; that  he&rsquo;d go on with it if I&rsquo;d contribit another dollar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&rsquo; yeh did it, yeh did it!&rdquo;  yelled Feathers in ecstasy. &ldquo;Yeh sank another five shillin&rsquo; in yer wild cat.  Oh, here&rsquo;s Bertie off ther boat, here&rsquo;s Little Willie. Some kind gentleman hold  his purse while he gets his &rsquo;ead read. Yeh did it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Tain&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; retorted  Benno.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t it? Well, y&rsquo; orter  wear ear muffs this bitin&rsquo; weather, silly boy.&rdquo; Feathers slapped at Benno with  feminine affectation. &ldquo;Why, Cato never had no &rsquo;ome that it &rsquo;ud pay to put er  bailiff in at tuppence er day. He&rsquo;s got er leaky room at mother Spargo&rsquo;s, in Williamson Street,  fer which &rsquo;e owes regular every Fridee, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he dosses on er two-feather bed,  weather permittin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently it was Mr Cato&rsquo;s  intention to try the acid on Feathers again. He approached the packer a few  days after Benno&rsquo;s confession, and he had the air of one patient under great  provocation. The packer&rsquo;s hand went to his ear instinctively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would you take a good thing  for the Handicap tomorrow. Feathers?&rdquo; said the comp. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re the straightest  man here, and the only one I&rsquo;d let into this with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The packer did not reply for a  few moments. He lingered for effect, chewing absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ther one yeh worked on  Billy?&rdquo; He spoke without interest.</p>
<p>Raymond looked at Mills with the  reproachful eyes of a starved dog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t trust me, George,&rdquo; he  said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chattin&rsquo; iv good things,&rdquo;  continued Feathers, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s gone wrong with that beautiful arf-dollar iv mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you lend me half-a-dollar?  Of course&mdash;of course, you did, Oh, that&rsquo;s all right, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s er weight off me mind,&rdquo;  sighed Feathers. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve bin expectin&rsquo; that two &rsquo;n&rsquo; er tanner home. I&rsquo;ve bin  sittin&rsquo; up iv nights waitin&rsquo; fer it comin&rsquo;, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I got t&rsquo; thinkin&rsquo; yeh was  neglectin&rsquo; me. Ray, &rsquo;n&rsquo; devotin&rsquo; all yer money t&rsquo; good works.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The comp&rsquo;s sadness was  intensified by Mills&rsquo; sarcasm. &ldquo;Surely a miserable half dollar wouldn&rsquo;t hurt  you,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It &rsquo;urts me pride,&rdquo; answered  Feathers. &ldquo;It &rsquo;urts me t&rsquo; think I&rsquo;ve bin done on ther grid. The hagony&rsquo;s  somethin&rsquo; awful, &rsquo;n&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve gotter get that &rsquo;arf-bull &rsquo;r sometin&rsquo; dangerous may  set in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, you shall have it  immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get runnin&rsquo; me down with  it, Ray&mdash;gi&rsquo; me time t&rsquo; break ther glad tidin&rsquo;s t&rsquo; me fam&rsquo;ly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Raymond Cato spent the  dinner-hour discussing the drama and kindred arts with Martha Pilcher, and in  the afternoon he sent the half-crown to Mills in an envelope inscribed, &ldquo;With  R.C.&rsquo;s compliments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the Toucher had  almost exhausted the male employees. There were many aching victims downstairs,  and his title was recognized all through the factory. He paid a pressing  creditor when he could borrow the necessary sum from another subject, but that  did not happen often. Strangers were continually asking for him at the door in  the lane, and people would await his coming for an hour after he had gone home  over the adjoining roofs, and down via an accommodating tea warehouse with an  open-air staircase. Raymond borrowed only small sums from the Beauties, but he  was very successful with them. The other young men always approached the girls  in a mood of artful and distressing levity, but the Toucher was very grave with  them, and always sympathetic whatever the complaint might be, and there was  scarcely a Beauty who hadn&rsquo;t a complaint of some kind by her, if only as a  convenient theme of conversation. Half-a-dozen of them would have died for the  bibulous comp despite the bottle-oh&rsquo;s stock garnered in the trouser fringe at  his boot heels, and every paster but one seemed good for a shilling in exchange  for a sigh or two and a pathetic glance from his soulful eyes. Those eyes were  irresistible when Raymond was really thirsty.</p>
<p>The one girl whom Raymond had not  been seen to approach for a little loan was Miss Eva Magill. Miss Eva was not  as young as some, and she had no &ldquo;cobbers&rdquo; amongst the Beauties. She was demure  and steadfast, came softly into the factory with down cast eyes, worked quietly  and persistently in an out-of-the-way corner, with drooping lids, and passed  out again, noiselessly, with eyes unlifted, and was wholly unknown. She was  disliked and respected by the whole factory.</p>
<p>Toucher&rsquo;s finish was sudden and  dramatic. One afternoon faint echoes of a warm debate came up from the  warehouse. Presently Miss Magill was sent for. She went down, with her apron  over her face, weeping. She returned in a quarter of an hour, still weeping,  went to the dressing-room corner, and had a fit of hysterics, concluding with a  dead faint.</p>
<p>Billy the Boy bobbed up a few  moments later. &ldquo;Er fair ole beano!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve dumped Toucher in ther  dust-box for immedjit removal. Spats wanted t&rsquo; send fer the Johns, He&rsquo;s done  Magill in fer &rsquo;er little bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice of authority roared  below, and Billy ducked down again, but Feathers had the whole story before  evening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E bin givin&rsquo; Magill guff erbout  marriage,&rdquo; Mills explained to the town traveller, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; ther spiel was good fer  fifteen jim ther savin&rsquo;s iv er lifetime, which ther dear boy was goin&rsquo; t risk  in ther comfits of a &rsquo;ome, but which &rsquo;e&rsquo;s bounced down et ther two-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That pale maiden lady with the  little lisp?&rdquo; exclaimed Goudy, in amazement. &ldquo;Why, the very thoughts of man  gave her all the unfavourable symptoms mentioned in a quack advertisement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;G&rsquo;out, that sort&rsquo;s sweet &rsquo;n&rsquo;  easy t&rsquo; ther lad that ain&rsquo;t punched off with a frown,&rdquo; retorted Feathers. &ldquo;Her  brother took er tumble, &rsquo;n&rsquo; he&rsquo;s bin here, wantin&rsquo; t&rsquo; hit Cato clean out, &rsquo;n&rsquo;  put him away over ther &rsquo;olidays for false pretensions, &rsquo;r larceny ez er  bailiff, &rsquo;r somethin&rsquo;, only th&rsquo; girl wouldn&rsquo;t hear iv it. She&rsquo;s bin squealin&rsquo;  roun&rsquo; all ther afternoon that Raymond&rsquo;s true to &rsquo;er, true ez true&mdash;she don&rsquo;t  care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The infernal scoundrel,&rdquo; snorted  Goudy. &ldquo;He ought to be hanged!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;s er naughty tease,&rdquo; Mills  soliloquized, &ldquo;&rsquo;n&rsquo; &rsquo;e did Scotty fer er tray-bit&mdash;&rsquo;angin&rsquo;s too good fer him!&rsquo;</p>
