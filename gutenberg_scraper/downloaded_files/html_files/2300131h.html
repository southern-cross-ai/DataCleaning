<p><em>From Hakodate  in the north,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Nagasaki  in the south,<br>
  There&rsquo;s many a gleaming eye and cheek,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And many a rosy mouth.<br>
  And when the long day&rsquo;s task was done,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we from toil were free,<br>
  We sat and watched the yellow sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink in the Yellow Sea.</em></p>
<p><em>The junks still round the headland steep,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers bloom on the hill;<br>
  Chrysanthemum and roses keep<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beauty and fragrance still<br>
  Big ships swing idly in the bay <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From many a stormy main;<br>
  But he who stole from thee away,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall ne&rsquo;er come back again.</em></p>
<p><em>No more the </em>kina<em>, and no  more <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tinkling of guitar:<br>
  Beneath a duller sky he treads,<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath a colder star.<br>
  And yet in fancy beautiful <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He often sits with thee,<br>
  To watch again the yellow sun<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sink in the Yellow Sea. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><strong><a name="LotusSan"></a>Lotus-San</strong></h2>
<p>Lotus-San  stood upon the headland that guards the entrance to the Bay of Nagasaki  and dreamily gazed away to seaward. Above her hung the clouds in pearly  clusters: the sun, sloping away westward, filled the air with a delicious  warmth, and illumined with a broad sheet of light its pathway to the ocean.  Here and there sped the white gulls, occasionally startling the still air with  a hoarse caw: the junks, gaunt birds of a monstrous growth, whipped round the  headland and glided like sentient beings into the smooth water of the harbour.  And the sun saw and smiled upon the labours of men, and lit the eyes of  Lotus-San with wonder and beauty.</p>
<p>And  yet it was none of these things that held the girl&rsquo;s eyes riveted to seaward, though  the great, throbbing scene had a weird influence of its own. Away to the south  she had seen a cloud of smoke, which at first fluttered like a torn ribbon on  the horizon, and this she had watched and watched until that ribbon, woven in  the mysterious loom of the gods, had taken unto itself a black and prodigious  shape, which spread like some uncouth monster across the sea.</p>
<p>But  presently Lotus-San guessed the meaning of that dark cloud, and, as she  watched, the topmasts of a steamer peeped up behind the hill of sea. Then, like  a thing feeling its way, higher and higher it climbed the hill, until it stood  upon the very summit, and she saw its masts and its one big funnel, and the  white line of foam which rose before it as if to check its progress. But on it  swung, straight on for the headland upon which she was standing, the distance  lessening rapidly between it and her. Now she could even distinguish the flag  that flew aft. It was the red English flag, the flag that flew from so many  vessels down in the bay. Presently she almost fancied she could see the men  hurrying hither and thither upon the decks; then from the red funnel there  issued a thick cloud of smoke, which hung like a curtain upon the sea.  Instinctively she closed her eyes.</p>
<p>When  she opened them again, the smoke, fading away in the distance, had risen before  the sun, and a filmy, golden haze greeted her eyes, totally transforming the  face of the waters. The ship, too, had rapidly drawn near, and as it passed  beneath her, her face filled with melancholy, and instinctively her hand went  to her breast. For of a sudden, unknown to her, as it were, a chilliness had  crept into her heart: with the fall of the anchor, which she almost fancied she  could hear, she shuddered, and then turned wearily away.</p>
<p>Time  after time she had seen the ships come and go, a wondering curiosity following  them on their way, a strangeness as of awe filling her for those who go down to  the sea in ships; but never had the coming or going of any vessel so strangely  affected her as the advent of this monster with the red funnel. Her imagination  trifled with it until it became a part of her. From her home on the hillside  she searched the bay for that red funnel. She watched the sampans come and go,  dreaming, dreaming.</p>
<p>Her  mother found her beside the gate, and was much struck by the strange new look  of her daughter&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  ails thee, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the child answered not, because she did not know. With a weary smile she turned  away, and the mother, wise in her generation, shook her head and imagined  things. And still the thoughts of Lotus-San reverted to the ship with the red  funnel, and in her dreams that night she stood once more upon the headland and  saw the smoke-belching monster sweep grandly up out of the sea, glide through  the narrow entrance to the bay and drop anchor. And the sound of the rushing  cable smote a chill on her heart, and she awoke, frightened, and peered up  tremblingly into the night.</p>
<p>Now  the orchard of Otoko, the father of Lotus-San, was famous throughout the whole  of Nagasaki. It  nestled on the side of the hill amid the quaint roofs of the pretty houses, and  commanded an extensive view of the town and the bay. There it was the wandering  tourists toiled upward to drink tea and eat fruit, and as often as not pretty  Lotus-San attended to their wants. And it so happened that on the day following  the arrival of the red-funnel boat, two strangers presented themselves at  Otoko&rsquo;s orchard and begged permission to eat and drink. And Lotus-San, who was  in attendance, brought them tea in quaint little cups without handles, out of  which they drank with excellent Oriental gravity.</p>
<p>She  knew by their talk that the men were English, and but for a certain easy  familiarity of manner might have been father and son. The one was young, tall,  fresh of face and shapely of limb, which was displayed to full advantage in a  knicker suit; the other was short, thick-set&mdash;the average middle-aged man with a  beard.</p>
<p>Of  him Lotus-San thought little; but the younger man was exceedingly good to look  upon. Though she had but stolen a maidenly glance at him, she carried away with  her an impression of blue eyes and fair hair, and a smiling mouth that showed  white teeth. And then, her eyes wandering towards the bay, they became riveted  upon the ship with the red funnel, and of a sudden her hand went to her breast,  and she felt a chill, like a revelation, at her heart. Strange &mdash; strange; but  as she watched she saw the ship climb the hill of sea once more, and again  heard the ponderous cable rattle through the hawse-pipes. With a start she  awoke from her dream. The strangers were calling.</p>
<p>Once  more she stood before them, but this time she was no longer the <em>musum&eacute;</em> the waitress, but a woman with a  secret, a secret ill-defined, no doubt, but to her one of much moment. At all  events, it robbed her of her ease, brought the blushes to her face, and a  fluttering to her heart. Though she never once turned her eyes towards the  younger man, she felt the intensity of his gaze, just as one who lies upon the  grass with shut eyes will feel the sun burning his eyelids.</p>
<p>Neither  spoke Japanese well, but the younger man, who knew least, talked most. But him  Lotus-San ignored, and confined her remarks to the elderly gentleman with the  beard. Elderly gentlemen with beards are so fatherly. Young men must be kept in  their place.</p>
<p>They  wanted some cherries. Could she get them any? Decidedly. She would go at once  and pluck them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will come and help you,&rdquo; said the young man. </p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo;  said his companion.</p>
<p>Lotus-San  bowed low and departed, but from out the corner of her eye she caught a glimpse  of the admiring face of the young man. It was all very strange, this new  sensation, these confused thoughts. Why should her heart palpitate so freely?  Why should thought make her face and neck burn?</p>
<p>As  soon as she had disappeared the two men turned and interrogated each other with  significant glances. The elder man had a pair of quizzing eyes, and as he  looked at his companion he stroked his beard, an action which seemed to add a  singularly penetrative force to his scrutiny. By the almost imperceptible smile  which played about his face, it was evident that he was fairly well acquainted  with the idiosyncrasies of a certain young gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh,  Bob!&rdquo; said the younger of the two, accompanying the exclamation with a nod  towards the orchard.</p>
<p>The  beard wagged slowly. &ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man sprang to his feet with a laugh. He had seen that beard wag before:  it was not the first time he had heard that contemptuous &ldquo;Pooh.&rdquo; Bob was a good  sort, any way. Dear old Bob!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe that silly girl has forgotten our cherries,&rdquo; protested the young man.  &ldquo;I&rsquo;d better go and hurry her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  would if I were you,&rdquo; replied the elder man drily.</p>
<p>Again  the beard wagged, but this time unmarked by smiling eyes. The young man had  taken his companion at his word. Having looked forward with no little pleasure  to the fruit, he was not inclined to forego the sensation of tasting it.</p>
<p>He  discovered her in the far corner of the garden, perched upon an impromptu  pedestal in the shape of a box, struggling hard to reach a cluster of  delicious-looking fruit. For some moments he stood watching her vain efforts to  clutch the bough: then with a smile he advanced.</p>
<p>When  she saw him she blushed still more deeply, and looked about her with a pretty  timidity which appealed to the young man&rsquo;s imagination. Beside the box lay her  little straw sandals; the clean white <em>tabi</em>,  or socks, which enclosed her feet, appeared to him but large enough for a  child. Dainty little feet were hidden, he doubted not&mdash;feet as dainty as the  rest of her dainty person.</p>
<p>Seeing  her embarrassment, and knowing the cause of it, he begged she would permit him  to help her to descend from her precarious position. He held out his hands,  and, after a momentary hesitation, she let him take hers. And here the adventure  did not quite end, for as she leant forward his hands glided round her waist  and she felt a pair of strong arms encompass her. Perhaps, but it might only  have been her fancy, something in the nature of an embrace followed. At all  events, it seemed to her that long after all danger was past he still held her  close to him, and that his embrace was of a singularly warm and protecting  nature. Indeed, instinct bade her free herself, and she accordingly began to  struggle.</p>
<p>He  was wise in experience, if not in years, and he at once apologised with a  profound grace. The box was high, the position extremely dangerous. He would  have been absolutely inconsolable had any harm befallen her. Poor Lotus-San!  The harm was yet to come.</p>
<p>Blushing  and stammering charmingly, she succeeded, though not without some difficulty,  in getting into her sandals, and that effort accomplished, she stood  indecisive, knowing not whether to run or stay. But Fulkes, the foreign devil  in question, was a young gentleman of some knowledge and perception. The  recollection of that embrace had apparently vanished from his memory. It was a  thing of the moment, unavoidable, but now forgotten. He did not even betray by  a look the thought that was rioting in his mind. Timid as a fawn, this dainty  little creature might have dashed off at the first signal of danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold  your <em>kimono</em>&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will gather  the fruit for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,  excellency&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  nay, it is my wish, little flower. I am tall&mdash;see!&rdquo; And he held his arms above  her, and truly to her he seemed great and beautiful as a giant; and she thought  how tenderly those great strong arms had enfolded her, and she wondered at his  gentleness.</p>
<p>But  in the meantime he had sprung upon the box, and the fruit being well within his  reach, he began to pluck it, and slowly to drop the cherries one by one into  her <em>kimono</em>, which she had spread out  for the occasion. And as each cherry fell he looked at her and smiled, and she,  encouraged by the geniality of the white giant, smiled up at him again.</p>
<p>But  when the cherries were plucked he stood upon the box and thoughtfully regarded  the quaint little figure beneath him, and something very like the shades of  irresolution chased each other across his face. Into his eyes crept a strange  softness, and the curves of his mouth grew serious. And Lotus-San, who had  watched him with an intentness which a vain man might have considered  complimentary, let her eyes fall before his concentrated gaze. When she saw him  again he was standing beside her; his blue eyes were sparkling with laughter,  the serious curves had disappeared from his mouth.</p>
<p>He  gallantly escorted her back towards the house, where the middle-aged gentleman  with the beard had been left all this time in solitary state; but not more than  half of the journey had been accomplished before the two came to a standstill.  A gap in the garden disclosed a pretty view of the harbour below, and Fulkes,  stopping for a moment, pointed towards the red-funnel boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  see that ship, Lotus?&rdquo; He had already learnt her name, and in a decorous manner  had duly complimented her on its prettiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she cried. See it! She had seen it day and night&mdash;waking, dreaming&mdash; ever since  it first climbed that hill of sea to the southward. But she trembled,  nevertheless, at the question, and looked more like a lotus than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  arrived yesterday from Hong-Kong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was on the bluff. I watched it come up out of the sea, a strange monster  belching clouds of smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;I was on board.&rdquo; It was more curious than he imagined. Lotus-San&rsquo;s  underlip trembled, and her heart grew chill as with a deadly fear. If he had  not been watching the bay so intently he might have noticed the sudden pallor  overspread her face. As it was, she had somewhat regained her normal colour  when he looked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  he repeated, &ldquo;I was on board her. It is rather strange that we should meet  thus, Lotus-San.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Strange  indeed; and yet she felt that it was not so very strange. Why, she could not  say. Only it was not wonderful that she should meet some one who had come by <em>that</em> ship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  sails to-morrow for Yokohama  direct,&rdquo; he continued, the tone of his voice being well calculated to arouse  one&rsquo;s curiosity, even though the information was not of a paralysing nature.  Yet the girl turned a white, eager face to him as she said&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was going,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but since I have seen you, Lotus-San, I am not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  excellency means&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  I have seen you, Lotus-San, and that I think heaven is nearer Nagasaki  than Yokohama.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  middle-aged gentleman with the beard waited patiently for his cherries. </p>
<p>As  Fulkes had said, or thought, Bob was a good sort, philosophically phlegmatic.  The sun created a drowsy atmosphere, the cheroot burnt well, and the cane chair  in which the philosopher stretched his comfortable bulk bore him without  complaining. But cigars will burn low, and dreams end, and too much green tea  is not good for the digestion. Besides, even the patience born of philosophy,  like all things human, flourishes but to die. Bob didn&rsquo;t get excited, he didn&rsquo;t  even swear, but his patience gave out. With deep regret he dragged himself from  the comfortable recesses of the chair, stretched himself, yawned, looked at his  watch, and then ventured out into the orchard. Those cherries must be getting  cold, he thought.</p>
<p>He  discovered Fulkes and Lotus-San in one of the quietest and most delightful  nooks of the garden. Their attitude did not surprise him. He knew Fulkes, he  knew youth&mdash;he knew himself. There was not the slightest reason why the girl should  blush, and hang her head, and try to look ashamed. Her mother had done the same  before, her own daughter would undoubtedly verify the truism that history  repeats itself. There was nothing in it all&mdash;nothing. Why on earth should Fulkes  look embarrassed? This was painful&mdash; and serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  about those cherries, Fulkes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  thousand pardons, old chap,&rdquo; cried the culprit, laughing just a little  stupidly. &ldquo;But I believe we&rsquo;ve eaten them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo;  was the grim reply. Then he looked at the girl. &ldquo;Rather pretty, Fulkes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather!&rdquo;  echoed the young man. &ldquo;Why, she&rsquo;s lovely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  said the philosopher. &ldquo;Where are my cherries?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  red-funnel boat was to sail at daybreak on the following morning, and that  evening the philosopher discovered Fulkes going ashore with his baggage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s  this?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  not going round to Yokohama  just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  exclaimed the philosopher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cherries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;not  altogether. I find that I needn&rsquo;t be back until the twelfth. The P. and O. boat  will just fit in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!&rdquo;  muttered the philosopher once again; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young man smiled. Fool! Lord, it was heavenly fooling.</p>
<p>When,  on the following morning, he looked through the gap in Otoko&rsquo;s orchard, the  red-funnel boat was nowhere to be seen. He smiled complacently to himself, and  then turned to greet Lotus-San, who came through the perfume of the orchard  towards him, a new and wonderful light in her eyes. Presently he forgot all  about the philosopher and the ship with the red funnel.</p>
<p>The  days passed merrily in Otoko&rsquo;s orchard. The gardener himself was a struggling  man of business; his wife was a shrewd woman who loved the sight of money, who  did not look askance at presents of silks and jewels. And this young foreigner  was generous in the extreme, and Lotus-San was a dutiful daughter&mdash;one who fully  recognised the obligations of filial piety. The wife of Otoko had visions of an  age of ease.</p>
<p>As  for Fulkes, he took up his abode in Otoko&rsquo;s house, and was received with all  the honour which accompanies a big purse. It might be foolish or it might be  wise&mdash;it all depends on the point of view. Fulkes took one view of the  situation; the gardener and his wife another. If each was satisfied, there is  nothing more to be said. The Japanese loves money just as much as his Western  brother. At any rate, the weather was delightful, the orchard was at its best,  and Lotus-San seemed the loveliest flower there. Fulkes passed whole days with  her in the sweet-scented air. The sunshine and the odour of flowers crept into  their blood, into their brain. Lotus-San awoke from the girl to the woman, and  took unto herself a finer air, a fuller dignity. Yet she was as a child in his  hands&mdash;a piece of clay ready to be moulded to his will. Of her he might make  what he chose, whether for good or evil. The thought of such responsibility  often made him pause. It deepened the furrow between his eyes: caused him many  heart-searchings.</p>
<p>He  was but an ordinary man, she a native woman. In the Far   East men do not set women on a pedestal and pretend to worship  with fear and trembling. No doubt it is wrong of them, but they don&rsquo;t. Fulkes  had lightly entered into this compact, believing that he could as lightly break  it off. But in a few days the girl had become a woman, and the woman serious. Intuitively  he guessed that before he came her life had been a blank. He had filled it,  opened wide her eyes, awakened the dormant soul. The sparkling of the eyes, the  glad flushings of the cheeks, the thousand-and-one things he noted, all told  him what he had become to her. And his brow contracted still deeper in thought,  and he was more than sorry that he had not gone on to Yokohama with the philosopher. It was always  the same old tale&mdash;make love and ride away.</p>
<p>But  the parting was bitter&mdash;bitter as death. He hesitated long, fearing for her,  liking not the task; but when it could no longer be avoided, he told her gently  what had to be. Though she must have known that sooner or later it had to come,  while it was yet in the distance it was but a vague, shadowy sort of terror. He  had said, &ldquo;To-morrow I must leave you, Lotus-San,&rdquo; and that to-morrow descended  instantly like a chilly cloud and smote upon her heart. She did not cry, but  she hung cold and lifeless in his arms; and all his tender words, all his warm  kisses, could not bring back the colour to those pallid cheeks. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It  will be long before my lord returns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  I know not,&rdquo; he answered falteringly. &ldquo;Perhaps&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  he will return&mdash;tell me, O my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  could not tell her, even though he knew it would be the more honourable thing  to do. He was sorry for her, and his sorrow made him weak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will come back,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The  look of gratitude she turned upon him made him feel intensely his most  miserable cowardice. He pressed her face close into his breast so as to hide  her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  lord is good,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I will wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  may be long, Lotus-San.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  matters it? My lord has said he will come. I shall wait in night watching for  the sun to burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  should it never burst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall know that my lord has gone to the hakaba [cemetery], whither I shall  quickly follow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  should I forget you, Lotus-San, what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  frank eyes made him feel still more contemptible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  can my lord forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>From  the gap in her father&rsquo;s orchard she saw, as one might see in a dream, her lover&rsquo;s  ship steal across the bay and out into the ocean, and yet she sat exactly in  the spot where he had left her an hour before. The worst of the parting had  taken place the previous day. A few hurried words, a kiss, and he was gone. In  her lap he flung a big roll of bank-notes, also some jewelled pins for her  hair, some trinkets for her wrists. &ldquo;It will soften the blow,&rdquo; he said to  himself. &ldquo;She is sad now, poor little woman, but in a month I shall be  forgotten.&rdquo; </p>
<p>But  if he could have seen her sitting there, the jewels and the money untouched,  unnoticed, he might not have freed his conscience so easily.</p>
<p>Some  time after, the wife of Otoko found her daughter lying senseless by the gap,  and beside her were the trinkets and the money, which the good mother secretly  appropriated before attempting to restore consciousness to her daughter. Then  Lotus-San was borne within doors, where she lay ill for many weeks, the  ceaseless moan upon her poor, pale lips, &ldquo;My lord, O my lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  he came not, and though youth triumphed, it left her but the wreck of her  former self. &ldquo;She will die,&rdquo; the people said; but she knew differently&mdash;if she  could only see him.</p>
<p>One  after the other the days dragged painfully along. Each night she went to sleep with  the half-expressed hope, &ldquo;Tomorrow &mdash; perhaps to-morrow.&rdquo; It was always  to-morrow&mdash;the day that never comes. Many and many an hour she filled the gap in  her father&rsquo;s orchard, watching&mdash;a pitiful picture. One day she saw the  red-funnel boat come in, but it brought no one for her. Nothing ever came for  her. The world was a blank&mdash;dead.</p>
<p>Other  sorrow came to her when her people told her that she would mother a half-breed,  and they taunted her, and made mock of her until life became unbearable. And  yet, in a desperate sort of way, she was secretly glad. &ldquo;When he knows it, he  will come,&rdquo; she said to herself. &ldquo;It is mine&mdash; and his! Ours, all ours! O my  lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  he came not.</p>
<p>One  day a man from the British Consulate presented himself before her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are Lotus-San,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the daughter of Otoko?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  pressed a roll of bank-notes into her hand. She drew back astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is from him,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He has not forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her  poor face flushed vividly. A cry of exultation sprang from her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  man&rsquo;s face fell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  cannot say. Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was always that dreadful word&mdash; &ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  pitiful look of anguish smote him to the heart; yet, sad as it was, he almost  wished he could have answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know not. Only this I know&mdash;he will come no more to Japan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was not certain that she heard aright, or that she rightly understood. And  though long after he had gone she still pondered over his words, she could only  distinctly recollect that last utterance &mdash;&ldquo;He will come no more to Japan.&rdquo;  It beat into her brain, it chilled her heart, it filled the world with  darkness. He would come no more! Never again should she glow in the sunshine of  his smile, feel the touch of that dear arm about her shoulders, listen to the  loved accents of his voice! All was past&mdash;all was gone. There was no sun in  heaven, no light in the world; life had died with him. For since he would come  no more, he must be dead, as nothing but death could keep him from her. And so  she brooded over the thought until it became a reality, and his sad, pale face  looked up at her through the infinite depths of sea.</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>Once  more she stood upon the headland that guards the entrance to the Bay of Nagasaki,  and looked away to seaward; but this time no ship with a red funnel broke the  perfect line of blue. All was still and calm, and as she looked down into the  sea the old vision came back to her, and the sad, pale face of her beloved  seemed to beckon her to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I have waited long, O my lord, and life has been heavy and  void of light. But the night is past, the day is come. Open wide your arms, my  beloved. We are coming&mdash;we are coming&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
<p>The  startled seagull gave a hoarse caw as it beheld the body of Lotus-San cleave  the still waters. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheMusumé"></a>The Musum&eacute;</b></h2>
<p>That  there was a considerable strain of European blood in Asuma-San no one could doubt  who saw her. It showed itself in the grey tinge of the eyes, the comparatively  straight features, the delicacy of her complexion, and the glossy brown hair which  she strove to spoil by parting and pounding in the most approved native  fashion. Yet no blundering vanity could entirely rob of their charm those rich  brown masses, and, judging from the way Asuma-San decorated them with pretty  pins of coral and mother-of-pearl, it was evident that in her own peculiar  manner she was not without some knowledge of their exceeding beauty.</p>
<p>She  was certainly a handsome girl, with a beauty peculiar to the half-breed of the  Ear East. The yellow, after all, is but a darker shade of white, and some  surprising results are often obtained through a judicious mixture of the blood;  surprising, that is, from the physical standpoint; the moral side of the  question, the injudicious mixing of the vices of two nations, had better be  passed over in silence.</p>
<p>Asuma-San  had not a few physical gifts which were sure to attract the admiration of many,  and the attention of all. She was tall, supple, and exceedingly graceful; her  mouth was red and full, and when she laughed she showed two dazzling rows of  teeth. Her cotton <i>kimono</i>, with its  monstrous designs, became her like a royal robe. There was a grace, a dignity  in the figure which no poverty of dress could conceal.</p>
<p>And  yet she was merely a <i>musum&eacute;</i>, a  waitress, at Ninko&rsquo;s famous tea-house in Hiogo; a place much frequented by the  better-class foreign residents of the adjacent Kobe, and also by many of the surrounding  native gentry. Ninko himself, a foxy little man with wicked eyes, was supposed,  by many nefarious methods, rapidly to be making a fortune. At all events, his  house was decidedly the best patronised of any in the town; and if that wasn&rsquo;t  attraction enough for you, a few <i>yen</i> extra would procure a most delightful exposition of the <i>kina</i>&mdash;a dance much appreciated by visitors and the foreign residents.  For Ninko&rsquo;s girls were even more famous than Ninko himself, and while the girls  laughed and posed, Ninko&rsquo;s purse waxed fat.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll  never forget the first day I saw Asuma-San. Moulmaine had called round at my  office with some work which had kept us busy until close upon five o&rsquo;clock.  Then, thinking we had earned a little relaxation, we jumped into our rickshaws  and told the boys to run us out of the town. Instinctively they turned in the  direction of Hiogo, and just as instinctively they drew up before the door of  Ninko&rsquo;s tea-house. I am at a loss to know why it should be so, but unless I  gave my boy a distinct order, I invariably found myself being whirled in the  direction of the famous <i>chaya</i>.</p>
<p>The  accustomed stir and bustle, consequent upon the advent of strangers, followed  our arrival. Some of the girls came out on the verandah, others crowded to the  wide, open windows. Asuma-San bowed us in at the door. At first I paid little  heed to her, my attention being fixed elsewhere; but when I turned to address  Mouhnaine I was startled at the surprised look of admiration which had spread  over his face. My eyes, immediately following his, encountered the glance of  the new girl, Asuma-San.</p>
<p>I  regret to add, but common honesty forces the confession from me, that I  received almost as great a shock as he; but I had not his susceptible nature,  and did not retain an impression of things which were decidedly to my  disadvantage. Yet not alone was the girl exceedingly handsome, but I saw at a  glance that she was a half-breed; and, little as I admire the native, I admit  that there is a fascination about the half-breed Jap or Chow, when of the  feminine gender, which altogether defies analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  wonder where she came from?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  stars. They all do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  Osman; no larks. Have you seen her before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  sat inside against the open window, and Asuma-San brought us the tea in little  transparent cups of quaint design; and Moulmaine insisted upon her drinking  with us, and when he paid I saw him slip a silver <i>yen</i> into her little pink palm. Her eyes shone brightly as she made  a humble obeisance, and with trembling fingers she hid the coin in her broad  sash. Moulmaine, who was usually a man of the utmost prudence, and one not  prone to cheapen himself, sought to persuade her to sit upon his knee; but even  Ninko&rsquo;s girls were, occasionally, not without an assumption of modesty, and  with a deprecating shake of the head she toddled off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  Osman,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what do you think of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was a gloating tone of triumph in his voice which I thought it advisable to  check.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admirable,&rdquo;  I answered slowly, &ldquo;for a half-caste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half-caste  or no,&rdquo; he replied enthusiastically, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s the handsomest girl I&rsquo;ve ever seen.  I should like to know who she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much  better rest content with <i>what</i> she is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re  a beastly old cynic,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, I am just what the world has made me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I know your sort,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;You indulge your own evil propensities,  and then blame the world. But that will not do, Osman. I have never yet blindly  followed precedent, and I don&rsquo;t intend to begin now. Heavens! would you have a  man without a mind of his own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There  are some things in which it is better for a man not to have a mind of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would  you have your friend such a poor creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  would have him wise, Moulmaine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  your wisdom consists of a blind obedience?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  in all things. But it is just possible that wise men have marked a path which  we fools may follow with safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any  way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the world shall not fashion me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obstinacy,  my dear Moulmaine, is not stronger than argument. The world will fashion you  just as it has fashioned me. Are you a creator, think you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To  this extent&mdash;that I can create sufficient for my own needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible.  You would not be content with your creation forty-eight hours. And I will go  further. I will say that not alone can you not create sufficient for your  needs, but that you are not great enough to destroy one little convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  can at least defy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madness.  One may defy God with impunity, but one dare not defy a social convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you preach like this, Osman,&rdquo; said he, rising, &ldquo;I shall have to seek out my  half-caste in self-defence. She, at all events, will not bore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, you never heard me censure you for doing a wise thing. By all  means seek out your half-caste. I rather admire your taste. In fact, I&rsquo;m not  certain that I shan&rsquo;t try to cut you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  went off laughing, and I strolled out on to the verandah and lit a cheroot.  Ninko&rsquo;s verandah was deep and cool, and Ninko&rsquo;s girls were exceedingly  attractive; but all the same, Moulmaine&rsquo;s absence began to look serious, the  more so as he was a good, sober fellow, and of an age that reasons. But it was  this very soberness, or deadly earnestness of the man&rsquo;s nature, which caused me  the most alarm. If he made up his mind to do a thing, I knew he would do it in  spite of the most strenuous opposition. There was a rigid, puritanical justness  and independence about the man which often brought him in conflict with the  world&rsquo;s cherished traditions. Ostensibly he was no whit better than his  fellows; and yet, if one took the trouble to dig beneath the surface, there  would be found a vein of pure gold which would amply repay one for the toil.</p>
<p>Moulmaine,  being a reasonable man, ought to have known better. A boy fresh out from home,  charmed by the novelty of his surroundings, cannot be expected to think. With  net outstretched he chases the dainty butterfly, desperately zealous. But  Moulmaine was a man, and a man who looked upon life seriously, and regarded the  problems of the future with a good deal of reverential awe. Dozens of times we  had been to Ninko&rsquo;s together, yet never had I known him act so erratically. But  I must in fairness admit that never had he met such a girl as Asuma-San.</p>
<p>At  last he returned, looking half-ashamed of himself, and yet half-defiant; but as  he took my chaffing inquiries rather unpleasantly, and as I knew his sense of  humour was not abnormally developed, I instantly desisted. Then I proposed that  we should go, a proposal to which he acquiesced by simply nodding. Clearly  Moulmaine was not himself at all. I had seen many a fellow serious in the  pursuit of a <i>musum&eacute;</i>, but I had never  heard of one who had been allowed to die of apprehension. Moulmaine was  different, or at least he was serious in another way.</p>
<p>I  had invariably found him at the club every afternoon between five and six, but  for quite a week after our visit to Ninko&rsquo;s I saw neither sight nor sign of  him. For the first two or three days I thought nothing of this, taking it for  granted that a sudden rush of business had kept him away. But as the days ran  into a week, I instituted inquiries among the servants, and to my amazement I  learnt that he had not been near the club during the whole of that period. Then  I feared that he must be ill, for I could not otherwise explain an absence so  unusual. I therefore hastened round to his office, and to my inquiry if Mr.  Moulmaine was in, learnt that he had just gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  he is not ill?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious.  I thought he must have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  spoke like one speaking to oneself; but the clerk, a promising young Jap,  answered with an odd shake of the head, &ldquo;No, sir, he is not ill.&rdquo; But he looked  something more, and his tone was full of meaning.</p>
<p>I  saw that the rascal wanted to speak, but I had no intention of discussing with  him his master&rsquo;s secrets; so I told him to let his master know that I had  called, and that I had something of importance to communicate, which was not a  fact; but in a way I wished to justify my solicitude.</p>
<p>Unfortunately,  this statement seemed to be the very thing for which the clerk was waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  it, is very important,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the master will be found at Ninko&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed!&rdquo; said I, professing to be highly gratified with this surprising piece  of intelligence. &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  master is always at Ninko&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>This  was serious. I had almost forgotten Asuma-San and my friend&rsquo;s admiration for  her. Curiously enough, if I had thought of it at all, I had judged him from my  own level. But I had been greatly mistaken. The steady, sober-sided Moulmaine  had evidently fallen in love with the <i>musum&eacute;</i>.  Fortunately such love was not serious, and Asuma-San was worthy of some  attention; though I often doubt the wisdom of that man who teaches a woman her  worth.</p>
<p>Though  it was getting rather late, I jumped into my rickshaw and ran out to Ninko&rsquo;s,  and there, in the garden at the back of the house, I discovered the delinquent  Moulmaine with the girl Asuma-San. As I appeared before them she started,  uttered a little cry, and would have run away; but he held her fast by the  hand, and even drew her to him and flung his arm about her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  this is it,&rdquo; I cried. &ldquo;I thought you were very ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  I have been, old chap; but, thank God, I&rsquo;m better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Truly  I had always regarded him as the possessor of an odd personality; but I thought  it highly incongruous to use God&rsquo;s name in connection with an affair of this  nature. It implied a justification, and looked more serious and solemn than I  liked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  do you thank God?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  He has helped me to be a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  looked at the woman, and some very different thoughts entered my head. Still,  many a decent fellow has gone to the devil under the mistaken impression that  he is being a man. I could be lenient, for I had known something of the  feeling; but, thank heaven, I had never let it wholly conquer my innate  selfishness.</p>
<p>His  treatment of the girl was inexpressibly tender; so different from anything I  had ever seen under like conditions that I was perfectly amazed. His face  actually seemed to beam as he looked at her, and a light no sinner could  possibly comprehend shone in his eyes. It was a look full of infatuated folly,  or reverence&mdash; I could not say which. The man was blindly, idiotically, in love.</p>
<p>But  the woman, even as she nestled to him, seemed uncomfortable, and stole at me  strange, inquiring glances from mistrustful eyes. To my thinking they were  cold, calculating eyes without any depth of soul, and I wondered how Moulmaine  could not see it&mdash;until I recollected the proverbial blindness of love. I  believe she followed pretty closely the thoughts that were running in my mind,  and from the frequent flashes of suspicion with which she regarded me I knew  she doubted my friendship. Nor was she far wrong, if, as I imagined, she had  some interested motive in view.</p>
<p>Moulmaine  and I left the tea-house together, I very considerately allowing him a long  five minutes with his beloved. As the night was fine, I suggested that we  should walk, for I had something on my mind and wished to get rid of it. The  suggestion he welcomed, which was good: then we set out, our rickshaw coolies  following some distance behind.</p>
<p>I  at once, assuming the prerogative of an old friend, which is not always wise,  attacked him on his desertion of the club and the frequency of his visits to  Ninko&rsquo;s, and as he stammered somewhat inconsistently in his reply, I boldly  broached the subject of Asuma-San, and in a way that must have been anything  but agreeable to him. He stood my badinage well enough, but when I spoke  seriously of the indifferent fame of Asuma-San and her class, he, stopped me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  take too much for granted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I believe that Asuma-San is a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  always were one of those humbugs who profess to see good in everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if I thought you half the callous, selfish brute you pretend to be, do you  suppose I would still call you my friend? Do you remember, about three years  ago, when a certain Moulmaine lay sick unto death with fever? His friends  forsook him; the doctor, even, was afraid of catching the infection. But there  was a surly, growling old bear called Osman, who was mother, friend, doctor,  all in one.&rdquo; And he laid his hand lovingly on my shoulder. &ldquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t speak!  Let me remember, Osman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rubbish!&rdquo;  I replied, though that loving hand on the shoulder had brought the cursed tears  close to my eyes. &ldquo;That was nothing. This is serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very  serious,&rdquo; he answered solemnly.</p>
<p>I  was startled. What the deuce did he mean by taking such a solemn tone?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  thought I knew you, Moulmaine; but I am not so certain of it now. What do you  mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely  this, my dear Osman, I&rsquo;m going to back my faith.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am going to make Asuma-San my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course; and a very pretty wife she&rsquo;ll make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are mistaken, Osman,&rdquo; he replied, with a quiet earnestness which was highly  effective. &ldquo;I am going to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope you are going to do nothing of the kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think so, nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are serious, Moulmaine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though  I put the question, I had little doubt of the genuineness of his declaration.  And he was just the man to put it into effect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  God help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe He will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We  walked on and on through the night, and in the fulness of my anxiety I used  every argument of which I was master to dissuade him from committing such a  deadly piece of folly; but all my thunderbolts were shattered against the  impregnable rock of his belief. Once only did I think he was wavering, and that  was when he condescended to admit that Asuma-San was not altogether a native;  but he repented of the weakness almost immediately after, and protested that,  even if she were, it would make no difference. I could not tell him that it was  better for a woman to have the failings of one nation than the vices of two.</p>
<p>I  am prepared to admit that to him my argument must have sounded detestable. </p>
<p>Yet  I spoke the truth&mdash;cruel and selfish as it was&mdash;the truth gained from bitter  experience. Philanthropy is a good thing in its way, and there is something infinitely  noble in the abstract theory of the universal brotherhood of man; but resolve  that theory to its elements, or put it to practical use, and its inherent folly  is colossal. But Moulmaine had faith, that faith which levels mountains. And  was he so much less fortunate than I?</p>
<p>The  next thing I heard was that he had married Asuma-San, and that he had set up  housekeeping in a neat little bungalow on the hill at the back of the town.  During the next month or so I accidentally met him once or twice, and from his  manner I judged that he had not quite forgotten my plain-speaking. However, the  deed was done and I had had my say, so I merely referred in the most casual way  to his marriage, quickly perceiving that this was a subject which permitted of  no trifling. Nor did I refer to his desertion of the club, or the dropping of  old friends. Things, no doubt, would right themselves in their own good time.</p>
<p>Then  one evening he called on me and took me up to his house to dinner, and once  again I saw Asuma-San, now grown stately with the dignity of her new life. And  very beautiful she looked, and in a way I thought Moulmaine was a lucky beggar;  but she was a native, a native body and soul, and nothing could alter that. Out  of deference to him she had pounded less fat into her hair, but she still wore  the national <i>kimono</i>, while nothing  could persuade her to wear shoes and stockings. In fact, at heart she was still  the <i>musum&eacute;</i> of Ninko&rsquo;s tea-house, and  I had no doubt that she would willingly have exchanged all her solitary splendour  for the tinkle of the <i>samisen</i>, and  the laughter and the life.</p>
<p>She  received me with chilling coldness, but that I looked upon as a matter of  course, for I had been anything but a friend to her. Still I tried my best to  be civil, remembering her altered condition, and treated her with a  consideration which should have rendered her more amicable. But I saw that she  neither forgot nor forgave, and she went about with a childish pout on her  lips, or sat silent and sullen.</p>
<p>As  I shook hands with Moulmaine at parting, I said, &ldquo;You are happy, old fellow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  there was a tone in his voice that did not please me. It was too assertive to  be convincing.</p>
<p>Though  we did not meet again for many weeks, his neglect did not anger me. I knew that  when he wanted me he would come. Then one day, as I was walking towards  Ninko&rsquo;s, I stepped aside to make room for a rickshaw which came dashing through  the narrow street. Curiosity prompting me to turn round, I caught a hurried  glimpse of Moulmaine as he flashed by. I saluted, but he did not seem to see  me, though his eyes were apparently staring straight into mine. Mad eyes they  were, full of rage and horror. I called to him, but he did not heed me. Then a  turn in the street hid the flying vehicle.</p>
<p>I  passed on full of strange conjecture, wondering, fearing. That something  dreadful had happened was obvious; that something dreadful would happen was  equally certain. His face haunted me; I could not close my eyes upon the livid  picture.</p>
<p>Some  eight or ten minutes later I met him again. This time his wife was in the  rickshaw with him. His face was still deadly pale; but hers was black and  sulky, and most evil and ugly in its anger. I guessed in a moment what it  meant. He had been to Ninko&rsquo;s to fetch her home.</p>
<p>With  something more to think about I continued my way to the tea-house; but though I  carefully inquired I could learn nothing. Ninko was a clever man, and his <i>chaya</i> was always beyond reproach.</p>
<p>One  night, a week or so after this, just as I was thinking of going to bed, there  came a great rapping at my door, and when I opened it, in rushed Moulmaine in a  fearful state of excitement. His face was more hideously pale than ever, his  eyes glared wildly; he was without hat, coat, or collar. He never spoke, but  with a moan sank into a chair. Quickly I mixed him some whisky-and-water, which  he gulped in a way that nearly choked him. Then, slowly regaining his breath,  he looked up at me and in a hoarse voice gasped, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it, Osman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done  what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed  her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something  cold smote my heart and sent the shivers flying through me. But I would not  understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed  whom?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  wife&mdash;Asuma-San.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man,  you are mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  a bit of it,&rdquo; and he arose, laughing diabolically. I backed away. &ldquo;I was mad, &ldquo;Osman,&rdquo;  he went on, still laughing like one who enjoys a pleasant memory; &ldquo;but the  madness has worn off, I tell you, you son-of-a-gun, the madness has worn off,&rdquo;  and he brought his hand down with a murderous clap upon my shoulder. &ldquo;I am sane  now, old cynic, and see with clear eyes. But you understand, I wanted to do the  right thing. I tried to bribe heaven with a monstrous bribe. God would have  none of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calm  yourself,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;and tell me what has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  know how I loved her, Osman&mdash; what I did for her? Had she possessed but one  little virtue she would at least have pitied me. But one cannot gather grapes  from thorns. Though I had long known her for what she was, I still tried to  deceive myself. The <i>musum&eacute;</i> was always  the <i>musum&eacute;</i>. The poison of Ninko&rsquo;s den  was in her blood; the smell of the place was as the breath of life to her. So  she went there day after day, until at last I heard of it. Then I followed her,  and brought her forth, and she sobbed and begged hard to be forgiven; and  remembering what she was, I pardoned her. But she had tasted of the vileness  once again, and neither threat nor fear could check her. And then, I know not  exactly how it came about, but we quarrelled deeply, furiously, and my hands  found their way to her throat, and presently I was staring into the vacant eyes  of a dead woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was the mad story he poured into my ears, and when he had finished he drank  deeply of the whisky and laughed at my troubled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have committed murder; but I also know that it is justified  of God, no matter what man may say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  would not sit down, he would not stay; and when I tried a little gentle  persuasion he shook me off with a savage oath, flung open the door, and passed  out into the night.</p>
<p>His  body was found next morning in the little garden at the back of his own  bungalow. A revolver with one empty chamber lay beside him. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="AtTheShrineOfShinto"></a>At The  Shrine Of Shinto</b></h2>
<p>Hanu-San  knelt before the great Shinto shrine and prayed to the Master-of-the-August-Centre-of-Heaven.  Pain had been hers, pain wrought of the deep anguish of bitter thoughts, and  her soul was full of sorrow and her eyes were shaded with melancholy. For she  had reached that age when maidens wed, and her beauty had found favour in the  eyes of Sakata&mdash; Sakata of the hundred junks and many houses; and he had dreamed  of her, and his dreams had filled his brain with restlessness and his heart  with a great desire.</p>
<p>Being  rich, he had the courage of riches. It mattered nothing that he was old, that  his limbs were shrunken, that his lips were blue, that his little black eyes  were lost behind innumerable yellow wrinkles. He counted his <i>yen</i> by the thousand; he was lord of a  hundred junks, of many people. Those who did not love him bowed low in his presence;  deep salutations greeted him as he passed along the street. &ldquo;There goes the  honourable Sakata,&rdquo; the people would whisper one to the other, &ldquo;he who fills  many mouths.&rdquo; And in this lay the cause of all reverence: &ldquo;He who fills many  mouths.&rdquo; His faults were many, his person unlovely, his manners uncouth. Of him  tales had been told which reflected little credit on humanity. They said he had  no heart, no feeling; that when he died one more spirit-wolf would join the  spectral band which haunted the mountain recesses. But they said these things  in whispers, for Sakata was a man with whom no one dared to trifle.</p>
<p>Of  him, then, Hanu-San thought as she knelt before the shrine, and in her dumb,  dull way called the gods to her aid. Not that she was wholly without fear of  the efficacy of prayer. Her mother had said, &ldquo;It is time that thou shouldst wed  and rear sons to the glory of thy lord. The honourable Sakata hath exceeded  condescension in casting his august eyes on our contemptible offspring. The  gods are truly blessing the house of Naku, the compradore.&rdquo; Her father had  added, &ldquo;Worthless though we be, and as dirt in the eyes of the gods, yet are we  singled out for this great happiness. The honourable Sakata is the lord of a  hundred junks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo;  echoed his wife, &ldquo;and of a hundred houses as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  Hanu-San knew that here the gods themselves were of no avail. They, as she,  were powerless against a hundred junks. The halo that surrounded Sakata no  cloud could diminish.</p>
<p>And  yet she knelt and prayed, but with a doubting soul. Your Oriental is more or  less of a fatalist, and what the gods have once written they will in no wise  blot out. Moreover, it was the wish of her honourable parents, and to thwart  that wish would have been a crime beyond all pardon. If there is any religion  in Japan  it is that of, filial obedience&mdash;obedience, first of all, to the Emperor, by  whose exceeding magnanimity one lives, for whom it would be a pleasure and an  honour to die; then comes obedience to one&rsquo;s parents, and, when one marries,  the reverence of the mother-in-law. Fortunately, and in this Hanu-San  discovered some consolation, Sakata had buried his honourable mother some  twenty years before.</p>
<p>She  knew that it was sinful, this appeal to the gods in opposition to the wishes of  her parents; but her mind was beginning to expand, and life was presenting its  right and its wrong side, and she thought of what ought to be and what was. And  a long dwelling on what was kindled the smouldering embers of rebellion, and  all else failing, she appealed to the infinite justice of the gods. But the  ways of the divine ones were ever inscrutable, and even as she prayed she knew  it was a futile thing she asked, and her selfish and unfilial conduct filled  her with shame and apprehension. Her duty was clear, her obedience to the  parental wishes assured. How could the gods look with benign eyes upon one  whose soul was charged with angry and rebellious thoughts? She would claim  pardon; she would fulfil the wishes of her parents, even to entering the arms  of Sakata, the lord of a hundred junks. She would&mdash;</p>
<p>Here  she raised her head, her heart throbbing with a new and noble resolution, and,  behold! her eyes fell upon the figure of a man who stood back some little way,  regarding her intently. At first, owing to a quick, uncertain glance, she  thought the figure was one of the priests from the adjacent temple, and for  fear of incurring his displeasure she made a pretence of continuing her  devotions; but the man&rsquo;s form came between her and the gods, and in a way he  seemed to read her thoughts, and she trembled like a child who is suddenly  discovered in mischief.</p>
<p>Intuitively,  for she had not the courage to look, she felt the presence draw near, and the  strange throbbing of her pulses told her that it was no priest. In fact, she  knew it now, even by that timid glance, in which he was seen silhouetted as  something dark and big against the sky. Her imagination carried her even  farther than that. Was he of her country?</p>
<p>She  tried to think, but her brain whirled confusedly. Lower she bowed her head; she  sought to interpose between her and this stranger the faces of the gods, those  vague, mysterious deities who lived in clouds and rode upon the typhoons; but  the effort proved unavailing. The gods were but shadowy substances at best:  this stranger was a tangible reality.</p>
<p>Then  she became conscious of the fact that a voice was whispering softly in her ear,  and at first she scarcely knew if the accents were human or divine; but her  agitation quickly passing, she recognised the commonplace words of everyday  greeting uttered with a foreign tongue.</p>
<p>Her  agitation was, if possible, even more profound; but it was of an entirely  different nature. Hitherto she had been subdued by the strength of her  spiritual aspirations; she had wandered in the realms of imagination, had  trodden the borderland of the unknown, and her steps had been slow and her feet  had faltered; but this voice and this presence recalled her to earth, and with  a pretty show of confusion she began to scramble to her feet. Then it was,  almost unknown to her, a hand grasped hers, and her burning palm slipped into  his&mdash;so cool, so steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do  not be alarmed,&rdquo; he said, a deep sincerity in every tone of his voice; for he  saw her terror, and he had had some experience of the timidity of these strange  little creatures. &ldquo;I assure you there is nothing to be afraid of. I am merely a  stranger who has come to see&mdash;who has come to learn.&rdquo; He dropped her hand as he  spoke, and she, feeling herself at liberty, had a great inclination to dash  away from this presumptuous stranger with the soft voice, who stumbled so  charmingly with her language. But her dignity and better sense came to the  rescue; perhaps her feminine curiosity had not a little to do with the  determination. Perhaps, also, the gods, who worked in a way unknown to mortals,  had not turned a deaf ear to her prayers. Perhaps&mdash;but her soul almost sickened  with terror at the awful, the sacrilegious thought&mdash;perhaps the god himself, the  Master-of-the-August-Centre-of-Heaven, had&mdash;</p>
<p>With  a strange throbbing of the breast she raised her eyes slowly from the ground,  whereon was firmly planted a pair of white boots, and as her glance began  slowly to ascend the legs of the deity, she thought they were monstrous long,  and totally unlike those of the men of her own race. But even as she thought,  her glance continued its upward course, and presently she was looking into a  pair of earnest eyes, the colour of which seemed to have been stolen direct  from the farthest blue of the ocean.</p>
<p>The  face was fair, white as she had dreamed the face of a god should be, and the  thick golden hair fringed it as with an aureole. Amazement sat upon her face:  indecision flickered across it in little hurrying waves of shadow and shine.  Conscious of this unprecedented encounter, and of the proper behaviour of young  ladies under such conditions, she hesitated to leave, impelled thus to defy the  laws of decorum by a power which she felt acutely, but which she was utterly  unable to analyse. And he saw her irresolution, and the smile deepened in his  eyes and brightened his whole face, and in a vague way Hanu-San thought of the  sun sinking in the sea.</p>
<p>He  stumbled atrociously with the language as he attempted to propitiate her, to  still her fears; but she found his strange phrasing and mispronunciation  delightfully quaint and fresh, and she would not have had him speak in any  other fashion for the world. Moreover, she discovered, after the first shock of  nervousness had passed away, and she could listen with something like  tranquillity, that he was English, and she delighted him, in reply to one of  his questions, by answering him in his native tongue. For was she not the  daughter of Naku, the compradore, he who traded with the English, who spoke  their language with fluency? And had she not wished to know something of these  people of the West, and striven to learn that language which everyone seemed to  speak?</p>
<p>Castleton,  the voyager in question, was overjoyed at the discovery, and henceforth  eschewed all attempts to make himself understood in Japanese. It is enough for  the Englishman that other people should struggle with his language; he never  discloses any great inclination to battle with theirs. When Hanu-San fought  valiantly with a word he came to her rescue; but her pretty struggles pleased  him infinitely, and he was cruel enough to prolong her exquisite agony to the  full.</p>
<p>Once  her restraint had worn off she prattled glibly in an odd mixture of English and  Japanese. She would begin solemnly enough with the foreign language, but she  invariably finished at express speed in her native tongue. And though he did  not thoroughly understand her, he learnt that she was the daughter of Naku, the  compradore, he who provided the victuals for the great English ships. As he had  never heard of the honourable Naku, the information contained nothing of much  importance. The chief point was that she was somebody&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>He  looked at the quaint little doll-like figure, and even through her loose <i>kimono</i> saw the budding girl was  blossoming into the rose of woman. Perhaps she was not entirely pretty&mdash;he had  never become quite reconciled to the strange eyes with the puffy lids&mdash;but her  complexion was good, her mouth full and fresh and pouting like a child&rsquo;s, and  when she smiled she was wholly charming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  name?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How shall I call you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanu-San.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hanu-San,&rdquo;  he repeated, admiration and pleasure blending with singular adroitness in his  look. &ldquo;An appropriate name, indeed, for you are just the sweetest flower that I  have ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  blushed, but at the same time solemnly shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  your excellency, I am but a poor creature who has incurred the anger of the  gods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  gods,&rdquo; said he disdainfully, &ldquo;are old, and deaf, and blind. What have they to  do with thee, Hanu-San, with living flesh and blood? We go our way in spite of  them, living, as the birds sing, the trees put forth their leaves, the sun  rises and sets&mdash;simply because we must. All things in nature pursue their  appointed course, and we, that are a part of nature, shall we not walk rightly,  guided by the spirit which is within us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor  Hanu-San could not quite grasp the subtlety of such fine argument; but through  the confusion of words and images she caught a fleeting vision of that vague  something which, on more than one occasion lately, had flashed through her own  brain; and she was aware that the stranger, or the essence of him, was entering  her soul through her eyes, and unconsciously she abandoned herself to the  strange, delicious process.</p>
<p>An  hour after they passed down beneath the great <i>torii</i>, or granite archways, which are the invariable symbol of  Shintoism, that old, vague, ill-remembered form of worship which is called a  religion; but this time his arm was thrown caressingly about her shoulders, and  many times he stopped, irresolute, and gazed into her face with doubting looks;  but she smiled up at him, and the sunshine danced in her eyes, and lit with a  deeper scarlet her lips; and the man drew her suddenly to him and pressed her  face into his breast. There was a pathos, a trustfulness in those clear eyes  which overwhelmed him with a knowledge of his own guilt.</p>
<p>But  the weakness, as he called it, quickly passed, and presently he remembered  nothing but that this fantastic little doll was a living, breathing woman&mdash;a  creature in whom was the pleasure and the pain of life. So he pressed her  closer, and kissed her, until she wondered at his passion; and when she  stumbled, he caught her up in his arms, nor would he release her until he had  reached the very bottom of the long flight of steps. And then, all panting and  blushing, and burning with an unknown fire, Hanu-San was set upon her feet, and  for some moments she had not the courage to look into those eyes which were so  like the sea. But it was delightful&mdash;all this strange whirl of excitement. Her  soul would ever remain within the embrace of those strong arms.</p>
<p>He  accompanied her for still a little way until he noticed that she began to cast  uneasy glances about her; then he stopped and took her hand, and once more  searched her eyes for the soul which had already filled them with a new light.  But the doglike, wondering pathos of the look touched him keenly. He would  rather her eyes were not quite so serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will come to-morrow, Hanu-San,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;at the same hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  hesitated, but only for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will come,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He  watched the quaint little figure as it descended the hill towards the town;  then as it disappeared entirely he sat himself upon one of the great granite  steps, lit a cheroot, and began to think.</p>
<p>He  had only arrived at the port the day before. Coming from Yokohama,  where he had spent the last twelve months of his life, he had intended to stay  in Nagasaki for one week prior to his departure  for England.  Old friends were to be looked up, visits to be repaid, general farewells  exchanged. In a week the southern-bound steamer would call and take him to  Hong-Kong, there to join the greater home boats. He had spent some happy months  in Dai Nippon, or Great Japan, as the natives proudly call their country. He  would have some pleasant memories to take back with him&mdash;and, possibly, one  regret.</p>
<p>The  panorama that opened out beneath him was an exceedingly fair one&mdash;the far-stretching  picturesque town, the masses of foliage, and the blue bay, upon the waters of  which the light junks scudded to and fro and the great steamers lay asleep. But  he saw all these things with the eye only; his brain was full of the image of a  doll-like figure in a blue-and-white <i>kimono</i>.  And he wondered what he ought to do. Curiosity had led him to explore the  temple. As he passed up beneath the great <i>torii</i>,  his thoughts were chiefly concerned with his voyage and his home-greeting. It  was not until he beheld the devout form of Hanu-San bowed before the shrine  that they took another turn. Then, for the time being, voyage, and home, and  every other thought was obliterated. Was it not strange that just on the eve of  his departure he should have met her? There was no consistency in fate.</p>
<p>But  the next day, at the self-same hour, he toiled once more towards the shrine,  and as he approached the great gaunt <i>torii</i> he almost wished that she might not be there. But this was not to be. All  athrob with an anxiety the like of which had hitherto been a stranger to her,  she had requested permission to ascend once more to the shrine, and as she even  sounded the name of Sakata in a tone of maidenly reverence, the permission was  at once accorded. Slowly, and with the utmost circumspection, she bowed herself  from the august presence of her honourable mother; but once she had begun her  ascent of the hill her speed increased in spite of stumbles and hard breathing.  He might be there, or he might have been there and gone! Both thoughts seemed  to have an equally disastrous effect.</p>
<p>But  he was not there, and she knew not if he had been, and a long bitter wait was  hers, her heart beating with sickening suspense. The shrine was before her, but  the gods were not those of yesterday. Another had come to fill their place&mdash;one  whose hair was charged with the gold of sunset, whose eyes were as blue and as  fathomless as the sea.</p>
<p>At  last she caught a glimpse of him as he mounted the path towards her, and every  nerve of her seemed to leap with a mighty bound, and for a moment her vision  was blurred as by a mist. She could not understand this strange and sudden  throbbing; she never sought to; but long after she remembered it, and life  would gladly have been given for such another sensation, even though she knew  not if the grip upon her heart was one of pleasure or of pain.</p>
<p>His  greeting was inexpressibly tender; she nestled to him as a child might to its  parent, and he, looking down at her, wrinkled his brow with thought. Then he  stopped, irresolute, and held her away from him, and looked at her so  strangely, so fiercely, that she trembled, wondering what she had done. But  suddenly he threw up his head and laughed somewhat bitterly to himself. Then,  seizing her hand, together they walked amid the trees and the flowers; and the  birds sang to them, and the sun leapt into the eyes of Hanu-San and lit her  face with happiness. And he said to her, &ldquo;Know you me, O Hanu-San?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  was at a loss for a suitable reply, because she did not wholly understand the question,  but she smiled reassuringly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is very strange, but I seem to have known your excellency for many days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  as I am?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  you are?&rdquo; she echoed. &ldquo;Ay, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  saw she did not understand. Why should he make her? Again that hesitant,  irresolute look showed itself in his eyes. Then he sneered at his own weakness.</p>
<p>And  so for the five succeeding days, at the self-same hour, Hanu-San toiled upward  to the shrine, and her parents marked with pleasure this proof of devotion in  their daughter, and spoke repeatedly of the honourable Sakata and his hundred  junks. And that daughter listened with a grave face, as became a maiden who was  so highly honoured. It was a momentous event, this union with the illustrious  Sakata, and no doubt the thought of it robbed her of the power of making an  adequate reply. But the dazzle of her approaching greatness added a lustre to  her stupidity. It was evident that she had not intelligence enough rightly to  appreciate the magnificent condescension of Sakata; but she was young, and to  such the gods are forbearing.</p>
<p>And  so each day the quaint little figure toiled its way upward with a beating  heart. Sometimes the thought of Sakata obtruded its hateful presence, and  filled her breast with pain; but it only needed a glimpse of the well-beloved  figure near the shrine to banish the hateful sensation. With her hand in his  there was no longer any fear or trouble in the world. Even Sakata was but the  memory of a bad dream, which was shadowed but indistinctly in the mist of things.</p>
<p>And  so the days flew all too rapidly, and never once had she breathed the name of the  illustrious owner of the hundred junks, and Castleton had but hinted vaguely at  the date of his departure; but now the time had drawn horribly near, and his  manliness forbade him longer to conceal the fact.</p>
<p>He  regretted that he had not spoken sooner, that he had not gently approached the  subject, and so by degrees have prepared her for the inevitable. Yet she would  probably accept the news with the stoicism of her race, that Oriental fatalism  which explains every incongruity. It is written. Who shall gainsay the wisdom  of the gods?</p>
<p>After  many ineffectual attempts at an opening, he said, &ldquo;Know you, O Hanu-San, that  to-morrow morning the <i>Mindoro</i> will  arrive from Kobe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;  she said. What had she to do with the <i>Mindoro</i> or Kobe? Her  heaven was here&mdash;here in Nagasaki.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo;  he continued, rather nervously, &ldquo;and to-morrow evening she leaves for Hong-Kong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  still she was not interested. Ships were always coming and going. Surely they  were built for no other purpose?</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  Hong-Kong,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;You do not seem to understand?&rdquo; </p>
<p>Some  strange note in his voice arrested her attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  understand,&rdquo; she said, perhaps a little nervously. &ldquo;To-morrow evening the <i>Mindoro</i> will  sail for Hong-Kong. Is that not so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.  In three weeks she will be back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said he, &ldquo;that is true; the ship will be back&mdash;but she will not return with all  the people she took away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  for the first time her breast responded with a chill throb to the strange tone  his voice had assumed, and she seemed to realise that under this apparently  trivial piece of information there lay a serious meaning. Her eyes sought his,  and in them he saw a look of pitiful anxiety. The mouth, too, quivered  painfully as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  do not understand,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  felt her little hands close tightly on his. They were throbbing and burning  like fire; but as he spoke they grew, oh, so cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have  you forgotten that I am but a visitor?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My home is away, away in the  West. I could not stay here always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ay,  to be sure. And yet she had not thought of it. The delight of the day had  brought her sweet dreams in the night. Her life was full of dreams, of hopes,  of soft sensations. Why should it not always be thus?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  had already booked my passage in the <i>Mindoro</i>&rdquo; he continued, sparing himself nothing&mdash;her  nothing, though he saw her face pale and felt her hands tremble. &ldquo;I must go  home, Hanu-San; it is imperative. That is what I meant when I said that the <i>Mindoro</i> would  not bring back all those people she took away. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she gasped; but she staggered as though she would fall. He caught her, and  their eyes met; but to the longest day of his life Castleton will be haunted by  the stricken pathos of that look.</p>
<p>Slowly,  and for the last time, they descended beneath the great <i>torii</i> together. His arm was about her as before; the vague  suggestion that he was murmuring words of consolation stole into her numbed  brain; but the birds no longer sang; the sun, fierce as it had been a moment  ago, now failed to warm the chilly air. The trees waved their phantom arms  before her and flung cold shadows into her eyes; the rustle of the leaves  sounded like a jeer at human hopes. Below she saw the bay and the ships as  through a haze. Hateful bay! hateful ships! But for them he would not have  come; but for them he could not go.</p>
<p>They  stopped at the old parting of the ways, and again he sought to render her  consolation; but the pathos of her eyes stole right into his heart and stilled  his tongue. He could not say what he did not mean. It would have been too  pitiful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  lord will come again?&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo;  he answered.</p>
<p>She  bowed low and pressed his hand to her forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have been yours,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;and you mine, and so it shall be for all  eternity. I have looked into your eyes, O my lord, and the sunshine of your  glance has dazzled me. But the gods are good. I thank them for this glimpse of  paradise. It is written. <i>Sayonara</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Sayonara</i>&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>It  was the last word of farewell.</p>

<p>Hallerton  lived in Tokio, and Glynton in Shanghai, and the  latter, after many a keen disappointment, at last turned his face eastward and  steered for Chrysanthemum   Land. Only six weeks  could be spared, but in that time an energetic man may accomplish much.  Glynton, albeit of a staid and resolute exterior, was an energetic man. He made  little noise, but he moved swiftly and with precision, the result of which was  that he saw much, accomplished much&mdash;and carried away with him one everlasting  memory.</p>
<p>He  was no stranger to Japan,  but he had been a stranger for three years, and his first glimpse of the  country awakened many pleasant recollections. There was Nagasaki  crowded with old memories; the beautiful inland sea; Kobe, and Ninko&rsquo;s <i>chaya</i>, and the tinkling of the <i>samisen</i> and the mellower note of the <i>koto</i>.  Then came Yokohama   Bay and the capital  beyond.</p>
<p>Hallerton  received him with open arms and took a week&rsquo;s holiday in his honour, and they  went on excursions into the country, or sailed on the Bay of Yedo,  and lived generally like two boys just let loose from school.</p>
<p>But  this had to end, and for the next week Glynton was left for the greater part of  the day alone, his friend being called on business to Yokohama every morning. Glynton, however, was  a man who could tolerate his own company, and as it was that time of the year  when the land is aglow with cherry-blossoms white and red, and when every  breath inhaled, laden with the perfume and the sunshine, is a delicious  intoxicant, he found his aimless little excursions into the surrounding country  profitable and invigorating.</p>
<p>On  one occasion, wandering with no fixed purpose, his steps led him to surmount a  little hill which, though it lay back some distance from the water, still  commanded an extensive view of the bay and the surrounding country. He began a  slow ascent of this hill, for the sun was warm and the dust lay thick on the  road, and he felt inclined to loiter by the way; but the cool green and white  of his goal held out an invitation which he could not resist.</p>
<p>Slowly  he trudged upward until he came to where a narrow footway branched off from the  main road, and, as the former looked the more inviting of the two paths, he  took it, though not without a feeling that he was encroaching on private  property. However, that troubled him but little, and even if it had caused him  much concern it is doubtful if his curiosity would have bowed to his  discretion. For, insensibly as it were, a desire to penetrate this mound of  flowers and of leaves had come to him, and one that he knew it would be  necessary to gratify. </p>
<p>As  he made his way upward the foliage thickened, and presently, the path taking a  sudden bend, he found himself before a small clearing, in the midst of which  was the daintiest little bandbox of a house that he had ever seen. Startled, he  drew back, and through the leaves peered like a guilty creature at the pretty  picture. The house was like a toy embedded in blooms. Flowers innumerable shone  from every point of vantage, while the heavy perfume of the fruit trees stole  towards him in a golden cloud. The day was so still that he seemed to hear the  multitudinous murmurs of the insect life in the grass.</p>
<p>But  suddenly the soft note of a <i>samisen</i> was wafted through one of the wide-open windows, and he drew still closer in  against the leaves&mdash;an involuntary movement which he might not have been able or  willing to analyse. Intuitively he seemed to guess that the hand which struck  the strings was that of an artist, and he leant forward eager in anticipation.</p>
<p>A  sharp, defiant note followed, a coarse twanging of numbers, as though the  player was seized with a sudden fit of anger, and, having nothing else upon  which to vent it, tortured the poor unoffending instrument. Then there was  silence for the space of many moments, and then once more the clear notes  vibrated on the still air. To the uninitiated ear, all Eastern music is nothing  more or less than a bewildering series of discordant sounds; but this  particular listener was not uninitiated, and he distinguished in the notes a  melancholy which, under such conditions, was singularly impressive.</p>
<p>Presently  a voice&mdash;a low-wailing voice&mdash; began to sing with the music; and though Glynton  could catch no word distinctly, he knew that it was the outpouring of a sad and  desolate heart. Like one spell-bound, he stood and listened, breathing hard as  the singer&rsquo;s voice rose in the scale.</p>
<p>Truly  it was a novel experience, one the like of which his wanderings had known no  parallel. Even when the singer&rsquo;s voice had died away, and the strings of the <i>samisen</i> no longer ached and throbbed in  the air, he still stood for some sign or token. Then, with a strange little  cynical laugh, he stepped out from his retreat and made towards the house. Come  what might, he was going to have a peep at this singer of dirges.</p>
<p>As  he approached the house he was greeted by the sharp yelping of a little dog,  which came out on the verandah and presented a furious front. Almost at the  same moment a woman&rsquo;s face appeared at the window, through which had floated  the strains of the guitar. She seemed rather amused at the prodigious anger of  her small dog, and laughingly called to it to desist; and then, with a gracious  smile to the stranger, she apologised most prettily for the rudeness of her  pet.</p>
<p>Glynton  raised his hat and honoured the lady with a profound obeisance; but in the  smiling, round-faced girl before him he failed utterly to recognise the  melancholy singer whose sad song had tuned him to such an extraordinary pitch.  Indeed, he doubted much if this handsome girl, with her reckless, defiant  smile, and her marvellous self-consciousness, could possibly have any  connection with the woman who so lately had poured forth her woes to the sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I fear I am intruding. I saw this pretty spot, and  trudged upward to explore. Then across the sunshine, on a cloud of perfume it  seemed, came the delightful notes of a bird, and I could not retreat without  one glance at the sweet singer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  bowed again, and the girl smiled happily; but at that moment, warned by the  barking of the dog, two men appeared from the back of the house, and the girl&rsquo;s  face as she turned towards them assumed a darker shade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This  stranger is weary and thirsty,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;bring him refreshment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  servants made low obeisance, and then slunk swiftly away to do her bidding. She  watched them disappear, watched with a keen eye, a shaded brow, which, however,  passed from her with the passing of the men. Then she turned once more to the  stranger.</p>
<p>Presently  he was seated in the cool verandah, and, without the slightest trace of  embarrassment, the girl came out and joined him. He looked at her critically,  but found no fault. She was exceedingly handsome, and in her grey <i>kimono</i> looked particularly fresh and  sweet. Her eyes were wonderfully dazzling, and almost bold, he thought; but her  face was, perhaps, a trifle pallid, and sometimes a strange line formed about  the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>Tea  was brought to them in quaint little egg-shell cups, and sweetmeats, too, were  placed upon the table. This was an adventure full of charm. Glynton leant back  and eyed his companion through the thin wreaths of cigarette smoke. </p>
<p>&ldquo;As  I stood among the leaves down yonder I heard a bird,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I not see  her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  laughed. He thought it one of the prettiest mouths that he had ever seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is possible,&rdquo; and she laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  not!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  it was a song full of sadness&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  how know you that I may not be sad at times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  I know not,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but I hope that happiness is ever with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p> She  filled her little silver pipe and lit it, but there was trouble in her eyes as  she stared up at him through the smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she answered slowly, &ldquo;I have the reputation of being good friends with  happiness. It is something, is it not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he said; &ldquo;not if the song I heard came from your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heart!&rdquo;  she echoed, with a disdainful laugh. &ldquo;You do not know me, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  only know that you are beautiful, and that, in spite of your charming face, you  are very sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  she murmured, &ldquo;you see deeper than most people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As  she knocked the ash from her pipe, he rose to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are very kind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I not come again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  hesitated, and looked him keenly up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  live here in Tokio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  a few weeks only. Then I return to Shanghai.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For  good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  I cannot say. It is in the hands of the gods. And you&mdash;do you live here alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  always alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked puzzled, and she smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should one marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  there was unobtrusive evidence of wealth about her and her belongings. The  house, small as it was, was charming; the <i>kimono</i> she wore, though modest in tone and in design, was spun of silk. The obsequious  servants, the boxes of choice flowers, the indefinite and yet general air of  comfort, all proclaimed that this was no ordinary establishment.</p>
<p>Nor  was its owner an ordinary woman, at least so Glynton thought as he walked away,  having stayed longer than common politeness warranted. But she was very  charming, and had given him permission to call again; and all the way home he  saw her handsome face and sparkling eyes, and something behind those eyes which  was as sad as death. Strange woman, strange creature living thus alone: a bird  breaking its heart against the bars of a gilded cage.</p>
<p>When  Hallerton returned that night from Yokohama  he began to apologise profusely for having left his friend; but Glynton cut him  short. He had found something which had entirely compensated him for his friend&rsquo;s  absence.</p>
<p>The  next day, at the selfsame hour, he once more mounted the path which led to the  cottage; but this time she was waiting for him, and as he walked up the little  pathway she appeared at the window, although there was no barking of the dog to  herald his approach. Upon this occasion she was dressed very elaborately, and  her eyes and her cheeks were touched up in the approved native fashion. While  in one way this heightened her beauty, it seemed to rob her of much of her  former charm; and though he felt flattered at her evident desire to please, he  could have wished that she looked not quite so like a <i>geisha</i>. Then he laughed somewhat cynically to himself. Heavens!  what did it matter to him what she looked like?</p>
<p>As  for her, the presence of this stranger seemed infinitely to please. He was  bigger, stronger, more beautiful than any of her own men. His hair was fair,  soft, and silky, and marvellously fascinating; his eyes were so blue that she  was never tired of searching them for the many mysteries which lay in their  depths. Truly, these white people were very lovely! She wondered if he had a  wife, a sweetheart, of his own race. She had heard of the soft, delicate beauty  of the white women. Were they so much more lovely than the Japanese?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  me,&rdquo; she said, as they once more sat in the verandah sipping tea, &ldquo;are the  women of your race so very beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many  of them,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;are very beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  have they hair like yours, and eyes like yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am hideous,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;They have hair like a cluster of sunbeams; to look  into their eyes is to enter the gates of paradise. Their faces are like the red  and white cherry-blossoms yonder; their lips are sweeter than roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  pouted, and something like a frown ran down her forehead to her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  hideous we Japanese must seem beside them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  smiled. It was the piqued daughter of Eve. And so is it all the world over&mdash;  black or white, brown or red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know one Japanese,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who combines in her dainty little person all the  charms of the white woman, and more. And her name&mdash;what think you they call her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  know not,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but I should like to see one who possesses so many  graces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  in your mirror, Kiku,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and then you will see the lady of whom I speak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kiku  blushed very prettily, if not violently, and her eyelids drooped. He noticed  her fingers fumble excitedly with each other as they lay in her lap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  mean it, Kiku,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;You are very lovely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  palpable shudder shook her from head to foot, which he attributed to anything  but the right cause. Yet when he looked into her eyes again, he saw that they  were full of regret, of a pathos which made him pause and think.</p>
<p>When  he reached the bungalow that night his friend Hallerton had already dined, and  had even got through the larger half of his second cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  must apologise, old fellow; but I waited a deuce of a time. Have you dined?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was clearly in the manner of an interrogation, but Glynton was in no  confidential mood. He did not say where he had dined, or with whom. Why should  he?</p>
<p>Hallerton  got up, made his friend a whisky-and-soda, and then handed him the cigar-box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tired?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Glynton; &ldquo;had a long day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  have you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  large order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am sorry, old chap, that I have to leave you so much alone; but you quite understand,  don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow,&rdquo; said Glynton, &ldquo;I beg of you not to mention it if you do not wish  me to feel uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hallerton  laughed good-naturedly. He was an excellent old beggar, this serious eyed  Glynton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By  the way,&rdquo; said Hallerton presently, as he stretched forth to replenish his  glass, &ldquo;I have received an invitation from Count Idzumo. He gives a big  garden-party sort of affair to-morrow afternoon. You will come, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think not, old fellow. Such things are no longer in my line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  must go, of course,&rdquo; said Hallerton. &ldquo;Diplomatic etiquette, you know. What  shall you do with yourself?&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  I shall be all right. Don&rsquo;t bother about me. I suppose Idzumo is a big man now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless  you, yes. A future Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and heaven alone knows  what else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  is very wealthy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very;  and he has a magnificent place. An ugly little black beast&mdash;a native all over;  but one must not show one&rsquo;s dislikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Um!  I don&rsquo;t think his excellency will interest me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  perhaps his <i>geisha</i> may. Kiku is going  to dance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiku!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Glynton  threw off his lethargy and sat upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course, you are a stranger&mdash;you haven&rsquo;t heard of her. She is the chief favourite  of the day. All Tokio has gone mad over her. Commands fabulous prices, they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O&mdash;oh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr.  Glynton was now thoroughly interested in Idzumo&rsquo;s garden party. Kiku&mdash; Kiku!  Over and over again he repeated the name to himself. But of course it could  have no significance. There were thousands of Kikus in Japan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is good, eh?&rdquo; he asked nonchalantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose so&mdash;or at least as good as such performers can be. She was bought out of  her indentures about eighteen months ago by Nadzu, a son of the War Minister,  who only lived six months to regret his rash act. He committed the happy  despatch in a peculiarly horrible manner upon her doorstep. Her servants kicked  the body into the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite  right, too. Dirty fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was inconsiderate. Kiku is not renowned for her sentiment. They say she is very  rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,  of course, she is pretty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, is the East so very different from the West in that respect? Kiku  is very pretty, and she dances excellently&mdash;for a native.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  this Idzumo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, you know as much about it as I do. Gossip says&mdash;but then you know  gossip says many things. I believe it is generally conceded that the Count  takes a fatherly interest in her. He never has an entertainment of any kind of  which she is not the bright particular star.&rdquo; </p>
<p>Later  on, as the two men separated for the night, Glynton said to his friend, &ldquo;I have  changed my mind, Hallerton. I think I shall go and see Kiku dance to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  devoutly hoped that his Kiku might not be the notorious <i>geisha</i> of Tokio whose private history was evidently the theme of so  much gossip. How could she be? There was nothing in her speech or manners  indicative of the degraded professions. She was a woman of sense and sentiment,  and totally unlike the harpy who calls herself a <i>geisha</i>. And yet there was something strange about her, something  that reminded him of days when he first came to Japan with the wild fever of youth  upon him. And then her manner of living was strangest of all, and one, when he  thought of it, well calculated to awaken suspicion.</p>
<p>In  the forenoon of the following day he trudged once more towards her house,  having previously made up his mind to set all doubt at rest. But as he drew  near the verandah a figure appeared in the doorway, and it was not the figure  of Kiku. It was a little dark man who stood before him, an ugly scrap of a  fellow with a ridiculously thin moustache and beard, narrow black slits of eyes  set close to the nose, and a retreating forehead of some considerable  dimensions.</p>
<p>Glynton  did not remember seeing the man before, but having no doubt that he was a  servant, he merely nodded familiarly and asked if the honourable mistress of  the house was within. The little man replied slowly with a shake of the head.  Then it was that Glynton, more closely scrutinising, saw that in his informant  which he had previously failed to notice. The man, though obviously most  carelessly attired, carried himself quite unlike a servant; and Glynton, when  he set his wits to work, recognised this in an instant. Then who was he, and  what was he doing in Kiku&rsquo;s house?</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  has been gone long?&rdquo; asked Glynton, a shade of greater deference in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe so, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  Englishman duly noted the peculiar tone in which the word &ldquo;excellency&rdquo; was expressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  will return soon&mdash;perhaps?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,  excellency; but I think not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because  to-night she dances for the great Count Idzumo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should I not, excellency? Is not Kiku the loveliest and most illustrious <i>geisha</i> in all Japan, and is not the honourable  Count one of her most successful patrons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  self-complacent smile, which excessively irritated Glynton, played about the  man&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  take great liberties with the reputation of your mistress,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gossip,  my worthy fellow, is not wise in a servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  excellency. I will think of it. And your excellency&rsquo;s business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  with your mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  who shall I say has called?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe  me. She will know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  the man&rsquo;s face was a perfect study, and though at the best of times Glynton was  not a particularly keen observer, he did not fail to notice the singular  expression which played about the little Jap&rsquo;s beady eyes.</p>
<p>He  flung the fellow half a <i>yen</i>, and  turned on his heel. He was angry and he was disappointed, and, in spite of a  prodigious effort to laugh, he felt a creeping sickness about the heart which  caused him intense annoyance. Something suggested love, but he laughed loudly,  and perhaps a trifle idiotically at the mere idea. Lord! how he had been  fooled! The sweet singer, the mournful maiden with whom he had sympathised, who  lived alone without love, without happiness, was the most notorious woman in  all Tokio.</p>
<p>It  was with a disgusted and desperate feeling that he went with his friend to the  reception. A dozen times during his journey homewards he had hesitated to take  the step, but as often his weakness to see her overcame his pride. It would be  something to be able to laugh at his own folly.</p>
<p>It  was late when he and Hallerton arrived, but they immediately went in search of  the Count, and presently beheld him coming towards them in close conversation  with the French Minister. Hallerton advanced, a glib apology on his tongue, but  Glynton followed in no easy mood. The little gentleman who was so deeply  engaged in conversation with the Frenchman was the illustrious Count Idzumo&mdash;the  person whom Glynton had seen at Kiku&rsquo;s house that morning.</p>
<p>The  Count smiled meaningly as Hallerton introduced his friend, and immediately his  hand went to his waistcoat pocket. But withdrawing it instantly, he said, with  a smile, &ldquo;No; I will keep it as a souvenir.&rdquo; Which cryptic utterance filled  Hallerton&rsquo;s face with bewilderment.</p>
<p>When  they were once more alone, he said to Glynton, &ldquo;What did the Count mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  replied his friend, with an inscrutable smile, &ldquo;the Count and I have met before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  devil!&rdquo; muttered the diplomat.</p>
<p>Glynton  was like a man pulled two different ways. He was eager, anxious to see Kiku  dance; and yet, with all his soul he loathed the thought of it. Nevertheless,  he followed the crowd into the great room which had been transformed into a  temporary theatre, and patiently awaited her turn; and when at length she came  on and began to cut capers and grimace, a veritable painted <i>geisha</i>, his chin dropped forward and he  could not look; but through an atmosphere of theatric affectation, through-the  sounding of the drum and the tinkling of the <i>samisen</i>, he heard a dirge-like wail, and saw the white, sad face of  a woman.</p>
<p>When  he looked up again, Kiku was making her exit to tumultuous applause. Men made  strange jokes and laughed strange laughs. The atmosphere stifled him; he made  his apologies and withdrew.</p>
<p>That  night she was to dance again, but when, an hour or so after, Glynton and Hallerton  met, the diplomat informed his friend that the pet <i>geisha</i> had suddenly been taken ill, and would appear no more that  day. But plenty of entertainment was promised. Idzumo knew how to do the thing  well. There were rumours of a magnificent exposition of the <i>kina</i>. It had been hoped that Kiku would  lead. . . .</p>
<p>Glynton  heard no more, but that night found him not among the Count&rsquo;s guests. Angry  with himself, and yet impelled onward by a force which he would have been  powerless to analyse, even had he striven, he had wended his way to the little  house on the hill, and with a shamed, hesitating manner, she came down the path  to meet him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  told me you were ill,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and so I came to see.&rdquo; She did not tell him  that her illness was brought on by a glimpse of him with shame and confusion  writ large upon his face. &ldquo;I did not know you were a <i>geisha</i>.&rdquo; She bowed her head without answering. &ldquo;Idzumo&rsquo;s <i>geisha</i>,&rdquo; he added, meaningly. </p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  my lord,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;not that! Idznmo, he is rich and great, but I hate him.  Let my lord say the word and Idzumo employs me no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why  should I? What is it to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  what is it to my lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiku,  they tell strange tales of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is so, my lord. I know. <i>Kitsune-tsuki</i>&mdash;fox-woman&mdash;witch&mdash;I  have heard them repeated. But those who do not know me tell the strangest tales  of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  story of Nadzu, the War Minister&rsquo;s son, leapt to his lips. But the bowed figure  and the penitent face were an irresistible appeal to silence. And, after all,  what was it to him?</p>
<p>Her  little hand slipped tremblingly into his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  we love, my lord, is it not enough?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  say the love of the <i>kitsune-tsuki</i> is  death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  my lord does not believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;And Idzumo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  lord&rsquo;s eyes have blinded me,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>His  arms slipped round her shoulders, and she nestled closely to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiku,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I think they are right. You are a witch.&rdquo; </p>

<p>Floyd&rsquo;s  uncle being an official of some importance at the Legation in Tokio, it not  unnaturally followed that when the nephew paid his never-to-be-forgotten visit  he saw the imperial city at its best. Like many well-to-do young fellows, he  had, on finishing his education, set out to circumnavigate the globe; and his  wanderings having led him to the Far East, he paused there a little while&mdash;and  was sobered ever after.</p>
<p>No  one, of course, blamed him. In the East, as in the West, no one ever blames the  man&mdash;that is, no one of any distinction. A few narrow-minded Pharisees may rail,  creatures of no birth or breeding; but your gentleman is above any such puerile  sentiment. It is always the woman who suffers, the woman who pays. Yet the  sufferings of Omi-San, she whom the great Count Tora condescended to honour,  made the most thoughtless pause and think.</p>
<p>Floyd  was young, good-looking, well set up&mdash;one in whom was personified the glory of  life. The whole wide world lay before him, and into it he leapt with the mad  impetuosity of youth. There is no joy like that of living, of squeezing the  last drop of pleasure out of life. The young may grow reckless without losing  their charm. There is a world between the follies of youth and the sins of age.</p>
<p>As  I have already said, his connection with the aforesaid high official gave him a  decided advantage over the wandering tourist, or the ordinary inhabitant of a  treaty port; and it was through this diplomatic connection that he first came  in contact with Omi of the Yellow Kimono. Not that the diplomat was directly  responsible. It was written, that is all. And what is written neither diplomat  nor emperor can blot out. Only things turn out very strangely at times, and we  who have the power to think and learn are gifted with many riches.</p>
<p>Count  Tora, when free of the exigencies of his office about the court, spent his days  on the very beautiful estate which he owned on the shores of the Bay of Yedo,  and thither Floyd went with his uncle to pass a couple of days. The Count knew  very little English, and Floyd absolutely no Japanese; but the uncle was  thoroughly conversant with the native tongue, and the young man found amusement  enough in the novelty of his surroundings.</p>
<p>By  some judicious questioning he quickly realised that the reputation of his host  did not ill agree with his appearance, and though that reputation was no  concern of his, it enabled him to contemplate somewhat leniently his own folly.  For Tora was neither pleasant in manners nor in appearance. Short of stature,  and broad beyond all proportion, he wore a heavy, ugly mask of a face out of  which peered two little slits of black fire. He owned a starved beard and  moustache (the yellow men cannot grow much hair on the face), of which he was  believed to be inordinately fond. For the rest, his nose was broad and flat,  his mouth not ill-formed, but heavy. The sophisticated would say, upon looking  at him, that he was fond of good things, and that he could be cruel when angry.</p>
<p>But  what did all this matter? He was Count Tora, one upon whom the Emperor deigned  to cast his illustrious eyes. What other honour is there for man to achieve?  And even if that was not enough, which is highly incredible, Count Tora had  many of this world&rsquo;s riches, and in his own way he was still the <i>daimio</i>, the feudal chief.</p>
<p>Floyd  and his uncle arrived in time for the midday meal, after which they spent a  couple of hours in viewing the extensive grounds of the Count; but after that  the young man felt the time begin to drag. He could not sit still, drink tea,  and listen to a language he did not understand. So, under the pretence of  smoking a cigar, he went out into the grounds, the beauty of which compensated  him somewhat for the unintelligible chatter within.</p>
<p>Wandering  aimlessly about, he suddenly found himself facing a bank of roses&mdash; roses red,  and pink, and white, the perfume of which was wafted like a cloud through the  sunshine. He stopped for a moment to inhale the delicious fragrance; and as he  drew in the sweet air with long, deep breaths, it suddenly struck him that Tora  had not shown them this bank, certainly one of the most charming spots of his  garden. But there were so many charming spots. Tora was embarrassed with  riches.</p>
<p>He  walked on slowly, feasting his eyes with the brilliant masses of colour, his  senses with the sweet air, and presently he espied a light gate of trellis-work  let into the hedge. This evidently led into an inner garden, one which he felt  sure they had not explored with Tora. Why?</p>
<p>He  pushed back the gate and entered, and as he did so he caught the flutter of a  yellow dress in the distance. It was in the far corner of the garden, down by  the bank of roses. The owner thereof might even have been watching him through  the blooms.</p>
<p>Without  stopping to think, he made direct for the clump of shrubbery behind which he  had seen the yellow <i>kimono</i> disappear;  but when he arrived there, he just caught a glimpse of it vanishing behind  another clump further down the garden. Redoubling his speed, for the glimpse he  had caught of the flying figure, coupled with its evident desire to avoid him,  had whetted his curiosity, he soon overtook it and brought it to bay in a  corner of the garden.</p>
<p>He  felt rather ashamed of himself as he saw her distress. His conduct was not in  conformity with good taste or good manners; but he was in the East, where the  white man is usually a law unto himself. What the native thinks of him is a  matter of no concern. Who thinks anything of a native?</p>
<p>A  closer scrutiny revealed many charms in the wearer of the yellow <i>kimono</i>, not the least of which were the  pretty blushes which chased each other across her troubled face. He looked, and  saw that she was embarrassed, but her embarrassment lent her such a fascination  that he would willingly have committed a more serious crime for a like result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Ohayo!</i>&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>It  was one of the few words of Japanese which comprised his limited vocabulary,  and the pronunciation, or mispronunciation, of it afforded him a moment of  pleasure. It was equivalent to our greeting, &ldquo;Good day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then  slowly she raised her head, and in a low voice stammered, &ldquo;<i>Ohayo!</i>&rdquo; Floyd knew not why it should be so, but he felt his pulses  leap as the soft word rang through his brain. He hurriedly mispronounced a few  more words, and then came to a sudden standstill. After all, upon occasion, it  is just as well to know even Japanese.</p>
<p>But  if the tongue is not always understood, it can invariably make itself fairly  intelligible with the aid of the eyes; and in her wondering way Omi-San thought  the full grey eyes of the stranger something more than human. Never had she  looked into such eyes, except in her dreams, and then she confused them with  the clouds and the sky, and the white spirits which haunted the snow regions of  the North. And they were now looking into hers, burning, unfathomable, and in a  vague way she seemed to realise that a new influence was taking possession of  her heart and her soul.</p>
<p>In  the meantime, his brain had not been slow to grasp certain possibilities. With  the eyes of a connoisseur, he had been quietly absorbing each and every  particular of the quaint, winsome creature before him&mdash;from the butterfly  pattern of her hair to the rich yellow <i>kimono</i> with its red flowers and leaves of embroidered silk. She was, perhaps, taller  than the average native woman, and her head was set on a neck which would have  delighted the soul of a Japanese artist. Her mouth was soft and lovable, and,  so Floyd thought, made for kisses. And yet it was more than probable that she  knew nothing of that Western delight. Heavens! but he would like to teach  her&mdash;and might, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>He  took her hand, and she let him hold it without demur. He paid her extravagant  compliments, in his own language, of course. Did she know what he meant? Well,  woman is woman. Place a man in juxtaposition to her, give him a pair of eyes.  He wants nothing else&mdash;nor she either.</p>
<p>In  this rose-scented garden the minutes flew upon the wings of the lightning. The  air was full of sunshine and sweetness, and the drowsy hum of the small life in  the grass. But the rose bank against which they sat began to throw a long  shadow upon the ground, though neither seemed to notice it. Then of a sudden  the sound of a human voice disturbed the tranquillity of the scene. It was Tora  speaking on the other side of the hedge. Floyd awoke and looked into the face  of Omi-San.</p>
<p>It  had suddenly gone white with terror. Her eyes were full of fear; she breathed  quickly, shortly, with great difficulty. He formed his mouth as though to  speak, but hurriedly she covered it with her hand. That he was surprised, the  expression of his eyes denoted; nevertheless, he had sufficient presence of  mind to kiss the little pink pahn.</p>
<p>A  moment she sat, head erect, eyes and ears alert, and presently the voice came  again, this time in the distance. Then she rose to her feet, seized Floyd by  the hand, and with a scared look hurried him towards the trellis-gate through  which he had entered. Then with an excited gesticulation she bade him begone.  But knowing nothing of her danger he had none of her fear; so that when she  turned to go he sprang after her, caught her in his arms, and held her face up  to his; and though she struggled, it was only in a weak, womanish way. He made  her eyes meet his. Then he kissed her. He knew Omi-San would not forget.</p>
<p>Without  being observed, he made his way from the garden, and in a distant part of the  grounds discovered Tora and his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  have you been?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been looking for you everywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  we for you,&rdquo; said his host.</p>
<p>He  bore without flinching the scrutiny with which the illustrious Tora honoured  him. And yet he wondered why he should feel so antagonistic towards the Count&mdash;why  his back should stiffen because the august little slit-eye took upon himself  the liberty to look.</p>
<p>But  that night, as his uncle and he smoked together before retiring, he suddenly  evinced an uncommon interest in the native language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  listened hard to you and the Count talking,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It seemed to me a very  pretty tongue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was a feeble, boyish excuse, and quite unnecessary. But Floyd was young at  deception, and he showed the raw hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe  me,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;some excellent compliments may be paid even in Japanese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should like to learn a few.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  uncle favoured him with a quizzing smile. After all, it was natural enough; and  the little creatures had a charm of their own which especially appealed to the  new-comer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have found the language rather a difficulty, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear uncle, a man should know how to pay a compliment to a lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have no fault to find with the desire to acquire knowledge; the danger lies in  the uses to which knowledge is put. For instance, I should not advise you to  try your &rsquo;prentice hand on any lady whom the illustrious Tora delights to  honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  young gentleman protested with a stern shake of the head. This imputation of  poaching evidently did him a great injustice. The uncle marked, and smiled.  Though a diplomat, and one well versed in the wily ways of the East and West,  he still had a sneaking fondness for the scruples of youth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  merely mention it&mdash;in parenthesis. Our esteemed host, in spite of his smattering  of our language, and a thin coating of veneer, is still the Oriental, and that  means anything and everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has  he many women?&rdquo; inquired the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear boy, he is an Oriental.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  a deuced ugly little specimen too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There  was, perhaps, more bitterness in the words than the occasion warranted.  Ugliness in a Jap did not strike the diplomat as being at all singular. Indeed,  he could not conceive any one making such an entirely superfluous remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course he&rsquo;s ugly, and if rumour be true, he can at times act in conformity with  his distressing physiognomy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am not surprised. He looks a little devil. Always reminds me of one of those  hideous masks which the native artists delight in carving. He must have been  born after a nightmare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  believe he was,&rdquo; said the diplomat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  Floyd&rsquo;s mistrust of Tora did not lessen his interest in that nobleman&rsquo;s  language. He had discovered that, although English is almost universal, it is  not quite so, and until the happy epoch arrives when it will be, it might not  be disadvantageous to know a few words of some of the barbarous languages which  are still in existence. So he prevailed upon his uncle to write out a dozen or  two of the commonest phrases or expressions, which, coupled with another two or  three dozen words, completed a very handy vocabulary. But the words that seemed  to interest him most were those intimately connected with what old-fashioned  folk used to call the &ldquo;tender passion,&rdquo; and half-a-dozen other pretty but  wholly inadequate names. And the uncle, thoroughly enjoying this display of  youthful ingenuousness, the like of which did not often illumine the dreary  desert of political guile, entered into his work with an assiduity beyond all  praise.</p>
<p>At  parting that night Floyd carefully folded the papers on which the precious  words were written, and deposited them deep down in his pocket-book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall look over them in the morning,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think I shall find them very  useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  elder man smiled. It was well for old fogies that their youth should be  reviewed from time to time.</p>
<p>Three  hours later the young man was still heroically striving to grapple with a  sleepy brain; but in this instance nature was stronger than will, though even  that could not wholly subdue the spirit. In his dreams he paid sweet  compliments in Japanese to the blushing Omi-San.</p>
<p>The  next morning he was up early and about; but though he haunted the precincts of  the rose garden, he caught but one glimpse of Omi-San in the distance, or  rather, he caught a glimpse of a yellow <i>kimono</i> which looked like hers. Whether she saw him or not he could not say, but when  he had reached the big clump of rhododendrons behind which she had vanished,  she was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Not  a little angry with himself, he retraced his steps, and doubt as to the wisdom  or propriety of the course he had adopted assailed him. What if she was one of  the women of whom his uncle had spoken? This made him pause&mdash;gave him time to  catch his breath. Well, and even so&mdash;what then? It was not an entirely  satisfactory answer that he gave himself. The problem had merely been guessed  at, not solved. After all, why should he attempt to solve it? Things have a way  of righting themselves&mdash;sometimes. Sometimes they don&rsquo;t. Well, it is not for youth  to waste its glory in wondering what might be. Regret must come with the years,  and wisdom brings not happiness. Eat, drink, and be merry&mdash;was there ever a  wiser philosophy?</p>
<p>There  is something desperately splendid in youth, for whom the words &ldquo;fear&rdquo; and  &ldquo;failure&rdquo; do not exist, to whom death itself is a grotesque and jocular  monster. Floyd was not one lightly to abandon an idea, especially one which had  seized him with a grip which was almost a challenge. Tora, nor fifty Toras,  should not thwart him. As for the woman&mdash;well, a woman&rsquo;s resource is practically  unlimited. And things have a way of righting themselves, you know.</p>
<p>That  afternoon, as before, he went out into the grounds to smoke a cigar, leaving his  uncle and the illustrious Tora deeply engrossed in a game of <i>shogi</i>, or Japanese chess. As both were  good players, and as the game was progressing at a snail&rsquo;s pace, he thanked  heaven for the bewildering complications of the board. It would give him  breathing space.</p>
<p>With  but a slight pretence of deviation, he went towards the rose garden, passed  through the trellis-gate, and then paused. Looking at his watch, he saw that it  was within a few minutes of the hour in which he first saw her, and in a vague  sort of way he mused. Would she be there? Why should she be? His modesty would  not permit him to answer the question. Or, since he was there, why should he  not ask, Why should she not be? Yet there were many reasons. To him it was  likely to prove rather an interesting adventure. The reckless spirit of youth  urged him to see it through&mdash;just for the fun of the thing. But, if some of his  imaginings were to be realised, it would be anything but fun for her.</p>
<p>He  looked rather guiltily past the sun&rsquo;s shoulder and slowly walked on, and  presently, in a little bower of roses, he caught a glimpse of the yellow <i>kimono</i>. Stealthily he approached and  peered through the leaves, and he felt his nerves thrill in a strangely  unaccountable fashion.</p>
<p>She  was sitting, cross-legged, upon the grass; over her knees lay a long, printed  scroll, which had evidently failed in interest. Her eyes were, apparently,  fixed on a certain tree, the branches of which towered highest in the sky; but  the watcher doubted if she saw the tree at all; he doubted if she saw anything  but some vague picture of the brain. Not a movement saw he of eyelid or of  limb&mdash;the rise and fall of her bosom was almost imperceptible. A quaintly  costumed doll she seemed, vaguely suspicious of life.</p>
<p>He  drew closer, and yet she stirred not. Her dream was most profound, and not, if  he might judge from a certain ineffable sadness which, like a shadow, played  about her eyes, tinged with the rosiest of hues. A momentary throb of  compunction made him pause. Then he flung his head back and stood before her.</p>
<p>At  the sight of him she started, blushed, and began to tremble violently; but he  knelt beside her and took her hand in his, and in a broken, stumbling manner,  without sense or sequence, he repeated over and over again the pretty words and  phrases his uncle had written down for him the night before. And from the eyes  of Omi-San he drove the shadow of melancholy, and her bosom, rising and falling  rapidly, throbbed with the new life which had so suddenly filled it to overflowing.  And the sunshine flooded the roses with a deeper gold, and the sweet-scented  air whispered a thousand bewildering secrets in her ears.</p>
<p>The  visit to Tora ended all too quickly, but Floyd had no intention of letting the  acquaintanceship lapse for lack of intercourse. The Count&rsquo;s estate was only  some seven or eight miles from the capital. A couple of rickshaw coolies could  easily do the distance in an hour. When Floyd thought he wanted some fresh air,  he usually found himself bowling along the road that led to Tora&rsquo;s house, and  if the illustrious owner did not happen to be in&mdash;well, it was a great  misfortune, but he would call again soon. And it was really remarkable how many  times he did happen to call while the Count was away, and though, on such  occasions, he appeared profoundly distressed, he usually solaced himself with a  turn in the beautiful grounds.</p>
<p>These  constant visits of the Englishman at length gave the honourable Tora some food  for reflection. He learnt something of the story of the rose garden, and that  morning his household knew that he was to set out at midday for Osaka.</p>
<p>That  night Omi-San waited impatiently for the coming of her lover. She was  restless&mdash;ill at ease. Excitedly she paced up and down her room; occasionally  she went to the window, and, drawing it back an inch or so, peered out. But at  last came the tap on the shutter, the low call, &ldquo;Omi-San,&rdquo; and she was in his  arms. Then there was a sudden commotion round about, lights flashed in the  room, and her lord and master, Tora, stood before her, his ugly face livid with  rage, his limbs trembling with excitement.</p>
<p>Without  speaking, he turned and beckoned to the two servants who held the lights, and  they immediately advanced towards Omi-San. She saw the movement, her face  blanched with terror, and, recoiling before them, she flung herself at Floyd&rsquo;s  feet, and in a voice that rang with acutest fear she implored his protection.</p>
<p>Now,  whatever virtues he may have lacked, courage was not one of them. He was quick  to perceive that he had got himself in a tight corner, and just as quick to  act. He had only his hands to aid him, but in a trice they went up, and  presently one of them shot out like a streak of lightning, and the man nearest  him staggered heavily backward, the candle, meteor-like, flashing through the  firmament of the chamber. Omi-San, doubled in a heap upon the floor, buried her  face in her hands and moaned aloud.</p>
<p>Tora&rsquo;s  hand flew to his pocket, but he as suddenly withdrew it. Then he went and  opened the door through which Floyd had entered, and, turning to him, said the  one word&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked at the Count, and across his face flickered the shades of obstinacy and  irresolution. He knew not what to do; yet wisdom would not be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count  Tora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I apologise freely for my presence here to-night. I frankly  admit that I am entirely in the wrong, and I am perfectly willing to assume the  consequences. For what has happened I, and I only, am to blame. This woman was  a child in my hands. I assume responsibility for her also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  honourable generosity shall not be put to the test,&rdquo; sneered the Count. &ldquo;I have  no need of you or your illustrious virtues.&rdquo; Then, once more, he pointed  sternly to the door.</p>
<p>Floyd  flushed hotly; his eyes shone with fury and dogged impotence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will not go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;until you have forgiven her also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have not forgiven you yet,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Go, before I forget who and what you  are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go,  go!&rdquo; Wailed the unhappy woman. &ldquo;O my lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  plaintive cry went to his heart and stirred every manly impulse. She was all  the world to him at that moment. He sprang forward with arms outstretched, but  the servants barred his way. He looked into their grim, impassive faces. These  men were machines guided by the voice of the master yonder.</p>
<p>Recognising  the hopelessness of his position, he turned once more to Tora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let  us talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The folly and the blame are mine. I want you to remember  that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall not forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  anything I can do&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  can do nothing. I am weary. To-morrow we will talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,  be it. Until then you will forget?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  will forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked about the room, at the faces of Tora and his servants, at the thin  partitions behind which many more might eagerly be awaiting the signal. Then  his eyes rested for a moment on the crouching, moaning figure of the woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell,  Omi-San,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I will come again to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow!  O my lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All  through the long run back to the city her voice haunted him; he heard it above  the rattle of his rickshaw; it palpitated in the air like the wailing of a lost  soul. &ldquo;To-morrow! O my lord!&rdquo; Early the next day he presented himself at the  gates of Tora&rsquo;s estate, and was there handed a letter by an obsequious  retainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  is this!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had  not your excellency better read it and see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With  nervous fingers he tore open the envelope, and these words, written in English,  met his gaze&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Count  Tora is sorry to deprive himself of the honour of once more basking in the  illustrious presence of Mr. Floyd, but the promised interview is quite  unnecessary now, as Omi-San died <i>suddenly</i> last night.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="Singapura"></a>Singapura</b></h2>
<p>Captain  Michael Barryton, the master of the S.S. <i>Samarang</i>,  was a lank, easy-going Irishman with a ruddy face, a shock of red hair, and a  decided penchant for his great compatriot, John Jameson. When he engaged me at  the shipping-office he was drunk; he was anything but sober the day he received  me on board his noble packet, and on the afternoon we put to sea he was  drunkest of all. But a too liberal indulgence of strong spirits mattered little  or nothing to him, for drunk or sober his navigation was equally faulty. That  also was a mere detail, though it surprised many to see how successfully his  incompetence waged war with fate. For he was one of that small army to whom is  entrusted valuable property and valueless lives. </p>
<p>Robinson  meets Brown in the street and says, &ldquo;Ah, I see the <i>Samarang</i> is back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear  me,&rdquo; cries Brown, to whom the good luck of Barryton is a source of wonder and  distress; &ldquo;when <i>is</i> that old tub going  to the bottom!&rdquo; They know she will go down some day and take her worthy master  with her. But the delay is, to say the least of it, somewhat exasperating.</p>
<p>I  frankly admit that Captain Barryton did not impress me; I am also at liberty to  express the belief that he never tried to do so. I knew that some exceedingly  queer fish infest the China Seas, and in that respect my new skipper was not so  distinctly unique as he might be; but hitherto it had not been my good fortune  to sail with them, and if I did not duly admire the man, I can only apologise  for my lack of enthusiasm by the novelty of my surroundings. There was  undoubtedly a breeziness about him which, to the uninitiated, was so like a  sailor; though I fear he caught it from his particular brand, and not from the  ocean breezes. Still, that was of little moment: the effect was there. His  friends said he was a &ldquo;good sort,&rdquo; and, in admitting so much, had no idea they  were taking away his character.</p>
<p>When  I joined the <i>Samarang</i> as chief mate,  she was about to proceed to Nagasaki for coal; for she was what is known in sea  parlance as a &ldquo;tramp,&rdquo; and went wherever she was likely to pick up a cargo.  After my arrival on board I naturally seized the earliest opportunity of making  myself acquainted with a few facts concerning the ship, and the particular  idiosyncrasies of my shipmates. And in this I was singularly fortunate, as from  the chief engineer, a worthy but garrulous North-countryman, I learnt much that  I required&mdash;and something more.</p>
<p>According  to the man of cranks and wheels, Captain Barryton was an exceedingly good sort  of fellow, and was extremely affable for one in such an exalted position.  Indeed, upon occasion, he had been known to drink even with the engineers. This  marks the extreme limit of the boundaries of condescension, and I duly  appreciated such heroic magnanimity. It is, perhaps, unnecessary to say that  the captain was not overburdened with sense or sentiment; but still he was a  man who might have risen in the world had he not taken to whisky&mdash;and a wife.</p>
<p>Not  unnaturally, this vague suggestion led me to suppose that things were not  exactly ship-shape with Mrs. Barryton; and when I very delicately hinted as  much, the engineer favoured me with a look ambiguously wise. For it meant many  things, proving a source of infinite speculation. Yet the implied  colloquialism, &ldquo;What do you think!&rdquo; was painfully evident.</p>
<p>I  felt my way with a nicety beyond all praise; but, having gone so far, the  fellow grew alert, even suspicious, and I laboured under the disadvantage of  being practically an unknown quantity. But I oiled his bearings in the most  artful manner, and presently they began to run smoothly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  you know who she is!&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  should I? I never heard of Captain Barryton until I joined the <i>Samarang</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  you&rsquo;ve heard of <i>her?</i>&rdquo; The engineer  put the question with a due appreciation of its value.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked me blankly in the face. Never heard of her? Was it possible? I could see  that he was sorry for me in my benighted state, but out of regard for my  feelings he did not openly express his pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you don&rsquo;t know <i>what</i> she is?&rdquo; he asked  incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  she is?&rdquo; Upon my soul I neither knew nor cared. What should or could she be?</p>
<p>He  looked up and down the deck before answering. Then, sinking his voice to a  whisper, he said, &ldquo;We call her Singapura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  look of infinite pity swept his ill-shaped face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo;  he echoed, &ldquo;because she&rsquo;s a Malay, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  saw the connection in a moment. Singapura, or Sinhapura, which is, perhaps,  more correct, is the native word for Singapore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So  madam is a native, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes;  don&rsquo;t you think it&rsquo;s rather rum?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t fancy it myself. But has he really married her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  has. We had our doubts at first&mdash; but it&rsquo;s gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  good luck to him. He&rsquo;s a bold man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,  she&rsquo;s handsome enough for him, or for anybody,&rdquo; he answered sturdily; &ldquo;but the  devil&rsquo;s in her&mdash;in her eyes, in every movement of her heavenly figure. I&rsquo;ll tell  you what it is,&rdquo; he added impressively, &ldquo;she can just twist the old man round  her dainty little finger.&rdquo; </p>
<p>I  thought the engineer envied the captain that exquisite species of torture; but  I said rather bluntly, &ldquo;Rather a comedown, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,  well, poor man,&rdquo; said he consolingly, &ldquo;he finds a power of comfort in the  bottle. And she&rsquo;s a spanker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  enthusiasm caused me to look closer, and I saw that which the engineer had no  intention of showing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is with him, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  always travels with us, but she never stays on board while we are in port. At  the present time she is putting up at the Hong-Kong Hotel. Trust the missis for  doing the thing in style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  Malay woman,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  a spanker, and as handsome as paint, and don&rsquo;t you forget it,&rdquo; he replied, with  what I considered to be an unnecessary display of warmth. I looked again and  was sorry for him, for I guessed that he had failed to realise his hopes. Yet  in an instant, how he was up in arms! No doubt he aspired highly, but luck  might change. After all, she might possess that singular feminine  characteristic which revels in the hideous. If so, there was hope for the  engineer.</p>
<p>Though  caring little one way or the other, I nevertheless often found myself thinking  of Singapura; and as our day of sailing drew near, and the fellows began to  talk about her, I experienced a mild sort of excitement in anticipating her  advent. And yet her coming was nothing to me, and as I handed her up the  gangway, I experienced none of that inward throbbing which seemed almost to lay  the engineer prostrate. She appeared to be a fine figure of a woman, and her  complexion was such that at the distance of a dozen paces she might easily have  passed for a European. Her dress was singularly neat and effective, and her  terai hat became her as it becomes few women. Had I not been warned, I should  never have guessed her nationality.</p>
<p>My  disappointment was curiously acute. I freely admit that I had expected  something very different. What? Who shall say? At the same time, I thought the  engineer was a fool, and that the fool had fooled me. She smiled and said  &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; very prettily as I led her on to the deck, and I saw her teeth  gleam and her eyes shine. Lustrous eyes, dark as night with the fire of stars  in them.</p>
<p>Soon  after we cleared the Ly-ee-moon   Pass, and were steaming  northward at the rate of nine knots an hour. The captain, who had bidden a  convivial goodbye to his numerous friends on shore, then set the course and  went below. Drunk or sober mattered nothing to him. He could have felt his way  along the coast blindfolded.</p>
<p>I  did not have the honour of seeing or speaking to his wife any more that day;  but the next morning she was up early and about, and after hanging round the  quarterdeck for a time, she came forward and mounted the bridge. I raised my  cap and said &ldquo;Good morning&rdquo; in my very best manner, for you must remember that  a handsome woman is a handsome woman, be she Malay or white, and when she  attains the dignity of a captain&rsquo;s wife, she is not to be dumped in the  category of lesser mortals. She honoured me with an exceedingly pretty  inclination of the head and a quick look from her wonderful eyes, and having  received as much attention as I merited, I turned and continued to keep a  remarkably sharp look-out. Nevertheless, I thought she carried her head well,  and that she had a gloriously free step. The engineer was not far wrong when he  said she was as handsome as paint. It was a homely figure, but it expressed his  admiration in full, and conveyed to his mind an image entirely beautiful. And  though without much difficulty I might find a more elegant phrase, I doubt if  it would better express the impression left upon one by her ladyship. She was  as handsome as paint. </p>
<p>And  yet, singular as it may seem, I still marvelled at the skipper marrying her.  For, beauty as she was, she was only a native beauty, and men in the East don&rsquo;t  usually honour such. It may be wrong. I hold a brief for neither side; but I  have my own opinion. Contact with the whites may enable her to ape their  manners; but a thousand layers of veneer cannot change the blood. There is a  gulf between the white and the coloured which no philosophy can bridge.</p>
<p>Eager  as was my lookout, I kept it with my eyes only. The brain which should have  guided those eyes and told them what they saw communicated no information; for  it was busy with the woman whose presence I felt, and whom I knew was watching  me. But I persevered with a persistence worthy of the utmost admiration, and,  even when I walked to her end of the bridge, I did so in a manner of much  unconcern. Truth to tell, I was not a little annoyed. I felt that I was a fool,  and was angry in consequence. Against my will this woman was asserting her  influence, and I knew not how much vanity was responsible for the state of my  nerves, and I felt contemptible accordingly. What the deuce had Hecuba to do  with me, or I with Hecuba?</p>
<p>Presently,  thinking, no doubt, that I would not presume to address a lady of her exalted  rank, she came over to me and began to talk. A junk about a quarter of a mile  ahead, which seemed determined to make us run it down, afforded the opening.  She laughed excitedly as we skimmed by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  warning,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>She  shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Chinese never take warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  wondered how many people do, and quietly expressed the thought. She laughed  again, showing her beautiful little teeth. I had a potent warning before me at  the moment, only I didn&rsquo;t know it. Then, the ice once broken, we chatted away  with a right good will. Though she spoke with a curious, hollow accent, her  English was excellent, and interesting.</p>
<p>As  she was, comparatively speaking, a child of Nature, she did not suffer from the  reproach of being excessively ladylike&mdash;a term which not infrequently carries  with it a suggestion the reverse of complimentary; but as these Eastern peoples  are rarely vulgar, she gained somewhat by the loss of such a distinction.  However, she was good enough to bombard me with a host of pertinent questions,  evincing a curiosity concerning my antecedents which I naturally regarded as  extremely flattering.</p>
<p>In  the clear light of the early day she did not seem quite as handsome as I had  thought her. Her complexion had been stained by Nature to an interesting brown  which did not altogether appeal to me, though the skin itself was so clear that  I seemed to see the red blood leaping underneath. The black brows sharply  accentuated the whiter skin of her forehead, while her eyelids seemed weary of  bearing the long, silken lashes. The eyes themselves were full, but so  intensely black that I appeared to look straight into illuminated night. The  nose was good, the mouth full-lipped and perhaps a trifle large. Certes! When I  come to catalogue her charms, I find the engineer was not so much beside the  mark.</p>
<p>After  that she paid me many a visit during my watch, sometimes at an hour which,  prudent man as I was, caused me considerable anxiety. But she made light of my  fears, and I was always too weak to treat a lady harshly. Barryton was asleep;  no one saw but the man at the wheel, and he apparently saw nothing. And it was  really marvellous how swiftly the time passed while she was on the bridge; and  life was not so gay aboard of us that I dared turn my back on a little  relaxation.</p>
<p>Well,  the old <i>Samarang</i> plodded steadily on  until at last we dropped anchor in the Bay of Nagasaki.  Then the captain pulled himself together and prepared to conduct his business  like a man of affairs; and as he was shrewd enough when sober, he probably  found little difficulty in imposing upon strangers. But for the first time in  the recollection of the chief engineer, Singapura lived on the ship in port.  And this was doubly strange, as the loading of coal makes a ship perfectly uninhabitable.  True, she went ashore every day at about eleven o&rsquo;clock, but she always  returned at sunset, and never left again that night.</p>
<p>But  if the other officers were surprised at this, I cannot with a free conscience  say that to me it was a very great mystery. And yet, having no wish to write  myself down a coxcomb, I dare not say what was passing in my mind. One may  easily produce a wrong impression, and I am not heroic enough to defy wrong  impressions. But I was not utterly devoid of all power of observation, though  some people seem to think that a hero should be.</p>
<p>I  saw much of her during those quiet nights. After the heat and bustle of the day,  tired out in body and mind, it was pleasant to sit in the cool of the evening  with a cheroot, a glass, and a pretty woman. Barryton rarely came off until  after midnight, so that no little unpleasantness ever broke the harmony of our  genial environment. Occasionally the chief engineer joined us, but not for  long. She used to freeze up whenever he drew near; and, try as he would, he  could scarcely prevail upon her to return him a civil answer. And this was sad,  because a word from her, a look, would have made him her abject slave.</p>
<p>I  see it now. It was playing with fire; but I was not sufficiently vain to  imagine that there could be a conflagration unless I heaped on the fuel and stirred  the embers. And that I was determined not to do, and though I found her an  extremely agreeable companion, I never forgot to treat her with due courtesy.  True, I was not blind, though she must have thought me so, seeing me ignore the  number of excellent openings that were offered for a better understanding.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,  they were pleasant nights, and as I think of them now I reproduce the whole  scene, feel the peculiar atmosphere with its cool smell of the sea. Again I see  the ships whose yellow riding-lights look like great golden stars swinging low  in the sky: the moon bursting away back over the hills: the stars glimmering  deep down into the sea. And then round about, and all over the still water,  suddenly comes the sound of the ships&rsquo; bells as the men on watch strike the  hour. The whole air is full of bells which the night and the water soften and  mellow to an infinite sweetness. And the strange light sets deep shadows round  the woman&rsquo;s eyes, out of which strange flashings come and go, and her voice  with its low, cooing sighs like sweet music that is but half understood.</p>
<p>Well,  we finished loading at last, and without any unnecessary delay set our nose  southward. But had I hoped that the presence of Captain Barryton would act as a  check upon his wife, I was speedily to be undeceived: though I had grown  extremely prudent, I found, as so many have found before me, the difficulty of  retracing my steps.</p>
<p>Then  came that which, knowing the nature of the woman, I feared, yet half expected.</p>
<p>It  was on the morning of the third day out, about that hour which trembles between  daylight and darkness. I had not long come up from below, and no thought of the  captain&rsquo;s wife was in my mind. For I was thinking of a little girl with sweet  eyes and a dainty head, who was waiting patiently for that letter which was to  say, &ldquo;Dearest, I have just been appointed to a command. There is no reason why  we should not marry now. Will you come to me, O my love!&rdquo; I was thinking of  this, I say, leaning on the rail of the bridge and picturing the flushed  gladness of that sweet face, when I felt a hand laid lightly on my shoulder.  Turning round, I encountered the burning eyes of the Malay woman. Though I had  a presentiment of impending evil, I think I betrayed no sign of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  morning,&rdquo; said I. &ldquo;You are up very early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have not been to bed,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are ill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am so sorry. Can I do anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  But this time her voice was so hoarse and muffled that I could scarcely  distinguish the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  came close to me and laid her hands on my shoulders, and I knew that every  pulse of her was throbbing with madness. Her beautiful mouth quivered like a  whipped child&rsquo;s; there was a starved longing in her look which was absolutely  painful to witness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  into my eyes, Stanbridge. Close, close,&rdquo; she added excitedly, drawing my face  down to hers. &ldquo;What do you see there!&rdquo; And all the time her hot breath was  burning my face, and her eyes shone so luridly that I dared not look into them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are excited&mdash;feverish,&rdquo; I began hesitatingly, withdrawing from her hands, the  palms of which burnt like fire. But I felt a fool, and half afraid in the  bargain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feverish,  yes, Stanbridge&mdash;feverish!&rdquo; and she laughed madly as she spoke.</p>
<p>I  backed farther from the man at the wheel, who stole an occasional glance in our  direction. She followed, and in the starboard corner of the bridge brought me  to bay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look  in my eyes, Stanbridge,&rdquo; she repeated once again. &ldquo;Tell me, do you know that  fever? It burns my heart; it burns my eyes till they ache; it burns my brain  till I feel that I am going mad. Stanbridge, Stanbridge!&rdquo; She flung her arms  about me; she pressed her burning face into my breast.</p>
<p>I  candidly admit that never was I in such an awkward predicament. Being  unaccustomed to a situation so embarrassing, I was at a complete loss as to the  better course to pursue. To encourage her would have been fatal; not to  encourage her would probably have an equally disastrous effect. I had not here  a woman of my own race to deal with, but a wild, passionate creature in whom  there was no power of restraint. A nature such as hers would overleap every  obstacle; no thin or thick coating of veneer could check the flow of savage  blood. If I valued my peace of mind I dared not spurn her; if I submitted to  her influence it meant being ruled like a slave. Nor could I temporise, for  fear she should mistake my meaning. Altogether I was in a position requiring  extreme circumspection, and I inwardly cursed myself for a blundering fool.</p>
<p>And  yet I feared that to temporise was the only course open to me. This was no ordinary  woman with the rigid, conventional notions of right and wrong, but a child of  nature, who threw herself madly, blindly, upon the bosom of her mother. Far  from subduing her wild nature, civilisation had but taught it the extremity of  passion.</p>
<p>So  with soft words and gentle pleadings I sought to pacify her, and though she  listened with commendable restraint to my feeble argument, her lips curled  disdainfully whenever I mentioned the words &ldquo;husband&rdquo; and &ldquo;duty.&rdquo; I confess  that I could not say much in honour of the husband, while duty was a nebulous  sort of thing which absolutely had no existence for her. Duty was synonymous  with inclination, and that swept her forward with a perfect whirlwind of  passion and regret. There was but the one awful cry&mdash;a cry which came from the  profoundest depths of a soul pregnant with remorse, and dread, and hope. &ldquo;I  love you, Stanbridge! Love me, love me!&rdquo; Unfortunately, I was unable to accede  to her request, but I hadn&rsquo;t the courage to say so.</p>
<p>I  blamed myself consumedly for this tragic development of the situation. I ought  to have foreseen what would happen. Perhaps I did in a way. Perhaps, too, my  prudence had been at fault; but, heaven! can a man be expected to study all  these things while looking into a pair of bright eyes? What kind of man would  he be, I wonder? Well, it might be playing with fire, but the pastime has its  fascination.</p>
<p>The  danger lay in the strange nature of the woman. There was no telling what she  would do next. So, to pacify her, I explained that my religion forbade me to  love her, as she already belonged to another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if I had not <i>him?</i>&rdquo; she said, pointing  away aft.</p>
<p>Well,  it would have been all the same to me, but I dared not admit as much. I&rsquo;m  afraid I did not fully appreciate such an intensely emotional young woman. I  misread her entirely if wisdom would ever govern her impulse. No drop of cold  blood leavened the whirling torrent which urged her onward. She only knew the  two extremes of love and hate, and between them her wild soul was buffeted.</p>
<p>So,  weakly temporising once more, I gave her to understand that Captain Barryton  was an insuperable bar to a closer intimacy between us, and I congratulated  myself on having devised such an excellent reason. I did not love the old man,  but I was forced to admit that he had an excuse for his existence.</p>
<p>She  laid her cheek against, my breast and thought for several moments. Then she  pulled my face down to hers and treated me as though I already belonged to her.  The deuce take it! I never thought I was such a muff!</p>
<p>I  saw her no more that day, which in a way was a relief, and yet almost a terror.  For my mind grew full of some exceedingly horrid misgivings, fostered by an  uncertainty which was absolutely intolerable.</p>
<p>But  the next morning, between the daylight and the dawn, she came to me on the  bridge, and, dropping at my feet, seized my hands and covered them with  passionate kisses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  am yours, Stanbridge,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;all yours. Nothing can separate us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  cannot be mine&mdash;and his.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His!&rdquo;  she laughed almost fiercely. &ldquo;His! He is gone. I am alone. I live for you, my  lord, only for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?  I do not understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come  with me, Stanbridge, and you shall see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She  rose, still retaining my hand, smiling at me in a way that made her face look  wonderfully soft and sweet. But though she was so solemn, and so calm, I felt  every nerve of me tingle with apprehension.</p>
<p>She  descended the ladder before me, but, upon reaching the deck, waited with  outstretched hand. There was no denying her sweet, imperious look; so I let her  take my hand, and in the same calm, stately way she led me aft, turning now and  again to smile on me and to murmur, &ldquo;For you, Stanbridge&mdash;everything for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When  we reached the deckhouse, which the captain had transformed into a cabin, she  stopped and put her finger to her lips. Then, slipping from my side, she walked  towards the window and looked in. At that moment the sun rushed up out of the  eastern sea.</p>
<p>When  she again turned her face to me it had grown deathly pale, and the early sun  flushed her burning eyes with a mad light; but her lips smiled almost sweetly  as she beckoned me to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  Stanbridge,&rdquo; she whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;Look&mdash;see what I have done for you, my  lord!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And  I looked, and with a gasp sprang back.</p>
<p>The  sunbeams, passing through the window, threw a broad shaft of light across the  dark cabin on to the bunk at the farther side, and there I saw the quaintly  carved handle of a Malay creese sticking out above the breast of a man.</p>
<p>She  saw the horror, the loathing in my face, and she fell before me and clasped my  knees, and murmured in a weak, whining voice, &ldquo;It was all for you,  Stanbridge&mdash;it was all for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  the moment I forgot what she was. I saw only the murderess at my feet, and I  threw her off with some bitter words. But instead of rising in anger, as I  thought she would, she grovelled in a heap upon the deck, sobbing and  murmuring, &ldquo;What have I done, Stanbridge, O my love!&rdquo; Scarcely knowing what I  did or said, I left her there and ran forward to waken the second mate and  acquaint him with the tragedy. The chief engineer being next door, I also awoke  him, and when we three returned to the deck Singapura was nowhere to be seen.  We went in to look at the old man, who lay there bathed in the glory of the  early sunshine. The knife had been driven straight into his heart, and, by the  frightened look of his face, death must have come to him with awful suddenness.</p>
<p>As  for the woman, no trace of her was discovered. As she could kill without  compunction, so without compunction could she die. My bitter words had awakened  her to a realisation of her crime: the sea had quenched for ever the fierce  flame of her passion. </p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="MissCherryBlossom"></a>Miss  Cherry-Blossom</b></h2>
<p>We had  frequently warned Brading to be more circumspect in his dealings with Miss  Cherry-Blossom, for it was an open secret to the habitual frequenters of  Ninko&rsquo;s <i>chaya</i>, or tea-house, that Kamakura, a native  gentleman of some pretension, had looked with condescension upon the pretty <i>geisha</i>. But one might as well have  offered advice to the typhoon, or sought by argument to stay its furious  course. Brading was a good sort, and we all liked him; but, while we duly  admired his virtues, we were not blind to his faults, chief among which was a  mulish obstinacy. This, under certain conditions, is an excellent  characteristic, and one that has had not a little to do with the building up of  this empire which we are all extolling; but at the same time it may  occasionally prove a trifle inconvenient. He declared that he cared not for Kamakura, nor fifty such,  and no one doubted him for a moment. Like most fellows who have no fear, he had  no wisdom either.</p>
<p>What  her real name was I never knew, and really it was a matter of no consequence;  but we called her Cherry-Blossom because we first saw her at Ninko&rsquo;s in the  spring when the cherry-bloom abounds everywhere, and she wore the sweet flower  in her hair and in her breast, and looked as sweet as the bloom itself.  Undoubtedly she created a favourable impression on our little party, and the  questions went round, Who is she? Where does she come from? And when the  putty-faced patron, Ninko, came our way he was received with a fusilade of  questions. Now, Ninko was accounted a shrewd man, and it was known that he was  as disreputable as he was shrewd, but his knowledge was great, and the men  found him useful. So they tolerated the rascal as creatures are tolerated  everywhere; for his <i>chaya</i> was  esteemed beyond all others, and his girls were renowned for their grace and  beauty.</p>
<p>The  putty-faced one received the attack with an ungainly shrugging of the  shoulders. Their excellencies were pleased to be facetious. What was wrong with  the girl? Did she not sing well? Was not her posturing in the dance all that  their exalted condescension desired? Perhaps she might dance for their  excellencies in a different fashion if&mdash;and again the fat shoulders rose with a  deprecating shrug. He was sorry, the rascal, if the girl did not please us, as  he always strove to propitiate those who condescended to honour his  contemptible hovel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  should think she does please us,&rdquo; said Brading, upon whom the girl had produced  an instantaneous effect. &ldquo;Where did you get her, Ninko!&rdquo; </p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninko&rsquo;s  eyes are everywhere,&rdquo; said one of the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They  need be,&rdquo; replied the patron, with a low bow, &ldquo;if I am to please your  illustrious excellencies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An  inscrutable smile played about his ugly mouth as he shuffled away. He knew his  visitors, and they knew him. After all, it mattered nothing who she was or  where she came from. That she had come to the <i>chaya</i> was the main fact; that she was pretty we had the witness of  our own senses.</p>
<p>Brading,  rashly impetuous always, exceeded himself upon this occasion. Never one upon  whom the niceties of circumspection had any considerable influence, he was not  inclined to let the grass grow beneath his feet. The girl had strongly appealed  to him, and a closer acquaintance with her was the natural outcome. So, in  spite of the affected protestations of the worthy Ninko, he made for the door  through which the little <i>geisha</i> had disappeared,  and with that determined, devil-may-care look on his face which I knew so well,  passed from sight.</p>
<p>Ninko  brought us some wine and a pack of cards. It was not often we came to the  tea-house now, and when we did we strove our best to make merry. Of course,  though not absolutely enthusiastic over the charms of the attendant houris, we  were not insensible to them; but we were more or less old hands, and felt no  keenness in the game. So we made merry in a highly decorous manner, treading,  perhaps not too lightly, on the corns of the estimable Ninko. Usually that  putty-faced one bore our pleasantries with consummate grace, and a calmness  which showed a close acquaintance with opprobrium; but to-night, and more  especially since the disappearance of Brading, he seemed hardly his impervious  self. Restless, void of his usual calm indifference, he continually threw  uneasy glances over his shoulder in the direction Brading had taken, and I  watched him with an interest which I might have found it extremely difficult to  explain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  long have you had her, Ninko?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  started, and instinctively turned to the door. Then his flabby face came back  my way, and his little eyes honoured me with a sharp, penetrating look. I had  no longer any doubt of the tenor of his thoughts. We understood each other,  Ninko and I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About  three weeks, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is a good girl, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninko&rsquo;s  girls are renowned for their virtues,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  excellency is pleased to recommend my contemptible hovel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  speak as I find it, Ninko. And the girl&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  yet, excellency. But the honourable Kamakura&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here  he ended abruptly, for at that moment the door through which Brading had  disappeared was suddenly dashed back, and that worthy appeared leading the  girl, Cherry-Blossom, by the hand.</p>
<p>Brading&rsquo;s  face was flushed with anger, and his eyes flashed darkly; but the girl, on the  contrary, was very pale, and she hung back as though she were an unwilling  participator in the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,  come,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be afraid. I wouldn&rsquo;t hurt you for the world, but  I couldn&rsquo;t leave you with him.&rdquo; Then he turned to us with a grim smile. &ldquo;Boys,  I have a rival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Brading, this begins to look interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devilish!&rdquo;  said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  native!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  contemptuous tone with which the word &ldquo;native&rdquo; was uttered conveyed with  singular directness the idea of the ignominy which had fallen upon the white  man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is his excellency the honourable Kamakura,&rdquo;  explained the obsequious Ninko.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  who the thunder is Kamakura?&rdquo;  cried Brading, swinging suddenly round on the patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please,  your illustrious condescension, the honourable Kamakura is one of our old nobility,&rdquo; said  Ninko.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  he? Then please tell him the next time he calls that my exalted magnanimity had  better not be put to the test a second time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  dare not, excellency. Kamakura  would raze my <i>chaya</i> to the ground. He  is rich&mdash;powerful. I dare not thwart him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must thwart him&mdash;or me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninko  shrugged his heavy shoulders and bowed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency,  you make my hard lot harder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  I saw&mdash;though I doubt if Brading did&mdash;the slightest suspicion of a sneer play  about the corners of Ninko&rsquo;s mouth. I had no doubt which master would be  served. This presumptuous foreigner had perforce to be treated civilly to his  face, otherwise Ninko&rsquo;s soft flesh might have suffered; and he hated pain this  good Ninko. But what the foreigner could not command was obedience. During his  interesting career the patron had been called upon to smooth the rough edges of  many difficulties, for he was a great diplomat, this excellent Ninko, and that  he had succeeded his present prosperity amply testified.</p>
<p>For  the next week Brading haunted the tea-house by day and night, sadly neglecting  his business in his anxiety to keep his eye on Cherry-Blossom and the hated  rival Kamakura.  I did my utmost to persuade him to abandon the girl, using an argument of some  singular selfishness and common-sense; but he had got beyond argument:  common-sense was a thing that never appealed to him. The girl liked him and he  liked her, and were it not for Kamakura,  aided by that putty-faced rascal, Ninko, things would right themselves in a  trice.</p>
<p>So  he said, and he meant it without doubt, and I have no valid reason for  believing otherwise; but, nevertheless, I sought in a friendly way to dissuade  him from going on with the affair, the end of which might not be foreseen. But  at my fears he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is  not an Englishman a match for a native?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope not&mdash;at underhand work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  think this fellow will go to extremes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  can say what a native will do&mdash; a native, rich, powerful: a rival?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  said he disdainfully. &ldquo;If he dares to look at my Cherry-Blossom again, I&rsquo;ll  wring his dirty little neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  Cherry-Blossom! This was excellent. He spoke as though he were already the man  in possession.</p>
<p>Some  two or three days after this he came into my office, and, dropping into a  chair, looked at me with troubled eyes. Notwithstanding the fact that I had  shown him but scant sympathy in this affair, he still honoured me with his  confidence, and wearisome as that was, I naturally was highly gratified at this  mark of his esteem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  suppose you&rsquo;ll think I&rsquo;m a fool!&rdquo; he began abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Brading!&rdquo; I protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  perhaps I am, but I think it better to be a fool over one thing than wise in  all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  bowed. There was a subtlety of thought here which was not lightly to be  received.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  have you been doing now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  like this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know, of course, that she&rsquo;s bound apprentice to Ninko?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One  naturally would have imagined as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  she cannot cancel her indentures for five years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  so&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  so I&rsquo;ve made him an offer&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!  To buy her out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  it will cost you&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  thousand <i>yen</i>.&rdquo; (dollars).</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, are you sure that you are not buying the tea-house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked annoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  knew you&rsquo;d call me a fool. But lord! Osman, if you&rsquo;d only heard her beg and  pray. She loves me, you see, and she is afraid of Ninko and Kamakura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  Kamakura&mdash;what  of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still  keen as a hound on the scent. But I think we&rsquo;ve doubled on him this time. Ninko  will cancel her indentures for a thousand dollars. To-morrow she shall be a  free woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His  enthusiasm was not infectious, for such a mad-brained scheme did not appeal to  me. Of all the follies he had ever committed, and their name was legion, this  was the most astounding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  will excuse me, Brading,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;but you are an idiot,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  laughed gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  knew you would say that; but, man, you forget&mdash;we love each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!  Take my advice: keep your money and let Kamakura  take the girl. A thousand dollars for a Jap! Why, you could buy half the  country for that sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want half the country,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I only want to free one woman from the  life she loathes. I would do it if it cost me ten times as much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  believe the idiot spoke without exaggeration. He was just the one who would  delight in such a magnificent piece of folly; for, crack-brained as he was,  there was always something chivalrous in his disposition; and though at first  he might have been tempted merely to rival Kamakura, I believed that a nobler sentiment  had gradually been awakened.</p>
<p>That  he was serious, however, I was shortly to see, for on the noon of the next day  he came to me, his face beaming with satisfaction, and carried me off to  Ninko&rsquo;s. He wanted a witness to the transaction, and he did me the honour to  say that I was the only man in the settlement whom he felt that he could freely  take into his confidence. Of course, I bowed and blushed. When one is unused to  such pretty trifles they are apt to prove slightly embarrassing.</p>
<p>Upon  arriving at the tea-house we at once demanded the presence of the illustrious  patron, a demand which the girls who came round us received with some lack of  composure. Indeed, I noticed that they glanced somewhat mysteriously at each  other, and that furtive looks were turned in the direction of my companion.</p>
<p>He,  apparently oblivious of this, peered here, there, and everywhere, searching  intently for some one who did not appear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where  is Cherry-Blossom!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The  girls made no answer, but with mysterious looks sidled off. Brading&rsquo;s eyes  followed them, and something like alarm fluttered in his face.</p>
<p>Presently  Ninko came, more obsequious and more pallid than usual, and in a tone of  infinite humility wanted to know to what he was indebted for the honour of our  illustrious visit.</p>
<p>Without  speaking, Brading drew a roll of bank-notes from his pocket and counted out a  thousand dollars. These he laid before the patron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo;  he said. &ldquo;A thousand <i>yen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninko  looked bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  excellency, I see. A thousand <i>yen</i>. It  is a large sum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That  is my affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed, excellency.&rdquo; But at the same time he utterly ignored the money.</p>
<p>This  was curious. I saw a black shade sweep suddenly across Brading&rsquo;s face as he  looked up at the inscrutable yellow man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,  it&rsquo;s good money, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently,  excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  why don&rsquo;t you take it and produce the indentures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  indentures, excellency?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninko&rsquo;s  look grew puzzled. It was painfully apparent that the poor man had not the  least notion of what my friend was driving at.</p>
<p>Brading  rose and bent across the table, and I saw the anger smouldering in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  dog,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve not sold me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  patron shrugged his heavy shoulders. It was not the first time he had been  assailed impolitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  excellency will explain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  told me that you would cancel the indentures of Cherry-Blossom for a thousand <i>yen</i>. There is the money. I suppose,  rascal as you are, you are capable of fulfilling a business contract?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  have that reputation, excellency&mdash; when I enter into one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How!&rdquo;  cried Brading, &ldquo;when you enter into one? What the deuce do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely  that your excellency, who does not speak our language quite perfectly, has made  a slight mistake in taking for a contract what was merely thrown out as a  suggestion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was rather clever of the rogue, though a palpable lie. Brading knew Japanese  well enough to make no mistake of that sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninko,&rdquo;  he said sternly, &ldquo;this will not do. You must not trifle with me. You know  perfectly well there was no mistake. A thousand <i>yen</i> was the sum. Here is the money&mdash;where is the girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brading&rsquo;s  face was growing set and hard. One who deals with the peoples of the East must  be ready to strike. Otherwise, he will get no satisfaction. It is a hard lesson  to learn. Some men never learn it. They go under.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo;  said the patron, whose eyes were as sharp as his wits, &ldquo;I am sorry to say that  the girl is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!  What do you mean by gone!&rdquo; He stood erect without flinching. His mouth hardened  a little, perhaps; but his voice was very low and steady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  disappeared last night, excellency, and has not been seen since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It  was a facer for Brading, but he took it splendidly. Advancing softly, he seized  the patron by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  lie to me, Ninko. She is gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,  indeed, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,  I know not. With some thief, no doubt. She was always a bad one. But the law  shall speak&mdash;the law&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  stopped suddenly, for those iron fingers were eating into his flesh: his arm  had been twisted nigh to breaking point. &ldquo;With whom went she, Ninko?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  voice was cold and steady, but it cut like a sword.</p>
<p>Again  he felt those cruel muscles begin to stir. He sought to shake himself free, but  the wrench sent the pain shivering to his brain. Those iron fingers were as  remorseless as death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With  Kamakura,  excellency. She insisted. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  did he pay you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifteen  hundred, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brading  dropped the man&rsquo;s arm, and turned to me with a grim smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m  afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  ought I to do with this intolerable rascal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Brading, business is business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay,  of course,&rdquo; and he laughed bitterly. Then turning to the illustrious Ninko, he  said, &ldquo;A shabby trick, Ninko, but one I might have expected from such a dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  patron&rsquo;s heavy shoulders went up again. &ldquo;Can your excellency&rsquo;s illustrious  wisdom blame me? I am a poor man. I do not work for pleasure. The exalted Kamakura gave fifteen  hundred. Your excellency only offered one thousand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ninko,  in spite of all thy wickedness and thy knavery, thou art nothing better than a  fool. I would have given thee two thousand <i>yen</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ninko  knitted his brows, perplexed; yet something he saw in Brading&rsquo;s face convinced  him of his folly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  I am an honest man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your excellency should have had her in spite of Kamakura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked with longing eyes at the bundle of bank-notes which Brading lifted  indifferently from the table and dropped as carelessly into his pocket. Poor  Ninko. For the first time in his life he had let his private feelings interfere  with business. There was no knowing what sum Cherry-Blossom might not have  brought if he had only skilfully played off the rivals one against the other.</p>
<p>Well,  there was nothing more to do, so, without acknowledging Ninko&rsquo;s obsequious  salutation, we left the tea-house, and I thought the low titter of the girls  followed us down the road. Not that that was of much consequence. In my heart I  was glad Brading had failed.</p>
<p>But  he took the matter not so philosophically. That he was really fond of the girl  I had no doubt; that his self-love was wounded was equally obvious. The two  combined gave birth to a mad obstinacy.</p>
<p>We  walked on for some time in silence, and from the occasional glances I stole at  his gloomy face I could see the black spirit gathering. Never one lightly to  bear a slight, it would have surprised me greatly had he shown no signs of  retaliation. Discretion formed no part of his composition. His philosophy might  be summed up in one word&mdash;fight.</p>
<p>After  a time he spoke. I knew he would, and I accordingly waited for him to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of  course, this sort of thing is intolerable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  to be bested by a native!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!  The girl went to the best market.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  she couldn&rsquo;t help herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  shall find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  you are wise, you will do nothing of the kind. Kamakura is of her own race; he is rich,  unscrupulous. It is not likely that he will tolerate the least interference on  your part. Moreover, my dear Brading &mdash;between ourselves&mdash;is the game worth the  candle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t understand, Osman. To you, of course, she is nothing&mdash;only a native; but  to me she is much more. You will say there are hundreds such, but I do not see  one other. She believes in me, she loves me, and I have promised that Kamakura shall not come  between us. That promise I must keep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  knew it was no use arguing with him; and, truth to tell, I couldn&rsquo;t. If they  were really fond of each other, how could I counsel abandonment? I might have  thought the whole affair both sad and foolish, but I could not forget that in  such foolishness a mortal is often blessed.</p>
<p>We  parted with an affectionate shake of the hand. He knew what was passing in my  mind. I read his like a book. I hoped, but feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good  luck to you, Brading!&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,  old fellow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>About  a week after he slipped once more into my office, and as he came towards me I  saw that his face was beaming with happiness. Evidently the course of true love  was running smoothly at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  all right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen her. She loathes Kamakura; she loves me. It was rather a  difficult enterprise. She was well guarded, but I promised her, you see, and I  always like to keep a promise&mdash;especially to a lady.&rdquo; He laughed softly to  himself. The triumph over Kamakura  was exquisite. But I could see that he had something else up his sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  now?&rdquo; I asked, for this seemed to me but the beginning of the end, not the end  itself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  he said, &ldquo;I have not had a holiday for a long time. Early to-morrow morning the <i>Yokohama Mara</i> sails for Nagasaki. I shall go by  her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  is highly probable that she will go too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have outwitted the native?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  smiled complacently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Osman, could you possibly imagine any other ending!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2 align="center"><b><a name="TheSilkenCord"></a>The Silken  Cord</b></h2>
<p>Ever  since the episode of the &ldquo;Stolen Emperor,&rdquo; when I rendered his Imperial  Majesty, the Son of Heaven, a personal service, I have been a sort of  privileged individual in Peking, and within the sacred precincts of the  Forbidden City. It was here I often came in contact with Loh-wi-Kung, one of  the numerous officials of the celestial court. He was a fine-looking man, some  thirty or thirty-five years of age, handsome as his race allows, well knit and  splendidly proportioned. A general favourite at court, or, at least, as general  a favourite as one could be among that envious crowd, he had been but lately  promoted to the position of a Grand Secretary to the Emperor, and all people  predicted that a vice-royalty would naturally follow.</p>
<p>As  for Loh himself, he seemed to entertain no foolish dreams of any such exalted  post; and when I jokingly questioned him as to the probability of such a high  mark of imperial favour, he shook his head. There was a great difference  between writing a royal letter and governing a royal province.</p>
<p>The  fact is, Loh had not carved a vice-royalty out of his reputation: it was not  one out of which a vice-royalty could be carved. True, he was a favourite of  the Emperor, he was also a scholar of some pretensions; but he was a man of a  somewhat equivocal reputation&mdash;a libertine, a debauchee. When the Emperor forgot  his dignity he herded with fellows like Loh; when an event of moment loomed  upon the horizon, he called to his council a totally different class of men.</p>
<p>All  the same, Loh and the gentlemen of his kidney came in for most of the good  things of this life, and but for his presumption he might still be basking in  the royal smiles of his imperial master. It is natural that contact with  royalty must rob it of some of its terrors; it is even possible, in some  instances, that royalty may marvel at its own glory; but even when most  dissolute, it has a sort of drunken dignity which is apt to prove dangerous.  Loh, wise in general knowledge, overlooked one essential. He forgot that the  pallid youth who occasionally condescended to hang on his arm was the absolute  lord and master of some four hundred millions of human beings.</p>
<p>That  Loh was an accomplished gentleman was indisputable; that he was extremely  handsome no impartial observer could deny. I also thought that he was something  more than a libertine. I believed that he had it in him to rise to distinction  if he would only go to work in a proper manner; but he was cynical to a degree,  and always made fun of my serious proposals.</p>
<p>With  clear eyes he had chosen the muddy path&mdash;his shoes were thick with mud. He had  gained the Emperor&rsquo;s friendship, but at the loss of his own self-respect. I am  of opinion that he did not think the gain of the one outweighed the loss of the  other.</p>
<p>There  was a tone of desperate pessimism about the man which attracted me in spite of  myself. Shame bred it, and pride brought the bitter words to the tongue. The  Grand Secretary Loh, the confidant of the Fount of All Wisdom, was a miserable  man.</p>
<p>One  day he came to me in my office, stealthily closed the door and locked it after  him, and then stood staring at me with quick, inquisitive eyes. Every action,  even the way he breathed, showed me that the man laboured under great  excitement. His face was more pallid than usual; his long fingers beat  inconsequent tattoos upon the breast of his coat. It was perfectly obvious that  something serious had happened. </p>
<p>Suddenly  he shot out his open hand, saying, &ldquo;You are my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  think I understand you, Clandon. You have the cold blood of the Englishman, the  thoughtful brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Loh, you flatter me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  do not mean to flatter, Clandon; no Chinese compliments, as you call them. I  only think you are not so great a fool as I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I insist, my dear Loh; you are very kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  waved his hand deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  insist that you are not so great a fool. If you were, should I come to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  I protest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.  How many times have you said, &lsquo;Loh, you are a yellow turnip; you fail utterly  to do yourself justice?&rsquo; Tell me, how many times?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  hope I was never so rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  threw away the husk, but preserved the kernel. The rudeness was forgiven for  the wisdom within it. Is a man a swine that he should lead the swine&rsquo;s life of  horrid indolence? Was imagination given him to gloze his imperfections? You are  a wise man, Clandon; tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It  was scarcely necessary that you should come to me for such an obvious reply.  What has happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked at the door, then he turned once more and faced me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clandon,  you are my friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo;  said I, &ldquo;that it is you who have come to me. I have not sought your confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon  me.&rdquo; Again he looked round. Then he uttered oracularly the Chinese proverb,  &ldquo;When you converse in the road, remember there are men in the grass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are perfectly safe here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,  Clandon, I&rsquo;m in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  looked at him without speaking. It frequently happens that the surest way to  obtain a secret is to evince but slight curiosity concerning it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  are not inquisitive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Loh, I rely entirely upon your wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For  a few moments he remained silent, as if cogitating within himself. Then he  said, &ldquo;I am in disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here,  too, I might have indulged in a little cheap moralising upon the fickleness of  princes, but out of deference to his feelings I refrained. At the same time, I  was not a little surprised. I should have given the secretary a longer lease of  royal favour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  did your wisdom let you stumble so foolishly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  looked hard at me, lowered his voice, and whispered, &ldquo;Woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This  was odd. That a stupid white man should make a fool of himself for a woman was  a recognised form of idiocy; but that a philosophic Chinaman should court  disgrace for such a worthless cause was enough to make the learned Confucius  turn in his grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  dear Loh,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;you disappoint me horribly. Who is the lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Princess Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  sister of the Emperor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  secretary bowed his head and murmured, &ldquo;Unhappy Loh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  the Emperor knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If  he did, think you I should be alive to answer that question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  did not. And yet the Emperor must know something, else how could the secretary  be in disgrace?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He  knows nothing for certain,&rdquo; Loh answered in reply to my query; &ldquo;but I believe  he is growing suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  you are not absolutely in disgrace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,  but I feel that I am tottering upon the verge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then  draw back while it is yet time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  do not understand. We have met many times in secret. We love each other. Heaven  made us one for the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut,  tut! What do you know of heaven? The Princess Me is betrothed to Chung, the  President of the Board of Ceremonies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But  she loathes him. He is old and hideous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not  so very old, and not so very hideous. Remember, friend Loh, you look with a  rival&rsquo;s eyes. You have been exceedingly indiscreet. The Emperors word is law.  The Princess Me is not for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A  hot word leapt to his tongue, but with an effort he held it back. An ominous  flush swept his brow&mdash;the spirit of revolt had risen to blood heat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My  friend,&rdquo; I said, rising and taking his hand, &ldquo;be wise. Are you strong enough to  pit your strength against the Emperor? I think not. You come to me for advice,  I give it, and it proves unpalatable. Yet I beg of you to listen, for it is the  friend who speaks. I know not how far this affair has gone, but I beg of you  not to let it go farther. You must renounce the Princess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  cannot. You do not know. Why, already she&mdash;&rdquo; Then he stopped suddenly and looked  confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell  me nothing,&rdquo; I said, seeing that I dared not be sympathetic. &ldquo;It is folly for a  man like you to ape the puling boy. Why let that vanity of thine set its heart  on a star? Go home, friend Loh, and ponder over what I have said, and think not  ill of me because I speak harsh words. Good medicine is bitter to the taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  went away with bowed head and a face which betokened the keenest  disappointment. Like many of my Chinese friends, he came to me for advice, much  as one would consult an oracle; and when I spoke with the plain tongue of a  reasoning man I invariably dispelled the oracular illusion. But like most  people whose interests clash with reason, though the two should go hand in  hand, he was profuse in his thanks for my advice, though I feared he had no  intention of carrying it into effect.</p>
<p>The  intrigue with the Princess Me was not renounced, as I, knowing the man, really did  not believe it would be. Assuming many disguises, he repeatedly saw her, and,  undoubtedly, his continued success bred in him a recklessness which conduced to  his downfall. One night, disguised as a coolie woman, he was seen to leave the  apartments of the Princess. The chamberlain who saw him, mistaking him for a  thief, seized him. Loh fought furiously, but in the struggle his wig fell off.  Aroused by the noise, the attendants came rushing forward, and instantly a  dozen menials were in the possession of his secret.</p>
<p>Knowing  that the intrigue must now come to the light, Loh, who was released as soon as  he was identified, hurried at once to his home, and, boldly facing the danger,  spent the rest of that night in preparing a memorial to the throne. In this he  reiterated his undying affection for the Princess, and his devotion to the  illustrious Son of Heaven, whose royal clemency he begged. It was couched in  the glaringly sycophantic form of such documents, a form calculated to sicken any  one but a king, and not until it was written and rewritten again and again did  he justly appreciate the bold step he was taking. Then his nerve failed him,  and he thought of flight; but that would mean ruin, perhaps death, to all his family,  and his filial piety would not permit him to bring shame upon his honoured parents.  For, with all their vices, the Chinese have one virtue&mdash;they do honour their  parents. Of how many nations can we say the same?</p>
<p>With  the advent of day Loh forwarded his humble petition to the throne, and all  through the long hours that followed he paced his rooms in an agony of  expectation. But the day brought no tidings. After a certain hour he knew that  no communication would leave the palace. That hour came and passed. He breathed  more freely. Afterwards he partook of food, the first for many hours.</p>
<p>The  next day came and went, and still no word from the throne. Loh&rsquo;s spirits rose.</p>
<p>The  Emperor had not forgotten the friendship which had existed between them.  Perhaps he might even forgive? The secretary saw something like his old face  staring at him from the mirror.</p>
<p>But  at noon of the third day a court messenger arrived at the door, and into the  secretary&rsquo;s own hands presented his fate. Loh received it humbly, as one who is  honoured by the imperial condescension; but his face grew very pale, and his  dry tongue beat vainly against the dry roof of his mouth. It was his fate. What  was his fate?</p>
<p>He  examined it closely. He knew that wrapping well&mdash;the imperial seal was still  intact. A dozen times he made as though he would break it, and a dozen times  his trembling fingers seemed powerless to obey. At last when he did, he found  that the package contained no word of writing&mdash; nothing but a silken cord.</p>
<p>His  face blanched to a ghastly whiteness; he staggered back, his hand to his  throat, and gasped. Then he tottered to a seat, and sat shivering like one  suddenly stricken with ague. Loh&rsquo;s sun was about to set.</p>
<p>This  Silken Cord was the last mark of the Emperor&rsquo;s favour. It meant that the  secretary was to die, but it allowed him the great honour of taking his own  life, an honour only permitted the highest in the land. Strangulation, ensuring  as it does an unmutilated body, necessarily ensures an unmutilated soul;  whereas decapitation, mutilating the body, also mutilates the soul, which  causes an inextricable amount of confusion in the other world, where mutilated  souls are constantly rushing about in search of their own heads.</p>
<p>Being  a true Chinaman, and well grounded in the traditions of his race, he could not  look upon this wordless message as anything short of an undeserved mark of  imperial favour. To be permitted the privilege of taking his own life showed in  what remarkable esteem he was held by the Emperor. Only the very highest in the  land are accorded such a distinguished honour. Therefore, as one in duty bound,  he felt much pride in having achieved such eminence in the State. And yet&mdash;such  was his black ingratitude&mdash;he was not sure that he really appreciated the honour  at its proper value. The Silken Cord was finely woven, and it would bear his  weight to perfection; yet he seemed to entertain an insuperable objection to  it. The fact is, he did not want to commit the happy dispatch; ungracious as it  may seem, he did not even thank the Son of Heaven for his pretty present.</p>
<p>Yet  how could he avoid his fate? He pondered deeply, but no avenue of escape  offered itself. Though he fled from the city he could not take his parents with  him, and to leave them behind meant that they would suffer in his place. For  Chinese law, or justice, distinguishes little between the individual and his  family. If it cannot punish the one, it will the other. Therefore all thought  of flight must be abandoned. If he were not the basest of ingrates, he would go  down upon his knees and thank the Emperor for his imperial consideration.</p>
<p>And  yet, strangely enough, he did not want to die, though given the imperial  sanction to die in such a magnificent manner. Perhaps the thought of the  Princess Me made him cling foolishly to life; perhaps the thought of the grief  of his aged parents; perhaps of the annihilation of a certain proud and  pleasure-loving individual. Loh was a philosopher, and he saw but vaguely the  end of the journey. Yet the hours were creeping on, and he had done no packing.  At sunset the emissaries of the Emperor would appear. They must find him  swinging by the Silken Cord.</p>
<p>Not  having seen him during the two or three days which he spent at home awaiting  the reply to his petition, and meanwhile having heard a rumour of what had taken  place, I approached an official and made inquiries, and learnt the whole story.  As the official in question was just starting for Loh&rsquo;s house to see that the  imperial behest had been obeyed, I offered to accompany him, and together we  set out.</p>
<p>Arriving  there we found the house in gloom, while the dreary sounds of lamentation  vibrated in the air. The father met us at the door, and between his sobbings  and his moanings welcomed us to the house of sorrow. His son, the flower of his  race, the pride of his life, was no more; but, thanks to the exalted  magnanimity of the Son of Heaven, his paragon of filial piety had entered the  land of spirits with a head on his shoulders. For such right royal clemency,  the heart-broken father felt sure that heaven would lay up ten thousand merits  for the Root of All Wisdom. Then, sounding once more his dreary note of  lamentation, he led us slowly to an inner room, in the middle of which,  suspended from a beam, floated the body of Loh.</p>
<p>Though  somewhat distorted, there was little difficulty in recognising him. The clothes  were the same as those he had worn when last I saw him, and though I did not  scrutinise his face very closely, I shuddered as I thought how hideous death  makes a man.</p>
<p>We  turned away fully satisfied that the Emperor&rsquo;s behest had been obeyed, and I  sent some kind thoughts after the soul of Loh. Again the weeping father  preceded us, proclaiming the virtues of his son, and attesting to the  magnanimity of the Emperor. Then, as he handed us tea, he favoured us with a few  particulars concerning the doings of his son before that imperially-honoured  one undertook the happy dispatch; and among other things I learnt that, just  previous to his suicide, Loh had paced madly up and down his garden for at  least an hour, wildly bemoaning his fate. Indeed, he walked straight from the  garden to his room, and, with the silken cord which the Emperor had so  thoughtfully presented, put an end to his miserable life.</p>
<p>Of  course we offered our condolence. It was very sad, yet we all three admitted  that the Emperor had behaved in a way that was worthy of the imperial  tradition. The star was great, but if it entered into a conflict with the sun  it would be eaten up. But for reasons of my own I asked the father a question  or two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  said that the lamented Loh went straight from his garden to the room?&rdquo; He  stopped his sighing and eyed me with a singularly penetrating look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even  so,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  that, previous to committing the happy dispatch, he walked in the garden for at  least an hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  hesitated a moment or two. Then he said, &ldquo;Even so, your excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor  fellow!&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Poor Loh! We were excellent friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At  this the fond father burst once more into tears, in the midst of which we left  him. As we walked along my companion turned to me and said, &ldquo;What made you ask  those questions about the garden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That  was the worst of a man in my position. To those who knew me, my every word, my  every action had some hidden meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  must not forget that Loh was a close friend of mine, and that my grief for him  is only exceeded by my reverence for the Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But  what I really saw was the pair of new shoes which the suicide wore, shoes  absolutely unsoiled, and I wondered how he could have walked in his garden for  an hour without soiling them.</p>
<p>But  I had sufficient reticence to keep the thought to myself. The man beside me,  court creature and sycophant, would have made much of my suspicions, and  probably would have reaped extraordinary credit for a little ordinary acumen.  In such a state of society he who was the last to gain the august ear had the  best chance of preferment. Moreover, this man was quite satisfied. He would  duly certify that with his own eyes he had beheld the Secretary Loh hanging by  his neck. Equally so would I. Then why set the calm mind throbbing with  suspicion?</p>
<p>And  after all, what was there in this suspicion? It is true that if Loh from his  garden had gone and straightway hanged himself, his shoes must have shown the  wear and tear of walking. And yet, who was to say that he had not changed them  and put on a new pair for the journey? A Chinese corpse is usually well  dressed. It must make an excellent first appearance in the next world.</p>
<p>Yet,  unexpected, the thought had come, and having arrived, it seemed extremely like  making a long stay. My mind was ill at ease. I would have given a good deal for  the permission further to examine the corpse. I would have gone back then and  there if I could have done so without arousing the suspicions of my companion.  Even when I tried to break away he insisted upon my journeying with him to the  palace, at the gates of which we separated.</p>
<p>I  at once retraced my steps to Loh&rsquo;s house, and was again greeted by the  sorrowing father. Could I look once more upon the face of my beloved friend,  the pride of his race, the flower of manhood, the soul of chivalry? The father  wept copiously, but amid his tears I learnt that Loh had been taken down, that  the coffin had already closed upon him, and that he would be buried secretly,  as one who had died a shameful death. Expressing my deep regret at not being  able once more to gaze upon the face of my friend, I took my departure, my  suspicions not in the least allayed. It was evident that Loh was not  appreciated above board.</p>
<p>From  a personal point of view his case interested me deeply, and for some  considerable time, in one form or another, I devoted much attention to his  particular domicile. But nothing coming of it, I began to make inquiries  concerning the Princess Me, and I learnt that she was practically a prisoner in  her own apartments, her royal brother and lord being undecided how to punish  her. It was said that her marriage with Chung was broken off, as the Emperor  had judged her unworthy of an alliance with that exalted official; but what the  facts really were no one seemed exactly to know. Only one thing was certain.  The Princess Me was in disgrace.</p>
<p>One  day, as I lounged beside the gates that led to the women&rsquo;s quarters, I saw a  coolie woman, her face half smothered with a big bonnet, come staggering along  beneath a huge bundle which she carried on her head. The bundle, being soft,  hung almost to her shoulders, so that I got but an indifferent glance of her as  she passed me. I saw her look my way and as quickly turn again&mdash;almost too  quickly for one who would avoid suspicion. I watched her through the gate, and  then advanced to the guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who  is that coolie with the bundle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The  Princess&rsquo;s washerwoman, excellency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A  strapping wench,&rdquo; said I, giving him a meaning look.</p>
<p>He  smiled. &ldquo;Quite hopeless. I have tried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She  is an old hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On  the contrary, excellency, she has only been coming here two weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How  often does she come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice  a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I  smiled as I whispered, &ldquo;Courage, my brave soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He  said something, but what I don&rsquo;t remember, for my eyes were following the  washerwoman as she approached a bend in the path. Would she look round?  Something told me that she would, notwithstanding a cold, calculating mistrust  of conjecture. And yet the intuition proved correct. As she rounded the bend  the great bundle on her head slowly turned. I knew that the quick, black eyes  were looking back. I walked away from the gate feeling the best of friends with  myself, and all because a coolie woman had honoured me with a glance of her  black eye. In fact, I had already made up my mind to see more of her, and with  that intention I took my seat at the window of a restaurant which commanded a  view of the gates, and ordered something to eat. And yet the meal was cooked,  eaten, and paid for, and the second cigar half-way through before my patience  was rewarded.</p>
<p>She  came towards me, a somewhat similar bundle on her head, and as she approached I  saw her quick, comprehensive glances shoot from side to side. That she did not  see me I felt certain; but from my coign of vantage I could see without being  seen. When she had passed I went out into the street and followed her.</p>
<p>For  a long time I was in doubt as to whether she knew she was followed or not, and  this rather undermined the foundations of the imaginary edifice which I had so  laboriously constructed. It was obviously natural that a coolie woman who had  no secrets would never dream of doubting her own insignificance. Such a woman  would march straight on to her goal, never turning to right or left. And this  was exactly what this woman did, striding sturdily forward as though oblivious  of all the world. My doubts began to multiply like a ready reckoner. I was  beginning to feel glad that this was not an official mission.</p>
<p>Hitherto  the woman had been making for one of the poorer parts of the city, but now she  suddenly turned to the left and shot off at an acute angle, I after her.  Through many streets she led me, now up, now down, and yet always nearing one  point. That point was Loh&rsquo;s house. She approached it without hesitation, but  instead of entering at the front door, made her way round to the back. A high  wall enclosed the garden in which poor Loh had taken his last earthly walk.</p>
<p>By  this time it was almost dark, and as the woman fumbled with the gate I advanced  noiselessly and laid my hand on her shoulder. She sprang back with a slight  exclamation, and instantly a knife flashed in the twilight.</p>
<p>Stepping  back with a smile, I said, &ldquo;Why so suspicious, my moon-faced divinity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What  do you want?&rdquo; she answered in a low voice, a voice which quivered with  agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely  to see your pretty face. I have come far, stimulated by the breath of hope.&rdquo;  She turned, and without speaking began to fumble at the lock. &ldquo;You are not  inquisitive,&rdquo; I continued; &ldquo;you do not ask how far. Let me tell you: from the  gate which leads to the apartments of the Princess Me &mdash; the Princess Me for  whom my good friend Loh committed the happy dispatch. Is it not a little  curious that the woman who washes for the Princess should also wash for his  parents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman stopped fumbling with the gate and faced me, apparently gaining courage  from the growing darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  have dogged me? You are a spy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  if I admit as much&mdash;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  say that you are a dog of the street, to be kicked and beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And  yet it is possible that you would regret doing either, for when a dog is kicked  he sometimes turns and bites. But this dog is of another breed. He likes to do  good, to sound the alarm when danger approaches. He is not a very wise dog, but  he is just a little bit wiser than the other dogs about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your  words are strange,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but your tone is friendly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I  was the friend of Loh&mdash;I am the friend of all on whom the world frowns. It is  not in accordance with established wisdom that the washerwoman of the Princess  Me should come, even by a roundabout way, from the palace to the home of the  imperially-honoured Loh. If the official blockheads knew, even they might  suspect something. For I must tell you that though Loh walked direct from his  garden to the room in which we found him hanging, the shoes the dead man wore  were absolutely new. Most remarkable indeed. He might have changed them, of  course; only he didn&rsquo;t. Luckily the official who was with me did not notice  such a trifling detail. If he had, he might have examined the dead man more  closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The  woman was silent for a moment or two. Then she said, &ldquo;You speak like a friend.  What would you advise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You  run great risk in visiting the Princess, because somebody may presently trace  the connection between this house and the palace. Doubtless you have a  sweetheart? Try and persuade him to go with you to Hong-Kong. There you will be  under English law, beyond the reach of the Emperor and all his mandarins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In  a moment the woman was on her knees before me, kissing my hands and murmuring  broken words of devotion. And then my fingers curled round hers in a hearty  grip.</p>
<p>Having  sown the seeds, I left time to ripen the harvest, and it ripened with a  quickness which was truly abnormal. Within a week the news spread among us  officials that the Princess Me was missing, and my inability to discover her  whereabouts has always been used against me by my enemies. But about three  months after, the Princess having been given up for dead, I received a curious  epistle from Hong Kong, which purported to be the account of a man who had  received the Silken Cord from the Emperor, but who had so far disobeyed the Son  of Heaven as to purchase a substitute, which he did for a very reasonable sum.  But though the real offender had played his game with extreme ingenuity, he  overlooked the fact that a man cannot walk in his garden without soiling his  shoes. In a kind of postscript was the added information that a certain coolie washerwoman  had prevailed upon her sweetheart to accompany her to Hong   Kong.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding  the sneers of my enemies, I really do believe I know what became of the  Princess Me.</p>
